This thread will be dedicated to the most basic of heroin related questions asked in Other Drugs. It would be ideal if you (the users) could post your new basic questions in this thread, but if you do make a new thread for it, we will try to have it merged in here.

> #3 heroin is the base form, usually found in Europe, Australia, and pretty much anywhere that is not North and South America. It isnt readily soluble in water, so it can't be IVed in its natural state, but with a little extra work, it can be IVed, but most often it is smoked.

I was not aware most of the H in Australia was base and can't be IV'd without extra work? [According to this report by the Crime Commission](http://www.crimecommission.gov.au/content/publications/iddr_2003_04/05_HEROIN.pdf), #4 is the most commonly found type of H in Oz.

awesome thread, cant believe this hasn't been done already.


what about with powder(maybe tar as well, never had it in my area) the vinegar smell? ive heard people say that when you have a strong vinegar scent it tends to be stronger quality, and im not sure if this is 100% true, but my experience has backed it up.

well done man.  i think a lot of beginners will like that they can come here in OD and get all their questions answered all at once.  


i would add that in some cities, like dayton, for example, that it comes in geltabs as well.

Great Thread , Sixpartseven . Theres alot of very useful information in there that I think will really help out first time users . And i would also like to really stress the fact that under any circumstance you should never share a needle with someone. Ive seen alot of people catch tings in that way and it is very hearbreaking for their family . Please be careful everyone and always start low and work ure way up when using this stuff , its very easy to Od if your not opiate tolerant.

Thanks guys.


I'll edit it to reflect the suggestions youve made. I think to make this thing really good it will take contributions from all of you to fill it up with every last bit of basic info we can think of, so that just like JV said, beginners can find everything they need to know in one spot.


Phrozen or anyone else: In the dangers of IVing section, could you help me out with that. Phrozen, I know you and I have discussed it before, so you know what Im talking about. I just cant remember the names and what each one of them is.

Not to nitpick but I wanted to add some westcoast slangterms-

Works/ (out)fits= needles

Chiva/ hop/ black= heroin


Add: Has anyone hear heard or used the term skag ever? Seems archaic but it could be regional. Same with horse actually.

I've only heard skag being used by BL'ers from the UK or, in real life, older Australians. Most youger Australians call it H or smack.

Awesome thread 6/7.


Haven't finished reading it all yet but one thing I can throw into the mix is that UK heroin is almost always light brown powder. This is #4 , correct me if I'm wrong?

Heroin is diacetylmorphine. Vinegar is acetic acid. As mentioned vinegar would make sense as a byproduct.


However, it could also be that the acetylation process causes a vinegar smell too. I have some bulk acetyl-l-carnitine that smells like vinegar too.


Often , but not always, it can be a good sign IME. Most of the more whitish powder we get here reeks of vinegar and it is good.

#3 can be the same color. You are right that #4 can be found in the UK, but generally, from what Ive read, #3 is most popular in European countries.

New Jersey.. At the dope spot that I would frequent a lot there was an old guy in a wheelchair on the corner saying "I got toys!" to everyone who was there coppin shit. He'd sell you a fresh "toy" for a small price.

Awesome thread 6/7.


Haven't finished reading it all yet but one thing I can throw into the mix is that UK heroin is almost always light brown powder. This is #4 , correct me if I'm wrong?

Heroin is diacetylmorphine. Vinegar is acetic acid. As mentioned vinegar would make sense as a byproduct.


However, it could also be that the acetylation process causes a vinegar smell too. I have some bulk acetyl-l-carnitine that smells like vinegar too.


Often , but not always, it can be a good sign IME. Most of the more whitish powder we get here reeks of vinegar and it is good.

#3 can be the same color. You are right that #4 can be found in the UK, but generally, from what Ive read, #3 is most popular in European countries.

New Jersey.. At the dope spot that I would frequent a lot there was an old guy in a wheelchair on the corner saying "I got toys!" to everyone who was there coppin shit. He'd sell you a fresh "toy" for a small price.

I was not aware most of the H in Australia was base and can't be IV'd without extra work? [According to this report by the Crime Commission](http://www.crimecommission.gov.au/content/publications/iddr_2003_04/05_HEROIN.pdf), #4 is the most commonly found type of H in Oz.

i would add that in some cities, like dayton, for example, that it comes in geltabs as well.

Great Thread , Sixpartseven . Theres alot of very useful information in there that I think will really help out first time users . And i would also like to really stress the fact that under any circumstance you should never share a needle with someone. Ive seen alot of people catch tings in that way and it is very hearbreaking for their family . Please be careful everyone and always start low and work ure way up when using this stuff , its very easy to Od if your not opiate tolerant.

Thanks guys.


I'll edit it to reflect the suggestions youve made. I think to make this thing really good it will take contributions from all of you to fill it up with every last bit of basic info we can think of, so that just like JV said, beginners can find everything they need to know in one spot.


Phrozen or anyone else: In the dangers of IVing section, could you help me out with that. Phrozen, I know you and I have discussed it before, so you know what Im talking about. I just cant remember the names and what each one of them is.

Not to nitpick but I wanted to add some westcoast slangterms-

Chiva/ hop/ black= heroin


Add: Has anyone hear heard or used the term skag ever? Seems archaic but it could be regional. Same with horse actually.

I've only heard skag being used by BL'ers from the UK or, in real life, older Australians. Most youger Australians call it H or smack.

Ive seen alot of people catch tings in that way and it is very hearbreaking for their family . Please be careful everyone and always start low and work ure way up when using this stuff , its very easy to Od if your not opiate tolerant.

Thanks guys.


I'll edit it to reflect the suggestions youve made. I think to make this thing really good it will take contributions from all of you to fill it up with every last bit of basic info we can think of, so that just like JV said, beginners can find everything they need to know in one spot.


Phrozen or anyone else: In the dangers of IVing section, could you help me out with that. Phrozen, I know you and I have discussed it before, so you know what Im talking about. I just cant remember the names and what each one of them is.

Not to nitpick but I wanted to add some westcoast slangterms-

Works/ (out)fits= needles

Chiva/ hop/ black= heroin


Add: Has anyone hear heard or used the term skag ever? Seems archaic but it could be regional. Same with horse actually.

I've only heard skag being used by BL'ers from the UK or, in real life, older Australians. Most youger Australians call it H or smack.

Heroin is diacetylmorphine. Vinegar is acetic acid. As mentioned vinegar would make sense as a byproduct.


However, it could also be that the acetylation process causes a vinegar smell too. I have some bulk acetyl-l-carnitine that smells like vinegar too.


Often , but not always, it can be a good sign IME. Most of the more whitish powder we get here reeks of vinegar and it is good.

#3 can be the same color. You are right that #4 can be found in the UK, but generally, from what Ive read, #3 is most popular in European countries.

New Jersey.. At the dope spot that I would frequent a lot there was an old guy in a wheelchair on the corner saying "I got toys!" to everyone who was there coppin shit. He'd sell you a fresh "toy" for a small price.

This thread will be dedicated to the most basic of heroin related questions asked in Other Drugs. It would be ideal if you (the users) could post your new basic questions in this thread, but if you do make a new thread for it, we will try to have it merged in here.

> #3 heroin is the base form, usually found in Europe, Australia, and pretty much anywhere that is not North and South America. It isnt readily soluble in water, so it can't be IVed in its natural state, but with a little extra work, it can be IVed, but most often it is smoked.

I was not aware most of the H in Australia was base and can't be IV'd without extra work? [According to this report by the Crime Commission](http://www.crimecommission.gov.au/content/publications/iddr_2003_04/05_HEROIN.pdf), #4 is the most commonly found type of H in Oz.

This thread will be dedicated to the most basic of heroin related questions asked in Other Drugs. It would be ideal if you (the users) could post your new basic questions in this thread, but if you do make a new thread for it, we will try to have it merged in here.

> #3 heroin is the base form, usually found in Europe, Australia, and pretty much anywhere that is not North and South America. It isnt readily soluble in water, so it can't be IVed in its natural state, but with a little extra work, it can be IVed, but most often it is smoked.

I was not aware most of the H in Australia was base and can't be IV'd without extra work? [According to this report by the Crime Commission](http://www.crimecommission.gov.au/content/publications/iddr_2003_04/05_HEROIN.pdf), #4 is the most commonly found type of H in Oz.

awesome thread, cant believe this hasn't been done already.


what about with powder(maybe tar as well, never had it in my area) the vinegar smell? ive heard people say that when you have a strong vinegar scent it tends to be stronger quality, and im not sure if this is 100% true, but my experience has backed it up.

i would add that in some cities, like dayton, for example, that it comes in geltabs as well.

Great Thread , Sixpartseven . Theres alot of very useful information in there that I think will really help out first time users . And i would also like to really stress the fact that under any circumstance you should never share a needle with someone. Ive seen alot of people catch tings in that way and it is very hearbreaking for their family . Please be careful everyone and always start low and work ure way up when using this stuff , its very easy to Od if your not opiate tolerant.

I'll edit it to reflect the suggestions youve made. I think to make this thing really good it will take contributions from all of you to fill it up with every last bit of basic info we can think of, so that just like JV said, beginners can find everything they need to know in one spot.


Phrozen or anyone else: In the dangers of IVing section, could you help me out with that. Phrozen, I know you and I have discussed it before, so you know what Im talking about. I just cant remember the names and what each one of them is.

I've only heard skag being used by BL'ers from the UK or, in real life, older Australians. Most youger Australians call it H or smack.

Heroin is diacetylmorphine. Vinegar is acetic acid. As mentioned vinegar would make sense as a byproduct.


However, it could also be that the acetylation process causes a vinegar smell too. I have some bulk acetyl-l-carnitine that smells like vinegar too.


Often , but not always, it can be a good sign IME. Most of the more whitish powder we get here reeks of vinegar and it is good.

#3 can be the same color. You are right that #4 can be found in the UK, but generally, from what Ive read, #3 is most popular in European countries.

New Jersey.. At the dope spot that I would frequent a lot there was an old guy in a wheelchair on the corner saying "I got toys!" to everyone who was there coppin shit. He'd sell you a fresh "toy" for a small price.

Awesome thread 6/7.


Haven't finished reading it all yet but one thing I can throw into the mix is that UK heroin is almost always light brown powder. This is #4 , correct me if I'm wrong?

Heroin is diacetylmorphine. Vinegar is acetic acid. As mentioned vinegar would make sense as a byproduct.


However, it could also be that the acetylation process causes a vinegar smell too. I have some bulk acetyl-l-carnitine that smells like vinegar too.


Often , but not always, it can be a good sign IME. Most of the more whitish powder we get here reeks of vinegar and it is good.

#3 can be the same color. You are right that #4 can be found in the UK, but generally, from what Ive read, #3 is most popular in European countries.

New Jersey.. At the dope spot that I would frequent a lot there was an old guy in a wheelchair on the corner saying "I got toys!" to everyone who was there coppin shit. He'd sell you a fresh "toy" for a small price.

I was not aware most of the H in Australia was base and can't be IV'd without extra work? [According to this report by the Crime Commission](http://www.crimecommission.gov.au/content/publications/iddr_2003_04/05_HEROIN.pdf), #4 is the most commonly found type of H in Oz.

i would add that in some cities, like dayton, for example, that it comes in geltabs as well.

Great Thread , Sixpartseven . Theres alot of very useful information in there that I think will really help out first time users . And i would also like to really stress the fact that under any circumstance you should never share a needle with someone. Ive seen alot of people catch tings in that way and it is very hearbreaking for their family . Please be careful everyone and always start low and work ure way up when using this stuff , its very easy to Od if your not opiate tolerant.

Thanks guys.


I'll edit it to reflect the suggestions youve made. I think to make this thing really good it will take contributions from all of you to fill it up with every last bit of basic info we can think of, so that just like JV said, beginners can find everything they need to know in one spot.


Phrozen or anyone else: In the dangers of IVing section, could you help me out with that. Phrozen, I know you and I have discussed it before, so you know what Im talking about. I just cant remember the names and what each one of them is.

Not to nitpick but I wanted to add some westcoast slangterms-

Works/ (out)fits= needles

Chiva/ hop/ black= heroin


Add: Has anyone hear heard or used the term skag ever? Seems archaic but it could be regional. Same with horse actually.

I've only heard skag being used by BL'ers from the UK or, in real life, older Australians. Most youger Australians call it H or smack.

Thanks guys.


I'll edit it to reflect the suggestions youve made. I think to make this thing really good it will take contributions from all of you to fill it up with every last bit of basic info we can think of, so that just like JV said, beginners can find everything they need to know in one spot.


Phrozen or anyone else: In the dangers of IVing section, could you help me out with that. Phrozen, I know you and I have discussed it before, so you know what Im talking about. I just cant remember the names and what each one of them is.

Not to nitpick but I wanted to add some westcoast slangterms-

Works/ (out)fits= needles

Chiva/ hop/ black= heroin


Add: Has anyone hear heard or used the term skag ever? Seems archaic but it could be regional. Same with horse actually.

I've only heard skag being used by BL'ers from the UK or, in real life, older Australians. Most youger Australians call it H or smack.

Heroin is diacetylmorphine. Vinegar is acetic acid. As mentioned vinegar would make sense as a byproduct.


However, it could also be that the acetylation process causes a vinegar smell too. I have some bulk acetyl-l-carnitine that smells like vinegar too.


Often , but not always, it can be a good sign IME. Most of the more whitish powder we get here reeks of vinegar and it is good.

#3 can be the same color. You are right that #4 can be found in the UK, but generally, from what Ive read, #3 is most popular in European countries.

New Jersey.. At the dope spot that I would frequent a lot there was an old guy in a wheelchair on the corner saying "I got toys!" to everyone who was there coppin shit. He'd sell you a fresh "toy" for a small price.

This thread will be dedicated to the most basic of heroin related questions asked in Other Drugs. It would be ideal if you (the users) could post your new basic questions in this thread, but if you do make a new thread for it, we will try to have it merged in here.

> #3 heroin is the base form, usually found in Europe, Australia, and pretty much anywhere that is not North and South America. It isnt readily soluble in water, so it can't be IVed in its natural state, but with a little extra work, it can be IVed, but most often it is smoked.

I was not aware most of the H in Australia was base and can't be IV'd without extra work? [According to this report by the Crime Commission](http://www.crimecommission.gov.au/content/publications/iddr_2003_04/05_HEROIN.pdf), #4 is the most commonly found type of H in Oz.

Great Thread , Sixpartseven . Theres alot of very useful information in there that I think will really help out first time users . And i would also like to really stress the fact that under any circumstance you should never share a needle with someone. Ive seen alot of people catch tings in that way and it is very hearbreaking for their family . Please be careful everyone and always start low and work ure way up when using this stuff , its very easy to Od if your not opiate tolerant.

This thread will be dedicated to the most basic of heroin related questions asked in Other Drugs. It would be ideal if you (the users) could post your new basic questions in this thread, but if you do make a new thread for it, we will try to have it merged in here.

> #3 heroin is the base form, usually found in Europe, Australia, and pretty much anywhere that is not North and South America. It isnt readily soluble in water, so it can't be IVed in its natural state, but with a little extra work, it can be IVed, but most often it is smoked.

I was not aware most of the H in Australia was base and can't be IV'd without extra work? [According to this report by the Crime Commission](http://www.crimecommission.gov.au/content/publications/iddr_2003_04/05_HEROIN.pdf), #4 is the most commonly found type of H in Oz.

awesome thread, cant believe this hasn't been done already.


what about with powder(maybe tar as well, never had it in my area) the vinegar smell? ive heard people say that when you have a strong vinegar scent it tends to be stronger quality, and im not sure if this is 100% true, but my experience has backed it up.

well done man.  i think a lot of beginners will like that they can come here in OD and get all their questions answered all at once.  


i would add that in some cities, like dayton, for example, that it comes in geltabs as well.

Great Thread , Sixpartseven . Theres alot of very useful information in there that I think will really help out first time users . And i would also like to really stress the fact that under any circumstance you should never share a needle with someone. Ive seen alot of people catch tings in that way and it is very hearbreaking for their family . Please be careful everyone and always start low and work ure way up when using this stuff , its very easy to Od if your not opiate tolerant.

I'll edit it to reflect the suggestions youve made. I think to make this thing really good it will take contributions from all of you to fill it up with every last bit of basic info we can think of, so that just like JV said, beginners can find everything they need to know in one spot.


Phrozen or anyone else: In the dangers of IVing section, could you help me out with that. Phrozen, I know you and I have discussed it before, so you know what Im talking about. I just cant remember the names and what each one of them is.

I've only heard skag being used by BL'ers from the UK or, in real life, older Australians. Most youger Australians call it H or smack.

Heroin is diacetylmorphine. Vinegar is acetic acid. As mentioned vinegar would make sense as a byproduct.


However, it could also be that the acetylation process causes a vinegar smell too. I have some bulk acetyl-l-carnitine that smells like vinegar too.


Often , but not always, it can be a good sign IME. Most of the more whitish powder we get here reeks of vinegar and it is good.

#3 can be the same color. You are right that #4 can be found in the UK, but generally, from what Ive read, #3 is most popular in European countries.

New Jersey.. At the dope spot that I would frequent a lot there was an old guy in a wheelchair on the corner saying "I got toys!" to everyone who was there coppin shit. He'd sell you a fresh "toy" for a small price.

Heroin is diacetylmorphine. Vinegar is acetic acid. As mentioned vinegar would make sense as a byproduct.


However, it could also be that the acetylation process causes a vinegar smell too. I have some bulk acetyl-l-carnitine that smells like vinegar too.


Often , but not always, it can be a good sign IME. Most of the more whitish powder we get here reeks of vinegar and it is good.

New Jersey.. At the dope spot that I would frequent a lot there was an old guy in a wheelchair on the corner saying "I got toys!" to everyone who was there coppin shit. He'd sell you a fresh "toy" for a small price.

I was not aware most of the H in Australia was base and can't be IV'd without extra work? [According to this report by the Crime Commission](http://www.crimecommission.gov.au/content/publications/iddr_2003_04/05_HEROIN.pdf), #4 is the most commonly found type of H in Oz.

Great Thread , Sixpartseven . Theres alot of very useful information in there that I think will really help out first time users . And i would also like to really stress the fact that under any circumstance you should never share a needle with someone. Ive seen alot of people catch tings in that way and it is very hearbreaking for their family . Please be careful everyone and always start low and work ure way up when using this stuff , its very easy to Od if your not opiate tolerant.

I'll edit it to reflect the suggestions youve made. I think to make this thing really good it will take contributions from all of you to fill it up with every last bit of basic info we can think of, so that just like JV said, beginners can find everything they need to know in one spot.


Phrozen or anyone else: In the dangers of IVing section, could you help me out with that. Phrozen, I know you and I have discussed it before, so you know what Im talking about. I just cant remember the names and what each one of them is.

Not to nitpick but I wanted to add some westcoast slangterms-

Works/ (out)fits= needles

Chiva/ hop/ black= heroin


Add: Has anyone hear heard or used the term skag ever? Seems archaic but it could be regional. Same with horse actually.

I've only heard skag being used by BL'ers from the UK or, in real life, older Australians. Most youger Australians call it H or smack.

I'll edit it to reflect the suggestions youve made. I think to make this thing really good it will take contributions from all of you to fill it up with every last bit of basic info we can think of, so that just like JV said, beginners can find everything they need to know in one spot.


Phrozen or anyone else: In the dangers of IVing section, could you help me out with that. Phrozen, I know you and I have discussed it before, so you know what Im talking about. I just cant remember the names and what each one of them is.

Not to nitpick but I wanted to add some westcoast slangterms-

Works/ (out)fits= needles

Chiva/ hop/ black= heroin


Add: Has anyone hear heard or used the term skag ever? Seems archaic but it could be regional. Same with horse actually.

I've only heard skag being used by BL'ers from the UK or, in real life, older Australians. Most youger Australians call it H or smack.

Heroin is diacetylmorphine. Vinegar is acetic acid. As mentioned vinegar would make sense as a byproduct.


However, it could also be that the acetylation process causes a vinegar smell too. I have some bulk acetyl-l-carnitine that smells like vinegar too.


Often , but not always, it can be a good sign IME. Most of the more whitish powder we get here reeks of vinegar and it is good.

> #3 heroin is the base form, usually found in Europe, Australia, and pretty much anywhere that is not North and South America. It isnt readily soluble in water, so it can't be IVed in its natural state, but with a little extra work, it can be IVed, but most often it is smoked.

I was not aware most of the H in Australia was base and can't be IV'd without extra work? [According to this report by the Crime Commission](http://www.crimecommission.gov.au/content/publications/iddr_2003_04/05_HEROIN.pdf), #4 is the most commonly found type of H in Oz.

Great Thread , Sixpartseven . Theres alot of very useful information in there that I think will really help out first time users . And i would also like to really stress the fact that under any circumstance you should never share a needle with someone. Ive seen alot of people catch tings in that way and it is very hearbreaking for their family . Please be careful everyone and always start low and work ure way up when using this stuff , its very easy to Od if your not opiate tolerant.

> #3 heroin is the base form, usually found in Europe, Australia, and pretty much anywhere that is not North and South America. It isnt readily soluble in water, so it can't be IVed in its natural state, but with a little extra work, it can be IVed, but most often it is smoked.

I was not aware most of the H in Australia was base and can't be IV'd without extra work? [According to this report by the Crime Commission](http://www.crimecommission.gov.au/content/publications/iddr_2003_04/05_HEROIN.pdf), #4 is the most commonly found type of H in Oz.

awesome thread, cant believe this hasn't been done already.


what about with powder(maybe tar as well, never had it in my area) the vinegar smell? ive heard people say that when you have a strong vinegar scent it tends to be stronger quality, and im not sure if this is 100% true, but my experience has backed it up.

well done man.  i think a lot of beginners will like that they can come here in OD and get all their questions answered all at once.  


i would add that in some cities, like dayton, for example, that it comes in geltabs as well.

Great Thread , Sixpartseven . Theres alot of very useful information in there that I think will really help out first time users . And i would also like to really stress the fact that under any circumstance you should never share a needle with someone. Ive seen alot of people catch tings in that way and it is very hearbreaking for their family . Please be careful everyone and always start low and work ure way up when using this stuff , its very easy to Od if your not opiate tolerant.

I'll edit it to reflect the suggestions youve made. I think to make this thing really good it will take contributions from all of you to fill it up with every last bit of basic info we can think of, so that just like JV said, beginners can find everything they need to know in one spot.


Phrozen or anyone else: In the dangers of IVing section, could you help me out with that. Phrozen, I know you and I have discussed it before, so you know what Im talking about. I just cant remember the names and what each one of them is.

I've only heard skag being used by BL'ers from the UK or, in real life, older Australians. Most youger Australians call it H or smack.

Heroin is diacetylmorphine. Vinegar is acetic acid. As mentioned vinegar would make sense as a byproduct.


However, it could also be that the acetylation process causes a vinegar smell too. I have some bulk acetyl-l-carnitine that smells like vinegar too.


Often , but not always, it can be a good sign IME. Most of the more whitish powder we get here reeks of vinegar and it is good.

#3 can be the same color. You are right that #4 can be found in the UK, but generally, from what Ive read, #3 is most popular in European countries.

New Jersey.. At the dope spot that I would frequent a lot there was an old guy in a wheelchair on the corner saying "I got toys!" to everyone who was there coppin shit. He'd sell you a fresh "toy" for a small price.

Heroin is diacetylmorphine. Vinegar is acetic acid. As mentioned vinegar would make sense as a byproduct.


However, it could also be that the acetylation process causes a vinegar smell too. I have some bulk acetyl-l-carnitine that smells like vinegar too.


Often , but not always, it can be a good sign IME. Most of the more whitish powder we get here reeks of vinegar and it is good.

New Jersey.. At the dope spot that I would frequent a lot there was an old guy in a wheelchair on the corner saying "I got toys!" to everyone who was there coppin shit. He'd sell you a fresh "toy" for a small price.

I was not aware most of the H in Australia was base and can't be IV'd without extra work? [According to this report by the Crime Commission](http://www.crimecommission.gov.au/content/publications/iddr_2003_04/05_HEROIN.pdf), #4 is the most commonly found type of H in Oz.

Great Thread , Sixpartseven . Theres alot of very useful information in there that I think will really help out first time users . And i would also like to really stress the fact that under any circumstance you should never share a needle with someone. Ive seen alot of people catch tings in that way and it is very hearbreaking for their family . Please be careful everyone and always start low and work ure way up when using this stuff , its very easy to Od if your not opiate tolerant.

I'll edit it to reflect the suggestions youve made. I think to make this thing really good it will take contributions from all of you to fill it up with every last bit of basic info we can think of, so that just like JV said, beginners can find everything they need to know in one spot.


Phrozen or anyone else: In the dangers of IVing section, could you help me out with that. Phrozen, I know you and I have discussed it before, so you know what Im talking about. I just cant remember the names and what each one of them is.

Not to nitpick but I wanted to add some westcoast slangterms-

Works/ (out)fits= needles

Chiva/ hop/ black= heroin


Add: Has anyone hear heard or used the term skag ever? Seems archaic but it could be regional. Same with horse actually.

I've only heard skag being used by BL'ers from the UK or, in real life, older Australians. Most youger Australians call it H or smack.

I'll edit it to reflect the suggestions youve made. I think to make this thing really good it will take contributions from all of you to fill it up with every last bit of basic info we can think of, so that just like JV said, beginners can find everything they need to know in one spot.


Phrozen or anyone else: In the dangers of IVing section, could you help me out with that. Phrozen, I know you and I have discussed it before, so you know what Im talking about. I just cant remember the names and what each one of them is.

Not to nitpick but I wanted to add some westcoast slangterms-

Works/ (out)fits= needles

Chiva/ hop/ black= heroin


Add: Has anyone hear heard or used the term skag ever? Seems archaic but it could be regional. Same with horse actually.

I've only heard skag being used by BL'ers from the UK or, in real life, older Australians. Most youger Australians call it H or smack.

Heroin is diacetylmorphine. Vinegar is acetic acid. As mentioned vinegar would make sense as a byproduct.


However, it could also be that the acetylation process causes a vinegar smell too. I have some bulk acetyl-l-carnitine that smells like vinegar too.


Often , but not always, it can be a good sign IME. Most of the more whitish powder we get here reeks of vinegar and it is good.

> #3 heroin is the base form, usually found in Europe, Australia, and pretty much anywhere that is not North and South America. It isnt readily soluble in water, so it can't be IVed in its natural state, but with a little extra work, it can be IVed, but most often it is smoked.

I was not aware most of the H in Australia was base and can't be IV'd without extra work? [According to this report by the Crime Commission](http://www.crimecommission.gov.au/content/publications/iddr_2003_04/05_HEROIN.pdf), #4 is the most commonly found type of H in Oz.

Great Thread , Sixpartseven . Theres alot of very useful information in there that I think will really help out first time users . And i would also like to really stress the fact that under any circumstance you should never share a needle with someone. Ive seen alot of people catch tings in that way and it is very hearbreaking for their family . Please be careful everyone and always start low and work ure way up when using this stuff , its very easy to Od if your not opiate tolerant.

> #3 heroin is the base form, usually found in Europe, Australia, and pretty much anywhere that is not North and South America. It isnt readily soluble in water, so it can't be IVed in its natural state, but with a little extra work, it can be IVed, but most often it is smoked.

I was not aware most of the H in Australia was base and can't be IV'd without extra work? [According to this report by the Crime Commission](http://www.crimecommission.gov.au/content/publications/iddr_2003_04/05_HEROIN.pdf), #4 is the most commonly found type of H in Oz.

awesome thread, cant believe this hasn't been done already.


what about with powder(maybe tar as well, never had it in my area) the vinegar smell? ive heard people say that when you have a strong vinegar scent it tends to be stronger quality, and im not sure if this is 100% true, but my experience has backed it up.

well done man.  i think a lot of beginners will like that they can come here in OD and get all their questions answered all at once.  


i would add that in some cities, like dayton, for example, that it comes in geltabs as well.

Great Thread , Sixpartseven . Theres alot of very useful information in there that I think will really help out first time users . And i would also like to really stress the fact that under any circumstance you should never share a needle with someone. Ive seen alot of people catch tings in that way and it is very hearbreaking for their family . Please be careful everyone and always start low and work ure way up when using this stuff , its very easy to Od if your not opiate tolerant.

I'll edit it to reflect the suggestions youve made. I think to make this thing really good it will take contributions from all of you to fill it up with every last bit of basic info we can think of, so that just like JV said, beginners can find everything they need to know in one spot.


Phrozen or anyone else: In the dangers of IVing section, could you help me out with that. Phrozen, I know you and I have discussed it before, so you know what Im talking about. I just cant remember the names and what each one of them is.

I've only heard skag being used by BL'ers from the UK or, in real life, older Australians. Most youger Australians call it H or smack.

Heroin is diacetylmorphine. Vinegar is acetic acid. As mentioned vinegar would make sense as a byproduct.


However, it could also be that the acetylation process causes a vinegar smell too. I have some bulk acetyl-l-carnitine that smells like vinegar too.


Often , but not always, it can be a good sign IME. Most of the more whitish powder we get here reeks of vinegar and it is good.

#3 can be the same color. You are right that #4 can be found in the UK, but generally, from what Ive read, #3 is most popular in European countries.

New Jersey.. At the dope spot that I would frequent a lot there was an old guy in a wheelchair on the corner saying "I got toys!" to everyone who was there coppin shit. He'd sell you a fresh "toy" for a small price.

Heroin is diacetylmorphine. Vinegar is acetic acid. As mentioned vinegar would make sense as a byproduct.


However, it could also be that the acetylation process causes a vinegar smell too. I have some bulk acetyl-l-carnitine that smells like vinegar too.


Often , but not always, it can be a good sign IME. Most of the more whitish powder we get here reeks of vinegar and it is good.

New Jersey.. At the dope spot that I would frequent a lot there was an old guy in a wheelchair on the corner saying "I got toys!" to everyone who was there coppin shit. He'd sell you a fresh "toy" for a small price.

I was not aware most of the H in Australia was base and can't be IV'd without extra work? [According to this report by the Crime Commission](http://www.crimecommission.gov.au/content/publications/iddr_2003_04/05_HEROIN.pdf), #4 is the most commonly found type of H in Oz.

Great Thread , Sixpartseven . Theres alot of very useful information in there that I think will really help out first time users . And i would also like to really stress the fact that under any circumstance you should never share a needle with someone. Ive seen alot of people catch tings in that way and it is very hearbreaking for their family . Please be careful everyone and always start low and work ure way up when using this stuff , its very easy to Od if your not opiate tolerant.

I'll edit it to reflect the suggestions youve made. I think to make this thing really good it will take contributions from all of you to fill it up with every last bit of basic info we can think of, so that just like JV said, beginners can find everything they need to know in one spot.


Phrozen or anyone else: In the dangers of IVing section, could you help me out with that. Phrozen, I know you and I have discussed it before, so you know what Im talking about. I just cant remember the names and what each one of them is.

Not to nitpick but I wanted to add some westcoast slangterms-

Works/ (out)fits= needles

Chiva/ hop/ black= heroin


Add: Has anyone hear heard or used the term skag ever? Seems archaic but it could be regional. Same with horse actually.

I've only heard skag being used by BL'ers from the UK or, in real life, older Australians. Most youger Australians call it H or smack.

I'll edit it to reflect the suggestions youve made. I think to make this thing really good it will take contributions from all of you to fill it up with every last bit of basic info we can think of, so that just like JV said, beginners can find everything they need to know in one spot.


Phrozen or anyone else: In the dangers of IVing section, could you help me out with that. Phrozen, I know you and I have discussed it before, so you know what Im talking about. I just cant remember the names and what each one of them is.

Not to nitpick but I wanted to add some westcoast slangterms-

Works/ (out)fits= needles

Chiva/ hop/ black= heroin


Add: Has anyone hear heard or used the term skag ever? Seems archaic but it could be regional. Same with horse actually.

I've only heard skag being used by BL'ers from the UK or, in real life, older Australians. Most youger Australians call it H or smack.

Heroin is diacetylmorphine. Vinegar is acetic acid. As mentioned vinegar would make sense as a byproduct.


However, it could also be that the acetylation process causes a vinegar smell too. I have some bulk acetyl-l-carnitine that smells like vinegar too.


Often , but not always, it can be a good sign IME. Most of the more whitish powder we get here reeks of vinegar and it is good.

> #3 heroin is the base form, usually found in Europe, Australia, and pretty much anywhere that is not North and South America. It isnt readily soluble in water, so it can't be IVed in its natural state, but with a little extra work, it can be IVed, but most often it is smoked.

I was not aware most of the H in Australia was base and can't be IV'd without extra work? [According to this report by the Crime Commission](http://www.crimecommission.gov.au/content/publications/iddr_2003_04/05_HEROIN.pdf), #4 is the most commonly found type of H in Oz.

Great Thread , Sixpartseven . Theres alot of very useful information in there that I think will really help out first time users . And i would also like to really stress the fact that under any circumstance you should never share a needle with someone. Ive seen alot of people catch tings in that way and it is very hearbreaking for their family . Please be careful everyone and always start low and work ure way up when using this stuff , its very easy to Od if your not opiate tolerant.

> #3 heroin is the base form, usually found in Europe, Australia, and pretty much anywhere that is not North and South America. It isnt readily soluble in water, so it can't be IVed in its natural state, but with a little extra work, it can be IVed, but most often it is smoked.

I was not aware most of the H in Australia was base and can't be IV'd without extra work? [According to this report by the Crime Commission](http://www.crimecommission.gov.au/content/publications/iddr_2003_04/05_HEROIN.pdf), #4 is the most commonly found type of H in Oz.

awesome thread, cant believe this hasn't been done already.


what about with powder(maybe tar as well, never had it in my area) the vinegar smell? ive heard people say that when you have a strong vinegar scent it tends to be stronger quality, and im not sure if this is 100% true, but my experience has backed it up.

well done man.  i think a lot of beginners will like that they can come here in OD and get all their questions answered all at once.  


i would add that in some cities, like dayton, for example, that it comes in geltabs as well.

Great Thread , Sixpartseven . Theres alot of very useful information in there that I think will really help out first time users . And i would also like to really stress the fact that under any circumstance you should never share a needle with someone. Ive seen alot of people catch tings in that way and it is very hearbreaking for their family . Please be careful everyone and always start low and work ure way up when using this stuff , its very easy to Od if your not opiate tolerant.

I'll edit it to reflect the suggestions youve made. I think to make this thing really good it will take contributions from all of you to fill it up with every last bit of basic info we can think of, so that just like JV said, beginners can find everything they need to know in one spot.


Phrozen or anyone else: In the dangers of IVing section, could you help me out with that. Phrozen, I know you and I have discussed it before, so you know what Im talking about. I just cant remember the names and what each one of them is.

I've only heard skag being used by BL'ers from the UK or, in real life, older Australians. Most youger Australians call it H or smack.

Heroin is diacetylmorphine. Vinegar is acetic acid. As mentioned vinegar would make sense as a byproduct.


However, it could also be that the acetylation process causes a vinegar smell too. I have some bulk acetyl-l-carnitine that smells like vinegar too.


Often , but not always, it can be a good sign IME. Most of the more whitish powder we get here reeks of vinegar and it is good.

#3 can be the same color. You are right that #4 can be found in the UK, but generally, from what Ive read, #3 is most popular in European countries.

New Jersey.. At the dope spot that I would frequent a lot there was an old guy in a wheelchair on the corner saying "I got toys!" to everyone who was there coppin shit. He'd sell you a fresh "toy" for a small price.

Heroin is diacetylmorphine. Vinegar is acetic acid. As mentioned vinegar would make sense as a byproduct.


However, it could also be that the acetylation process causes a vinegar smell too. I have some bulk acetyl-l-carnitine that smells like vinegar too.


Often , but not always, it can be a good sign IME. Most of the more whitish powder we get here reeks of vinegar and it is good.

New Jersey.. At the dope spot that I would frequent a lot there was an old guy in a wheelchair on the corner saying "I got toys!" to everyone who was there coppin shit. He'd sell you a fresh "toy" for a small price.

I was not aware most of the H in Australia was base and can't be IV'd without extra work? [According to this report by the Crime Commission](http://www.crimecommission.gov.au/content/publications/iddr_2003_04/05_HEROIN.pdf), #4 is the most commonly found type of H in Oz.

Great Thread , Sixpartseven . Theres alot of very useful information in there that I think will really help out first time users . And i would also like to really stress the fact that under any circumstance you should never share a needle with someone. Ive seen alot of people catch tings in that way and it is very hearbreaking for their family . Please be careful everyone and always start low and work ure way up when using this stuff , its very easy to Od if your not opiate tolerant.

I'll edit it to reflect the suggestions youve made. I think to make this thing really good it will take contributions from all of you to fill it up with every last bit of basic info we can think of, so that just like JV said, beginners can find everything they need to know in one spot.


Phrozen or anyone else: In the dangers of IVing section, could you help me out with that. Phrozen, I know you and I have discussed it before, so you know what Im talking about. I just cant remember the names and what each one of them is.

Not to nitpick but I wanted to add some westcoast slangterms-

Works/ (out)fits= needles

Chiva/ hop/ black= heroin


Add: Has anyone hear heard or used the term skag ever? Seems archaic but it could be regional. Same with horse actually.

I've only heard skag being used by BL'ers from the UK or, in real life, older Australians. Most youger Australians call it H or smack.

I'll edit it to reflect the suggestions youve made. I think to make this thing really good it will take contributions from all of you to fill it up with every last bit of basic info we can think of, so that just like JV said, beginners can find everything they need to know in one spot.


Phrozen or anyone else: In the dangers of IVing section, could you help me out with that. Phrozen, I know you and I have discussed it before, so you know what Im talking about. I just cant remember the names and what each one of them is.

Not to nitpick but I wanted to add some westcoast slangterms-

Works/ (out)fits= needles

Chiva/ hop/ black= heroin


Add: Has anyone hear heard or used the term skag ever? Seems archaic but it could be regional. Same with horse actually.

I've only heard skag being used by BL'ers from the UK or, in real life, older Australians. Most youger Australians call it H or smack.

Heroin is diacetylmorphine. Vinegar is acetic acid. As mentioned vinegar would make sense as a byproduct.


However, it could also be that the acetylation process causes a vinegar smell too. I have some bulk acetyl-l-carnitine that smells like vinegar too.


Often , but not always, it can be a good sign IME. Most of the more whitish powder we get here reeks of vinegar and it is good.

> #3 heroin is the base form, usually found in Europe, Australia, and pretty much anywhere that is not North and South America. It isnt readily soluble in water, so it can't be IVed in its natural state, but with a little extra work, it can be IVed, but most often it is smoked.

I was not aware most of the H in Australia was base and can't be IV'd without extra work? [According to this report by the Crime Commission](http://www.crimecommission.gov.au/content/publications/iddr_2003_04/05_HEROIN.pdf), #4 is the most commonly found type of H in Oz.

Great Thread , Sixpartseven . Theres alot of very useful information in there that I think will really help out first time users . And i would also like to really stress the fact that under any circumstance you should never share a needle with someone. Ive seen alot of people catch tings in that way and it is very hearbreaking for their family . Please be careful everyone and always start low and work ure way up when using this stuff , its very easy to Od if your not opiate tolerant.

> #3 heroin is the base form, usually found in Europe, Australia, and pretty much anywhere that is not North and South America. It isnt readily soluble in water, so it can't be IVed in its natural state, but with a little extra work, it can be IVed, but most often it is smoked.

I was not aware most of the H in Australia was base and can't be IV'd without extra work? [According to this report by the Crime Commission](http://www.crimecommission.gov.au/content/publications/iddr_2003_04/05_HEROIN.pdf), #4 is the most commonly found type of H in Oz.

awesome thread, cant believe this hasn't been done already.


what about with powder(maybe tar as well, never had it in my area) the vinegar smell? ive heard people say that when you have a strong vinegar scent it tends to be stronger quality, and im not sure if this is 100% true, but my experience has backed it up.

well done man.  i think a lot of beginners will like that they can come here in OD and get all their questions answered all at once.  


i would add that in some cities, like dayton, for example, that it comes in geltabs as well.

Great Thread , Sixpartseven . Theres alot of very useful information in there that I think will really help out first time users . And i would also like to really stress the fact that under any circumstance you should never share a needle with someone. Ive seen alot of people catch tings in that way and it is very hearbreaking for their family . Please be careful everyone and always start low and work ure way up when using this stuff , its very easy to Od if your not opiate tolerant.

I'll edit it to reflect the suggestions youve made. I think to make this thing really good it will take contributions from all of you to fill it up with every last bit of basic info we can think of, so that just like JV said, beginners can find everything they need to know in one spot.


Phrozen or anyone else: In the dangers of IVing section, could you help me out with that. Phrozen, I know you and I have discussed it before, so you know what Im talking about. I just cant remember the names and what each one of them is.

I've only heard skag being used by BL'ers from the UK or, in real life, older Australians. Most youger Australians call it H or smack.

Heroin is diacetylmorphine. Vinegar is acetic acid. As mentioned vinegar would make sense as a byproduct.


However, it could also be that the acetylation process causes a vinegar smell too. I have some bulk acetyl-l-carnitine that smells like vinegar too.


Often , but not always, it can be a good sign IME. Most of the more whitish powder we get here reeks of vinegar and it is good.

#3 can be the same color. You are right that #4 can be found in the UK, but generally, from what Ive read, #3 is most popular in European countries.

New Jersey.. At the dope spot that I would frequent a lot there was an old guy in a wheelchair on the corner saying "I got toys!" to everyone who was there coppin shit. He'd sell you a fresh "toy" for a small price.

Heroin is diacetylmorphine. Vinegar is acetic acid. As mentioned vinegar would make sense as a byproduct.


However, it could also be that the acetylation process causes a vinegar smell too. I have some bulk acetyl-l-carnitine that smells like vinegar too.


Often , but not always, it can be a good sign IME. Most of the more whitish powder we get here reeks of vinegar and it is good.

New Jersey.. At the dope spot that I would frequent a lot there was an old guy in a wheelchair on the corner saying "I got toys!" to everyone who was there coppin shit. He'd sell you a fresh "toy" for a small price.

I was not aware most of the H in Australia was base and can't be IV'd without extra work? [According to this report by the Crime Commission](http://www.crimecommission.gov.au/content/publications/iddr_2003_04/05_HEROIN.pdf), #4 is the most commonly found type of H in Oz.

Great Thread , Sixpartseven . Theres alot of very useful information in there that I think will really help out first time users . And i would also like to really stress the fact that under any circumstance you should never share a needle with someone. Ive seen alot of people catch tings in that way and it is very hearbreaking for their family . Please be careful everyone and always start low and work ure way up when using this stuff , its very easy to Od if your not opiate tolerant.

I'll edit it to reflect the suggestions youve made. I think to make this thing really good it will take contributions from all of you to fill it up with every last bit of basic info we can think of, so that just like JV said, beginners can find everything they need to know in one spot.


Phrozen or anyone else: In the dangers of IVing section, could you help me out with that. Phrozen, I know you and I have discussed it before, so you know what Im talking about. I just cant remember the names and what each one of them is.

Not to nitpick but I wanted to add some westcoast slangterms-

Works/ (out)fits= needles

Chiva/ hop/ black= heroin


Add: Has anyone hear heard or used the term skag ever? Seems archaic but it could be regional. Same with horse actually.

I've only heard skag being used by BL'ers from the UK or, in real life, older Australians. Most youger Australians call it H or smack.

I'll edit it to reflect the suggestions youve made. I think to make this thing really good it will take contributions from all of you to fill it up with every last bit of basic info we can think of, so that just like JV said, beginners can find everything they need to know in one spot.


Phrozen or anyone else: In the dangers of IVing section, could you help me out with that. Phrozen, I know you and I have discussed it before, so you know what Im talking about. I just cant remember the names and what each one of them is.

Not to nitpick but I wanted to add some westcoast slangterms-

Works/ (out)fits= needles

Chiva/ hop/ black= heroin


Add: Has anyone hear heard or used the term skag ever? Seems archaic but it could be regional. Same with horse actually.

I've only heard skag being used by BL'ers from the UK or, in real life, older Australians. Most youger Australians call it H or smack.

Heroin is diacetylmorphine. Vinegar is acetic acid. As mentioned vinegar would make sense as a byproduct.


However, it could also be that the acetylation process causes a vinegar smell too. I have some bulk acetyl-l-carnitine that smells like vinegar too.


Often , but not always, it can be a good sign IME. Most of the more whitish powder we get here reeks of vinegar and it is good.

> #3 heroin is the base form, usually found in Europe, Australia, and pretty much anywhere that is not North and South America. It isnt readily soluble in water, so it can't be IVed in its natural state, but with a little extra work, it can be IVed, but most often it is smoked.

I was not aware most of the H in Australia was base and can't be IV'd without extra work? [According to this report by the Crime Commission](http://www.crimecommission.gov.au/content/publications/iddr_2003_04/05_HEROIN.pdf), #4 is the most commonly found type of H in Oz.

Great Thread , Sixpartseven . Theres alot of very useful information in there that I think will really help out first time users . And i would also like to really stress the fact that under any circumstance you should never share a needle with someone. Ive seen alot of people catch tings in that way and it is very hearbreaking for their family . Please be careful everyone and always start low and work ure way up when using this stuff , its very easy to Od if your not opiate tolerant.

> #3 heroin is the base form, usually found in Europe, Australia, and pretty much anywhere that is not North and South America. It isnt readily soluble in water, so it can't be IVed in its natural state, but with a little extra work, it can be IVed, but most often it is smoked.

I was not aware most of the H in Australia was base and can't be IV'd without extra work? [According to this report by the Crime Commission](http://www.crimecommission.gov.au/content/publications/iddr_2003_04/05_HEROIN.pdf), #4 is the most commonly found type of H in Oz.

awesome thread, cant believe this hasn't been done already.


what about with powder(maybe tar as well, never had it in my area) the vinegar smell? ive heard people say that when you have a strong vinegar scent it tends to be stronger quality, and im not sure if this is 100% true, but my experience has backed it up.

well done man.  i think a lot of beginners will like that they can come here in OD and get all their questions answered all at once.  


i would add that in some cities, like dayton, for example, that it comes in geltabs as well.

Great Thread , Sixpartseven . Theres alot of very useful information in there that I think will really help out first time users . And i would also like to really stress the fact that under any circumstance you should never share a needle with someone. Ive seen alot of people catch tings in that way and it is very hearbreaking for their family . Please be careful everyone and always start low and work ure way up when using this stuff , its very easy to Od if your not opiate tolerant.

I'll edit it to reflect the suggestions youve made. I think to make this thing really good it will take contributions from all of you to fill it up with every last bit of basic info we can think of, so that just like JV said, beginners can find everything they need to know in one spot.


Phrozen or anyone else: In the dangers of IVing section, could you help me out with that. Phrozen, I know you and I have discussed it before, so you know what Im talking about. I just cant remember the names and what each one of them is.

I've only heard skag being used by BL'ers from the UK or, in real life, older Australians. Most youger Australians call it H or smack.

Heroin is diacetylmorphine. Vinegar is acetic acid. As mentioned vinegar would make sense as a byproduct.


However, it could also be that the acetylation process causes a vinegar smell too. I have some bulk acetyl-l-carnitine that smells like vinegar too.


Often , but not always, it can be a good sign IME. Most of the more whitish powder we get here reeks of vinegar and it is good.

#3 can be the same color. You are right that #4 can be found in the UK, but generally, from what Ive read, #3 is most popular in European countries.

New Jersey.. At the dope spot that I would frequent a lot there was an old guy in a wheelchair on the corner saying "I got toys!" to everyone who was there coppin shit. He'd sell you a fresh "toy" for a small price.

Heroin is diacetylmorphine. Vinegar is acetic acid. As mentioned vinegar would make sense as a byproduct.


However, it could also be that the acetylation process causes a vinegar smell too. I have some bulk acetyl-l-carnitine that smells like vinegar too.


Often , but not always, it can be a good sign IME. Most of the more whitish powder we get here reeks of vinegar and it is good.

New Jersey.. At the dope spot that I would frequent a lot there was an old guy in a wheelchair on the corner saying "I got toys!" to everyone who was there coppin shit. He'd sell you a fresh "toy" for a small price.

I was not aware most of the H in Australia was base and can't be IV'd without extra work? [According to this report by the Crime Commission](http://www.crimecommission.gov.au/content/publications/iddr_2003_04/05_HEROIN.pdf), #4 is the most commonly found type of H in Oz.

Great Thread , Sixpartseven . Theres alot of very useful information in there that I think will really help out first time users . And i would also like to really stress the fact that under any circumstance you should never share a needle with someone. Ive seen alot of people catch tings in that way and it is very hearbreaking for their family . Please be careful everyone and always start low and work ure way up when using this stuff , its very easy to Od if your not opiate tolerant.

I'll edit it to reflect the suggestions youve made. I think to make this thing really good it will take contributions from all of you to fill it up with every last bit of basic info we can think of, so that just like JV said, beginners can find everything they need to know in one spot.


Phrozen or anyone else: In the dangers of IVing section, could you help me out with that. Phrozen, I know you and I have discussed it before, so you know what Im talking about. I just cant remember the names and what each one of them is.

Not to nitpick but I wanted to add some westcoast slangterms-

Works/ (out)fits= needles

Chiva/ hop/ black= heroin


Add: Has anyone hear heard or used the term skag ever? Seems archaic but it could be regional. Same with horse actually.

I've only heard skag being used by BL'ers from the UK or, in real life, older Australians. Most youger Australians call it H or smack.

I'll edit it to reflect the suggestions youve made. I think to make this thing really good it will take contributions from all of you to fill it up with every last bit of basic info we can think of, so that just like JV said, beginners can find everything they need to know in one spot.


Phrozen or anyone else: In the dangers of IVing section, could you help me out with that. Phrozen, I know you and I have discussed it before, so you know what Im talking about. I just cant remember the names and what each one of them is.

Not to nitpick but I wanted to add some westcoast slangterms-

Works/ (out)fits= needles

Chiva/ hop/ black= heroin


Add: Has anyone hear heard or used the term skag ever? Seems archaic but it could be regional. Same with horse actually.

I've only heard skag being used by BL'ers from the UK or, in real life, older Australians. Most youger Australians call it H or smack.

Heroin is diacetylmorphine. Vinegar is acetic acid. As mentioned vinegar would make sense as a byproduct.


However, it could also be that the acetylation process causes a vinegar smell too. I have some bulk acetyl-l-carnitine that smells like vinegar too.


Often , but not always, it can be a good sign IME. Most of the more whitish powder we get here reeks of vinegar and it is good.

> #3 heroin is the base form, usually found in Europe, Australia, and pretty much anywhere that is not North and South America. It isnt readily soluble in water, so it can't be IVed in its natural state, but with a little extra work, it can be IVed, but most often it is smoked.

I was not aware most of the H in Australia was base and can't be IV'd without extra work? [According to this report by the Crime Commission](http://www.crimecommission.gov.au/content/publications/iddr_2003_04/05_HEROIN.pdf), #4 is the most commonly found type of H in Oz.

Great Thread , Sixpartseven . Theres alot of very useful information in there that I think will really help out first time users . And i would also like to really stress the fact that under any circumstance you should never share a needle with someone. Ive seen alot of people catch tings in that way and it is very hearbreaking for their family . Please be careful everyone and always start low and work ure way up when using this stuff , its very easy to Od if your not opiate tolerant.

> #3 heroin is the base form, usually found in Europe, Australia, and pretty much anywhere that is not North and South America. It isnt readily soluble in water, so it can't be IVed in its natural state, but with a little extra work, it can be IVed, but most often it is smoked.

I was not aware most of the H in Australia was base and can't be IV'd without extra work? [According to this report by the Crime Commission](http://www.crimecommission.gov.au/content/publications/iddr_2003_04/05_HEROIN.pdf), #4 is the most commonly found type of H in Oz.

awesome thread, cant believe this hasn't been done already.


what about with powder(maybe tar as well, never had it in my area) the vinegar smell? ive heard people say that when you have a strong vinegar scent it tends to be stronger quality, and im not sure if this is 100% true, but my experience has backed it up.

well done man.  i think a lot of beginners will like that they can come here in OD and get all their questions answered all at once.  


i would add that in some cities, like dayton, for example, that it comes in geltabs as well.

Great Thread , Sixpartseven . Theres alot of very useful information in there that I think will really help out first time users . And i would also like to really stress the fact that under any circumstance you should never share a needle with someone. Ive seen alot of people catch tings in that way and it is very hearbreaking for their family . Please be careful everyone and always start low and work ure way up when using this stuff , its very easy to Od if your not opiate tolerant.

I'll edit it to reflect the suggestions youve made. I think to make this thing really good it will take contributions from all of you to fill it up with every last bit of basic info we can think of, so that just like JV said, beginners can find everything they need to know in one spot.


Phrozen or anyone else: In the dangers of IVing section, could you help me out with that. Phrozen, I know you and I have discussed it before, so you know what Im talking about. I just cant remember the names and what each one of them is.

I've only heard skag being used by BL'ers from the UK or, in real life, older Australians. Most youger Australians call it H or smack.

Heroin is diacetylmorphine. Vinegar is acetic acid. As mentioned vinegar would make sense as a byproduct.


However, it could also be that the acetylation process causes a vinegar smell too. I have some bulk acetyl-l-carnitine that smells like vinegar too.


Often , but not always, it can be a good sign IME. Most of the more whitish powder we get here reeks of vinegar and it is good.

#3 can be the same color. You are right that #4 can be found in the UK, but generally, from what Ive read, #3 is most popular in European countries.

New Jersey.. At the dope spot that I would frequent a lot there was an old guy in a wheelchair on the corner saying "I got toys!" to everyone who was there coppin shit. He'd sell you a fresh "toy" for a small price.

Heroin is diacetylmorphine. Vinegar is acetic acid. As mentioned vinegar would make sense as a byproduct.


However, it could also be that the acetylation process causes a vinegar smell too. I have some bulk acetyl-l-carnitine that smells like vinegar too.


Often , but not always, it can be a good sign IME. Most of the more whitish powder we get here reeks of vinegar and it is good.

New Jersey.. At the dope spot that I would frequent a lot there was an old guy in a wheelchair on the corner saying "I got toys!" to everyone who was there coppin shit. He'd sell you a fresh "toy" for a small price.

I was not aware most of the H in Australia was base and can't be IV'd without extra work? [According to this report by the Crime Commission](http://www.crimecommission.gov.au/content/publications/iddr_2003_04/05_HEROIN.pdf), #4 is the most commonly found type of H in Oz.

Great Thread , Sixpartseven . Theres alot of very useful information in there that I think will really help out first time users . And i would also like to really stress the fact that under any circumstance you should never share a needle with someone. Ive seen alot of people catch tings in that way and it is very hearbreaking for their family . Please be careful everyone and always start low and work ure way up when using this stuff , its very easy to Od if your not opiate tolerant.

I'll edit it to reflect the suggestions youve made. I think to make this thing really good it will take contributions from all of you to fill it up with every last bit of basic info we can think of, so that just like JV said, beginners can find everything they need to know in one spot.


Phrozen or anyone else: In the dangers of IVing section, could you help me out with that. Phrozen, I know you and I have discussed it before, so you know what Im talking about. I just cant remember the names and what each one of them is.

Not to nitpick but I wanted to add some westcoast slangterms-

Works/ (out)fits= needles

Chiva/ hop/ black= heroin


Add: Has anyone hear heard or used the term skag ever? Seems archaic but it could be regional. Same with horse actually.

I've only heard skag being used by BL'ers from the UK or, in real life, older Australians. Most youger Australians call it H or smack.

I'll edit it to reflect the suggestions youve made. I think to make this thing really good it will take contributions from all of you to fill it up with every last bit of basic info we can think of, so that just like JV said, beginners can find everything they need to know in one spot.


Phrozen or anyone else: In the dangers of IVing section, could you help me out with that. Phrozen, I know you and I have discussed it before, so you know what Im talking about. I just cant remember the names and what each one of them is.

Not to nitpick but I wanted to add some westcoast slangterms-

Works/ (out)fits= needles

Chiva/ hop/ black= heroin


Add: Has anyone hear heard or used the term skag ever? Seems archaic but it could be regional. Same with horse actually.

I've only heard skag being used by BL'ers from the UK or, in real life, older Australians. Most youger Australians call it H or smack.

Heroin is diacetylmorphine. Vinegar is acetic acid. As mentioned vinegar would make sense as a byproduct.


However, it could also be that the acetylation process causes a vinegar smell too. I have some bulk acetyl-l-carnitine that smells like vinegar too.


Often , but not always, it can be a good sign IME. Most of the more whitish powder we get here reeks of vinegar and it is good.

> #3 heroin is the base form, usually found in Europe, Australia, and pretty much anywhere that is not North and South America. It isnt readily soluble in water, so it can't be IVed in its natural state, but with a little extra work, it can be IVed, but most often it is smoked.

I was not aware most of the H in Australia was base and can't be IV'd without extra work? [According to this report by the Crime Commission](http://www.crimecommission.gov.au/content/publications/iddr_2003_04/05_HEROIN.pdf), #4 is the most commonly found type of H in Oz.

Great Thread , Sixpartseven . Theres alot of very useful information in there that I think will really help out first time users . And i would also like to really stress the fact that under any circumstance you should never share a needle with someone. Ive seen alot of people catch tings in that way and it is very hearbreaking for their family . Please be careful everyone and always start low and work ure way up when using this stuff , its very easy to Od if your not opiate tolerant.

> #3 heroin is the base form, usually found in Europe, Australia, and pretty much anywhere that is not North and South America. It isnt readily soluble in water, so it can't be IVed in its natural state, but with a little extra work, it can be IVed, but most often it is smoked.

I was not aware most of the H in Australia was base and can't be IV'd without extra work? [According to this report by the Crime Commission](http://www.crimecommission.gov.au/content/publications/iddr_2003_04/05_HEROIN.pdf), #4 is the most commonly found type of H in Oz.

awesome thread, cant believe this hasn't been done already.


what about with powder(maybe tar as well, never had it in my area) the vinegar smell? ive heard people say that when you have a strong vinegar scent it tends to be stronger quality, and im not sure if this is 100% true, but my experience has backed it up.

well done man.  i think a lot of beginners will like that they can come here in OD and get all their questions answered all at once.  


i would add that in some cities, like dayton, for example, that it comes in geltabs as well.

Great Thread , Sixpartseven . Theres alot of very useful information in there that I think will really help out first time users . And i would also like to really stress the fact that under any circumstance you should never share a needle with someone. Ive seen alot of people catch tings in that way and it is very hearbreaking for their family . Please be careful everyone and always start low and work ure way up when using this stuff , its very easy to Od if your not opiate tolerant.

I'll edit it to reflect the suggestions youve made. I think to make this thing really good it will take contributions from all of you to fill it up with every last bit of basic info we can think of, so that just like JV said, beginners can find everything they need to know in one spot.


Phrozen or anyone else: In the dangers of IVing section, could you help me out with that. Phrozen, I know you and I have discussed it before, so you know what Im talking about. I just cant remember the names and what each one of them is.

I've only heard skag being used by BL'ers from the UK or, in real life, older Australians. Most youger Australians call it H or smack.

Heroin is diacetylmorphine. Vinegar is acetic acid. As mentioned vinegar would make sense as a byproduct.


However, it could also be that the acetylation process causes a vinegar smell too. I have some bulk acetyl-l-carnitine that smells like vinegar too.


Often , but not always, it can be a good sign IME. Most of the more whitish powder we get here reeks of vinegar and it is good.

#3 can be the same color. You are right that #4 can be found in the UK, but generally, from what Ive read, #3 is most popular in European countries.

New Jersey.. At the dope spot that I would frequent a lot there was an old guy in a wheelchair on the corner saying "I got toys!" to everyone who was there coppin shit. He'd sell you a fresh "toy" for a small price.

Heroin is diacetylmorphine. Vinegar is acetic acid. As mentioned vinegar would make sense as a byproduct.


However, it could also be that the acetylation process causes a vinegar smell too. I have some bulk acetyl-l-carnitine that smells like vinegar too.


Often , but not always, it can be a good sign IME. Most of the more whitish powder we get here reeks of vinegar and it is good.

New Jersey.. At the dope spot that I would frequent a lot there was an old guy in a wheelchair on the corner saying "I got toys!" to everyone who was there coppin shit. He'd sell you a fresh "toy" for a small price.

I was not aware most of the H in Australia was base and can't be IV'd without extra work? [According to this report by the Crime Commission](http://www.crimecommission.gov.au/content/publications/iddr_2003_04/05_HEROIN.pdf), #4 is the most commonly found type of H in Oz.

Great Thread , Sixpartseven . Theres alot of very useful information in there that I think will really help out first time users . And i would also like to really stress the fact that under any circumstance you should never share a needle with someone. Ive seen alot of people catch tings in that way and it is very hearbreaking for their family . Please be careful everyone and always start low and work ure way up when using this stuff , its very easy to Od if your not opiate tolerant.

I'll edit it to reflect the suggestions youve made. I think to make this thing really good it will take contributions from all of you to fill it up with every last bit of basic info we can think of, so that just like JV said, beginners can find everything they need to know in one spot.


Phrozen or anyone else: In the dangers of IVing section, could you help me out with that. Phrozen, I know you and I have discussed it before, so you know what Im talking about. I just cant remember the names and what each one of them is.

Not to nitpick but I wanted to add some westcoast slangterms-

Works/ (out)fits= needles

Chiva/ hop/ black= heroin


Add: Has anyone hear heard or used the term skag ever? Seems archaic but it could be regional. Same with horse actually.

I've only heard skag being used by BL'ers from the UK or, in real life, older Australians. Most youger Australians call it H or smack.

I'll edit it to reflect the suggestions youve made. I think to make this thing really good it will take contributions from all of you to fill it up with every last bit of basic info we can think of, so that just like JV said, beginners can find everything they need to know in one spot.


Phrozen or anyone else: In the dangers of IVing section, could you help me out with that. Phrozen, I know you and I have discussed it before, so you know what Im talking about. I just cant remember the names and what each one of them is.

Not to nitpick but I wanted to add some westcoast slangterms-

Works/ (out)fits= needles

Chiva/ hop/ black= heroin


Add: Has anyone hear heard or used the term skag ever? Seems archaic but it could be regional. Same with horse actually.

I've only heard skag being used by BL'ers from the UK or, in real life, older Australians. Most youger Australians call it H or smack.

Heroin is diacetylmorphine. Vinegar is acetic acid. As mentioned vinegar would make sense as a byproduct.


However, it could also be that the acetylation process causes a vinegar smell too. I have some bulk acetyl-l-carnitine that smells like vinegar too.


Often , but not always, it can be a good sign IME. Most of the more whitish powder we get here reeks of vinegar and it is good.

> #3 heroin is the base form, usually found in Europe, Australia, and pretty much anywhere that is not North and South America. It isnt readily soluble in water, so it can't be IVed in its natural state, but with a little extra work, it can be IVed, but most often it is smoked.

I was not aware most of the H in Australia was base and can't be IV'd without extra work? [According to this report by the Crime Commission](http://www.crimecommission.gov.au/content/publications/iddr_2003_04/05_HEROIN.pdf), #4 is the most commonly found type of H in Oz.

Great Thread , Sixpartseven . Theres alot of very useful information in there that I think will really help out first time users . And i would also like to really stress the fact that under any circumstance you should never share a needle with someone. Ive seen alot of people catch tings in that way and it is very hearbreaking for their family . Please be careful everyone and always start low and work ure way up when using this stuff , its very easy to Od if your not opiate tolerant.

> #3 heroin is the base form, usually found in Europe, Australia, and pretty much anywhere that is not North and South America. It isnt readily soluble in water, so it can't be IVed in its natural state, but with a little extra work, it can be IVed, but most often it is smoked.

I was not aware most of the H in Australia was base and can't be IV'd without extra work? [According to this report by the Crime Commission](http://www.crimecommission.gov.au/content/publications/iddr_2003_04/05_HEROIN.pdf), #4 is the most commonly found type of H in Oz.

awesome thread, cant believe this hasn't been done already.


what about with powder(maybe tar as well, never had it in my area) the vinegar smell? ive heard people say that when you have a strong vinegar scent it tends to be stronger quality, and im not sure if this is 100% true, but my experience has backed it up.

well done man.  i think a lot of beginners will like that they can come here in OD and get all their questions answered all at once.  


i would add that in some cities, like dayton, for example, that it comes in geltabs as well.

Great Thread , Sixpartseven . Theres alot of very useful information in there that I think will really help out first time users . And i would also like to really stress the fact that under any circumstance you should never share a needle with someone. Ive seen alot of people catch tings in that way and it is very hearbreaking for their family . Please be careful everyone and always start low and work ure way up when using this stuff , its very easy to Od if your not opiate tolerant.

I'll edit it to reflect the suggestions youve made. I think to make this thing really good it will take contributions from all of you to fill it up with every last bit of basic info we can think of, so that just like JV said, beginners can find everything they need to know in one spot.


Phrozen or anyone else: In the dangers of IVing section, could you help me out with that. Phrozen, I know you and I have discussed it before, so you know what Im talking about. I just cant remember the names and what each one of them is.

I've only heard skag being used by BL'ers from the UK or, in real life, older Australians. Most youger Australians call it H or smack.

Heroin is diacetylmorphine. Vinegar is acetic acid. As mentioned vinegar would make sense as a byproduct.


However, it could also be that the acetylation process causes a vinegar smell too. I have some bulk acetyl-l-carnitine that smells like vinegar too.


Often , but not always, it can be a good sign IME. Most of the more whitish powder we get here reeks of vinegar and it is good.

#3 can be the same color. You are right that #4 can be found in the UK, but generally, from what Ive read, #3 is most popular in European countries.

New Jersey.. At the dope spot that I would frequent a lot there was an old guy in a wheelchair on the corner saying "I got toys!" to everyone who was there coppin shit. He'd sell you a fresh "toy" for a small price.

Heroin is diacetylmorphine. Vinegar is acetic acid. As mentioned vinegar would make sense as a byproduct.


However, it could also be that the acetylation process causes a vinegar smell too. I have some bulk acetyl-l-carnitine that smells like vinegar too.


Often , but not always, it can be a good sign IME. Most of the more whitish powder we get here reeks of vinegar and it is good.

New Jersey.. At the dope spot that I would frequent a lot there was an old guy in a wheelchair on the corner saying "I got toys!" to everyone who was there coppin shit. He'd sell you a fresh "toy" for a small price.

I was not aware most of the H in Australia was base and can't be IV'd without extra work? [According to this report by the Crime Commission](http://www.crimecommission.gov.au/content/publications/iddr_2003_04/05_HEROIN.pdf), #4 is the most commonly found type of H in Oz.

Great Thread , Sixpartseven . Theres alot of very useful information in there that I think will really help out first time users . And i would also like to really stress the fact that under any circumstance you should never share a needle with someone. Ive seen alot of people catch tings in that way and it is very hearbreaking for their family . Please be careful everyone and always start low and work ure way up when using this stuff , its very easy to Od if your not opiate tolerant.

I'll edit it to reflect the suggestions youve made. I think to make this thing really good it will take contributions from all of you to fill it up with every last bit of basic info we can think of, so that just like JV said, beginners can find everything they need to know in one spot.


Phrozen or anyone else: In the dangers of IVing section, could you help me out with that. Phrozen, I know you and I have discussed it before, so you know what Im talking about. I just cant remember the names and what each one of them is.

Not to nitpick but I wanted to add some westcoast slangterms-

Works/ (out)fits= needles

Chiva/ hop/ black= heroin


Add: Has anyone hear heard or used the term skag ever? Seems archaic but it could be regional. Same with horse actually.

I've only heard skag being used by BL'ers from the UK or, in real life, older Australians. Most youger Australians call it H or smack.

I'll edit it to reflect the suggestions youve made. I think to make this thing really good it will take contributions from all of you to fill it up with every last bit of basic info we can think of, so that just like JV said, beginners can find everything they need to know in one spot.


Phrozen or anyone else: In the dangers of IVing section, could you help me out with that. Phrozen, I know you and I have discussed it before, so you know what Im talking about. I just cant remember the names and what each one of them is.

Not to nitpick but I wanted to add some westcoast slangterms-

Works/ (out)fits= needles

Chiva/ hop/ black= heroin


Add: Has anyone hear heard or used the term skag ever? Seems archaic but it could be regional. Same with horse actually.

I've only heard skag being used by BL'ers from the UK or, in real life, older Australians. Most youger Australians call it H or smack.

Awesome thread 6/7.


Haven't finished reading it all yet but one thing I can throw into the mix is that UK heroin is almost always light brown powder. This is #4 , correct me if I'm wrong?

> what about with powder(maybe tar as well, never had it in my area) the vinegar smell? ive heard people say that when you have a strong vinegar scent it tends to be stronger quality, and im not sure if this is 100% true, but my experience has backed it up.

Heroin is diacetylmorphine. Vinegar is acetic acid. As mentioned vinegar would make sense as a byproduct.


However, it could also be that the acetylation process causes a vinegar smell too. I have some bulk acetyl-l-carnitine that smells like vinegar too.


Often , but not always, it can be a good sign IME. Most of the more whitish powder we get here reeks of vinegar and it is good.

#3 can be the same color. You are right that #4 can be found in the UK, but generally, from what Ive read, #3 is most popular in European countries.

Not personally, no. What region are you from? Im sure its probably slang for your specific region.

New Jersey.. At the dope spot that I would frequent a lot there was an old guy in a wheelchair on the corner saying "I got toys!" to everyone who was there coppin shit. He'd sell you a fresh "toy" for a small price.
