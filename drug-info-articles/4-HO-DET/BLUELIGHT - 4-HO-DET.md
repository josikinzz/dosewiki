4-ho-DET has produced some decent experiences. I could have gotten the same experience, with a more chemical feel from MDA. I'd compare it more to MDA than mushrooms... but not as rushy by far.

**4-HO-DET anyone?**


Hey so I read up and did a little research on this chemical and it seems to me like i will be having alot of fun trying this bad boy out. From what Ive gathered from Thikal the chemical seems to have alot of similarities with psilocin (4-HO-DMT), so Im really looking forward to this, but before I gave it a go I wanted to check if any of you had taken this tryptamine before, and how you felt  about the overall experience. peace

I've tried ethocin (4-Ho-DET), as well as the acetate ester (4-AcO-DET), on many occasions.  At least eight to ten times I'd say between the two.  I could tell no difference whatsoever either in potency or action between the acetoxy and hydroxy form, and I consider them completely interchangabe.


Most of my experiences were with swallowing the chemical, but I did vaporize 4-AcO-DET freebase on two occasions.  Smoking it felt no different that eating it, other than the fact that it only lasted an hour (instead of four) and came on with quite a rush.  I enjoyed eating it much more.


I'm not going to add very much about the effects of ethocin, because you can easily read my trip reports at erowid or do a search for past threads in which I have written more detailed comments.  I have at least three reports on this material, and the last one (Pain of the World) says "4-AcO-DET" but chemical tests later showed the sample to be ethocin.  Anyway...


I used to think 4-Ho/AcO-DET was excellent stuff, and I enjoyed it as a short-acting tryptamine that was a nice alternative to mushrooms.  But having since tried other 4-substituted tryptamines (4-Ho-DiPT, aka iprocin, and 4-AcO-MiPT), my opinion on ethocin has changed.


Now this chemical really does not have a lot to offer me.  It just seems rather "empty" of content when compared to iprocin, mushrooms, and 4-AcO-MiPT.  And while iprocin and 4-AcO-MiPT seem quite unique compared to mushrooms, ethocin (to me) just feels like a shorter-acting version of mushrooms with most of the interesting parts taken away.


Again, I used to think ethocin was great.  But having now tried other synthetic 4-substituted tryptamines, it has become obsolete.  My personal rank of preference now is: iprocin > 4-AcO-MiPT > ethocin.


I have no plans to ever use ethocin again.  Why drive in a Honda with no A/C and no CD player when you can ride in a nice SUV with all the extras?  That is kind of how I look at it.


I never (even when I liked ethocin) considered it "fun."  It was never very euphoric and isn't as visual as mushrooms.  If you are taking it for mere enjoyment, you might look into other things.  Just my opinion.

My friend has this to say:

"I like 4-HO-DET far more than 4-HO-MiPT, in the small number of times I was able to sample it.  4-HO-DET was a little speedier and more acidic than 4-HO-MiPT, and has a less dark, overwhelming character.  One thing to note about 4-HO-DET is that I didn't seem to get many visuals until about the 30mg dosage mark -- but when I dosed up in that range, it was very impressive (as vivid as 4-ho-mipt but a lot gentler in a certain way).  Miprocin just seems terrifying emotionally beyond the 20mg mark."

I got some 4-ho-det. I don't really know how much I would want to take. I read the entries in TIHKaL.


I read somewhere, but I forget that someone smoked some 4-ho-det. I proceeded to smoke a small bit. Nothing profound, but there was *something*

I'm resurrecting this teeny-weeny year-old thread to see if anyone else has had any experiences with HO-DET. I'm specifically curious about JuicyJay's smoked HO-DET experience, I know the 4-ACO base of this chemical is active smoked, but has anyone else had any success smoking the HO form?


Never had pure 4-HO-DMT (Yet!), but my experience with 4-HO-DET was very unlike any mushroom experience I've had. Lasts half as long without much colour intensification, that and the stimulated and twitchy body feeling turned me off... I seem to echo morninggloryseed's sentiments in the "Pain of the World" trip report on Erowid, for me this chem just has a "sharpness" to it that disagrees with my brain chemistry or tastes or something... It's great that you enjoy it though, I just want to warn you that this chem had the most side effects of any RC I've sampled so far. A 14mg dose precipitated some visual changes that I can still notice... Patterns within static growing to full tryptamine OEV's lasting for weeks afterwards, especially when cannabis was involved. Just something to watch out for, especially if you are into using low doses regularly, which is something I wouldn't recommend with this chem. Aside from that... Good luck with your journeys ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Like you said, HO-DET doesn't seem to be all that interesting until you get into the higher doses... The effects I experienced at 14mg were probably related to not being "fully in" the HO-DET room, so to speak. Thus I only experienced the threshold annoyances that are not the features of the full psychedelic state revealed by that chemical. I was dissapointed by that experience in some deep way I couldn't describe at the time and can only vaguely grasp at now, I think it was the choice of dose as well as the brevity of the chemical. I think at that point I just wanted to be "wowed" by something, which 16mg of 4-AcO-DMT did much better a month or two later.


To clarify my last comments, the body load was not entirely "stimulating" but rather sharp, like an aching around the facial muscles that was made worse by the tremors. It was entirely possible to lay down and focus out of the bodily symptoms, but I really doubt I could have done anything other than that, if you know what I mean.

I get the same negative effects General Patton gets when I take 4-aco-dipt, but 4-aco-det feels very clean with a simular body vibration and energy to 4-ho-dmt.  The only downside in my opinion is slightly weeker visuals, but this can be changed by taking higher doses, at least I would think?

Yeah, the visuals get extremely intense and dissociative at high doses.

How interesting that 4-aco-dipt has the same effect on you as this chemical on me... Haha, now I want to get my hands on some 4-ACO/HO-DIPT and see if I gel with it, alchemically of course. Now that I think about the circumstances of that trip, I'm sure the set and setting contributed to the bodily vibrations (My single dorm room, hostile hallmate across from me etc... Was nice curling up in my bed in winter while nature raged outside though ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) ) While I think that played somewhat of a role, but the fact is that "twitchiness" is often described as a side-effect of these type of drugs (Oh those twitchy trypts!) makes the think that they have a greater tendency to cause that reaction regardless of set + setting, not that it happens to everyone... But when it does, it's often unpleasant. Which is why I would caution users to try and avoid it at all costs by taking the right dose in the right place and time. Harm reduction and such, but you knew that all, right? Hehe yeah, carry on...

**4-HO-DET: Anyone tried it?**


Can anyone give a comparison of this to mushrooms possibly? I can't find any detailed TRP's on it. 

The most shrooms I have ever eaten was 3.2 grams of some good ass cubies; I tripped balls haha. Also, my friend said 20 mg's was equal to an eighth of shrooms.

So, I'm just wondering if this chem is worth investing in.

By using the index or search engine you could have found the thread I am merging this with, in any case there are few accounts on it. I myself have 4-AcO-DET stashed in the freezer waiting for a good moment.

I'm probably going to dose around 25 mg on this one as I haven't used a tryptamine in a month or so, so I doubt there will be a cross tolerance.

 My friend (and an erowid report I just found ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)) told me that in the 25-30 range you can see three-dimensional CEV's, which is extremely interesting to me. I must experience it haha.

I am skeptical that you will experience the exact same as him, but much much more importantly I am skeptical that you could not get those CEVs from a lot of other analogues, actually I have had them with 4-HO-MET and they were absolutely incredible. Indeed at higher doses. 40 mg total, redosed 20 mg within a couple of hours which really upped the intensity a lot. Smoking cannabis with almost no cannabis tolerance REALLY did the trick though.

I'll probably smoke 1-2 mg's of AM-2201. I can't smoke for a while, my job is drug testing :/ (bummer)

I'm looking forward to it though. I've just heard it's kind of superficial or shallow, not very deep or introspective. Is that true with any other 4-HO sub's? (I'm asking that because I know you haven't tried DET yet.)

I have plans on getting this compound(or its acetate ester), so if anyone try it, please make a report, especially if you can compare it to other 4-substituted tryptamines.

Well... 4-HO-MET is nice and enjoyable, but very "generic" psychedelic for me. My two trips on it(on 21 mg and 17 mg) wasn't very deep. But maybe it is just a matter of dose.![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

That doesn't really bother me though. If I wanted a really meaningful trip I'd go buy some acid or smoke some DMT. Sometimes it's nice not to have a mind-expanding thoughtful trip, and just have fun.

I'd compare it to the after effects of a harsh all night MDA trip,

slight irritations, still some stimulation but no euphoria


And quite a bit of color intensification and visuals when not focusing.


Not a drug I'd ever use again after trying it.

Just plugged 20 mg in water and wow it hits fast as hell this way Jesus. Will up date in a bit. There is barely anything on this stuff. How the hell does nausea happen when I plug something? I feel the indole 'about to get sick' feeling but it kills me that this does this when I plug it. Could be remnants of the MXE of earlier but whew plugging goes home fast.


oh and 3-4 ish area i knew who i was but me and god talked a lot

Gosh, why is there so little info on this stuff? Have had access to it for a while now, but haven't gotten around to it, partially due to the sheer lack of information. The DET family does not seem that popular to me, and I haven't tried any of its members yet. It almost seems like the dialkyltryptamines are all more body-oriented, tremor-inducing, and potentially spiritual than the headdy, highly visual, laughy good time n, methyl-tryptamines. So I suppose I could compare it to 4-ho-met thusly. In any event, I'll definitely let you guys know what I think whenever I DO try this one.

I love 4-ho-det,  i have used it around 4 times,  if 4-ho-met is shrooms light 4-ho-det is shrooms dark for me, the experince is alot darker fuller and more visual.  I have very emotional relises with this one!!  very good for getting those life on track experinces.  My last experince with this chem i was in my bed cycleing through emotions while having these very sensual rushes.  At one point i focused on the sensual rush and held on to it, as i was holding my visuals turned to naked hot women and the rush turned into a great tanric feeling. I held the orgasmic feeling for a few min swimming in naked women and feeling like orgasim pulses through out my body.  After it passed i check my underwere to see if i did shoot a load but i did not just total mind orgasim.

Ordered 100 mgs to sample. Really enjoyed psilacetin. Was almost considering taking it and introducing  4-HO-DET in a smaller dose, to analyze. The one experience with 4-AcO-DMT I had was easy going, warm, comfortable. 


Then again may do by itself. I aim to go high, but I'm starting low, I think.

Tried about 12 mg of 4-ho-DET HCL in juice. General discomfort, not real nausea but general ill feeling. Glad I didn't take more. Some tremors, not fine ones but kind of chunky unpleasant ones. Mild visuals didn't make up for the discomfort. Made me feel generally icky. Just doesn't seem to agree with my system.

Not to say you are wrong, but I find sometimes (sometimes) with certain drugs you need to take "enough" to be engaged. Sometimes lower dosages such as this just have a bad effect profile, for whatever reason. Not saying it didn't agree with you/you it... Just wondering. 


This is precisely why I took a higher dose of psilacetin my first experience. I didn't want time to think about it. Or, I hadn't tripped hard in many years. Not having done so, I figured that was the way.


Now I'm more nervous about trying the stuffs.

12mg of a 4-sub tryptamine isn't very much IMO. The only time I ever got general discomfort from a tryp was when I underdosed 4-aco-dmt, at around 12mg or so. I think you just landed in the do-not-want zone bro, this zone is common at low tryptamine doses.


Huh two posts about almost the same thing, at the same time! I wouldn't be nervous dude, I have access to some ethocin I want to try as well, but I'm confident it'll be awesome. Tryptamines have never really done me wrong.

So I finally got a chance to sample this substance and I had quite a good time. The TR section of the site seems to be denying me access so I will post an abbreviated version here. 


I dosed ~25mg (±5mg because my scale and capping process are not what they would be with proper funding)

The Come-up was unusually smooth. Over the course of two hours, my mind slowly expanded to fill the air around me. My body was a languid set of limbs, hanging down form my head. Movement was loose and cartoonish. I seemed to drift in an out of attention to what I was doing. As I was listening to music, suddenly I realized that I had missed a minute of the song in a daydream. There was however a distinct lack of visuals to look at.


That changed when I went outside to take a solitary walk through my neighborhood. On the way out I had an easy conversation with my anti-drug girlfriend who seemed to have no clue as to my psychedelic state. Outside my surroundings become much more fascinating. The wet ground reflected the reds and greens of the streetlights, creating a festive christmas light show on the ground. The 4-HO-DET was most certainly enhancing those colors. Walking by a house coved in Christmas lights and sparkling snowflakes was magical, though only for a moment. Like most shiny things, It was only interesting the first time you looked at it. It was at moments like this that grim thoughts tried to invade my brain; Anxiety and depression try desperately to ruin my trip, But cheer, optimism and good humor always prevail.


I guess it's appropriate at this point to note that I have been taking Clonazepam (among other benzos) every 2 or 3 days for the last month, and two nights in a row before the trip. The reason I mention this is that I felt tremors in my heart throughout the trip. This could have been due to the 4-HO DET or mild benzo withdrawl which I quelled at T+3:00 with 1mg Clonazepam.


I had heard much on both sides of the argument about whether benzos cancel out a trip, or whether they just calm a person down so that the trip is not as overwhelming, so testing this out for myself was part of my motivation for dosing the Clonazepam. It seemed to me that the Clonazepam did not really impede the visual aspect of the 4-HO-DET. It did however dull my mental processes as usual. This reduced the clarity of each moment and took away from the feeling of profundity that comes with any good psychedelic experience. However, it seemed that my ability to judge the 4-HO-DET's effectiveness, which seemed to drop off pretty quickly around the fifth hour, was not significantly impaired by the Clonazepam.


Overall I think 4-HO-DET is definitely interesting and I will give it another go. It is not as powerful— and in your face, as Mushrooms or 4-AcO-DMT; but it did have some sort of unique magic to it. Perhaps I will dose it with a phenethylamine at some point it hopes that they will compliment each other nicely. I believe they will.

Yeah, I too have taken 10-12mg and felt not really good, but had a marvellous ++++ at 18mg. 


This is a gem, imo !

I tried my batch of this a month or so ago. Nice stuff, dosed a little on the low side since it was new to me, so I was a little underwhelmed. But seeing as the acetate ester didn't get terribly interesting to me until I got  >25mg, I wouldn't be surprised if its the same for the free phenol. Some friends have tried both & found the 20mg range perfectly adequate for their purposes. I seem to be a little resistant to the DET's for some reason. Though it seems I'm not alone in that. Odd though b/c I get decent effect out of <20mg of 4-AcO-DMT & 4-HO-MET. Go figure... MMMV lol

Thanks Kapitan. Trying to give an informative description of a completely subjective experience is a fun writing exercise. Writing while coming down is especially helpful for integrating the experience. That's why some of sentences aren't as fluid as they should be though.


I would like to see someone do a high dose experiment. 40-50mg range. I might do it myself if I get the time, but I doubt that will happen until January. I have other samples to taste :D

I was actually planning a trip in that range sometime during early 2013. I've taken ~40mg of the acetate ester, & that was a jolly good time. I expect it'll be roughly similar with ethocin.

Just wondering if anyone had any info in regards to longterm storage of this (4 ho det)?


I am looking to get some, but am wondering how long itll keep before degrading significantly.  


I am looking at 4 oh det hcl, which would be stored in a vial, surrounded by dessicant, in a mason jar and in the freezer.


Does anyone have any info or experience storing this stuff for the long term?


Thanks,

Tired

I have had a plastic bag in the fridge for over 1.5years which is still as active as the day I got it.


How you're describing to store it should definetly last +3years, IMO.

I have access to 4-HO-DET... Now, I hear this is the "darker trip" so more like a narcotic hallucinogen than a "hyper/energetic" hallucinogen, right?


There is NO Big and Dandy on this substance from what I can find...

I want to know if 4-HO-DET would be safe to replace for -MET when attempting to achieve "Mushroom like" effects? It ALL breaks down into psilobin right? So it should all be similar yeah?


Does anyone have any experience with 4-HO-DET?

No, most tryptamines will not break down into psilocin. Different substitutions on the nitrogen will give significantly different effects. May I recommend searching [Erowid](http://www.erowid.org/experiences/subs/exp_4HODET.shtml) or the [internet as a whole](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=4+ho-det) before asking about drugs in the future - bluelight is far from the only resource.

Last night I vaped 7 mg of 4-HO-DET freebase, at the peak of my mild pscilocetin trip (17~19 mg insufflated) and instant visuals were produced. I experienced a massive rush, and could help but smile as I fell through the smokey-purple CEVs. It was a great way to boost the trip, I was consumed in mandalas made of violet smoke every time I closed my eyes. 


Another freebase experiment is definitely needed.

4-HO-DET is tied with 4-HO-DMT for my favorite out of the 4-xx-xxxx series. I've tried it in doses up to 32 mg insufilated and never had a bad time. It's fairly comparable to psilocin really maybe a little less flashy with the visuals but it is still massively visual also fairly usefull for introspection a little less than psilocin. Super worthwhile substance. I'm surprised this thread is so small.

4-HO-DET is the most stimulating tryptamine I have done, and also the most psychedelic out of 4-ACO-DMT, 4-HO-DET, and 5-MEO-MIPT.  It gave the strongest psychedelic effects but made my heart feel uncomfortable (actually very good and comfortable but too active... very strong adrenaline feeling but without the pain from a similar feeling on a phenethylamine).


The most notable feeling in the trip was moments I picture fire and ice and felt the 'feelings' of fire and ice over my body.  Strange drug.  Better visuals than 4-ACO-DMT too.

Vaporizing is almost always awesome.  Mostly with tryptamines but 2C-P and NBOMES are awesome too.  You should try it.

I dosed 14-16mg of this stuff , about 14 hours ago. 


Fast come up but never really developed into much but slight tryptamine buzz. Altered headspace , slight body buzz but no visuals and overall much milder then I thought it would be


Back to baseline fully in like 4 hours I'd say. Peak only lasted about an hour.


A couple things though , had dosed etizolam , kinda high with no benzo tolerance 12 hours prior to get to sleep after 4-fa use.

Used 4-HO-mipt 4 days earlier. I'm not sure how tolerance works but ime 4-HO-mipt feels like it creates the most tolerance out of the tryptamines I've used (4-aco-DMt , 4-HO-met , 4-HO-mipt , 5-meo-mipt , mushrooms) , my theory is because it causes the most intense trips out of the ones I've tried. Longest lasting for me too , most intense visuals , quite a bit of pysedelic headspace , lots of euphoria & can be emotionally swingy (have went from 1 hour lmao to the next crying).... Compared to say it's 5-meo cousin which produces nearly no tolerance issues , but I dose that one very low (4-6mg) most time. So I'm thinking a combo of a benzo with a long half life , my 4-HO-mipt use 4 days prior and the low dose created less then stellar results. Def felt it had potential , was in that stage where you feel your about to have a somewhat intense trip but never devolps. 


I took this before going to see jurrasic park 3d IMAX , and being my first trip with this stuff I shot low whereas the other 4-HO/aco I go about 2O-3Omg.


Anyways on to why I'm up at 6:3O a.m...


Perhaps this is just a coincidence and I'm reaching but in tihkal shuglin mentions 'I slept ok but something was wrong at a deep level,


I haven't drank alcohol or smoked weed in nearly a month , both of which surpress my dreams , or at least make me not remember them if I am having them. Usually the first week or two ill have very bizarre , life-like dreams & nightmares but this hasn't been the case for at least 1O days now. Just regular , not overly intense dreams. 


I've had sleep paralysis once , 5-6 years ago that I attribute to low dose serequal used for insomnia (I quit it after that haven't had 1 since). It was one of the scariest things in my life.


I think I just experienced my 2nd sleep paralysis incident. I was able to snap out of it a lot quicker then last time but still has me fairly shook up.


I 'woke up' , eyes open , podcast still on from when I went to bed around 1 and thought I heard knocking on the door. I then heard footsteps and seen shadow under the door. I was convinced someone had broke in.


All easily explainable as my small dog is locked in the next room and she will paw at the door sometimes , and my Doberman is out roaming the rest of the house so likely was him walking , but while in this state I thought they were both in bed with me so never considered that (use to let them sleep in my bed) , and deep down had comfort knowing (well thinking) my Doberman was in the bed with me so didn't lead to a total freak out like my prior sleep paralysis episode which I reacted how a 4 year old does having a bad dream. While in this weird trance like state I calmed myself by saying it was likely my cat had got out and was pawing at the front door to get it. I don't own a cat. Then I thought my gf text me which was comforting , but I couldn't actually text back and I tried for sometime (trance/paralyzed feeling)... Of course no text from her.


I'd say this lasted 5 minutes? Felt like ages though. I just layed staring at the light from underneath the door scared for my life.


Sorry this long post doesn't have much content about the chemical of discussion but with the tihkal entry and having taken it 14 hours ago I feel it might have something to do with this bizarre , rare incident. That and I'm wide awake now and wanted to record this while fresh in my head.


Anyways I'm taking good 1-2 week break , from all drugs aside from maybe kratom maybe 2x a week , and letting my tolerance go down until I give the 4-HO-det another shot , which will likely be at 2O-25mg. Since finding these RC's I've been using psychedelics far too often and while it did achieve what I was looking for when I decided to dabble in psychedelics about 5 months ago , after a 5-6 year absence  , stoping my cocaine use (4+ months none now ) and quit drinking (only 3 weeks but lots of week-2 week breaks in last 4 months and way less consumption most of my times of use) I'm doing myself no good tripping multiple times a week and will only kill the magic.

So I'm finally getting around to doing my second 4-HO-DET experiment. I have 50-55mg 4-HO-DET (variance due to Gemini-20 piece of crap scale), chilling in a capsule that shall be consumed within the next 36 hours.


I'll report back with my findings on a higher dose experiment ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

I've bio-assayed 45mg of 4-AcO-DET (which is somewhat less potent than 4-HO-DET) and the experience was quite intense. 50-55mg of 4-HO-DET should be very powerful indeed, unless your material is of poor quality and/or you've built up significant tolerance and/or you're a tryptamine hardhead. You should have a sitter around, just in case.

I have always been a hardhead and am quite experienced. I'm at T+30 right now (my plans for yesterday got messed up) and I can already tell this will be quite the ride. What people said about bodily stimulation is accurate. I may need extra benzo to calm the tremors, though I will try to make it closer to the the peak before deciding.

Hang in there, buddy. Try your best not to take the benzo, but if you must, you must. That's a whopper of a dose. Good luck. Please tell us how everything went when you return.

In my experience the heart will start beating funny after about an hour and a half.  I didn't like that part one bit, but I don't know how unsafe it truly is.

Well I had a good evening overall with this substance. I think that my 55mg dosage was probably too much. 4-HO-DET did not seem equipped to take me as far as some of the other tryptamines I've tried. By pushing to 55mg I got more stimulation and more visuals to an extent. but the visuals are still nothing compared to 4-AcO-DMT (the benchmark of the 4-subs) nor was my mind profoundly fucked like 4-AcO-DMT has done at high dosages.


It seems to me that 4-HO-DET is best suited as perhaps a good concert drug, or a good half of a combination for a more profound experience. But it does not seem suited for blowing one's mind.

It didn't blow my mind, but 4-AcO-DMT didn't do shit to my mind, not a single breeze.  4-HO-DET at least gave me some wind.

I am familiar with two batches of 4-Ho-DET nearly 14 years old...both the freebase, and both have been known to hang around in the freezer, in glass vials with a few beads of silica loose in the material.....sometimes they were stored away from a freezer.  Both batches did discolor over time (as do all the psilocin family) but both neither seems to have lost any potency.


Personally, this psilocin cousin was only interesting because it was an original Sandoz product as created by Hoffman...and so is historically relevant.  Effects wise, pretty furious stuff (even at modest dosages) with a lot of trembling (or 'the shakes', depending on how you look at it) coupled with anxiety.  Was ok when hiking outdoors but the evenings at home with it were more white knuckle than anything.


Not my cup of tea.

Anyhow, I have 4-HO-DET in cold storage but have not bio-assayed it yet. On the other hand, I'm very familiar with 4-AcO-DET and I love it. I find it easy on the body, not especially stimulating, and pretty deep at higher doses. Open-eye visuals tend to be earthy and rich; closed-eye phenomena is gorgeous, slow moving and decidedly three-dimensional, almost tactile. It's intriguing that the general consensus regarding 4-HO-DET is so different from my experiences with 4-AcO-DET. I even had a very poignant ++++ the third time I tested it.

This sounds really similar to my 4-HO-DET experiences, however the 4-HO-DET was a bit harder hitting than what you describe, which may be the cause of the stimulation.  The visuals and psychedelia come in surges.

* have used 4-ho-det at least 5 different times and they were all different. I seem to notice lower doses are more stimulating and uncomfortable(20-40mgs) but very high doses 80-100mgs fully psychedelic and amazing.

So less than 2 years later I opened the mason jar in the freezer which contained the aforementioned 4 ho det hcl.

To my surprise it had changed significantly in colour (from off white / light gray) to very obviously gray.  Though I am not sure why this is a surprise as MGS noted there would be colour change, perhaps because I have the hcl and not the freebase?  


Anyways, I can not comment on any change in potency because I never got around to trying it since purchasing.  Just thought I would share in regards to the colour change (however helpful that may or may not be ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png) )

Yeah many tryptamines (freebase or otherwise - in fact I think the freebase is significantly less stable than fumarate salts at least, which are the common salts available these days as they're quite stable) will discolor over time regardless of how they're stored.  Generally they retain the majority of their potency.

What is a comfortable dosage 'regimen' when trying 4-AcO-DET or 4-HO-DET for the first (few) time(s)? Assuming that they are about equal and we just need to adjust dosage by molecular mass?

Can anybody recommend a general first time dosage for 4-HO-DET?


And what's the general consensus? There is little information online.


How similiar is it to 4-ACO-DET? I always thought that seemed quite appealing.

I would go as far as to say that it is one of the only synthetic psychedelics besides LSD that I have ever tried that I actually think is worth taking for any reason other than checking it off your to-do list.

To me, they are indistinguishable in every way, and worlds apart from every other psychedelic I have tried.

I can certainly try. First of all, the body high is present but subtle, certainly not like the orgasmic ecstasy of the psilocybin experience. This can be or good, in the sense that it means you have less a safety net for having a negative experience if you are prone to them, but it also means that you have fewer physical distractions during positive experiences. This is significant because the 4-HO-DET experience is capable of taking you far away from yourself if you let it; I have never not had out-of-body experiences or ego death after ingesting it, which I cannot say about any other psychedelic, period. Of course, this does not mean the same will be true for you, it is just worth mentioning from my own experiences. As for the visuals, they are quite unique next to all other serotonergics I have taken; they bare some resemblance to psilocybin, but not as much as other synthetic tryptamines do. At low doses for me there is a very low amount of sensory distortions such as fractals or kaleidoscopes relative to the psychological weight of the trip, but with a surprising amount of realistic, dream-like, almost hyper-3D imagery mixed in with them, like seeing visions overlaying reality. At higher doses, the patterns become more apparent, complex, and colorful, and will transform and merge in ways that cannot even be logically rationalized while watching them, and there is often a lot of tunnel vision as well. At that point, occurrences such as perceptions of entities and hyperspatial terrains and innate "understandings" of delirious scenarios may occur, which in my experience can be quite powerful even at lucid doses; either a sitter or considerable prior experience with strong psychedelic doses is recommended by me before attempting to reach this point. Overall, the trip tends to last about three to five hours, but I could imagine it being extended with very large doses.


Again, this is all just for me, so it may be different for you. But I think that's about the simplest way I could sum up my experiences with it.

Hmmm, sounds like something I'd enjoy; thanks for the thorough description. I love bluelight.


I can certainly see why people say it reminds them of MDA from that description. What kind of doses are required? Is there a sharp response curve?

For me, 4-AcO-DET (I haven't tried 4-HBO-DET) was absolutely nothing remotely like MDA, but it was a lot like that description from Lys.  For me it's a pretty jagged feeling psychedelic in many ways, I didn't experience any euphoria, in fact my trip was centered around my mortality for the peak and it was difficult for a while.  It was, however, a truly unique and beautiful trip, very useful and honest and piercing.

In TiHKAL Shulgin mentions 4-HO-DET rapidly degrades. At the least 4-AcO-DET should have the benefit of being more stable.

Well well.. i was wondering how long i had this stuff.. only time i took it out was to have a few doses weighed in the lab then back to storage... 


Ive read that this can be stimulating and relatively underwhelming compared to mushrooms or 4 aco dmt.. so i figured todays hike with friends would be the perfect time to try it for the first time. Its either 22 or 15 (why i had chose those values im not sure...but i dont have access to a scale now and although i could dissolve and  measure volumetrically...) im leaning towards 22. Aiming for some introspection and connection while remaining functionable and lucid for our hike around water falls..

If you have a low psychedelic tolerance, I suggest 15mg if going out on a hike with friends (you may just keep an additional 7mg to take within an hour if not enough) or take 22mg to stay somewhere inside and safe.


For me this chem showed itself pretty strong and deep. It also has a quite pronounced tremor with some people, not as much with me but noticeable. Its not stimulating, rather filling you with weird electricity. It is deeply spiritual and introspective for me too. Very nice chem that I've had good results from using only 15mg! Disappointments with it happen when people expect mushroom trip or something similar - its very different IMO, unique and quite a short acting too - dont be surprised to be back at baseline by the 4th hour.


Safe and fun travels! ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

I decided to go with 22. 

Despite the moderate tolerance (indulging last mid september on some 5 meo mipt) I am usually quite hard headed, unfortunately. 


I went in with little expectations other than it being a stimulating tryptamine. However like you mentioned volsam that was not really the case. I had no desire to power through our walk, instead i just meandered behind enjoying my buzz.   


Body wise I found the tremors most noticeable in my uppers thighs. They would ripple periodically as my body overflowed with energy. Then quite again until the energy built to critical mass and my thighs quiverred again. I found this sort of energy comparable to the energy of 2ci, but this was much less stimulating. Otherwise my body felt light as i bounced along on my way. Tightness in my chest (caused by muscleskeletal issues) was neither exasperated nor absolved. I found some stomach unrest on the way up - i felt my first alerts in less than 20 and peaking some time around the hour mark (i didnt bother to look at my phone for the duration of the walk). Upon our return at just shy of 3 hours i was long off my peak. But even now im not back to base... I can still feel it lingering. Especially in my eyes and my body - i can feel its energy.


Visually, honestly im not sure. Nothing spectacular. Colour, enhancements, waves, maybe some breathing. Nature was definitely more alive than normal thats for sure.


Mentally wasnt profound either but i didnt really have a chance to explore as the path was pretty busy and the kids were being kids. Though i found it to have a relatively neutral, yet warm headspace. Things were definitely more comical - i laughed myself to tears (not something id usually do) more than once


Socially there was no deep connections or conversations but they flowed freely as they would naturally amongst good friends. 


Tl;dr 

Overall i enjoyed the experience. Id explore again, at home, at a lower level (in hopes of reducing some of the tremor - though it wasnt horrific) to truly get a feel for this material and decide where to go next dose wise. Although its not at the top of my list, Im glad i stocked this material when I could.

Glad to hear you managed to enjoy it, **tired of crap**! :D


For me, both 4-HO-DET and 4-AcO-DET are prime introspective tools. They are quite good for meditation practices and rituals. They have definite healing potential aimed straight at the center of my ego's hedonism. I wouldnt take them for just "plain fun" but I guess they may be used like that too. 


Doing yoga exercises and stretches on it is very pleasurable - all the tremors turn into some orgasmic energy movement inside you! ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


The catharsis when using them right may get soooo good and relieving! 8)

Yes, for the past number of years most of my sessions have been filled with yoga and meditative practices, as I moved away from raves and parties and turned inward. 


More recently Ive taken to social tripping again but only with close friends in semi-controlled settings (ie like my hike today), with some of my more benign allies, in attempts to forge connections and ideas which are otherwise less likely.


Recreational trips have been few and far between, unless of course, we count all those edibles. But imo theres nothing wrong with these either.. But i digress


Currently i feel so cleansed. Stripped of the stresses of these past few months (lord knows there was plenty) and ready to start anew. 


I look forward to working more with this material as I again incorporate psychedelics into a healthy lifestyle (previously i had put these activities on hold as life went the way it does sometimes and i fell back into escapism through alcohol).

I feel you man...

Life is a roller-coaster - always going up and down, and when we're down, we resort to what keeps us "on hold" - for me its weed and stimulants but I'm cutting with the latter more and more.


I'm very happy we have these tryptamines somewhat available nowadays to help us around those hard life's issues. 4-HO-DET is definitely a good one in these terms.

is this one more inclined for generally inducing "psychedelic soup" state, i.e. ego dissolution/ immersed in oblivion? seems a few people report that 4-ho-det is that, while most others dont seem to report much deepness.

For me it is. Both 4-HO-DET and 4-AcO-DET are pretty serious and quite deep for me, often leaving me recharged and "resetted".


But I can see how people might perceive it as shallow - IMO it will happen  with many psychedelics if you simply expect hedonistic euphoria or giggles with friends. 


Both 4-HO-DET and 4-AcO-DET will reward you greatly if you perform a ritual beforehand or something that will get your attention away from the daily noise and direct it inside.


It also has a great anti-addiction properties for me by bringing all the dark corners of my personality up to the light of consciousness.

They are distinguishable to me as in the ACO isn't anywhere how stimulated this one can get. Otherwise that's good info. 14-20mg is an alright medium dose, I hear the people who say take more than 40mg etc...I imagine that the stimulation is just that the 4-HO-DET is keeping you on the edge of a maybe unwanted ++++ but often once you get to ++++ physical symptoms are not really something one can really give much thought to. But to be safe, I say go with 15mg the first time, if you want to see if you like how it pushes you into the whole reason for psychedelics, ego death and a clean rebirth, that's why I only use them a couple times a year after I got older than 30. Although, I could imagine this one to be possible to consider a party drug, like say 5-meo-mipt (never take more than 10mg of that, but 5-substituted T's suck for the most part anyway), having beers and smoking some weed with it and doing whatever you like to party with people on the same wavelength could be nice, like half a hit of acid to get you a funky but still manageable socially experience. Group tripping when everything is right is amazing and that's why lysergamides remain my favourite for that reason, now that 2c-X are illegal up here because of fucking nbomes..anyway, a low-medium dose in a party type setting might bring in some energy and "positivity" to a group of people that know each other well. 


I have yet to try a dosage higher than -23mg, which I did last year, and yeah, I felt the stimulation go away and no strange heart sensations (please be in shape before you take anything that's a stimulant or has stimulant properties, sometimes you can't be like "oh it's just anxiety", but often it just is. I got heavy CVE's after taking a hit of hash on 23mg, it was pretty pleasant, especially that it seemed like I could steer the imagery and not be forced (like shrooms do to me, its close cousin, psilocin is doing) into themes I did not feel like exploring (shrooms when taken where you have to stay inside is kind of a sacrilege though, my only bad times with them is when I couldn't be outdoors in like at least a public park at night or even better, the top of a little mountain in town where one of those big red antennas that have a red flash are. where you can sit on a wall and the other side has a slightly safe area but you better no go there, too dangerous, because when you sit there tripping balls, it looks like you see a huge part of town like if it was a model,  and on a cloudless night is my favourite types of places to be shrooms, winter seems like it won't go away this year so I might be skipping a fresh batch from my local mycologist...thankfully I have a buttload of this...it is the second most stimulation inducing tryptamine I've had since aMT, but I really loved aMT and its 2 phases where they act like completely different type of drugs, so if you can handle aMT fine, you'll enjoy this one.

just looked at my stuff and although I cant recall the last time I looked but it is now significantly darker than when I acquired it ~5 years ago ... 

Ive only sampled once or twicethough so I cant say if its remained equipotent or has degraded but iirc moringglory (?or someone similar said it should be fine)... I will likely try it in the coming months

4-ho-det....I was trying to remember untill i eventually looked at my list....I only have tried 4-aco-det so far. Not that I remember a few experiences of so many years ago but what would the possible difference be? If any, just like 4-aco-dipt and 4-ho-dipt had as far as i could sense no real difference. it's fun, sure. but interesting enough for a temporarily humanoid looking for new experiences?

Some people seem to process the AcOs into their HO counterparts pretty quickly, seemingly before they can cross the BBB, so for those people the two have very little difference.  Whereas some people seem to process them slower so that more of the AcO ester crosses the BBB unchanged to produce unique effects.  For me, for example, 4-HO-DiPT and 4-AcO-DiPT are quite different (though also much the same), same for 4-HO-DMT and 4-AcO-DMT (these are the most different pair to me from each other).  My guess would be that you will find them basically the same.  Personally I have only tried 4-HO-DET so I can't comment on my perception of the differences.

I have some 4 HO DET and 4 AcO DET. I'm thinking of having a social trip tomorrow night. Which one of these would you guys go for? I'm leaning towards the HO. From what I read it seems to be a tad weaker then the other 4 subs, and one of my family members who has tested it agrees. 


How are they recreationally compared to 4 HO MET or ALD 52? ( The 2 most recreational in my collection in my opinion)


I also recently came into over 3000 mgs of 4 AcO DET as the price was very low. Substantially less then I would pay for 2000 mgs of 4 AcO DMT or 4 HO MET so I decided to grab it. I'm hoping i don't regret the purchase

4-ho-det would be far more ideal for a social for situations and recreational use; it's very euphoric and colorful; 4-aco-det feels darker and more spiritual better for a personal trip.

Found 25mgs to be a good sweet spot for a nice strong trip; took me allot further than 150ugs of al-lad but the trip lasted shorter. Only had 4-ho-met once but found 20-25mg to be about the same in terms of strength also the trip was overall similar.

Found drinking 4-ho-det dissolved in a glass of water was the best way to take it since it'll peak within 15mins.


You may want to go lower than 25mgs if you just want a chill with some friends.

I tried it a couple of times and for some reason I find this chemical very sexual. I kept seeing visuals that were related to my fetishes and sex in general. At times it was quite unpleasant trying to rethinking your life but see hardcore lesbian sex instead. Besides that, I'd say it's more similar to acid rather than to shrooms, weird.

I used to combine this 50/50 with methoxetamine and then inject the combo IV. Maybe 30mg of each. 


That was intense!! What a fucking trip!! Talk about being floored instantaneously! Whoa!!


I got busted by my ex wife and mom doing these mixed shots after they left me at home on home incarceration all day on Thanksgiving a few years ago.

4-HO-DET opens the gate to hell, though it's not the only one.
