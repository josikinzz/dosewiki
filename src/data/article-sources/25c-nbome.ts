**25C-NBOMe can be fatal at heavy doses (as low as 4mg).^[1] It is strongly discouraged to take large amounts of this substance or to snort it.**

*25C-NBOMe* or *2C-C-NBOMe* is a serotonergic N-benzyl derivative of the substituted phenethylamine psychedelic known as 2C-C.

It has nearly no history of human use prior to 2010 when it first became popular due its ease of purchase from online research chemical vendors.

25C-NBOMe was discovered in 2003 by Ralf Heim at the Free University of Berlin, it differs from 2C-C structurally through a substitution on the amine (NH2) with a 2-methoxybenzyl (BOMe) group as shown in the image above. This change in structure results in roughly a sixteen fold increase in potency when compared to 2C-C, allowing even the most extreme of dosages to fit in liquid form onto tabs and blotter paper (which people often mistake for LSD).

There are, however, methods of differentiating between LSD and adulterants like 25-C-NBOMe with and without test kits.

For example, one of the key differences between 25C-NBOMe and LSD is that this substance is only active when taken through a sublingual or insufflated route. This means that in order to get the full effects, 25C-NBOMe blotter paper must be lightly chewed on within the mouth for 10 - 20 minutes and never immediately swallowed.

Insufflation, however, is not recommended due to the amount of people who have suffered through dangerous and often fatal overdoses due to this route of administration.

The 25C-NBOMe experience contains a complex and wide array of effects which based on the predefined potential subjective effects index found [here](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effects_index), I will now begin to breakdown and describe.

**Physical effects:**

The physical effects of 25C-NBOMe can be broken down into six components all of which progressively intensify proportional to dosage. These are described below and generally include:**
**

- **Sublingual numbing** - assuming the substance has been taken sublingually, the very first physical effect which a person will notice immediately after sublingual absorption is a strong, unpleasant metallic chemical taste. This is accompanied by a very obvious feeling of general numbness of the tongue and mouth which can stay for up to an hour after the blotter paper has been consumed. This is the key difference when it comes to determining whether your blotter paper contains LSD or one of the NBOMe series.
- **Spontaneous tactile sensations** - the body high itself can be described as a generally mild, all-encompassing, soft but euphoric tingling sensation. This tingling sensation is also accompanied by spontaneous rushes of euphoria that become longer and more drawn out proportional to the dosage consumed.
- **Decreased bodily weight** - in terms of the body’s perceived weight, this substance consistently leaves people feeling extremely light, often to the point of total weightlessness.
- **Stimulation** - in terms of its effects on the physical energy levels of the tripper, 25C-NBOMe is usually considered to be energetic and stimulating, but it can be considered less stimulating when compared to 25I-NBOMe. For most people, this substance induces a unique type of physical stimulation which can be described as feeling extremely energetic but in a way which does not force the tripper to move unless they genuinely choose to do so. For others however, the stimulation can be quite uncontrollable, occasionally resulting in bodily shakes and a grinding of the teeth comparable to that of MDMA and traditional stimulants such as amphetamine, but this is manifested much less consistently when compared to 25I-NBOMe
- **Vasoconstriction** - it is worth noting that an undetermined percentage of people who experiment with this drug will experience negative physical side effects, such as a temporary difficulty in urinating and vasoconstriction. This is defined as the narrowing of the blood vessels resulting from contraction of the muscular wall of the vessels and is triggered through the way in which 25I-NBOMe’s target receptor (5-HT2A) modulates both vasoconstriction and vasodilation among its many other functions.
- **Nausea** - as the tripper begins to come up, nausea is not uncommon and can sometimes result in initial vomiting, but passes once this has either happened or the trip begins to fully set in. In comparison to other psychedelics such as psilocin, LSD, 2C-E and 2C-I, this could actually be very considered very mild in its intensity.

**Cognitive effects:**

The head space of 25C-NBOMe is described by many as remarkably light and underwhelming in comparison to the classical psychedelics. It is not uncommon for people to report feeling that their thought stream has maintained general normality in its specific style throughout low to moderate dosages. At high dosages, however, mild to overwhelming cognitive alterations become present; this dosage seems to be lower in proportion to physical effects when compared to 25I-NBOMe.
The most prominent of these cognitive effects generally include:

- **Introspection** - this component is consistently manifested only in the context of a non-social setting in which the user is alone.
- **Increased empathy, love and sociability** - the entactogenic effects range from mild to powerful, but are inconsistently manifested. Entactogenic effects for people who try this substance usually become prominent in the presence of others. These feelings of increased sociability, love and empathy do not seem to be quite as strong or profound as those found within other entactogens (such as MDMA, 2C-B and AMT)
- **Acceleration of thought**
- **Time distortion**
- **Feelings of fascination, importance and awe**
- **Conceptual thinking**
- **Connectivity of thought**
- **Enhancement of current mind state**
- **Removal of cultural filter**
- **Ego suppression, loss and death**

**Visual effects:**

*Enhancements*

25C-NBOMe presents a full and complete array of possible visual enhancements which generally include:

- **Increased visual acuity**
- **Enhancement of colours**
- **Enhanced pattern recognition**

*Distortions*

The visual distortions and alterations which are experienced are detailed below:

- **Visual drifting** (*melting, flowing, breathing and morphing*) - In comparison to other psychedelics, this effect can be described as highly detailed, slow and smooth in motion, static in their appearance and unrealistic/cartoon like in style.
- **Tracers**
- **After images**
- **Texture repetition** - In comparison to other psychedelics such as LSD or psilocin, this particular visual alteration is significantly more basic and less intricate in style but still distinctively present and seems more intricate in comparison to 25I-NBOMe.

*Geometry*

The visual geometry that is present throughout this trip is often described as very similar in appearance to that of LSD. They can be comprehensively described as algorithmic in geometric style, intricate in complexity, fine and zoomed out in detail, fast and smooth in motion, structured in shape, colourful in scheme, glossy in colour, sharp around the edges and mostly rounded across their corners. In comparison to other more commonly used psychedelics, they can be described as significantly more intricate than the visual geometry found within 2C-I and most of the 2C-x family in general as well as completely on par with LSD, psilocin and DMT at appropriately high dosages (which seem lower in proportion to the accompanying physical effects when compared to that of 25I-NBOMe).

In terms of their behaviour, 25C-NBOMe’s geometry leads onto Level 7A visual geometry with Level 7B remaining so far unconfirmed within this substance. They also seem to consistently build up in visual intensity when the tripper stares at a central point. This eventually envelops the visual field and creates the sensation that the tripper has broken through into a continuously shifting geometric landscape or structure with a vast sense of immersive physical size attributed to it.

*Hallucinatory states*

25C-NBOMe is capable of producing a full range of hallucinatory states within the level 1 - 3 range extremely consistently. However, level 4 hallucinatory breakthroughs are reported but very uncommon and inconsistent in comparison to other more commonly used psychedelics such as psilocin, 2C-E and DMT. This can be considered as on par with and identical in behaviour to that of LSD and 25I-NBOMe.
These effects include:

- **External hallucinations**
- **Internal hallucinations** - this particular effect commonly contains hallucinations within scenarios, settings, concepts and autonomous entity contact. They are more common within dark environments and can be described as internal in their manifestation, lucid in believability, interactive in style and almost exclusively of religious, spiritual, mystical or a transcendental nature in their overall theme.

**Auditory effects:**

The auditory effects of 25C-NBOMe are common in their occurrence and exhibit a full range of effects which commonly includes:

- **Enhancements**
- **Distortions**
- **Hallucinations**

**Health effects, addiction potential and tolerance:**

25C-NBOMe is a very new substance and little is known about its pharmacological or behavioural risks. The LD50 is not known. Some deaths have been attributed to 25C-NBOMe overdose caused by improper handling and uneducated use of this substance. Its recent widespread use suggests that death is primarily caused from overdoses and not from ordinary doses, particularly from insufflation.

The fact that 25C-NBOMe is active in the microgram range is likely a contributing factor since this makes measuring doses significantly more difficult.

It’s worth noting that although many 5-HT2A agonists have documented safety, none of these have been full agonists so their safety data cannot be applied to 25C-NBOMe.

In terms of its addictive potential, 25C-NBOMe has not been studied formally but due to its immediate tolerance build up which lasts up to 2 - 3 weeks after the experience, it is essentially impossible to use this substance compulsively.

**Legal Issues:**

- **UK:** The 25x-NBOMe series is under a temporary class drug order, lasting one year from 10th June 2013.
- **USA:** On Nov 15, 2013, the DEA added 25C-NBOMe to Schedule I using their emergency scheduling powers, making it “temporarily” in Schedule I for 2 years

**Conclusion:**

The subjective effects breakdown contained within this article was written and contributed by the PsychonautWiki admin known as [cocoanatta](http://encyclopediapsychonautica.org/index.php?title=User:Cocoanatta).

As for the substance itself, 25C-NBOMe  and the NBOMe series as a whole are an extremely interesting set of psychedelics but do not quite compare in terms of hallucinatory and cognitive depth if you have access to classical psychedelics such as genuine LSD, DMT and psilocin.

DESCRIPTION #
 
General Effects Notes
 2C-C-NBOMe is chemically related to [2C-C](https://erowid.org/chemicals/2cc/) and is a very potent 5HT2A agonist with active doses in the 200-700 microgram range. Its effects have been compared to 2C-C and LSD. There are some reports that effects can be very unpredictable, even with the same person taking the same dose at different times. 
 
 There have been several reports of users of 25C-NBOMe and 25I-NBOMe experienced peripheral vasocontriction that required medical attention. Symptoms begin with tingling, coldness, bluing, and numbness in the fingers, toes, lips, nose, and other extremities. Swelling in the hands, feet, and face have been reported. One user reported numbness lasting more than a week after use. 
Addiction and Compulsive Use
 Though some reports mention that re-dosing is possible, compulsive use seems unlikely. However, because its use is so new and uncommon, no definitive statements about it can yet be made.
 
EXPERIENCE EXCERPTS #
 
[500 mcg, insufflated] "The unremarkable room I'm in is suddenly transfigured into a Van-Goghian masterpiece. Looking out the window, the world has come alive, flowing in wavy brushstrokes. Visual trails leave clearly discernible ribbons of color in the air. I am completely enraptured by the stunning visual effects. My entire sensory experience takes on full salience. Every sight, sound, and smell enters my conscious awareness with unfiltered vitality." -- [Exp 90724](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=90724)
 
[1.4 mg, insufflated] "I realized the moment I stepped into the next room that things were warped and wrong, no way I could vape. I glanced at the clock, and less than 4 minutes had taken place since insufflation. I was already becoming overwhelmed with confusion and slight delirium, I knew by the unnaturally immediate and incredibly strong onset that the 'Effective' dose I had given myself was much, much, much greater than anything I had ever gotten before." -- [Exp 88985](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=88985)

2C-C-NBOMe
 
Dose
 
by Erowid
 
DOSAGE DESCRIPTION #
 
Caution : Dose information should not be taken as recommendations. [ see below ]
 
**2C-C-NBOMe Dosages**
**Insufflated**
- Threshold: 25 - 50 ug
- Light: 75 - 250 ug
- Common: 250 - 500 ug
- Strong: 500 - 700 ug
 
 
2C-C-NBOMe is most commonly found in powder form, but is also mixed into liquid as well as dropped onto blotter paper (due to its extremely low doses). We have very few reports of 2C-C-NBOMe usage, so dosages and durations are not well known. Some blotter reportedly contains 400 ug on each perforated hit.
 
NOTES #
 
Due to its potency, misjudging the dose of 2C-C-NBOMe carries very real risks. A substantial dosage error could lead to undesirable or dangerous effects. If 2C-C-NBOMe is in in pure powder form, small breezes, accidental inhalation, or touching the eyes or mouth after handling could result in full-blown effects or dangerous overdoses. Because of these dangers, 2C-C-NBOMe powder should be labeled clearly and handled with laboratory methods (goggles, gloves, mask) to minimize risks.
 
CAUTION & DISCLAIMER #
 
Every individual reacts differently to every chemical. 
 
 Erowid's dosage information is a summary of data gathered from users, research, and other resources. This information is intended to describe the range of dosages people report using. It should not be construed as a recommendation of any sort. Individuals can respond very differently to the same dosage. What is safe for one can be deadly for another.

2C-C-NBOMe
 
Legal Status
 
by Erowid
 
U.S. FEDERAL LAW #
 
Caution : All legal information should be verified through other sources. [ see below ]
 
**U.S. FEDERAL LEGAL SUMMARY**
**2C-C-NBOMe**
- REGULATED: Yes
- STATUS: Scheduled
- SCHEDULE: I
 
On Nov 13, 2015, the DEA extended the emergency scheduling of 25I-, 25C-, and 25B-NBOMe by one year, until Nov 2016. 
 
 On Nov 15, 2013, the DEA added 25I-, 25C-, and 25B-NBOMe to Schedule I using their emergency scheduling powers, making those NBOMe compounds "temporarily" in Schedule I for two years. It is nearly guaranteed that after two years, these will be permanently added to Schedule I. Having these three chemicals in Schedule I also makes the rest of the NBOMe series probable [Controlled Substance Analogues](https://erowid.org/psychoactives/law/analog/analog.shtml) when intended for human consumption. For these three compounds sales, possession, manufacture, and distribution are all crimes under US law. 
 
 One technical note about 25-*-NBOMe legal status: The primary (easiest) synthetic route for producing 25I-, 25C-, and 25B-NBOMe uses the related controlled substance (2C-I, 2C-C, and 2C-B, respectively) as the precursor chemical. It is likely that NBOMe-compounds sourced from lower-end sources might contain tiny, detectable amounts of a controlled substance. Depending on amount and legal venue, that trace amount could affect the legality of the whole batch.

It is strongly discouraged to take large amounts of this substance or to [insufflate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Routes_of_administration#Insufflation) (snort) it. Please see [this section](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25C-NBOMe#Toxicity_and_harm_potential) for more details.
**25C-NBOMe** (also known as **Cimbi-82** , **NBOMe-2C-C** and **2C-C-NBOMe** ) is a novel [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) substance of the [phenethylamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamine) class. It is a member of the 25x-NBOMe series, a recently discovered group of potent psychedelic compounds derived from the [2C-x](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-x) family.

The name 25C-NBOMe, which is short-hand for 2C-C-NBOMe, is a derivative of the phenethylamine psychedelic [2C-C](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-C) . It was discovered in 2003 by Ralf Heim at the Free University of Berlin, and subsequently investigated by a team at Purdue University led by [David Nichols](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/David_E._Nichols) . It has been studied in its radiolabelled form as a potential ligand for mapping the distribution of serotonin-2A receptors in the brain using positron emission tomography (PET). The first reports of human use appeared in 2010 following its appearance on the online [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) market.

[Subjective effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effects) include [stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation) , [open and closed-eye visuals](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Geometry) , [time distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Time_distortion) , [euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Euphoria) , and [ego loss](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ego_loss) . 25C-NBOMe's effects are sometimes compared to those of [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) or [DOx](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DOx) . However, it is reported to have stronger visual effects and less cognitive and emotional effects like [ego loss](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ego_loss) and [introspection](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Introspection) . Additionally, 25C-NBOMe is reported to be considerably more stimulating than other psychedelics. Serious side effects are more common and include [nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea) , [muscle tension](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_tension) , [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , cardiovascular effects, and [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) .

It is worth noting that members of the [NBOMe](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25x-NBOMe) series are not [orally](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Orally) active and should be administered [sublingually](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sublingual) (by holding it into one's mouth and allowing it to absorb over a period of 15 minutes). 25C-NBOMe can also be vaporized and inhaled for more rapid and powerful effects and a shorter duration. However, this route of administration is highly advised against due to the difficulties of measuring and handling substances that are active in the microgram range as it significantly increases the risk of overdose. 25C-NBOMe is also sometimes sold as a counterfeit version of LSD due to its similar effects and ability to be laid onto blotter paper.

Very little is known about the pharmacological properties, metabolism, and toxicity of 25C-NBOMe. However, it has been associated with many deaths and hospitalizations which suggests that it has a significantly worse toxicity profile than classical psychedelics like [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) or [psilocybin mushrooms](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocybin_mushrooms) . Along with its highly sensitive dose-response and unpredictable effects, many reports also suggest that this substance may be overly difficult to use safely. It is highly advised to use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Harm_reduction_practices) if using this substance.

## Chemistry

25C-NBOMe or 2C-C-NBOMe is a serotonergic N-benzyl derivative of the substituted phenethylamine psychedelic known as [2C-C](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-C) . 25C-NBOMe is a substituted phenethylamine with methoxy groups CH 3 O- attached to carbons R 2 and R 5 as well as a chlorine atom attached to carbon R 4 . It differs from 2C-C structurally through a substitution on the amine (NH2) with a 2-methoxybenzyl (BOMe) group as shown in the image to the right. 25C-NBOMe shares this 2-methoxybenzyl substitution with other chemicals of the NBOMe family. This NBOMe addition contains a methoxy ether CH 3 O- bound to a benzene ring at R 2 .

## Pharmacology

25C-NBOMe has efficacy at the [5-HT2A receptor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin#The_5-HT_system) where it acts as a potent [partial agonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist#Agonists) . However, the role of these interactions and how they result in the [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) experience continues to remain elusive.

In comparison to [2C-C](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-C) , the addition of an NBOMe group to the structure results in a sixteen fold increase in potency, allowing even the most extreme of dosages to fit in liquid form onto tabs and blotter paper, which people often mistake for [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) . In comparison to LSD however it is only a third of the potency.

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)** - 25C-NBOMe is considered to be very energetic and stimulating. The physical stimulation manifested by this substance can be described as similar to [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) , and is commonly experienced as simultaneously easygoing and physically difficult, sometimes presenting overstimulation which results in bodily shakes and teeth grinding. The levels of stimulation are reported to be more intense than classical psychedelics but less intense than [25I-NBOMe](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25I-NBOMe) , of which it is described as mildly sedating by comparison.
- **[Mouth numbing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mouth_numbing)** - Assuming the substance has been taken [sublingually](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sublingual) , the very first physical effect which a user will notice is a strong, unpleasant metallic chemical taste. This is accompanied by a very obvious feeling of general numbness of the tongue and mouth which can stay for up to an hour after the blotter paper has been consumed. This is the key difference when it comes to determining whether one's blotter paper contains LSD or one of the NBOMe series.
- **[Temperature regulation suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Temperature_regulation_suppression)**
- **[Spontaneous bodily sensations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_bodily_sensations)** - The "body high" itself can be described as a generally mild, all-encompassing, soft but euphoric tingling sensation. This tingling sensation is also accompanied by spontaneous rushes of euphoria that become longer and more drawn out proportional to the dosage consumed.
- **[Perception of bodily lightness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perception_of_bodily_lightness)** - In terms of the body’s perceived weight, this substance consistently leaves people feeling extremely light, often to the point of total weightlessness.
- **[Tactile hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_hallucination)**
- **[Changes in felt gravity](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Changes_in_felt_gravity)** - Compared to classic [tryptamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tryptamines) , this effect is considerably less intense than what is commonly experienced with [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT) and [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) .
- **[Nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea)** - As the user begins to come up, nausea is not uncommon and can sometimes result in initial vomiting, but passes once this has either happened or the trip begins to fully set in. In comparison to other [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) such as [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) , [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) , [2C-E](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-E) and [2C-I](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-I) , this could actually be very considered very mild in its intensity.

#### Geometry
 
25C-NBOMe visual geometry is often described as very similar in appearance to that of [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) . They can be comprehensively described as algorithmic in geometric style, intricate in complexity, fine and zoomed out in detail, fast and smooth in motion, structured in shape, colourful in scheme, glossy in colour, sharp around the edges and mostly rounded across their corners. In comparison to other more commonly used psychedelics, they can be described as significantly more intricate than the visual geometry found within [2C-I](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-I) and most of the [2C-x](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-x) family in general as well as completely on par with [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) , [Psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) and [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT) at appropriately high dosages, which seem lower in proportion to the accompanying physical effects when compared to that of [25I-NBOMe](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25I-NBOMe) .
 
The behavior of 25C-NBOMe geometry leads to [Level 8A](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Level_8A) visual geometry with [Level 8B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Level_8B) remaining so far unconfirmed within this substance. They also seem to consistently build up in visual intensity when the user stares at a central point. This eventually envelopes the visual field and creates the sensation that the user has broken through into a continuously shifting geometric landscape or structure with a vast sense of immersive physical size attributed to it.
 
#### Hallucinatory states
 
25C-NBOMe is capable of producing a full range of hallucinatory states within the level 1 - 3 range extremely consistently. However, level 4 - 5 [hallucinatory breakthroughs](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucinations) are reported but very uncommon and inconsistent in comparison to other more commonly used psychedelics such as [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) , [2C-E](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-E) and [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT) . This can be considered as on par with and identical in behaviour to that of [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) and [25I-NBOMe](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25I-NBOMe) .
 
These effects include:
 
- **[Transformations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Transformations)**
- **[Internal hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucination)** - ( *[autonomous entities](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Autonomous_entities)* ; *[settings, sceneries, and landscapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Settings,_sceneries,_and_landscapes)* ; *[perspective hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perspective_hallucinations)* and *[scenarios and plots](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenarios_and_plots)* ) These are more common within dark environments and can be described as internal in their manifestation, lucid in believability, interactive in style and almost exclusively of a personal, religious, spiritual, science-fiction, fantasy, surreal, nonsensical or transcendental nature in their overall theme.
- **[External hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/External_hallucination)** - ( *[autonomous entities](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Autonomous_entities)* ; *[settings, sceneries, and landscapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Settings,_sceneries,_and_landscapes)* ; *[perspective hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perspective_hallucinations)* and *[scenarios and plots](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenarios_and_plots)* ). These are often manifesting as rapidly moving, interactive solid and typically asymmetrical matter or physical beings reflecting imagined concepts. They are more common in bright environments and can be described as external in their manifestation, equally lucid and delirious in believability, interactive in style, autonomous in interaction, and almost exclusively alien, mystical, or a transcendental nature in their overall theme. ### Cognitive effects
 
- The cognitive effects of 25C-NBOMe are commonly described as being notably light and underwhelming in comparison to more traditional [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) . It is not uncommon for user to report feeling that their thought stream has maintained a normality in style throughout low to moderate dosages. At high dosages, however, mild to overwhelming cognitive alterations become present; this dosage seems to be lower in proportion to physical effects when compared to [25I-NBOMe](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25I-NBOMe) . 
- **[Analysis enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Analysis_enhancement)** - This effect is generally only present at low doses.
- **[Thought acceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_acceleration)** and **[Thought deceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_deceleration)** - Although one of 25C-NBOME's effects is thought acceleration, the opposite may occur at higher doses.
- **[Conceptual thinking](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Conceptual_thinking)** - This effect is considered to be very mild compared to traditional psychedlics.
- **[Anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety)** & **[Paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia)** - This effect seems to occur more readily than other psychedelics, perhaps due to its very prominent stimulating properties
- **[Feelings of impending doom](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Feelings_of_impending_doom)** - This is generally only experienced during the comedown period or if one has taken a large amount of the substance.
- **[Empathy, affection, and sociability enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Empathy,_affection,_and_sociability_enhancement)** - The [entactogenic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entactogenic) effects range from mild to powerful, but are inconsistently manifested. Entactogenic effects for people who try this substance usually become prominent in the presence of others. These feelings of increased sociability, love and empathy do not seem to be quite as strong or profound as those found within other [entactogens](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entactogen) (such as [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) , [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) and [AMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/AMT) )

- **[Hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_hallucinations)** ### Multi-sensory effects
 
- - **[Dosage independent intensity](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dosage_independent_intensity)** - While the reasons for this are not understood, many reports suggest that this substance can produce unexpectedly strong or weak effects even when taken at the seemingly same dose in an unpredictable manner. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] This may contribute to the relative risk it is poses compared to most other psychedelics.
- **[Synaesthesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Synaesthesia)** - In its fullest manifestation, this is a very rare and non-reproducible effect. Increasing the dosage can increase the likelihood of this occurring, but seems to only be a prominent part of the experience among those who are already predisposed to synaesthetic states. ### Transpersonal effects
 
- Transpersonal effects on 25C-NBOMe are thought to occur with less frequency than classical psychedelics such as [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) , [psilocybin mushrooms](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocybin_mushrooms) , and [mescaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mescaline) .

## Toxicity and harm potential

25C-NBOMe is a relatively new substance, and little is known about its pharmacological risks or its interaction with other substances. The [LD50](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LD50) has not yet been determined although it can be fatal at heavy dosages.

It is advised that due to 25C-NBOMe's extreme potency it should not be insufflated (snorted) as this method of administration has been attributed to several fatal overdoses due to improper dosing.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this substance.

### Dependence and abuse potential

25C-NBOMe is not habit-forming, and the desire to use it can actually decrease with use. It is most often self-regulating.

Tolerance to the effects of 25C-NBOMe is built almost immediately after ingestion. After that, it takes about 7 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 14 days to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). 25C-NBOMe presents cross-tolerance with all [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) , meaning that after the consumption of 25C-NBOMe all psychedelics will have a reduced effect.

### Overdose

Due to the very high potency and seemingly unpredictable effects the margin between a normal and an overdose of NBOMe compounds is extremely small when compared to many other substances. The exact toxic dose is unclear since it seems to depend a lot on personal physiology, rather than predominantly dose. However, various anecdotal reports suggest that dangerous side effects begin to appear when exceeding 1000 μg and it possibly becoming lethal for the more sensitive people at roughly 2000 μg. Reports of other people surviving much higher doses, sometimes even without any major side effects have been documented as well.

There is also the uncertainty of dosage on blotter paper since it is rather difficult to lay such an exact dosage. Insufflating, vaporizing or drinking tinctures of this substance is highly discouraged because of this and has been tied to many documented deaths . One study found that 25I‐NBOMe and 25C‐NBOMe blotter papers contained 'hotspots' with higher quantities of the drug, implying an inherent risk of overdosing.

The overdose effects of NBOMes are typically a dangerously high [heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate) , [blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure) , [hyperthermia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hyperthermia) and significant [vasoconstriction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction) also accompanied by [confusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Confusion) , [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attack) , aggressive behavior, [numbness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_suppression) or pain, [amnesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amnesia) and often [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizure) . The risks in an overdose include anything from organ failure to cardiac arrest and death [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] . There are also multiple reports of people lethally injuring themselves or falling to death . [Benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) or [antipsychotics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antipsychotics) can help with the psychological effects during an overdose although medical attention should always be called in even a possible overdose of 25I-NBOMe.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .* Due to the highly unpredictable nature of the NBOMe series, it is generally advised to avoid mixing them with other psychoactive substances.

- **2C-T-X** - The 2C-T-X phenethylamines can be unpredictable in their interactions and the NBOMes are known to be unpredictable even alone. As a result, this combination should be avoided.
- **5-MeO-xxt** - The 5-MeO tryptamines can be unpredictable in their interactions and the NBOMes are known to be unpredictable even alone. As a result, this combination should be avoided.
- **Amphetamines** - Amphetamines and NBOMes both provide considerable stimulation. When combined they can result in tachycardia, hypertension, vasoconstriction and, in extreme cases, heart failure. The anxiogenic and focusing effects of stimulants are also not good in combination with psychedelics as they can lead to unpleasant thought loops. NBOMes are known to cause seizures and stimulants can increase this risk.
- **aMT**
- **Caffeine** - Caffeine can bring out the natural stimulation from psychedelic drugs to make it uncomfortable. High doses can cause anxiety which is hard to handle while tripping.
- **Cannabis** - Cannabis has an unexpectedly strong and unpredictable synergy with the effects of psychedelics. Caution is advised with this combination as it can significantly increase the risk of adverse psychological reactions like [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) , and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) . Users are advised to start off with only a fraction of their normal cannabis dose and take long breaks between hits to avoid over intake.
- **Cocaine** - Cocaine and NBOMes both provide considerable stimulation. When combined they can result in severe vasoconstriction, tachycardia, hypertension, and in extreme cases heart failure.
- **DOx**
- **DXM**
- **[Lithium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_(medication))** [- Lithium is commonly prescribed in the treatment of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder bipolar disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_(medication)) . There is a large body of anecdotal evidence that suggests taking it with psychedelics significantly increases the risk of [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) and [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) . As a result, this combination is strictly discouraged.
- **MAOIs** - MAO-B inhibitors can increase the potency and duration of phenethylamines unpredictably.
- **MDMA**
- **MXE** - As an NMDA antagonist, MXE potentiates NBOMes which can be unpleasantly intense.
- **Tramadol** - Tramadol is well known to lower seizure threshold and NBOMes have also shown a tendency to cause severe seizures

25C-NBOMe, also known as NBOMe-2C-C, 2C-C-NBOMe, or Cimbi-82, is a psychedelic drug and derivative of the psychedelic phenethylamine 2C-C. It acts as a potent agonist of the 5-HT2A receptor, and has been studied in its 11C radiolabelled form as a potential ligand for mapping the distribution of 5-HT2A receptors in the brain, using positron emission tomography (PET). Multiple deaths have occurred from usage of 25C-NBOMe due to the ease of accidental overdose. The long-term toxic effects of the drug have not been researched. 25C-NBOMe was first described in the scientific literature by 2010.

## Use and effects

25C-NBOMe is extremely potent and the effects of the drug increase greatly within a small window of dose adjustment. Overdose may occur at as little as double an average dose. With inaccurate dosing of street blotter paper, when mistaken for LSD, or when taken as a powder or liquid, this has resulted in multiple accidental deaths.
One study has shown that 25C-NBOMe blotters have 'hotspots' of the drug and the dose is not evenly applied over the surface of the paper, which could lead to overdose. Sublingually, the threshold for the onset of hallucinogenic effects reportedly is about 100–250 μg, with mild effects at 250–450, strong effects at 450–800, and very strong effects over 800 μg.
NBOMe-substituted compounds have a diminished absorption rate passing through mucous membranes, but generally remain inactive when taken orally. Buccal, sublingual or insufflated routes of administration are all viable options. Absorption rate buccally and sublingually can be increased when complexed with HPBCD complexing sugar, however the most efficient is nasal administration, which shortens the duration while increasing intensity, but has been attributed to several overdoses and deaths.

## Toxicity and harm potential

### Neurotoxic and cardiotoxic actions

### Emergency treatment

## Interactions

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

25C-NBOMe acts as a serotonin 5-HT2 receptor agonist, including of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor.

## Chemistry

25C-NBOMe is derived from the psychedelic phenethylamine 2C-C by substitution on the amine with a 2-methoxybenzyl group. 25C-NBOMe is a clumpy white powder with a notably bitter and metallic taste.

### Analogues

Analogues of 25C-NBOMe include 2C-C, DOC, 25I-NBOMe, 25B-NBOMe, 25C-NBOH, 25C-NB3OMe, 25C-NB4OMe, and 25C-NBF, among others.

## History

25C-NBOMe was first described in the scientific literature by Anders Ettrup and colleagues by 2010.

## Society and culture

### Recreational use

25C-NBOMe has been found on blotter mimics sold as LSD.

### Legal status

#### Canada

As of October 31, 2016; 25C-NBOMe is a controlled substance (Schedule III) in Canada.

#### China

As of October 2015, 25C-NBOMe is a controlled substance in China.

#### Czech Republic

25C-NBOMe is banned in the Czech Republic.

#### Israel

The NBOMe series of psychoactives became controlled in Israel in May, 2013.

#### New Zealand

25C-NBOMe was sold as a designer drug in New Zealand in early 2012, but was withdrawn from sale after a statement by Associate Health Minister Peter Dunne that 25C-NBOMe would be considered to be substantially similar in chemical structure to the illegal hallucinogen DOB, and was therefore a Class C controlled drug analogue.

#### Russia

Russia became the first country to regulate the NBOME class. The entire NBOMe series of psychoactives became controlled in the Russian Federation starting October, 2011.

#### Sweden

Sveriges riksdag added 25C-NBOMe to schedule I ("substances, plant materials and fungi which normally do not have medical use") as narcotics in Sweden as of Aug 1, 2013, published by Medical Products Agency in their regulation LVFS 2013:15 listed as 25C-NBOMe 2-(4-kloro-2,5-dimetoxifenyl)-N-(2-metoxibensyl)etanamin.

#### United Kingdom

This substance is a Class A drug in the United Kingdom as a result of the N-benzylphenethylamine catch-all clause in the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971.

#### United States

Several NBOMe series compounds will be temporarily scheduled in the United States for 2 years. The temporary scheduling applies to 25C-NBOMe, 25B-NBOMe, and 25I-NBOMe. In November 2015, the temporary scheduling was extended for another year.
