## Dosage & Duration

### Oral

**Dosage:**
- Threshold: 100 mg
- Light: 250 - 500 mg
- Common: 500 - 800 mg
- Strong: 800 - 1200 mg
- Heavy: 1200 mg +

**Duration:**
- Total: 4 - 7 hours
- Onset: 30 - 90 minutes

**Pramiracetam** (also known as **Pramistar** ) is a [nootropic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nootropic) [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) of the [racetam](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Racetam) class. It is a derivative of [piracetam](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Piracetam) , which has been studied as a cognitive enhancing agent.

In parts of Europe, pramiracetam is marketed as a prescription drug by Menarini under the brand name Pramistar as a treatment for memory and attention deficits in aging people with neurodegenerative and vascular dementias. In the United States, it is readily available and sold through online vendors as a dietary supplement.

Pramiracetam is typically used at dosages of either 400mg thrice daily or 600mg twice daily; both of these dosing regimens totals 1,200mg of pramiracetam a day. It is unclear if pramiracetam should be taken with meals, and it is also unclear if 1,200mg is the optimal dosage or not as this may vary between individuals. Dosages range at nearly ten times of that of [noopept](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Noopept) , making it less potent while offering comparable benefit.

## Chemistry

Pramiracetam, or N-[2-(Diisopropylamino)ethyl]-2-(2-oxopyrrolidin-1-yl)acetamide, is a synthetic compound of the [racetam](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Racetam) family. Racetams share a [pyrrolidine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pyrrolidine) nucleus, a five member nitrogenous ring with a ketone bonded oxygen at R 2 . This 2-pyrrolidone ring is bound to the terminal carbon of an acetamide group, an ethyl amide chain with a ketone bond (C=O) at the alpha carbon. Pramiracetam features an additional substituion bonded to R N of the acetamide group of a ethyl amide chain with two isopropyl carbon chains attached to the terminal nitrogen.

Pramiracetam is structurally analogous to [piracetam](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Piracetam) with an added diisopropyl ethylamino chain. Pramiracetam is prepared from [piracetam](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Piracetam) by substituting the amide group with a dipropan-2-ylaminoethyl group.

## Pharmacology

The mechanism of pramiracetam is not well known, but it is thought to be able to enhance high-affinity [choline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Choline) uptake in a manner which is similar to other compounds of the [racetam](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Racetam) family. As choline is responsible for [acetylcholine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Acetylcholine) synthesis, this process essentially allows acetylcholine to accumulate at higher levels than that which it otherwise would. As acetycholine is involved in the function of memory, this could potentially account for its [nootropic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nootropic) effects.

## Subjective effects

In comparison to the effects of other nootropics such as [noopept](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Noopept) , pramiracetam can be described as focusing primarily on physical stimulation over that of cognitive stimulation.

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)** - Pramiracetam produces a subtle form of stimulation comparable to that of [caffeine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Caffeine) .
- **[Headaches](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Headaches)**
 
#### Sensory effects
 
Although these effects are not universal, certain people may experience sensory enhancements under the influence of pramiracetam.
 
- **[Acuity enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Acuity_enhancement)**
- **[Colour enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_enhancement)**
- **[Auditory enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_enhancement)**
- **[Tactile enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_enhancement)** ### Cognitive effects
 
- In terms of its cognitive effects, this compound can be described as a stimulating, mindful, and emotionally stable experience which is able to bring the user to a "neutral" level of emotional stability. 
- **[Emotion suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Emotion_suppression)** - Most prominent among its effects is its ability to bring the user to a mellow or emotionally dulled state. In comparison to other substances such as [quetiapine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Quetiapine) or [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine) , it manifests itself lucidly, rather than invoking carelessness or dulling thought.
- **[Wakefulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness)**
- **[Mindfulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mindfulness)**
- **[Anxiety suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety_suppression)**
- **[Thought connectivity](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_connectivity)**
- **[Focus enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Focus_enhancement)**
- **[Motivation enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motivation_enhancement)**
- **[Memory enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Memory_enhancement)**
- **[Dream potentiation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dream_potentiation)**
### Experience reports

There are currently no anecdotal reports which describe the effects of this compound within our [experience index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Experience_index) . Additional experience reports can be found here:

- [Erowid Experience Vaults: Pramiracetam](https://erowid.org/experiences/subs/exp_Pramiracetam.shtml)

## Toxicity and harm potential

The toxicity and long-term health effects of pramiracetam use do not seem to have been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dosage is unknown. This is because pramiracetam has very little history of human usage. Anecdotal evidence from people who have tried pramiracetam within the community suggest that there do not seem to be any negative health effects attributed to simply trying this drug at low to moderate doses by itself and using it sparingly (but nothing can be completely guaranteed).

There are anecdotal reports of users experiencing painful chemical burns caused by ingesting pramiracetam powder sublingually. Other routes of administration do not seem to cause the same effects.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this substance.

### Dependence and abuse potential

The chronic use of Pramiracetam can be considered as not addictive with a low potential for abuse. It does not seem to be capable of causing psychological dependence among certain users.

Tolerance to many of the effects of Pramiracetam develops with prolonged and repeated use. This results in users having to administer increasingly large doses to achieve the same effects. After that, it takes about 3 - 7 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 1 - 2 weeks to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). Pramiracetam may presents cross-tolerance with all [racetam](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Racetam) [nootropics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nootropic) , meaning that after the consumption of pramiracetam certain [nootropics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nootropics) such as [aniracetam](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Aniracetam) and [piracetam](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Piracetam) may have a reduced effect.

## Legal status

Pramiracetam is currently legally available to buy and sell in most countries, but this may vary by region.

- **United Kingdom:** Pramiracetam and other racetams are prescription only drugs; however, there is no penalty for possession or importing them.

Pramiracetam is a nootropic agent belonging to the racetam family of drugs.  It is marketed by Menarini under the brand name Pramistar as a treatment for memory and attention deficits in aging people with neurodegenerative and vascular dementias in Italy and some Eastern European countries.
Pramiracetam was discovered by scientists at Parke-Davis, at that time a division of Warner-Lambert, in the late 1970s; patents expired in 1996. Warner-Lambert conducted clinical trials in Alzheimer's Disease and abandoned that indication after Phase II trials showed mixed results; it then began to develop it as an orphan drug as an adjunct to electroconvulsive therapy for major depressive disorder, in part to take advantage of the administrative exclusivity provided by the orphan status.  It licensed European rights to Menarini which continued developing it for dementias, and in 1991 it licensed US and other non-European rights to Cambridge Neuroscience, Inc, (CNI) which pursued the ECT indication, as well as a use in restoring cognitive function after stroke or traumatic brain injury.  CNI obtained the orphan designation for the ECT use from the FDA in 1991, which was later withdrawn when CNI abandoned the drug.
CNI conducted a clinical trial in four people who had cognitive problems following a head injury.  Trials conducted by or on behalf of Menarini and Warner-Lambert included two small trials conducted in Ukraine, one in people with cerebrovascular disease and another in people with concussion.  Another small trial was performed in Italy, on healthy people in whom amnesia was induced with scopolamine.
