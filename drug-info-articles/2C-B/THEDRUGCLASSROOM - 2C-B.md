# 2C-B
*Source: https://thedrugclassroom.com/video/2c-b/*

2C-B is a psychedelic that was created in the 1970s. It’s a member of the 2C family ( [2C-E](http://thedrugclassroom.com/video/2c-e/) , [2C-I](http://thedrugclassroom.com/video/2c-i/) , etc) and along with having psychedelic effects, 2C-B has aphrodisiac qualities.

The sexual boost it offers occurs more with lower doses and it includes having your mind and body fill up with sexual feelings. An increase in pleasure from sexual activity has been reported.

Depending on the dose you use, 2C-B either offers largely body-centric and erotic effects or psychedelic effects.

While there hasn’t been much research into the drug and we don’t know how much can be used safely, it is considered one of the safer psychedelics. Using a common dose is still wise, however.
