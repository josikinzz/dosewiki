## SYNTHESIS
A mixture of 4.8 g POCl3 and 4.5 g N-methylformanilide was stirred and allowed to stand at room temperature for 1 h To this claret-colored solution was added 3.0 g of 2,5-dimethoxyphenyl isopropyl sulfide, producing an exothermic reaction and immediate reddening. This was heated for 0.5 h on the steam bath, then quenched in 200 mL of warm H2O producing immediate crystals. Stirring was continued for a few min, and then the solids were removed by filtration, washed with H2O and sucked as dry as possible. When they were ground up under an equal weight of cold MeOH, refiltered and air dried, they gave 2.35 g of 2,5-dimethoxy-4-(isopropylthio)benzaldehyde as pale yellow solids (in some runs this was a pale lime-green color) with a mp of 89â90 Â°C. A wasteful recrystallization from MeOH gave pale yellow crystals with a mp of 90 Â°C sharp.

To a solution of 6.7 g 2,5-dimethoxy-(isopropylthio)benzaldehyde in 40 g of nitromethane there was added 0.10 g of anhydrous ammonium acetate, and the mixture was heated on the steam bath for 2 h. The excess reagent/solvent was removed under vacuum yielding 8.9 g of orange solids. This was recrystallized from 200 mL boiling MeOH providing 6.2 g of 2,5-dimethoxy-Î²-nitro-4-(isopropylthio)styrene as lustrous golden orange platelets.

A solution of LAH (80 mL of a 1 M solution in THF) was cooled, under He, to 0 Â°C with an external ice bath. With good stirring there was added 2.1 mL 100% H2SO4 dropwise, to minimize charring. This was followed by the addition of 5.74 g 2,5-dimethoxy-Î²-nitro-4-(isopropylthio)styrene as a solid, a bit at a time. After 15 min further stirring, the temperature was brought up to a gentle reflux on the steam bath for another 15 min, then allowed to stand at room temperature overnight. After cooling again to 0 Â°C, the excess hydride was destroyed by the addition of 7 mL IPA followed by 6 mL 15% NaOH which was sufficent to give a white granular character. The reaction mixture was filtered and the filter cake washed with THF. The filtrate and washings were pooled, stripped of solvent under vacuum providing 3.9 g of a pale amber oil which was dissolved in 250 mL dilute H2SO4. This was washed with 3Ã75 mL CH2Cl2 which removed the residual yellow color. After making basic with 25% NaOH, the product was extracted with 3Ã75 mL CH2Cl2 and the solvent removed under vacuum to give 2.72 g of a residue which was distilled at 140â145 Â°C at 0.2 mm/Hg to give 2.42 g of a clear white oil. This was dissolved in 25 mL IPA, and neutralized with concentrated HCl. This gave a clear solution which, with good stirring, was diluted with 100 anhydrous Et2O to provide 2.40 g 2,5-dimethoxy-4-isopropylthiophenethylamine hydrochloride (2C-T-4) as white crystals.


## DOSAGE

## DURATION

## QUALITATIVE COMMENTS
(with 9 mg) âAn important characteristic of this experience was the sense of letting go and flowing with it. Just follow where it leads. This seemed to lead to a growing euphoria, a feeling of clearing out of body residues, and the handling of very impressive insights. My thinking continued to grow in clarity, visual perception was crystal clear, and it was a joy to simply look over the scenery, enjoy the beauty, enjoy the companionship, and ponder whatever came to mind. This clarity of body and mind lasted the rest of the evening with a wonderful feeling of peace and centeredness. I still felt a lot of push from the chemical at bed time, causing some tiredness, and allowing very little sleep. I kept working at what had taken place, all night, just to release the experience.â

(with 14 mg) âVery rational, benign, and good humored. The insight and calm common to the 2C-Tâs are present, with less of the push of body-energy which makes 2C-T-2 difficult for some people. There are no particular visuals, but then I tend to screen them out consistently, except in cases of mescaline and LSD and psilocybin, so I canât judge what others would experience in the visual area. The eyes-closed imagery is very good without being compelling. The decline is as gradual and gentle as the onset. I am fully capable of making phone calls and other normal stuff. Music is marvelous, and the body feels comfortable throughout.â

(with 14 mg) âPersistent cold feet, and an uncertain stomach when moving around. Brilliant color trails reminiscent of 2C-B. But a change is occurring and I canât talk myself out of it. There are dark corners. If I were with other people, this would bring out the worst in me, which can be pretty bad.â

(with 19 mg) âI was caught by the TV. Leonard Bernstein conducting West Side Story. I think I know every note. This was a 1985 rehearsal with the goofs and the sweat. And now Peter, Paul and Mary, grown older along with the songs we all sang. Where Have All the Flowers Goneâand an audience of grown-older people singing Puff the Magic Dragon like earnest children and probably crying along with me. It is good to have lived through the 60âs and not to be in them now. Now thereâs a new song about El Salvador and itâs the battle all over again on a different field, but it will always be so, until and unless. Now, in the 80âs, I donât get really angry anymore. I am more warrior than angry protester, and thatâs a much better way to be. In fact, I am quite happy to be where I am. I know a lot more about the game, and what it is, and why it is played, and I have a good idea about my part in it, and I like the part Iâve chosen.â

(with 22 mg) âThe transition took place over three hours, an alert in 30 minutes followed by a slow and gentle climb. I found it difficult, not physically but mentally since I was for a while locked into the illogical and disconnected aspects of human experiences and expressions, particularly laws and pronouncements and unseeing prejudices, most of which I was picking up from reading the Sunday paper book reviews. As time went on, things became less pushy and I came to be at ease with very positive feelings about everything going on. No self-rejecting aspect at all. Sleep was excellent, but the next day things went slowly and I had to nap a bit. Next time, maybe 18 milligrams.â


## EXTENSIONS AND COMMENTARY
I have heard 2C-T-4 referred to as T-4. There is a potent explosive used by terrorists called cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine, known by the code name RDX, or T-4. There is also a T-4 term that refers to thyroxine, an amino acid in the body. The drug 2C-T-4 is neither an explosive nor an amino acid, I am happy to say.

2C-T-4, also known as 4-isopropylthio-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine, is a psychedelic drug of the phenethylamine and 2C families. It is taken orally.
2C-T-4 was first described in the scientific literature by Alexander Shulgin and colleagues in 1991. Shortly after this, Shulgin described 2C-T-17 in greater detail in his 1991 book PiHKAL (Phenethylamines I Have Known and Loved).

## Use and effects

In his book PiHKAL (Phenethylamines I Have Known and Loved), Alexander Shulgin lists 2C-T-4's dose range as 8 to 20 mg orally and its duration as 12 to 18 hours. Its onset is 30 minutes to 2 hours and peak effects occur after 3 hours. The effects of 2C-T-4 have been described and include psychedelic visuals among others. Shulgin devoted a chapter in the first part of PiHKAL to 2C-T-4, describing an intense "plus-four" experience on the Shulgin Rating Scale with a 12 mg dose.

## Interactions

2C drugs are metabolized by the monoamine oxidase (MAO) enzymes MAO-A and MAO-B. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) such as phenelzine, tranylcypromine, moclobemide, and selegiline may potentiate the effects of 2C drugs. This may result in overdose and serious toxicity.

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

2C-T-4 acts as a serotonin 5-HT2 receptor agonist, including of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor. The mechanism that produces 2C-T-4's hallucinogenic effects has not been specifically established, however it is most likely to result from 5-HT2A receptor activation in the brain, a mechanism of action shared by all of the hallucinogenic tryptamines and phenethylamines for which the mechanism of action is known.

## Chemistry

2C-T-4 is the 2-carbon homologue of Aleph-4. The full chemical name is 2-[4-(isopropylthio)-2,5-dimethoxyphenyl]-ethanamine. The drug has structural and pharmacodynamic properties similar to 2C-T-7 and 2C-T-19. A notable analogue of 2C-T-4 is the Ψ-PEA compound Ψ-2C-T-4.

### Synthesis

The chemical synthesis of 2C-T-4 has been described.

### Analogues

Analogues of 2C-T-4 include 2C-T, 2C-T-2, 2C-T-7, and Aleph-4, among others.

## History

2C-T-4 was first described in the scientific literature by Alexander Shulgin and colleagues in a journal article in 1991. Shortly thereafter, it was described in greater detail by Shulgin in his 1991 book PiHKAL (Phenethylamines I Have Known and Loved).

## Society and culture

### Legal status

#### Canada

As of October 31, 2016, 2C-T-4 is a controlled substance (Schedule III) in Canada.

#### China
