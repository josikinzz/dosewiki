I thought it would be nice to have a spot where all of the various 25x-NBOH series can be discussed as a group or individually, questions can be answered, and information can be dispersed.


Relate your usage and discuss!

Thanks for starting the thread Simstim.  I admit ever since some of these stronger phenethylamines came out there has been a lot of conflicting info.  Also I know some are safer than others but it is an alphabet soup of names and I can never keep track.  I know the nbomes were considered dangerous and shallow yet some pretty knowledgeable people said they were worthy and deep.  So I never rule out any psychedelic.  I just think it comes down to proper and safe usage if that is possible.  Maybe a thread like this can flush out some facts and keep the playing field safe.


I'd like to see the safety profile as well as more trip reports.  Maybe a more detailed difference between nbomes and nbohs.


I honestly did not know this class was still being used since there were deaths with nbomes.

I’ve got a few tabs of this pulled out into my “to do” jar. Awaiting some more reports from BLers. R*ddit seems okay with the stuff but they a level above 4chan there, so waiting for harm reduction focused peeps testimonies lol. 

I’d be brave and guinea but I’m fat and old

tried multiple times 25c and a few 25d. Tricky to dose but to my taste, qualitatively fun and prosocial effects


Deffo dangerous stuff for rookies but in hands of experimented psychonauts worthwhile material. I would have tried the whole series of compounds if I could


I thught they dissapeared long time ago. Maybe they are living underground now?

Curious about these, they're supposed to be safer than the nBomes. I remember reading a pretty detailed report by some madlad on Reddit who was vaping nBOHs

I'm really interested in 25E-nBOH it sounds like it's a decent psychedelic but there is not many reports on it at all. I feel like this class has been out a long time and nobody is ordering them much. One of my main Chinese Vendors I use had had 25B-nBOH on the menu for years, I always heard that corresponding nBOME was incredibly visual drug but mentally transparent. I had like 7 of the nBOME's in an old collection but I was scared to take them, from what I understand tho the nBOH's are safer...

I have tried 25i, 25b, and 25e-NBOH. I liked all three.


I think by weight 25e-NBOH is the most potent.


I think it's amazing that even the NBOH of 2C-H is a potent psychedelic.


Proper safety with dosing is critical with these. Shit can get way too intense really fast if you dose too high.


I did read an article about how NBOH drugs are neurotoxic to certain brain derived cell lines. That's not encouraging, but it's always one heck of a trip!

I know dosage recommendations are not the best thing to do around here but if 100 mcs of LSD is a dose what would equivalent be for one of these? I mean some of those blotters from years ago we’re dosed at a milligram yet some said only 300 mcs needed. (at least with the nbomes)


I guess the question is what is a normal just above threshold dose of an nboh and are they all equal or should dosage be considered different for each one?  How does one approach these with caution?


I think a lot of info is missing and I am seeing nboh's sold these days.

They all tend to vary a bit in potency,  but all of them I have seen on blotters were advertised at 1.2mg.


It seemed to me like the 1.2mg 25e-NBOH blotters hit harder than the 1.2mg 25b-NBOH blotters. I'm not saying 1.2mg 25b-NBOH blotters didn't hit though. 


I've never had less than 7mg in a dose of 25i-NBOH and that was REALLY intense and not necessarily safe.

Yeah, they are so ridiculosly potent that it makes sense that they can be even neurotoxic at certain levels


Also they are the only 5ht psychs know to produce some fatalities in constrast with the rest of classics (pikals and tikals) ones

Sorry for all the questions.  But I think the thread was created to flush out some of the unknowns.  Not sure we will know but worth poking around.


There as also the notion they kick tolerance up to regular psychedelics.  Some said permanent but I don't believe we know enough to say that though.

Full agonism of 5-HT2 receptors leading to extremely severe vasoconstriction, seizures, and often -most likely as a result of the vasoconstriction- organ damage.

A friend of mine nearly died from two tabs of NBOMe sold as LSD, he doesn’t seem to have any increased psych tolerance over 2 years later.

Bingo, thanks for answering two questions directly [@arrall](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/537433/)   I think this type of detailed info and poking around is important.  I think a person should come to this thread and know as much as they can about this class of drugs.  There is a lot of folk lore and myths surrounding a lot of them


Still I would like to try 300 mcs of one.  Just to get a feel.  But may have to just read about them.  Reading can be interesting enough though.

The problem with the NBOMes is that they are so unpredictable and the dose-response curve is both very steep and varies incredibly from person to person. A milligram or two can be a fun trip for one person and a trip to outer space for another and a trip to the hospital/afterlife for someone else. And there is really no way to know until you try it. I don’t think that anyone has ever died from 300ug, but I’m not positive on that and I don’t know if you would get much of a trip from that low of a dose.

Hmm, yeah maybe just reading about them is good enough for me. lol  I mean worrying about dying when tripping is bad enough when you know you are not going to die on mushrooms.  But to worry for real as you are sorcered does not sound fun.


I don't do dissociatives.  But I do like reading reports and people's experience.  Reading is good.  Sometimes I feel safe not putting things in my body but reading others experience fills in some details.

I think it's not quite fair to compare the NBOH to NBOMe. NBOH has not caused the same kind of health issues and deaths

This exactly. I wouldn't say that NBOH is safe, but it does not seem to have a high likelihood of causing long-term health issues or death and seems to retain the desirable effects that made people risk death to try NBOMe.

We just don't know if they're safer. I got the impression that NBOMEs were widely used when they were around. Cheap, highly visual, cognitively unthreatening, and easy to pass off as LSD - they had broad appeal. They changed when people started dying. I don't think NBOHs were ever as widely used after their subsequent release.

No, plenty of others have for one reason or another. Bromo-dragonfly, 2C-T-7, 2C-T-21, DOC, and 5-MeO-DMT have all killed people at various times. Erowid.org loosely tracks reports of fatalities.

I wouldn't call NBOH's cognitively unthreatening.


My first experience with 25i-NBOH I could see my cells rupturing and was convinced that I was dying. I was crying and saying goodbye to my family.


My first experience with 25e-NBOH (3 blotters) was so intense that I aborted with 30mg of olanzapine.


Some people flip out when they get this class of drugs instead when they expect LSD.


It's probably not something I would normally give a psychedelic novice.

That's good to know! Do you have any experience with NBOMEs that you can compare the NBOHs with?

That is a scary notion when someone is tripping in DMT or mushrooms and know they are taking a safe substance.  But in the back of the head to know that at least with a similar release of chems some people have died.  Maddening.  Glad you are ok and it was just a deep trip.


Still though, would like to see the visuals.  It is hard to imagine getting such visuals without the mind also tripping just as hard.  I never thought any psychedelic was shallow. I mean I see 2C-I and 2C-B get that thrown at it but I and others have had some deep 2C-B trips..

That´s right!, however dragonflies are no pikals classics, the t7 and t21 death where mostly for binge overdose with other hackathon of susbtances IIRC. I didnt know the DOC and 5-meo fatalities. I honestly thought it was not even possible... I mean, I have done ridiculous amounts of 5 meo in the past... but its a good point to have this right

I believe that the 5-meo-DMT death(s?) Were in conjunction with an MAOI for a pharmahuasca type thing. I could be wrong, the issues with 5-meo-DMT were very rare and a long time ago. The only thing I remember about it is that rhabdomyolysis was a contributing factor in one death.

That's my understanding. I'm not counting any death associated with vomit aspiration or drowning.


2C-T-7 deaths were either through drug combinations or intranasal use. I believe it's thought to be peak plasma levels that are the culprit.


2C-T-21 was unmeasured and oral, very likely a massive overdose.


We can't tell from the forensic info if that was the case with the DOC fatality.


The 2C-E death was unmeasured and intranasal, likely a huge overdose.


The 2C-P death was a heavy dose, but not one I thought all that outlandish iirc.

_

Compared to these (not you, bromo-dragonfly,) the NBMOEs were vastly more hazardous. The difference between an active dose and a life-threatening dose was small. There were cases of people dying from a single tab off of a sheet that the victim had taken several tabs from on prior occasions, possibly due to uneven distribution of the drug in the blotter paper.


I've yet to hear of a single hospitalization or death involving an NBOH, but I think they're only a fraction of the popularity of NBOMEs in their heyday.

[There's officially been a scientific report of hospitalization with severe symptoms following 25B-NBOH ingestion.](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15563650.2022.2053150) It states: "Five patients presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with altered conscious state following exposure to powder sold as 'powdered LSD' at a party. A 24-year-old male who ingested the powder developed mydriasis, tachycardia, hypertension, and severe agitation requiring parenteral sedation. A 22-year-old male who insufflated the powder developed status epilepticus requiring intubation. Both patients developed acute kidney injury and one had rhabdomyolysis."


While luckily none of the patients died, it is notable that the symptoms they experienced are the same ones generally preceding death from NBOMes as well as the handful of other psychedelics that have killed people, especially status epilepticus and rhabdomyolysis. To my knowledge, this is the first official account of the use of NBOHs going nearly as badly as the use of NBOMes has before. I would be careful to be optimistic about the fact that no one died, because if they had those symptoms then they certainly had the potential to, but on the other hand I will point out the fact that these people thought they were taking "powder LSD." Or in other words, they were dosing 25B-NBOH powder directly without even knowing what they were taking, so, it's very possible that these were fairly reckless circumstances for the drug in question. I don't have access to the full article to see if they said anything about dosages used, though.


I just happened upon this the other day and felt it was worth sharing.

Certainly worth sharing, thanks Kaleida.  My guess would be those kids were being really reckless, it mentions that one of them snorted it, I can just imagine "bro I'm gonna snort a line of powdered acid".  But it does show that the toxic effects that made NBOMes so dangerous are possible with NBOHs.

The death from 2C-E was with around 100mgs intranasal supposedly. Some dumb ass brought a bag to a party and dished out lines to a bunch of people and numerous people obviously got sick and seriously distressed. Sadly one of them died and this is one of the cases that led to many of the 2C-x being scheduled back in 2012.


Can you imagine how horrible that must of been for them and painful it would have been to snort so much. When I put 20mgs 2C-E up my nose a few times its some of the worst experiences I've had sniffing drugs.

one question about 25e-nboh. it is also sold as blotters. i read that all n-benzyl peas are not orally active. i now heard from 2 people that swallowed these blotters that it is active. no personal experience with this compound.

I’m thinking of buying a g of 25b-nboh. It’s not going to be around for ever, so do you think it’s worth it? I had one of my best trips on 25c-nbome.

I think it's worth it. I got a gram myself some time ago and it's been great. I don't regret the investment at all.


I think that I liked 25e-NBOH a tiny little bit more. 25i-NBOH was also the shit. I've never done an NBOMe for comparison but it's hard to beat the NBOH series in terms of sheer potency and intensity of effect.


As cheap as 25b-NBOH is right now it's very hard to beat when you compare to effect. Also one gram could easily last a person for years.


If I continue to use 4mg doses that's 250 strong trips.


Someone recently posted that they tripped on 400 and 800 mcg of 25b-NBOH. The blotters I was getting were 1200mcg and 3-5 of those was a good time to me. (I guess I have some tolerance).


I have been regularly snorting 3-10mg. Mostly in the 3-6mg range.


I have done the same with 25i-NBOH (about 7-8 mg intranasal) and 25e-NBOH up to around 6mg sublingual.


Apparently the NBOH's would seem to be less toxic than the NBOMe's. As in I'm not dead yet and I have experienced some intense psychedelic effects.


Highly recommended.


In fact I'm thinking of getting a second gram just because it won't be around forever and I'm using this first one up faster than expected.


Tolerance is a beast with 25b-NBOH though. I have been using it regularly with x pills and took a week off before dosing 2mg of DOC on Saturday and I didn't really trip.


So then I snorted 7mg of 25b-NBOH on Sunday and also did not really trip. That should have been an intense experience but because of tolerance wasn't.


So keep in mind that just because a gram could be reasonably seen as a thousand hits it's also not even possible to trip as often as you might like to because of tolerance. Also it WILL take more than a mg if you ever develop a tolerance like I have.

Yeah, I share your sentiments. It’s not going to be around so might as well grab it while you can. As you metioned above, a gram will last me quite some time so the investment is def worth it. I dunno I feel like I hit a dead end with lysergamides. I take 3 tabs of acid and barely get any visuals, it just messes with my head more than anything. I’m wondering if a phenethylamine will tap into something that its counterpart can’t.  


I miss 2c-x compounds so I’m looking to forward to this one. I’ve heard various ROAs, what do you recommend?

When I take 25b-NBOH without tolerance the visuals are intense. So much so that I let my buddy sniff about 4mg and he told me not to do that to people anymore because it was too intense for him. He said nothing was real anymore and had a pretty difficult experience.


If three hits of acid aren't doing it for you then the 25b-NBOH might not either. Tolerance is a serious problem for me with it. If I could I would probably trip daily but it seems to take at least a couple of weeks for tolerance to reset and I'm not the most patient about waiting that long.


If you're like me then just knowing that you have a stock of such a potent psychedelic will make you feel better about life in general.


About ROAs I have only tried sublingual and intranasal. I prefer intranasal but then I like to trip hard and rocket to the peak. Sublingual is a much more gradual transition. I usually hold my saliva in my mouth for about half an hour. It does numb your tongue. That's how you can easily tell if blotters are something like an NBOH instead of LSD (it will numb your tongue).


I have not tried IM or IV. I probably will try it IV at some point just because I enjoy it with tryptamines and haven't tried it with a psychedelic phenethylamine yet. You come up so fast when you snort it that I'm not sure that IV would be that much of an improvement. I'm pretty sure [@deficiT](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/185147/) said he tried it once.


I know 25i-NBOH is not very soluble in water so that could also be an issue with 25b-NBOH. I found that once when I tried to dissolve about 13mg in a few mL of water and it didn't go. 


I thought it dissolved and rinsed the glass vial that I was working with and sniffed what I thought was likely to just be some residue mixed with water and I ended up tripping harder than I ever have before.


This was also in 2013 when NBOMe's were out and some people had died from it. People died on a lot less than 13mg of 25i-NBOMe so naturally I thought I was going to die. I remember when I closed my eyes I could see my cells rupturing. I was crying and saying goodbye to my family and shit.


So be careful with the dosing and always use a mg scale. I would say to dose it volumetrically if you want to be accurate. I bet it's plenty soluble in alcohol.


I've taken up to 10mg of 25b-NBOH and lived so I think it's fair to say that it's less deadly than the NBOMe series. I've also taken it several times with MDMA and I've heard that people died from NBOMes combined with MDMA. So again the NBOH would appear to be less toxic.

This a great info for people all the time bullshitting about some substances with close active dose to od amount.


I used close to 40mg of 2c-e as my biggest dose. Yeah, orally but still, that’s not even 3x the dose that killed. And I personally know person who snorted 50 - 60mg of 2c-e and had a great experience, so maybe not even 2x more was needed for lethal dose, and he originally intended to do 100+ mg as it’s a “safe drug” just to be stopped by a bit wiser friend!


On the other hand I had a great experience with 500 – 600µ of 25c-nbome and know people who have gone 50x higher. (yeah I know some supposedly died from less) Single blotter of nbome can kill either in combo with something or if it’s covered with powder.


Now BDF, I had great experience with about 1 – 1.5mg max, know many people who took multiple times that and even OD case with it, I wont even say how much but could have ended very bad, luckily just changed that persons life for the better.


Sure snort nbomx or BDF and you’ll kill yourself easy but speaking of killer blotter from outer space while claiming 5-meo-dmt can’t kill...wow RC scene was and is full of way more dangerous stuff than named, only reason why people don’t drop like flies from that stuff is it’s not active in microgram range.


If it’s bitter it’s a spitter not a killer!

I have some really good MDA that I wanna combine with something, but I definitely need to try 25b on its own to get familiar first. It’s not that I have a tolerance. I don’t trip often, however I used to trip all the time when I was younger. I feel like structural changes in my brain happened as I got older and I don’t respond to Psych’s like I normally do.


Also, IV sounds pretty nice, bet that’s one hell of a ride. So is 1-1.5mg intranasally a good launching pad?

the problem with snorting (my favorite ROI) is that you cannot see doses that are measured in micrograms.

nbomes never should ever go in the nose,

Well it’s nbohs that we’re referring to. Yes they may be a little safer as in they are less potent than NBOMEs, but still trying to sniff 1-2mg can be difficult unless one accurately  and volumetrically using a nasal spray bottle. I’m still a little concerned about how to weigh and which roa to use. I definitely need to use a solution. I’m guessing it’s soluble in saline?


I recklessly sniffed up some 25c-nbome when I was younger. Roughly 1-1.5mg and had one of the best trips of my life in terms of sheer recreation and beauty.

I have an intranasal bottled solution  of selank that exerts 600mics per spray and a bottle of Semax that exerts 300mics per spray. I’m not sure how many mls it’s dissolved in so I contacted the company I got it from. Never

Got much from either compound so ill just dump the remaining solution. Also, the stories of hair loss concern me albeit I’m not sure of the veracity of such claims.

Empty the bottle, add X ml of water, push Y times until it doesn’t spray any-more and dissolve appropriate amount of substance as Z. X/Y x Z gives you approximately how much every push gives you of substance Z. Adjusting for volumen change isn’t really needed but better do it if you can, but be sure to dissolve it very well and other percussions, don’t use something that evaporates fast etc.


This is better option than adding to solvent with something already dissolved.

I feel a little sketched out about my Semax spray bottle. I feel like the spraying apparatus got messed up somehow, but the selank on  the other hand delivers a nice even spray, so I’m going with that bottle. Does 25b dissolve easily in saline? It seems polar enough to form a solution with water. Say I dissolved 50mg in  5 ml of saline resulting in 500mics per spray, how much bacteriostatic water should be included?

I’m a hard head when it comes to Psych’s and I have a long history of using them. You think 2 or 2.5 mg is safe enough? I have lyrica and a ton of benzos and clonidine so if I feel it’s taking a bad turn I always have a parachute.

It's good to have benzos on hand if you're having a rough time. Won't make the dosage any safer, of course. That's a separate issue entirely.

I have had 5 of the blotters before (should be 6mg). and have exceeded that since.


2-2.5mg should be ok to test the waters if you've tripped before. Keep in mind NBOH series feels a little different compared to other psychedelics. I mean like lysergamides don't feel like tryptamines so don't expect the NBOH series to feel like either.


I really like it. The whole experience, but I like having my ego shattered and get really religious when I trip.

Oh most definitely I agree, but first thing they’d do medically is to administer benzos to alleviate excessive over stimulation, overheating, seizures, etc. that being said, there’s an obvious point of no return if things get too far out of hand. There’s a high inherent risk with such potent compounds and extra caution must be employed. I’ve had  close calls with phenethylamines when I was younger and more reckless. 


First one occured 12 years when I decided to insufflate 40-50mg of 5-Meo-Dmt at the peak of 30mg 2c-e trip. Landed up in the hospital. I’ve endured my fair share of trauma in my life, but that experience irrepairably scarred me mentally and emotionally. The terror and panic that ensued was ineffable. Stuck in a violent cycle of death and rebirth, my ego being shredded to bits over and over again. Physically my heart almost gave out. The second really bad one was induced by what I believed to be the wrong psychoactive being sent to me. I took a relatively high dose of “2c-c”, and had another traumatic experience . Had 3 seizures during the 10 hour ride through the depths of hell. 


That was some time ago and I ensure to have the proper equipment on hand (testing kits, a reliable mg scale, having Someone aware of my actions etc). 


I had such a a beautiful trip with 25c-nbome and I wanna give 25b-nboh a shot. When properly handled, these substances can provide indispensable experiences.

I didn’t feel like you were coming off like that all. Quite the contrary, I appreciate the care you’re trying to impart. Even the most experienced aren’t insulated from disasterous events. Psychs are unpredictable in nature. I’ve been completely fine after dropping 5 tabs of acid and a complete wreck from 1-2 tabs.

If you are not confident in spray bottle you could also make a solution and use 1ml syringe to measure wanted amount and squirt that up your nose. As it should be very small amount of liquid there wont be any more drip than if you used spray. Same as with drops for nose.

I have found a vendor who I trust who is selling 25e nboh by the 500mg (so minimum a fuckshit’s worth), but there are so few reports on this drug, like a few on Reddit but those folks are insane, and practically nothing here or on erowid.

Ah, simstim. The only reference on bluelight for this series of drugs, as far as I know… I guess these haven’t had the popularity of nbomes due to the ease of purchasing lsd analogs on the same sites that sell them? 


Would you compare these in any way to lsd, shrooms or any other common psychedelic, or are they incomparable? Do you prefer them?

I'm not sure if it's just me, but benzos are literally my personal "spirit object" while tripping (LSD, DMT, and mushrooms). It's an anchor for me.


The very fact of having benzos around makes everything better.


Whenever I take LSD or DMT (or when I used to taking mushrooms), I will place a blister pack of alprazolam in my pant pocket, and during intense phrases of the trip, I hold onto the blister packet as my spirit object. It makes me 10x calm knowing that I'm in control of everything and that I can "abort" the trip if I need to.

I would say that they are most similar to the 2c series. Similar duration, similar kind of feel, but they are so much more potent that in high dose it's really different from the 2c's and DOx.


Of the three NBOH that I have tried they all have features in common that makes them feel like a new family of psychedelics. I have gotten some pretty insane auditory distortions from all three too (especially with higher doses). 


I have really had some good trips on all three and they have always been cheap so that's a plus. I like to trip hard and several mg of NBOH is a really good way to trip hard for me.

Well finally getting some 25bnboh this time. My initial order my vendor had  disappeared and I had trouble finding new source. Unfortunately, it’s not in powdered form, but rather in 600mic blotters. I normally would never buy blotters laid with NBOMEs or nbohs, but my guy has a great reputation and everything else I’ve had from him has been top line.


Kind of bummed I couldn’t get powder as I wanted to experiment with diff ROAs such as vaping and insuflation. Nonetheless sublingual would have been my natural choice. Will report back soon

I have done NBOH's c, b, and i,

I found them exactly the same as NBOM's


I only ever did 1/4 tabs from 10 strips or from 5x5 mini-sheets

Sometimes there were hotspots and I had more intense effects than I wanted from both NBOM & NBOH


This seems obvious to me, that for some people a single tab (from a hot spot on a normal sheet) could easily be over doped with up to twice the usual amount of product, and if a person were extra bold and took 2 tabs that acted like 4, and if they had any cardiovascular succeptibilities then they are playing russian roulette while exploring psychedelia. Even one full tab could be too much for many people.


**I could not possibly declare there was any safety margin in one over the other**, and i destroyed my stash (both NBOM & NBOH) once lysergamides came to the open web market.

They finally arrived. 600 mics blotters. Again, I wished they weren't in blotter form, but that's all I could procure. I agree that tabs aren't the safest medium for NBOMEs and NBOHs, but the vendor is has great reviews and a solid reputation. Anyone seen these lil guys? Also, how does re-dosing work with 25B-NBOH? I wanted to start with 1.2 mg, but seeing how this is my first time, I'll start with one.

Just dropping 1 tab, but I agree with your sentiment. Definitely not ideal, but I trust my source.

I know I'm wicked late to respond to this but I made a thread a little bit back about this fake sheet of "acid" I was sold that ended up being 25C-NBOMe. Lain on a sheet which has a graphic obviously from a page of wizard Mickey mouse imagery. I didn't think to test it until almost 20 tabs had been eaten because it was active when we swallowed it with no sublingual exposure. I posted that thread as a warning not to trust that "if it's bitter it's a spitter" can also be resolved by swallowing, if dealing with an nbome. I was always told to eat tabs so that NBOMes didn't have time to absorb and would just be broken down if I ate them. Not true though, it seems.

Actually if it’s bitter it’s a spitter ain’t that bad for those who can’t test tabs for any reason. DOx and nbome’s I tried and BDF all had bitter taste, quite noticeable. I don’t recall ever taking bitter tab of LSD and I had quite a few but supposedly some did. Sure there’s still a lot of stuff that can fit a tab and won’t have a noticeable taste so if it’s bitter it’s a spitter shouldn’t be considered as a substitute for real reagent or lab test. Also it’s possible to put something on a tongue and wait just a few moments to feel the taste and still absorb enough to feel some high but definitely not to die or lose limbs. I would be more worried about carfent tasteless tabs than putting some psychedelic bitter RC on my tongue.


Think about that many thought how nbome sprays, often dosed high are a good idea as something that’ll find it’s way to public. Tabs were also dosed in a fashion that one was often stronger than quite a few street tabs. Reason for that I believe is that there was no indications that it’ll end up bad for some. I wonder what’s world wide number for people who died from nbome’s. Was there ever anything that popular on the blotter beside acid, ever? I don’t think so.

I agree with you, I should have been more specific in what I meant. I was always taught that the action you can take against NBOMes specifically (though not the now extinct DOX's which have never existed on the street in my life) is to always swallow your blotter, as allegedly no NBOMes were orally active, only sublingually.


G chem and myself have both found 25C-NBOMe to be orally active, however, which is pretty odd. It feels different but is noticeable and a little longer acting than sublingual for myself and a couple others that did this with me.

Scientifically speaking, it would be worthwhile to repeat those experiments with the compound in a capsule. This problem of alleged oral activity was found on the Hyperlab as well, and was "resolved" by encapsulating the compound.

Well not on the street but on festival, parties ect. Yes. Not often tho. Would be sad if it’s really extinct but it’s one of those nice ones that will eventually pop up again I’m sure. Same as 2c-b does but with a problem of initial very bad experience many people had with DOx series. I’ve met quite a few people that ranked their experience with DOx as good as acid just different, also a bit less predictable and acid is better when aiming for a ++++ experience. Most people I’ve met irl prefer doses of 100 – 150µ acid tabs top but find surprisingly nice experience with pretty high doses of DOC, it’s just kind of gentler at medium level, in a sense like mescaline. Those who use acid kind of a upper often find lowish dose of DOI better for that use. Didn’t tried the other ones but I’ve heard great things about many in that series and fly and such variations too are often nice. It also seems that isomers often do work very differently so racemic and each separate isomer can feel really different.

So chopping up tab and putting it to a shot of vodka for a bit should work I guess?


How different was experience? Should this work with other nbomes too? I’m pretty sure no, at least not with most.

I'm not sure if we are talking about the same thing. But such lipophile compounds can be absorbed rather quickly by the mucuous membranes, and strictly speaking, the compound may be rendered inactive by debenzylation in the stomach.


It seems clear that swallowing a tab may not be enough to avoid the action of NBOx - and it will certainly not avoid the action of DOx-type compounds - but it would be interesting to know if these compounds are stable enough against debenzylation in the stomach or not to be active. For this, only a gel cap would help. Dissolving in vodka would only increase the chances of the compound already being dissolved in the mucuous membrames of the mouth.

I don’t see how dissolved vs already dissolved would produce vastly different results. As for that it would be absorbed in the mouth, well if you dilute it in half a dcl or one dcl and wash down with same amount of water. Well I guess I’ll try evaporating if it’s worth it. So could you comment more on a differences in your experiences in using in via various ways and routes.

This was more of a "scientific curiosity" - of whether or not the oral activity was true oral activity, or may be falsified by rapid absorption on mucuous membranes before entering the stomach. I don't remember where exactly, but there was one post where some chemist claimed oral activity for some NBOx, and later had to correct themselves after encapsulating the compound. Dissolving in a huge volume of liquid and chugging it down may keep absorbtion down to a small level. Using a capsule is the better option for controlling the variables in this experiment. Though clearly, eating a tab instead of using it sublingually is also not really harm reduction at all for obvious reasons: 1) it seems clear that NBOMe/NBOH compounds may be absorbed before the stomach or they may be orally active, 2) there are plenty of compounds which fit on a tab which are usually not desired (i.e. not LSD) and which definitely are active orally.


I only have a single experience on a NBOH-type compound (25E-NBOH), sublingually, and it was a disaster enough to have a very healthy respect for this class of compounds now and me not wishing to repeat an experiment in the foreseeable future.


I'm still in the process of figuring stuff out and writing a trip report for that one, although I'm not sure how, when and if I will publish it. Harm reduction efforts demand it though, so in the meantime I can only say: 1.2 mg of the hydrochloride were decidedly too much, and even for a reasonable experienced psychonaut, the stimulation, the sensory overload from all the visuals and the bad stigma of the NBOx compounds make for an excellent combination for substance-induced psychosis and panic loops.

Oh, I got it. I'm not educated in how dilution of very potent chemicals in relatively big amount of liquid before drinking would affect absorption. While difference is probably tiny if chemical has a good oral BA, it could play significant role otherwise. 

Just for the record, I'm not saying swollowing tabs is HR, I'm just interested if maybe nboMe's could work that way but I don't think so.

I plan to revisit nbome's with a bright outlook and different approach compared to when I first tried them. 

Idk what is potency of 25e-nboh but if it's about the same as nbome's, 1.2mg isn't that little at all. That was usually about what dose of nbome tabs were and it wasn't that small dose, more than enough. What caused huge problem imho is that you can't really compare intensity to common psychedelics and also fact that who knows how many people just took a few tabs if they found one weak.

25E-NBOH is a pretty wild thing, I decided to homogenize 10mg of crystal into a known quantity of caffeine powder, then take 1/16 of the total amount per dose. Redosed 5 times last night, tolerance only formed once I'd reached baseline sobriety, reminds me of 25C-NBOMe in this way. 


Experience is strangely cryptic and almost haunting in aesthetic, very interesting.

I've got a mixed batch of 25I-NBOMe/25B-NBOH right now and it's truly something else. I've used them both separately before, I've used 25C-NBOMe, and now 25E-NBOH, and I really don't know which one I prefer, all three are so different. All three noticeably resemble phenethylamines (DOM, 2C-B, mescaline, MDA, etc) in many ways, it's like if meth and acid had a little cousin who understood the importance of brevity. Honestly though, I wish they lasted far longer, I can get 3-4 days out of a monstrous dose of DOM, but a friend of mine who took an estimated 7-8.5mg of 25C-NBOMe still only tripped meaningfully for a few hours before it was just aftereffects, from what I recall. When I was taking 5-6mg doses of it, I never had more than a 6 hour experience, and I'm a specifically slow metabolizer of virtually all drugs. 25B-NBOH felt like if 3 copies of 2C-B all stood on each others' shoulders under a trench coat and tried to convince me that they're acid, but then they drove down the highway at 130+ mph and I asked to get out of the car and just took an Uber home. Damn that shit was speedy, probably the most out of all the NBXX's I've used so far and that's saying something. It's a psychedelic that makes me hesitate to call it one, because I almost feel like it belongs more in the empathogen category, closer to MDA. 25I-NBOMe feels like a crazed, ancient wizard is playing some sort of trick on me. The visuals and headspace are super interesting, unique and useful in my opinion. I'm not sure why I find more therapeutic potential in these drugs than others online, but everyone around me finds them super useful for therapeutic applications in real life which I find interesting.


25C-NBOMe was the first that I came across and to this day it's an all time favorite. Inducing a 3 week tolerance sucks though, and while 25C/I-NBOMe have, B/E-NBOH have not so far, those have only a 2 week tolerance. 25E-NBOH and 25C-NBOMe really resemble one another in my opinion, both are intense, highly stimulating (less than 25B-NBOH though), they possess a great headspace that can go deep if it wants to, and both are impeccable vibe setters in my opinion. I've only lightly explored the 25E-NBOH so far, I need to pick up another box mod tank for it, 5mg/mL juice and a nasal sprayer at 200-250ug per spray are likely what I'm aiming at with it. It felt like 25E-NBOH was an ancient deity inscribing messages I simply can not read into the walls around me, every line bent into a symbol that might mean something to somebody else, but to me it looked like when someone tries to write in Chinese when they're too intoxicated. Redosing NBXX's is quite fun, but it's almost certainly a toxicity amplifier, I would imagine. I've also combined 25C-NBOMe with MDA once (and I think bromazolam?), I specifically want to mix them with LSD, mushrooms, metocin, ethocin, and they've always responded well to any arylcyclohexylamine I threw at them. 25C-NBOMe and 25I-NBOMe really enjoy being in the presence of 3-MeO-PCP and 3-HO-PCP in my experience.


Sorry for the rant on these, I figured I'd leave a record of some of my experience with these compounds on this thread for future readers.

Would you mind during your next experiment with 25E-NBOH, to put some of that mixture in a capsule? I'm curious if/how active it is orally!

I'll definitely have to test it, I've currently got a crazy high tolerance but about a month from now I'll be back at it. I also made a 15mg, 2mL box mod tank out of 25E-NBOH which should be interesting.

No apology necessary on the rant. I appreciate your descriptive posts a lot and these compounds I find to be pretty under discussed! They are somewhat rare now.


I also came to the conclusion that I really like them after having fiddled with a lot of them. I think there was just a lot of misconceptions and anxiety spread about them when they first came out and were going around, due to the reality of misrepresented chemicals being passed around as LSD tabs and the resulting deaths.


I find them great and therapeutic, as well as the most beautifully visual class of psychedelics that exists. Nothing else really comes close for me.


The tolerance ramp up can be quite a bear though!
