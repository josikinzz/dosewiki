## Effects
Tilidine inhibits pain-mediating neuronal systems in the body and thus has a pain-relieving effect. When consumed in higher doses, it has a euphoric and anxiety-relieving effect. Due to its opioid properties, regular use can quickly lead to dependence. Abrupt discontinuation of tilidine leads to withdrawal symptoms.

## Dosage
With slow-release tablets there is a risk of overdose due to delayed release of the active ingredient! The perceived effect is extremely different depending on the person and tolerance.
In combination preparations with naloxone, the desired psychoactive effect of the tilidine is cancelled out from approx. 300 - 400 mg by the naloxone contained.
When consuming for the first time, low doses should be used, as the risk of respiratory arrest is increased.

## Risks

### Short-term Risks
Known adverse reactions are nausea, vomiting, dizziness, drop in blood pressure, drowsiness, tiredness, headache, excessive sweating and nervousness.
In opioid addicts who abuse Valoron® N in high doses as a substitute for morphine or heroin, the drug triggers acute withdrawal symptoms (anxiety, trembling, sweating) due to the naloxone or intensifies already existing withdrawal symptoms.
In higher doses, hallucinations and euphoria may occur, which is why the drug is consumed as a psychoactive intoxicant. The anxiety-relieving, disinhibiting and euphoric properties can lead to aggression, loss of control and increased risk-taking in higher doses. Some German media reported robberies in connection with extremely aggressive, pain-resistant young people under the influence of tilidine.

### Long-term Risks
Regular, abusive use of tilidine can lead to dependence with severe withdrawal symptoms such as seizures, sleep disorders and depression. Withdrawal, as with all opioids, should not be abrupt and should only take place under medical supervision.

## Safer Use
- Opioids are highly effective drugs that should only be used for a limited time and at best under medical supervision.
- Start with a low dose and wait for the effect and tolerance before adding more. Do not exceed the maximum daily dose.
- If you inject opioids, dose even more carefully, as the range between desired effect (rush) and dangerous overdose is even more difficult to assess. Avoid injecting fentanyl; the risk of overdose is particularly high. Always use new (clean and sterile) injection material! Never exchange syringes, filters, water, disinfection swabs to avoid transmission of hepatitis and HIV.
- Do not rely on dosage information from colleagues who regularly use opioids. Due to habituation or dependence, their doses are much higher and can be fatal for new users.
- Take longer breaks (at least several days) between consumption.
- After a period of abstinence, take a much lower dose! The usual dose before the abstinence phase can otherwise quickly have life-threatening consequences.
- The simultaneous consumption of depressant substances such as alcohol, ketamine, GHB/GBL, nitrous oxide, benzodiazepines and/or other opioids is dangerous as there is an increased risk of vomiting and unconsciousness. The risk of suffocation is high!
- Refrain from citrus fruits (especially grapefruit) before or during consumption. The combination can lead to an increase in the effect of the opiate and/or to respiratory depression.

Tilidine, sold under the brand name Valoron among others, is a synthetic opioid analgesic, used mainly in Belgium, Bulgaria, Germany, Albania, Luxembourg, and South Africa for the treatment of moderate to severe pain, both acute and chronic. Its onset of pain relief after oral administration is about 10-15 minutes and peak relief from pain occurs about 25-50 minutes after administration.

## Medical uses

Tilidine is used in the form of hydrochloride or phosphate salt. In Germany, tilidine is available in a fixed combination with naloxone for oral administration (Valoron N and generics); the mixture of naloxone is claimed to lower the abuse liability of the opioid analgesic. This is so that if people take the medication orally (which is the way they are meant to) the opioid blocker, naloxone, has minimal effects on them but if they inject it the naloxone becomes bioavailable and hence antagonizes the effects of the tilidine producing withdrawal effects. In Switzerland the original Valoron brand with only tilidine and no naloxone is also available.
As well as its use as an analgesic, tilidine is also commonly used in Germany for treatment of restless legs syndrome. The reverse ester is also known and is also a prodrug.
Tilidine explicitly without Naloxone is a controlled substance in most countries, listed in the German BtMG, Austrian SMG, and in the USA under the Controlled Substances Act as ACSCN 9750 as a Narcotic under Schedule I, with an annual aggregate manufacturing quota of 10 grams in 2014. It is used as the hydrochloride (free base conversion ratio 0.882) and HCl hemihydrate (0.858).

## Adverse effects

Its most common adverse effects are transient nausea and vomiting, dizziness, drowsiness, fatigue, headache, and nervousness; less commonly, nausea and vomiting (after repeated dosing), hallucinations, confusion, euphoria, tremor, hyperreflexia, clonus, and increased sweating. Uncommonly, somnolence; rarely, diarrhoea and abdominal pain.

## Physicochemistry

It usually comes in its hydrochloride hemihydrate salt form; in this form it is highly soluble in water, ethanol and dichloromethane and appears as a white/almost white crystalline powder. Its storage is restricted by its sensitivity to degradation by light and oxygen, hence necessitating its storage in amber bottles and at temperatures below 30 degrees Celsius, respectively.

## Pharmacology

Considered a low-to-medium-potency opioid, tilidine has the oral potency of about 0.2, that is, a dose of 100mg p.o. is equianalgesic to approximately 20mg morphine sulfate orally. It is administered orally (by mouth), rectally (by a suppository), or by injection (SC, IM, or slowly IV).
Tilidine itself is only a weak opioid, but is rapidly metabolized in the liver and gut to its active metabolite nortilidine and then to bisnortilidine. It is the (1S,2R)-isomer (dextilidine) that is responsible for its analgesic activity. Nortilidine binds to opiate receptors in the central and peripheral nervous systems and suppresses pain perception and transmission.
To purportedly counteract the abuse potential, tilidine is used in combination with the opioid receptor antagonist naloxone. The mixing ratio with naloxone is chosen so that the analgesic effect of tilidine is not impaired. The effectiveness of this has been called into question and users largely report no reduction of peripheral effects.

## Pharmacokinetics

Tilidine is rapidly absorbed after oral administration and is subject to a pronounced first-pass effect.
The conversion of tilidine into the more active metabolite nortilidine occurs with the participation of CYP3A4 and CYP2C19. The inhibition of these enzymes can thus alter the efficacy and tolerability profile of tilidine. The analgesic effect occurs after 10-15 minutes. After oral administration of 100mg tilidine plus 8mg naloxone, the maximum effect is reached in about 25-50 minutes. The duration of action is given as 4-6 hours.
The elimination half-life for nortilidine is 3-5 hours. Tilidine is metabolized to 90% and eliminated renally. The rest appears in the feces.
Depending on the extent of the impairment, the maximum concentration of nortilidine in plasma is lower in insufficient liver function than in healthy individuals and the half-life is prolonged. In case of severe hepatic insufficiency the therapy is questionable. In these cases, it is possible that the formation of active nortilidine may be so low that the analgesic effect is insufficient. In addition, in the combination preparations with naloxone, the inactivation of the same can only be insufficient. The consequent antagonism of nortilidine’s effect can lead to a further loss of activity.

## Synthesis

The condensation between Crotonaldehyde (1) and dimethylamine (2) give dimethylaminobutadiene [139943-10-5] (3). The Diels-Alder reaction with ethyl atropate [22286-82-4] (4) yields a mixture of isomers, of which only the (E)-(trans)-isomers are active.
The separation from the mixture by precipitation of the inactive (Z)-(cis)-isomers as zinc complex. The inactive (Z)-(cis)-isomers may be epimerized to the more thermodynamically favored (E)-(trans)-isomers via reflux in diluted phosphoric acid.
