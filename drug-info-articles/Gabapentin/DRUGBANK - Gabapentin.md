## Overview

### Description

This compound belongs to the class of organic compounds known as gamma amino acids and derivatives. These are amino acids having a (-NH2) group attached to the gamma carbon atom.

### Background

Gabapentin is a structural analogue of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (
GABA
) that was first approved for use in the United States in 1993.
16
It was originally developed as a novel anti-epileptic for the treatment of certain types of seizures
14
,
5
- today it is also widely used to treat neuropathic pain.
8
,
10
Gabapentin has some stark advantages as compared with other anti-epileptics, such as a relatively benign adverse effect profile, wide therapeutic index, and lack of appreciable metabolism making it unlikely to participate in pharmacokinetic drug interactions.
5
,
3
,
16
. It is structurally and functionally related to another GABA derivative,
pregabalin
.

### Indication

In the United States, gabapentin is officially indicated for the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia in adults and for the adjunctive treatment of partial-onset seizures, with or without secondary generalization, in patients 3 years of age and older.
16
In Europe, gabapentin is indicated for adjunctive therapy in the treatment of partial-onset seizures, with or without secondary generalization, in patients 6 years of age and older and as monotherapy in patients 12 years of age and older. It is also used in adults for the treatment of various types of peripheral neuropathic pain, such as painful diabetic neuropathy.
19

### Pharmacodynamics

Gabapentin is an anti-convulsant medication that inhibits the release of excitatory neurotransmitters, allowing for its use against pathologic neurotransmission such as that seen in neuropathic pain and seizure disorders.
16
,
19
It has a wide therapeutic index, with doses in excess of 8000 mg/kg failing to cause a fatal reaction in rats.
21
Gabapentin is ineffective in absence seizures and should be used in caution in patients with mixed seizure disorders involving absence seizures. Gabapentin has been associated with drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), otherwise known as multi-organ hypersensitivity. This reaction can prove fatal and early symptoms such as fever, lymphadenopathy, and rash should be promptly investigated.
16
,
17
,
19

### Mechanism of Action

Voltage-dependent calcium channel subunit alpha-2/delta-1
Inhibitor

### Absorption

Absorption of gabapentin is thought to occur solely via facilitated transport by the LAT1 transporter within the intestines.
5
As this process is saturable, the oral bioavailability of gabapentin is inversely proportional to the administered dose - the oral bioavailability of a 900mg/day regimen is approximately 60%, whereas a 4800mg/day regimen results in only 27% bioavailability.
16
,
18
The T
max
of gabapentin has been estimated to be 2-3 hours.
17
,
5
Food has no appreciable effect on gabapentin absorption.
16
,
18

### Metabolism

Gabapentin is not appreciably metabolized in humans
16
,
17
- in humans, metabolites account for less than 1% of an administered dose, with the remainder being excreted as unchanged parent drug in the urine.
5

### Half-life

The elimination t
1/2
of gabapentin in patients with normal renal function is 5-7 hours.
16
,
17
,
5
In patients with reduced renal function, the elimination t
1/2
may be prolonged - in patients with a creatinine clearance of <30 mL/min, the reported half-life of gabapentin was approximately 52 hours.
16
,
17

### Toxicity

The oral TDLo of gabapentin in humans is 2.86 mg/kg and the LD
50
in rats has been found to be >8000 mg/kg.
21
Symptoms of overdose are consistent with the drug's adverse effect profile and involve CNS depression (e.g. dizziness, drowsiness, slurred speech, lethargy, loss of consciousness) and gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea.
18
,
17
Management of overdose should involve symptomatic and supportive treatment. Gabapentin can be removed by hemodialysis - this may be of benefit in some patients, such as those with impaired renal function.
20
Multi-drug overdoses involving gabapentin, particularly in combination with other CNS depressants such as opioids, can result in coma and death - this possibility should be considered when managing overdosage.
17

### Drug Interactions

This information should not be interpreted without the help of a healthcare provider. If you believe you are experiencing an interaction, contact a healthcare provider immediately. The absence of an interaction does not necessarily mean no interactions exist.

1,2-Benzodiazepine
The risk or severity of CNS depression can be increased when Gabapentin is combined with 1,2-Benzodiazepine.
Acetazolamide
The risk or severity of CNS depression can be increased when Acetazolamide is combined with Gabapentin.
Acetophenazine
The risk or severity of CNS depression can be increased when Gabapentin is combined with Acetophenazine.
Agomelatine
The risk or severity of CNS depression can be increased when Gabapentin is combined with Agomelatine.
Alfentanil

### Mechanism of action

The precise mechanism through which gabapentin exerts its therapeutic effects is unclear.
16
,
17
The primary mode of action appears to be at the auxillary α2δ-1 subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels (though a low affinity for the α2δ-2 subunit has also been reported).
10
,
8
,
14
The major function of these subunits is to facilitate the movement of pore-forming α1 subunits of calcium channels from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cell membrane of pre-synaptic neurons.
10
There is evidence that chronic pain states can cause an increase in the expression of α2δ subunits and that these changes correlate with hyperalgesia.
8
Gabapentin appears to inhibit the action of α2δ-1 subunits, thus decreasing the density of pre-synaptic voltage-gated calcium channels and subsequent release of excitatory neurotransmitters.
10
It is likely that this inhibition is also responsible for the anti-epileptic action of gabapentin.
14
There is some evidence that gabapentin also acts on adenosine receptors
15
,
12
and voltage-gated potassium channels,
13
though the clinical relevance of its action at these sites is unclear.

### Volume of distribution

The apparent volume of distribution of gabapentin after IV administration is 58±6 L.
16
,
17
The drug is found in the CSF in concentrations approximately 9-20% of the corresponding plasma concentrations and is secreted into breast milk in concentrations similar to that seen in plasma.
16
,
17
,
5

### Protein binding

Less than 3% of an orally administered dose of gabapentin is bound to plasma proteins.
16
,
17

### Route of elimination

Gabapentin is eliminated solely in the urine as unchanged drug.
16
,
17
Cimetidine, an inhibitor of renal tubular secretion, reduces clearance by approximately 12%, suggesting that some degree of tubular secretion is involved in the renal elimination of gabapentin.
5

### Clearance

Both the plasma clearance and renal clearance of gabapentin are directly proportional to the patient's creatinine clearance due to its primarily renal elimination.

### General Function

The heterodimer with SLC3A2 functions as a sodium-independent, high-affinity transporter that mediates uptake of large neutral amino acids such as phenylalanine, tyrosine, leucine, histidine, methionine, tryptophan, valine, isoleucine and alanine (PubMed:10049700, PubMed:10574970, PubMed:11557028, PubMed:11564694, PubMed:12117417, PubMed:12225859, PubMed:15769744, PubMed:18262359, PubMed:25998567, PubMed:30867591, PubMed:9751058). The heterodimer with SLC3A2 mediates the uptake of L-DOPA (By similarity). Functions as an amino acid exchanger (PubMed:11557028, PubMed:12117417, PubMed:12225859, PubMed:30867591). May play a role in the transport of L-DOPA across the blood-brain barrier (By similarity). May act as the major transporter of tyrosine in fibroblasts (Probable). May mediate blood-to-retina L-leucine transport across the inner blood-retinal barrier (By similarity). Can mediate the transport of thyroid hormones diiodothyronine (T2), triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) across the cell membrane (PubMed:11564694). When associated with LAPTM4B, the heterodimer formed by SLC3A2 and SLC7A5 is recruited to lysosomes to promote leucine uptake into these organelles, and thereby mediates mTORC1 activation (PubMed:25998567). Involved in the uptake of toxic methylmercury (MeHg) when administered as the L-cysteine or D,L-homocysteine complexes (PubMed:12117417). Involved in the cellular activity of small molecular weight nitrosothiols, via the stereoselective transport of L-nitrosocysteine (L-CNSO) across the membrane (PubMed:15769744)
