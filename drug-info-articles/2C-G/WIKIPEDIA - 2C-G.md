# 2C-G
*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2C-G*

2C-G, or 2C-G-0, also known as 3,4-dimethyl-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine or as 3-methyl-2C-D, is a psychedelic phenethylamine of the 2C family. First synthesized by Alexander Shulgin, it has structural and pharmacodynamic properties similar to 2C-D and Ganesha (G). The drug has a number of known homologues, which are known as the 2C-G series of compounds.

## Use and effects

In Alexander Shulgin's book PiHKAL (Phenethylamines I Have Known and Loved), the dose range is listed as 20 to 35 mg orally. Effects are similar to the related Ganesha, and are extremely long lasting; the duration is 18 to 30 hours. Visual effects are muted or absent, and it is described as an "insight-enhancer". Unlike other members of the 2C series, 2C-G is nearly as potent as its amphetamine form.

## Interactions

## Chemistry

### Synthesis

The chemical synthesis of 2C-G has been described.

### Homologues

Several homologues of 2C-G (2C-G-0) were also synthesized and/or tested by Alexander Shulgin. These include 2C-G-3, 2C-G-5, and 2C-G-N. Some, such as 2C-G-1, 2C-G-2, 2C-G-4, and 2C-G-6, are possible to synthesize in principle but impossible or extraordinarily difficult to do so in practice.

## History

2C-G was first described in the literature by Alexander Shulgin in his 1991 book PiHKAL (Phenethylamines I Have Known and Loved).

## Society and culture

### Legal status

#### Canada

As of October 31, 2016; 2C-G is a controlled substance (Schedule III) in Canada.

#### United Kingdom

2C-G and all other compounds featuring in PiHKAL are Class A drugs in the United Kingdom.

#### United States

In the United States 2C-G is considered a Schedule I controlled substance as a positional isomer of 2C-E and DOM.
