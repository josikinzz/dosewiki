Are you not talking about 4 MMC - Mephedrone? 


There are so many new research chemicals out at the moment its hard to keep up - I could suggest you check some of the Research chemical chat threads around the place. 


I will move this over to Other Drugs where somebody may know the answer for you.

If it follows the normal pattern of N-ethyl compounds it is likely a somewhat less potent version of mephedrone.

**Maybe like this...**


Hi guys,


    Just saw this new compound being offered by a reputable vendor.

    I've drawn a pic of what I figured would be it's structure.


    Is it correct?


    If this follows the same trend seen with ethylone - methylone, we'd find a watered down version of mephedrone. But anyway things could be much different in this case, so don't take my inexpert word for it.

Apologies. Either I wasn't awake enough when I made the above post, or the OP modified the pic. I completely missed the 2nd carbon.


Either way, there is nothing remotely interesting about it ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png).

Seems interesting enough to me, especially if it feels cleaner and less compulsive than mephedrone.

I suspect that this would be illegal in the UK if it is so close to mephedrone. It is not metioned specifically in the [ACMD report](http://www.synchronium.net/2010/04/07/acmd-mephedrone-report-2/) that lead to the ban but it also says that they wanted to be pretty braod about banning all related cathinones.  Perhaps someone with better understanding of chemistry than me would be able to tell whether the it would be illegal in the UK.

It certainly not specifically illegal, but it's a possible analog. Analog of an analog actually.

Got palmed off with this after ordering mephedrone by a vendor.

Suffice to say, no rushes, a bit like weak methylone.

Didnt enjoy it that much was expecting meph.

I seen some vendor selling this stuff called Mad Cat, some random green powder.

Said to be a meph replacement. They wont actually say whats in it though

You think it could be this?

While we are on the subject of new RC's....


Anyone seen 'Benzofury' for sale? Well my son knows the vendor very well, and he sent him a free sample. I had a quick look/smell of it & can confirm that its mainly mephedrone (unmistakeable smell) mixed in with something else that had a strange unpleasant smell. The guy is an idiot btw...


![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)The only sampling that was done in this house was by the toilet lol

Just posted about this in one of the new RC threads, although I avoided the name as it's only on one site so that's enough for sourcing maybe?


Bought half a g, in the spirit of scientific curiosity. Apart from the odd pale green colour everything about it was like the more stinky mephedrone synth. Smell, taste, texture, feel on the sinus, effect, fiending, stinky piss through constricted kidneys, vasoconstriction and an unhealthy obsession with internet filth. If I was going to get more I would want clear info about the contents. 


Can't help but wonder if an RC seller, with a lot of old stock and no adequate connections to bad people, has found a way to colur it and pass it off?

A reputable vendor is sending this stuff (4-Methyl-N-ethylcathinone) out as a mephedrone replacement, given the passage of new drug laws in the vendor's home country. It's a good deal weaker than mephedrone and probably not less neurotoxic.


75mg intranasal bioassay earlier today produced a short period (roughly 40 minutes) of mild euphoria with only a slight "rush." I felt the urge to speak freely, and at length about a great deal of nothing important. I felt mildly empathetic and stimulated for about one hour. Side effects included some trisma, elevated heartbeat, blurred vision, and sweaty palms -- all of these side effects had tapered off within an hour except for the elevated heartbeat. There was a strong desire to redose. 


I will report back when I have tried a larger amount. It certainly seems a lot weaker than mephedrone OR methylone at this point.

Hey blauwelichten, I have a few questions for you. If you don´t mind disclosing, what was the dosage level, total amount consumed, setting, and route of administration? I have, so far, found an oral dose of 220mg to be quite a bit more cocaine-like than 120mg intranasal (which was, as you say, like a weak entactogen).


I´m preparing to go on a few more trial runs and then submit a full in-depth report.

I don't trust UK vendors anymore. They gone crazy after the ban of cathinones and try to sell left over mephedrone, methylone, butylone, MDPV and in combinations with other rcs under silly names (like 4-MEC, 5-IAI, benzo fury, ...). From the experience report it looks like meph.


Can you obtain lab analysis on your substance?

A little Google suggests 4-MEC is what's in NRG-2 - and this is the reason for there not being much information about it. From what I hear it's not that great so I won't be investing any money in it, particularly given that it is one of the "NRG" chemicals.

I won't even bother to type up the trials and repost them. 4-MEC is absolutely garbage. My partner and I and a couple of select friends have now experimented with doses ranging from 10mg insufflated all the way up to 500mg oral. The final verdict is that it does just about nothing whether you do 50mg or 500mg. Unbelievably, the effect isn't increased by upping the dosage -- AT ALL... we probably just ate 250mg of acetone and a bunch of precursor bullshit for all I know. It has roughly the same level of euphoria as two cups of Starbucks coffee and a hug from your mother. The only thing to write home about is that for a few minutes as you're coming up it feels a bit like a weak cocaine rush before it plateaus into a tease where you almost feel empathetic, talk a little more than normal, and pretend that you're still "coming up." 10 minutes later you will wonder why you just ingested some research chemical that is quite possibly neurotoxic when you could have just plugged a stacker 2 pill up your ass and chugged four red bulls for the same effect. 


Don't look at me, I have no self-respect.


Well, it is doing something to me. I was unable to eat for two and a half days.


A stimulant that barely stimulates but destroys appetite? I really would like to find out if what I took was 4-MEC at all.

We most defiantly do have analog laws. Most of the phenethylamine, tryptamine cocaine and opiate family are covered by this law. I have seen 4-MEC for sale too. I'm pretty sure it's covered.

The phenethylamines in pihkal and many tryptamines are banned, but by specific phrases, i.e. "any tryptamine substituted w/ an alkyl group at the nitrogen atom" or whatever, not by a sweeping, vague condition of "substantial similarity". It's not an analogue law, any compound is determinately legal or illegal, there's no grey area.

No, an analogue law is one that outlaws drugs in a vague way on the basis that they are similar to banned drugs. In UK law, it's legal or illegal in its own right, if you catch my drift. For example, 2C-E is explicitly banned here. Not because it's an analogue of something, but because it's illegal. In the USA, 2C-E isn't scheduled, but it would likely be considered an analogue of mescaline or of 2C-B/2C-T-7, and thus be illegal itself.

4-MEC is shorthand for 4-methylethylcathinone, 5-IAI is another actual chemical name, being short for 5-Iodo-2-aminoindane.  Benzo Fury is most likely named that because of the "benzofuran" part of the chemical name of 6-APB/6-APDB.  I agree, however, that they shouldn't sell things like Benzo Fury, NRG-1/2/etc., and other "named" compounds like that, because that gives them free reign to just mix a couple different RC's if they want, since it's their own creation or whatever.

Like a large number of RC users I have been looking for a drone replacement or since its still not scheduled in the US a decent supplier. But this seems increasingly harder and harder.  Now that mephedrone is so sought after companies are creating new RC's to keep up their profits after mephedrone phase. But almost every new RC I've heard about in the past six months has been shitty. Ive officially given up chasing the drone high and it makes all RC's look dangerous and not worth the time. Just give it time, pretty soon drone will be on the black market just like methcathinone itself. So just think about why your ordering RC's before you purchase them. Hopefully, none of the RC's released in the absence of drone don't have serious health effects.

I think you're talking about methcath, not this. I have a dear friend who was abusing mcat (not mmcat, not mephedrone, not 4-MEC) for a year or so. Terrible for her. Your description fits that drug better (imo?)


Will get some of this soon, and carefully try it out.


Hoo, got some in the mail today. Taking a 5mg dose orally now to *relatively* on the safe side. You never know. 


It looks the methylone I usually get, crushed crystalline-ish powder. Smells awful, much like 4-MMC.

Very glad I'm not snorting this.

Its 100% illegal in the UK. It is a cathinone and the cathinone blanket ban covers this one too.

Best 4mmc replacement i have found is B2. It probably contains something illegal but it certainly does not smell like a cathinone and its pretty damn good. 250mg gelcapped and 5 hours later was still well out of it and no desire to reach for my stash of 4mmc.

Turns out what I got was 4-EMC after all. 

And it was not worth it. More compulsive than Mephedrone, less euphoric, and more stimulating. Vasoconstriction was (for me, atleast) somewhat more pronounced. My hands turned blue after a full night of snorting small bumps (but totalling no more than 500mg), and after that I stayed away.


If you thought mephedrone was terrible, don't go here.

4-mec

4-methylethylcathinone

Mephedrone Substitute

Legal Mephedrone


Seen it being sold on a UK vendor selling "Mephedrone" and "Legal Mephedrone"


Nothing on Erowid, 

Only thing that pops up on google is this post, and vendors.

Interesting

So it's more like a non-recreational/functional version of 4-MMC?


How would it compare to 4-FMC potency-wise?


I guess this is the closest chem to 4-MMC that hasn't been banned

this shit is next level guys, straight up. i've been getting some unfortunately from a physical source for quite more money than i found i can get it. it is waaay better than molly, mephedrone, and other MDxxs, in that you do not experience a real come down with it the day after, you'll feel refreshed actually, though that does not mean you wont experience a crash with an urge to redose. i have been eating and sniffing this stuff for a bit now, and it seems that it really isn't that horrible for you through trials, and uh, lack of error honestly. yes, it doesn't last THAT long, but come on, it shouldn't, its great. it honestly feels like MDMA, except without a comedown, that is the downfall in this drug, i have never even cared for ecstasy or mdxx's, until i found this shit because honestly, its just too good to be true. i have done extensive research in the past couple of months, with a protege too, we ran through about near a half ounce of it in a week or so. but we stopped. 


basically, in essence, its too good to be true. get it while its still available for such cheap prices and after trying this i dont even care to go back to MDMA. 


its not physically addicting, and neither mentally, unless you have an addictive personality, its a bit like bad coke with wanting to redose, but you can cut yourself off eventually and the next days you dont fiend for it so there really isnt a negative.


bottom line? get this shit while you can, i dont care who you are, what you are, where you are.


it was sold to me under the moniker of shard molly, so just so you know... and its dirt cheap.

ooooh, its like super party mode, mephedrone is like too intense, this shit is like perfect, talkative, empathic, relaxed, mellowed, speedy, all at once but not overwhelmingly. way better than mephedrone imo, without a crash whatsover. my friends and i have done up to grams of this stuff without comedown, however on about roughly .25 of 4-MMC i experienced a heavy comedown and tweaking mode, and with a bad crash the next day.


this is faaar superior to meph.

hey guys been a while![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png), i recieved some 4-mec and tonight thought i would try it, weighed out 105 mg at my brothers,took that and left rest there in case of fiending, i have work first thing, slit into 3 lines and snorted them 10 mins apart, burns a litttle but no drip as such, had my 3rd and last line just now, nice little buzz, music appreciation is nicely enhanced and i got a nice headspace, few scalp tingles and a nice buzz going on, not like meph as it not got that "here we go"feeling,not that fiendish , no urge to run up to my brothers and recieve the rest of the 4-mec. atm my conclusion at this dose railed is not bad at 105mg.


an hour or so after my last line, i just feel a bit bored, thankfully got no excess stim and after a spliff will probably be able to sleep, no euphoria or empathy at the dose i took , maybe one day i will take a bigger dose orally sometime, but in no rush to do so

at least combined with bk-MDMA, 4-MEC is really euphoric. I almost couldn't believe it, actually


i'll have to see how it is by itself


I've concluded that the cathinones are only truly enjoyable when plugged (or shot, i'd guess. not my thing)


Have yet to plug 3-FMC, but 4-MEC and methylone are far superior plugged than taken orally. Even 4-MEC on its own produces an incredible rush at 100mg plugged.. a bit strong for me, almost feel sick/dizzy.. (haven't had 4-MMC, maybe similar)


use caution with this stuff. if you plug it, start fairly low, 40~50mg


tolerance builds fast and side effects increase rapidly from repeated/daily use


not one to use more than 2 nights in a row, IMHO.. and best not to redose more than 2-3 times in 24hrs. not good to redose more often than once every 2 hours imo

Since I couldn't find any information about 4mec being vaporized I tried it. 


I weighted 50mg and added the same volume of Sodium bicarbonate and water. It dried out in 2-3 minutes.


I took the first hit on tin foil and I instantly had to puke. It tastes really bad too.


Also, I must say that the comedown (when snorted) was not even comparable to a 4mmc comedown. I couldn't sleep for 10 hours after snorting 150mg. And it took me two days to regain my appetite.


EDIT: I received information from the supplier that this 4mec batch as been contaminated with another compound. Please be careful if your powder is slightly tan. I will keep you informed once the lab analysis is done by the company.

On this board we try to encourage the opposite view, that if there's no info about something it's safer not to do it.

4-MEC will make you nauseous at higher doses.. (I'd say above 100mg in a single dose)

After reading everything I could find on 4-mec, I'm about 90% sure my meph has been cut heavily with it for about 2 months now.  


The first few times I did mephedrone were AWESOME.  Slowly, many of the positive effects and unique side effects (tongue chewing, shortness of breath) started to disappear despite an increasing habit.  Keep in mind I'd only used one vendor to this point.  The meph side effects were replaced by a less intense high and 2-3 days of godawful comedown symptoms afterward.  I was too fatigued to move, would eat 5 boxes of Hot Pockets in a day (really) and cried at the drop of a hat.  Definitely NOT what I felt with meph in the beginning, but I chalked it up to tolerance/serotonin depletion.  


Fastforward to last week when I bought from a different seller--the difference was like night and day!  All the old effects came rushing back, making it clear that I'd been scammed in a major way.  Other customers said they suspected it was being cut as well, though they didn't mention 4-mec.  


Everything I've seen about this new "legal mephedrone" describes my symptoms exactly:


*Milder, less euphoric high than mephedrone

*Extremely dysphoric after effects

*Binge eating on the comedown

*Severe fatigue afterward (2-3 days of sleep)


I assumed the "meph" was good because it was in the form of clear shards that smelled like cat pee...WRONG.  Meph users need to be aware of this, as it will likely become more common as the drug is banned in more places.

after 7 days of continuous use, i have to say that tolerance builds incredibly fast on 4-MEC and it starts to feel more like an SSRI 


wtf


is that how 4-MMC works as well? very strange

not a fan of this one. ~170mg orally produced a VERY weak meph-like effect. some dysphoria present, physical effects seem more..evident, ie. vasoconstriction, excessive sweating, increased heart rate. Was crashing pretty nicely after around 2 hours. 


Idk, this one just feels more damaging to me than 4-mmc or 4-fmc. Could be because there aren't many positive aspects to speak of, so the negatives come out..

A circle of friends had been doing 4-MMC on the regular for quite some time.  It was readily available and consistently available to us.  


There was a several week break in the availability of 4-MMC due to the person with the contact information of the supplier having a mild mental breakdown and going on a two week meth bender...  ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)


When the supplier was contacted again, the quality of the 4-MMC was atrocious.  200mg insufflated had no real rush, made us feel awake and alert, but no euphoria, no mood elevation, and none of that 'droned out' disorientation common from high doses.  (we think what was given to us in this instance was mdpv diluted heavily in another, inert powder as we discovered texture differences in the batch).


The same supplier contacted us regarding 4-MEC.  It was acquired and tested out and found to be, at the very least, more tangibly effective and pleasant on the sinuses.  It has a slight instant burn, more of a shock, that quickly disappears.  Although the powder appears somewhat fluffy or sticky, it dissolves instantly and doesn't clog up like you would expect it to from appearance.  There is not a ton of drip, obviously dependent on the amount done and it seems to allow the sinus' to rehydrate themselves quickly and effectively.  Compared to most 4-MMC, especially the most recent batches, this is like candy...


Several of us did a rigorous experimentation over the course of 24 hours using 100mg bumps.  It seemed to have a softer feel than 4-MMC.  Where 4-MMC kinda felt like a can of Steel Reserve, this was more like a HoneyWeiss.  It also, from the very beginning felt better.  I mean that in the purely psychological sense.  Without knowing hardly anything about it or what to expect, it just created a better, safer(mentally, no idea about toxicity), less sketchy mindset and overall mood.  The only people who seemed to not care for it were those people who had been at the drone game longest (one in excess of 12 months of daily use).  They found it to be weak and uninteresting and just 'not the same' as 4-MMC.  These people switched back to the other batch of horrid drone and really didn't ever want to do the 4-MEC.  I have a theory as to why, which I will explain later.


What solidified my opinion on 4-MEC being an altogether better chem than 4-MMC was when I tried it orally.  I had hesitated on this because it did seem 'softer' than 4-MMC and I assumed that it would also have a softer feel when ingested.


WRONG. 


Well, not so much wrong as surprised.  I ate 300mg dissolved in Diet Coke (when eating drone, I would typically do 200-300 orally depending on quality, and then bump 100 to carry through until it hits) and was going to bump to get going but in getting bumps lined up for others I became distracted.  Before I knew it I was out of my mind with euphoria.  MY eyes were everywhere, I had a big ass grin on my face and I couldn't keep focused on one thing very long.  I felt like I had eaten a couple of very strong hits of x.  I was amazed.  Even more so because I had been putting the stuff up my nose in 100mg shots every hour or so for a day and a half.  I couldn't believe that it caused such a euphoria and altogether rolling vibe.  I never got around to doing the starter line I had intended.  I kept thinking about it (drone habit, is it time for another line yet?) but kept realizing I was still just as good and didn't need to do any more.  That lasted for 3.5-4 hours.  


As a note, in case some of you think that perhaps I had some MDMA and not MEC or some mixture, I can guarantee you that this is not the case.  The amount we acquired would have been financially impossible if it were even a slight mix.  The taste color and texture were not only significantly different than mdma, but consistent throughout.  If there were MDMA, you would be able to see it amongst the fluffy structure of this stuff. 


When I finally noticed a dissipation of the effects, I let it go a little and was surprised that it tapered nicely.  It does not have the drop off of high doses of MMC.  I decided to do a bump and with it I found myself right back into the euphoria and tactile 'rolled out' place I had been.  I was able to maintain this effectively for a very long time.  The comedown was easy, no tweaky, fiending, sketched out mode as I often found with MMC.  There was energy but not speediness and it was relatively easily slept on.  I didn't notice significant side effects such as vasoconstriction and the hot flashes that go along with MMC.  It also didn't come with the delirious 'droned out' mental state that goes along with higher doses.  It felt happy, enjoyable, and good.  It didn't leave me feeling sketchy and fiendy, a sensation that has accompanied MMC from the very beginning.


My experience was not the only one.  I recommended another person in our party try it orally.  Her reaction was exactly the same, and under the same dose and length of use leading up to it.  All aspects of my experience were shared by her up to and including the conclusion that it just feels better in that psychological sense.  


If I had to take a guess at it based on the sensations and emotions this made me feel and left me with afterwards, I would say 4-MEC is probably like a reverse 4-MMC.  They both act on nor-epinephrine, but MMC triggers dopamine in high amounts and little serotonin, MEC gives you little dopamine and high amounts of serotonin.  This would account for a number of things that I noticed to be different in the experience.  The obvious would be the euphoria of MEC compared to MMC.  The second, and arguably most relevant to this thread would be the disinterest in MEC by several HEAVY and long term MMC users.  I would guess MEC is boring to them, or 'just not the same' because they are not being rewarded by a dopamine rush.  I can't fathom why anyone would have reverted back to the crappy drone we had gotten after trying this, until I think about it from a chemical dependence/tolerance standpoint.


All in all, MEC seems pretty fantastic... if you're not trying to replace MMC or a coke habit...  It has a definitively more 'lovey' MDMA type feel, to the point that if given MEC as MDMA in an oral dose, I would likely not be able to notice the difference.  And that is something that I have been wanting to say for a long time, lol.  Life goal #369 completed.


Put it this way, I haven't really ever met a coke head who disliked MMC and the re-dose nature of it.  Most of the people who prefer MDMA dislike MMC until given an opportunity to eat it leading to that 'rolling' feeling, but are still left fiending and disappointed in the duration.  MEC taken orally is extremely powerful to those people who prefer a serotonin high over a dopamine rush.  


The only thing left to cover is the after effects, which seem to be mild.  Body exhaustion that is likely somewhat overstated because of the type of sleep schedule present over the two weeks prior (a few days on, one off...).  There seems to be no hangover depression or afterglow.  It doesn't 'feel' like it was significantly damaging as MDMA and MMC do sometimes.  And the psychological thought process is one of looking back fondly on the experience and wanting to try it again.  MMC never made me look back at the experience fondly, it was fun but it always left me feeling a little sketchy and dirty.  It also seemed to draw the sketchy people out of the woodwork.  I don't get that feeling with MEC and I don't fear seeing the sketchy people coming around because of it.  That is possibly the best part of it in comparison to MMC for me personally.  I don't feel like I am doing something dirty or grimy.  I don't feel like a fiend.


Sorry for the novel.  Just seems to me that people are looking to this or being directed to it as a MMC substitute.  In my opinion, if you are looking for that, you won't like it.  If you are someone who is a fan of MMC but prefer the MDMA-esque qualities of it over the coke qualities of it, you will find more enjoyment in eating MEC.


To the three more recent posts regarding this, I would say that the supply may be weak or simply not MEC.  I have not seen anyone have a strong but also negative reaction.

Great post fella.

Your a fucking superstar!

Ive been hanging out for some decent info, for confirmation of my limited experience and opinion with regards to this chemical, but with real useable well structured observational data.

I'm glad to see that there are at least some true-bluelighters around.

give yourself 150 entirely unusable, but very well deserved points!

@chylldup A very informative post, thanks. From your description 4-mec sounds like a combination of 4-mmc and M1, is that a reasonable assumption?

I don't know how I echo the serotonin vs dopamine parts of chylldups report, I believe those effects may be described poorly by both him and me. This feels more amphetamine like at this dose than methylone or mephedrone but still has a similar to mephedrone feel. I would say this is a amphetamine vs methamphetamine , hydrocodone vs oxycodone type business in terms of side effects. 


So far feels much cleaner and less potent but in a safer, better way. I mean the comparisons to correspond to the fact that I feel like amphetamine is regarded as weaker but safer and more controllable than meth and hydrocodone is weaker but safer than oxy. 


Though both are related, the lesser potency of both is safer and value wise, does relatively similar things. I hope I worded that well enough. Hydrocodone is more functional than oxy same as amp vs meth and same as 4-mec vs meph. 


Strikingly similar comparisons to the aboves I would say in terms of positives and negatives ramification wise.


 If this was available in stead of mephedrone, I feel like the scene wouldn't be in the situation it is now in.

To sum it up, very similar to mephedrone without the intense rush/rolling that is a little too much at times. Much more manageable and cleaner feeling, side effects do prove so far to be less at a 60 mg dose. Less grinding, less sweating, less coldness of extremities, less dehydration, less stupidity, I would guess side effects increase with dosage. 


I really feel that these substances were not dosed with intelligence. A little does seem to go a long way with these guys and this is quite nice at this level. Time to shut up about it and get shit done, wanted to try to set the record straighter for this.

**Recent 4-MEC extravaganza**


I am new to the rc scene so I can't speak to mephe and MDPV unless it was in a salt or party pill I tried that don't list any ingredients, but I liked those and quickly started googling...

I found a wholesale supplier in china and so far, his product has been of good quality at the right price. I have purchased 10 g of 4-MEC and found it to be very clean, good rush (I IV just about everything, being an old speed freak..), and usually a 25 mg shot would do the trick...and it was an excellent aphrodisiac also..

Negative :

Tolerance built quickly or higher doses aren't excetionally toxic because over the course of the weekend the doses got a little bigger and more frequent. My wife and I killed off 10g between Friday and Sunday of a  weekend and then i had a geek on like coke has never done to me. I was positive I had put some to the side, hidden, for a rainy 3 AM, and we turned the house upside down searching for this imaginary treasue. So, yes, it is very more-ish but for the money, worth it. Having learned about that aspect of it, I think some benzo's some time before the last dose is done would help tame that feinding. 

The buzz definitely had a nice rush, a nice ex-y roll with ex-vision, some pattern hallucinations (which don't help making a clean shot after 18 hours or so...), obvious amp-like stimulation that precluded sleep and no appetite...

I obtained 10g of methylon from the same supplier and ignored most forum posts about eating it and whatnot and was deservedly unimpressed from an iV aspect...some rush, quick up, but high doses required (25-40 mg per dose), and frequent. While the experience was okay, it has no comparison to Ex or the MDMA 

of old...I have some more ethyl coming and definitely will go oral to give it a fair shake.

But I really liked the 4-MEC as an iV and having gained some experience of it's ways, I feel my next partaking will be a little more pleasant and enjoyable.


I will just have to accept that these MDMA analogues are just not meant to be iV'd...a couple of things  about the methyl was upon cwe there was a god-awful amount of residue in my mixing bowl; the powder seemed to have the appropriate tannish, off-white appearance, but I haven't read any other methyl-IV post that mentioned this, and the liquid drew up a cloudy green...again, nothing wrong with its effect but was disconcerted to see something mentioned no where else.

So, 4-MEC has a definite fiend aspect via iV, methyl does not. We also killed 10 g of methyl in a weekend but i believe this was due to the iV administration, and there was no fiend to speak of but definitely something to be desired effect-wise.

I sampled some 4-mec recently from a UK source. It was a white grainy powder with a distinctive spunky smell. I weighed out 100mg and insufflated it. There was no significant burn or drip. Within 10 minutes my heart rate had increased and I felt a warm body rush; after 20 minutes mood was elevated and I felt increased alertness. At 30 minutes I felt that I had reached the plateau which was similar to a lowish dose (say 50mg) of 4-mmc so I decided to push it with another 100mg line. This increased the rushes and added the 'messy' edge that is characteristic of 4-mmc, I started to feel some nystagmus and began grinning as a warm energised glow spread over me and euphoria set in. I stayed at this level for the next couple of hours without feeling a need to redose although I did feel like a drink of something alcoholic. I poured a glass of absinthe which seemed to bring out more of the euphoria so I celebrated with another line (estimated at 100mg). By now I was really flying, some jaw clenching and increased depth of breathing but HR had peaked and settled at around 100bpm. I had a stupid grin on my face and was overcome by waves of euphoria. My partner came home and wanted to joint in the fun so we opened a bottle of wine and I racked up another couple of lines. This was when it became evident that it increased empathy and was an entactogen. We spent the evening alternately dancing and sitting talking as our mood shifted between touchy-feely and high energy with music appreciation - talking is great but when you gotta dance you gotta dance. We called it a day around 3.00am and did manage a few hours sleep.


I found 4-mec to be very similar to 4-mmc but with double the dose needed to obtain the same effects. It is definitely entactogenic and mood enhancing and has the right amount of euphoria to back the stimulation. I personally prefer it to MPA as that just provides stimulation and seems to have a very long half-life. I did not suffer any negative effects in the days after this experience and will repeat it, probably by trying it orally with some MDAI.

Just a quick and very important update.  We determined that the 4-mec referenced in my previous post was actually cut with MDPV which is what gave it that pop of an mdma trip.  Although I personally do not like MDPV, when used in conjunction with this chem, I think it is an excellent enhancer.  I would also say, that I would never recommend insufflating MDPV under any circumstances.  Particularly when mixing.  It seems 20mg MDPV/Dextrose mix which is a 33% concentration of mdpv is a good amount to get the rolliness going.


I will be experimenting with other chems that act on dopamine to combine that may be somewhat less iffy than MDPV.  I will report my findings when I have them.

I tried 4-MEC for the first time last saturday and I have to say, I'm not impressed. I dropped a 100 mg bomb and 40 min later snorted a 100 mg line. 

I felt a little bit stimulated and my balance was a bit off. But I experienced no euphoria and the head-space was quite boring and music didn't sound much enhanced.


Two hours after the intial dose I decided to smoke some cannabis and after that I had quite fun listening to music and dancing for ~90 min, but without the cannabis I think the whole experience would have been quite boring.


Later I went ahead and added some shrooms in the mix and got my ass kicked by them again ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

^I've had it a few times now and found it quite entertaining. I usually have 100mg orally and a 100mg line at the same time. For me the line kicks in after 5 or 10 minutes with increased energy followed by mild but definite euphoria (silly grin). With the amount that you have try half in the bomb and half snorted at the same time.


I had a wee session last week with a friend in which we got through a g between us over a period of eight hours, most of mine was insufflated and most of my friends was dabbed and we had a great time, a mix of dancing and four hour IM sessions covering three continents. After the final (admittedly chunky) line at around 1.30am we were up all night without any desire to re-dose. Needless to say we didn't sleep and felt a little jittery the next day so 1g was probably overdoing it. For me it was like a 0.5g 4-mmc session (which I know isn't so much for some folks but is quite enough for me thanks very much).

Can this be bought in the UK or is it definitely illegal? 


I am starting to think the stuff my friends have been buying from street dealers is this but being passed off as mephedrone.


I have found a supplier in the US for 4-MEC but will i have problems ordering?

**Alcohol potentiates effects of 4-mec?**


Has anyone noticed a potentiating effect with alcohol and 4-mec? I have observed this on each of the three occasions that I have tried 4-mec. The first time I took it I had a shot of alcohol after a couple of lines and it brought on the euphoria, almost as if I'd had another line. The second and third times I consumed alcohol two to three hours after my last line, at a point where I was only feeling residual effects of the 4-mec  and it brought the stimulation right back. There wasn't as much euphoria but I was certainly buzzing again. 


I know that alcohol does potentiate certain drugs but I have never experienced such a clearly defined boost before and I don't ever recall getting it with 4-mmc.

I have taken this one at dosages ranging from 200mg bombed to 315mg bombed. I have not had any luck when snorting this one..just a mild stimulation like when you snort methylone. 


For effects...it gives a nice euphoria and a little stimulation, but nothing near 4-mmc. It makes your brain a little sloppy, almost like when you take too many benzos or too many somas. very strange. 


Is it worth it? Yes I enjoyed it very much, just don't go in expecting 4-mmc as it can't compare. It is better than 4-fmc.


One major point of interest though, is that it has awesome music enhancement to it. Since the buzz is more mild, serotonin feeling(think stronger more stimulating MDAI) you wouldn't think that it would enhance music so much. I associate "rushes" from drone with making the music go off the most, but I have found with 4-mec no rushes are needed to let the music take you inside of your mind ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I have noticed that the residual stimulation from this lasts much longer than with 4-mmc. After 350mg insufflated over a period of three hours I found the stimulation lasted for at least six hours after the final dose to the point where I took half a benzo to get to sleep. If I recall correctly (it has been a while) I could usually get to sleep within three or four hours of my last bump of 4-mmc. Has anyone else noticed this?

How does 4-mec compare to buphedrone? Any similarities in effects? Heard that buph lasts a good bit longer but a bit less euphoric and more speedy.

(we think what was given to us in this instance was mdpv diluted heavily in another, inert powder as we discovered texture differences in the batch).

There is not a ton of drip, obviously dependent on the amount done and it seems to allow the sinus' to rehydrate themselves quickly and effectively.

Where 4-MMC kinda felt like a can of Steel Reserve, this was more like a HoneyWeiss.  It also, from the very beginning felt better.  I mean that in the purely psychological sense.  Without knowing hardly anything about it or what to expect, it just created a better, safer(mentally, no idea about toxicity), less sketchy mindset and overall mood.  The only people who seemed to not care for it were those people who had been at the drone game longest (one in excess of 12 months of daily use).  They found it to be weak and uninteresting and just 'not the same' as 4-MMC.  These people switched back to the other batch of horrid drone and really didn't ever want to do the 4-MEC.  I have a theory as to why, which I will explain later.

I ate 300mg dissolved in Diet Coke (when eating drone, I would typically do 200-300 orally depending on quality, and then bump 100 to carry through until it hits) and was going to bump to get going but in getting bumps lined up for others I became distracted.  Before I knew it I was out of my mind with euphoria.  MY eyes were everywhere, I had a big ass grin on my face and I couldn't keep focused on one thing very long.  I felt like I had eaten a couple of very strong hits of x.  I was amazed.  Even more so because I had been putting the stuff up my nose in 100mg shots every hour or so for a day and a half.  I couldn't believe that it caused such a euphoria and altogether rolling vibe.  I never got around to doing the starter line I had intended.  I kept thinking about it (drone habit, is it time for another line yet?) but kept realizing I was still just as good and didn't need to do any more.  That lasted for 3.5-4 hours.

If there were MDMA, you would be able to see it amongst the fluffy structure of this stuff.

The comedown was easy, no tweaky, fiending, sketched out mode as I often found with MMC.  There was energy but not speediness and it was relatively easily slept on.  I didn't notice significant side effects such as vasoconstriction and the hot flashes that go along with MMC.  It also didn't come with the delirious 'droned out' mental state that goes along with higher doses.  It felt happy, enjoyable, and good.  It didn't leave me feeling sketchy and fiendy, a sensation that has accompanied MMC from the very beginning.

They both act on nor-epinephrine, but MMC triggers dopamine in high amounts and little serotonin, MEC gives you little dopamine and high amounts of serotonin.  This would account for a number of things that I noticed to be different in the experience.  The obvious would be the euphoria of MEC compared to MMC.  The second, and arguably most relevant to this thread would be the disinterest in MEC by several HEAVY and long term MMC users.  I would guess MEC is boring to them, or 'just not the same' because they are not being rewarded by a dopamine rush.  I can't fathom why anyone would have reverted back to the crappy drone we had gotten after trying this, until I think about it from a chemical dependence/tolerance standpoint.

It has a definitively more 'lovey' MDMA type feel, to the point that if given MEC as MDMA in an oral dose, I would likely not be able to notice the difference.  And that is something that I have been wanting to say for a long time, lol.  Life goal #369 completed.

Most of the people who prefer MDMA dislike MMC until given an opportunity to eat it leading to that 'rolling' feeling, but are still left fiending and disappointed in the duration.  MEC taken orally is extremely powerful to those people who prefer a serotonin high over a dopamine rush.

Body exhaustion that is likely somewhat overstated because of the type of sleep schedule present over the two weeks prior (a few days on, one off...).  There seems to be no hangover depression or afterglow.  It doesn't 'feel' like it was significantly damaging as MDMA and MMC do sometimes.  And the psychological thought process is one of looking back fondly on the experience and wanting to try it again.  MMC never made me look back at the experience fondly, it was fun but it always left me feeling a little sketchy and dirty.  It also seemed to draw the sketchy people out of the woodwork.  I don't get that feeling with MEC and I don't fear seeing the sketchy people coming around because of it.  That is possibly the best part of it in comparison to MMC for me personally.  I don't feel like I am doing something dirty or grimy.  I don't feel like a fiend.

Yup, that's been my experience as well. I'd say it was one of the only times in my drug-days that I've ever experienced unpleasant "residual stimulation". (All the others being related to coke usage..)

if the crystal stuff ive been getting recently is 4-mec, which i very much suspect it is, its like a slightly toned down version of drone, with a much less harsh come down and side effects. i like it very much. just as compulsive as drone, infact ive been going through a lot more of this stuff due to knowing the come down wont be half as harsh. its a damn sight better than some of the pathetically weak shit that was doing the rounds

Both 4MMC and 4MEC are class B in the UK.


However 4MEC may remain legal in more countries than 4MMC.  4MEC appears to be flooding the UK also.


Opinions vary from "banging stuff dood, bst since ban" to "Not quite Maccy D's but not far off" to "sucks, not the real deal"


IME:


-Less rush/slap

-no/little music app

-shorter duration/maybe it lingers more as SWIM had alot of trouble sleeping last time

-less clear headed/stimmy


peace.

i take my comment back, the shit is horrible and you have to snort 300mg at once to even get near 100mg of mephedrone got you. Plus it burns like fuck, smells disgusting and is just nasty (worse than 4mmc)

**4-FA 4-MMC 4-MEC Methalyone**


Ah-hoy-hoy swimmers,


I have recently purchased 4-FA, 4-MMC, 4-MEC, Methalyone, and a couple cannabanoids (AMs and JWHs)


Just wondering if anyone a bit more well versed on chem. than I could let me know of any potential drug interactions here?


Also if somone could let me know the sugested dosages for a 210LB Male who has a good bit of stimulant experience. (both insuffilated and oral plz)


Lastly, any recomendations for a "coctail" combo in capsule form would be awesome I.E.


( 200Mg MMC 200Mg Methalyone 100MG 4-FA )   for example


Im looking for a stimmulated (but not jittery) euphoric kinda warm and fuzzy type high.

Have you tried bombing it? 200mg in a rizla with maybe a 100mg toot to assist the come up works fine for me.

**4-MEC Is far from 4-MMC**


Yea, looks like another failed attempt at a mephedrone replacement I snorted and bombed plenty and while I felt awake I was also more jittery than with 4-mmc and virtually  no euphoria. Well, mild when compared to 4-mmc anyway. I will say comedown/ aftereffects are almost non existent so there's at least that. It may have some functionality as a work aide or pick me up but i would suggest bombing as sniffing it can be very moreish.


Hope that is some help

Umm sure if you got 20 or so t'piss away. It's fairly clean at least but not all too enjoyable. (Minimal dopemegenic activity) but who bloody knows right? horses for courses and while i may not like it  for you it may be the best thing since 5-MEo-DMT

Anyone notice that this new big crystal type has a faint drone smell to it? Makes you wonder if it isn't half and half or a bit of slip up or something. I noticed immediate stimulation that was lacking in the non meph smelling type.

Umm it does smell like meph yes, but not as strong and subsequently the effects are not like meph in the sense in lacks the euphoria, the empathogenic effects and the tactile sensations meph will give you. You will be stimulated tho, but I get very stimulated from 4-FA and it smells/looks nothing like meph so I don't know if stimulation is particularly related to the smell.

^^Exactly...and less duration of peak/comedown. I feel that 6-APB is more like MDA for obvious reasons but I would be nervous trying out a 6-APB 4-mec combo...might cause some serotonin problems.

Don't know if 4-mec would do much for you at a rave, not on its own anyway, although at higher doses it does give fairly decent music appreciation, but nothing like meph or mdma. The reason I don't think it would fare well at a rave is because it doesn't give energy, it's really more for a night in with the lads. If you are going to use it, try it out a week or two before the rave so you can work out your dose, initial dose is very important I have found.

It seems to take on or adapt to the character of the event somewhat. I've had highly empathic sessions with it with friends where we've just sat and talked all night, albeit with lots of moving around and building playlists. One on one with my partner it has been very touchy feely but also energizing. I think that the two constants for me have been music and communication, so I would love the opportunity to try it at a rave. ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

Actually I'm going to a concert soon and am trying to decide between 4-mec, mdpv and methylone. There will be a lot of dancing involved. Despite what I said earlier I'm thinking 4-mec? Methylone is a bit hard for me to get recently and mdpv is known to be quite dangerous. Would you choose 4-mec as your concert drug? Or something not on the list?

Although I personally do not like MDPV, when used in conjunction with this chem, I think it is an excellent enhancer.  I would also say, that I would never recommend insufflating MDPV under any circumstances.  Particularly when mixing.  It seems 20mg MDPV/Dextrose mix which is a 33% concentration of mdpv is a good amount to get the rolliness going.

^ warning! read the thread BL'ers! this info changes the nature ogf the whole previous post!

Not saying it wasn't a decent post! 

merely it is not a report of 4-mec but a report of 4-mec with MDPV in combination - a whole different ball ame due to the apparently powerful effects of MDPV, and the reported weakness of 4-mec!!

This stuff is weird it's not really very enjoyable. I put 250mg in a drink and it floored me for about an hour and a half. My eyes did the wobble thing I thought they were kind of crossing at times. It's just fucks you up no rush really no empathy not euphoric at all. I felt like I was ready to sleep 2 hours later but had only been up 8 hours. I order 4-mmc and got 4-mec after taking it I felt no need for more and asked the vendor if it was 4-mec he said yes. 


Will I take it again yes I'm stuck with another gram and a half. I guess I'm going to try and mix it with some M-1 anyone ever try it mixed with M-1 I would really love any feedback. I would not buy it again it's kind of lame


PS in case it matters I have never done Meph

This has recently become one of my favorites.  I take a small amount oral, 50-100 mg, and then insuflate 50-70mg lines up to around 300 mg total.


It gives me a very sedate euphoria and enhances music amazingly.  I sit back, my eyes roll around, I shut them and chill out to ambient type music and it is an incredible almost meditative experience.


However, after that's all done (around 30-45 minutes great time per line) I feel jittery, dysphoric, anxious, tired, but unable to relax.  


What would help the comedown?  I guess my question is should I be treating this more like an amp comedown (usually take zolpidem) or an MDMA type comedown?  Would melatonin be safe to help sleep later?  Benzos?  any advice?


thanks!

treat it like an MDMA or 2c come down in my opinion. some benzos are perfect for me.


theres apparently some 4mmc making its rounds in the USA thats either cut with, or completely 4mec. so watch out if you are picking up drone...

Thanks!


Any idea on the activity of this one - monoamine reuptake inhibitor, or more releaser?  Wonder about the ratio of effects on dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin.  Any more info available anywhere that anybody knows about?  


I'm also wondering about long-term neurotoxicty similar to MDMA and/or effects on heart valves etc.  I'm sure nobody has any data on that though but educated guesses are welcome!

some of the tox. from MDMA is from its metabolites, not just its effects.

4mec is obviously more serotonergic than 4mmc, less dopmanergic and no clue about NE. 


if it acts as ethcathinone does than 4-mec is metabolized into 4-MC which (if following the rules of amps) is more serotonergic than 4mmc. 

4mec is to MDA, what 4mmc is to MDMA.

Is it likely that the effects of this will be diminished if I have consumed 5/6apb recently?

This stuff is weird. An initial 150mg bomb did absolutely nothing, 60mg insufflated provided a nice warm buzz for about 20min, then tailed off. Redosing did not do anything to bring back the slight euphoria/music appreciation obtained from the first line. 


I thought maybe my oral dose was too low the first time, so on a separate occasion, I bombed 400mg. Started to come up about 20 min in but did not take off as I expected it to and after ~45 min was just left with slight dysphoria and stimulation.

I even tried boosting it with 4-FA to no avail, and didn't feel anything from the 4-FA either (not that its anything special). 


Don't know what people are talking about having great euphoria and this being better than meph.. not even close. Smells like it though.


Perhaps it is extremely dose dependent and you have to find the right dosage for you?

ive tried this stuff a few times more since my last posts and i do NOT like it as much anymore. it has way too many unpleasant side effects, not many positives.

the entire experience feels like a 2c-i body high, along with the anxiety. the euphoria is comparable to light 4mmc, and the stimulation is hardly any. not very fun. it got my heart racing a ton, had some swelling in my throat, lots of muscle twitches. not the best stuff.

no i took it orally. i do not snort chems anymore for various reasons. the swelling was just a fight-or-flight type of reaction to the anxiety caused by 4mec, same with the muscle tension and twitches. not to mention the anxiety it caused, led to exponentially more anxiety because of the negative physical reactions. its too bad, i used to think 4mec was a winner. but it just cant hold its own IMO.

Ill have the chance to test this subst this weekend. Sounds similar to mephedrone but better and more stimulation. One time i did get to try this "ecstacy replacement" which i believed to be piperazine or a type of cathinone i hadnt tried yet. First couple of initial doses felt remarkably like mdxx but after redosing a couple times couldnt reach that point again.

This is very tweaky and feels quite cardiotoxic compared to mephedrone. I would NOT recommend this substance to anyone.

My fiancé and I find that snorting 100mg lines every hour or two is perfect. In our opinion it's better than 4-mmc. More euphoric and has much less of a comedown. This evening we're trying 4-mmc and 4-mec together. So far their's been great results. I'll post later with an update.

I recently acquired some 4-MEC, and I thought i might as well test it out as here where i live, (country wise) everything is shit pills, and you can pretty much get nothing else other than Meth. **snip** I find that when snorted it gives you a completely different buzz to dropping it.saying that i was dropping it in 300mg doses and proberly 100mg lines. and wow i loved it and so did everyone i gave it to...... we allthough it was slose tO MDMA but the effects not lasting as long, ive taken it 3 times now with no comedown, and think its awsome.


to the people that rekon it's shit, you must be getting some crap stuff or just too picky when it comes to RC's....ive tried them all and rate this one pretty up there for buzz and comedown as there is no comedown.....


If you can get ya hands on it, do a 300mg cap and you'll have a whale of a time....


Too the guy who wrote that massive post on page 3, Thumbs up for sure exactly how i felt and would rate it


Put ya hands in the air like ya just dont mind....

I found it pretty interesting actually. The first time I tried it I did 1g in a night, the next day I had a massive emotional comedown - crying, feelings of emptiness, depressing thoughts etc. Then the next time I did around 2.5g overnight, then went to sleep, woke up and everything was fine. Ever since I haven't had a comedown from 4mec. Same goes for my friend, the second time I tried it (2.5g) was her first time and she felt horrible the next day, but never again felt a comedown from it after that. Peculiar.

Plugging 200mg of this feels so fucking good. Such a nice rush. Made me grin like nothing else has for a long time. Other than that coming up feeling/rush it's nothing special.

its the same shit that they have put in jolly green granules.....without binder of course.  should  be shards.  an acetone wash should make it totally clear, making it look like meth.  sometimes its brown though and depending on the isomer that can be BETTER.  


4BMC is said to basically be half as strong as m1.  right now 4mec 4emc bmc.....are all mephedrone skeletons that are being tweaked.  sadly not much has come along with analogs of bk mdma.  ethylone and butylone are utter fucking shit in my opinion, whereas m1 was the most wonderful thing ever.  


MDEA is somehow not the same and mdec(ethyl cathinone)  BUT when subbing it into the meph skeleton it actually creates something a bit like m1 since its basically wicked weak meph.  hehe.

4-MEC IV is really wierd in my opinion. It gives a crazy fucking rush that isn't all that pleasant, my eyes start twitching uncontrollably. I also found that I blacked out.


I could be confusing this with another research stimulant but I'm pretty sure it was this one.

^ Though we don't know much about it's pharmacology, it's quite possible that an SSRI would have a severe impact on the effects as it does feel very serotonergic. 


Methylone and 4-MEC was a good combo, ~150mg of each with another 100mg of methylone at 1 hour and I was having a beautiful night... very relaxing, actually. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


I've only just started experimenting, but from what I've read (including the product mixed with MDPV post earlier on in this thread) it seems as though 4-MEC is better when combined with other substances that give it a bit more push. You need to be careful doing this though, of course.

Its more serotonin affecting than dopamine. Thats kinda why theres a lot of mda feel to it. Even though I think its nothing like mda. Its ok but it got my a pretty badinfection so I dont like it and wouldn't touch the garbage even though it felt really nice the gross dysphoria and illness sucked asss. Anyway yea its more serotonin feeling IMO

first post so hey there! 

4-mec gives both the situmulation and the euphoria. but there is just something not right with it. the effects are not as comfortable as you have like the 4-mmc legend or the bk-mdma. Still preferable as a legal substance. the thing is bombing also works well but as I've always been a conservative (irrational sometimes) snorter i didnt get the same boost with bombing. and i must add, it really screws my nasal way. regarding the nasal way, nothing is more comfortable than bk-mdma. I highly recommend to mix it with bk-mdma. in conclusion, a little tricky substance but quite preferable in this dark ages ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I was a HEAVY meph user when it was around *tear, and now I use 4FA pretty often, which isn't really anything like good ol meph, but I like it as far as RC's go, so I might try and order some 4MEC, sounds like the price is right from all of these accounts.  Thank you everyone for your detailed descriptions!


p.s.- on a side note, I still haven't been able to find anything that made me as horny as meph did- i miss that fuck everything feeling!

Alright, I think this is one of my first five posts, so I wouldn't even blame anyone for thinking I'm a shill, but here goes anyway: 


I LOVE 4-MMC. Love it, absolutely hands down my favorite party drug to socialize with (MDMA/4-AcO-DMT are my all times favorites period, but more for raves and meditation, respectively). But I also live in the USA, and getting it is a huge hassle which has kept my consumption down to almost zero (probably good, seeing as how I love it so much and its so moreish). I saw this and decided to give it a shot. Bought a gram, sold most to a friend who wanted it more than me. but tried a ~50 mg line with 30 mg MXE. It was fun, but a lot of the euphoria was the MEC.


Then I got another few grams, this time deciding I'd keep it for myself. I did about 90 mg with minimal effect, and was hugely disappointed. 120, still barely even felt anything. Big yellow crystals, well-reviewed source, definitely real stuff.


Well, last night me and my girl were just hanging out with some netflix. We decided to try a double dose before totally giving up on this drug. So I measured out 200 mg for us each, and we railed 'em.


Oh. My. GOD. The burn was EVIL and horrible, but once it wore off (bout 5 minutes) to an ignorable level, the rush was JUST like 4-MMC. Well, okay, not quite as insane, but about 80% the euphoria, the rush, the shivers, and overall amazing quality.


We did another 150 mg line every 2 hours...heavenly. Beautiful. Gorgeous. If I had known it would be this great, I wouldn't have deliberated for so long before purchasing.


The only downside is having to snort so much to get an effect, its so painful. Worth it though.

Thanks for all the reports on 4-mec, its interesting how some people are disappointed by it and some think its pretty good.  Sounds like the verdict is that railing 150mg+ doses provides the best rush.  I'm wondering though whether a bigger oral dose might not give a similarly good rush, or is it that the two experiences are qualitatively different i.e. a heroic oral dose will still not be as good as a railed dose..  Any insights on this?


Edit:  I just read back through the thread and sounds like railing and bombing are qualitatively different no matter what the dose.  I'll report back on the difference once i've had the chance to try both.

I've experienced near-blacking out from high doses of methylone, like periods where I went deaf and or blind.  Literally.


But I realize your question was in reference to 4-MEC (not methylone)

After going through 500mg of 4-MEC in about 2 weeks, I'd give it a 7/10 as an RC, 10 being MXE or 2c-e and 0 by bromo-dragonfly or something. It's fairly unremarkable. If on a friday night I had no molly or coke and I had the chance to get my hands on it for a good price or I was offered some, I would put it in my nose happily. But it's really nothing that special.

Would you care to tell the dosage? It sounds to me like an overdose, and I want to try IV-ing this too.

The massive post on page 3 was written some time ago and I first found it in a bluelight archive (4-mec page), it was well written but the author later posted in that thread that his dose was cut with MPDV (i think thats the abbr.) MPDV being a heavy stimulant even stronger than street meth, now banned.  This was what gave the 4-mec the extra speedy roll like sensations.

Its not like mdma or coke. It does make you horny but nowhere near meth horniness. Thats a bad comparison for this substance and iv 4-mec ia very nasty. I know it can give you infections if you snort it why IV it?! I always found this to be like a mellow speed with a nice nice headspace. Not like coke or mdma though.

This sounds very biased, how do you know 4-mec is more likely to give you infections? That has more to do with your current immunity system, how does snorting 4-mec give infection..?

It is sedating in a way yea. My comment is Not biased, look in older posts. I got a nasty infection from snorting this stuff, and I mean Nasty.


Its not illegal. Its legal as of right now. IV is not safe. Research Chemicals are really sketchy to IV unless you have had your product tested and know the purity is very High up there. Some Chemicals are not meant for IV and I can tell you MEC is not worth the hassle.

My experience with IV 4-MEC was horrible. It was very intense (but not in a good way like IV coke or MDPV). I'm talking about involuntary eye movement, a sense of dread, and a lot of stimulation followed by weird periods where I'd black out.

Some have I think, but not that many.  Those links showed states that ban some synthetic cannabinoids and some substituted cathinones.  However, most states haven't outlawed this one.

I would look up the half life of abilify, skip like 3 doses and go from there.  right after your fun get back on the regiment or you could risk falling into a semi withdrawal / semi medicated world where strange things happen.

1st post but have a lot of experiences with 4-MEC (regrettably) as its the main ingredient in pills these days in my location. Intra nasally and orally taken is good. However I find that doing lines is kinda like coke, get an insane rush after doing it, love everything, feel top of the world etc. Feel good for the next hour or two then the comedown which after doing it quite a bit, becomes terrible. Orally however, bigger dosage obviously but lasts a lot longer and hits me differently. I can barely talk, sedated as others were saying and I'll be up till the sun comes up without a problem. Come downs are no fun either after the first 10 times I found. At first I had no comedown but now I get depressed, anxious, can't sleep, and terrible heart palpitations. I've stopped taking it as I started having anxiety problems due to abuse really. But all in all mdma or meph is a lot better. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

So this is confirmed as the stuff that was in Jolly Green Granules?  (Thread elsewhere on Bluelight.)  I found they worked pretty well, but I did need to bomb upwards of 300mg, maybe more towards 400mg in one shot.  At that dosage, they were pretty intense and pretty much on a level with meph.

**4Mec warning.**


I just finished up a 1 week 4mec binge and I have to say that it is the most addictive thing I have ever tried. You start of doing 60mg lines for a 1 hour high and by the of a few days your goona be doing 200mg doses to feel good for a few minutes. I have a very unadictive personality no problem with cocaine smoking or drinking. 4mec is much more addictive than cocaine. I would recommend any one thinking of trying it stays away and sticks to good old MDMA.

My god, I think this was the stuff I tried a while ago (I snorted some legal RC, but I didn't know what it was called - the infamous "bath salts, plant feed" - branded RC's - "Ivory wave, K2, Magic" - you get the drill) . 


Up til' now I thought it was 3,4-dmmc.


Could somebody maybe read my trip report and tell me if they identify any of the feelings as those of 4-mec? I have been dying to know what the substance I tried was.

i recently recieved some 4MEC crystals from a very reputable UK vendor. it was white, extremely fluffy and you can see the shards (crystals) in with the poweder chunks. they look like quartz cylinders really. i made the mistake of doing my first trial line, a 100 mg rail and i didnt break the shards into dust (ouch!) plus my throat and sinuses were extremely dry. it felt like sandpaper on the drip. but nothing too crazy, this was the harshest experience i had with it and i never had a nose bleed or anything. just alot of discomfort, possibly hives of some sort?

Yeah I found that very helpful.. I now have some mec with me so I'll snort a line or two or three, probably next week, I like this ROA unless its extremely painful, which shouldnt be. Sounds good, if its not too stimulating but still a bit, and euphoric and good music is a requirement for me..

To be honest it gets a bad rep in terms of effect. I LOVE that 4-MEC mongy headspace. Its really good for sex too. The only bad part is the Sinuses. I got pnemonia from snorting and not cleaning sinuses out after. Its best to have nasal solution by you. Snorting it is the ONLY way to get a worthwhile experience too. I have had a lot of different mec but the best kind seemed to look like crystals...molly crystals...if I had to compare that you have to break down into a white powder. I think whatever the yellow rice shit was Sucked asss.

has anybody who has experimented a descent amount with 4MEC noticed having tightness in your legs after using? i just did a normal sized dose up the nose and everything went well as expected, but sometimes i notice my legs kinda feel extra achy afterwards. kinda feels like there isnt as much circulation as their needs to be, but thats just a guess. could just be muscle stiffness or something? thanks if anyone can shed some light on this unwanted side effect. its the only one i have that actually bothers me enough to make mention of. all in all 4mec seems to be very clean in moderate doses with minimal unwanted side effects. thanks guys

ok thanks man. i just looked it up on wiki and that sounds likely. it says amphetamines, or stimulants in general can cause it. im gonna take 2 baby aspirin and see if that will dilate my arteries back open to a normal size. my legs arent turning colors or anything crazy but its a slight discomfort at this point. i may want to consider asprin or something as a regular side kick, since i seem to be less resilient to it. ill update on if it works, im also about to do one more of the same line so well see what happens. thanks folley

What about mixing with LSD? I know it sounds a bit weird, both are heavy serotonin based but somehow it sounds safer to me than mixing with some stronger stim. I'm going to trip this weekend and was thinking it could cause nice euphoria.

This stuff is great. Two lines of this stuff incredibly relaxing. Just makes me want to lay down, close my eyes, and enjoy the amazing pleasure the high gives. 


Can sleep afterwards, and no hangover (maybe just a bit of anxiety the following morning).


Great stuff.

**4-Mec best Roa**


Im going to be researching some more 4mec in a few days and was wondering if anyone tried it by itself iv wise. Tried it before but was mixed with mdpv.

Looking for dosage advice and experience reports. 

Last time i did mild effects were felt but dosage was low. I know some batches are different then others but this batch is going to be decent sized crystals.

havent done oral route and am looking for a good euphoria.


share experiences please even with multiple ROA's.


thanks much

Well, I (foolishly) *only* used 4-MEC intravenously... I believe I started out with 50mg/shot, but quickly upped the dosage-and had I not been so fucking *wrecked* from IV MDPV/cocaine, I would have just thrown that crap out.


See, I really would not suggest that you IV this stuff (or any RC for that matter), firstly, no one really knows the long term effects of 4-MEC use, and intravenous self administration certainly has not been researched as far as I know. ***Secondly, the rush is fucking scary.***


I've heard a few other people that had similar experiences when IV'ing this drug, and then others who claimed to get no rush. 


What I experienced felt very fucked up, but not in an out of this world, bell-ringing, projectile vomit inducing way, but rather I spent a whole lot of time thinking "what the fuck have I just put in my body, and will I pay dearly for this?"..Anyway, after I injected this garbage, my heart rate began to increase (much like it does with other IV stims) and I started to lose control of my eye movement. It was as if my eyeballs went into some type of freakish convulsions, because they began to dart back and forth, scanning the room I was in, jerking around so that I experienced it in a way similar to stop motion animations look (or anything filmed with a slow shutter speed).


After the rush I would start to nod, and then black out..needless to say, this was not what I was looking for.


I don't now abut other roa's but I can't imagine this drug being enjoyable at all. Trash it.

I've IV'd it, it gets really tiring because of no stimulation, it does cause a lot of audio distortion though. I haven't tried any other ROA's, I.V. does feel gross though.

Well out of the 2 roa I tried snorting, besides the extreme painfull sensation, was totally worthless. 

The effects were at best with oral administration and even that was enough to never buy again. 

In combo with 4-FA there was something interesting going on but mainly as adding some fucked upness to the exp. 

The by Zneg mentioned eye movement were noticed in this combo. 


This as stand alone drug really sucks imo.

4-MEC feels fucking nasty at higher doses (which are lower than similar drugs, 4-mmc, etc)..


Tiny lines / bombs are ok.. but yeah seriously.. 4-MEC is shit.

I have noticed after a few good administrations oraly the mec dosent produce quite the effect. Had not tried it orally yet but am going to tomorrow.

Myself have had that eyeball convulsion thing. Eyes darting back and forth with rapid heart beat on larger iv doses of 4fa and sometimes apvp. Apvp is very dose sensitive when it comes to iv and produces extreme paranoia(depending on the dose and batch)


Though i am curious how intramuscular 4mec would be. Am not sure about the bioavailability of it. Apvp intramuscular is pretty good though . smoother less negative side effects and dont have to worry about an od as much. Note that when on 4mec, seems after a few administrations the effect is significantly reduced. yet to try it oral roa but am going to tomorrow when i get my batch.

Yeah i had the eyeball flutter back and forth thing on iv use with fa and pvp. Though different batches of pvp like crystal are more friendly to me imo.

pvp intramuscular is the shit though. Longer lasting. less paranoia . With white batch of pvp seemed to get a prolonged adrenaline effect. Especially if someone pissed me off then i would be high for hours on end.


far as mec. It might be decent intramuscular . Tried it with pentedrone but very little effect though am unsure about the bioavailability.

Seems though as well after a few administrations of 4mec intranasaly it loses its desired effects. Crystal version was used but i do wonder what the intramuscular would do.

Yeah more than doze off, I would straight up pass out, in a fashion similar to nodding out on some gnarly heroin. I'm surprised that people experienced this with 4-FA, because I shot pretty massive dosages of that too, without experiencing that side effect. 4-FA is also not really stimulating IME, in fact it's almost calming to the point where it could be sedating, but its a much better experience.


I wonder for those of you who did experience this effect with a-pvp and 4-Fluoroamphetamine, if you were actually sold 4-MEC instead. Although I suppose I could say the same in reverse too. This is what I don't like about RC's, I trusted the vendor I used, but in the end who knows? I'm going to believe that what I got was what was advertised based on the fact that the MDPV they sold was not only definitely PV, but very good PV (3-5mg IV shots had me tweaking for hours-*in the beginning*).


Learn from my mistakes, and many others, think twice before shooting any RC, and at least do an allergy test first through a different ROA.

I have found it takes a bit of redosing or a couple big doses to get me up. Other wise a bump or two seems to level me out. Not sedate me but more like make my mind normal. Maybe then again im add or something could have to do with it.

Wow. Either you've not tried many euphoria-inducing drugs, or 4-MEC has got a lot lot better since I last tried it.

This shit is nuts, I ordered a gram of it and it must've been some garbage ass shit because I did the entire gram that day and did nothing but feel tired, well 3 days later I check my mail and find another gram in my mailbox.  So I wait 2 or 3 weeks, as I had about a gram of meth, well last week I was doing small lines of it to keep me going, I was in opiate withdrawal.  Today I woke up with nothing, no drugs and decided to try this 4-MEC again, I did a line and holy fucking shit.  I feel like i'm rolling balls, I haven't taken any X in 4-5 years, the only downside is the jittery feeling you get.  I don't know what the deal with this shit is, sometimes it gets you fucked up, sometimes you're just left bored as fuck.

Welp, just ordered a gram despite not finding MEC very enjoyable in the past.  (Just needed a 4-FA substitute quick and this was what I found).  Perhaps the brownish stuff I had before was crap and these boulders/shards will be better?  One can hope.  Should be here tomorrow so I'll update then.  Planning to combine it with a small amount of propylhexedrine to counteract the zombified/drowsy feel.  


@MajicBLUE: I've noticed the same thing.  The first time I tried 4-MEC I h-a-t-e-d it, but found myself re-dosing like mad.  Eventually the effects weren't so bad.  (Though still not great).

@Lady Codone:  How was it?  I got a gram and it burnt like a motherfucker, and I didn't really feel anything.  Well another gram arrives for free, mind you, so I do it.  Cut out a fat ass line like probably 300mg's, and did it when I got up.  I felt it and was doing lines all day, it didn't burn nearly as bad.  I don't like cold, sweaty hands though.  But a good amp substitute.

Just did my first line (small) and it's not too bad!  Not as much dopamine/stimulation as 4-FA but better than nothing.  This stuff looks a lot cleaner than the other batch I had a year or so ago.  The smell gave me an instant flashback to my mephedrone days...not good.  Absolutely no burn compared to 4-FA, which is the most caustic shit I've ever encountered.  


Also noting the laxative effect.  Holy Jeebus.

When I started fucking with 4-MEC the euphoria was pretty intense and my dosage was always around 75-150mg insufflated. The comedown wasn't bad at all and honestly made me a little tired. The rush only last an hour an half to 2 hours, but I really loved it and used it quite a bit.


Now after taking 3 weeks off, I'm getting shitty effects and am totally seeing why it gets so much hate from people. This batch of 4-MEC is from the same source and still has the same positive effects on those around me, but now I just get a dirty rush that makes me antisocial and the comedown is really bad.


I did not use any other cathinones during those 3 weeks off. Has anyone else noticed 4-MEC getting worse overtime like I'm experiencing? 


And goddamn the laxative effect is ridiculous Lady Codone LOL.

Well, I finally got the 4mec waiting more than a month ago, I began an empty stomach, I did me a capsule with 140 mg, spent 45 minutes and when she decided it was okay to eat (which is not a good idea hahaha) to finish eating I get a friend and we were ready to start the party, he did not weigh a line, in my view will have been about 60 mg, then weighing it I hize of 120mg, Holly Shit! I kicked like a donkey, a few seconds after I started INHALED senitr that he had smoked marijuana (and I had stunned) dissipating its effects, as was entering into a state of alert (or maybe it was the horrible feeling hahaha the nose) a few minutes (5 to 10) began to have vision problems, such as when a good pill is exploding, wow it is certainly something very similar to ecstasy thought at the time, spent a few minutes followed rising like there morning, I felt the style euphoric cocaine, wanted to talk and talk and talk, to reach the peak of the experience change, be silent, hardly spoke, my friend talked and talked as if nothing was wrong, I I simply shake his head and say ... If! hahaha, I actually felt very very good, just did not want to talk, I wanted to enjoy the delicious feeling, after a few minutes (to my disappointment) the effects were almost imperceptible, and there was almost no euphoria and pleasure, at 40 mins approx and I felt almost normal, my friends and made a line, this time more similar to what I use, I was like hahahaha, when I finish rushear told me, was impressed, wanted to stop talking but I could not!, without certainly surprised us 4 mec, later use a more, easily was the same size, and unfortunately disappoint me even more, was not even half of the effects that I felt the first time a complete disappointment, my friend decio go by I had to tarbajar the next day, I put some games on the pc and decided to continue the session, I took about 4 pumps with about 60 mg each and about 6 lines and 40 mg in the rest of the night (all-pass 8pm to 2:30 am, the truth is that will require a lot to still feel with a medium effect or at least worthwhile, the 4mec in my opinion is a good drug with potential, perhaps mixing it with something else is something much better, someone 4mec mixed with Meth? weekend 4Mec gorgonzola one party with some friends, so learn more about the dosages and I can make some more decent trip report, now just think of mixing it with meth!

nobody I know gets anything from this when they had tried it orally or nasally (except bad vasconstriction), but maybe their sources were bad (they seemed pretty established though). Seems to sold a lot in crystal form now. Is it vaporizable now?

Geeez. If you play your cards right this can be very euphoric, I was basically rolling my eyes.. 9 1/2 on my scale. Pure MDMA being a 10 and LSD a 10. I have never done coke or drone, amphetamines are nice. And to be honest, I have done way more downers than uppers, but still, bliss is bliss. I remember wondering how one can even feel this good.


Oddly enough, my friends and I noticed that redosing is generally more euphoric a lot than the original dose. 

Not all the redoses, this drug hits in waves it seems like, very sporadic. I feel that way with opiates too. 

Mixed this with a psychedelic tryptamine at a show, ohh my god... I couldn't have a care in the world. If I overdo it, then I take breaks. It's honestly been helping me overcome a phobia I have been struggling with recently. I hate oral alone, but mixing with insufflation later on can be g-g-g-golden. Seriously, no bad side effects even going through over a gram in a day. Other than jaw clenching to the max in high doses, but call me crazy, I sorta like that on uppers a lot, reminds me of how good I feel. I can have had bad vasoconstriction, had some recently.. But not on this stuff, don't really notice it at all. 


Are you sure you guys are getting 4-mec?

I'm not addicted, I just usually go through stages with magic with new drugs.

A couple problems though, if you are meh where you are at, I just dose more, problem solved. Which is kinda not a + in drugs.

The comedown isn't bad, if you overdo it, you'll have the bad typical comedown days. Adderall is worse for me.

Not sure if this drug can be addicting or not, psychologically obviously.

And the fiending is ridiculous and it burns like a motherfucker coming in. You don't care later on though, you just feel too good.


I generally don't like mixing it with weed till later on, I found that combination just doesn't synergize well. I sort of just look forward to it ending sometimes when I mix the two. It's nice during the comedown though. : ) this may just be me though. This drug seems to be sporadic for many, but so far everyone I know who has tried it has loved it. It's like coke meets mdma from what my frans tell me. Note: I got it for them, so it's not like they're trying to get business or some shit lolz.


This post makes me want some, I'm gonna wait it out. Careful how much you get, 'cause the critics were right, it may be gone fairly fast.


Keep in mind, the first time I did it I liked it for like 35 minutes.. After that, I've been set.


I'd tread water carefully with this stuff, I thought it was gonna suck from what I read. I've gone on a couple half day\all day binges on this. Usually by the 7th hour it's meh imo. I'd keep it under 4 hours though.


My average doses really aren't even that high.

You guys are NOT getting 4-MEC if you think this shit is euphoric. I don't even know why this thread exists. 4-MEC is an EXTREMELY mild cathinone, with an extremely short duration. Literally an hour to an hour and a half when taken orally. After that it's just GONE. It makes me sleepy after that amount of time has elapsed. Also the high is almost like being drunk, it isn't very clear headed. 


No euphoria to speak of. This has been beaten to death, everyone who knows what they're talking about knows 4-MEC is garbage.

Maybe you just respond differently. I got some beautiful open eye visuals later on and childhood memory realizations etc. And it's absolutely 4-mec, tested.

Also lasts the length you said. It's very sporadic and you have to take higher doses than like 200mg imo, after that, smooth sailing. 

It's one of the only drugs imo where the third redose is usually better than earlier. It's a weird drug though, sometimes speedy, then relaxing, then sometimes dissociating almost.. Then sometimes all three : D Not many bad side effects either, as long as you just space your redoses like 40 minutes apart.


Oh, and to be fair you said orally, orally really kinda sucks imo, like not a very fun time unless it's a small dose on top of insufflation, even then, oral basically blows.

The ROA I used with my last bit of 4-MEC was plugging. Far better than oral or insufflation.


I think tried like 150mg, it was all that was left. I barely got anything from it and concluded it isnt worth my money or time.

Oh, no idea then. I just know at points oral can actually be dysphoric and too intense with just not many positives. Pickiest ROA drug I have ever dealt with. Ah, 150mg is just a kick starter for a good night imo : D Way too easy to go b(u)y grams with this stuff, the fiending was just too ridiculous at points.

Had a little binge on this stuff yesterday. I had received a 25O mg sample a few months back , did it over 2 small sessions in 5Omg lines. Was very underwhelming , increased sex (orgasm in particular ) but that was about it.


Am really only into trypt's & phen's buy vendor I was already making an order with was offering this cheap so grabbed 1 gram along with my order. Not very experienced stim user. Have had my problems with cocaine in the past but kicked the habit. Quite a few binges with MDMA/ecstasy as well. 


Arrived yesterday. 1.2g , broke out 2 65mg lines , let my girlfriend allergy test 5mg bump and after half hour no adverse reaction so we both did our lines. INSTANT LAXATIVE. Slight rush & stimulation. We had a bunch of stuff to do so along we went on our day. 35-45 minutes later we were both fairly tired and back to baseline.


6 hours later we return home. G/f wants another line , so I busy two out around the same size as before (65mg). This is after eating a full meal. After the line I get the normal rush and slight stimulation but also have a weird dizzy feeling in my head. Not particularly unenjoyable , it was nice in a weird way. From about 6-1O we finish off what was about a gram , so 4 hours. I did like 6O-65% of it , her the rest.


Mild euphoria , fiend desire to redose , stimulated but in a very lazy way. Would get that dizzy feeling 5 min after each line then it went away. Severe cotton mouth which lead to drinking tons of water & having to urinate a lot. Laxative effect still there. Huge pupils. Slight jaw clenching. Some effects were like a roll but not quite there and not nearly as much euphoria. 


When the bag was finished I had that sad feeling like when coke runs out but not as severe. Strong desire for more that last about 45 minutes after last line. Was able to sleep only 2 hours after the last line which I found surprising. Comedown was quite mellow , just wanted to lay and close my eyes , not much anxiety like I'd usually get with other stims.


Only my 2nd experience with a cath , pentedrone being the other. I def enjoyed the 4-mec more then pentedrone but I rate it way below the other stimulant RC I've done , 4-fa. Dissapointed it led to compulsive redosing as I would of liked to try & mix 4-fa & 4-mec but oh well. I enjoy 4-fa alone quite a lot and I never get the urge to redose and have allowed it to be a bi-weekly to monthly thing , whereas I can see this stuff getting out of hand.


Overall very mild in all aspects , stimulation , euphoria & comedown. Don't hate it , but likely wont be ordering more unless the same situation presents itself (a vendor I'm already placing an order with offers it as well).


Edit - should add I didn't have anything to aid comedown. Girlfriend had a quarter of a Xanax bar and had took a Valium very early in the day (before our first line) , she also smoked some weed right before bed.  She fell asleep before me , about 1.5 hours after our last line.


Last edit - wrote this about 15 mom after waking up. Felt a bit lethargic at first but a shower and 4g of Bali kratom and I'm feeling pretty great. Should of noted I smoked cigs like a mad man on 4-mec , woke up with a sore throat. & another thing I find the crushed up crystals (4mec came in small crystals which needed crushed for insuff) clumped up inside my nostrils a lot and would stick to the inside of the straw. Nothing really else to add. Not being huge on stims I think I found what I am looking for in 4-fa and don't plan to test out anymore for a long while... While 4-mec & pentedrone both had me somewhat talkative and produced little spurts of euphoria , 4-fa is leaps and bounds above both and leaves me with basically no comedown or compulsive redosing. Should add my girlfriend was very introverted on both 4-mec & pentedrone but stimulants tend to have that effect on her , which is a shame because they make me very social. Yet to let her try 4-fa but will likely soon.

I just ordered my first 2g of this substance. My initial thoughts on research is where people said it's like coke and x. I will write a report on how it is next week.

Received 3 grams from a trusted source. Stimulants are not my thing however I was made an offer I couldn't refuse and stocked up on a small amount for testing. 


At first I was a little disappointed. However I quickly learned the proper way of dosing on this. It takes a bump or two to get you going, almost as though your body needs to adjust to the initial intake. However once you get going it is a very nice high. Reminds me very much of mdma with a hint of coke. 


It eventually stops working however if you continue to redose. Not much of a come down, no real crash to speak of besides a feeling of being a little drained the next day however this could very well be due to me continuing to redose even after I knew it would be pointless to do so. 


Personally, though I enjoy the rush, it is too short lived and personally I would not feel confident if my labs continued to research this compound, thus I decided to dump the rest of my supply as I simply have no use for it.

My first 2 grams of 4-MEC arrived today, and all four of us have enjoyed ourselves immensely. This is the 4-MEC crystals. I have felt fantastic for the most part. True, not as intense as some RC's I have tried, but my one friend shoots coke all the time and says he likes this alot, I have done lots of mephedrone in the past, I get why some people are putting this down, its because they can get something better. But this is WAY better than no drugs, and its way better than adderall/ritalin, and way stronger, for example.

so what's the deal here? is this stuff trash/ineffectual or legitimate? hearing this amount of mixed response indicates it might by interactions with other drugs people are taking, or the simple reason of  different peoples' body makeup causing the array of responses. not really interested in this stuff. just curious.

I'm not a stimulant fan, nor do i tend to use illicit (or pseudo-illicit) drugs these days.. and i know this quote is really old (from the page 1 of this thread back in 2010) when 4-MEC was still very new; & possibly being presented as something ***as*** 4-MEC when it may had been something else (given recent legislation & potential vendor left over stock of, say, mephedrone)


BUT.. the bolded part in the quote below made me laugh my ass off ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

I pretty much hate 4-MEC, but it's not too bad when combined in low doses with 2-FMA or other classic stimulants.  It combats the lethargic/drowsy feeling and makes it more euphoric.  Decent for social situations and makes me a little more chatty.


Some empathogens are just too stoning, and 4-MEC is one of them.  5ME is another.  Absolutely HATED that one.

I might sample this stuff for assistance w/ work.. 500mg batch easily & cheapily within my reach; would it be helpful? Or is it more on an empathogen?? Don't want that, really. 


Any hints on potential intro doses? addictive properties? I work w/ reading lots of material that's not interesting in telecom industry, also dealing w/ customers regularly.. & i'm trying to move up (very competitive, in a good way, there). i'm a personable individual (& always was on amphetamine & the few times I tried its stronger, preferable methyl-cousin, too), so not worrying about going off on someone under stim influence.. But, i never had a "problem" with stimulants. All that shit happened w/ opiates/opioids years after i was dicking around w/ stimulants (although, i did concurrently use cocaine if my drug of choice, heroin and/or fentanyl, was plentiful at times when able- but could take it or leave it; hated not being able to sleep).


I am currently stimulant naive.. haven't used any stimulant in at least 6 years; but prior to that. I could down a teener (1/16th of one ounce) of cocaine in 12 hours, or around an eight (err, eightball -  1/8 of one ounce) when i was banging dope ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png) 


Tolerance to amphetamine was usually around 40-60mg to get my jollies off & fuck till my dick hurt.. (ratio of D isomer to L isomer was 1:4, obvious what pharmaceutical formula that is ![:p](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)) It should be noted I have no cath. experience. Only amphetamines & phenethylamines when it comes to stimulants.

I remember I accidentaly shot up 4-MEC thinking it was 4-MMC once, it sucked. It felt like 4-MMC with all the side effects and no euphoria...

I'm pretty sure the "snow blow" they sell in dublin which is supposed to be 4mmc is actually 4mec. I wouldn't be a fan.

Apologies for the necro.


Just found out that my source for 4mmc was likely selling me 4mec. This is causing me to question if ive ever actually used mephedron, or if its all been 4mec. In all honesty, its changed my opinion on 4mec quite a bit, as ive appparently had some great times while on it, thinking it was meph.


Just some food for thought

You would know the difference, its not subtle. Ive blown upwards of 70+ grams of 4mmc in my life, and tried 4-MEC on multiple occasions. If you actually get what you think you are getting, from a trusted reliable source, they are much different. Like a previous poster said, 4MEC is all of the side effects of 4mmc, without any real euphoria or stimulation. Dont confuse euphoria with "empathogenic" or serotonergic. This stuff is horrible. This isnt even the poor mans version of 4mmc, its just crap. Obviously thats just my opinion, however Ive tried MANY many different RCs and I say with certainty this is the worst. 


All it did was cause me LOADS of anxiety, a huge serotonin rush (not the good kind. the "stoned" without the stone kind), no euphora or real stimulation. Perhaps if a very low dose of this stuff is mixed with a stimulant, say a 95/5 mix of this plus 3-mmc, it may lead to an okay mediocre time, but thats it. Id stay away from this stuff, its no inherently bad, but you may freak out on it. 


If you got real 4mmc, you would know the difference. Its a whole different world. Especially the Chinese stuff, boy oh boy, probably my favorite stim of all time.

Anyone else notice how black and white divided the opinions on 4-MEC are? Most people consider it worthless, but there is also fairly large group of people who find it VERY euphoric. 

No other RC seems to have so bipolar reviews, eg. with 4-FA all agree it's euphoric, sure some people like it less some more. MDPV has super short rush followed by crash from hell and strong urge to redose etc. and you don't see people saying complete otherwise. 

With 4-MEC it seems you either love it or hate it. And it can't be all about different vendors/batches as I have prime example in my own family - I find MEC absolutely non euphoric whilst my sister loves it. We both have pretty high tolerance to all cathinones and stims in general, yet when she takes 400mg of 4-MEC she swears it's almost as good as 4-MMC (say 200mg). I am just nauseaus as fuck from 400mg and try to get that shit out of my body as quickly as possible.


It's as if 4-MEC has the pontential to be euphoric for everyone (which it basically has as it releases tons of serotonin) but there's something in it that blocks the fun for many, if not most people.


Also let's not forget 4-MEC used to be heavily marketed as the closest replacement for 4-MMC, almost every vendor in the world offered it but it quickly became much rarer and never became heavily widespread. Many vendors lost money on it as demand was much lower than expected.

Hi guys,


I received a sample of 1000mg of 4-MEC from a vendor which I purchased a lot (almost every day for like a year now) and he gave me a generous sample of 4-MEC with an order.


What should I expect with this one? My experiences with empathogenes are pretty limited (Methylone, 5-MAPB, 6-APB, 3-MMC).


Thank you ![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif)

It's hardly like any of those you mentioned. It's mostly serotonergic with no rush and no empathy whatsoever. It makes you kind of sleepy/lethargic with some dull stimulation in the background, so you basically don't feel like doing anything, higher doses only produce side effects like nausea and vomiting.

I was clearing out my hard-drive when I found a word pad document with 4MEC notes on it from August 2011. I will just summarize it.


My first time using it gave me similar effects to mephedrone, say 65-70% 4mmc, and alot shorter duration. Redosing worked to an extent and after that it made me feel nauseated and almost poisoned. 


**Report 1**

There was the initial 'crazy rush' feeling where you think 'oh here we go', it was stimulating with that 1000mph feel, I had a huge grin on my face from ear to ear and my sense of well-being was through the roof. Slowly I got small waves of orgasmic pleasure passing through my body, lasting maybe 1-2 seconds, coming every 20-30 seconds, each orgasmic wave lasted longer and longer until it was pure bliss, it was the feeling of one long orgasm, I would close my eyes and gasp at the sheer pleasure. This then slowly faded off and I was left with music appreciation, a high ego and endless horn, maybe 75% of the 4mmc horn. A redose repeated the effects, but the orgasmic waves were half the strength.


**Report 2**

So it was 2 weeks since the above report, I took my dosage and experienced all of the above effects but the orgasmic pleasure part was maybe 50% or less of the first time. When I re dosed this time it turn me into a sloppy, mentally confused mess, like I had been drugged with a downer and I found it extremely hard to concentrate, it was a really unpleasurable place to be in and I found myself at times closing my eyes and almost 'blacking out' - I would snap back into reality and 30 minutes would have past. Not nice at all. 


**Report 3 **


6 Months after the above report, I was in a group of 5 at a party and 4-MEC was the intended chem for the night. I was the only occasional 'light user', the rest of the group were moderate street drug users. I experienced the same great effects as stated in report 1, with redosing effective with 50% of the orgasmic pleasure.


The other 4 in the group didn't respond well at all, they pretty much immediately got very sloppy, and in a confused mongy headspace. I was actually quite concerned due to the appearance of them all looking very fucked and sleepy but they didn't seem bothered and just kept on saying 'oh this stuff gets you messed up, what the hell is it, its crazy' I made sure they didn't re-dose, I was really concerned, and it took them a good 2-3 hours to come out of this state. 


Hope this helps.
