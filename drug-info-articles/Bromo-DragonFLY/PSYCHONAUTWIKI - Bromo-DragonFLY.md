**Bromo-DragonFLY is linked to an unusually large number of hospitalizations and deaths.**
 
Due to its extremely high potency and unstudied effects, it is strongly discouraged to take this substance without using the strongest [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Harm_reduction_practices) such as [volumetric dosing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Volumetric_dosing) , limiting intake to [oral ingestion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Routes_of_administration#Oral) , and using a [trip sitter](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Trip_sitter) . Please see [this section](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bromo-DragonFLY#Toxicity_and_harm_potential) for more details.
**Bromo-DragonFLY** (also known as **DOB-DragonFLY** or simply **B-DFLY** or **Dragonfly** ) is a novel [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) substance of the [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Substituted_amphetamines) and [benzodifuran](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodifuran) classes. It produces an array of extremely dose-sensitive [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) effects when [administered](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Routes_of_administration) . It was first synthesized in 1998 by Matthew Parker from [DOB-FLY](/w/index.php?title=DOB-FLY&action=edit&redlink=1) . [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

Bromo-DragonFLY is extremely potent and produces unusually long effects which reportedly can last up to several days. It is considered to have one-third the potency of [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) by weight, making it remarkably potent relative to the vast majority of psychedelics. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

Due to its high potency and unpredictable dose-response, many reports indicate that the effects of this substance may end up being overly difficult to use safely for those who are not already experienced with [hallucinogens](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hallucinogens) . Specifically, given that the dosage and duration of this substance have yet not been fully determined, users are advised to start at the lowest possible, intake only through the oral [routes of administration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Routes_of_administration) , and never re-dose during any time throughout the experience.

Very little is known about the pharmacology, metabolism and toxicity about Bromo-DragonFLY in humans. It briefly gained popularity among [research chemicals](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemicals) circa 2010 until several deaths occurred after the substance was accidentally mislabeled and sold as [2C-B-FLY](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B-FLY) , leading to its prohibition.

Bromo-DragonFLY has never been documented as being sold on the street and has seemingly stopped production on [research chemicals](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemicals) gray market. Due to its novelty and extremely short history of human usage, all information related to the use of this compound should be received with extreme caution. It is strongly recommended that one use the utmost [harm reduction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Harm_reduction) practices if choosing to take this substance.

## Chemistry

Bromo-DragonFLY is a substituted [phenethylamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamines) , [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Substituted_amphetamines) and [benzofuran](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzofuran) , featuring a phenyl ring bound to an amino (NH 2 ) group through an ethyl chain and contains a bromine atom attached to carbon R 4 . Bromo-DragonFLY is an atypical psychedelic phenethylamine which is closely analogous to [DOB](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DOB) ; it is the difuran analog to DOB, where it incorporates the methoxy groups bound to R 2 and R 5 of DOB into five member furan rings fused to the central benzene ring.

Bromo-DragonFLY belongs to a group of phenethylamine derivatives referred to as the DragonFLY compounds, named for their insect-like appearance of two “wing-like” furan rings fused on the opposite sides of the central benzene ring.

It is worth noting that the R-isomer of the molecule is considerably more active than the other and as such doses must be adjusted accordingly.

## Pharmacology

The [hallucinogenic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hallucinogenic) effect of bromo-DragonFLY is mediated by its [agonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist) activity at the 5-HT 2A serotonin receptor. Bromo-DragonFLY also has a high binding affinity for the 5-HT2B and 5-HT2C serotonin receptors, and is most accurately described as a non-subtype selective 5-HT 2 agonist, as it is actually twice as potent an agonist for 5-HT2C receptors as for 5-HT2A, as well as being less than 5x selective for 5-HT2A over 5-HT2B.

It is further suggested that Bromo-DragonFLY almost completely inhibits [MAO-A](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MAOI) activity, which makes itself unable to metabolize. This is probably the cause for an abnormal duration of action.

However, the role of these interactions and how they result in the [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) experience continues to remain elusive.

## Subjective effects

Compared to [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) , this compound presents a significantly less pronounced body high, reduced visual effects and more in-depth [hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucinations) which are comparable to [mescaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mescaline) or [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) . Despite the visual and physical effects, it reportedly tends to maintain a level of sober thought structure. As the user usually retains acute cognitive sobriety, Bromo-DragonFLY can be considered to have diminished effects of [confusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Confusion) and potential [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) when compared to [4-AcO-DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-AcO-DMT) , [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) , or [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) .

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- The physical effects of Bromo-DragonFLY are comparable to that of traditional [phenethylamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamines) such as [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) , [mescaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mescaline) and [2C-E](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-E) .

#### Geometry
 
Bromo-DragonFLY visual geometry can be described as more similar in appearance to that of [mescaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mescaline) , [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) and [2C-D](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-D) than [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) or [ayahuasca](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ayahuasca) . It can be comprehensively described through its [style variations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Geometry#Variations) as detailed in complexity, abstract in form, synthetic in style, structured in organization, brightly lit & multicoloured in scheme, glossy in shading, flat in edges, large in size, fast in speed, smooth in motion, angular in corners, non-immersive in depth and consistent in intensity. Bromo-DragonFLY has a contradictory combination of "naturalness", but also presents a "neon and digital" observation. At higher doses, users are significantly more likely to experience a state of [Level 8B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Geometry#8B_-_Exposure_to_inner_mechanics_of_consciousness) visual geometry over [Level 8A](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Geometry#8A_-_Exposure_to_semantic_concept_network) .
 
#### Hallucinatory states
 
Bromo-DragonFLY produces a full range of high level hallucinatory states in a fashion that is comparable to [mescaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mescaline) or [2C-E](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-E) . This is more consistent and reproducible than that of many other commonly used psychedelics such as [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) or [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) . It tends to occur at heavier doses and integrates seamlessly with the accompanying geometry. These effects generally include:
 
- **[Transformations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Transformations)**
- **[Internal hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucination)** ( *[autonomous entities](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Autonomous_entities)* ; *[settings, sceneries, and landscapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Settings,_sceneries,_and_landscapes)* ; *[perspective hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perspective_hallucinations)* and *[scenarios and plots](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenarios_and_plots)* ) ### Cognitive effects

## Toxicity and harm potential

Bromo-DragonFLY can be considered extremely toxic at very high dosages with several deaths and numerous hospitalizations reported on overdoses. It can also have extreme [vasoconstrictive](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction) effects, which can result in severe tissue damage or even limb amputation. Due to its high potency, one can easily overdose if this substance is not measured correctly ("eyeballed") or mislabeled as another substance.

The toxicity and long-term health effects of recreational Bromo-DragonFLY do not seem to have been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dose is unknown. This is because Bromo-DragonFLY is a [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) with very little history of human usage.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) , such as [volumetric dosing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Volumetric_dosing) , when using this substance to ensure the accurate administration of the intended dose.

### Notable deaths

On May 7, 2011, in the United States, two young adults died and several others were hospitalized after overdosing on Bromo-DragonFLY, which they believed was [2C-E](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-E) .

### Tolerance and addiction potential

Bromo-DragonFLY is not habit-forming, and the desire to use it can actually decrease with use. It is most often self-regulating.

Tolerance to the effects of Bromo-DragonFLY is built almost immediately after ingestion. After that, it takes about 6 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 14 days to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). Bromo-DragonFLY presents cross-tolerance with all [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) , meaning that after the consumption of Bromo-DragonFLY all psychedelics will have a reduced effect.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **[Lithium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_(medication))** - Lithium is commonly prescribed for the treatment of [bipolar disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder) . There is a large body of anecdotal evidence that suggests taking it with [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) significantly increases the risk of [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) and [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) . As a result, this combination is strictly discouraged.
- **[Cannabis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cannabis)** - Cannabis may have an unexpectedly strong and unpredictable synergy with the effects of Bromo-DragonFLY. Caution is advised with this combination as it can significantly increase the risk of adverse psychological reactions like [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) , and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) . Users are advised to start off with only a fraction of their normal cannabis dose and take long breaks between hits to avoid unintentional overdose.
- **[Stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants)** - Stimulants like [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) , [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) or [methylphenidate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylphenidate) affect many parts of the brain and alter [dopaminergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) function. This combination can increase the risk of [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) , and [thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops) . This interaction may also result in an elevated risk of [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) . [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol)** - Tramadol is well-documented to lower the seizure threshold and [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) may act to trigger seizures in susceptible individuals. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

### Overdose

The risk of Bromo-DragonFLY overdose is unknown at the time, suggesting that there may not be a safe dosage. Non-oral routes also seem to exhibit a higher chance of overdosing, perhaps owing to differences in bioavailability, potency and unpredictability of dosage and effects. Overdose effects of typically include bizarre, [delusional](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusion) and sometimes violent behavior, [amnesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amnesia) , [numbness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_suppression) , [confusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Confusion) and [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) . The user may not be able to communicate and can be severely agitated. At appropriately high doses, more severe side effects include [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attack) , [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) , dangerously prolonged [elevated heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate) , [blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure) and [vasoconstriction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction) . [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] Vasoconstriction typically develops to its peak several hours into the intoxication and will need medical assistance since Bromo-DragonFLY is known to do this for an extremely long time.

The abnormally long duration of Bromo-DragonFLY poses a significant risk by staying inside the body for weeks. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

In the event of an overdose, [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) can be administered to mitigate the hyper-agitative effects. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] A potent vasodilator will need to be continuously administered to prevent a hypertensive emergency, necrosis, organ failure and death from the resulting hypoxia. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] As a result, emergency medical services should always be sought in the event of an overdose.
