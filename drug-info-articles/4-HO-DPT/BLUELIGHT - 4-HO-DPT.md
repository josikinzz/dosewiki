Does anybody know anything about this compound? I've tried searching. I would assume it's active...

I would LOVE to try it!  I hope someone has experiences.  I believe there was another thread where this was brought up before but I can't find it.

There was, I saw it. No good info yet, all trip reports involve there being nothing too remarkable. To me, this suggests they didn't take enough. ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)

It seems like 4-HO-DPT would HAVE to work, considering all of the other 4-hydroxy tryptamines work and are quite good.  And since DPT is its base, I would think it would be amazing indeed, on par with but different from 4-HO-DMT.

Would be very intriguing.....though if we were t compare DMT and DPT, we'd have more success with apples and oranges (hang on, are they used as similar comparitive thingies?)....um...

When I saw this thread, my hopes were up someone had this stuff, only to have them dashed.  Sounds like a winner, and seems kind of obvious compared to some of the weird substitutions that are going around today.  Maybe I'll put some DPT in some mushroom substrate and see what happens.  Would love to try this chem though.

I have seen this chemical offered at one or two chemical supply companies.  I never bought it because I don't know what it does.  They also carry 4-AcO-DPT and 5-MeO-DPT at times, but I'm not sure how much information there is on these.


Are any of these compounds interesting?

We're not sure.  But it seems quite clear to me that 4-HO-DPT would be a winner.  All of the 4-HO-Ts are good, even ones with DiPT and MiPT on the base.  MiPT itself isn't anything to write home about.  DPT by itself IS however.  So it failt o see why 4-HO-DPT wouldn't be great.  DPT and DMT are sort of the two "kings" of the tryptamine world, and we know that 4-HO-DMT is great.  I'm surprised no one has tried 4-HO-DPT.  If I had the chance I sure would.

One would think that, extrapolating from 4-Ho-DMT and n,n,DMT that a dose of 4-HO-DPT would be less then for DPT itslf, but Shulgins diaries don't seem to conceede such. Though he does say its a difficult synth....

10mg 4-ho-dpt insufflated a little over 2 hours ago didnt do much. Some color enhancement was the only noticable effect.

my friend got a hold of some, so i decided to buy a two hits from. he told me to only take one hit, but i decided to take two, 100 mg in total. the trip went fine. i was hoping for it to be more intense, but it doesn't seem like that kind of chemical. however, the hallucinations were beautiful. unlike any that i had ever seen before, they just seemed a lot more magical than lsd or psilocybin hallucination. the most memorable of them was seeing my floor covered with little blue sparkly mushrooms growing out of the carpet. it took only about 30 minutes to fully come up. then the trip just stayed at a plateau for about two hours and then came down in about an hour. i would however, not taking any less than 100 mg. any less and it wouldn't be worth it. i would like to try maybe 150 to 200 mg though.

I tried 5mg orally just to get feel for its flavor; and it is the second most vile tasting substance I have tasted, next to 4-ho-dipt. Again, this was not an attempt at getting a buzz, just wanted to taste it...

I've had a little experience with this one.I had extremely high hopes and it is indeed active at around 18-30mg.It was somewhat reminiscent of a low dose of 5-MeO-MiPT but felt a lot like DPT, especially in the chest (heart racing a bit).Not visual at all but there is head space for sure.All in all I'd say I found it interesting enough for me to want to do again.

4-AcO-DPT (16mg insufflated in four ~4mg piles over 40 minutes).


It is comfortably sunken in DPT’s luxuriant spectrum.  There are no visuals to speak of, only the fragmented flame tips of visions.  Just now, in a lambent expanse of golden savanna grasses, I stepped through a hushed band of cerulean and rose slung through the mists of a vale clearing.   Its spaces are indistinct yet sound fully with notes of plaintive majesty.

Had a beautiful experience with 25mg insufflated 4-aco-dpt. Keep in mind that I nad 1mg of klonipin and 9mg of mdpv earlier (5 or 6 hours) in the day. Walked to a nearby rock ridge that overlooks a beautiful stream (its one of my smoking spots). Did my line out of my neat little contraption (allows outdoor insufflation both relatively discreetly and protects the powder from the wind) and just sat back. Effects were noted within 5 minutes and grew into the peak which lasted about an hour and has gently tapered down since. The visual aspect was very unique and hard to describe. The standard tryptamine trails were apparent, but the most interesting part was after a trail had passed, it would on occasion flash back, sort of like a lightning strike. Stationary objects didnt move about much, but their surfaces seemed to havea moving, translucent film over everything. No negative physical aspects were noted, and I felt remarkably centered mentally throughout. Good stuff so far... 


Maybe the 4-ho/aco-dpt threads should be merged since so little is known about either...

I'm not sure whether they should be merged or not... they are two distinct substances.  I was always annoyed that the 4-HO-DiPT and 4-AcO-DiPT threads were merged into one because those two are clearly not the same or even particularly similar.  What does everyone else think?  I know that right now there is very little information but in the future that could change.

The suggestion is to merge them until each can grown on its own. I can think of some merits from a communications perspective for keeping them together permanently (encourages comparison, keeps both topics more live), but in any case right now I think its best to have as much info as possible in one place and to keep it visible for potentially keen passers by. (wink)

I say keep them separate unless it becomes clear that their effects are substantially similar.  It would be a bitch to try and separate them after the fact.

4-ho-dpt seems to have FAR better intranasal bioavailability than 4-aco-dpt.  I must have lost a bit in the process after getting very little from 10mg previously. Last night 10mg got to a relatively solid +2, but it seemed very welcoming, more than the 4-aco (which is pretty nice itsself). Anyone else experience this???

**Kratom + 4-ho-dpt**


5g of whole leaf kratom ground into a fine powder and put in gel caps about an hour and a half before the 4-ho-dpt was ingested. Got some mild nausea from the kratom (I always do...), but it passed quickly. 10mg 4-ho-dpt was insufflated to little (though beyond placebo) effects. Mostly just color enhancement at this point.  Waited (approx) 15 minutes after the first line just to check for any odd reaction and no physical symptoms were noted. Smoked a joint before 20mg 4-ho-dpt was  insufflated. Within 3 minutes I started getting some pretty *beautiful* visual distortions and a bit of OEV patterning (a first in my trials of these dpt analogs). I got a bit nautious ans threw up once, but felt 100% better afterwords. Te rest of the day was spent watching the ominous skies (5 fullels were spotted n the area) and just relaxing with my dog. Not a special enough experience to write a full TR for, but thought you guys might like to hear the basics of the combo.

Unless kratom somehow blunted the effects or something, 4-ho-DPT seems highly variable from your experience of it. I hope to use it soon.  16mg of the AcO was certainly beyond placebo in my one trial with it, and I expect the ho to be more potent than that.  But who knows, my experiences with the same dose of DPT have also been all over the board in terms of sheer intensity.

I feel like the kratom both blunted the effects to a point, but also added something to it as well, especially visually.

I had a go way back in 2001.  4-Ho-DPT is not like the other psilocin analogues.  A bit along the generic lines, and not very potent.  I took 75mg orally and had a +++.  Not really much to write about as not much happened.  It felt DPTish, and wasn't very colorful (DPT for me is not very colorful either) and it made me curious about what an oral dose of DPT would be like.  I imagine the two to be very similar.

^I'm sorry to say I'm still sitting on the stuff.  I only have a little and really want to IM or IV it to conserve material. I've had difficulty getting it into solution in the past, though, so I'm waiting to see if others have better luck and can tell me exactly what they did. I ended up plugging one partially undissolved 16 mg mixture in an attempt to salvage a trip and got almost no effects.  


From morninggloryseed's experience it's clear that oral is a bust.  Insufflation works well but I still prefer to avoid it if IM or IV is a possibility.  


It's a lovely and unique material; it's a shame that due to its seemingly low oral bioavailability and lack of reports the only way we're ever likely to get any more is through a somewhat expensive and difficult custom synthesis.


Also, there's a small 4-AcO-DPT thread around somewhere if you didn't know about it.

Huh?

No mindfuck, pretty gentle and smooth, it felt...as I said...mostly like DPT.  Whether that is chemical suggestion or not...I'll never know.  The visuals were mild visuals as I said, not too colorful.  Mostly distortions and some color enhancement...but not much to write home about.


I was sober about 4-5 hours after I took it...so seems longer-lasting as compared to DPT.

I just tried to prepare 20 mg of a new batch for IMing and couldn't get this batch to go into solution at a pH suitable for IMing either (tried citric acid and acetic acid with heat and there's still little chunks; insufflation is definitely the route to go with this). I plugged the liquid instead to salvage it.  First effects noted in 15 minutes.   


I'm in an extremely pleasant head space right now -- about a plus 1.5 in intensity.  It reminds me of mescaline in that it's very gentle but also very deeply satisfying. It's very fine, but very rich as well. I'm going to go see a classical music concert the city is putting on in a park nearby with a few friends and I think this high will be the perfect complement to the evening. 


I'm anticipating great things in the 30 - 40 mg insufflated range.

Just had an amazing evening on 4-ho-dpt. Started the evening with some sida cordifolia tea and 1mg clonazepam. The fireworks were canceled last night due to thunderstorms, so they were held tonight. Drank the tea, smoked a bowl and snorted 36mg of 4-ho-dpt (the last of my supply![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)) on the way out the door. I live less than a mile from the venue, so we walked. I had good music (gogol bordello) on the mp3 and though there were cops everywhere, I felt at ease throughout. Just got back and am enjoying a Fat Tire. Will post full TR asap.

is nasal application really more efficient than oral with this compound? usually, this is not the case for 4-HO-substituted tryptamines, as far as I know.

I would not consider myself a hardhead with most psychedelics, especially tryptamines.  With all of the other 4-Ho-Tryptamines.... >20mg is usually sufficient.

Yes, it appears so.  MGS needed 75 mg orally to get to a +++, whereas just 16 mg gets me to the plus *.5 /++ range.  I think 35 mg snorted would be enough for a +++ snorted.  I guess maybe 4-ho-DPT is uniquely sensitive to being broken down by digestive enzymes. 35 mg plugged was more than enough for a intensely blissful +++ when combined with 17 mg aMT intramuscularly and repeated ketamine and Adderall bumps, and I'm sure insufflation is more potent than plugging. I was extremely impressed with the closed eye visuals and cognitive effects of the combo.  Perhaps egor can comment on the intesity of his 35 mg snorted trip.  


I'd really like to be able to IM this. If anyone figures out a good way to get it into solution using citric acid or acetic acid please post.  It may just be that I didn't leave it long enough to dissolve or didn't heat it enough, but I've been having trouble getting all the chunks to dissolve. If I don't get any answers I think next time I'll just force it through a micron filter and just accept the loss of the chunks as the price of using a more potent ROA.

same problem here. i am very angry about the poor water solubility of the fumarate. i also contacted the vendor to check the batch, but same thing with the new batch. imo the fumarate-form is the problem.


to force it through a micronfilter is imo a bad idea, you will loose a lot of the salt, or the filter gets broken.


better use less 4-ho-dpt or use more water. we have to check how much mg will solve in 1ml water - and then inject in more muscles to handle so much water. i think this is the best way for a first test. if IM is a good ROA, then we have to convert it in a freebase form, and from there back in a hcl-form wich hopefully has a better solubility.


/edit: or bruise it as fine as possible, sterilise it with a few drops ethanol, an IM it with sterile water without a filter?

I remember with the first batch I got about a year ago I was able to get it down to just a few chunks on the bottom with a clear solution on top by using 5 percent acetic acid and heating to near boiling and stirring for about 5 minutes.  I think you're right and it is the fumerate because that first batch was from a different supplier (though it could have also been the fumerate/same producer, I don't really know; I like the stability, though). I think I could have probably sucked the liquid off the top without getting any clogged and IM'd it, and then just plugged the chunks at the bottom so as to minimize waist (assuming the chunks would have eventually absorbed that way). Vinegar will sterilize the chemical, too, just leave it at 5 percent for a few minutes while heating then dilute it to at most 2.5 percent acetic acid before injecting because it stings (probably not as bad as ethanol, though).  You may be able to lower the pH with sodium bicarbonate, too, just add it slowly if you use vinegar to avoid a 4-ho-DPT volcano! Post back if you try either please.


I guess I'm concerned about turning it to a freebase because I'm not totally sure those chunks will dissolve in a basic solution either, at least not with the kitchen chemistry methods I can do.  They won't even dissolve in 90 percent DMSO!

Got my hands on some of this a week ago.


Then yesterday me and a friend found the time to trip and i decided to try 20-25mg (didn't have the time to weight it exactly, but must have been between 20 and 25mg) and my friend took 15mg of 2c-e.


The Come-Up of the 4-ho-dpt was pretty smooth, insufflated two lines about 15mins apart. I peaked around 20min after insufflation.Headspace stayed clear, just had some nice visual distortions: birds in a picture in my friends living room started flying around and the leaves on a tree in his backyard were butterflies opening and closing their wings. Nothing too intense though.


There was no real bodyload, just some physical stimulation and a lot of euphoria.

We smoked some marijuana on the comedown and around 3hours after ingestion I was back at baseline.


I really enjoyed this chemical and I'm looking forward to trying 35mg next week.

taken 12mg 4-ho-dpt, grinded it very fine and dissolved it with some heat in 2.5ml sterile 0.9% NaCl injectionsolution, only a very few particles remainded. Drawed it through a 0.2 ym filter, let it cool - and got a very clean transparent solution. shot it IM in both tigh's. no physical/mental discomfort. it was a very very slight nice trip, a light dpt-dreamy-state, more physical as psychedelic, it felt very safe, baseline after 1.5 - 2 hrs. i guess the real fun begins on much higher dosages. next try with 20mg ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

^I'm glad you were finely able to IM it.  I've used it six times in total now and I love it.  It's hard to believe it's taken so long for such a treasure to make its debut on the wider market. I agree that it starts showing its true colors at higher dosages.  I think by chopping up the chunks very finely and using acid and heat for a long time I'll be able to IM a 50 mg dose some day. 


I feel that 4-ho-DPT is every bit as powerful as DPT in the right setting, because last night I had a very difficult experience after I combined just 16 mg insufflated with DXM and then took 3 mL GBL while attempting to go to sleep some 3 hours after dosing. I got caught in the same experiential loops I've been trapped in by DPT in the past, this time centering around the idea of growing evermore exhausted but being unable to fall asleep. I was hoping to pass out by taking the GHB, but the 4-ho-DPT had other plans. 


I grew increasingly delirious and dizzy from the GHB as the symbolic maelstrom of luminous ideographs from 4-ho-DPT whirled around me.  I had a vision of a picture of my father as a young man, the age he was when he conceived me with my mother, floating in a miniature boat in the middle of a vast and still ocean. I was made to realize that there exists some external causality in the creation of myself, and that as punishment for my arrogance in entertaining the idea that there wasn't in the face of so much experiential evidence to the contrary I would be re-born again as a baby and be forced to live my life over from infancy. 


This series of visions and ideas repeated over and over again in my mind every few seconds.  Every time it looped over I would hear a sound sparking around me in wispy flits and flutters, like a singing saw in the dark or the music of champagne glasses in a vast space. These "sparks" were accompanied by electrical jolts, and I could see my hands spasm and tremble as I rolled around the bed during the terror of the sunrise. At the same time I was laughing manically and being buffeted by fusillades of flash-bulb ecstatic bliss. I was drowning in the joy of the wellspring of my own causality, a spiritual torture at once satisfying and mad. Finally I begged forgiveness, and immediately I felt relief. I knew I was in the presence of my “creator” and "maintainer," whatever that means, and that it would grant me solace soon.  I twitched in bed for a few minutes longer until I finally passed out.  I've only just now awakened, and have come downstairs to type this post.


I don’t mean this to be a warning to those using this substance; it seems fairly gentle in the lower dosage range. But for me it’s different. In the past my mind has shifted the nature of my DPT trips into something far more psychologically challenging than they were before in order to fulfill a new philosophical purpose I needed it for, and likewise, during this episode with 4-ho-DPT I feel that a deeper aspect of myself was able to recognize DPT’s likeness in 4-ho-DPT and exploit its properties to bring about this traumatic but extraordinarily substantial growth experience.

So yesterday I finally had the time to try this a 2nd time.


Instead of my roughly 20mg I tried last time, I decided to push it up to 28mg this time.


I again tripped with my best friend and he decided to take 15mg of 2c-e which he ingested around 3:30pm. We decided to put up my nice teak lawn chairs in my backyard and appreciate the nice weather until he'd feel the first effects.


It took around an hour for the 2c-e to kick and then we went inside, sat down in the living room and turned on the TV. I divided the 4-ho-dpt into two equal lines and insufflated them 10min apart.


I started to feel effects almost immediately, my heart started to pound and I started sweating pretty bad. But like the last time the come-up wasn't too bad.


I started to get first visuals around 10min after I had insufflated the 2nd line, but things didn't get too intense until about 30min later, when we decided to put on some music (Ratatat) and I laid down in the middle of my living room on a big pillow.I turned my head to the side and just kept laying there in that position for the next 2-3hrs.


Those next 2-3hrs were one of the most amazing psychedelic experiences I've ever had. The visuals were beautiful and and extremely colorful.

The whole room was full with rainbow patterns and I saw colors I can't even describe. 


After around an hour everything got even more intense and I started to see lots of numbers and letters and eyes and lots of things I can't even describe.I noticed everything got cleared when I had one of my eyes closed and soon everything started to buzz / and pulling on me. Sorry I'm not a native english speaker so its hard to describe. But you guys probably know what I mean. The hallucinations started to get more and more intense and at the climax they pulled on me, this repeated itself every 2min probably. I wanted to let myself go with it but it was very hard and I only succeeded once. Immediately the 4-ho-dpt sucked me into extremely dreamy state, and with one eye open I had one of the the most clear and amazing, i guess you could call it vision, I've ever experienced.

The wooden floor turned into water and suddenly fishes started to jump in and out of the water ( floor ) and swim around. But those fishes weren't normal fishes, they were crayons in all different colors, leaving rainbow trails behind them.


It was amazing but only lasted for about 3min , and sadly I wasn't able let myself get pulled back into this state again. Nevertheless the visuals kept being awesome until around T+4hrs when my friend woke me up from my dreamy state down there on my living room floor and told me that we had to leave for a friends birthday party. 

The 8mi bike ride that then followed was pretty nice too but when we arrived at my friends party I was pretty much back at baseline.


Overall this was an amazing experience, but I think I didn't too enought yet. Next time I'll try around 32mg, which should be my sweet spot. I really can't wait but I probably won't be able to trip again in the next 2weeks since I have a pretty busy life.


By the way the mindfuck was a lot more intense than at around 20mg. I had some weird thoughts during this experience mainly over IKEA since there was an IKEA catalog at the other side of the living room, that I was starring at the whole time!

The jumping fish hallucination sounds delightful. I love the color and texture of wood grain, so I'm sure I'd find the way 4-ho-DPT riffs off its appearance beautiful. At low doses it has moved me to tears, and at high it has been part of profound visions. Coupled with your report of this elaborate open eye visual 4-ho-DPT is demonstrating itself to have incredible potential. 


Delsyd, your idea of tripping in Ikea is inspired.  I use to love playing in those fake houses in hardware stores as a kid (I've heard kids often forget the stuff is fake and shit in the display toilets!). I bet if I visited a store like it sufficiently altered it would be extremely nostalgic, not to mention having all those open rooms right next to each other would be surreal on its own. 


I'm thinking about dosing 20 - 30 mg 4-ho-DPT insuffated with DXM today.  I feel I need to confirm that the seizure-like effects and terrifying visions I had last time were due to my trying to knock myself out with GHB and being totally exhausted during a time when my subconscious mind (or whatever) was determined to keep me awake. I'll post back later or tomorrow if I do.


EDIT: I opted for LSD instead because I wanted a longer experience.  I definitely will do the aforementioned combo and post about it eventually, though.

psood0nym, I can't imagine a combination of 4-ho-dpt and DXM to be better than just a higher dose of 20-35mg 4-ho-dpt alone.


The headspace and visual are just so clear and clean. I think, at least for me, the DXM would kind of destroy this nice dreamy DPT state of mind plus give you a not so nice bodyload. I've never experienced any negative physical effects from the 4-ho-dpt.

The trip just feels so clear and nice, I don't think the DXM would make it better. It already feels perfect to me.


I'm really looking forward to pushing it up 32-35mg, which I believe is gonna be my sweet spot, but sadly I don't have time until maybe next weekend or the one after that.


After that I won't have any material left and I'm currently thinking whether to acquire some more of this, or 4-aco-dmt instead. I'm gonna have to give that some thinking, I'd love to get some of both but as a University student I don't have too much money to spend on this hobby.

^DXM has changed into something much different than it used to be for me.  Now it's manic and highly euphoric and the dissociated head space is more of a backdrop for the trip's proceedings. 


I ended up using 4-ho-DPT on top of LSD and DXM yesterday.  I started with 15 mg insufflated and kept using 15 mg redosings every couple hours or so four times throughout the night. 


Though light, 4-ho-DPT's character was tangible through the pharmacological dust-up of the DXM, LSD, (and ketamine). After every time I insufflated another line my eyes stretched wide and awake and my body seemed to shimmer like it was being coated in patterns of filigree rime as it rocketed up through the stratosphere and got its nipples licked by the cold flaming tongues of angels in the ethereal realms. 


My mouth kept contorting as though it needed to say certain words: "spangled," "shimmering," "star-burst busting." -- my body and the world around me seemed puffed out and on the edge of popping. I went on the roof of my apartment at sunset and watched the swallows dash the sky in lacy jags as they plucked insects from the tree tops. Their routine was so lush and bright and beautiful, and it was if the softened hues of limpid twilight were being wrung into the funnels of my eyes.  Each breath then was full and refreshing.

That sounds like you had an awesome time!


And ,well everybody experiences every drug different. It's nice that DXM affects you like that but for me DXM has been tied to a pretty bad bodyload every time and in higher plateaus (3rd or 4th) I always get really awful nausea and stomach pain. 

I get some euphoria too but for me it isn't worth the body load and I feel like the dissociation somehow destroys the nice clear headspace of other psychedelics.


I also don't like to combine psychedelics (excluding cannabis here, I usually smoke some during the come-up and come-down to ease the body-load, but I rarely smoke it on it's own) before I've experienced all their effects on their own. I first want to push up the dose a bit and experience 4-ho-dpt's full potential before I start combining it. 


Since I don't have enough material for more than one last 30-40mg trip and I'm not sure if I'm gonna acquire more of this material the next weeks , I probably won't be able to combine it with something in the next time. Even though I imagine it might be nice to combine it with some 4-ho-met that I still have lying around. I imagine the visuals to be quite amazing. But at the moment I'm rather tending to acquire some 4-aco-dmt instead of more 4-ho-dpt.

I have a moderate dose of 4-HO-DPT that I am going to try sometime really soon, nasally.  I'm pretty excited about it but also not really having very high expectations overall.  I'm just waiting for a nice day to spend outside that isn't my 2nd wedding anniversary. :D

Sounds interesting.


Perhaps the compound has lower bioavailability orally because the hydrophobic propyl substitutions dont let it pass digestive membranes so easily, so more is broken down before that. Is the oral comeup slower than with oral psilocin? Because that would compound this theory.

So far, I'm not sold.


But then again I think DPT is the most useful psychedelic. If it ain't broke, don't fix it, etc.


I think I have a trend in that I MUCH prefer the free phenols over their substitutes. DiPT, DPT, DMT, DET, MET and AMT are all far superior than any of their ring-substituted analogues IME.

^I have yet to try it at higher dosages.  I really want to do 50 mg IM before I level any final judgment, but I love it so far.  I guess it is pretty similar to DPT, though I'd say the closed I visuals are a little more sparkly, the iconography is more intricate and colorful, and the ego dissolution is a little less strong comparatively.  DPT is so unique, and so even though 4-ho is similar to it, unlike the other 4 substituted tryptamines it's nothing like psilocin, which still makes it pretty unique.  The sense that every thing is shrouded in soft velveteen flames is a little stronger, too. There most be something else novel about it as well, as I don't get the odd [experiential loops](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/showthread.php?t=443335) on it I've been getting consistently during DPT trips for over a year now either.

I've never tried this oral since the insufflated dose is pretty low.

I don't see any point in wasting material with trying this oral.


I actually prefer 4-HO-DPT over DPT. I've only tried DPT twice, around 2years ago, with 75mg and 125mg insufflated doses and both times I experienced severe nausea. With 4-HO-DPT I don't get any noticeably bodyload effects. 

The mindfuck isn't nearly as strong with the 4-HO version but for me the OEV's are a lot more colorful and clearer. 

The 4-HO-DPT's high just feel so clean without any noticeable body effects but an slightly elevated heart rate and the DPT-like dreamy state of mind/body, which isn't really negative.


But I think I still haven't experienced 4-HO-DPT's full potential, so I'll report back after I've had my 35mg experience.

^I started feeling the effects within about 2 minutes, and I went from relatively sober to full on tripping in the about 15 minutes it took to walk to where the fireworks were being held. There was no paranoia about being surrounded by hundreds of people, but the klonopin made have had a hand in that. The come up was very fast, but not in an overwhelming way. The visuals were very beautiful. The fireworks left impressions in my visual field that lasted a significant amount of time. The trails and such left by the fireworks would flash, sort of like lightning. There were a lot of morphing/twisting type of visuals once it got dark. Before that there was extreme color enhancement and a lot of molten surface effects, but nothing overwhelming. The sida seemed to give a nice energy boost to a somewhat sedate feeling substance.  Total time to baseline (not counting beer of course ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)) was about 5 and a half hours. Ate a big taco salad after a few beers. No nausea at any time throughout. Slept without issue  about 11 hours after dosing, but I probably could have far sooner, especially considering the beer and klonopin. All in all, a great time.

So I had some 4-HO-DPT today, a single dose as a gift from a friend.  I had a really nice evening.  The 4-HO-DPT was probably around 32mg snorted (36mg but it stuck to the bag quite a bit).  It slowly progressed into a very, very relaxed and lightweight pleasantness.  I felt more empathic and sociable.  I felt sparkly and alive, hanging out both outside and in.


At about 2 hours or so it hadn't progressed for a while and I found myself wanting.  So I decided to try adding 2C-B.  So I plugged 10mg, which would ordinarily be quite a light dose for me.  Before long, a wonderful state developed.  They combined really beautifully.  I found myself sitting outside with some freshly grilled food, my eyes closing involuntarily and fluttering from pleasure.  I felt like I was wrapped in a warm but refreshing blanket of luxuriousness... the body sensations were wonderful.  I felt almost a bit drunk, in the best way; I found myself a bit clumsy and I would occasionally slur.  I found myself wanting to snuggle, so I did.  I also found myself babbling on every so often, just because it felt good to talk.


Overall, I'd like to acquire some more of this so that I could use it in combination with 2C-B, and try it with others as well.  It seemed to really bring out the best in 2C-B, or maybe 2C-B brought out the best in it, even though by itself it was quite subtle (but nice).


Nice experience. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  I think I'll try to write a trip report.  Though I've got a lot of other writing to do.  But seeing as how it's such an obscure one, I really feel like I should.


I took the 4-HO-DPT at exactly 5:15pm... it's been almost 7 hours and I still feel really nice.  I hit the bong a few times throughout, which went very nicely.  I've had a bit of a bleary-eyed feeling for a while, like I could fall asleep and feel great doing it, but I'd rather stay up a bit. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I now think 35 mg insufflated is probably a little low for a plus three.  That's been my standard dose, but it's often been in concert with other psychedelics. I'll probably do 50 mg when I next take it alone.


I definitely agree with your description of it as "sparkly and alive," Xorkoth. I always get this body feeling like I've started a really great muscle stretch, and then right at the most achingly pleasurable point the feeling just freezes in place and my heart swells with warm light until it permeates my skin in firework crackles of resplendence.  


Again, in my experience it's closest to DPT but without the body vibration (at this level at least) and with less ego dissolution. It also seems like DPT's tendency to coat all facets of perception in plush velveteen textures is even more pronounced in 4-ho-DPT.


It slips into an LSD trips like a fresh naked body into a silk robe, and with aMT it's sheer beaming bliss.

Awesome. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


As a follow-up, I woke up today after about 6 hours of sleep and I feel fantastic.  The euphoria never went away... it feels like I've been realigned.  For now at least. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  I feel very relaxed yet energetic.

I must have a ridiculously low tolerance since 28mg already gave me a pretty good +++.


But I also never trip more than once every 1-2weeks, and I'm 1.80m and just 55kg.

Im 1.93 and about 100kg. I decided to do 50mg orally and after about 1 hour i still did not feel anything, since i got it free as a sample i thoght i got some really bad stuff. I decided to snort the  remaining 50mg and after about 30 minutes it really hit me like a BOMB!


Holy shit. I could barely stand up straight. I had i to lie down in bed and just chill for a bit. The colours were really really strong, and great euphoria. The sunlight was passing into my room and it looked exactly light rainbows on my ceiling and everything was so perfect. The trip lastet for around 5 hours.

A friend of mine is 1.85 and is about 58kg. He hadn't eaten the whole day. He tried 90mg. At the one hour point still not very much. 10 minutes later feeling the same. So he decided to smoke a bowl junglemix(junglemix=weed and hash together; in this case it was a dank indica and afghan border pollen). When he put the bong away it hit him very hard. He said he was feeling like raoul duke when he did adrenochrome. that was bit too much. the elk on his jägermeister flag was shaking his head like he want to come out of the flag. And he saw some kind of transparent relief on his couch pillow. the trip lasted 4 hours and the afterglow lasted about 2 - 3 hours. total of 6 -7 hours. Thats all I remember. And sorry for my bad english.


EDIT:

A few weeks ago he decided to smoke the rest(10-15mg) to see if its active. He just mixxed it into one weed/tobacco head. Smoked it and there was a light tryptamine buzz like from a low dose dmt he said.

Thanks for sharing guys.  I'm definitely interested in higher dosage experiences with this one. It's nice that the euphoria seems to stick around at 50 mg oral plus 50 mg insufflated.  I assume that means that, like at lower doses, at higher dosages too any ego dissolution effects are still proportionately small compared to the euphoric and aesthetic effects (IME, with DPT, at higher dosages the nature of the trip changes into feeling like I'm evaporated -- a la 5-MeO-DMT -- and the other effects get vaporized along with my sense of self)? 


Judging from my experience with it at lower doses, I feel like 4-ho-DPT could be "spiritually" very powerful for me, but in a significantly new way. So, JohnnyButterCookie and zepherox, did you experience -- or did your friend report -- any meaningful visions?  I'm also interested in ego effects that are distinct from ego dissolution, such as novel renderings of the self-concept, amplifications of self-respect (esp. those that are distinct from typical narcissistic feelings like coke or amphetamines often supply), new understandings of one's individual role in society, etc.

I should be obtaining a higher dose of 50mg shortly and I will certainly report again.  I really loved my 36mg experience, though I felt the added 2C-B at 2 hours was pretty crucial.  Hopefully this time more of the character of 4-HO-DPT comes out.  Though I will be hard-pressed to not add 2C-B after a while because the combo was so nice. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

50 mg insufflated is definitely where it's at for me.  I did that dose with 500 mg of DXM and ondansetron last night.  Things got a little discombobulated but it was more my fault for not planning enough of the night (music, films) ahead of time before starting. There were strong visuals, too.  4-ho-DPT is really fascinating.  It seemed like I was cognitively in the same orbit as a pretty strong ego dissolving DPT trip, but it didn't have near the "evaporated" feeling.  It felt like a spiritual inflatable castle, very deep in ways but with all the big drop offs having safety nets stretched over them. 


I love ondansetron. It allowed me to go upstairs and spin around in place a bunch of times before collapsing on my bed laughing like a spun-out little boy and getting sensations of being on a thrill ride (it feels fantastic to be 29 and enjoy something like this so much; better than as a child, even -- what a gift from the world these drugs are).  Without the anti-nausea med doing this would have probably made me sick. It was satisfying in a really strange way.  I was so dissociated from my body that having fun making myself dizzy felt like sweet juvenile revenge on my body for making me nauseated all those times before when I've gotten really dizzy and nauseated on drugs. 


"Hah hah body, I win!  I can have great thrills just by spinning in place and you can't ruin it for me! Wheeee!"


EDIT: Ondansetron won't prevent nausea from motion sickness.  What I mean is that I was able to get really dizzy on all these drugs with the same protection from nausea that I would have sober.

I must say I'm surprised by how little attention this substance has got. Maybe it is because it is not that widely available? Personally this one of my favourite psychedelics, combining so many wonderful effects; very uplifting but at the same time very introspective, beautiful OEV's and CEV's, reflexive and insightful yet with a very clear headspace. The visuals are quite unique and hard to describe; one interesting thing is that when you focus or move your eyes everything looks normal until you wait for maybe 10 seconds and brilliant visuals and colours appear everywhere. You can "normalize" yourself for a moment, just to be swept away as soon as you let go.


One of the unique visual aspects was that I constantly have bright white lights coming from behind; like bright lamps or strobes making me feel as I was on a stage in a theater. I felt completely lighted up. When I close my eyes I got completely swept away, nearing ego death (and this was on an insufflated 50 mg dose) with the music I listened to, my own thoughts and memories all floating into one. It was pure bliss. At no moment was there any fear or anxiety, but as it is a quite introspective substance, you might get stuck in thought loops.


Another interesting aspect are the visual hallucinations; music suddenly becomes much slower or faster. Often, one is able to control the pace of the music.


The onset is extremely rapid. Once insufflated, it took only a few minutes for the trip to really kick in. No time to sit down and prepare for the trip to begin. 


The only two negative things I have noticed are a quite markedly impared balance and an upset and "swelling" stomach which looks like a balloon. Walking around was a bit difficult, which is unusual for tryptamines. Somehow the motoric skills are impaired and moving arms and legs is a bit "crampy".


I have yet to try DPT, so a comparison is not possible, but as soon as I get my hands on DPT i will try to make a comparison between the two.


This is a very unique substance that touches you deeply. More so than any other 4-subbed tryptamines I've used.


Edit: Just to give an idea of the insightfullness I gained from this substance was memories from my childhood I couldn't had remember in a normal state. These memories brought back feelings of nostalgia and belonging, like a chain from my childhood to present. I was able to re-live memories and feelings, which was a very powerful, yet somwhow beautiful experience.

^ Great overview! Welcome to bluelight. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


I think it didn't gained so much popularity, because it is relatively novel to the RC market, its dosages are a bit high, but price is the same, so it is not very "cost-effective". 


I was going to ask you the question about similarity to other 4-substituted tryptamines, but I checked your (quite extensive) list of substances in "New member introductions", and 4-AcO-DMT and 4-HO-MET are untested by you.


I am interested in trying this chemical, but 4-AcO-DMT sucks for me, and 4-HO-MET isn't much better too, so I am unsure. Maybe this one is different.

Finally 4-ho-DPT is getting a little updated recognition. Thanks Cyanoide. I just recently got access to more of it, and I'm definitely planning some summer excursions.


Yeah, the dose, the low but slowly growing availability, the cost (which can actually be pretty cheap if you know where to look...), and the fact that insufflation seems to be the best way to go may be keeping it down. Apparently only the fumerate is stable as a powder, and that form isn't very water soluble so IMing is difficult.  My one attempt trying 4-AcO-DPT rectally seemed like a waste, but that was with just 16 mg if I recall correctly. That route is definitely worth further exploration. If it's close to the potency of insufflation at higher doses I'd be pretty satisfied (I hate drip). I just haven't tried it because I fear wasting such a treasure. Maybe I'll give it a shot over the next few months, I don't know. 


In any case, I've been using "RCs" for over a decade and this is one of my all-time favorites. It has many of the sensory and aesthetic effects of DPT without the torrential flood of ego dissolution (at least not nearly as extreme). It's very different than mescaline but it has the same "gentle but deep" character.

Ok, last week I took 18 mg AcO-DMT and just right now I'm landing from a 35 mg 4-HO-MET trip. Both were really nice.


I think I'll have something to say about both vs 4-HO-DPT when...probaby...soon. In this hour I'm still not ready ready for a post-trip answer ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I decided to try this chemical orally a couple days ago because I was not in the mood to snort a bunch of tryptamine. 


Ate 120mg 4-ho-DPT around 7:30 pm


after about an hour a slightly dazed feeling came over me, pleasant but not remarkable. Some color enhancement and vague CEV's. This persisted until around 9:30 - 10:00 pm when some amazing visual phenomena developed. I was sitting in my living room looking at the white wall when some kind of strands or cables of light became apparent behind the wall. They soon developed into an elaborate machine, with endless rows of tunnel like tubes decorated with ornate patterns extended far into the wall. Soon the objects seemed to manifest in the air in front of me and it became difficult to see objects in front of me. This was quite unique and beautiful, I've never had visuals quite like this before. Also my mind felt fairly intact considering I was tripping so hard I was having trouble seeing objects in front of me. This lasted about 90 minutes or so, and I was left with the feeling of my ego being vague or loosely defined. This ego dissolution was fairly strong but not as strong as DPT. My mind was left very active and I was unable to sleep until about 4 am. Overall this chemical was pleasant and very impressive visually, I think I may try combining it with either ketamine or methoxetamine at some point in the future. I have a feeling it would be one of those create your own universe inside yourself kind of combinations!

^ Uh, may I ask the same question again. How does 4-HO-DPT compare to 4-HO-MET and 4-AcO-DMT? 

I always keep my eye on this chem, but my non-impressive experiences with these two chems stops me from buying another possible worthless chemical(unless I tried more promising ones![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)). 


So, does 4-HO-DPT feels like other 4-substitued tryptamines? If yes, in what terms? I see that many people compare this compound to its parent - DPT, is these two really similar?

Hi, sorry for not answering sooner.


To summarize how 4-HO-DPT compares to 4-AcO-DMT and 4-HO-MET is: **deeper.** 4-Aco-DMT is more colourful although the visuals on 4-HO-DPT are less generic, taking more complex forms. 4-HO-MET was a bit disappointing, I had to take 35 mg to really trip. 4-HO-MET barely touched my inner feelings and I didn't feel especially creative on it. My main thoughts on 4-HO-MET were; is this it? Nothing more to give me? Nice visuals, yes, but really nothing mindbowing.


4-HO-DPT went in to my conscious and subconscious much, much deeper than 4-AcO-DMT and 4-HO-MET. 4-Aco-DMT, while I liked it very much, was extremely sedative. It felt almost "opiatish" at times. 4-HO-DPT gives me much more energy, altough it has the side effect of affecting my motoric skills negatively compared to the other two.


4-HO-DPT is also deeper in the sense that it gives an experience of ego death even at moderate doses. None of that was present with the other two (IIRC I took 25 mg 4-ACO-DMT, insufflated). Also, the visual hallucinations are unique to it, sounds become quite strange and music becomes slower and/or faster (sometimes both at the same time, imagine that...).


The body load is higher with 4-HO-DPT than the other two. My stomach swelled like a balloon eventhough I insufflated it. I felt a bit nauseous at times. The onset is extremely rapid with insufflation (definately my recommendation, you'll need lower doses to trip hard) and the afterglow is a few hours longer than with the other two. We're speaking minutes with insufflation, insufflated 4-AcO-DMT took 20 minutes before even the first effects were notices. 20 minutes after insufflating 4-HO-DPT you're already tripping big time.


But to summarize: 4-HO-DPT is deeper, more visual (not more colourful than 4-AcO-DMT (but the CEV's on 4-AcO-DMT kept repeating the same pattern, different sizes of "balls" morphing together while 4-HO-DPT creates boxes, triangles, pyramids etc which are much more beautiful and mindblowing), more "ego-killing" and less predictable. With less predictable I mean less generic, the trip moves in different phases and stages, with visuals reacting to what you think etc. 4-AcO-DMT and 4-HO-MET were quite much the same from the beginning to the end.


4-HO-DPT beats both 4-AcO-DMT and 4-HO-MET ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) 4-AcO-DMT is nice, I liked it, but it felt a bit too sedative for me, and 4-HO-MET just didn't get me "there". They both lack a certain cosmicness which 4-HO-DPT has. 4-HO-DPT is less down to earth and more away from earth. For self-exploration and deeper, meditative states, 4-HO-DPT is the way to go. For just plain fun, 4-HO-MET would suffice. 4-AcO-DMT is somewhere between.


If you have any futher questions allium, I'll gladly answer them. I promise to be more active now, has been so much stress at work lately.

I have exactly the same experiences with 4-HO-DPT. The walls seem to release astonishing amounts of light, which radiate through me until I myself start to radiate with light. I earlier made the comparison of strobe lights lighting me up, an experience actually only LSD has given me before.

It sounds like 4-Ho-DPT has more in common with DPT, than 4-Aco-DMT and 4-Ho-MET.

I thought 4-aco and 4-ho tryptamines generally couldn´t be vaporised?


Combining with a MAOI probably kicks ass.

It is good to hear that 4-HO-DPT is different from other 4-substituted tryptamines, because 4-AcO-DMT totally sucked for me, and 4-HO-MET was too generic. Anyhow, I think I'll try this 4-substituted tryptamine before others.

I haven't tried DPT though. That's the next RC I really would want to try. Has anyone tried both DPT and 4-HO-DPT? What are the differences? I think DPT is the one 4-HO-DPT should be compared to.


Btw allium, a bit off-topic but why did 4-AcO-DMT suck for you?

Can anyone comment on whether or not the freebase of this chemical is smokable? I understand 4-AcO-DMT (and psylocin) are unable to be smoked at all, but does that go with all 4-AcO/4-HO tryptamines in either freebase or other forms?

I've tried them both and I found 4-HO-DPT less transporting at roughly the same dosage level (50 mg DPT vs 60 mg 4-HO-DPT). I want to try it at higher dosages though, since it was indeed different from 4-AcO-DMT, 4-HO-DiPT and 4-AcO-MiPT.

I've tried DPT too now but still prefer 4-HO-DPT at higher doses (75-100 mg). 100 mg resulted in total ego death and disintegration of myself. I've found the bodyload on DPT to be more unpleasant too. 4-HO-DPT is still the best introspective tryptamine for me of all I tried.

Dunno how long tolerance with these tryptamines last, but today i'm giving 4-HO-DPT another try. Retrospectively 4-HO-DPT was much more of what i was looking for, in comparison with my last DPT experience, and i'm really thrilled how i'll think about it tomorrow ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


With 4-HO-DPT i just felt nice while having zero bodyload but a wonderful time. DPT gave me some terrible nausea (not that bad as with 5-MeO-MIPT, which was intense) and a somewhat unbalanced experience.

Well well, yesterday i dived deep into the 4-HO-DPT Realm (luckily without tolerance issues), and it seems that i was right regarding it's lower affinity for working on the serotonin receptors - or at least that's how it felt like. 


Just to clear things up, since I react a bit strange to mostly serotonergic compounds, i really don't like them that much because they're having their own, very indistinct character (like 6-APB or DPT for example) which unfortunately makes me feel much more stimulated and fierce than relaxed and euphoric. Perhaps, and that is what i realized in the last few months, this is because of a bad trip i had more than a decade ago, which was disastrous and still seems to linger within me.


With 4-HO-DPT, this feeling was almost non-existent compared to (for example) DPT. This doesn't mean it wasn't an euphoric experience, hell yes it was, but the joy didn't felt forced or generated, it felt totally natural. When I smiled, or laughed, it felt like it came deep from within my heart, it was, or felt like, true happiness, in fact.


What i really like about this substance, besides what i said above, is that it's really sedating in a very special way. It makes me feel totally comfortable and lazy (as with most psychedelics), while giving me almost zero bodyload. I'd say it's more of a mental sedation than a body sedation, like the one shrooms (or LSA) are giving you. What is really amazing is the clear-headed feeling it offers, no moments of uber-sobriety like that you can achieve with MXE, but even with sounds pitch-bending to a hilarious degree and my whole vision covered in tracers and sparkly waves of colors, i felt more or less in control of me and my thoughts - at least to some degree.


On the other Hand, and this is what I realized yesterday, this also means that there isn’t that much of an introspection compared to DPT/LSD/MXE/Shrooms etc., and it feels more like a recreational psychedelic with less depth…


BUT – and I don’t know if anyone has written it in here – THC added to 4-HO-DPT fits like the key to the lock and to me it’s just as matching as combining THC with MXE. 4-HO-DPT on it’s own is nice, but by adding THC it’s a whole other thing and by far one of the best substances i ever ingested. Here, it’s much easier to loose it - not as bad as with the more common stuff, but enough to probably scare the shit out of people who dose too reckless with this compound.


Conclusion: 4-HO-DPT is a very unique, worthwile substance and really entertaining, even though it lacks a bit of depth, especially in the head-department - but 4-HO-DPT + THC is just ridiculous - in a very positive way.

^ Irony?


Whatever, i'd like to add that the music appreciation with 4-HO-DPT is insane. On par, if not even better than with MXE. I found a new love ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

"Sharply emotional" - that's exactly how it is! Couldn't have said it better. I highly recommend Sigur Rós and/or Helios while on 4-HO/AcO-DPT. It synergizes very well!

I've had some great trips on 4-ho-dpt. The most memorable trip I had on this substance was on 100mg insufflated. I had intended to play Xbox because I'd just bought skyrim, but ended up lying on the couch listening to my favorite bluegrass albums. 4-ho-dpt was definitely relaxing and music enhancing. It didn't really remind me of dpt, which even at normal doses I find extraordinarily powerful and deeply introspective.

Oh wow, i'm so in love with 4-HO-DPT... Yesterday i tried some small dose intranasally (25mgs) mixed with some DPT (7mgs) and it was SO SO nice, words cannot really describe the pleasure to be exact. 


The funny thing about this combo is, that it felt like the DPT came on first, followed by it's 4-HO-Counterpart effects-wise, and they complemented very well with each other (surprise surprise). Got some DPT-tremors which subsided promptly, or to be precise, turned into EXTREME sexual stimulation far beyond anything i've ever experienced. I mean 4-HO-DiPT was erotic, but this was fuckin' porn! This lasted for the whole trip btw.


It's really hard to describe 4-HO-DPT and even with the addition of the DPT, it wasn't really deep mentally (compared to classic psychedelics) but moreso recreational. For me it seems like it's almost impossible to have a bad trip/a stressful time while on it. It's as if my brain is more or less deactivated, but this is just an illusion, in reality it's like all those complex thoughts are happening behind a curtain, not really within reach but obviously there. I had very complex and highly interesting thought processes going on, but they're so profound that it was almost impossible to really develop them further but just enjoy them while being totally immersed in happy bliss. And by bliss i'm not meaning like i'm feeling really euphoric but content and calm, truly happy and satisfied.


As said, it's hard to describe.


On another sidenote, if you think MXE goes well with music, you wouldn't believe what 4-HO-DPT does to it. Appreciation is an understatement, it's indescribable!


I heard GY!BE many many times on MXE, it was my music for MXE-trips, but on 4-HO-DPT it felt, heared and in the end, was like totally understanding it, it's message, it's emotions. I heard sounds as never heard before (and yes, they're there ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)) and i easily could separate it in all it's pieces, i.e. every single instrument that's being played!

Although I'm quite sensitive to most psychedelics, 26 mg of 4-HO-DPT would not do much for me. I need at least 50 mg before anything interesting happens and even then it seems shallower than plain DPT.

Heard 4-AcO-DPT lasts a bit longer. Think i should try this one too ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) 


100mgs sounds like a heroic dose, yes, but i think it could be totally possible, but dunno really if that's making this HO/AcO-substitute better at all? It's nice as it is and i haven't found my 45mgs dose much "stronger" than the last one (26mgs+7mgs DPT). And the ego loss/dissolution-thing is reaaaally mad fun.


But i'm unsure which ROA is more effective. I plugged some and found it very gentle, last time i sniffed it and it hit me really hard... but it could've been the DPT!?

I'm really surprised to hear so many good reports about 4-Aco/ho-DPT, i tried 4-Aco-DPT 2 times snorting it, first at around 50mg and second time at 100mg and i only got a mild ++ trip with very mild changes in visual activity, just brighter colors.

I really don't know how can you guys tolerate so well the extremely bad taste  you have in the throat when snorting it, it last hours on me.


Is 4-aco-DPT orally active at very high dosages?


I got bad results with DPT too, snorted 100mg and plugged 75mg, always mild ++ trip just like with 4-aco.

I'm going to try 500mg orally of DPT next time, i really can't tolerate that taste when snorted.


Do you know if at this dose is 4-Aco-DPT active orally?

You're right, the taste for both, 4-HO-DPT and DPT itself, is horrible! I'm not squeamish, but this is truly digusting stuff to snort.


As for the dose/ROA questions: afaik both of these substances should work orally, why not? But i don't think oral would hit you harder than plugging. I'm just not really sure if intranasally works better, like above said. Perhaps i'm trying orally too some day, who knows?


You should try some weed/hash with your 4-AcO/HO-DPT, it synergizes pretty well!

I tried 4-HO-DPT orally and it worked at (iirc) 75 mg. It wasn't super intense, but not bad either. Next time I'll probably go for 125 mg.

Well oral ROA  isn't for sure the 'cheapest' one with these compounds because i'll need much and they are expensive but i don't see any other way to take them, intranasally it's just too disgusting for me, that bad taste will ruin also my trip.

Neither the plugging way was good, i had to go often to the toilet, unpleasant feeling down there with production of fluids and so on. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I don't even consider IV route, i never did and i never will.


I have read that Shulgin took 500mg of DPT orally and he achieved an intense, visual and long lasting trip that is what i'm searching for, i never liked the smoking route too because the rush it's often too intense and fast and the whole experience is too short, that is why i'm not a fan of Salvia or 5-Meo-DMT.


So i thought that also for 4-ho/aco-DPT around that oral dose should be an intense trip, but i would like to hear if someone already tried it at high dosages, i just want to be sure before trying it and wasting so much of it or getting an overwhelming experience if it's much more potent than DPT.


And btw i can't add weed to that because i just hate thc effects, it always gave me bad paranoia, i tried few times adding weed or hashish to my trips with mushrooms or other tryptamines and it always ruined them, it is true that it enhances the effects but not in the right way for me, again i become paranoid and i feel really stupid like on weed.

can anyone refer me to any literature in regards to IV dosage? i have access to this compound and am decidedly swayed by reports of near intolerable taste via insufflation/oral ingestion.


have any members had success w/ (presumably lower) IV doses of this material? would it be safe to assume it is equally water-soluble, or similarly to other 4-HO/4-AcO-tryptamines (HCL is marginally soluble/free base is not)?? any insight would be greatly valued.

^ The taste isn't so bad - it's bitter, but not bitter enough that it should dissuade you from insufflation. Plus, it's really gentle on the sinuses, not harsh and caustic like its cousin DPT. Some people have tried the IV route, but failed because it apparently was difficult to dissolve in water. My recommendation: just sniff it.

@TxAxCx -

thanx for your input! it is much appreciated. that was also a legitimate concern of mine (if insufflation culminates in the HORRIBLE burning, shooting pain i've unfortunately experienced w/ other compounds of chemical relation).


is there a ROA/bioavailability chart for this one or no? if one was to consume their dose orally, how long might it take for onset to be expected?


apologies for all the inquiries; as you may well know, there is not a great deal of documented literatute existing on it. in any event, preparation prevents potential problems! ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

**Getting 4-ho-DPT fumerate into solution for IMing**


I finally acted on Sekio’s sage advice from months ago in a different thread to just try “boiling the hell out of it” to get 4-ho-DPT fumerate in solution for IMing. It mostly worked. I could have easily got the 35mg in 2 mL but I wanted to see how far intense boiling in 90 units (0.9 ML) of sterile water and 10 units of 5% acetic acid could take it.


I put it in a tall test tube so it could boil violently without leaping out, and set the tube’s screw cap on top so that pressure could escape while confining a significant portion of the vapor to the tube. I started using my microwave’s lowest defrost setting (the tube is plastic). The longest I let it go for was 30 seconds straight. This got most of it into solution but I set it to full power to see what would happen. I boiled a little too long and, after spinning around in my living room like a lunatic with the tube at arm’s length to get the droplets condensed on the side to pool at the bottom, dumping it into a vial, and drawing the solution into a syringe, I found I had boiled off 40 units leaving 60 units 4-ho-DPT solution. I didn’t go through the work of properly quantifying what was left because I was burning daylight and had a nature-gasmic adventure in recreational drug abuse to get under way but after drying it out with a hair dryer it looked like maybe 5 mg was left. I dumped some vodka on it and swallowed it for what it was worth. 


Judging by the subjective effects of the estimated 30 mg IM dose, IMing is an improvement in potency above insufflation of maybe 70 percent. Also, like DPT, the qualitative effects significantly benefit from the “hit me fast and all in one go” onset of IM administration over insufflation. I find 4-ho-DPT to have proportionally less ego dissolving and more sensuous, aesthetic-enhancing, and synaesthetic effects than DPT while maintaining some essential qualities (it’s closer to DPT than anything else, and I’ve tried over 15 5-HT psychedelics, including 4-ho-MPT, which is probably the next closest in my experience). I’ll probably use two or maybe even three 1 mL syringes next time to do a proper strong dose of 50 to 60 mg. I’m fairly confident from my 55 mg insufflated experience in the past that this dose IM’d will be enough to maximize 4-ho-DPT’s novel beneficial effects without venturing into ego death territory, which can get confusing and more difficult to integrate in a psychologically practical way (at this point of my psychedelic career I’m finding it more productive and prone to novel discovery to push experience within dissolved but not totally “de-patterned” ego boundaries).

Getting an amount of this finally! Been wanting to taste this one for a long time! Can anyone give a dose range? I've seen nothing on it really besides a few posts and TR's , but if someone could as an example say 4-HO-DPT is active from 15mgs-100mgs, something like that, maybe include ROA as well to avoid any confusion! Thanks!

You are not confused, 15-100mg insufflated is the range most have reported about. TheAppleCore noted strong effects at 26mg, but the majority seem to prefer 50mg plus (myself included). If you're like me 4-ho-DPT will operate at a more temperamental level than most psychedelics do. I find its subtleties in broad emotive scans rather than in focused heady plunges.

I might attempt to follow your route and make a solution to IM, though I know it will be difficult, i'll probably only hit for 50mgs. If I can correctly create the solution do you think it would go well with some MXE mixed in? From the talk i've read of it and my love for diss's and psyches combined it seems like a good choice since I also don't have a huge supply of it. I'll probably make the solution 50mgs 4-HO-DPT/75 or so mgs MXE, i'll probably insufflate anywhere from 25-50mgs of 4-HO-DPT beforehand to get a feel, then a few days later IM the solution. Sound feasible to you(i'd say i'm pretty thoroughly experienced with a large range of psyches and some diss's, if you don't know much about me that is...!), also do you think 50mgs would be good for at least a fairly strong ++ for the 4-HO-DPT's end? If not i'll probably add a bit more 4-HO-DPT as I may not want to make another solution for at least now as I don't have a load of it and won't be purchasing anymore for the moment.


Also that little description of how it effects you sounds throughly interesting and has only heightened my excitement to test 4-HO-DPT!

^Yeah, 50 mg insufflated will likely get you to at least a plus two.  As far as IMing you'll probably need at least 2 mL of light acid and water solution to get 50 mg to stay in solution at room temperature. Wait for the solution to cool after hard boiling because it may precipitate back out of solution and clog your syringe. MXE will probably be fine, especially with something like 4-ho-DPT. With headier psychedelics I find MXE's racy mania confusing and prefer ketamine by far. I personally wouldn't mix it with a dissociative, though. A lot of what 4-ho-DPT does for me happens on a sensuous level (enhanced textures and synesthesia), and so blocking signals from the body with a dissociative sort of undermines that aspect of it. It's by all means worth trying to see if you like it, though, assuming you're working with multiple doses.

I see a perfect response though given the user its not surprising, what sort of acid would you suggest and in what mixtures, 1ml of h2o mixed in with 1ml of the acid, or something like 1.5mls of h2o and .5mls of the acid. I'll probably follow your process and boil it to fuck, then drop like 75mgs of MXE into, micron it, then stab anyway incase the 4-HO-DPT wants to be a bitch and precipitate out back in the needle. It shouldn't be to hard, i'll just need to make sure to do it all fast and have everything needed ready to go at that point. I may not even IM the MXE as I may not bother purchasing anymore at the second but who knows. I don't have many doses but I have enough to play a bit, first i'll probably try 25mgs 4-HO-DPT/75mgs of MXE, so how they play with each other and all that, then move forward to 50mgs, unless i'm like TAC and get some crazed experience from a lower end dose, though as we all know that can happen at any dose at any time.

In my few attempts I've been using 1 part 5% acetic acid 9 parts water, but citric acid may be better. I'm not entirely certain what's really going on with the interaction of 4-ho-DPT fumerate and different acids so far as different combinations influence solubility, so it's up to experiment.


Time circumstances and lack of proper equipment prevented me from learning anything more specific unfortunately.

Unfortunately that may be the same for me friend, though I will experiment a bit, for example i'll be using three mls water or maybe a tiny bit more, if boiling, wouldn't some water and such be lost anyways?

What do you think would work best for this, container wise? I think I recall you using a plastic test tube on the lowest setting in the microwave, once or twice though i'm fairly stoned so...? Thanks for all the help?!? BTW!

Task completed. No microwave used, only a large spoon, probably six or so mls of water, 9 to 1 on acetic acid, and a nice Colibiri with a good strong jet flame. I would kept the solution pretty much at boiling then lightly added more heat with the jet flame to create the almost explosive(well yours probably did since you used the microwave!)super boil, would remove the flame almost immeaditately, give it another second or so to cool down, then did this process multiple times. It was agitating more than anything else just needing to hold the spoon in place for so long but oh well I eventually got 35mgs dissolved into about 1ml(thats what was left after boiling at least...). Probably give it a go to see where it takes me then formulate my next triage, something along the lines of 4-HO-DPT+6-APDB+2c-e+a bit of MXE in a solution.

^Nice. Yeah an adjustable flame and a proper boiling tube would be best. I started using the lowest defrost settings in the microwave, which may have worked if I had been more systematic about it, but it wasn't happening and I was running out of daylight for my hike so I ratcheted up the power and it nearly went kablooey. 


In any case it's good to know it's possible to get 35 mg in ~1mL with enough patience. That concentration makes me think we can probably get a proper strong IM dose in two standard 1 mL syringes, which isn't too unreasonable.


That combo sounds pretty good. One of my all time favorites is IM aMT and DPT, whose general character I imagine the 4-ho-DPT and 6-APDB portion of that combo would share.

I find insufflation of this compound far superior to IM. It has a "synth psilson type come up" which I don't hate but it always leaves me panicked and confused for the length of the come up. 10mgs insuffed versus 35mgs IM was out of this world superior! Never even thought about IM'ing it or plugging again because the BA's for each ROA besides orally seem the same for the most part! Least to me! Astounding substance though, worth every penny! Just make sure to "buy bulk" for the discount you'll receive as once your out, you'll wanna order more immediately the first chance you get after you run out of your "initial stash!".

^Huh, that's weird, especially for a drug that seems to have some degree of absorption issues plugging (though maybe it's enzyme related). I'd think such a compound would be even stronger than normal by IM injection relative to insufflated. Glad you had a good time in any case. I think I'll still try IM since I've already put some effort into it. I also picked up some propylene glycol. I may try plugging a 9:1 propylene glycol: DSMO solution with 4-ho-DPT to see if there's an improvement relative to water since I already picked up the mix to try with salvia.

Oh it was believe me, but IM'ing 35-40mgs at once ended up leaving me in a "panic" state during the come up because of its similarity to "mushroom" come up, IM it hits so hard and fast. I IM'd the 35mgs on its own when I had no known psychedelic tolerance, and I went to the bathroom immediately after IM'ing it because I had to pee like a MF'er and when I was done I checked my pupils in the mirror and there was like literally no Iris left because they were so dilated which is rare for me most times except with higher end doses of substances. For you stick to IM for sure as I know for psyches atleast thats your preferred ROA, same with me, may try it at a much lower dose next time, 35mgs was just way to much for as 4mgs nasally gets me tripping absolute balls just by itself! PM me if you want to talk more in depth about my experience via IM as it was nuts stuff!

^4 mg nasally makes you trip hard? That can't be right if you were able to walk to the bathroom on 35-40 mg IM. Is it about double nasal potency as expected?

I wrote that quickly, I thank God itself if it somehow exists and all that shit for that 35-40 IM'er. I hate mushrooms, I hate 4-AcO-DMT, the only thing i've taken that contained the core mushroom pharmacopia I ever liked, hell I tried it once and once only at 12mgs orally, and i'd scream it from the tallest mountains this world has to offer "I absolutely fucking love synthetically made psilocin!" just as much I would about LSD, mecaline, and or DMT. That was from one singular trip, one and only all orally, all at once in a single gelcap. I've munched the most potent caps known to man, and eaten the highest doses of 4-AcO-DMT, but hated either, and I realized why, no one had even shown a perfect middle ground, where the waves met perfectly, the bliss was absolute, and the turmoil absolutely deafening, yet standing outside as rain poured down my face all I could feel was pure euphoria for existing, not ATM, or anyone point in time, or for ever have been anything, except myself, that was there at that moment being showered with rain as tears excavated my cheeks like their own spiraling torrents, as if the sky where crying with me ATM for everything I was, for everything I ever had been, and for anything I ever will be. Silence like that is only known to certain people as is, whether they've experienced mountains or molehills, or ate 75,000 Ablert Hoffman handmade 750ug per hit blotter's does. Its almost as those moments of time existed for you and you alone, as if every other human was sucked into a pocket dimension for the time you were experiencing your "moment of silence". 


After reading this written by BloodShed I realized at once what had happened and why people like yourself only call 4-HO-DPT a "emotion changer/magnifier" thats simply all mushrooms are as well, their just packed together in such specialized amounts and so much, that it just all happens at once, which is were people like me come in, you can't out toke me on DMT, I mean maybe someone could because one of us would reach the "white out" space of DMT's high, but in a contest where we each had to inhale exact amounts of perfectly vaped DMT, in one hit, I wouldn't even be that scared to toss something like 150-250mg's out there as a starter. Thats not me dick sizing either, i've just smoked probably at least 25grams of DMT to myself in the space of a year............well you get it, i'm a bit of a nutter, no one has ever or will ever deny that one! No way in hell though would I go over 10mgs synth psilo orally, 35mgs 4-AcO-DMT and 3'gs average potency mushrooms.........., oh darn forget to post the quote oh well no time like the present, "With this one its less about the visuals and more about the visions. Less of an altered reality and more of a completely different reality.", you see thats why I fucking love DPT!!!!! Of course as well I love its four sub but let me put it into a better perspective for you, after I found the DPT/Ket/and or MXE IM'd or plugged at once!" thing, I easily could IM a 75IM MXE shot mixed in with anywhere from 50-250mgs of DPT in one shot. It actually got to the point that I hide the rest of my DPT because no one had bothered getting a synth done in a while and well I was beginning to run quite low obviously............ 


Anyways, I love DPT, I might not want to smoke it, but mainly becuase i've found smoked ROA's to be annoying and not at all worthwhile in simply tryps. Save those for IV/IM use when you can!![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


Oh and thats exactly what it was like when I pushed down the plunger, well I mean pulled out the needle/capped it/deposited of it!


Oh and lastly for future comparisons, walking is something I can do on anything, ask my friend who was promptly freaked the fuck out when I awoke from a knock out GHB dose(2.5-6.0 grams for me and I rarely pass out under 3.5)tried to get up, move around, and start to walk. He said he just grabbed me, laid me back down with something heavy ontop of me which he moved off from what he said like two seconds later as it was clear I somehow "snapped out of the g coma" came to and tried....IDK going to sit in my recliner? I'm also the sort of guy who needs serious doses of almost any normal alcohol or GABA like sedative to start tripping up, or falling over, or slurring my speech, thats when you know its time to get me into a bed, other things aren't go to so nicely! ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png) ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)


Reread my one and only IM ket report, you questioned how I was able to IM 175mgs of Ket with no tolerance, amongst a slew of other things, yet be able to pull up my pants, walk to the bathroom/put everything away, and take a piss/flushing before pretty much literally falling into my recliner and K'holing, lol I pretty much stumbled into/pulled myself into a seated postion, jacked up the footrest, and bam KKKKKKland!!!!! 


Oh and 4mg weighed on a sub mg, put onto my "special" snorting tray and snorted through a straw, tapped, clenched the nostril to make sure none got past the goodie zone, then IM'ing MET HCl wouldn't make you trip hard.....?!?!?!?!? ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png) Metlers have nice windshields even if their older in the years........![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png) 4-subs are weird for me BTW, some I need super high end doses to get anything, other times with like say 4-HO-MET, 10mgs can give me a full on +++ without trying........

Please be carefull people, it turns out **this is not at all as simple as "an equivalent oral dose is 2 to 3 times an insufflated dose"**.


50 mg insufflated gave a nice strong and solid buzz for 2 to 3 hours.

50 mg orally was very very very mild or placebo (never more than a +1 achieved).


But 158 mg **orally** (expected to be slightly stronger than 50 mg insufflated) resulted in a completely unexpected and total ego-loss, full-blown DMT hyperspace in CEVs, and overwhelming OEVs making orientation difficult. It was definitely stronger than 750 µg of LSD squeezed into 4 to 5 hours. I was absolutely not in the right setting at the time and this could have turned horribly wrong. Just be aware of it.

I strongly suspected from the character of my first 16 mg insufflated trip with 4-ho-DPT that it possessed the potential to do what you experienced.  It was a small dose, but I sensed I was getting my feet wet at the edge of an abyss.  Others have said otherwise, but I clearly feel the annihilating light of DPT shining through 4-ho. From what I've read in this thread 70 mg of 4-ho-DPT taken orally will result in a light but definitely active experience. You more than doubled that dose, of a drug whose parent compound is known to change character at higher doses and vaporize egos, and you more than tripled your own first oral dose of it. You were skipping steps and you tripped in an area that made you nervous. I'm glad you recovered with just a few bruises to your psyche but I'm not surprised it happened. If you insufflated 80mg (aack!), or about half your big oral dose, I think you might experience similar. I’m thinking insufflated is still roughly double the potency of oral and your surroundings and drug’s natural character took you by surprise.  I have a feeling that phase shift at higher doses is just 4-ho taking after its daddy.  


Thanks for figuring out what a strong oral dose is though.

This is simply wonderful material! 

60mg of 4-aco-dmt (oral) + 100mg 4-ho-dpt (insuffilated) produced some of the coolest closed eye visuals I have ever experienced... Very "TRON" esque grids of moving boxes of light all moving in extremely structured order. I was blown away every time I shut my eyes!

As a side note, this was at a multi-day festival and tolorence played a big roll which is why the dosage was so high.

Could you be more specific on what you took on the previous days? Without tolerance, this would be an absolutely insane dose.

Perhaps it is time for me to detail a little more.


Somewhere in Tihkal, Sasha hypothesizes a rule of thumb regarding the number of amine carbons / activity ratio. He believes that below 2 (e.g. DMT), MAOs hinder oral activity, and above 6, activity also decreases via another mechanism (probably simply because the molecule gets too long). The sweet spot is in between.


Almost 2 years ago, I decided to start researching this 6-carbon limit case, in particular for 4-substituted indolols and acetate ester thereof.

As for many of you, my research is highly censored by my Legislator, and although I am aware of the fact that civil disobedience can be (and has been) a powerful tool for human rights in general and scientific progress in particular, I have made the choice to go by the rules, no matter how nonsensical. This, market availability, and personal intuition led me to assay 4-AcO-DALT and 4-HO-DPT multiple times.


I had been curious about the allyl functional group in psychedelics ever since a ++++ experience on 5-MeO-DALT in 2010 (legal at the time). Yes, a +4 on 5-MeO-DALT, but a higher dose, I do not remember the exact dosage and tolerance was involved. Near the end of the [new online entry on 5-MeO-DALT](http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/5meo_dalt/5meo_dalt_info1.shtml), Sasha makes the following interesting remark:


*Another direction possible for modifying the structure would be to relocate the oxygen in indole ring over to the 4- position. 4-Methoxytryptamine is commercially available, and it should be directly substitutable for the 5-methoxytryptamine used in this synthetic process giving rise to 4-MeO-DALT. Yet further out, what about starting the 4-benzyloxytryptamine and walking the same path? The product could be easily stripped of the benzyl ether by the usual catalytic hydrogenation, giving rise to the diallyl analogue of psilocin, 4-HO-DALT. I would wager a ten dollar bet that the acetate ester of this material, 4-AcO-DALT would be in the brain within minutes of swallowing the pill.*


Finally, long before AL-LAD became available on the market, I had been fascinated with this allyl-substituted lysergamide, compound #1 in Tihkal. This was the intuitive rationale behind my wish to try 4-AcO-DALT. As for 4-HO-DPT, I had always wanted to try an indol-4-ol (not ester, i.e. psilocin analog), and knew DPT by reputation (I have never tried it though, and am unlikely to do so in the foreseeable future).


It took some time to find a proper 4-AcO-DALT dosage. Eventually, somewhere in between 80 and 90 mg was established to be a strong-ish dose, and a nice, albeit disappointing buzz a day after 1 mg of 25i-NBOME (legal at the time, and wrongly assumed to be safer than it really is). This assay involved 3 subjects. More disappointing assays were done within 3 weeks in the 50 to 70 mg range, occasionally boosted by some 5-MeO-MiPT (legal at the time, and possibly degraded) and 500 µg 25i. Recall that 25i's tolerance can last 3 weeks. 4-AcO-DALT was never assayed intra-nasally.


After careful reading of the online underground research (mostly erowid and BL) regarding 4-AcO-DALT, 4-AcO-DPT, and 4-HO-DPT, I hypothesized that a double-blind test between these would make them completely indifferentiable in terms of effects. I may still think that.


50 mg of 4-HO-DPT were orally bioassayed and gave me a +1, with nice relaxation, perhaps some auditory stimulation.


A week later, the same dose was insufflated and caused a solid psychedelic buzz of no more than three hours.


A week later, the same dose orally was assayed, along with some Rhodiola rosea to test whether this confirmed in vitro MAOI was worth anything in vivo. This resulted in **no effect whatsoever** (sorry arctic root!).


Finally a week later, I prepared a 100 mg cap, planning to take it, and noticed there was only 58 mg left in the bag. Thinking about all this previous research, I decided to take all of it, assuming I was in for a short ride akin to 2 or 3 tabs of acid. The result was this ridiculously strong trip, and the setting not being right, it was a bad trip, which left me, to use psood0nym's words "with a few bruises to my psyche".


After this, I have put my research on 6-carbon amine tryptamines on ice, and also because I got excited about the availability of the novel lysergamides (AL-LAD in particular, which has always interested me, as mentioned above). I believe I have briefly commented on them in their respective B&D threads. Perhaps I will elaborate on them when I have time. I also have very positive things to say on micro-dosing, and if I ever find the courage to take 4-HO-DPT again, it may be in a micro-dosing range (20 mg?).

It was a multi day festival, Wednesday was miprocin, Thursday was lsd, Friday was ethocin+ E,

Saturday was 4-aco dmt+ 4-ho dpt and by that point even at the dose I took I had nothing but seriously impressive closed eye visuals, Sunday Psychadelics had no effect whatsoever.

This a strong lesson learned and we will not be so irresponsible with Psychadelics. 

Next year maximum tripping for no more than 2 or three nights max. 

Tolorance is a bitch!

The best way to do such a thing would probably be by doing different families of psychedelics each night.

I had considered this but I thought for safety's sake that sticking mostly to Tryptamines would be the smarter choice. Ecstacy was prevelant and I was weary about mixing Phenethylamines. 

But I agree, as far as effect goes better to probably mix it up.

My friends tend not to be as responsible as I am and so I'd rather have a night that didn't live up to expectations  than have someone need medical care. Every time.

I got to sample this material again (the last of what I had). I ended up taking 40mg aMT orally and about 3 hours later I insufflated a bit over 300mg 4-ho-dpt over the course of about an hour.   I have had the opportunity to sample 4-ho-dpt now 3 times and honestly this is probably my very very favourite research chem. the experience I had last night was one of the very greatest psychedelic experiences of my life!

4-ho-dpt for me gives rediculously unique visuals all 3 times I've tried it which consist of pockets of translucent honeycombs that are stretched out and have  a 3D depth to them which change configuration as I moved my head to left or right. The most stunning thing about the visuals however was that the translucent green honeycomb display  constantly had backwards texts and barcodes constantly scrolling across it. This lasted for several hours and at several times I had to stand up and focus on the characters which were so goddamn vividly realistic.  Much more detailed than the alien/Egyptian hyrogliphs I see on mushrooms. 

The most impressive aspect of the trip though was the way in which 4-ho-dpt changes the perception of sound. I kept thinking that I was hearing a fly buzzing around my head but every time I turned my head I realized that it's just a ceiling fan. Somehow, 4-ho-dpt radically changes how you perceive sound. The best way I can describe is like hearing in 3D or hearing multi dimensionally. Most things just sound different (not voices) but if you listen to the same thing and turn your head to different angles the sound changes really dramatically! So naturally we put some music on and my god!! Wow!!

This stuff also has a very very powerful spiritual depth to it and I spent a big part of the trip reflecting and gaining insight to my life. 

This was truly in the top 3 best experiences of my life. I wish my Vendor would heed my emails and restock a ton of this stuff. Very little compares with just how honestly awesome this material is. Without a doubt if stuck on a deserted island with only a lifetime apply of 1 chemical this would satisfy EVERYTHING I look for in a psychedelic. Just truly magnificent stuff.  In not even doing it justice with these words.

I ended up taking 40mg aMT orally and about 3 hours later I insufflated a bit over 300mg 4-ho-dpt over the course of about an hour.   I have had the opportunity to sample 4-ho-dpt now 3 times and honestly this is probably my very very favourite research chem.

That was responsible? I hate to see what your definition of irresponsibility is. First time with aMT and you blow through more 4-HO-DPT than most would need for 3 ridiculously powerful trips. You're lucky that it turned out well. aMT doesn't mix with a lot of substances.


Anyway, after reading this whole thread, I think I found something that I'm going to have to get my hands on. I didn't particularly enjoy DPT's bodyload and this sounds like something that would be right up my alley. I have been curious about this one for years and always had high hopes for it. It looks like I'll be ending my 2 year abstinence some time early next year. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I don't feel in any way that I acted irresponsibly. The aMT I took had very little effect after nearly 4 hours and this was my 3rd experiment with 4-ho-dpt at varying dosages. I had a very good feel of what 150mg does when ingested all at once and the 300 I insufflated over the course of an hour was in no way a negative experience. There were no signs of any kind of toxicity and would feel very comfortable pushing both the aMT and 4-ho-dpt to higher dosages. The aMT I have is probably severely degraded based on its apperance and effects.  It's not like I was mixing Phenethylamines with aMT.  I'm not sure if you have much experience with 4-ho-dpt but 100mg insufflated produced pretty mild effects. Maybe a +1. I seriously don't think 300 is outrageous for this chemical for people experienced with psychedelics even with aMT.

Sounds like both of your products are seriously degraded/cut or you have a high tryptamine tolerance. Possibly both. 40mg of aMT is pretty decent for most to get a decent mild plateau and I read this whole thread and the average insufflated dose of 4-HO-DPT seems to be around 50mg for an intense experience with a 158mg oral experience being noted as extremely intense.

Don't know what to tell ya... I suspected the aMT to be degraded based on its apperance. The 4-HO-DPT was from my usual vendor who's products have always been of extremely high quality. I don't believe I have a terrible tryptamine tolorance. My usual dosage for most 4 subbed tryps is 30-40mg. But I'm also quite comfortable taking a heavy ammount of psychedelics if I wish. Once you've worked your way up to navigating through 6 hits of strong LSD, 300mg of 4-HO-DPT is nothing. I'm certainly much more careful with Phenethylamines but most tryptamine tend to be a lot safer. I honestly feel that probably the max dose for myself for 4-HO-DPT would 400-500mg I know that sounds crazy but this stuff seems so non toxic and benign. I would seriously recommend taking each 100 mg (50mg in each nostril) every 20-30 mins. I would not take more than 200 mg in a single dose.   On aMT and 300mg 4-HO-DPT I never head any serious heart rate increase or sweating or headache or even any stomach discomfort. This stuff just seems like a wise teacher with some rough edges in a similar manner that LSD does (it'll make you reflect on what you may or may not want to face). 

It also has some of the coolest and most unique visuals and auditory effects I've ever experienced. It's a shame it seemingly requires so much material for a full on trip. This stuff wasn't cheap.

I don't believe tolorance was an issue. I had a trial with 30 mg 4-AcO-MET 3 weeks earlier and I usually like to keep a my trials at least 2 weeks apart and usually don't like to drop more than once a month.

You are sadly mistaken if you think that tryptamines are inherently safer than phenethylamines. I fell under the same conclusion and it just isn't the case. aMT, 5-MeO-DiPT, 5-MeO-aMT, 5-MeO-MiPT, and DPT at high doses can all make most phenethylamines look like nothing in terms of toxicity. Phenethylamines are known more for cardiac stimulation but tryptamines do it too - those ones I listed specifically. The methoxys are the worst for dose/response curve and both aMT and (EDIT) DPT have some pretty nasty bodyload attached to them.


Anyway, be careful - it sounds like you're getting poor product in those two cases, remember that it can vary batch to batch quite drastically because there is little QA in these products. I have read the other reports on this thread and I know what kind of experience all of those cats have and if they say that 50mg insufflated was more than enough, I definitely believe them. You might get yourself into a rather uncomfortable place if you procure more and it happens to be stronger.


Also you said 300mg over the course of an hour... There is a possibility that you had a tolerance as soon as it kicked in. That's actually fairly common and I've found it to be very true with other 4-subs.

Yeah 4-HO-DPT is a strong one that's for sure, i've used many a psyche and it absolutely rocked me to the core at 45 IM. It was some pretty pure insanity for around an hour or so until it began to calm into the beautiful experience that is 4-HO-DPT. Only wish it was more common and I had more on hand. Really such a beauty!

How would you compare it with DPT? I wasn't fond of the DPT bodyload. It was heavy and stimulating at the same time. A very confused state of existence.

Edit: Oh...yeah thats just how DPT is/can be at times, its one of the weirder simple tryps, not like MET/DMT/etc at all really I loved it though! You know me though I pretty much loved/love them all though!![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

I'm not one to complain about BL's unless their too....overstimulating and such as I was an addy/ritialin child since near birth and since then, well and probably before then hated all stimulants. The only "stiminng" psyche I traveled around the block with more than once was 2c-I, never even bothered with DOI as such but loveddddd DOC. Insufflated 4-HO-DPT is much calmer, maybe because it doesn't have such a grand BA that ROA or something but it just has a different flavor, if you need help getting it into solution for say, plugging or IM/IV, Psood's the man to talk to...well as per usual!![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png) As I find his knowledge far exceeds my own/the majority of users on this site as he seems to be a creative genius TBPH!

Well you and I both tend to have similar likes and dislikes when it comes to substances unless I've absolutely overdone something and fallen off my rocker ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


And yes... I don't know why I subjected myself to 2C-I multiple times. It should have been a clue when I got so stimulated that I was on a marathon power walk for the first 2 hours of a 20mg trip and still couldn't sit still.


Anyway, I would probably insufflate it. I kind of got used to that ROA when I was binging on mephedrone ![:X](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/mad.gif)


It won't be for awhile. Tapering off my Valium comes first, then I need money, which means I need to have a job, and then I need to find it. I figure it will make itself known if its meant to be.

I was thinking, 4-HO-DPT isn't a very sexy name, and as we do have psilocin and psilacetin, we have metocin and metacetin, miprocin and mipracetin etc etc


Couldn't this one be called diprocin? and the acetate dipracetin.

I think 4-HO-DET is cometimes called "Ethocin" and 4-HO-DiPT "Iprocin" so logically, 4-HO-DPT would be "Procin"? Apparently it's already a commercial name for at least one pharmaceutical drug. "Propocin" ? Sounds a bit like "proposing"... Of course that would make 4-HO-DMT "Methocin" which could be a little confusing since we have 4-HO-MET = Metocin, but we usually call it "psilocin" so no biggie...


(Replace suffixe -ocin with -acetin for acetates)

4-HO-DMT: Psilocin

4-HO-MET: Metocin

4-HO-MPT: ?

4-HO-MiPT: Miprocin

4-HO-DET: Ethocin

4-HO-EPT: ?

4-HO-EiPT: ?

4-HO-DPT: Propocin?

4-HO-PiPT: ?

4-HO-DiPT: Iprocin


And then there are all combinations with allyl groups. So far, to my knowledge, the only tryptamines commercially available with allyl groups on the amine are n,n-DALT, 5-MeO-DALT and 4-AcO-DALT (Alacetin?).


I don't know if the question marks have ever been made. I know 5-MeO-EiPT is commercially available at the moment, so maybe 4-HO-EiPT is as well. I think Tihkal mentions that when you start going into butyl groups, you get oily things, difficult to crystalise.

Alright a user SloMo, brought up an interesting question that might be one to ponder.... How do you guys(psood/Eth/etc.)think this one would do with addition of an MAOI beforehand like with extracted DMT/DPT/etc.? Do you think if an MAOI was taken beforehand, then 4-HO-DPT was simply insufflated which everyone knows is the easiest ROA in technical terms....I know it can't really be "answered" as such, but any worries on that? Obviously as always titrate upwards with the MAOI/insuffing the 4-HO-DPT but it sounds like a viable option to me if say, someone was only planning on ingesting 4-HO-DPT or things that are absolutely known to be MAOI complacent? Hard to word really, but I figure Psood might know what i'm getting at. I'm simply unsure if it's the sort of thing that's simply to risky or might actually be worth a shot since from what I remember people like most MAOI's(reversibles..)and tryps for potentation like 4-AcO/HO-DMT/Mushrooms/DMT/etc.

I'm actually more interested with taking orally with an MAOI , although I'm very curious to hear about it if anyone decides to try nasally with MAOI. Is there any consensus if it is active orally at any dose? I tried 30mg orally the first time I tried it just to see if anything would happen and I don't usually snort anything ever but nothing happened after an hour so I snorted 100 mg split into 2 piles 20 mins apart. 

I would much rather take it orally even with an MAOI than snort even though it was really not bad at all to put up my nose especially compared to DPT which was caustic as hell to me the one time I tried it.

I'm talking anything really, I mean ROA wise, its just in you read this thread there's a telling point. It's seems to either be that you are blown out of the water at low end levels through nearly all ROA's as I was, rare for me as well, or you just don't get much from it, I can't take credit for the idea as Slomo brought it up to me via PM but either way I had to ask ASAP as it was a pretty damn nifty idea in my mind, atleast!

It's orally active anyway, IIRC I had 75 mg a year ago and after 1,5 hours another 40 mg. It wasn't overwhelming, but it was tripping.

Like I said, I took 50 mg orally once and it was very mild. I did it again with some Rhodiola rosea, which was proved to be a strong MAOI **(in vitro!!!)** and that resulted in NO EFFECTS whatsoever.

Then 3 times that dose orally without supplement took me by surprise and was really overwhelming.

This is what i'm talking about you guys! If you look back many people including Nuke and such have stated similar things. We know its orally active, we know its rectally active(I think psood plugged some at least....), we definitely know its nasally active, and we know its active via IV/IM, what we don't know though, is how an MAOI would effect the dosing range or ROA's. For all we know, a good dose of a reversible MAOI might enable people to be able to take slightly smaller doses of this somewhat rare compound! I know people have used DPT+MAOI's like DMT+an MAOI but haven't heard of anyone venturing into it with this.

I'm pretty sure that if you felt nothing, that would mean the dose of the MAOI wasn't high enough either.  Because, with a pretty decent dose of an MAOI it should cause some bit of a high.

Perhaps the dose response curve doesn't start until a certain point and then it might get steeper than other 4 subs?

I don't know about oral with an MAOI, but I'd start with at least my preferred insufflated dose if I were to try it. I don't think it's any riskier than taking MAOIs with other tryptamines. I've taken 3g of ground harmala seeds before IM injecting DPT before just to see what would happen and I didn't notice really any difference at all, if that's any indication. For whatever reason, insufflation is more potent than plugging with 4-ho-DPT. Looking at a recent thread about why ketamine isn't very good plugged in the Neuroscience and Pharmacology Discussion forum, it appears that raising the pH of a ketamine/water solution with an equivalent amount of sodium bicarbonate helps improve absorption rectally such that plugging becomes comparable to insufflation in terms of potency. Perhaps futzing with pH would do the same for 4-ho-DPT, I don't know. 


Can anybody comment on whether  citric acid is more effective at keeping 4-ho/AcO-DPT in solution than acetic acid at a comparable concentration and pH? Are there any other recommendations for a more effective easily accessible acid to use for this that can be intramuscularly injected?

Once i'm able to grab this one again I certainly would! TBH though i'm a bit weary as that 45mg dose IM really rocked me, and for instance, I really enjoyed IM'ing say 60mgs of MXE and 45mgs DPT, simultaneously. This one was a bit of a weird beast though, which just makes me want it all the more! Interesting though about the MAOI, I was hoping it might make oral dosing easier, as nasal is easy enough and for me really didn't require much material either. This one was such a good add on, it seemed to really flow with other tryps or phens!

It slowly progressed into a very, very relaxed and lightweight pleasantness.  I felt more empathic and sociable.  I felt sparkly and alive, hanging out both outside and in.

I found myself sitting outside with some freshly grilled food, my eyes closing involuntarily and fluttering from pleasure.  I felt like I was wrapped in a warm but refreshing blanket of luxuriousness... the body sensations were wonderful.  I felt almost a bit drunk, in the best way; I found myself a bit clumsy and I would occasionally slur.  I found myself wanting to snuggle, so I did.  I also found myself babbling on every so often, just because it felt good to talk.

It too bad man, I've only had the fortune of experiencing this truly magnificent tryptamine 3 times! My last trial with this one was the most magical experience I've ever had on any tryptamine ever. Completely unique open eye visuals that was comprised of a giger's alien esque (though translucent green in colour) actually it was sort of like a giger's alien sort of honeycomb structure that covered my entire field of vision for several hours it was almost like a true hallucination rather than the usual open eye visuals. If I moved my head to right to left, the configuration of the honeycomb structure moved as if on a axis point. It was the most vividly realistic visual I've ever experienced. If I focused on the honey comb structure I could see with crystal clarity that thousands of backward scrolling alien characters and barcodes were scrolling across this green translucent "honeycomb" matrix. My girlfriend spent a large portion of the night laughing at me as I kept standing up and reaching out to try to touch it because it just looked so fucking real!!

I will never forget that trip! It has has such a profound effect on me. I've actually been toying with the idea of getting a custom synth of 4-ho-dpt done but it'd be quite the initial investment and I'd never go through 500g. Though I bet I'd see myself going through half that in my lifetime as I'd just be handing it out at every festival. Lol!

Did you post a report of this on Erowid?  If so I think I've read it. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  If not, someone else experienced a really similar visual distortion from this.

How did I just delete that long post ....

Oh well,

I did post it about this trip earlier in this thread. Long and short of what I somehow just deleted. 4-ho-dpt is is so profoundly psychedelic it's just capable of a certain profoundness like 4-aco-dmt while still maintaining the clarity of something like 4-aco-met.  

I might be getting more of this as it looks like an on old reliable domestic supplier of mine is opening up shop again and they might be carying it. I will be sure to titrate up from the beginning again since I don't know if the last batch I got is weak or not.  But really no research chem has impressed me this much except for maybe MXE. It's that good it's just dose dependend. At the right dose this stuff has the magic of quality LSD. Other 4 subbed trypts just get stronger in intensity but with 4-HO-DPT it seems like there is a threshold at around 50mg insufflated were it becomes magic. ( and my batch may have been weak so you'll all need to star much lower) 

But yeah, very unique open and closed eye visuals and probably the most spiritually beautiful headspace I've ever felt except maybeon MXE ( wow what a combo that would be!!!)

I will be sure to report back when/if I can get more of this stuff.

Sounds like it has loads of potential. Hopefully by the time I get around to 4-HO-MET the price on this will have come down... one can hope.

I've had 4-AcO-DPT in cold storage for years, but I haven't tried it yet because I'm uncertain about which ROA and dosage range to use -- I want to avoid accidental waste of this expensive material. I've also read many conflicting reports on this substance and the HO variant -- some praise them, some complain that they're virtually inactive, and some say that one is active while the other one isn't.


What's the deal? Are these compounds essentially the same regarding ROA and dose, or not? I believe that unlike other 4-sub tryptamines, both are best insufflated (for greater bio-availability). Is that correct? If so, what are medium-high to high (but not heavy) doses? Lastly, what is the typical duration of such an experience? I would expect it to be significantly shorter than that of other 4-subs taken orally, but I'm not sure.

Thanks for your input. Would such an insufflated dose be roughly comparable in power to a 25mg oral dose of 4-AcO/HO-MiPT? Less? More? Knowing that would give me an idea of what to expect.

4-HO/AcO-DPT isn't compareable in any way with all other 4-subbed Tryptamines. It's very gentle, which means that ones Headspace remains mostly unchanged/clear and it's kinda Dissociative while the other Compounds are more compareable to Shrooms which's making this one really exciting/interesting as it's effects are completely different to Compounds like 4-HO-MiPT, for example. They are all very interesting and enjoyable and each one is unique!

Thanks for the input. I've tested the following multiple times: 4-AcO-DET, 4-AcO-DiPT, 4-AcO-DMT, 4-AcO-MiPT, 4-HO-DiPT, 4-HO-MET and 4-HO-MiPT. All certainly have their unique flavor; even the AcO and HO variants of the same base do. I've also tried 4-AcO-DALT, but only once. Results were negligible, but its character was also distinct.


I'll try 4-AcO-DPT via insufflation at some point in the near future. The things we have to do for science... ![:p](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)


What duration can I expect from a 25mg trial?


4-MeO-MiPT for later...


Incidentally, the mixture of 4-AcO-DiPT and 4-AcO-MiPT is excellent. Ditto re. 4-HO-DiPT and 4-HO-MiPT. Both combinations yield orgiastic visuals and can easily turn a block of ice into a sexual giant. On the downside, the transition from baseline to full intoxication can be pretty darn aggressive, while the stimulation tends to be borderline uncomfortable. Anyhow, simultaneous oral ingestion of 18mg of 4-AcO-DiPT and 12mg of 4-AcO-MiPT (a little less with the HO variants) produces an experience that rivals 35mg of either substance taken alone.


Now back to our scheduled program...

This one's pretty rare, there was a vendor in Europe that had it, but they shutdown, but thankfully a local vendor is willing to order it for me.


I'm pretty interested in this one, as I very much enjoyed DPT by itself, what a wonderful substance, especially when turned to freebase and smoked, I never had DMT but I guess I came as close as I could with it. I've never seen 4-aco-dpt either, but experience seems to indicate that hydroxy 4 substituted tryptamines are more desirable than their acetoxy cousins.


How close is it to 4-ho-mipt or 4-aco-dmt ? These are the only 4-substituted tryps i've had, 4-ho-mipt being the most fun one, 4-aco-dmt was very pleasant on the first try, the 3 other times have gotten worse and worse and got filled with feelings of self-judgementalism(not a word i know), harsh feelings of unspecified guilt in the the second part of the trip and a massive production of mucus in my throat that was ridiculous, maybe the powder itself had been handled by someone who had an infection, because for a whole year i've been plagued with chronic sinusitis since then, well it's gone now, it had turned into a sinusitis-bronchitis with fever and all that, 14 days of Cefzil, a lot of Symbicort inhaler shots and a week of prednisolone (would have had Hycodan 5mg/5ml syrup, it was on my script, but I couldn't get it, i'm on subs, well I could have gotten it, but my contract with the ORT clinic would have been over, I've had opiate scripts accepted for a very bad injury twice, generic oxycontin 40mg once and later Oxy IR 20mg, but they weren't fun in any way, gave me a hell of a headache, I only stopped taking bupe for 2 days before going on them and well, disappointment, which is why i'm slowly getting off the bupe, but that's all very unrelated). Are doses around 20-25mg like 4-ho-mipt and 4-aco-dmt? Is it anything special, like, as good as shrooms can be. A shame we can't just order 4-ho-dmt ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


I'm also ordering 100mg of pure ibogaine hcl, I'm going to do it at the top of a small mountain in my town, one where people hike often but past midnight, if some people haven't monopolized the top area where the huge red antenna and the cement bench where a whole neighbourhood can be seen (the first place I've done shrooms in fact, we laughed like maniacs the three of us when I said this looks like the model town in Beetlejuice). That's unrelated but it was to follow suit the bupe dependency thing, if I can get rid of it in 2 days which aren't going to be that fun, I can take it, the trip from it surely cannot be as dysphoric as opiate or benzo withdrawal.

Well, I have only tried 4-HO-DPT once so far, but I can make some initial comparisons. Of those three, I find 4-HO-MiPT to have the most obvious body high that feels warm and pleasant and makes me more aware of myself, 4-HO-DPT had the next most obvious high that was less intense overall but significantly more tactile almost to the level of MDMA, and 4-AcO-DMT for me just has sort of a nice background buzzing but nothing too incredibly distinctive. Psychologically, I would say that 4-AcO-DMT was the strongest and reminds me somewhat of DMT in the way that it just overwhelms me into submission, 4-HO-MiPT was much easier but still feels at least as mental to me as an empathogen mixed with psychedelic introspection, and 4-HO-DPT had practically no head trip at all beyond what the hallucinations could cause directly. In that sense, I would say that 4-AcO-DMT and 4-HO-MiPT are definitely both a lot more geometric for me than 4-HO-DPT is, but I would say that 4-HO-DPT has the highest focus on realistic visionary imagery, then 4-AcO-DMT, then 4-HO-MiPT. I would also say that 4-HO-DPT's colors for me are darker in a way similar to 4-AcO-DMT, even though I find the actual colors used to be more similar between 4-AcO-DMT and 4-HO-MiPT than either are to 4-HO-DPT. Even though 4-HO-DPT definitely does share many hallucinogenic effects with other tryptamines, some of the color schemes and imagery detail used are fairly unique among them. Of these three, I would have to say that it is my favorite so far. The doses are much higher than for those though; my one trial was at 60 mg orally and that apparently already makes me sort of sensitive to it. I know that at least a few people have established that 50 mg insufflated is a potentially good starting dose.


Also, good luck with the ibogaine. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

100mg of ibogaine is a pretty low dose, FYI, but you'll feel it for sure, probably get some light trails.

I just received word that this will be available to me from a new source in 1- 2 weeks and I will certainly report back about this one...

Some people questioned the purity of the last batch of material I aquired (due to the high dosages I reported) so I will of course start with an allergy dose and titrate up from scratch but this one has intrigued me above all others (even MXE ) that I've researched. 

The psychedelic headspace and visuals of this stuff is just awesome to say the least. 

I will report back ASAP. ?

You're thinking intelligently. After a few tough lessons I learned the importance of reagent testing and allergy tests, both are good precautionary measures.

I have not and I'm pretty heart broken as I just recieved sone 4-aco-dmt from (who I suspect is) the same vendor and it looks tan/brown (though a nice fine powder) but it reeks strongly of vinigear. 

I contacted the vendor and asked about the 4-ho-dpt and their response was that the 4-ho-dpt was lighter in coulur and doesn't smell as strongly as their 4-aco-dmt. 

I don't care about the colour but it will be very grim to insufflate anything that smells. 

I'm pretty upset... I'll still get some for sure to try out anyways, I'm sure it's probably potent but just not as pure as I would have hoped. 

If anyone could chime in on how to clean up and remove impurities from 4-ho-dpt and 4-aco-dmt please do!!!

I feel there are going to be a lot of people asking this shortly...

AFAIK tryptamines in most cases smell strong (like gasoline, vinegar). DPT was the most reeking substance I ever snorted. I think it does not have to mean, that it has a high proportion of impurities.

I also have some brown, strong smelling DPT and it is of terrible quality compared to my pure white oderless DPT, 

All of my other pure white Tryptamines, (except AMT) have no Odour at all. 

The smell you are talking about is precursor left over from synthesis and insuffilating anything that reeks strongly will be pretty awful. 

I don't know how this otherwise incredible vendor could've found a lab that could make a difficult synth like 4-ho-dpt and not do a rechrystalization to purify it!

Edit:

I have faith that the 4-ho-dpt that's recently become available is probably of very high quality... My concern is only with odour.  The brown DPT I mentioned smelled strongly of vinegar and insuffilating it left that smell for like an hour or more in your nose... It's difficult to get passed that terrible smell and I'm just worried that this 4-ho-dpt might be difficult to research if the precursor smell is too prevalent. 

This chemical is so rare and so unique and just so damn special... I will be getting some very soon and I'll certainly report back on the quality and smell ASAP.

My experience is usually typtmaines shouldn't have much of an odor. I have had 4-AcO-DMT and 5-MeO-MiPT and those chemicals didn't have any strong odors I could notice.

I have the same 4-AcO-DMT. Brown and questionable smell. Very unusual for an otherwise top notch vendor. However, I also obtained 4-HO-DPT at the same time which has no smell and looks as expected (color and reagent test wise). Have not tried it yet, but will report back when I finally do.


Any more reports out there from the most recent batch available in north america?

This is avaiable in my country in the form of pressed 25mg tabs.

Im thinking about getting a bunch to experiment with.


Ive had some profound but extremely terrifying trips on dpt.

Anyone who can compare the space on these two?

I tried this for the first time today. I snorted around 25 mg. After  just a few minutes I felt a little shaky and the music I was listening  to started to have much more depth to it. I reached the peak of the trip  within an hour. The body load was uncomfortable at first but didn't  last throughout the trip. The most notable effects were music  enhancement and a clear but somewhat dissociated headspace. The was also  a lot of tactile enhancement. I didn't get any major visuals but colors  and textures looked very beautiful.


I got a good feel for the effects  from this dose but it was a little underwhelming. I'm usually pretty  sensitive to psychedelics but 25mg seems to be a fairly light dose,  equivalent to maybe 10-12 mg of other 4-subs taken orally. This 4-ho-dpt  is from Canada and is said to be >97% pure.


4-ho-dpt is very  different from dpt. The headspace was similar in that it is pretty  dissociative, but in many ways it is completely different. 4-ho-dpt  seems pretty easygoing without any of the darkness of dpt. If I had to  compare 4-ho-dpt to something else I would say it is most similar to  4-ho-mipt, but more clear headed and a little less shaky body load.

I pretty much agree with your assessment, except that I found the bodyload to be quite comfortable at all times.  It's an interesting one, I've done it at 25mg and 32mg, and I want to try 50mg next time.  It seems quite dissimilar from the other 4-sub-tryptamines.

I've taken it up to around 200 mg nasally. ( though that was in 50mg bumps spaced out during the night and not all at once so tolorance might have played a factor at that point. )

But I found 4-ho-dpt to be really non-ego threatening unlike DPT where 100mg nasally had my ego whimpering in the corner for about 20 mins. 

At higher dosages the way it affects perception of sound is just ridiculously awesome and the visuals are similar to DPT but have a very structured and 3D (think holograms floating in front of you) type of "realness" unlike every other 4subbed tryptamine I've tried. 

This is by far my favourite RC out of everything I've ever tried and it honestly rivals the Lysergermides IMHO. 

The only downside is it seemingly requires a higher dosage than most of the other 4 subbed Tryptamines. 

I'll be acquiring more of this next month and will be running extensive tests!!!

I noticed the sound thing too at 32mg.  I was listening to some old-school synthesizer music from the early 70s, and the directional properties of the sound were the most intense I have ever been able to hear them.  It seemed like the music was building a complex 3-dimensional structure in the room around me.  It was a very unique sound experience, I still think 2C-E is the best sound enhancing psychedelic I've tried but 4-HO-DPT gives it na run for its money, and in a very different way.


I have been putting off my higher-dosage 4-HO-DPT trial but this has me very interested in it again. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Now, this is starting to sound interesting enough to give this a try. 


I gather from this thread 25 to 50 mg's is relatively safe for a first time try, after the allergy test...

Yes, it doesn't seem very potent.  I'd maybe start with 25mg but it likely won't be strong, but you never know... not a lot of people have tested this compared to most.

I attempted IM, but after an hour of heating and adding a bit of acetic acid, we could only get 5mg into solution.  It's almost entirely insoluble (as the salt, it was not freebase).

As far as psychedelics go I found this to be the least awful of anything I put up.my nose and that's taking account the drip.

I've also snorted over 250mg in a single trip so I know all about it lol.

It's not what I might describe as pleasant or anything but if 4-ho-dpt is difficult to snort for you don't even attempt any of the 2-c-x series!!!

Yeah I couldn't get over 25mg at a time up my nose. The drip was too gross, and I've snorted a lot of nasty tasting chemicals. 

It wasn't the burn though, just the taste of the drip made me want to puke for several hours straight.

I don't find it too unpleasant. Yes, it's bitter, but at least it doesn't burn.


Once you begin to associate the bitterness with the lovely effect, you can almost enjoy it. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

With the right ratio you can do it. I used a microwave to heat it, then it was dissolved. About 45mgs. It was amazing!

Of course that would make 4-HO-DMT "Methocin" which could be a little confusing since we have 4-HO-MET = Metocin, but we usually call it "psilocin" so no biggie...

Methocin is redundant due to it being Psilocin due to historic reasons of course but propocin and propacetin would be correct; I already used “Allacetin” in a trip report way back - I don’t know what the argument for and against one or two “L”s  would be and probably doesn’t matter if these drugs have a common name or if it has much use in the real world

You guys have me itching to try this stuff out. Definitely going for it on my next order.  Honestly the worst trip of my life was on DPT..but I was in an iffy place mentally already and I underestimated it's intensity, also the dose was much too high for a tester.  But this sounds great, just need to ease into it...been on a break for quite a while, just gettin' back in the game.

Took 90mg oral; this is perhaps at or nearing a reasonable go - call it a modest +3 since it wasn't too visual and didn’t whisk me away far; depends what your after of course. It wasn’t very colourful like DPT but clear and shiny; perhaps slightly cold though I enjoyed it for the most part. Points of discomfort. There were lot of size distortions - all fairly easy at this level - guess a decent go oral would be 80-120mg maybe more given various sesitivities. I find it strange a reasonable go might be around 100mg but 158mg would be like 750ug acid assuming the author has a correct idea of LSD dose (not knocking you but barely anyone does and LSD is ususally way weaker than advertised - that would be about the sharpest dose response curve ever; still people vary and sometimes-set-setting etc. things can really hit you. What I didn’t like much was there seemed to be rather a cardiac push round the peak - not dangerous but I could see how a large dose could plausibly get a bit threatening so that might explain it. Comedown fairly comfortable and food not problematic.Overall quite good but certainly not outstanding in anyway but then this isn’t a definitive test and it is early days so it might well be pretty good; one lives in hope : )

To what 2C-X would you guys compare 4-HO-DPT when only regarding how hard-pushed it is to become psychedelic and visual? It doesn't stay tame like 2C-B when going up there? Of course I know even the auditory effects described could make this interesting enough as a unique experience of itself, but I don't know how much of a priority to make it if it's not a potent and pleasant psychedelic like 4-HO-MET or extraordinarily alien and trippy like 4-HO-MiPT can be.


Also you probably couldn't get me to IM any 4-HO tryptamine if you have to add an acid to it, I wouldn't quite trust what that does to indolols like this which are not pH stable, and would be reluctant to put any reactive stuff in my muscles. If I ever IVed anything maybe that's different considering how it is immediate access to the bloodstream instead of being stuck in tissue a while.


Couldn't you just plug it to make it more economical? If putting something acidic in your ass is a problem, maybe something like PG is an option, although hold on contact dermatitis or mucous membrane irritation is that rare...? One of the PEGs?

An issue with that might be that PG permeates cells SO well that it could help infections or pulling with it nasty stuff into your bloodstream, even if you don't have pathogens in your rectum there does tend to be other 'stuff' there. Hmm so perhaps not a good idea then.


Maybe an emulsifier like found in soap to help facilitate dissolution of both polar and non-polar part of 4-HO-DPT? Not for IMing obviously but that seems safer for IR.

I unfortunately cannot really make a comparison to the 2Cs, but I can say that I've heard a good few people compare their high dose 4-HO-DPT visuals to a DMT breakthrough. I haven't managed to push that far with it, but from what I have seen I would imagine that it could happen but that it might actually be a bit more like what I've heard DPT described to be like instead, though maybe without the fear some people feel (4-HO-DPT is the calmnest psychedelic I've taken yet).


It may be worth noting though that the people who described having those strong trips seem to also find it quite comfortable even at that point, whereas my 100 mg oral dose was similar to maybe 25 mg of 4-HO-MET in the visions but with much less intense geometry, and I was already finding it to make my body feel a bit annoyingly tight. I'm not sure how I would personally feel about it at a higher dose, but I intend to find out to see the visuals at least once.

Hi guys! Long time lurker, but I only now decided to sign up.


I tried plugging and can say that it definitly hits faster and stronger than taking it orally (at least if my experiences with 4-aco-dpt are anything to go by). However, I used 25% acetic acid and, while I tried to keep the amount of acid as small as possible it still damaged my tissue enough so that I had sporadic rectal bleeding for the next few days (but I didn´t try to get the pH down so in part it´s my fault).


But apart from that the experience was great! I really wish there was an easy way to get that stuff into your body. Someone, please try combining it with an MAOI!


I posted an experience report here: [http://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads...Exactly-what-I-needed?p=13842556#post13842556](https://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads/807897-100-mg-4-ho-dpt-30-mg-allylescaline-piracetam-experienced-Exactly-what-I-needed?p=13842556#post13842556) and also sent a copy to erowid. I hope this redundancy is okay, but I think it´s important to have the information on both sides, since many people only look at one, especially with these lesser known chemicals.

^^ That's weird that you had damage from it, I haven't plugged it but I did snort it and it didn't burn even the tiniest bit, it felt like it was coating my sinuses for a while which was weird but I found it one of the most benign powders I have ever snorted.


EDIT:  I see, you mean because of the acid.  Ouch!  I don't think an acid is necessary, it should absorb without that.

Yeah I know what you mean; there are several tryptamines that are clearly good but a bugger to ingest DPT included - might be this smoke/vaps well like DPT; DPT insufflated is agonising. Tried DPT a few times with an MAOI and it definately brought down the active dose; it still required a fair bit of DPT - got a trip of sorts at 125mg so way more economic to smoke - luckily I guess this 4HO is more potent than the parent though. Smoking 4AcO-DALT was impressive but it wasn’t as easy to smoke as other tryptamines but don’t know how other HOs smoke so it would be curious to know

Oh. I always thought that a substance needs to be dissolved in some fluid to pass through the membranes. But yeah, thinking about it, suppositories are not dissolved and they seem to work just fine. I can be so stupid sometimes! Well, learned something new.

Actually, homemade suppositories seem quite easy to make: [http://www.wowremedies.com/how-to-make-homemade-suppositories/](http://www.wowremedies.com/how-to-make-homemade-suppositories/)


I wonder how it would work with a tryptamine like 4-ho-dpt? Probably better than injecting liquid up the ass.

The first time I dosed this chem, a friend and I ate somewhere around 20 mg each and followed it up with snorting about 10-15 an hour later. Almost nothing happened. Don't take this as fact, because the reason why we dosed so low was to avoid a full fledged death trip so I erred on the side of what 4-ACO-DMT is dosed at and we went from there. The effects were mainly a physical energy which persisted for about three hours with very little visual phenomena at all.


So the next time I took it I snorted 40mg, the taste was horrible in the drip. The effect noted here was the opposite of the other trip, intense lethargy and chill vibes. Visual changes very subtle, limited to light glows and richer colors. SO 40mg snorted was not quite it either. I'll work up to eating around 100mg soon. Seems like that might be the sweet spot and I will decide then how worth it this chem is. I saw another report here which described 25mg as an intense dose but suspect that wasn't HO-DPT? or that person was extremely sensitive to this particular chem. 


In conclusion, although you should always do your own testing like I did starting low, dose seems to run rather high with 4-HO-DPT.

Yeah 4-HO-DPT's dose is pretty high, and in addition, it really is not very much like plain DPT at all.  I can't imagine it producing an ego death type of experience, it's very chill and peaceful feeling at any dose I've tried it at.

Why does everyone seem to love this shit so much? It kinda sucks having to snort 40mg-50mg with that aweful drip, and unless you have grams oral ROA isn't very viable.

I think it's because the effects, if you can get them, are very nice indeed.  For the record I don't find the drip much of a bother, it produces zero pain and it does take a while to dissolve since it's not very water-soluble at all but it tastes only mildly bad to me.


I want to try it orally next time perhaps.  The dose isn't THAT high, maybe 100mg or something?  Kaleida had a trip on it orally I know, she wrote a TR.

It never burned to snort it, it just made me nauseous over like 10mg-15mg intranasally. Under that dosage I suppose it was cool to add to some LSD but otherwise I guess I'm just not a fan.

From what I've read, it seems that it's just a little less than half as potent orally vs nasally, which isn't really that bad. Also it apparently lasts a few hours longer orally, so it's really not a waste.


A good psychedelic experience is priceless. I think it's silly when people complain about how expensive a psychedelic is because they have to spend $10 to go on an 8 hour life-changing journey through their mind.

Hello guys!

I have tried it a few days ago in a dosage of 22mg intranasal. Not enough "Wow!" to write a trip report but there is a definite psychedelic effects noticed with that dose such as colors brightening, change of thoughts and moods, physical changes such as higher heart rate, sweating, stomach and chest disturbances. Started quite quickly, in about 15 minutes. The whole experience lasted about 4 hours prolonged by smoked cannabis throughout the trip. 

I've tried it on an empty stomach with a clear mind and good set and setting but I didnt really enjoy it's effects. Im sure there's something interesting if you go deeper with a higher dosage with it but for me it produces too much of a negative side effects such as increased heart rate and increased blood pressure, weird chest pressure and few little sharp pains probably due to stomach disregulation and/or adrenaline rush, mild fleeting headache and feeling of a "stuffed head".

Going to do more trials with it trying oral administration as well as trying to combine it with extracted Harmaline which might prove interesting, something tells me...) Ill update the thread with the experiences!

Of all the propylated tryptamines Ive only tried 4-HO-MiPT and 4-HO-DPT now, but Im coming to the conclusion that all of them propylated will have a pronounced adrenergic effect on me which apparently I dont like. I have some DPT sitting and waiting for me to pay a visit and not sure how to arrange it now so I won't have the same negative effects. Maybe preload with some natural adrenaline blockers, like Rauwolfia Serpentina (sold as indian OTC med Cardimap)? But Rauwolfia Serpentina has an indole-based alkaloids so it might mess up with the head trip as well, dulling it too much. 

Very unfortunate cause seems like some folks are really enjoying propylated trypts...

On the good note and off-topic, I've really "fallen in love" with 4-Aco-DET recently ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)


I am very happy that all these compounds are still available and hoping for the best for RC industry and people's understanding of psychoactives, may the Blue Light of knowledge shines through all of us!

You may as well take it oral - it's only about double and the amount isn't so relevant if your not that in love with it (and people are in love with alsorts - not alway applicable to someone else)


@volsam yeah orals where I'm interested for now - not keen on other routes unless it's the only way. Be very keen to hear about your hardline trials when they come; the stuff works and can add some of it's own magic

I tried this for the second time today. The first time I tried it I,  snorted 25mg and found it underwhelming. This time, I took 80mg orally.  It was much stronger this time, yet still felt unfulfilling. It was  pretty intense at times, but it still felt like something was missing.  After 4 or 5 hours, I snorted around 10mg of 4-HO-MET, which got me  where I wanted to be.


Honestly, I'm kinda disappointed in 4-HO-DPT. It is pretty interesting,  but it's very different from the other 4-sub tryptamines, and most  psychedelics in general. It doesn't really give you a traditional "trip"  like you would get from mushrooms or acid. I didn't really experience  any euphoria, except maybe for some intense points during the peak of  the trip. I have to agree with people who say it's most similar to DPT.  It's the same type of trip, but with a different personality.


It doesn't feel "recreational" at all to me, but it does seem powerful.  Like DPT, 4-HO-DPT feels very clear-headed, but then when it gets  intense, you find yourself slipping away into hyperspace. I feel like it  has the potential for a powerful breakthrough experience. I think this  has a very steep dose response curve, where at a low dose you feel  pretty sober, but reach a certain threshold and it becomes insanely  intense. 80mg put me right on the edge of that point. At times I felt  pretty sober, yet at certain times, it felt similar to ayahuasca. Take a  low dose and it's not very visual, but take a high dose and you get  intense DMT-like visuals.


I'm curious to see where 4-HO-DPT goes at high doses. I think that's the  appeal of it, as it seems lacking at low doses. It's definitely not  something you would use in the same way you would use other 4-sub  tryptamines. I think around 100-120mg orally is probably where it becomes worthwhile.

I just tried vaporizing some 4-HO-DPT, and it is very effective. I mixed it with some baking soda in a spoon, then when I added a few drops of water, it started bubbling. Then I stirred it with a paperclip and heated it with a lighter to evaporate the water. It didn't form an oil like DPT, but instead shriveled up into a ball.


I put it into a freebase pipe and smoked a small amount. It wasn't much, maybe around 5mg. It took a few minutes to feel the full effects, which were stronger than I expected for how much I smoked. It wasn't that intense, but it came close to my first experience with it where I snorted 25mg. The effects were mostly gone within an hour. The duration seems similar to that of DPT. I think vaporizing might be the way to go for someone who wants a breakthrough experience on 4-HO-DPT.


The drawback to vaporizing is that it tastes pretty awful. I don't mind the taste of DPT that much, but this wasn't like DPT. It is much more chemical tasting, like chlorine or something, and the taste is stronger. It seems to stick to your tongue. I imagine it would be pretty bad for someone trying to vaporize a large dose.

God damn it now I need more to try vaporizing it... 5mg threshold dosage? Maybe now this can become something neat, but having to snort 40mg+ of this awful tasting powder and it's off my list for good. Probably won't ever try oral dosage with 80mg-100mg being needed.

I agree with those saying that snorting 4-HO-DPT sucks - it does suck  and feels "dirty" to me. Smoking it sounds interesting, what kind of  salt were you using cj187? Was that the fumarate? How much was the ratio  of soda/4-HO-DPT and were you following the recipe for DPT freebasing?  Were you heating the spoon?  Maybe there is a way to get a better  freebase out of it, I wonder if someone knows...8)

I  will try it oral next time and will go for a 100mg pure or with 30mg  combined with 120mg of harmala alkaloids. Will post my results! ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I had the fumarate salt. I used 2 parts 4-HO-DPT to 1 part baking soda. I  calculated the molar masses, which gives a ratio of 3.78 to 1, but I  figured it wouldn't hurt to use an excess of baking soda. It reacted in  seconds without heat, then I slowly heated the spoon with a lighter to  evaporate the water. I would heat it a little bit at a time, then stir  it, causing the 4-HO-DPT to clump up. I ended up with a lump of 4-HO-DPT  paste in the middle of the spoon.


I'm starting to think that  vaporization is a very effective method for all tryptamines. Most people  say it's not very efficient for 4 substituted tryptamines, but I think  that's just because they are normally found as salts. There are reports  of people successfully vaporizing 4-HO-MPT that was sold as a freebase. I  think I read somewhere that Alexander Shulgin tried vaporizing  psilocybin or psilocin and it worked. I have vaporized metocin and  miprocin in their fumarate salt forms and I got some effects, but less  than if I had taken it orally. I think as a freebase it would work  pretty well.

I concur with a lot of this; it certainly can be fun/euphoric but might disappoint at too low a dose. I took 95mg oral and was really good - just on the edge of very good indeed. Fully expect it to be transcendental with just a push further on the oral dosing even.

What the...that's a massive dose. 4-HO-DPT and DPT itself are some of my favourite psychedelics, yes, they can be a bit harsh on the comedown, but the kind of dosage you've done is ridiculous. Don't do this at home kids.

Kirkland, are you talking about 4-HO-DPT or diphenhydramine, sometimes called DPH? The latter is what's in the Benadryl you mention, while the former is a research chemical similar to the psychedelic molecule in mushrooms. They are entirely unrelated drugs.


Diphenhydramine is a deliriant and is not generally known for causing ego death like psychedelics. What it does cause, and what it sounds like you're describing, is called delirium. While they are both intense states, there are some very important differences between them. In particular, the ego death experience involves a loss of cognitive support for your sense of self, which can start out similarly to delirium at lower levels that tend to mostly include memory loss, but then becomes more distinct at higher levels as it can start to include things like misidentifying yourself and starting to believe that you are other people living other lives and, at highest level, completely losing a sense of self and just being one with your perceptions. There is more to the experience as well, but that aspect of it is central to it, and is part of why people seek out the experience to feel as though they've gone through a rebirth or expand their empathy or objectivity.


Delirium, on the other hand, tends to leave the sense of self relatively in tact. Rather, it's your ability to form coherent thoughts, recall accurate memories, and process objects in your environment that seem the most disturbed. The most common parts of the experience involve constantly losing track of where you are and who is or isn't real, much like you describe. It may reach a level of hallucination that feels as though you're traveling through other worlds, but even then, your identity tends to either feel the same or go unquestioned. This is a very significant difference to many ego loss experiences, where it's generally either quite clear that you're slipping away or you can feel very distinct identity changes such as suddenly feeling yourself as a person of totally different age, gender, ethnicity, or so on, or even suddenly feeling that you are an animal or some sort of alien being. So, ultimately, while both delirium and ego loss can result in some similarly intensely altered states of mind, they are very different experiences with different cognitive implications.


As for the positive emotional effects you're experiencing now, it may be worth noting that scopolamine, a natural deliriant, has recently been shown to have rapid-acting antidepressant effects like ketamine and other dissociatives, and this appears to be dependent on the muscarinic receptor antagonism that causes the deliriant effects. Since diphenhydramine works through this mechanism as well, it seems plausible that it might also share some of these effects. Though, this is of course just speculation. Regardless, I'm glad that you were able to get something out of the experience.

Ah, forgive me then, I had to ask since I was a bit confused by the wording and the dose, after effect duration, and described effects actually seemed to match up pretty well to diphenhydramine. However, this would certainly not be the first time a very high dose of a psychedelic has produced deliriant-like effects, and the effects you described in your second post sound rather very psychedelic indeed!


Well, based on what you say here then, I would say it does sound like you experienced extreme ego loss after all. Though I would agree that you had a bad sitter for it.... It sounds like she just wasn't very understanding of the experience, of course someone is going to act crazy while they're tripping that hard. But anyway, yes, that living through other peoples' lives and all that is just what I was talking about. The way it plays out varies from drug to drug and trip to trip, but it follows that same kind of theme. The way you describe it here sounds particularly deep and interesting, though it is consistent with my experience and what I've heard about from others with 4-HO-DPT being a highly visionary molecule, and I also find it interesting that you seemed to get some religious themes from it as I've often heard people describe with DPT. You've given me a lot to think about, so thanks much for sharing this.... In retrospect, and with all the details considered, the more delirious effects you described before do kind of make me think of some of my very high dose trips with LSD too, and since I've so far found all propyl tryptamines to give me some distinctly "lysergic" feelings I could see 4-HO-DPT reaching that with such a dose. The way you describe it does sound much more intense and convincing though, and I would expect no less of a full-strength tryptamine.


Also, while I simply cannot endorse any super heavy dosing like that, I must say, for you and also for others reading... that I don't think this dose was particularly insane, health concerns aside. That last point needs to be stressed heavily as this is a relatively unexplored chemical and there is no telling what sort of health problems it could present at what sort of doses, and since this is even a much higher dose than is typically recognized as a super high but safe dose with similar molecules, I would just say that extreme caution is needed and you should feel lucky to be alive and unharmed. However, just in terms of the dose-effect curve, it doesn't sound that bad to me.... As Kirkland said, it's "only" five times the recommended dose. I've taken 100 mg of 4-HO-DPT orally, and it wasn't even half as intense as 25 mg of 4-HO-MET. So, while a jump up to 500 mg still seems undoubtedly high, it really doesn't seem like just the craziest thing ever to me, and the kind of psychedelic effects describe seem like they'd probably be about what I would expect of it from that kind of dosage increase. As it is that this molecule has gotten a lot of peoples' attention and it does have such low potency when taken orally, I expect that this not the last time we will be seeing such doses attempted. So, was it a bright idea? We'll just say that's... debatable. However, I am thankful you survived it fine and grateful you came here to share what you learned.


Thanks for the report.

**Kirkland:** Yeah, taking such high doses could potentially be dangerous... 

Probably the trip disregulated your natural neurotransmitters workings, every neurotransmitter has a role played within the body as well as in the brain so thats why you're feeling it like that. 


If I were you, I'd take it easy on stressful activities until feel better and eat more raw vegetables, take multivitamins daily, as well as take about 100mg of 5HT-P (to replenish serotonin) daily, about 80-150mg of Mucuna Pruriens extract (to replenish dopamine) daily, about 800mg of CDP-Choline (to replenish acetylcholine) daily, and I'd also take 30mg Noopept, 800mg Aniracetam, some Ashwagandha and Turmeric extract, and maybe 300mg Phenibut, all daily until feel happy and healthy again! ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Kirkland, unfortunately it is simply not possible to say what might be normal to experience after a trip like this, as this is as far as I'm aware the highest dose on record by a pretty good margin of a relatively unexplored chemical. The possibilities are essentially endless. This is something that has kept me concerned personally at the idea of consistently going further into molecular structures that are similar psychedelics but with lower and lower potency.... Just because something becomes less potent at 5-HT2A doesn't mean it does at other receptors, which can provide their own kind of drug effects. For example, 4-HO-DPT may be normally dosed around 80-100 mg, making 500 mg seem not that crazy for psychedelic effects, but 4-HO-DPT is based on the structure of psilocin which is normally dosed around 10-25 mg, which means that if 4-HO-DPT retains full potency at any of its non-hallucinogenic pharmacological targets then taking 500 mg could be like taking anywhere between twenty and fifty doses of that kind of drug. While I would imagine that this may to some degree also contribute to what makes some of these bulkier tail psychedelics more unique, it does make me worry about pushing the limits as well, and mostly for reasons related to what you are experiencing now.... After all, how in the world are we supposed to know what to expect after taking such potentially massive doses of a drug? It could very well cause lasting damage just due to off-target effects, not related to the psychedelic effects at all.


I don't mean to say this to try to scare you, it's just food for thought. Humans are pretty resilient, and even though what are you describing does sound like more serious aftereffects than I'd normally expect from a psychedelic, I wouldn't be surprised if you pull through fine once there's enough time between you and the trip. For now, I would just say follow Volsam's general advice, basically live healthy and sober for a little while and see if you start to improve, which I'd imagine you should. And definitely don't be afraid to share updates on your condition with us again.

I'd say a normal dose is going to more like 100+ by how much I can't say at present - that seems the begining and at normal doses I am not thinking this is likely particularly dangerous but great point about receptors not directly involved; this is of course true of just about any RC where the data isn't known - that you don't remember bodyload is encouraging since if other receptors one might suspect some activity at like 5HT1A or 2D were massively hit one might expect also expect bodyload related to that receptors subtype function...


500mg sounds way excessive I think the effects will grow quickly beyond 100, at the same time you have pulled through and even taking massive doses of known psychedelics (and trips of that degree) can be pretty tiring/draining and you could expect it to take a while to get back to normal. You say you have noted some improvement on the 5th and 7th. That much coffee alone I would feel too good.


It is done now so just consider this recuperation time; one thing sure to give symptoms is worrying and assuming you have done "permanent damage" - not only is the body resilient it is often self mending.  A few older members might relate to thinking a physical or mental problem permanent or bound to get worse with time and to discover year on one had forgotten it after it left.


Sounds like quite a trip but while it's sort of good for the rest of us to know a huge dose has been survived edge up a bit slower next time.


I find even 300mg phenibut slightly unpleasant and generally it's not something advisable to take daily but generally all the advise is the same until you feel better

Yeah don't take phenibut daily, it will start to cause physical dependence eventually.  For some it can cause dependence pretty rapidly and cause significant withdrawals, but for most it seems to take a while and be more benign.  It can definitely be a very useful tool in helping to pull you out of a funk, but don't rely on it too much, if you use it, just use it as a way to feel better sometimes, it can definitely help to just get a bit of a respite from a negative state, to help you remember that you can and will feel better.  I'd recommend no more often than once every 3 days, ie, 2 days off in between.  Once every other day will slowly build tolerance but it relatively sustainable for a while too but do not go over that.


I wrote a usage guide for it in trip reports that might be useful:  [http://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads...prehensive-Long-Term-Synopsis-and-Usage-Guide](https://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads/804928-Phenibut-10-Years-Experience-A-Comprehensive-Long-Term-Synopsis-and-Usage-Guide)

I find 55-60mg orally to provide an hindsightful good time, where I get majorly into music, same as with DPT Freebase oil which I smoked in a bowl of a weed pipe, with a screen (that are either for weed pipes or crack pipes) and a lot of cigarette packed to the top in the bowl (like when I was smoking freebase cocaine for 100 bucks a day, I'd make it myself from the best coke available here by delivery service...we're kinda at the end of the road, the final exit of the highway going north here, so crack is rarely sold as is, so crack pipes or those cheesy american fake roses made obviously to be crack pipes are nowhere to be found, that's funny when I hear there's a few vending machines for crack pipes and screens in Montreal. Anyway, DPT is usually obtaing as the HCL, 4-HO-DPT is several times better than 4-aco-dpt to me, no contest.


My next adventure is tracking down 4-HO-DiPT, I know where to get it, but as always I always have a lot of things to buy which are not soul medicine or outright medicine related, started to play my guitar again and bought a Peavey 100 watts amp with transtube tech, sounds exactly like an amp with a lamp, the distortion one can set and stop with the attached pedal to switch in between distortion and clean is ideal for my recent 40 riffs and song structures I came up on 4-HO-DPT 58mg which I recorded with FXBOX, all ya need is a jack to plug your guitar in your sound card's Input and FXBOX is a guitar amp emulator that's highly tweakable, it was amazing in the year 2000-2001, now it's out there, but yeah the clean to distortion easiness is good since I'm listening to so much Nirvana lately, I've written loads of riffs Kurt would have written circa Bleach and Incesticide era and some of In Utero I guess, I don't have it in me to write songs just for the hit factor, although Sappy (In Utero version that was cut from the album at the last minute was supposed to be the first single) is an example of song structure I'm playin with since I got this amp, which I now figured out how to plug to a sound card...the sound card's in the mail. My soul has seemed to come back from this 58mg 4-HO-DPT and 80mg of Ketamine IV, and 4 days later I dosed 30mg of 4-ho-DET and I felt I was cleansed of many bad circular loop thoughts I wasn't even aware I had. Now to get 4-HO-DiPT and 4-HO-MET, I got one dose of MiPT and I wish to mix it with something I don't have still...I haven't much of 4-HO-DiPT, I know it's around, I'm sure I looked at the big and dandy thread but I forget how it compares to what I already am experienced with (lysergamides, tryptamines) when it comes to psychedelics, I've got less experience with phenethylamines and my own country when banning nbomes banned a lot of staple canadian vendor psychedelics that were there for 17 years for us, I managed to get some 2c-b-fly and 2c-E but that is locked down in my safe, I'm sad I didn't get to find any bk-2c-b on time before October 31st. At least the tryptamine adventure is endless.

Just plugged 100mg of this after a small  allergy test nasally. 

Feeling of coming up is strong so far (15mins in)

I will report back in a few hours.

Actually just plugged an additional 100mg lol... this stuff definitely seems to have the same potency as DPT.

Substitution in the 4th position does nothing for potency for some reason unlike the typical Psilocin pattern.

So basically this stuff does not work via rectal administration is my 2 cents... felt a strong come up from nasal allergy test bump then not much from 100mgx2 rectal doses...

Sucks to waste such valuable material but it's good to know this ROA is ineffective.

That's interesting that plugging would not work for 4-HO-DPT

Surprising, considering 100 mg would have some effect orally. Thanks for the info.

I had read on another thread here on bluelight that plugging DPT works better than snorting.... but I have tested 4-ho-dpt pretty extensively...snorting works amazingly but I hate snorting anything so I was really stoked to try plugging it.

The initial allergy test bump had a strong initial effect but 200mg rectal did nothing but give a slight tryptamine come up feel with zero open or closed eye visuals for me or my tripping partner. 

I would not have wasted almost half a gram of this material if didn't think plugging would have worked but it didn't for me or my partner.  

I highly recommend snorting this stuff to get the most out of it...although I will be trying a 300mg oral dose at some point jyst to see how it compared to DPT in terms of oral potency.

I think 300mg oral is going to be a very strong dose; I gave up on DPT orally and can't remember all the details - had some success with the addition of harmaline although 150mg moclobemide + 125mg DPT was still really weak; the long and short of it is this is likely at least as strong as DPT and could be a fair bit stronger - DPT seemed variable orally but it might just be the case that both are just not super potent, but I would think out how much you want to dive in with personally.

120 mg orally was a nice trip for me. Next time I would probably dose 130 - 140 mg, but certainly not 300 mg, which seems like an awful lot.

That sounds about right; yet to push over 100 but it's just on the edge - any details on the 120mg trip Immad?

I've already tried 250mg nasally and found it epic and extremely visual while still being psychologically pretty tame.

I'm not worried at all about 300mg oral.

I've also taken 200mg DPT orally which was a lot more intense than I was expecting...I also barfed on the come down on thst one. Lol

It was approx. two years ago, but I remember the patterning was reminiscent of DPT. It also had some body load, but I don't remember it being unpleasant. Regarding intensity I think I would equate it to roughly 15 mg of 4-AcO-DMT, which is a bit on the light side for me. My memory is vague, but I also seem to remember it lasting around 5 hours.


If you go over the 100 mg, happy trails and let us know! ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Hello, I have written a report for this.... I should get around to uploading my bank of reports to the trip report section @~@


<details>
<summary>report</summary>


Age: 21Weight: 125 lbs

Dosage: 75 mg insufflated

Setting: My apartment


T0:00-Powder insufflated. This was one of the most unpleasant drug administration experiences I have ever had. The powder smells acrid, like something rotten. It is also incredibly fine and chalky. The act of insufflating it disturbed it enough to fluff it into big dust clouds in my throat and sinuses. The dust clouds bear that same acrid smell, and sting anywhere they touch. The main bit of powder has clumped up into an extremely unpleasant and decently painful mess. My throat is sore and the flavor and unrelenting presence of the clouds of powder trigger nausea instantly.


T0:06-Already feel the onset. Textures around me begin to wave and pulse, and physically I begin to feel very light. I begin to get some drip and it is incredibly nasty. The nausea doesn’t feel psychosomatic like with most psychedelics, just my body’s reaction to the gross powder.


T0:12-I am beginning to shake. I don’t necessarily feel stimulated and tweaky, I just feel like shaking my limbs. There is none of that uncomfortable restlessness, just a strange and very neutral sensation of wanting to be in motion. This powder though, it’s just sunken into my face, rotted into my face, it infects the air I breathe and makes everything foul. I cannot wait until it is absorbed into my body and I don’t need to feel or taste it anymore.


T0:15-The visuals which up to this point consisted of some colorful auras and drifting and warping textures begin to really truly take form. It is like some world is assembling itself before me, a mystical and esoteric world that has been hiding in the shadows until this very moment, that is now excited to finally reveal itself to me. The patterns that start to form are incredibly intricate, like a carefully organized tracery of vines, all of their thousands of minute leaves carefully interlocking and tangling in the most beautiful organized way. My entrance into this world feels like I am being met with open arms, it is welcoming and accommodating. The air is vibrating around me, and the walls are feeding on themselves and collapsing inwards. The fabric of reality has folded into a trillion folds, each fold its own unique species in this brand new ecosystem, the facets of existence interacting and feeding on one another in a beautiful trophic harmony. This is all fine and dandy, but physically I feel fucking awful. I am sick to my stomach, I am so nauseous and my stomach and abdomen are cramping with an incredibly uncomfortable pain. Not even intense pain, just an acute discomfort. I am shaking and achey, and that god awful taste/smell is still in my mouth and throat.


T0:30-This is so intense, there is just so much happening around me. Everything around me feels like creatures, not in the traditional sense of a living breathing being, but some odd autonomous sentience. It’s as if reality has synthetically formed itself into tiny subdivsions, each of which has become some odd being that seems to be imitating the human perception of a lifeform. The world is just a great big amalgam of these creatures. I still feel so very sick. I almost throw up, but not quite. I am clutching my trash can for dear life. This sucks but is so cool at the same time. In my notes I wrote “I feel like a palace trapped within itself”. I’m not sure entirely what the literal meaning of that was, or what stimulus triggered that response, but honestly I feel like it describes the state pretty well.


T0:45-The best descriptor I could give the visuals at this point is resplendent, like the most beautiful glistening feathers of the most beautiful bird, blowing in the wind, or perhaps interlocking and unfolding as this great phoenix unfurls its iridescent wings. It surrounds me, it encompasses me and parades as a cascade of feathers around me. The headspace has breached a wall and become strange and alien now. It is like all those odd autonomies entities around me have evolved into a grand sentience woven from the twisted fabric of reality, some sort of overmind or undermind hiding and playing in the shadows of our reality. It had used this trip as a chance to manifest in my reality, but it could not simply spontaneously manifest, it had to lay out the pieces and wait for them to evolve and grow into its final form. And at last the incredibly intricate lacework of its veins and nerves, each borne from their own autonomous beings, had formed into a collective being. That was about as far as it could go. Communication was nil. The best way I could describe the feeling was that something was trying to take me somewhere, but I was not entirely sure what, where, or why. It had put so much effort into forming itself into this world, only to fail at the threshold, finding me completely alien and incommunicable. I wonder if a higher dose would connect me to this underlying consciousness somehow? Also I still felt disgusting and terrible, cramps and aches all over my body and all up and down my stomach and abdomen. At least that awful taste was gone now.


T0:51-I am seeing faces in everything, it’s pareidolia that reminds me of my first few psychedelic experiences, where that was probably the most notable visual aspect. I’m not even entirely sure if I am literally seeing faces however. It’s just this feeling of being watched, or perhaps of my surroundings being represented as some expressive formation, a series of forms that portrays an emotion or action or thought based on sequential changes in their formation. Whatever it is, its surrounding me, staring at me blankly, not even staring at me but staring through me.


T1:00-Bodyload still raging. Bleh. I try drawing, but it looks just okay. Sometimes, with psychedelics, I have a really amplified sense of aesthetics, everything is instilled with a certain artistic harmony and an augmented sense of balance and composition. LSD does this a lot. No such luck with this compound however. The edge of its intensity has come off a little, although I am still tripping very hard and feeling some pretty rockin’ visuals.


T1:30-I would say I started coming down about here. And this is what I was seeking…. The headspace on the comedown is incredible, I feel an unquenchable thirst for knowledge and begin reading feverishly about tarantulas, wanting to learn everything I can about them, mostly to properly appreciate the new pet I acquired recently. My mind feels substantially more functional then normal, conversation flows extra smooth, this is one of my favorite part of psychedelics. The bodyload hasn’t entire subsided but is milder and more manageable now.


T5:00-Mostly back to baseline by now.


T7:00-Fall asleep easily.


Conclusion: 4-HO-DPT like its cousin DPT is an incredibly deep, strange, alien, and biomorphic psychedelic that seems like it has a lot to offer, high doses seem to show the potential for some really interesting entity contact, or perhaps this is best done through combining it with other substances. The major obstacle is the absolutely horrendous ROA and the crippling bodyload. The bodyload is substantially worse than DPT, with awful abdominal aches and cramps and nausea that lasts almost through the entire trip. When the pain finally subsided I felt like I had been dredged and left raw and bare in my pain. Administering it is another hellish ordeal. I have never taken a drug that was so unpleasant to administer. Maybe it’s just this batch but the powder smells and tastes awful, and its so floury that it gets everywhere, and stings whatever it touches. I couldn’t imagine trying to stuff 100 mg or more of this stuff into my face. I tried it orally at 125 mg and felt literally nothing, meaning that if I want to do anything fun with this I’m going to have to snort it. Easily one of the most unpleasant things I’ve snorted, just after MXP.


I had super high expectations for this drug, calling it my holy grail. Psychologically/sensorily it was a very rewarding and interesting experience, but it was hampered by the awful bodyload, which seems like it would also put a cap on further exploration, as it would only increase with dosage. This is a shame, I was really excited to explore this compound and this little taste of it has me even more interested, but I am very put off by the pain and discomfort it also induced. 


NOTE: 

Later tried 125 mg oral in gel cap. Had no effect.

**Nervewing**, thank you for an awesome report! I've enjoyed reading it! :D


The discomfort 4-HO-DPT gives me and the awful drip are the only things that stop me from exploring it deeply, I still haven't tried it with Harmaline - hoping that it would yield the intensity I want without making me sick.


Also strange that plugging it worked for some people as I was reading reports, but didnt for others...

Sometimes, with psychedelics, I have a really amplified sense of aesthetics, everything is instilled with a certain artistic harmony and an augmented sense of balance and composition. LSD does this a lot. No such luck with this compound however. The edge of its intensity has come off a little, although I am still tripping very hard and feeling some pretty rockin’ visuals.

> Conclusion: 4-HO-DPT like its cousin DPT is an incredibly deep, strange, alien, and biomorphic psychedelic that seems like it has a lot to offer, high doses seem to show the potential for some really interesting entity contact, or perhaps this is best done through combining it with other substances. The major obstacle is the absolutely horrendous ROA and the crippling bodyload. The bodyload is substantially worse than DPT, with awful abdominal aches and cramps and nausea that lasts almost through the entire trip. When the pain finally subsided I felt like I had been dredged and left raw and bare in my pain. Administering it is another hellish ordeal. I have never taken a drug that was so unpleasant to administer. Maybe it’s just this batch but the powder smells and tastes awful, and its so floury that it gets everywhere, and stings whatever it touches. I couldn’t imagine trying to stuff 100 mg or more of this stuff into my face. I tried it orally at 125 mg and felt literally nothing, meaning that if I want to do anything fun with this I’m going to have to snort it. Easily one of the most unpleasant things I’ve snorted, just after MXP.

Psychologically/sensorily it was a very rewarding and interesting experience, but it was hampered by the awful bodyload, which seems like it would also put a cap on further exploration, as it would only increase with dosage. This is a shame, I was really excited to explore this compound and this little taste of it has me even more interested, but I am very put off by the pain and discomfort it also induced.

Thanks for the report Nervewing, very descriptive and thorough. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) You've made me even more interested in this chemical, though at the same time also more apprehensive for the same reasons I hadn't snorted it yet to begin with... the thought that the actual administration would suck, and the fear that a higher dose would cause a significant body load. I personally have taken 100 mg orally and I did get a psychedelic effect out of it, though nothing to the level you describe, but even then I did have a heavy and not entirely pleasant body feeling. Still, I think I may give insufflation a try soon now.... My plan is to start with 25 mg and work up, so maybe I can avoid too much discomfort.


If the rest of your reports are that in-depth then yes you should upload them, we'd be happy for the information and entertainment. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

Honestly I found snorting it to be quite easy compared to many substances.  It is quite chalky and slow to absorb, kinda coats the nasal passages which is unpleasant but for me there was no burn at all, and the taste wasn't horrible.  Then again I have a high tolerance for bad tastes in drugs, I generally just put powders in my mouth and swallow them in water.

That's good to hear, hopefully it won't be too bad for me then. I actually recently have stopped reacting so much to the taste of these chemicals taken orally too, so maybe I'm building up that tolerance as well.... Hopefully anyway, as I've definitely had enough nasty chemical experiences to last a lifetime!

I took 85mg of 4-HO-DPT intranasally shortly following an equal amount of intranasal ketamine last night.


Subjectively it was an utterly amazing out-of-body peak experience. I wish I could recall all of the things I appeared to witness properly, but one that stuck with me was interpreted (as best as I can describe it) as being swept up in a stream of extra-dimensional properties that fed into one another, accelerating and accelerating until they collectively formed a singularity that gave birth to the universe and all of the physical laws that define it. I realize that attempting to put it into words like that doesn't really make all that much sense, but it was incredibly vivid and breathtakingly beautiful.


I'm not certain why this particular experience caused me to become so far departed from reality. I have been occasionally adding intranasal 4-HO-DPT dosages ranging from 30mg to 90mg on top of LSD and a variety of arylcyclohexylamines since I first bought a gram of it last summer with fairly consistent and predictable +++ results. Always enjoyable and definitely preferable to DPT in my opinion.


Last night was one of only three trips I have had on any drug or drug combination that has led to a ++++ experience. If I had the words to describe it, I would write a proper trip report, but it something that simply defies description beyond what I was able to say here.

Would 75mg orally be too little for this substance? Not too keen on sniffing psychedelics, especially ones that have propyls as they make me vomit like crazy. I have 150mgs and want to trip with my lover on this on the equinox, but worried that I don't have enough.

If one of you is sensitive it might be enough but mostly I'd say it's too little - I got something of 25 and more off 75 but most think it's full effects at 100 or so

Hi there, I have [Ehrlich](https://www.reagent-tests.uk/product/ehrlich-reagent-2ml/) (2 mL), [Froehde](https://www.reagent-tests.uk/product/froehde-reagent-2ml/) (2 mL), [Marquis](https://www.reagent-tests.uk/product/marquis-reagent-2-ml/) (2 mL), [Mecke](https://www.reagent-tests.uk/product/mecke-reagent-2-ml/) (2 mL) in the post as I want to check my recently acquired 6-apb, 6-apbd and 2c-c aswell. It all came from a supplier that is new to me. All looks good but I want to check before allergy tests. I have found the reagent thread helpful for all of the other it is just the 4-ho-dpt I am struggling with find an image of tests.

Hi, it was at the very end. It took approximately 4 mins to get to this dark olive/brown. Similar reaction to DPT and other 4 subs. It was more olive at the beginning, I'll do another small test as I was more focussed on the end result. To be honest I am not too experienced with reagents but picking it up quickly. Regarding the other sustance I will tag you when I post the test in that thread, feeling confident it's the real deal as my 6-apb reaction I posted in the latest big and dandy was very promising and very purple ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

 Yeah I am fighting with myself over getting another g. Not really sure of the shelf life but treating it like other 4 subs in my collection. Small amber bottles packed full and corked, then sealed in larger amber glass jars with Silica packets replaced every year. Rightly or wrongly I only store at room temp. It is tempting as the the supplier has 4-aco-det. If I could find 4-aco-dpt I would stock up, also interested in the differences between the two.

But why is the potency so low or did I misread something : One needs 50mg for a ++ ? Then it is not more potent than DPT insufflated.

No idea why the potency is so low. I tried 40mg insluffated again last night and had a very mild visual experience but a nice headspace. 


I think I will be trying a much larger oral dose as insluffated is not that pleasant. I can put up with it but there must be a better way.


glad I got two g's so I can experiment with oral dosing.

Some people seem to report insufflation being bad with this but for me I found it just about the easiest psychedelic I've ever insufflated... no pain whatsoever, not too bad a drip either, the worst part is that it's not really water-soluble at all so it lingers in there as a dust for a good while, but it didn't really bother me.

I tried crushing it more this time but still had a sore throats in the first half hour. Once it kicked in I was fine, still interested to try it oral and compare differences. I'll report back when I do.

Yeah, insufflation doesn't bother me much. Then again, due to my sensitivity I never feel the need to go beyond around 20 mg -- maybe if I had to snort upwards of 40 mg, I would find it more of a nuisance.

I had a breakthrough experience on this one last night, I have written a tripreport but I feel like I should still let it rest for a while..... I combined with deschloroketamine to go beyond my mind and body. It was so immersive and beautiful, I hope to experience this again sometime ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) Very grateful for this experience....

I had some doses of deschloroketamine during the day, from noon untill 9 PM, all around 40-70 mg. As I was dissociated I decided to visit the realm of waking dreams properly with a tryptamine. I took about 42mg of 4-HO-DPT and wasn't expecting this kind of full-on trip, but I'm very lucky it happened. One of the most intense and visual experience I have ever had.

I decided to give vaporized 4-HO-DPT another shot. I had previously used sodium carbonate to convert some to freebase and ended up with a gray-green glob of it that turned hard when it dried. Vaporizing that out of an oil burner worked, but had a horrible chemical taste and left a lot of residue behind. I suspected that there was a lot of unreacted 4-HO-DPT fumarate in it, so I chopped it up and used heptane to recrystallize it. The yield was pretty small, but I ended up with some some nice sparkly crystalline 4-HO-DPT freebase. It's a gritty powder, not oily or waxy like freebase DPT and DMT.


I put about 8mg into an oil burner to test it. It melted and vaporized easily and didn't have a noticeable taste. I smoked no more than half of what I put in the pipe, but experienced some surprisingly strong effects. Within seconds, my vision started warping and colors started shifting. The effects do seem different vaporized compared to snorted or oral. The body load was a bit too much. I felt really shaky and had some nausea. 4-HO-DPT already gives me uncomfortable body load normally, but the sudden onset made it worse. It wasn't too bad though because the effects were so short-lived.

I know it's not 4-HO-DPT, but I've had "flying in the sky" trips with 40 mgs of 4-AcO-DPT.  Hey cj187, I'm guessing you had 4-HO-DPT.HCl? Or is it possible to convert the freebase from the fumarate?

afaik, any alkaloid salt can be converted into its freebase form simply by bringing up the ph to a high enough level; cj does mention in the post that it is the fumerate salt being worked with. 


interesting that the 4-ho member of the dpt family produces such a strong bodyload; 4-aco-' has a bodyload, but it is manageable. perhaps it is the slower comeup from the (alleged) acetoxy metabolism.

I read your trip report. I think the acetyl group must make a difference. I smoked about 4mg, maybe even less, and it was a fairly strong dose. I can't even imagine smoking 40mg of 4-HO-DPT. Even 10 would probably be incapacitating. You said you were almost completely back to baseline 2-3 hours after smoking the 4-AcO, but I feel mostly back to normal within an hour of smoking the 4-HO.

FWIW, I have only tried 4-HO-DPT but I didn't find it to have a bodyload at all, it was very comfortable for me.

I recently tried this at 100mg orally after a 25mg test the week before. During the 25mg test I remember feeling some subtle psychedelic effects come and go that made me comfortable taking a higher dose.


I made up 2x 50mg gel caps and planned to take them a couple hours after eating dinner.


T+30 minutes

I had vaped some marijuana after dosing but at this point started to notice increased awareness and sensitivity.


T+1 hour

Somewhere around an hour in I thought I had done it to myself this time. I remember thinking I probably should have started with just one of the capsules. I felt some tension in my body and found it hard to get comfortable lying down. I felt like I was sinking into a hole. I also felt like my heart was racing and my hands seemed to be pretty shaky.


The mental aspect of this was difficult at first. I felt like something had come to take me away and I was hearing a somewhat sinister voice in my head. It's very possible this was a fear (or several) coming to the surface. Several different doomsday scenarios played in my head while I tried to cope with the intense visuals and a bit of anxiety. I felt like I had maybe taken too much, so I started to think about how I could explain what was happening to me to somebody else as if they were looking over me like a doctor. I had visions of going to the hospital for heart problems.


This part of the trip was also super visual. I remember saying that I was seeing rainbows coming out of everything. It had a very wavy and colorful visual distortion and sometimes felt like I was going through tunnels. I was surprised by the amount of visuals from this as I've built up quite a tolerance to psychedelics over the past few months and hadn't been getting many visuals recently from other substances.


Everything around me seemed to be alive in some way, beyond just breathing in and out from visual distortion, and seemed like there was a personality to inanimate objects (walls, pillows, tables, etc.).


It had a very powerful reflective head trip early on. I felt like I was turned inside out and shown things about myself that I tend to ignore but other people probably pick up on. So in that sense it made me more aware of myself. I remember thinking that this was like jumping to the end of a trip early on while being blasted with visuals.


T+2 hours

After I realized I wasn't actually going to die tonight, I started to relax and enjoy the trip. I vaped some more marijuana at this point and that helped calm me down a bit. The visuals were less colorful at this point but everything was still pretty wavy.


The mental trip started to wear down after this as well but still made me question my sanity for another hour or so.


T+5 hours

I had come down pretty quick maybe an hour before this but still had some subtle visual distortion and felt a bit out of sorts mentally. I was starting to be able to concetrate on and follow along with what I was watching on TV.


Overall, this was one of the weirdest, most intense trips I've had. It seemed to pack a lot into the first couple of hours and then taper off pretty quickly after that. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone without a good deal of psychedelic experience under their belt.


I need to try this at 50mg now, which I should have started with this time. I was a bit scared for awhile at the 100mg dose. I should have stopped to check my pulse and blood pressure but didn't want to start freaking out my wife who was in the same room as me. She knew I was tripping but not how mentally uncomfortable I was becoming. I could normally handle higher doses of everything else pretty well, so I'm not sure what happened here. Maybe I'm just really sensitive to this stuff. Either that or it gave me more physical discomfort than anything else, which made me paranoid.

A 2nd trial with this stuff via rectal administration worked perfectly!! The first failed attempt was I think because I didn't get the material to really dissolve into the saline solution very well but with the 2nd trial I used 1ml of vodka (200mg 4-ho-dpt) and it went into solution immediately.

The vodka produced a very slight burning sensation in the ol rectum but it was minor and went away in a few seconds.

This time it was very intense visually and I could not see my hands in front of my face.

The headspace was pretty clear but not nearly as clear as with 4-AcO-DPT  which i think has some definite difference from 4-ho-dpt in terms of visuals and headspace though they obviously share alot of the same qualities.

4-ho-dpt and 4-AcO-DPT are at the top of my list of favourite psychedelics by far with the AcO version seemingly superior for oral administraion ( i found 200mg rectal 4-ho-dpt to be almost equipotent to 200mg 4-AcO-DPT orally ) I found 4-ho-dpt to indeed be orally active but it requires more material than 4-AcO-DPT.

This is life changing stuff right here.

Revisited this last night 130mg insluffated over two hours in combo with 125mg 2F-DCK with THC added in the form of dabs at the tail end to keep the visual spectacular going. Had the most powerful and intense experience of my life. It will take a bit of processing but I will write a very detailed report, this one is very special. I have never had visuals like it and even entities and a presence. I had very little anxiety throughout but at one point I was worried that my psyche was on the edge and gained a scary understanding of what true mania could be like. But after that it levelled out into one of the most beautiful visual spectacles.


in the interests of harm reduction I have built up to this gradually and I have plenty of experience with all of the currently available 4-HO range, LSD, DMT, mushrooms to very high doses. The 2F-DCK took a back seat but allowed me let go enough to enjoy this flavour of hyperspace.


in short this is an absolute gem of a compound at the right doses, I was surprised that gradually insluffating over a 2 hour period had such a potent effect. Not the most pleasant drip but not the worst, and after some 2F-DCK I had forgotten about it.


this trip was very personal due to a huge loss of loved ones this year so once I have processed enough to write a meaningful report. Stunned right now and it was the perfect spooky way to finish Halloween.


I wrote a note to myself on my phone that seems very important - “Take the time, do not have time taken!” I have been thinking a lot about modern society forcing most of us to rush around and before we know it we loose important people to us, I think this message is to remind me that we all have the same time and it’s important to take it now and live in the present.


this was the perfect way to end my first microdosing trial which has seen me quit nicotine and alcohol, and helped me realise that I don’t need to quit everything just change my relationship to drugs in general and ensure I always have intent.


much love!


**just wanted to add that I may have a fair bit of tolerance due to 1P-LSD micro dosing and a few tryptamine experiences recently**

Surprised this threads so dead. I tried 60mg plugged - next to nothing but reading here you need vodka to make it work but it isn't clear there is much potency increase. Weirdly 4HO-MET didn't seem that potent I.R. 15mg was way weaker than 30mg oral. Anyway last time I tried 120mg 4HO-DPT whilst fasting. Bit shaky-juddery coming up then it blossomed and it is lovely stuff. Someone here said 120 is nice but they would prefer 130-140mg and that sounds about right and wouldn't be excessive. Residual stim/baseline perhaps 11hrs or so. It's likely more potent that DPT - the best I ever got with that orally was 125mg following a decent dose of harmaline.

I know your experience wasn't totally positive but have you retested this - the potency you report seems a bit unlikely given it's strength by other routes indeed you were surprised yourself, no chance there was anything else left in the pipe? Could be one of those idiosyncratic responses. Not much left so I might try smoking the Hcl. salt and see if there is a massive jump in strength

I wouldn't have done it without making sure the pipe was clean first. I don't think I tried it again after that but I had done it a few times before with the impure freebase 4-HO-DPT and I was impressed by it's potency those times too. I'm not quite sure what the dosage was but I don't think I inhaled much more than a few milligrams.

How did you get it into solution?  I tried to IM 4-HO-DPT once and my friend and I managed to get 5mg into 3mL of water after like a half hour of heating and stirring (verified when we evaporated the rest and 5mg was missing).

As a kind of foreword, I'll post this small report regarding a test that I conducted in April:


"I tried this one for the first time last night: 110mg, orally. Onset began at scarcely fifteen minutes. The buildup was furious, like a roar. At first, I thought that this would be heavier than expected -- I even thought that things could go south -- but toward the end of the transition, I felt fine. The peak, which was exhilarating, came one and a half hours post-ingestion. Visuals were quite strong, along with the body high and euphoria. I obtained useful insights regarding marriage and aging. Sexual activity was good. The return to baseline began during the fourth hour. This return was smooth, with occasional bursts of eye-candy. During this phase, I did some house cleaning, stopping every now and then to take in the shimmering colors (which, alas, became less and less pronounced). The experience was over at the eighth hour, with some residual effects for another two. I experienced no bodyload, except for mild queasiness during the early stage of the onset, and slight headache/neck tension during the residual effects phase. This was a very enjoyable trip."


Fast forward about three weeks...


Two days ago, I tested 4-HO-DPT again, but this time I took 120mg, orally. Things were very similar to my previous test until approximately the third hour. At that time, the trip began to unexpectedly intensify. Simultaneously, I began to experience a pollution- and pollen-related allergy attack. These attacks usually require me to violently expel thick (but clear) mucus from my throat, so I went to the bathroom to do that.


The attack was relatively moderate, so I finished expectorating in less than fifteen minutes. However, during this episode and for another hour or more, the drug's activity continued to rise at an alarming pace. In view that the effects should have by now begun to dissipate, rather than dramatically escalate, I thought that perhaps the supplier of the chemical accidentally mixed something with my material. The escalation continued to the point where I genuinely believed that I took a large overdose of a DOx compound, or perhaps 2C-P or (somewhat less dangerously) a lysergamide.


Four hours after ingestion, my heart rate was so fast, and my vision so impossibly altered, that I began to panic -- I thought that I was about to meet the chef (I felt a spiritual presence), or at least have a seizure. I took 1.2mg of alprazolam and prepared to walk to the nearest hospital.


The walk took considerable effort, but I arrived in less than ten minutes. I was placed on a bed and given oxygen. Meanwhile, the nurses attached some wires to my chest and discovered that my heart rate and blood pressure were indeed far from normal, but not quite life-threatening. They then took blood and had it analyzed in a hurry. The result showed that my glucose level was jacked, so they hooked me up to an IV drip.


Shortly after that, I began to feel better. I also noticed that the trip's intensity began to quickly subside. Two hours after I arrived in the hospital, I was physically fine and completely sober, so I walked home, ate a small snack and went to sleep after I digested a bit. The total duration of this test was about eight hours, which matches my previous one.


So what happened?


It couldn't have been adulterated material (DOx, 2C-x, lysergamide, or even another 4-sub, et al.), because the experience would have been lengthier, not to mention that physical effects would have been more detrimental, or possibly deadly.


It couldn't have been set and setting, because both were good and familiar.


It couldn't have been my diet, because I eat very well and healthily. I'm not overweight or underweight. I don't smoke anything. I rarely drink (the last time was three or four years ago).


It couldn't have been a drug interaction, because I take none, except nasal antihistamine.


The only things that could have caused this response are, in my opinion:


* The coupling of an allergy attack with a strong trip (i.e. the coming attack turned the mental space into a somewhat negative one, which fed the allergy attack proper, which fed the mental space further, which resulted in a glucose imbalance).


* 4-HO-DPT itself. It's very possible -- and this has been mentioned before -- that this chemical possesses an unusually steep dose-response curve, perhaps beginning at around 80mg (orally). 120mg may be too much for most people with no tolerance, even experienced ones. Another possibility is that it metabolizes in a way that can cause health problems, at least with some users.


* I may be developing diabetes (although I don't see why).


Lesson: Be very careful with 4-HO-DPT, as there may be more to it than we know so far. Titrate and monitor.

Glucose was about 20% higher than the normal maximum and myoglobin was nearly double the normal maximum. The other measured parameters were normal and on the lower end of normal.

**Zeta:**


Ah, it's no wonder I missed this, lamanogaucha! It happened just about a month before I finally returned here from a long absence. I very much appreciate you linking me to the full story. Also, before getting into my more scientific response, let me just say that I am very thankful you are okay and nothing worse occurred! And I am very happy you recognized what was happening and went to the hospital when you did.


I must say, this is highly concerning. Speaking only from my *incredibly* amateur perspective on this matter, I feel I must mention that that it sounds very much to me like you may have been experiencing rhabdomyolysis. In case you aren't familiar with it (and again I am no medical professional so please take my word with caution, but I am basing this on widely available and regularly repeated information), rhabdomyolysis is a condition involving a rapid breakdown of skeletal muscle. While there are many things that can cause it and thus it is somewhat difficult to nail down with absolute precision, one of the most common (but to my knowledge not ubiquitous) signs of it first of all would be muscle weakness; I don't believe I saw you mention this directly, but correct me if I'm wrong in thinking that there may be a hint of it in your claim that "[t]he walk [to the hospital] took considerable effort...." More definitely relevant to what else you had to say, **one of the primary symptoms of rhabdomyolysis is significant leakage of myoglobin into the system**, potentially leading to kidney failure. Furthermore, rhabdomyolysis can be treated to full recovery **if promptly administered IV fluids**.


You may or may not know this, but rhabdomyolysis is a rather common severe and potentially lethal effect of "overdoses" of certain psychedelic drugs. It is documented in a significant number of NBOMe death cases, and [a scientific study has already directly linked 25B-NBOMe-mediated 5-HT2A receptor activation to rhabdomyolysis in zebrafish larvae](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5552826/). Rhabdomyolysis has also been documented in non-NBOMe psychedelic emergency reactions such as with [DOC](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=2672531906374277412&hl=en&as_sdt=5,44&sciodt=0,44), [5-MeO-DiPT](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0025619611619058), **and [DPT](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?journal=J.+Toxicol.+Clin.+Toxicol&title=Tachycardia+and+rhabdomyolysis+after+intentional+ingestion+of+N,N-Dipropyltryptamine&author=R.M+Dailey&author=L.D+Nelson&author=J.M+Scaglione&volume=41&issue=5&publication_year=2003&pages=742-743&)**. In the case of DPT, it was also noted to occur alongside tachycardia. For what it's worth, [5-HT2A receptor stimulation has also already been documented to be able to increase glucose levels](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9128844), and of course serotonergic systems in general are already well-known to be able to affect blood pressure and heart rate.


I would very strongly recommend that all current and aspiring psychonauts take this very important lesson to heart:


*JUST BECAUSE IT'S A TRYPTAMINE DOESN'T MEAN THAT IT'S SAFE TO PUSH THE DOSAGE INFINITELY*.


I do not mean to suggest that you were being particularly irresponsible in this case, lamanogaucha, as the dosage you took is not outside what I have heard about before or would have roughly expected translated from the dosages people were taking through non-oral routes of administration. In fact, we have taken 100 mg of 4-HO-DPT orally ourselves based on this reasoning, though while we didn't have an emergency reaction such as you did here, the body load we received at that dosage was already miserable, and it is what prevented us from pushing it further or taking it again in any way as of yet.


Everything I have said so far was based on research and information that I specifically tied back to 5-HT2A receptor stimulation. However, I would also like to make a more theoretical note, to be taken with a grain of salt at this point in time, that we have been doing additional research in our spare time that has led us to believe that most if not at all tryptamines can probably also produce anticholinergic effects if taken at high enough dosages, dosages that may not always or often be too relevant to the effects of most of them, but especially including the kinds of particularly large dosages required for tryptamines such as 4-HO-DPT. There are many claims throughout this thread and elsewhere that 4-HO-DPT, especially in particularly high dosages, can produce hallucinogenic effects that are unlike what the users are familiar with on most other psychedelics and tend to involve more realistic hallucinations, which would in and of itself be similar to anticholinergic deliriants, and, while it seems like the posts may have been deleted, there was once a report in this thread of taking 500 mg of 4-HO-DPT orally that resulted in what sounded to us at least like a complete anticholinergic delirium, including the conversations with people who weren't really there. While most of the time we have been researching the potential psychedelic-deliriant overlap personally out of curiosity related to how it might impact the hallucinogenic and mind-altering effects of these substances, it is also worth considering that altered heart rate, blood pressure, and glucose levels, as well as rhabdomyolysis have all been documented specifically as a result of taking anticholinergic drugs as well, and thus, if 4-HO-DPT (or other similar tryptamines) does have this kind of activity as well in addition to its standard serotonergic properties, its risk of having these problems occur could also be greater relative to other psychedelics.


On that note as well about people who have already taken dosages of this in the order of several hundreds of milligrams orally and survived, let's not forget that people have died on much smaller dosages of NBOMes than others were perfectly fine on.


I need to wrap this up now but that's about all I have to say about this so far anyway. Does any of this sound on point to you at all, lamanogaucha?


Also, I'm curious, what nasal antihistamine are you employing? Particularly because many antihistamines also have anticholinergic effects, which could of course plausibly increase the risk further both additively with any potential anticholinergic effects of 4-HO-DPT and independently from them if it doesn't really have them for the same reasons it having them could increase the risk on its own.


Once again, I thank you very much for the thorough report and warning as well, and hope you are feeling fully recovered and healthy as of now.

Thanks for the very informative post, Kaleida -- it's certainly on-point -- and thanks also for the good wishes.


A case of rhabdomyolysis is a distinct possibility here, and that's what I've suspected for some time. Although my walk to the hospital was arduous primarily due to my near-inability to see -- visual effects were ferocious -- I did feel quite weak, as if my muscles had gone through an intense and chaotic workout. Further, my urine was unusually dark for several hours, which also suggests rhabdomyolysis. The things that I described earlier, along with your observations only reinforce this suspicion.


Physically, I recovered quickly, but psychologically, it took longer -- a week or two. You see, I didn't mention that shortly after my treatment began, an unconscious 16-year-old boy was rushed into the ER and placed a meter away from me, only to die in spite of the doctor's frantic efforts at resuscitation. As you can imagine, having a person, especially a young one, expire next to me in my then-current state demanded considerable mental robustness to handle correctly. I was shaken, but not beaten. The doctor later told me that the boy probably died due to some natural cause(s), but that only an autopsy and tissue/blood analysis could reveal the culprit(s). To be frank, I'm uncomfortable with the realization that the boost in my appreciation of life and its fragility came at the cost of witnessing a child's death. It's hard, but that's life. I'm fine.


My nasal antihistamine is azelastine hydrochloride. I take it one to three times per day on most days.

Yes, it was, but it served as an important life lesson. My only regret is for the pain that the boy's family were going through. I saw that too.

Wow, that is... rough. That's an underwhelming word but I'm pretty sure you couldn't capture that in words. I'm honestly not even sure what exactly is the right comforting sort of thing to say to that, if such a thing even exists.... I couldn't even type that sentence without starting to cry a little.


I don't want to say that I'm glad about any of it, but I am that you handled it well enough. It's not like there's anything that could have been done anyway or that this isn't happening everywhere around the world even right now sadly or that this particular event had anything to do with you at all, but nonetheless, I can certainly understand empathetically as much as one can your struggle.... Again I don't feel right thinking of it as the kind of thing one *should* make peace with but I do hope you can retain yours. As you said, that's life....


I'm happy to provide some potential insight and thank you for the follow-up as well. Frankly, your experience of urine discoloration makes it all but certain in my mind that you did have rhabdomyolysis. This is an extremely important piece of perspective for us to have about 4-HO-DPT and I again thank you for bringing it to our attention.


I appreciate the clarification about the antihistamine as well. I'm not very familiar with azelastine myself but it looks like it's not known to have significant anticholinergic activity, so we can probably at least cross that particular potential condtraindication off the list.


Again, I'm glad that you're feeling better now, and glad that you'll be making a separate post about it too as it'll probably reach more users that way.

120mg good god....regular DPT, if you want to trip hard, ayuhasaca-style but don't have DPT oil freebase (that's how I learned what DPT was, it's an oil when a freebase, pretty difficult to smoke at first, but it can be done easily with whatever kind of pipe my friend had then, likely a crack pipe), 100mg oral of regular DPT is one crazy experience, the 4 or 5 substituted tryptamines always need much less


Typically all 4-HO/4-ACO are at heavy doses when one is at 40+ mg. Be careful.

4-HO/AcO-DPT is less potent than most 4-subs, same deal with some of the other long chain ones like 4-HO-MALT and 4-HO-EPT.  But yeah, definitely start low because some people seem to find it pretty potent, while most don't.

As Xorkoth pointed out, 4-HO-DPT and its AcO variant are less potent by weight than DPT. The same is true relative to most other 4-subs.


Considering only potency by weight, my 110mg 4-HO-DPT trip felt more or less analogous to 30mg of 4-HO-MiPT -- a good, solid dose (if the material is pure), but by no means excessive. On the other hand, my 120mg 4-HO-DPT trip felt like an overdose of 4-HO-MiPT -- 60mg or more, I would imagine.


Anyway, my future 4-HO-DPT tests will be in the range of 80-100mg. If I get bitten again, I'll discontinue use of this compound.

Good luck. Thanks for the answer. It just seemed a bit crazy to me to take as much of a 4-aco/HO substitution since the doses of those D*T compounds that work orally without using a MAOI, DPT demands a large dose, which is always...an insane trip. I loved smoking DPT freebase oil (it's got a funny colour too) at 15mg dosages, the closest I got to DMT, never got around to it and the Ayahuasca way of vomiting for hours instead of just a little like with Mescaline analogues I tried (Escaline, Allylescaline, Proscaline, have yet to try Methallylescaline....that one's a long duration one, LSD long, maybe a bit more, so I was always way cautious about it, so much I have never tried it).


I know I could extract DMT out of a summer's worth of lawnmower use from huge garbage bags of grass but that'd be a wee bit too long ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) But smoked DPT was nuts, but short and controllable, one of my most, not negative, but surprisingly intense as hell for 6 hours was eating 125mg of DPT, oral doses are normally around 100mg, had tried 90mg and it was cool but I knew it had more potential. That was when I could find DPT for $ It's still legal up here but they all want altcoins, eh, I played BTC well enough I don't want to turn some into lesser crypto, but that's another thread...

well to recap I said "last time I tried 120mg 4HO-DPT whilst fasting. Bit shaky-juddery coming up then it blossomed and it is lovely stuff. Someone here said 120 is nice but they would prefer 130-140mg and that sounds about right and wouldn't be excessive." so I took 140mg whilst fasting and it was incredibly weak although duration extended a little. This stuff is incredibly irregular regards dose this isn't the first time a lower dose was subjectively stronger than a higher one. One trip my heart raced (and higher BP) for a bit but that was a yet lower dose so maybe that was anxiety but working out dosage - on 140mg there was no indication of elevated heart rate or anything of that nature.

I've read over this thread carefully last Sunday before I did my experiment and this is my contribution thus far, there will be more experiments, but take from it what you will. This was my experience.


Some of my detailed reports have been inspired by Kaleda (probably incorrect spelling). But I have been reading her trip reports on Erowid for years and finally decided to get into a little bit of science myself in the last little while. The whole process has been very cathartic.


##### 73 mg 4-HO-DPT w vitals to the 3rd hour

I've been saving this for a special occasion. When my health is in order and my set and setting are appropriate. It is about 7:40 in the morning Sunday October 6th 2019, and I am about to ingest 73 mg of 4-HO-DPT on a completely empty stomach. Girlfriend is going to work for the day and she kind...

Interesting. I have a bunch of psys in my safe and autumn is making me feel down, it used to be the opposite, I used to love autumn when I was 18-25, when it's still warm enough to hang out around here, which isn't every year. This little mountain in my town is calling me though, I'll either have 4-ho-dpt or 4-ho-det, failing my ability to find shrooms (my best shroom trips were all during october way back when I was a young lil' psychonaut with my old friends, bandmates etc.). I haven't tripped since august 2018 (ETH-LAD 150ug). The last time I had a tryptamine I got into full ego dissolution, looking at myself in the mirror I felt like I looked like a thumb on some extremely large hand and it was a too large dose of 5-meo-mipt (13.5mg). I had made 5mg capsules but I found them weak...and was a bit wreckless, the physical stimulation from 5-meo-mipt is way too extreme, I think something close to psilocin like this should work great, I feel like I'm in the zone where no bad tripping is possible, I can feel luck sometimes, I'll tell y'all about it, likely will be next friday, forecast is 10c during the evening...which is warm enough to hang out on top of a small mount, I'll have a campfire maybe and maybe if my s/o isn't working her ass off in her underfunded hospital, having her around would be better although I never feared tripping alone.

Cool, hope you have a nice trip. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  My girl is away for a month or so and I'm planning to take DOPr sometime within that month, in a full dose.  I feel like that would be a good drug to be alone with.

Vaporizing that out of an oil burner worked, but had a horrible chemical taste and left a lot of residue behind. I suspected that there was a lot of unreacted 4-HO-DPT fumarate in it, so I chopped it up and used heptane to recrystallize it. The yield was pretty small, but I ended up with some some nice sparkly crystalline 4-HO-DPT freebase. It's a gritty powder, not oily or waxy like freebase DPT and DMT.

I smoked no more than half of what I put in the pipe, but experienced some surprisingly strong effects. Within seconds, my vision started warping and colors started shifting. The effects do seem different vaporized compared to snorted or oral. The body load was a bit too much. I felt really shaky and had some nausea. 4-HO-DPT already gives me uncomfortable body load normally, but the sudden onset made it worse. It wasn't too bad though because the effects were so short-lived.

Right I tried a tiny bit vaped 5-6mg just reread and see you had effects slightly higher but didn't smoke it all; I would have expected 50mg or so to be effective so was very curious about this - I got no effects at all but have just noted you used FB (not sure how much more potent that would be and I am not making a freebase ever again - it is just to risky

So i think this is the most unusual tryptamine ive ever experienced...

It seems to have its most potent effects orally with (in my experience only!!!!!) About 25mg oral being a light dose and 200mg being an sort of equivalent to 5 hits of acid type of "all in" trip.

But snoting this stuff has no nasal burn whatsoever but it it is much lighter in terms of intensity intranasallly than orally mg to mg....that is 100mg oral for me is completely tripping experience , whereas 100mg intranasal is a very light experience.....i tried 100mg via rectal administration tonight and only got a slight hint of something...i am curious as to why this would be more potent via oral vs nasal or rectal????

I have no idea. There seem to be conflicting accounts based on which ROAs are active with this and its acetylated sibling. Dosages vary wildly.

I just wanted to share this incident on here as I had. Strange reaction at the end of my last experience with this compound: “ I want to start by saying I am very experienced with tryptamines and phenyethlamines and have research most the available 4 substituted tryptamines multiple times. I am a regular and sometimes daily user of kratom and have used it at the tail end of many trips.


This time I decided to insluffate 60mg of 4-HO-DPT (have doses up to 110mg before without issue) and had a beautiful experience with flowing visuals etc. At the end of the experience I decided to dose 3g of a Red Maeng da kratom and went to bed.


What proceeded was a splitting headache, nausea and vomitting for over half the following day.


Now I am thinking I could have not drank enough water for that dose of either or the take away burger I had the previous day didn't agree with me.


I know I am a sample size of one and I have taken kratom after a lower dose (40mg) of this compound Without issue.


The reason I am posting it here is I read somewhere that DPT, EPT, MPT versions of the four subs may have some SSRI activity which kratom is known for but I cannot find a source. Please if anyone knowns more correct me. 


I am fully aware mixing RCs with natural herbs that aren't that well studied along RCs of the same carries risk. What I am trying to ascertain is if there could be a much higher risk with these types of tryptamines Vs traditional ones. I have combined with mushrooms, mescaline, acid, 2C-x .... Without feeling like that. For harm reduction it would be good find out more to share across the community.


I will try again once I understand more about the method of action for each substance to rule out of it was isolated.


Appreciate there are so many variables here but I am really reaching out to see if anyone has had something similar or has sources etc.”

Interesting, thanks for posting.  I have only tried 4-HO-DPT a few times but I have definitely combined kratom with it.  I have actually never heard of kratom having SSRI effects and I have also combined it with serotonin releasers like AMT, MDMA, etc, and never had any issues.  I wonder if it was just coincidence and there was some other reason for your effects (like some brief illness, or something you ate)?  I am also curious as to whether anyone else has experienced something similar... if there is some potential interaction it would be good to know.

This was where I saw a reference to it - [Potential for Kratom as a Antidepressant](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7309668/). I will be experimenting again carefully as like you I have taken it with Kratom before without issue, it was just a horrible experience. Really hot/flushed with an ice pick headache and vomiting. I haven’t drank in two years and live pretty clean apart from the occasional take away burger Lol.

Damn that sounds shitty.  I once combined 4-FA and 4-HO-MET, which I had combined before, and after a while I became nauseous and got a most horrific gut pain I have ever experienced, I almost called 911 it got so bad.  I was laying in bed screaming at one point, sweating buckets, a cold sweat, trying to find a position that hurt less, to no avail.  Then after some hours, it got better and I fell asleep and felt fine the next day.  Before it got horrible, it was extremely euphoric and great, but I never tried the combo again because it was so bad that time.  No idea why it happened.

I've had a strange reaction to mixing a fairly medium dose of 4-HO-MET with etizolam and MDMA.


It seemed like such an incredibly strong dose as I'd only ever gone to ~17 mg initially with little 5 mg booster a few hrs in, and this occasion I took 25 mg and dosed a friend with 21 mg. The beginning was pretty cool, but it continued to develop for a few hours and at about the 3rd hour of peaking hard, we started to slowly introduce etizolam at about 1 mg / Hr to take the edge off. That's not really the point of this story but I'm getting there.


It was of note that the etizolam took the visuals away immediately. No more shimmer or shine, just more of a body high with some slight psychedelia. We watched "Ready Player One" and it was pretty fucking epic haha. Anyway the part that really lines up with the experience that [InPlantsWeTrust](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/527361/) had was when we started doing MDMA because we sobered up too much from the etizolam haha. We did something like 200 - 300 mg each and fell asleep on the kitchen floor cooking sausages. I woke up to a smoking pan about an hr after we decided we each needed to lay on the floor for "just a second". Passed out cold and anyway, burned the food, re-made it after tossing the burned food. Went to bed after eating and I woke up still so high, and I've had plenty of acid nights and M nights and this M at the tail end of the tryptamine just hung around inside my system forever.


I took 1G of Kratom the next day to take the hangover down and I was SO fucking high. It was the most clear headed I had felt in months oddly enough, but it was like the chemicals I was taking hit 5X harder and lasted 3X longer. I had a serious depressed episode for about 10 days after and just felt depleted beyond many of my past experiences with any single substance on their own, it made me think perhaps the tryptamines have a slight sort of MAOI effect, or as you fellas had mentioned perhaps some sort of SSRI activity. Also made me realize that the pattern of drug use we followed that night was unwise. I did want to push the 4-HO-MET experience a little further, but I should have had my follow up drugs pre dosed and planned to keep inside a safe limit. There is parts of the night that are fuzzy and I can't remember very well, and my friend started talking to people that weren't there at one point on a walk we went on. It definitely turned me off to getting high for a while. And I feel almost perma-sensitized to stimulants, but I think that has a lot to do with the last 2 years of intermittent etizolam use and perhaps memantine and ketamine use.


I usually take etizolam at the tail end of a heavy tryptamine experience, but this time was a little different. Just very depleting, heavy experience but the dose was higher than usual and some extra drugs were in the mix. Interesting to hear it (the purported some how SSRI or MAOI activity) from somewhere else too though, albeit with some differences in compound, dose and overall drug mix and duration. The next day Kratom though really was something else, it had been about 20 hrs after the tryptamine administration.


Microdosing on tryptamines is way different, but they do seem to burn me out way worse than good old LSD microdoses

It seems to be mostly DPT, this article shared to me on Reddit and I quote them suggests:


![pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.bluelight.org/community/proxy.php?image=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov%2Fpubmed%2Fpersistent%2Fpubmed-meta-image-v2.jpg&hash=60139e87a9c8640158d1b284c92d97fa&return_error=1)


##### Dimethyltryptamine and other hallucinogenic tryptamines exhibit substrate behavior at the serotonin uptake transporter and the vesicle monoamine transporter - PubMed

N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) is a potent plant hallucinogen that has also been found in human tissues. When ingested, DMT and related N,N-dialkyltryptamines produce an intense hallucinogenic state. Behavioral effects are mediated through various neurochemical mechanisms including activity at...


![pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.bluelight.org/community/proxy.php?image=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov%2Fcoreutils%2Fnwds%2Fimg%2Ffavicons%2Ffavicon.png&hash=38a93253fc15d6430d52f4a6d11ea7d5&return_error=1)

					pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
				


Our results show that DMT, MIPT, DPT, and DIPT inhibit [(3)H]5-HT transport at the SERT with K ( I ) values of 4.00 +/- 0.70, 8.88 +/- 4.7, 0.594 +/- 0.12, and 2.32 +/- 0.46 microM, respectively.


"So DPT is several fold stronger as a sert reuptake inhibitor then DMT"


So we can safely assume blanket assume to play it safe anything that ends in PT, IPT can. And where Kratom is involved it has so many alks in it we really are in uncharted territory with these substances. It also seems dose dependant. We are just toying with the idea. It's all needs proper study and statistical significance but we know we are still a long way off that so best to play it safe and limit what we combine.

Just very depleting, heavy experience but the dose was higher than usual and some extra drugs were in the mix. Interesting to hear it (the purported some how SSRI or MAOI activity) from somewhere else too though, albeit with some differences in compound, dose and overall drug mix and duration. The next day Kratom though really was something else, it had been about 20 hrs after the tryptamine administration.

Thank you for contributing this. I would always be careful taming kratom on or close to MDMA use. Many will say they have been fine but I keep seeing more and more about kratoms SSRI "like" effects. It cured my depression and now I don't need it daily which to me made it more effective than an SSRI.

MiPT has been said to have some similar effects. I'd read that Foxy (5-MEO-MiPT) can have some negative interactions when taken alongside other drugs

So it seems 4-HO-DPT fumarate is highly insoluble in water....I'd like to try to freebase it to vape...

Can anyone with chemistry knowledge give any ideas ....there MUST be a way.

Any advice would be tremendously appreciated!

Vaporizing that out of an oil burner worked, but had a horrible chemical taste and left a lot of residue behind. I suspected that there was a lot of unreacted 4-HO-DPT fumarate in it, so I chopped it up and used heptane to recrystallize it. The yield was pretty small, but I ended up with some some nice sparkly crystalline 4-HO-DPT freebase. It's a gritty powder, not oily or waxy like freebase DPT and DMT.

I smoked no more than half of what I put in the pipe, but experienced some surprisingly strong effects. Within seconds, my vision started warping and colors started shifting. The effects do seem different vaporized compared to snorted or oral. The body load was a bit too much. I felt really shaky and had some nausea. 4-HO-DPT already gives me uncomfortable body load normally, but the sudden onset made it worse. It wasn't too bad though because the effects were so short-lived.

Interesting!!!

I completely missed this post...but I'm going to be running some conversion experiments in the next few weeks to see what would be the best way to freebase this stuff...I'm not in any way adept at chemistry so I have a bunch of most likely silly ideas of how to approach this....can you basify alcohols???

I wonder about dissolving 4-ho-dpt into the smallest possible amount of propylene glycol then adding baking soda and just seeing what happens....no idea if this is completely dumb or absolutely brilliant but without some solid chemistry advice it'll be a lot of trial and error...


EDIT: 

Found this on another forum

"I had some success with using a flame to boil it with water in a spoon to increase solubility, as well as with adding propylene glycol, which seems to increase solubility as well as the viscosity of the mixture, enabling the undissolved portion to form a more uniform suspension."

My first thought would be to use boiling water, add the base (bicarbonate) and 4-ho-dpt hopefully it goes into solution at that temp and then use Naptha to recrystalize through freeze perception just like what's described in a DMT extraction tek...

If I have time I'll post my results next week!

the thing with MOXY (5-meo-mipt), is that probably has a lot of receptor interaction going on, affecting so many things at the same time, the serotonin aspect is quite obvious on its own, and the "physical involvement" seems quite clear too, (I know that is not a scientific way of talking but well..). 

There's at least one paper that talks about organ damage in intermediate and high doses on rats, on 5-meo-mipt, the thing is that the drug was injected, and perhaps the first pass metabolism creates some non-that-toxic metabolites... who knows.

##### New Psychoactive Substance 5-MeO-MiPT In vivo Acute Toxicity and Hystotoxicological Study - PubMed

Low-dose 5-MeO-MiPT did not cause any serious histopathological effects on the liver, kidney, and brain. High doses induce apoptotic cell death through caspase activity.

Personally I wouldn't inject it nor use nasal route, even if we don't know how it works in humans sometimes I've had strange  and painful twinges in very specific points of the gut that I didn't like, as well as bloating at the end of the experience.

My gf had a very bad psychotic episode on moxy once, and she was taking anti-depressants and low dose antipsychotics (to sleep) by that time, so, anecdotally, I would say it's better to be "clear" of shit before using moxy.

I don't know, to be honest.  I only took it the one time at an active dose.  It was subtle yet kind of powerful.  I got the sense at a higher dose it could have really taken off, but I haven't gotten to revising it yet.  Hard to explain what it was like.  Definitely not in your face at all at the dose I took.  Pretty pleasurable, but also clearheaded.

The 4 subbed versions are more like simple dpt than any if the other 4 subbed tryptamines. 

I prefer snorting only this chemical as it has absolutely no burn at all but the effects are mild snorted compared to the same amount eaten. 

It requires a larger dose orally as well at least around 50mg and I've tried it up to 200mg orally but I do not reccomend such a dose.

Orally it produces strong muscle tremors and incredible visuals.

Nasally it's much lighter and provides very interesting closed eye visuals. 

Nasally it's more introspective and orally it's just like your along for the ride sort of like mushrooms are .

The 4aco version is more potent orally and produced no muscle tremors. 

The 4aco version is by far my all time favorite tryptamine....it's visually unlike anything else.

I felt a warm vibration and for a bit I felt like I was about to rise up out of my head.  I closed my eyes and saw the shadows trying to part, and in the music I felt and saw a structure build around me from the directional qualities of the sound recording.  At the same time, I could open my eyes and felt rather clearheaded and like I could probably deal with an unexpected situation.  It was subtle yet powerful.  It felt like it could become very powerful at maybe double the dose (I did I think 32mg or 36mg snorted, if I recall).  That's the best I can explain it.

I'm about to try vaping a small amount of this as a freebase green (blackish) oil.

It's impossible to weigh this goo so I'll start with a  match head size blob....will report back in a few hours.....hopefully it's fireworks!

A match head size drop onto a ceramic flavor disc produced nearly overwhelming effects.

I was able to.set my rig down and turn the lights off and stumble into bed.

Extremely powerful stuff.

Duration I'd say maim effects when.vaped around 20 mins though still feeling afterglow

Can you explain to me a couple things?

1-why the visuals are different than anything else? more OEVs or CEVs?

2- when you say it's more like DPT than any other 4subbed, you mean it's as eerie and sinister as DPT is normally said to be? it's the Aco version the same  in this aspect?


I don't know if the Aco version could bring "spirit abduction" moments which I'm not inclined to feel at the moment, just because it would be so similar to DPT. But well, never tried dpt, so I don't know how could affect me.

This is probably the absolute weirdest tryptamine in my opinion.

Snorted,  I've only ever experienced extremely complex closed eye visuals that seems extremely ordered.

Oral administration produces very DPT like open eye visuals but also much muscle tremors in the arms and legs.

I've never felt thst DPT had a darkness personally but if I had to compare the AcO ver vs the HO I'd say the AcO version is much much friendlier.  The HO version seems more serious and less forgiving orally.

I generally never snort any drugs ever but I make an exception for pretty much only this chemical on rare occasions because so far its the subjectively best ROA I've tried.

Ok, got it, thanks!

then I only have another question, 

How would you compare DPT oevs to 4-ho-mipt or DMT? because I don't have any idea about them, people usually say that are "powerful" and sometimes close to hallucinations but I've read a lot of different stuff, like entities or powerful colors like on bufotenine...

DPT is like DMT older more serious brother thst you could learn a lot from but who just might beat your ass if that makes any sense.

I really like DPT but it has a more serious tone to it than DMT.

The other 4 subs are uncomparable

I'd say 4acodmt is maybe closest to DMT.

And the same is true for tge DPT 4 subbed versions.

4ho/aco met is pretty different from met and 4aco/ho mipt is quite different from mipt. 

Probably has to do with symmetry.

I guess if DMT beats my ass if I take a big dose (breakthrough) then it would be dangerous for me to use something more "serious", I do consider DMT extremely serious, but maybe is because I judge it by it's spiritual undertone, more than anything else, I don't think it can be compared to other psychedelics (that I've done). If DPT is more serious because of it's spiritual undertone then I may be better far from it or analogues..

This actually seems to be a relatively more common risk with 5-methoxytryptamines compared to other common psychedelics. Despite having a reputation for being light (aside from 5-MeO-DMT), some people trip extremely hard on them and I've heard of psychotic reactions from both 5-MeO-MiPT and 5-MeO-DiPT. My most extreme episode ever was clearly triggered by 5-MeO-EiPT. Even people that smoke 5-MeO-DMT often talk about still "battling spirits" and such for weeks after. They're ridiculously powerful molecules that in my opinion should not be considered exactly the same as most other psychedelics, even the synthetic analogues that are often said to be more recreational.

4-HO-DPT is literally nothing like DMT as far as tryptamines go. In my experience it is extremely calm and smooth, in fact it's the only psychedelic I can clearly remember not having stimulation from on the comeup aside from DPT, and it's definitely lighter than DPT, although I find them superficially comparable. Honestly, I'm not sure introspection, adventure, or visuals are the right reason to go into it.... It's pretty unique. To me the thing that stands out the most about it is that at low dosages it feels like most of the psychedelic effects have been hollowed out compared to other tryptamines and it's just a euphoric and dissociating psychedelic high, but if you take a high enough dosage certain effects are still present, and those effects being really strong like normal yet separate from the other effects that usually come with high dosage tryptamines is part of what makes it so novel. I can be wandering around lost in thought feeling almost entirely unaltered, yet close my eyes and see very vivid, sexy, and intricate tryptamine-like closed eye visions, moving around very 3D perhaps more than on most 4-substituted tryptamines, but without too much overwhelming sensory overload or anything like that. If I do take enough to get geometric visuals, they also stand out as very unique from most other tryptamines, broad and darkly colored, but very pleasant to look at. I actually consider it one of the easiest tryptamines and it's not one of my favorites but it has given me some memorable experiences. I have known some people who really love it a lot.

If you want my advice, don't try to fathom DPT before you try it. You'll probably be wrong and a lot of people scare themselves off of it due to the reputation some have given it for being dark. In my amateur opinion and also some of other people I've known to use it much more than myself, it can actually be a much easier molecule to use than DMT, just don't go overboard with the dosing for your first time. It having a more serious tone doesn't make it a harder trip, it's really a nice psychedelic all together in most ways. Most people I know who use it find it incredibly blissful and I thought it was also one of the easiest psychedelics I've ever used, especially for its intensity.

Closer to 4-HO-MiPT than DMT but stronger. DPT's open eye visuals actually remind me of 4-HO-MPT's and they're something about it I really enjoy. Lots of trippy faces everywhere for me. (This is also similar to 4-HO-MET but with less of a plant vibe.) They're nowhere near as powerful as bufotenine's open eye visuals, but you can insert literally any other psychedelic there in the place of DPT and that will still be true for me.

If DPT is more serious because of it's spiritual undertone then I may be better far from it or analogues..

Honestly, DMT is miserable compared to most other psychedelics. It feels so sweaty and alien and uncompromising. On DPT the spirits are apprehensive of me, not the other way around. But really, don't think too much about it until you try it, that's my advice. Like, think about it enough to do it safely, but try not to expect much from the trip. Just start modestly with your dosing and it's really not that much of a deal.

Thanks for your message Kaleida, a lot to think of and to compare with. As you can imagine if one starts trying to know how a substance is, before the triangulation process the most common thing is to find contradicting reports, or at least reports that vary a lot. That's always the reason why I tend to test substance instead of just decide in a second-hand "no-thing", (but I like to ask, anyway).  

Some people say that DPT is very eerie and dark, some even say demonic. I didn't tell you, yet, about my DMT breakthrough and what happent the week/months later, I think, probably is in any of my messages of this forum, not sure, my memory is not the best. I wouldn't want at the moment anything like that since I'm in a complicated moment of my life where I need to be 100% awake and functional, cannot commit mistakes, for a while. That's why I thought, thinkin about those reports, that DPT could be not my thing. Maybe, I'll just give it time, and dose low.

Seems that Aco or Ho DPT could be much easier than DPT, then I would try, for some months I was away from psychedelics, that's an important thing to consider! I reconciled with psychs in my last low dose 4-ho-mipt trip.

Despite having a reputation for being light (aside from 5-MeO-DMT), some people trip extremely hard on them and I've heard of psychotic reactions from both 5-MeO-MiPT and 5-MeO-DiPT. My most extreme episode ever was clearly triggered by 5-MeO-EiPT. Even people that smoke 5-MeO-DMT often talk about still "battling spirits" and such for weeks after. They're ridiculously powerful molecules that in my opinion should not be considered exactly the same as most other psychedelics, even the synthetic analogues that are often said to be more recreational.

Now I think more or less the same, I was initially doubious about using it or not because of it's potency, I had bio-assayed once before sharing it, but I considered it to be... neutral or positive in terms of headspace, only with a somewhat sexy/perverted/"dark" undertone sometimes, but nothing really sinister. Then I discovered that it can cause a lot of wreck and I saw the most suffocating thought-loop ever, I didn't acted allright cause I found I didn't have proper tools at that moment, it was very difficult to manage, and I gave up when I thought the stuff was finishing (because I thought that we were clearly on the comedown), it was another mistake.. I felt guilty for quite a long time (she also made me feel that way) but was a big big learning for me (and probably for her too).

Strangely enough something similar happened to her during a 20mg ho-met trip months after that which I think it's not that normal...


It's remarkable that you called DMT miserable and uncompromising, never heard that words about it, but certainly it seems totally uncompromising. My feel there was that I was not invited there in anyway, that I didn't belong there and that they would like me to be a toy (even if they couldn't) to have fun in the cosmic spirit lands. Never had that feeling with other psychs but again, I think it's totally different from other psychs I've tried. Alien it's another appropiate word but that one is commonly heard about it... I'm not sure what that world is so I may go again, even having grown a lot of respect for it, I don't share the "it's our subconscious mind" hypothesis nor the biochemical reductionist point of view.

No problem, and I totally get that. I've just known a lot of people to scare themselves off of DPT without even trying it based on some of the reports so I try to warn people against doing so. Something else I think may get in the way of people getting a good picture of it is lots of the early reports used what I would now describe as ludicrously high dosages, like snorting over 100 mg and sometimes as high as 250 mg without even having any experience with it. 30 mg smoked was notably powerful and satisfying for me for my first time.

It can be dark, but like I said in the other thread it is comparable to 4-AcO-DET for me where the darkness is more about the theme of the trip, not the feeling. It is a very, very different vibe from DMT for me. DMT is like a terrifying heaven and DPT is like a soothing hell.


In my experience, base tryptamine trips in general do seem to have a tendency to stick with you after the fact, not as much as 5-methoxytryptamines but more so than 4-substituted tryptamines on average. I would probably recommend avoiding them for the moment if you don't want some trailing headspace.

I definitely think they're easier, and fairly easy in general (probably unless you take a huge dosage, anyway). I get why you bring up the break but that really doesn't give me much apprehension with 4-HO-DPT still. I'd be more afraid of the 4-HO-MiPT personally.

That definitely sounds rough, but I'm glad you learned from it. I once rather carelessly introduced someone else to psychedelic research chemicals as their first hallucinogens, and they quickly had an order of at least DPT and 5-MeO-MiPT and I want to say at least something else I forget now that they were going balls deep into on their own with almost no guidance from myself or anyone else. I didn't even learn that they had DPT until they said something to me like "Yeah, I got a gram of DPT but I railed that up pretty quickly, it was great." and I was like "I'm sorry, you did *what*?" One night he texted me out of the blue saying he took a huge dosage of 5-MeO-MiPT and was basically stuck in his first ever crazy thought loop and they had already been tripping for like ten hours with no signs of slowing down. I think it took them around fourteen to start moving beyond it, but it's been years now. I stayed on the line for as long as they needed help and they were good again after a while. It's definitely a much more powerful drug than it's given credit for, even if a lot of people manage to get away with a light trip for low dosages.

It's normal enough, especially for someone who trips hard on 5-MeO-MiPT. 4-HO-MET is another one whose reputation has started to over/undersell what it really is, because for years now it's been the go-to answer most times anyone asks "What's the psychedelic with the least headspace and the most visuals?" Which it's not necessarily the best answer for either by the way, but I think it's the one that fits that question that the most people have taken by this point, and relatively consistently does that for them.


4-HO-MET can definitely still throw people for a loop. I have a good friend who considers it and 4-AcO-MET to be about as powerful as any other mentally deep tryptamine and more than some for sure. We have discussed it at length and tend to agree that it is in some ways just different than something like psilocin, maybe sharing some of the qualities of things like DPT and 4-AcO-DET that we've mentioned here and elsewhere too, where its dreaminess somewhat belies the depths of its capacity to alter consciousness. I find it to be a lot like LSD in its headspace personally, which is generally still pretty controllable to me after it really sets in and I'd say 4-HO-MET is lighter than that still, but it's still a very heady trip for me, just one where I usually still know what's actually going on.

That is what they want, hyperspace entities are like that. Eternity gets boring.


Can't speak to whether or not they want you there. Mine actively tell me they want me to come so that they can play with me, but they didn't always. I've heard of people having many DMT breakthroughs and then suddenly being told to stay out and feeling like they couldn't do it again after that. So, if you feel like it's not the time to go in, maybe try again during another phase in life.

Nothing makes me feel exactly like DMT does and I've taken a lot of psychedelics at this point. There's something different about it for sure, although I'm not rating that difference as either better or worse.


My theories on the reality of these experiences are... unusual.
