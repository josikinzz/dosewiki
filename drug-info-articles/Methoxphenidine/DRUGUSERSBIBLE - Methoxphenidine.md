## Subjective Experience

First referenced in a 1989 patent, MXP appeared on the recreational markets at the
end of 2013, and became widely available during the following year.

My first experience with this chemical, a couple of years ago, was an early expedition
into this field. I was well immersed, I enjoyed it, and I recorded it as a solid ++ on the
Shulgin scale. However, other than its dissociative weirdness, and that I felt no ill
effects, I recall very little about it.

Fortunately, I still have one old MXP pill of 75mg left in a desk-drawer. A decision is
therefore required: what dose should I choose to re-sample with, given the threshold
data above?

After the allergy test, there is perhaps 70mg remaining. As I recall Internet reports
referring to seizures on high doses, there is an obvious need to proceed with more
caution than usual. Further, the BlueLight forum warns of unpredictability and
inconsistency, and suggests a starting dose of 50mg. I decide to heed this advice.

```
T+0:00 I break the pill into pieces, separate approximately 50mg, and bomb it
down the hatch with water. [2:45pm]
```
```
I dispose of the rest to prevent redosing under the influence.
```
```
T+0:30 Already I am feeling a sedated headspace, and I dreamily drift off
focus now and again. Whilst onset is commonly suggested to be 30-60
minutes, the odd report refers to two hours, which would put it on a par with
my experiments with ephenidine. However, this has started to take effect
much more quickly than anticipated.
```
```
T+0:45 I have now definitely entered the zone. Reality is a little weird, and a
degree of anaesthesia is present. I am warm and comfortable, feeling a mellow
headiness and physical insentience.
```
```
T+1:00 The headiness is pretty solid now, and quite pleasant. The physical
feeling is interesting in that there are occasional tactile sensations amidst the
overall numbing effect. Time is passing rather quickly. I am already enjoying
it.
```
```
T+1:15 As weirdness would have it a David Bowie track rolls in the
background with: “Please trip them gently, they don't like to fall, Oh by
jingo". I certainly feel that I am tripping gently at this stage, and floating.
```
```
T+1:30 The disconnection is now increasingly strong. I check my blood
pressure: 163/91. It’s quite high but not alarming. My pulse is a normal
53bpm. I am not happy about the former, but in the interest of not increasing
it further via stress, I choose to navigate my mind away from it rather than
dwell upon it.
```
```
I take the experience into a more relaxing realm by playing some YouTube
videos and reading.
```
```
T+1:45 Shock horror: a phone call! This takes me by surprise and I make the
mistake of picking up the handset. The real world interjects and I desperately
attempt to act like a normal human being. I engage a conversation to the best
of my ability with the lady on the other end, but with difficulty. I believe that I
am rational and lucid, but I am far from certain. I think the acronym I am
looking for here is OMG.
```
```
With this trauma over, I try to put it behind me and settle back down into the
experience.
```

```
T+2:00 I now feel that I have reached a plateau. The two hours have flown by.
Although I am still a little haunted by thoughts of the mess I made of that
phone call, I am in a fairly happy place.
```
```
I am a little chilly and my hands are cold, so there appears to be some
vasoconstriction in play.
```
```
T+2:30 I feel a little more grounded, and have probably peaked, but I am still
flying. There is a sense of wonder to everything as I float from one focus of
concentration to another.
```
```
T+2:45 I am coming-down. Physically I still have cold and clammy hands, but
mentally I am totally functional if I choose to be.
```
```
I can still ride the trip if I want to but step off it if I need to.
```
```
T+3:30 Time is still passing quickly. There is still some numbness and
headiness but I am in a much gentler state of dissociation.
```
```
I find that I can choose a subject or topic, focus, and then fall into it for a
period, before emerging back into self awareness.
```
```
I am now very much in control.
```
```
T+4:00 I seem to be winding down in the usual manner for a dissociative, but
even at this level, the headspace, body analgesia, and tingles, continue to make
this a gentle floating pleasure.
```
For the rest of the evening I drifted slowly but pleasantly down. Despite the bumps
on the road I felt physically well and was able to navigate my mind into positive
directions at will. The 50mg dose was clearly sufficient.

The night can best be described as comprising two deep sleeps of 3-4 hours each. The
first began with chilliness and the need for an extra cover, and ended with a vivid
nightmare. Theorising on the latter, I would speculate that, with the MXP still active
at a low level, the intensification of focus upon subject matter took me deeper into
the story of my dream than usual. This resulted in an extension of the dream beyond
the point at which I would have normally woken, with greater immersion within it. I
suspect that this phenomenon may also manifest across other dissociatives.

Notwithstanding the fact that generally I had a very good experience, research
demonstrates that this is a chemical which clearly carries risks. Erowid, for example,
reports that there have been several deaths associated with its use.

Dose moderation and appropriate caution is strongly advised.
