## Subjective Experience

Diphenidine began to appear on the markets in 2013, shortly after the UK ban on
ketamine came into effect. However, as it is much longer lasting and is usually taken
orally, it is not generally considered to be a direct replacement. The headspace
created is also reported to be notably different.

This chemical gave me my first experience of a dissociative, and this was certainly
not what I was anticipating. My expectation had been framed by the fact that the
aforementioned ketamine, which was the most well known dissociative, had been
widely reported by the media to be a horse tranquilliser. On the basis of this I naively
assumed that I would fall into a deep relaxing sedation, with significant drowsiness,
and perhaps, eventually, sleep.

I wasn’t even close.

The psychoactive effects took a significant time to materialise. Indeed, much longer
than almost any other compound I had experienced at the time. However, when they
emerged they were both immersive and distinctive.

My notes from the time were as follows:

```
When I am sat down, focusing upon something cerebral, I can lose myself
within the topic for lengthy periods, which is usually a very rewarding and
positive experience.
```
```
When I stand and walk around I am immediately aware of the disjointed
weirdness of the world which I now perceive. This initially invoked some fear,
but familiarity has tended to soften it.
```
```
Now that this adjustment has occurred, and I have reminded myself that this
is just a trip, and thus is a temporary phenomenon, it has become interesting
and intriguing. The feeling of general numbness adds to this aspect, in that
movement, the simple act of walking, feels more like a seamless floating
enterprise.
```
```
Overlaid on this, a feeling of general contentment has also taken hold and
anxieties have dissipated.
```
```
I can now see why dissociatives are such popular recreational drugs.
```
The overall experiment was both intriguing and enjoyable. I found diphenidine to be
multifaceted, in that on the dose I opted for I could solicit different aspects of the
experience almost at will.

On the flip side, it should be noted that there have been some reports of tragedy with
respect to the use of this drug, which were always in the back of my mind. It also felt
less smooth than its cousin, ephenidine, which I have subsequently sampled and
explored more frequently.

Diphenidine provided a very strange ride indeed, but with edges which caused
sufficient concern to prevent me from going too deep. Whilst I was under the
influence, those edges, perhaps jittery in nature, were very mild. In fact they could, at
least to some degree, have been invoked by familiarity with those reports, and by the
negative PR which this class of drug tended to attract from the media at the time. I
suspect that had ephenidine not emerged, I would have overcome them and used it
for more comprehensive exploration.

Playing exclusively in the shallow end, this was a good introduction to the world of
dissociatives. It was one from which I certainly derived a degree of insight and
pleasure. Research, however, indicates that it should always be approached with
care, and never binged.
