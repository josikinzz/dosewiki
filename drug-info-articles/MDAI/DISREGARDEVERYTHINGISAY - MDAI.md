**MDAI** (**5,6-Methylenedioxy-2-aminoindane**) is a drug developed in the 1990s by a team led by David E. Nichols at Purdue University. It acts as a non-neurotoxic and highly selective serotonin releasing agent (SSRA) which produces entactogen effects in humans similar to that of MDMA.

In terms of its chemistry, the chemical structure of MDAI is indirectly derived from that of the illicit drug MDA, but the alpha-methyl group of the alkylamino amphetamine side chain has been bound back to the benzene nucleus to form an indane ring system. This changes its pharmacological properties substantially.

In terms of its pharmacology, MDAI has been shown to inhibit the reuptake of serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine. This demonstrates that MDAI has selective affinity for the serotonin receptor. Studies show that the brains of animals treated with MDAI have greater extracellular concentrations of monoamine neural transmitters, most significantly serotonin. This result indicates that MDAI is a potent releaser of serotonin while effectively inhibiting the reuptake of serotonin. For comparison, MDAI is similar in potency with releasing serotonin to MDA but significantly less potent than MDMA.

The effects listed below are based upon the [subjective effects index](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effects_index) and personal experiences of [PsychonautWiki](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) contributors. The listed effects may rarely if ever occur all at once but heavier dosages will increase the chances and are more likely to induce a full range of effects.

**Physical Effects:**

The physical effects of MDAI can be broken down into seven components all of which progressively intensify proportional to dosage. These are described below and generally include:

- **[Euphoria](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_effects:_Euphoria)**
- [Enhancement of touch](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_effects:_Enhancement_of_touch)
- [Sedation](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_effects:_Sedation) - The biggest difference between MDAI and MDMA is that due to a comparative lack of dopamine reuptake inhibition, MDAI primarily results in moderate sedation and therefore discourages physical activities such as running, dancing or climbing.
- [Spontaneous tactile sensations](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_effects:_Spontaneous_tactile_sensations) - The “body high” of MDAI can be described as a moderate to extreme euphoric, soft and warm tingling sensation that encompasses the entire body. It is capable of becoming overwhelmingly pleasurable at higher dosages. This sensation maintains a consistent presence that steadily rises with the onset and hits its limit once the peak has been reached.
- [Dehydration](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_effects:_Dehydration) - Feelings of dry mouth and dehydration are a universal experience with MDAI; this effect is a product of an increased heart rate and an extreme motivation to engage in strenuous physical activities. While it is important to avoid becoming dehydrated, especially when out dancing in a hot environment, there have been a number of users suffering from water intoxication through over-drinking so it is advised that users simply sip at water and never over-drink.
- [Vibrating vision](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Vibrating_vision) - At high dosages, a person’s eyeballs may even begin to spontaneously wiggle back and forth in a rapid motion, causing the vision to become blurry and temporarily out of focus– a condition known as nystagmus.

**Cognitive Effects:**

The cognitive effects of MDAI can be broken down into four components all of which progressively intensify proportional to dosage. The general head space of MDAI is described by many as one of euphoria and feelings of love or empathy. It contains a number of typical entactogenic cognitive effects.

The most prominent of these cognitive effects generally include:

- **[Euphoria](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_effects:_Euphoria)** - Strong emotional euphoria and feelings of happiness are present within MDAI and are a direct result of serotonin and dopamine release.
- [Increased empathy, love and sociability](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_effects:_Increased_empathy,_love_and_sociability) - This particular effect is equally as pronounced, powerful and therapeutic as that of MDMA or 2C-B. It is the most obvious and noticeable effect within any MDAI experience and dominates the head space.
- [Acceleration of thought](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_effects:_Acceleration_of_thought)
- [Mindfulness](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_effects:_Mindfulness)

**Visual effects:**

The visual effects of MDAI only occur at higher dosages and are subtly psychedelic. These generally include:

- [Increased visual acuity](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Increased_visual_acuity)
- [Enhancement of colour](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Enhancement_of_colour)
- [Tracers](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Tracers)

**Physical Health Effects, Potential Addiction and Tolerance:**

MDAI and other similar drugs have been widely used in scientific research, as they are able to replicate many of the effects of MDMA but without causing the neurotoxicity which may be associated with MDMA and some related drugs. No tests have been performed on cardiovascular toxicity.

There is currently no scientific data on the lethal dosage of MDAI within human beings but it is thought to be high in comparison to its active dosage. Due to its action as a serotonin reuptake inhibitor, overdoses of this substance would likely result in acute or even fatal serotonin syndrome.

The tolerance to MDAI builds up with repeated usage in much the same way that MDMA does. There does not seem to be any addictive potential but long term usage could potentially lead onto it.

**Legal issues:**

MDAI is currently a legal grey area world wide and freely available through the use of online research chemical vendors. This does not mean that you are guaranteed to be immune from legal prosecution should you be found in possession of this substance as it is likely to vary from country to country.

**Conclusion:**

In conclusion, MDAI is an extremely interesting alternative to MDMA due to its lack of neurotoxic effects and minimal dopamine reuptake inhibition. I would suggest this compound to anybody who wishes to experience the profound therapeutic entactogenic effects of MDMA without the stimulation or neurotoxicity. I would recommend the use of 5-HTP serotonin supplements the day after heavy MDAI usage to further mitigate its unlikely adverse effects .
