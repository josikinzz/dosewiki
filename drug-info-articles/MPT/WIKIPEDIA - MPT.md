Methylpropyltryptamine (MPT), also known as N-methyl-N-propyltryptamine, is a psychedelic drug of the tryptamine family. It is a homologue of methylethyltryptamine (MET).

## Use and effects

In his book TiHKAL (Tryptamines I Have Known and Loved), Alexander Shulgin described MPT's effects as being unknown and its dose as being greater than 50 mg orally.

## Interactions

## Chemistry

### Detection

An analytical method for MPT's detection has been reported.

### Crystal structure

In 2019, Chadeayne et al. published the crystal structure of MPT. The authors describe the structure as "...a single molecule in the asymmetric unit, with an indole group that demonstrates a mean deviation from planarity of 0.015 A°."

### Analogues

Analogues of MPT include 4-HO-MPT, 5-MeO-MPT, methylethyltryptamine (MET), ethylpropyltryptamine (EPT), ethylisopropyltryptamine (EiPT), and dipropyltryptamine (DPT), among others.
