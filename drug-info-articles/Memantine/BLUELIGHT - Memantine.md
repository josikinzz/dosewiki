There is an alzheimer's drug called memantine that is, like ketamine, an NMDA antagonist. It can also be used to treat pain/as an anaesthetic. It has PCP-like qualities (also like ketamine). It is a very safe drug, however, and it is in fact neuroprotective and neuroregenerative -- a benefit over ketamine.

Memantine can be used to potentiate a number of drugs and prevent (or even reverse) alcohol, cocaine, opiate, and amphetamine tolerance.

Has anyone tried this? Or does anyone know anyone who has? Any information would be much appreciated.

A FOAF said "It's like k but better." Can anyone confirm or negate this?

fairnymph - I won't insult you by saying what I came up with in a Google search, since I know you're quite bright enough to do that.

But, the one interesting tid-bit that I found, that may be of interest as a starting point.

[http://www.signalsmag.com/signalsmag.nsf/0/CABA763046A9542588256BC7005C6CA4](http://www.signalsmag.com/signalsmag.nsf/0/CABA763046A9542588256BC7005C6CA4)

Memantine just received marketing clearance in the European Union for treating Alzheimer's disease. For what other indication is it approved?

ANSWER: Memantine, an oral NMDA receptor antagonist, has been marketed in Germany as a treatment for dementia since 1989 by Merz Pharma KgaA. Neurobiological Technologies Inc., which signed a collaboration and marketing alliance with Merz in April 1998, will receive a $1.4 million payment for the most recent approval. 

So, I suppose you *might* be able to find it in an overseas drug store/pharmacy.  Big *might* that though.  Good luck  ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Sounds interesting.

Hmm.

BTW Ketamine DOES have neuroprotective qualities.

Don't know about neuroregenerative though.

Interesting that a search at erowid yeilded this:


> The effects of the kava extract and its constituents were compared with those produced by the typical anticonvulsant, memantine. The kava extract, methysticin and dihydromethysticin produced effects similar to those of the reference substance memantine. The kava extract (150 mg/kg, 1 h before ischemia) diminished the infarct area (P less than 0.05) in mouse brains and the infarct volume (P less than 0.05) in rat brains. Methysticin, dihydromethysticin (both 10 and 30 mg/kg, 15 min before ischemia) and memantine (20 mg/kg, 30 min before ischemia) significantly reduced the infarct area in mouse brains. All other compounds failed to produce a beneficial effect on the infarct area in mouse brains. In conclusion, the kava extract exhibited neuroprotective activity, which was probably mediated by its constituents methysticin and dihydromethysticin.

Remix, I don't think the ketamine had anything to do with you not feeling bad after a night of ecstasy.

My friends and I used to use both drugs together on a regular basis.  I don't recall ever feeling any less crappy the next day.

Also, while ketamine has some neuroprotective qualities, it may still have somewhat harmful effects at the same time.  People who use ketamine on a regular basis sometimes complain of lowered cognitive ability or memory problems.  It's very possible that ketamine may help just one area of the brain while causing slight harm to another part.  Or then again, any problems related to ketamine may be entirely psychological.

And I definantly would not rely on ketamine to prevent damage from ecstasy.  There is a big difference between reducing neurotoxic effects and completely preventing neurotoxic effects.

remix: It is possible that it was just circumstancial. Also, no matter how neuroprotective something is, I would assume one would feel like crap after a night a clubbing/partying, with or without chemicals.

Found this interesting article about memantine 


[http://amphetamines.com/methamphetamine/methmemantine.html](http://amphetamines.com/methamphetamine/methmemantine.html) 


the findings indicated that the memantine-methamphetamine combination produced novel discriminative stimulus effects and that memantine produced some stimulant-like subjective effects. 


Hmm wonder what would be a suitable dose for first time consumption... any ideas anyone ? they seem to come in 10mg tablets...

Through the years 1996-1999, my friends and I would often consume ecstasy with bumps of ketamine to grams of ketamine.  Not to mention just about everyone who went to raves on the east coast of the United States as far as I'm aware of, and likely for a much longer period of time and all over the globe, not simply a section of the United States.


No my friend, ketamine is not going to protect you from any damage caused by MDMA.  You and your girlfriend just had a good night and were lucky that you didn't feel crappy the next day.


Ketamine is absolutely NOT going to make you feel any less crappy if you're sensitive to ecstasy and normally feel like a wreck the next day.  Infact, it will probably make you feel worse because it's just one more thing your body has to deal with.

DXM has nueroprotective and reverse tolerance propietys as well so its not like its a big deal it just has a reverse tolerance effect to other drugs.

Right, right .. I realized I erred a while later, but alas, a warning had already shown up in my inbox.


Anyway, what I should have said was:


If you are interested in ordering this chemical, search google for it. Several european websites will allow you to order it without a prescription. From one supplier, *********, the price is 190 euros for 50 10mg tablets. Reasonable for research purposes, I guess. 


This chemical is also listed in "this is your brain on dissociatives" under the prescription dissociative  heading. 


if anybody orders this chemical, i would be very interested in seeing a FAQ with relative recreational doses etc.

K was at first supposed to be neuroprotective, etc. but that was sort of ruled out by willy white, if you believe him. I think he has a few good points.


I would be suprised if a K analog could compare to the amazingly weird K hole. Ya cant beat K! dont even give me that dxm crap, haha.

CC, I am not kidding but to tell the truth, I have just begun larger research into ketamine. I have on and off researched it for years, but since I got a bottle recently I read the William White stuff... and he is a scientist or researcher unlike any of us (i assume). It seems like everyone is in denial that dissociatives will harm the brain. They may not, but I think theres a good chance they do.


Those assumptions are supposedly through research in animals and some in humans. Haven't you ever heard of DXM messing up people that abuse it? And I knew someone personally that used to do K all the time, he has schitzophrenia and other problems now.


I think there is no completely safe dissociative. When I do K, i take vitamin C and a small pinch of xanax to go with it, just in case willy is right. Couldn't hurt. Moderation is one of the keys to safe drug use too, whether it is K or this stuff I just heard of,Memantine.


Well I am off to IM 80mg of K. If anything interesting happens I'll write up a TR.

I believe there is a good chance too, but I also believe WW's shit, namely "this is your brain on dissociatives", is garbage.

Yes. DXM is not ketamine.

Are you implying that the schizophrenia was caused directly by ketamine? I do not believe that. Indirectly, maybe. Any psychedelic drug has the potential to bring out pre-exsisting psychological problems.

Sirs i dont mean to be snooty but could we please get back on topic? 


I agree with fairnymph, someone needs to try this stuff and report back, ITS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO THE BL COMMUNITY, KTHX.

No, all NMDA-antagonists have neuroprotective properties.

---

No.  Dr. Olney established that NMDA-antagonists can cause a specific form of neuronal injury at specific doses in rodents.  This does not alter the fact that they also have neuroprotective properties at other doses.

You assume incorrectly.

---

How can we be in denial about something we don't have adequate information to make pronouncements about one way or another?  It used to be maintained that LSD HAD to cause brain damage, both because of the intensity of the experience, and long-term personality changes observed in users.

---

*Personally*, I **suspect** that moderate users of dissociatives have a better chance of dying in traffic than of developing Olney's Lesions.

---

Rodents.  Thus far, these lesions have not been demonstrated to occur in primates.

---

---

No credible evidence of the existence of permanent brain damage in humans seems to exist at the moment.

I've heard of LSD and pot messing up people that abuse them.

I know someone personally who dipped tobacco and who killed himself.  Therefore, I conclude that dipping tobacco causes you to kill yourself.

There are no completely safe drugs, nor completely safe experiences, for that matter.

The Xanax most likely further impairs memory of the experience.

Ah, Cliff, this is certainly off-topic but I love to see your biting posts here. They have a certain William White and RFG aggression to them. 


The "innocent until proven guilty" approach to dissociatives, DXM especially, is a dangerous one. While we have only anecdotal evidence to show lasting impairment, and you seem to have escaped this impairment, these peoples' experiences have merit by mere virtue of being the only data available.


> Haven't you ever heard of DXM messing up people that abuse it?


Yes, there are acid burnouts. Yes, there are marijuana burnouts. I think it should be fair to say though, that never before have tarded teenagers appeared in the numbers they do with DXM. Of course, none of this can be proven, only related on internet forums. I wish I had been logging my life before I used DXM (but the trip report format started my journaling days). I wish I could have taken a before and after snapshot of the FIRST USE. It *screamed* BRAIN DAMAGE. Danger, Will Robinson, danger. 


Alas, it seems like certain people are immune to permafry (like you), if not many or perhaps even most. But those that aren't feel it hard.

>How much of this stuff would be needed for a recreational dosage????


The point, n2ofiend, is that this is not known. Ordering this drug from a european supplier with some pooled money ;-) [mod note: sarcasm] is perhaps the only way to find out. entrez-pubmed says nothing of memantine overdose.

I think that Olney actually does make some very important points when we look at his body of work - I find it hard to see how a scientifically rationale individual can dismiss all of his contributions to the study of this facinating molecule with such simple blanket statements.


I have stated this before but we really need to make sure that we are properly defining the term "neuroprotective" before we start throwing it around and applying it to any molecules.  The complicated dance that is played out by our neurochemistry cannot be accurately addressed in such one dimentional terms.  It is quite possible for a molecule to be both neuroprotective by one mechanism and neurotoxic by another, depending upon what parameters we chose to measure and over what period of time.  If a study is only looking at one endpoint, then we are getting a very limited snapshot of what is actually going on.


I am glad to see that others are seeing through the "innocent until proven guilty" mindset, as it is a very dangerous one.  We can sit here all day and throw around theories as to why a molecule might be harmful, theraputic or neutral but the bottom line is that we are not even close to having all the answers.  We need to see a lot more work done in this area, especialy looking at long term chronic administration before we start making statements about safety.  Doing so beforehand represents a leap of faith over what could be described a very deep and dark abyss.  


I personally reserve such leaps of faith for matters of religion, not science.

I completely agree with this,  look at basic things like pseudoephedrine- it surpresses breathing but raises your heart rate because it affects the soft tissue of the lungs and the heart muscle completely different.  I'm sure the govn't will market it, a lot .. like phen phen (ex) then realise its not the miracle drug it was intended to be.

This doesn't relate to the "recreational" use of memantine but may be pertinent none the less. From today's UK Guardian:

_______________________________________

Adverts for Alzheimer's drug 'are misleading'


 A pharmaceutical company is accused of making false promotional claims for its drug for Alzheimer's disease, by stating in its adverts that patients who take it may avoid the need for nursing care. 


Lundbeck, the manufacturer of the drug memantine, which is sold under the brand name Ebixa, should retract the claim made in its medical journal advertisements, says the Consumers' Association publication Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin, published today.  


The Bulletin says there is no scientific evidence to prove that patients with Alzheimer's put on the drug will be able to live independently for longer.  


"On published evidence, memantine produces, at best, only a small reduction in the rate of deterioration in global, functional and cognitive scales in such patients," it says.

I never advocated an 'innocent until proven guilty' approach.  Regardless of whether or not dissociatives cause permanent brain damage, they can cause nasty cognitive impairments for many people if abused, and to my mind these should not be disregarded simply because they are reversible deficits (funnily enough, my paper on Erowid that I linked to takes the same position).  The overhwelming majority of dissociative users do not seem to develop any permanent problems related to their dissociative use.  That's about the best statement of safety I can make.  Beyond that, abusing dissociatives can fuck you the fuck up.  Best to exercise caution - and I don't recall ever advocating that anyone do otherwise.

All of whose contributions?  The only dismissive comments that I can find in my post concern the so-called 'research' of William White.

---

---

Which molecule?  PCP?  Ketamine?  MK-801?

---

> with such simple blanket statements.

---

My 'blanket statements' concern only the poorly argued, poorly conceived alarmism practiced by William White.  Dr. Olney's research is perfectly relevant in discussing the effects of NMDA antagonists on rodents, and may or may not be applicable to primates - though thus far, efforts to produce these lesions in primates have not been successful.  I don't find that position to be dismissive of Dr. Olney's research, nor do I think that being dismissive of inaccurate statements concerning a  drug's dangers is equivalent to stating that said drug is 'safe' to be constantly abused.  Whether or not dissociatives cause permanent brain damage, abusing them definitely has a nasty set of side-effects.

Namaste,

Cliff

Somehow it delays the effects of Alziemers by boosting cognitive ability and memory skills I think. Oh ya, it's also in a tablet. ![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif)  Far as that, I don't know yet about any abuse potential.

Sounds like good stuff.  Too bad I'll probably never get around to trying it myself.


Evaluation of the reinforcing and discriminative stimulus properties of the low-affinity N-methyl-D-aspartate channel blocker memantine.


Nicholson KL, Jones HE, Balster RL.


Memantine (MEM) is currently in clinical use in Europe for the treatment of various neurological disorders. It is a low-affinity channel blocker of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors whose voltage-dependent, rapid binding kinetics are believed to limit its phencyclidine (PCP)-like side effects. MEM, and its analog amantadine (AMA), which has also been demonstrated to have some NMDA antagonist activity, were evaluated for PCP-like behavioral effects. The discriminative stimulus properties of MEM and AMA were tested in monkeys and rats trained to discriminate PCP from saline using a standard two-lever drug discrimination paradigm under a fixed ratio (FR) schedule of food reinforcement. In rats, MEM resulted in a dose-dependent substitution for PCP; however, full substitution occurred only at response rate suppressing doses. AMA failed to substitute for PCP at any dose tested. For MEM, all four monkeys showed complete substitution for PCP at doses which did not greatly decrease rates of responding. Conversely, AMA occasioned little or no responding on the PCP-associated level in any of the subjects. Intravenous self-administration of MEM and AMA was tested under a FR schedule of reinforcement in four monkeys trained to lever press for infusions of PCP. MEM served as a reinforcer in all subjects at one or more doses tested. For two of the subjects, at least one dose of AMA maintained rates of self-administration above those for saline. For both MEM and AMA, maximal response rates were considerably lower than with PCP self-administration and both drugs were much less potent in monkeys than would be predicted from rodent studies. The data show that MEM shares discriminative stimulus effects with PCP under these testing conditions, whereas the chemically similar compound AMA does not. MEM also serves as a positive reinforcer in rhesus monkeys, whereas AMA can serve as a weak reinforcer in only some subjects. Both AMA and MEM are reported to function as NMDA antagonists, yet clear differences exist in their behavioral effects with MEM acting more like a PCP-like antagonist. In addition, despite the rapid channel kinetics of MEM's NMDA receptor blockade, it may have some PCP-like abuse potential in humans at doses above the normal therapeutic levels.

Yes, the FDA has already approved for its use in America roughly a week ago.

**memantine**


Don't know if anyone still reads this, but I have taken high doses of memantine.


Anyone curious? It takes quite an attention span to write.,

We are all very curious!!!


Also, besides its effects at high doses, I would like to know if there is any confirmation of its anti-tolerance building effects when taken with opiates.

If anyone can PM me a link and if the price is not too high, I'll order some as soon as I leave home (Jan. 15). I would definetly need some RELIABLE dosages though, I don't wanna end up wasting half of it by trying little (safe) bumps before realising the dosage is the same as for Ketamine.


I would definetly want a statue somewhere on this site though

**reply**


I haven't had any personal experiences using memantine to prevent opiate-tolerance, but it's likely this would be so.


Rather, I used it to attempt to prevent tolerance to amphetamines. This was unsucessful, but I did have a tolerance before I tried memantine, and not after. I think it will work when my tolerance is finally gone.


Anyways, on high doses of memantine, I noted these effects:


Frequent: Increased Strength, Dissasociation, Odd Thought Patterns- sometimes they sound brilliant, but many times they feel as though they're an anxiety reponse- again, I was on amphetamine, which is a sort of counfounding factor.


Not as frequent: Acute psychosis, out of body experiences- I think music sounded strange to me- as though it were data for me to analyze.


Overall, an unpleasant and unproductive experience. 


I believe there may be action at other receptor sights which mediate the rewarding properties you're no doubt searching for.

..so how much did you take exactly during your 'high' doses.??.which route of ingestion..???..


..also how long after you started taking the amphetamine before you dosed with the memantine?..i ask this because i have personally long since sworn off taking psychedelics/dissacociatives after being up for a few days on meth (which i have sworn off anywayz)...i have had many bad , horrible, or at least completly bizzare uncomfortable wierdo trips using this combo..and i rarely have bad trips, so i wonder how the meth may have affected your experience with it..


..again i (and i believe i speak for many others) would be 'very' interested in hearing anything more about experiences with this substance..i find it funny that on the manufactuers insert, they say there shouldn't be any problems if you take too much, yet they also specifically say not to take in combination with ketamine/dxm, ect...and hallucinations were reported with a small percentage of the research group at medicinal doses..


..i dunno, from what i understand this drug has more potential for treating the symptoms of this disiese than anything else on the market..perhaps that is why the fda, ect, have overlooked the fact that it is so closely related to other more commonly used items in the psychedelic underground..i mean dxm is a cough suppresant like no other ya know...and commonly available...


..also have you tried ketamine or other similar drugs, and how do you think the overall feel of the memantine experience compared to them..i mean you describe OBE's, dissasociation, music sounding wierd, ect so i gotta ask..


..also interested in the receptor site comment..could play a role...will check your link..hmmm...more..anything..MORE..!!!

ok wow a great link..a freakin goldmine of info when one searches for 'memantine'..i don't understand half of it, and i wasn't able to find the specific page you mentioned about it acting on other receptors and such, but i found something i thought some here might find interesting, if not possibly a bit dissapointing..


..it gives a quick overview of how earlier nmda antagonists (i assume these are the ones we are most familiar with) had potential in treatment, but had too many psychomimetic 'side effects', but how the new breed of nmda-antagonists including memantine have less 'side effects', while still providing the potential for treating these diseases in the brain..almost like they breeded a low-morphine producing poppy that still has good tasting seed..and i assume this abstract is descibing commonly prescribed doses, so lower levels may provide 'their' benificial effects, but that doesnt mean higher levels won't potentaily provide 'ours'..heh..anywayz, a little perspective..


[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov:80/entr...t_uids=14619404&dopt=Abstract&itool=iconabstr](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov:80/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=14619404&dopt=Abstract&itool=iconabstr)


The initial promise of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists gave hope for the therapeutic treatment of neurological disorders, which ultimately was unfulfilled. In many cases, their adverse psychotomimetic effects were too severe for them to be used therapeutically in the way that most had envisaged. The last decade has seen significant progress in our understanding of the NMDA receptor complex and the site(s) of action of various uncompetitive antagonists. In particular, this has led to the development of a family of low-affinity, uncompetitive, cation channel antagonists that seem to offer many of the benefits of the older channel blockers but with a more acceptable side effect profile. Drugs such as memantine have demonstrated beneficial effects in clinical trials for Alzheimer's disease and ischemia, with few adverse side effects. These, and other new experimental agents, are demonstrating that it may yet be possible to tap the enormous potential of NMDA receptor antagonists as therapeutic drugs, without necessarily incurring the adverse side effects associated with the first generation compounds.

> It has the same binding site like magnesium, but it has a higher affinity. Therefore it blocks the Ca2+ influx by NMDA activation when a pathologically high dose of glutamate is released, but when there's a lower concentration of glutamate, memantine can't bind to the channel and allows the normal ion influx, so it doesn't disrupt so aggressively the NMDA dependent neurotransmission like non-competitive antagonists (ketamine).

**atara EDIT: In order to maintain the usefulness of adamantane-based antiviral drugs, it is critical that adamantane not be used recreationally. If you are interested in the adamantane dissociatives, please, stick to memantine!**


In my on-going efforts to spread the divine word about sacred Dissociative Anaesthetics, I decided to start this thread on a somewhat atypical and litte-known class of non-selective NMDA-antagonists. 


To my knowledge, there is only a single trip report on Amantadine in existence (its on BL, search) and it is an apparent overdose (2-3g when a regular dose is 100mg!!). The effects from that report along sound to me like a cross between DXM and datura, which actually makes perfect sense since Amantadine, besides being an NMDA antagonist, also has some (weak?) anticholinergic action. Other than that, I think I read a few breif reports here and there reporting feeling hte dopaminergic mood-lift of the drug when taking it for its indicated use (as anti-viral).


I have finally managed to acquire a box of Amantadine. An hour ago I just popped a single 100mg pill just to test for atypical reactions, normal reactions, and the like. It not out of question that it will be influenced by the 30mg temazepam I took 3 hours before it. Still though, I am used enough to benzos and NMDA antagonists to see how well they each meet and greet. And so far? I will say this - I feel a very wonderful but mild mood-lift and sharpening of my senses/thinking (I would say it feel more like Nicotine than anything else!), whereas my current benzo taper has been making me depressed, grumpy, and of course very stupid. 


I'll be experimenting more with Amantadine later for sure, perhaps at slightly higher doses, and report back. I am crossing my fingers  that it will be a good mood-stabelizer *a la* my low-dose K regimens. 


I will also not lie to you: I will be trying Nitrous (tonight?) and (later) Ketamine while I'm on it ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


I'll keep reporting back!

As for Memantine, I have yet to experience it myself due to its rediculously high prices, but there are a couple of reports here that seem to make it out as something very interesting...

I really do appreciate your concern, my friend, and I definitely will be careful.


If it is of ny comfort to you, my personal aim with Amantadine is medicinal, not recreational. It is therefore unlikely that I will be going much higher than the medicinal dose.


To update, now 4 hours later the same feeling seems to be maintained. Its a definite feeling atributable to the drug, not to anything else. It it, for the most part, dopaminergic. I feel surprisingly refreshed and motivated for someone who has relapsed to benzo addiction and is just starting to kick it. I had a little nap, and had the most vivid, lucid dreams I have ever had, to the point of thinking I actually woke up and went to watch TV with my uncle and have conversations, only to really wake up and rmember that my uncle lives two continents away! Mind you these were not hallucinations, I was aware that they were dreams.


I would like to remind, though, that there is no "buzz" to speak of... only something like having smoked a hookah with the nmda-antagonist "signature" on it.


Swilly: Good question. I will look into that. My intuition says no, though.

**Update:**


Fuck, this is really nice!!


I really, really, really, **REALLY** hope that these are simply the normal effects of the drug and not a synergy between it and the benzos. Beause if so, this IS doing what I was hoping it would do: I feel VERY stable mood-wise, no anxiety, and most importantly: I have motivation to make my life better and the confidence to do so. This is what I use Ketamine in low doses for. I also get the bonus of being protected against certain viruses ![:p](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)


PLEASE PLEASE let this be the normal effect of amantadine. It would suck if this is just a first-trial thing, or if it is a synergy, or worse: if it comes at a horrible side-effect price....


After this initial trial (the drug has a long, long half-life), I will do my best to taper the benzos down as quickly as possible (this was a small relapse, so it shouldn't be difficult). I will not take amantadine any more for a while (especially that I have a few other things waiting to be tried ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)), and then come back to it on its own and see if it produces the same effect.... wish me luck, everyone ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

So is it my understanding that you've gotten these effects from 100mg alone, before the introduction of ketamine and/or nitrous? Or was that just a dip in the pool to gauge the temperature, as it were. I must admit this is quite intrigueing, I've long been a proponant of the motivational/spiritual headspace the traditional dissociatives are capable of producing, although the most readily available have long since been exhausted of their capacity for such (for me).


I can't wait until I hear back from you on your second trial run, as it seems this chemical is readily available without prescription. 


Good luck to you friend.

^I have a street near my house where someone, for gods knows what reason, wrote in big white spray paint "Tiletamine Corner"....it always makes me laugh, why on earth did someone write that??? ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) I moved in about 8 months ago and it was a brilliant discovery. Unfortuantely, everytime I drive around a corner now, I think the word tiletamine- I don't even know anything about the drug either. Thats my tale.


edit: I have found low dose anticholinergics to be relaxing and actually claryfying, which is unexpected. They don't dumb me down at all, just allow space for thoughrs to actually form. Higher doses- well.....make sure you don't take too much Jammy and amp up the anticholine aspect. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

^ That is interesting, about anticholinergics. I suppose that is why Hydroxyzine is prescribed for anxiety. 


I don't think I'll ever take higher than the medicinal doses for amantadine. Memantine, I might try going higher, since it seems to carry less risk.


2C: This was amantadine alone (well, and my daily regimen of benzos). No Nitrous or Ketamine.


It seems to be waning this morning but it still feels the same: like having smoked a nice bowl of Tobacco in a hookah, only lasting a day and a half. 


I will note that I did have trouble sleeping, although this could be because I had a cup of coffee in the evening. However, when I eventually did, I had the most vivid dreams one can have. And generally I rarely remember my dreams (especially with a benzo habit).

^ You might be absolutely right, but one thing is absolute true: it has nothing to do with this thread.


Update, according to [this site](http://www.mentalhealth.com/drug/p30-s05.html), Amantadine's cholinergic effects are not present in medicinal doses:

Interesting that you said it felt like nicotine AND smoking tobacco and the vivid dreams, reminds of when I used to try to quit cigarettes with nicotine transdermal patches; crazy crazy KRAZY dreams.

Yeah, Nicotine patches (I use them occasionally as non-addictive stims - non-smoker here) do indeed give crazy dreams...


So today i took the same dose as yesterday but took both 100mg pills at the same time. No difference was noted, and in fact the effects were less pronounced, leading me to believe that yesterday's excitement was indeed just a cherry-popping thing. I still felt a mild dopaminergic effect, but I did experience some mood swings (then again, K's mood-stabelizing effect takes a few days to start working). One interesting thing is its synergy with benzos... it seems to weaken their overall effect, but just like with yesterday, when I took my daily dose of temazepam, I just lay there and had the WEIRDEST dreams ever.


I am going to reconfirm insomnia - and this is in fact one of its reported side-effects. This is requiring me to take large doses of benzos and even alcohol and thereby interfering with my tapering.


So i decided to pull the plugs on this one until my body is relatively back to normal. I might give it one more trial tomorrow (if for nothing, then for trying it with N2O ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)), but that would be the last of it for now. I will post a conclusion tomorrow about this first trial with a new NMDA antagonist. 


However, I do feel what samadhi is feeling. This drug seems to have a strange vibe to it - I'm not talking about the effects themselves, just the drug in general. I would think I would be slightly more comfortable experimenting with Memantine...

I must absolutely stress so people don't waste thier money that Amantadine is NOT a dissociative, in my appearant "OD" there were absolutely no noticable NMDA FX whatsoever, no dopamine FX either, just antichlorogenic visuals and nausea NRG zapped from me.


In animal studies memantine but NOT amantadine substituted for PCP in rats.

is amantadine cholinergic or anticholinergic?  Cholinergic actions would certainly be consistent with crazy dreams, because during REM sleep the ascending monoaminergic projections are shut down but there is lots of cholinergic activity.

I've never tried Amantadine

and I've not yet sampled Tiletamine,

I hadn't even *heard* of Memantine

but I sure do like me some Ketamine!

I would say thats true.


My last dose was 300 mg the day after the last day reported (2 days ago) and I personally found it useless as a mood-stabeliser. It certainly is not dissociative, even though it has the same "signature" that things like low-dose DXM or high-dose cat's claw have.


That aside, I found amantadine to actually **WEAKEN** nitrous oxide!!!


It also seems to fuck up my reaction to Ketamine... the day after use (it was still in my system I assume) my tolerance to Ketamine was very unusually high, and the ketamine itself felt more like PCP (more schizo, less ataxia, more useless).


Bottom line is: I have stopped taking Amantadine and my opinion on it right now is that it is worthless. This doesn't mean that this is the end, its just that it isn't something I am interested in anymore.


Memantine is next on the list ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I heard that it increases energy, unlike datura.....maybe you took too much and you didnt get the target ratio for its intended medicinal effects?


Amantadine is also anti-viral, so if you have an undiagnosed virus sapping your energy, there is a chance this could help fight it....not all anti-virals work for every virus though.


Memantine might actually have more risk in some demographics.


For somebody who isnt taking it for anxiety or mood elevation, would you say that it increased energy levels at all? Better than Provigil?

I saw some studies that report some benefit for cocaine withdrawal. I'm surly totally wrong but can amantadine ease the stim comedown? Like MDPV or MDXX stuf?


Whow and I saw that amantadine is a IMAO B! Reversible or irreversible? That sound really dangerous...

What a coincidence, I was looking on Wikipedia today which NMDA antagonist I didnt know, and Amantadine, and more importantly, Memantine, were the only on the list that I didnt know. I did some local search without any hope, and the drug its marketed by a lot of brands here, and more importantly, its list 4, so I am sure I will try it very soon... I just wonder why the hell its so damn expensive no matter the brand (Roemmers, Bago, Ivax, Gador, etc)...

Almost all products comes in 10/15mg Memantine per 15 or 30 pills/capsules...


But yeah, reports in Erowid shows clearly this drug could be very dangerous, 'tweaking' your head for a lot of time [http://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=52958](http://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=52958) ["Nearly Neverending Trip"]


Also, does this research means that Memantine does *something* at the MU opiote receptors? [http://www.nature.com/npp/journal/v31/n1/full/1300760a.html](http://www.nature.com/npp/journal/v31/n1/full/1300760a.html)


Sorry, this is the last edit:

"Memantine is also being tested for generalized anxiety disorder, epilepsy, opioid dependence, systemic lupus erythematosus, depression, obsessive compulsive disorder, Tourette Syndrome, problem gambling, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD),[7] glaucoma, tinnitus, neuropathic pain including Complex Regional Pain Syndrome,[8] pervasive developmental disorders, HIV associated dementia,[9] nystagmus,[10] multiple sclerosis[11] and autism.[12]" [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memantine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memantine)


I really want to try this thing.

Amantadine seems to be very dangerous chemical. An average "recreational" dose is aroun 1.5 g. 1.0 g may be enough to feel the effects, 2.0 can be too much, if you're sensitive to this drug, and 3.0 g is definitely an overdose. 


A typical amantadine trip is structured into two phases, dissociation part and delirium part. Visual hallucinations are deliriant-like, and are mostly experienced during the second phase.

Amantadine is quite "dark", produces no euphoria, and can last up to 24 hours. However, there are people who enjoy it.


The most problem with amantadine is "hangover" after-effects. Depending on dose, number of trips and individual sensitivity, they can include: depression, panic attacks, muscle tremors(definitely not a good sign), and other mental "disorders".


Sorry for such a messy description, I'm not speaking from my own experience. I wouldn't touch this drug with a ten foot pole.

**tolerance TO memantine**


so i used it at 10mg for 2 weeks to reduce my benzo withdrawals (medical, i had them prescribed).


they did a good job, but now i'm left with about 10 x 10 mg memantine pills. i haven't taken them in about 6 days.


at 10 mg i definitely felt a nice psychedelic touch upon the 3rd day, after which a tolerance developed to it, but still wondering if maybe i could get a nice trip off of 40 mg seeing as some bluelighters have already tried higher doses with some people liking them and others saying it's too strange of a trip.

**Memantine**


Memantine is a long-lasting NMDA antagonist sold as a prescription drug for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and has a common therapeutic dose of 10 mg. It is also a 5HT3 antagonist and a D2 agonist.  Further, it reportedly lowers tolerance to amphetamines and opiates. I recently tried a 110 mg recreational dose of memantine and experienced pleasant euphoric/dissociative/psychedelic effects. Though I could still feel the effects the next day, they were substantially reduced and did not impair me so much as to prevent conducting common undemanding chores, which seems to indicate memantine's long duration does not necessarily disqualify it for recreational use. It's D2 agonism did not cause any negative effects for me at this dose. I posted [my experience](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/306985-More-about-Memantine?p=11747306&viewfull=1#post11747306) in the More About Memantine thread in Other Drugs Discussion. 


The only memantine thread I could find in Psychedelic Drugs ended in 2003 and is archived. Being a dissociative, it's my understanding it should have its own thread in PD. Perhaps the other threads could be merged with this one to get discussion going here? I believe it has significant recreational potential, especially if, as has been suggested, the duration can be reduced by acidifying one's urine to speed elimination.

Whoops, didn't see this thread when I made my memantine thread here in PD earlier. Memantine is a long-lasting NMDA antagonist sold as a prescription drug for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and has a common therapeutic dose of 10 mg. It is also a 5HT3 antagonist and a D2 agonist. Further, it reportedly lowers tolerance to amphetamines and opiates. I recently tried a 110 mg recreational dose of memantine and experienced pleasant euphoric/dissociative/psychedelic effects. Though I could still feel the effects the next day, they were substantially reduced and did not impair me so much as to prevent conducting common undemanding chores, which seems to indicate memantine's long duration does not necessarily disqualify it for recreational use. It's D2 agonism did not cause any negative effects for me at this dose. I posted the following earlier in the Other Drugs thread "More About Memantine":


> 110 mg oral feels good. The NMDA antagonism I'm sensing is comparable to about 250 mg DXM (oral) or 30 mg ketamine (IM) or 15 mg MXE (IR). Prior to this, I've used memantine at 50 mg, and 70 mg, both in combination with other drugs. With both of those earlier doses taken during the early afternoon the effects were worn off (subjectively) after I woke up the next day. I'm not experiencing any undesirable effects from its D2 agonism, and might be feeling a bit more stout than usual due to its 5HT3 antagonism. The only NMDA antagonists I've used in the past two and half weeks are memantine and one dose of 150 mg DXM (to see its effects with memantine [it had the predicted linear increase]). It's likely that I have a lingering tolerance to MXE that's playing a mitigating role in the intensity and duration of memantines' effects on me, though I don't think the tolerance is very strong. I'm curious as to whether 150 or 200 mg doses could cause proper dissociative effects to begin, but I don't want to risk spending (potentially) 48 hours in a "mant-hole" to find out. That said, at 110 mg I have a pleasant buzz and feel motivated to communicate. I've just added gabapentin and kratom to the mix and suspect I'm coming up on a warm, contented evening.

> Things started to get down right trippy last night after I smoked some high grade cannabis (not much either). I had also used 1600mg gabapentin and 5 grams of maeng da kratom, but I think the kratom had mostly subsided when the trippy effects began. I was surprised to be getting fairly intense closed eye visuals. Perhaps they were attributable to the D2 agonism? I know D2 antagonists are used as antipsychotics but I wasn't having thoughts any crazier than is normal for the amount of disassociation I was feeling. This morning I still felt lingering dissociative effects, though they were greatly reduced (I'd say comparable to 100 mg DXM). It'll be awhile before I use memantine again, but next time I think I'll devote a whole day to it and take 160 mg early on a Saturday morning. The psychedelia I was experiencing was really intriguing, just unexpected. It felt funny having a goofy gabapentin buzz alongside it. I may also use some urinary tract infection medication to acidify my urine as that is supposed to help shorten the duration of memantine. It definitely seems like I could have a proper dissociative trip off it at 160 mg, perhaps with a little bump from MXE.
> 		
> Click to expand...


A few days after this experience I took 70 mg along with small doses of 2-FA and MXE. I've done MXE with 2-FA quite a few times and never experienced anything like the effects I experienced with memantine. It also possessed significant experiential overlap with the memantine/cannabis/gabapentin/kratom combo, so I attribute the effects mostly to memantine, though 70 mg is not that high of a dose so I suspect the contribution of MXE to the overall intensity. 


About 3 hours after dosing I began to feel extremely engaged with and passionate about everything I was experiencing. This did not feel very much like MXE mania, though it did seem like a sort of mania (perhaps attributable to the D2 agonism?). In addition to the sheer verve of the effects it felt "groovy," in what I imagine the original sense of that term was: a guiding experience that runs deep. Waves arrived with a pervasive, almost shudder inducing, satisfaction akin to that a deep breath during a yawn can bring, so much so I found myself literally gulping at the air at times. I ended up going out for a cigarette (not common) with my headphones on at four in the damn morning and dancing in my back yard like like a man possessed (also not common behavior for me). So, thumbs up from me. I'm going to give 150-170 mgs a shot eventually, maybe along with urinary tract infection meds to acidify my urine to hopefully shorten the duration, but since I still need to plan for at least 24 hours of not being able to drive it may be awhile.

Yes, I've read those reports. To my mind, the two issues keeping memantine from becoming a great recreational dissociative are its price and duration of action. The first can be addressed by shopping around overseas pharmacies, and the second, theoretically, can be mitigated through the use of methionine, which is cheap and readily available to any online consumers and may be available at convenience stores, and will hopefully help memantiners piss out their product post haste.  I advise the plucky consumer and would-be memantine recreationist to try out their dose early on a Saturday morning, so they have a lazy Sunday to use for whatever should things not work out as theorized.

I have seen this but am a bit surprised you truly found it that nice, I remember hearing another user or two on another forum disliking it while simply using it for tolerance aversion, though the guy was kind of a weirdo.... Could you describe it a little bit more, such as what sort of dissociative it felt most similar to? Fairly interested in this.

^Yes, I like it a lot. It's not a "holing" sort of dissociative, though I imagine it could be -- I just wouldn't want to be in a state like that for 10 plus hours or who knows how long? It's hard for me to say since combinations were involved but when I was coming up on the 110 mg there was nothing else in my system and of all the dissociatives I've tried (DXM, K, 3-MeO-PCP, 3-ho-PCP, 4-MeO-PCP, nitrous) I suppose it most resembled a plus two dose of 4-MeO-PCP. Other reports have likened it to ketamine, but who know what their points of reference are? It's an NMDA antagonist, so it has that characteristic staticy, "engaging the world from inside a big tin can" sort of vibe, but then it has D2 agonism, which I'm guessing is behind the driving, "makes you say oohh" and thrust your pelvis out sort of revved up feeling. Plus it has 5HT3 antagonism, which has unknown influences and potential synergistic effects, though given 5HT3's associations I think the effects of antagonism at the receptor are likely to be pleasurable or at least anxiolytic and stabilizing.  It's definitely an atypical dissociative, and clearly its lengthy nature is not ideal. You're committing to at least 24 hours of being functionally dissociated and in takes three hours to plateau, so K-tards hoping for "mant holes" should probably stumble on and search elsewhere. For me it's looking more like something that lays the groundwork for a long weekend of debauchery, or, at lower doses, a motivational disinhibiting stimulatory kind of drug. I do find the buzz quite pleasurable, though, that's for sure.

Ha, that was my thought as well. Does it seem like a good one to lay the groundwork with? Such as taking a lower to medium dose of this to get a dissociative glow going then consuming something more powerful like MXE/K for a hole type experience. With the anatogism at 5HT3 how do you think it would effect psychedelics(I can't remember which ones touch this...)?

Yes, for me, the 100 mg dosage range lands me in auspicious grounds, a highly manageable psychological landscape fit for launching in pretty much any direction. It's a feeling of being comfortably engaged and raring to go, so in that respect it's a choice combo drug. Still, I'm intrigued by the notion of taking higher doses of it on its own because it has such a vivacious character for me. There's a hum to it, like everywhere I go buried power lines lend a little bounce to my gait.

I'm also interested in this. Neramexane still hasn't been released, though -- not that it couldn't be obtained by other means. A cursory glance at some abstracts indicates it's a stronger nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist than memantine and that 40 mg oral is considered a "weak" dose, which *seemingly* doesn't make it seem all that much stronger than memantine. I'm curious to know any figures comparing its efficacy as an NMDA antagonist to memantine, as well as any data on half-life so we can maybe guess at duration. I didn't see anything about it being a D2 agonist or a 5HT3 antagonist like memantine (again I didn't look for long) though, so if it doesn't act on these I'm not sure it makes sense to think of it as more qualitatively powerful than memantine, as such would ostensibly just make it a structurally related but presumably subjectively different drug.


Also: I was stuck with a spontaneous gut-feeling to give it a shot, and 40 mg 6-APDB intramuscularly injected on top of 90 mg memantine/kratom/low MXE resulted in a profoundly affecting mystical state for me last night. It was highly fascinating. Most drug induced ecstatic states for me are orgasm-like, with sharp increases in autonomic arousal, heavy breathing, increased heart rate, sobbing from overwhelming beauty and gratitude for mere existence etc. -- very much like a spirtual-aesthetic version of what I imagine the emotional component of the female orgasm to be like -- but this could not have been a calmer experience. It was strange: a radical qualatative shift toward extreme contentment and acceptance with powerful euphoria that almost induced sleep! It gave the subjective impression of even having slightly reduced body temperature, which was very odd.  


I have A LOT of experience with extreme euphoric states of different shades and I've never felt anything quite like this. This was a psychelic experience that was wrapped up with notions of being "outside" of life smiling back at myself and being completely confident about death and at ease with my mortality. For about an hour afterward I kept considering listening to music or posting here, but I couldn't be bothered to do anything but pace around in silence in awe of what happened -- I was simply too satisfied. One previous IM 6-APDB experience with the same dose in combination with MXE did not produce anything like this, more just the expected stimulated empathogenic euphoria. This experience seemed to be influenced by memantine, as it felt like a crumbling of defenses at that same deep-chord-plucking soul-string vibratory level as memantine. I'm out of both memantine and 6-APDB, but if I can replicate anything even close to this it would be worth serious further therapeutic investigation. Also, recent MXE use leading up to the 90 mg of memantine seemed to caused cross-tolerance that reduced the expected intensity of memantine relative to what I felt earlier from 110 mg memantine following an extended MXE break.

^I wouldn't downplay the 6-APDB, its caused a very similar state for me. Only high dose mescaline provided such a mixture of feeling absolutely estatic, a strong feeling of empathy, and a true feeling of oneness/extremely serene calm. I also felt the similarly about mortality and was able to let go of much that night leading me to the verge of tears as well . Very interesting to hear about the experience as well as Neramexane!

I finally tried that 160mg dose of memantine I recommended earlier. I hadn't used any dissassociatives for two weeks, which is usually enough time to make a noticeable difference for me with MXE, though I'm certain continuing cross tolerance played a mitigating role in my experience.  


As usual, I began to feel memantine's effects within 30 minutes after dosing, though it took a full 3 hours for those effects to plateau. It's hard to say for sure since I haven't used more familiar dissociatives around the time to establish a reference point, but my impression from this 160 mg dose and doses previous is that memantine is a qualitatively unique dissociative.  For me, its effects are focused in the head more than any others', providing a spacey, far-removed, "helium head" kind of buzz rather than the fuzzy, noodle legged anesthetic body effects characteristic of ketamine, nitrous, or the early stages of MXE intoxication. I'm certainly impaired, occasionally loosing the train of a conversation for instance, but even at this high dose I feel little in the way of anesthesia or mania. I have to conclude that the sense of extreme "engagement" and those moments of wild lust for life I alluded to earlier during past memantine experiences were a product of the memantine/MXE combo. I have a lot of MXE experience, so I'm certain that what I described was contributed to by both drugs rather than mistakenly being representative of, for instance, just an especially manic MXE trip that occurred coincidentally. 


While I wasn't dancing outside in my underwear during this trip, I still certainly felt good. There was a stabilizing quality to the feeling. I've not been diagnosed, nor do I suspect I suffer from, any psychiatric disorder, so I don't mean "stabilizing" as it might be understood in such a sense. I mean that the attitude of detached contentment towards one's own life that is characteristic of many different dissociatives is a particularly prominent quality of memantine for me. More, this stable temperament persisted after smoking cannabis, a drug whose effects typically override this quality when I combine it with other dissociatives.     


Though I was still plateaued 12 hours after ingestion, I found sleep easy with the aid of 50 mg of diphenhydramine and a stiff drink. I awoke with the same pleasant and self-assured feeling that has stayed with me to this night: an extremely prolonged pleasant dissociative afterglow that is only impairing to any common task if I give myself over to it. I assume this resilience to memantine's lengthy effects owes mostly to cross tolerance rather than fast metabolism, since others have described sincere doubts about their motor abilities well over 24 hours after initially dosing despite having taken far less than me. MXE or another dissociative (and probably a strong tryptamine) will likely figure into my next memantine excursion, though I may give 200mg a shot on its own before I include anything else just to make sure I'm not missing anything dramatic. Though I was never "carried away" by the effects of 160mg, I remain a big fan of the substance.

Interesting that you would find memantine at all recreational. I used 100mg of the stuff and the best way I could describe it was "DXM lite" - even at 20mg, I got that weird feeling that DXM gives you that you have a medicine head and you feel like you're swollen (best way I can describe it, like your body feels larger than it actually is) but I stopped messing with it when I started getting respiratory depression from it. I probably am the "weirdo" that Help?!?! is referring to ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)

 Maybe a combinaison of methionine and piracetam can be usefull to be free of residual dissociative side effects the next day?


Magicalkat, did you have benzos on your system when you felt cardiac effects from memantine? Maybe that's just some potentialisation of accumulated benzos metabolites which slow down your heart?


Oh, I have a last question. Can memantine be plugged?

The cardiac effects I'm speaking of thikal were the result of mixing memantine with a dopaminergic stimulant although I have no idea what the problem was with 4-HO-MET. I did a few combos and all of them were harsher than without the memantine - the one that surprised me the most was the MDMA. I mean this MDMA was amazing. Some of my individual rocks weighed over 3 grams before I crushed them and they were only slightly tinted green when they were whole but when ground, they went completely translucent white. There's no way there was some impurity in there that would have stimulated me to the point that my resting was 160. I only did a 150mg bomb of the stuff anyway. I suppose there is something to be said for tolerance though.


And yeah, I had Valium in my system throughout - I have to take it BID.


As for plugging, I never tried it, but if you can get around the binders I don't see why not. It is the hydrochloride salt and is highly water soluble.

It also has some cardiac properties when mixed with some substances so be careful. I had a negative reaction with known-good MDMA (meaning I had consumed those same moon rocks from the same batch and it was in a cobalt vial in a wooden chest that was closed in my closet like the rest of my chems) that ended up giving me a significantly elevated pulse (160 if I remember correctly). I also had a similar cardiac event with 4-HO-MET which never had caused any sort of bodyload to me before - I ended up having to abort that experience with Klonopin which didn't work after 3mg so I went to alcohol as a last resort.

I found it recreational on its own, though not spectacularly so. As discussed earlier, I think where it really shines is in combos and, potentially, as a psychiatric therapy. It's strange about the perceived respiratory depression and MDMA contraindicative symptoms. Respiratory depression was not reported in clinical trials so far as I know and it's not contraindicated with anything. I used it with 6-APDB and experienced no negative reactions. The cardiac symptoms don't appear to be commonly reported, either. We are talking about a medication used mostly with Alzheimer's patients, so I expect some worrisome symptoms to be reported that probably aren't too much of a concern for the typical recreational user (still, good of you to note).

Yes, I imagine that combo would go far in reducing next day effects -- the first helps eliminate it from the body more quickly and the second has been reported anecdotally to reduce the effects of ketamine. I expect work rectally, though as MagicalKat mentions there's all those pill binders (I imagine 11+ undissolved pill remnants might be annoying sitting there, though as long as they were crushed it might increase the potency).

More importantly, Amantadine is an antiviral! Misuse of antimicrobial drugs contributes to resistance, and nothing says "misuse of antimicrobials" like taking antivirals recreationally to get high. Influenza is already largely resistant to amantadine, but it is still useful to treat other viral infections, including [rabies!](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&ved=0CCsQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FMilwaukee_protocol&ei=ZoZtUqiwE5SgkQfsyYCQAQ&usg=AFQjCNFva9X7CrbzDgbLraemj2tK6XQHuQ&bvm=bv.55123115,d.eW0)


Using amantadine recreationally isn't just putting yourself at risk from the chemical. **Recreational use of amantadine helps to degrade the usefulness of an extremely valuable medical tool, and potentially causes harm to everyone.**


The upshot: please, please, *please,* do not use amantadine recreationally! Memantine, which seems to lack antiviral activity at recreational doses, is fine.

Well bradycardia and tachycardia have both been reported for memantine alone just not commonly.


The perceived breathing issues could be related to anxiety for sure but on another board that is no longer around, I wasn't the only one to report breathing issues with it. Like DXM, it made me stop smoking as well so it could have been the "freeze" effect on the cilia from recent smoking cessation. There are lots of plausible explanations that would be completely unrelated to the drug just like anything else though for sure.


EDIT: Yeah, I would never touch amantadine. Interesting that it is useful with rabies - I didn't realize they had anything that was useful for rabies!


The fact that she maintained most of her cognitive functioning sounds promising too - I wonder how much of that had to do with the amantadine.

I mixed memantine without problem with GBL, MDPV, Noctran, methylone, cocaine free base, and other stuff I don't remember without any bad cardiac feeling. But that's just anecdotal... Thanks for the answer. (And for the plugging thing, I read that memantine isn't really soluble in water for injection in a thread on bluelight, but It don't say that it can't be absorbed in the rectum so I have to try ehehe, maybe usefull road for lessen the duration a little bit)

I used mematine again, this time at 140mg with repeated 15 mg doses of methoxetamine, and I can confirm that once again the deeply satisfying effects I was raving about earlier were thoroughly the effects of the combination and not predominately of MXE alone. I watched an anime called RahXephon: The Motion Picture, which was about as much fun as I can imagine having watching a movie. Some critics complained they were lost because too much of the story was cut in making the film, which was adapted from a series I've not seen, but I understood what was being talked about the whole time. It had a lot of lofty concepts and dialog, so I can understand why some might get lost, but despite the fact that the combo does cause some cognitive impairment it didn't seem to matter when it came to following fantastical ideas. The next day I was still slightly dissociated and went to the gym to do handball practice for cardio. This involves smacking a small blue ball off the walls,floor, and ceiling of a racquetball court with a cupped palm and letting it bounce as few times as possible before hitting it against the front wall again. I've never hit the ball so effortlessly and consistently! In appearance, the way I was playing is to handball as the "Drunken Master" of kung-fu is to martial arts. It was so easy to stagger around and know right where the ball was going to be. The phrase "loose goose beast mode" popped into my head spontaneously to describe it, which made me laugh. The whole day comprised the afterglow, which was more satisfying than any I've ever had before.

I remember having some interest in Memantine a while back, but I'm not sure if I totally understand its effect. I've recently seen it pop up on a couple of nootropics vendor sites, and am curious what possible effects this could have as typically NMDA receptor antagonists strike me as the antithesis of nootropics. Maybe it's just another case of a supplement which is not necessarily a nootropic but just a novel chemical being vended onto these websites, but the fact that it has possible recreational effects make me wary. 


I have extensively experimented with other dissociatives, but this one seems very peculiar, at least pharmacologically-speaking. Have any of you guys tried Memantine in a typical prescription dosing regimen, and if so, would you say you received any benefits from it, either short or long-term?

^ It is wonderful at 40mg a day for tolerance issues but it has a head fog associated with it the first week or so you use it that reminds you of coming up on DXM but it never goes anywhere.


It also makes alcohol into a wonderfully euphoric experience and cuts your tolerance for it to zero, eliminating the hangover because the body has to process much less alcohol. 


It adds something to any combo but not always in a good way.


I found it to be interesting but with its long half-life, I'd be really cautious with the dose. It is completely irresponsible to sell it as a bulk nootropic. The literature that came with it warned about psychoactivity at high doses and said not to mix it with DXM and ketamine.

If they're selling it as a nootropic that's a hell of a stretch. It's shown "modest" improvement as a treatment for Alzheimer's disease ... so yeah, I assume from that they're thinking it must be a smart drug? I don't think Bluelight is the place to look for people taking memantine as prescribed. Not many Alzheimer's patients here. What I find interesting about it is its combination of NMDA antagonism with 5HT3 antagonism. I've previously stumbled across profoundly euphoric effects combining high dose ondansetron, a selective 5HT3 antagonist, with DXM -- though limited tests in others showed this reaction to be idiocyncratic, even if it was still reactive in other ways. So to find another drug with this shared mechanism of action that puts me in a similarly fantastic mood when combined with MXE, and to have now repeated it, is interesting. Memantine has other pharmacological effects as well of course, but, yes, still very interesting ...

Thanks for the input, guys. Sorry, by "prescribed dosing regimen", I just meant something like 10mg twice daily or 20mg once daily as opposed to larger recreational dosages. I would agree that any nootropic qualities it may possess would be a hell of a stretch - sort of like how Phenibut appears on many nootropics vendor sites while it doesn't appear to have any cognitive or memory-enhancing qualities. I guess what I was getting at was that Memantine sounds interesting to me, but based on this thread, it is hard to tell whether it is useful as a recreational drug or as some sort of supplement. I'll probably get around to trying it out one of these days when I have some extra money.

I recently used memantine at 110 mgs with 135 mg DXM (pure powder) and 13 mg of 3-Meo-PCP. The effects further confirmed my earlier interpretation of the phenomenal MXE/memantine combination as owing substantially to memantine. While not quite as great as the earlier MXE/memantine combinations, this most recent experience had a similarly satisfying, deeply grooved euphoria, like an eye-rolling back scratch for the psyche. At some point I'll have to try it with ketamine.

Wonder why it's here in PD. I took mematine for tolerance (wasn't helpful) to adderall and used it with dxm to have a confusing day. Think it's garbage.

It is an NMDA antagonist like dissociative drugs (e.g. DXM / ketamine / MXE), if that wasn't obvious already it does explain the simplistic pharmacological rationale behind why Jamshyd probaby posted it here in PD. And why it got centralized instead of moved. 

But I'm not sure in what regard people confirmed that high-dose amantadine or memantine experiences can be similar as far as psychedelic dissociative potential goes...


I still wonder about it and probably would have tried it if I was still in my experimental phase. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

^I certainly wasn't claiming it was comparable to more common recreational dissociatives at a high dose but I did mean to communicate that in my experience it adds an extraordinarily satisfying and motivational dimension not just to MXE but to 3-MeO-PCP as well (though the effect is not as pronounced as with MXE). I don't think it's "garbage" on its own by any stretch, just that its real value for me as a recreational substance and potential therapeutic agent is in combination -- though I could see it maybe functioning as an effective anti-depressant at lower doses with little risk of abuse potential compared to other NMDA antagonists that might be explored for such a role.

I don't know, it says right in the literature that comes with Admenta (Sun Pharma India brand memantine) that an overdose had no lasting effects but had a psychotomimetic response. They don't say much about it but I can certainly see higher doses of memantine being more like traditional NMDA antagonists. Even at 60mg, it "feels" like you have taken DXM but has no actual psychotomimetic response, just a weird body feeling that hints at it. 


That said, I would be cautious escalating the doses to higher ranges because of its propensity to cause problems with respiration.

I'm guessing the psychotomimetic response to high doses has something to do with its D2 agonism, as many older antipsychotics are non-selective D2 *anta*gonists. I personally didn't feel anything like that at 160 mg by itself. The enhancing effects of memantine in combination with MXE or 3-MeO-PCP I've experienced could be described as a sort of mania, certainly, but it wasn't the sort of racing, on the verge of being difficult to wield, sort of manic thoughts I've experienced with MXE on a few rare occasions when I could've imagined such effects leading to problematic behaviors. The sort of manic enhancement I'm referring to with memantine is of the kind that makes me want to say "*yes*, this is great! ... can't put my finger on it but I just feel so *in and responsive to* everything good happening right now, ya know man?!!" heh heh. It's not a feeling of being almost out of control so much as it is a sense of emphatic engagement, though admittedly it's not difficult to imagine such a state leading to various kinds of delusional conclusions. Though for me personally, I don't see these kinds of levels realistically being reached until taking ridiculously high dosages that I have absolutely no inclination to experiment with. I see little personal benefit in exercising  those kinds of psychological limits, particularly not with a compound that has as lengthy a metabolic half-life as memantine's!   


I don't know that memantine has a "propensity" to cause respiratory problems outside of your limited experience.

ive had memantine around 10 times b4


it is not very recreational, but i was young and hated myself and wanted to get out of my skin so having an altered perception and being able to obsess over random topics for hours was vaguely interesting to me


its not that fun though or euphoric or nice imo


ive had up to 150mg and it is kind of like dxm but a bit worse, its hard to describe, its been a long while since i had it


i dont recommend though... try it once if you are still into it after doing your research


its nothing like K or mxe

Can you tell a little more about your experience? 


I think it can cause anti-nootropic effects with acute dosing as it's an alpha-7 nAChR antagonist, but with repeated doses the alpha-7 nACh receptors upregulate and the brain fog dissipates. So maybe the right way to try this drug is to consume small doses (5-10mg) over a week and then have a higher dose for recreation (e.g. 50-100mg). 


Also, it could make a great combination with psychedelics and stimulants to reduce the excitotoxicity and to add a hint of dissociation.

Heres my erowid experiance report that got accepted : ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png) It was a bright summer day and it started with me and two of my friends having stayed up late the night before we woke up at about 12:00 noon and we had already planned on going swimming. Before my friends got up so around 11:30 I did a small 10mg line of MXE and was buzzed but not intoxicated off of that.

I find it pleasant on its own, but it's definetely an atypical dissociative. I've used it up to 160 mg. It adds a whole different dimension to MXE or 3-MeO-PCP, which I personally find to be a big improvement in both cases, though I like each of those on their own as well. I may give it one more shot but up it to 200 mg at some point, but I think it's really much more intriguing in combinations than by itself. Others have reported low to moderate recreational value on its own relative to most other dissociatives, and I mostly agree, but after four separate combo sessions I think it's my favorite dissociative to mix with others in the same class, and that's taking account of a wide range of dissociative experience, including ketamine, DXM, 3-MeO-PCP, 3-ho-PCP, 4-MeO-PCP, MXE, and nitrous. Use it early on in the day or make sure you have no conflicts on your schedule the next.


My experiences are in the latter parts of the [Big & Dandy Amantadine and Memantine thread](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/364671-Big-amp-Dandy-Amantadine-and-Memantine-thread/page3).

I've tried Memantine before, in the past, and found it moderately recreational on its own. My first experience with memantine was quite pleasant. I consumed 100mg and meditated for a number of hours in bed, feeling euphoric and peaceful. The effects reminded me of DXM but had a guiding force that was somewhat reminiscent of Ketamine (which I feel is lacking in the DXM experience).


I feel that memantine can give a hole experience if the dosing is high enough, at least I'm hopeful. A 4-6 hour hole would be simply divine!


I'm expecting to use nicotine in order to mitigate any of the effects the nACH antagonism might have on the experience. Plus, nothing beats a hit of nicotine while on a dissociative.


One thing I'm interested in is the combination of Memantine with tryptamines. From doing some reading, it would seem that it does not have any negative interaction with MAOI's. This would mean that it **might** even be safe to combine with pharmahuasca! That would be a unique experience, no nausea, a deeper psychedelic experience, one can only imagine.

^I'm glad someone else found it enjoyable on its own, too. How high of a dose are you thinking to attempt a memantine "hole"? I'd think at least 200 mg for the non-tolerant person would be needed, but hope you'd try 150 mg or less first. [Here's](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/095281809090078H) an interesting case from a medical journal regarding ketamine and MAOIs:


> A 42-year-old woman taking tranylcypromine, a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor, was hypovolemic.from a ruptured ectopic pregnancy and required an emergency laparotomy. Anesthetic induction with ketamine, an agent with sympathomimetic properties, was used because o f her hypovolemia, despite theoretical concerns of precipitating an adrenergic crisis. The patient's hemodynamic course remained unchanged with induction and incubation, and with further fluid and blood administration, satisfactory hemodynamic conditions were obtained. This report is believed to be the first to describe the use of ketamine in a patient taking MAO inhibitors.

These concerns about precipitating an adrenergic crisis are why I've never attempted to combine dissociatives with ayahuasca, though like you I think it could be an experience beyond imagining. I have combined synthetic DMT with ketamine during a ketamine/synthetic psilocin trip before. I posted about it way back when but it was easy to find in the archives using Google:


> From the hour that follows I can take nothing. In some ways it has been the most phenomenal experience of my life, yet it is without memories or insights. I learn nothing and can’t accept that that is so. I decide I will endure the doubt again--wherein all self-reference and control has evaporated and I can hope for nothing but that these rhythms of my body will at some distant time carry me back to myself--before I will accept that. As soon as I am minimally able to I prepare ~40mg of DMT and another 25mg of ketamine for injection. I hope that by approaching the experience from a different perceptual angle I can see SOMETHING.
> 
> 
> 
> It begins promisingly. The largely involuntary idiomotor movements don’t seem to be coming back, perhaps I can maintain perspective if my body is not in the thrall of the experience. Then, in the course of a few seconds, I’m gripped in the coils of the DMT-steel-constrictor, its brilliant razor scales shredding me into bloody rivers of sensation, each following its own torturous course forever away from understanding or any bearing of coherent perception. Something behind my face melts, gurgles, and runs down my throat. A few centimeters above my head I feel the impossible tactile sensations of tiny explosions of hot sand. The particles rain down onto my face and into my eyes where they are rapidly absorbed and can be felt pumping through my veins. I ask myself to describe it, to peak my head above the surface of this process for just a second so I can look down at its water and know that that is why I’m wet. But I can’t get beyond the textures of the experience itself. The manifold lenses of my working memory have collapsed into a single frame that magnifies this one channel of experience to the exclusion of all others. It’s the same intractable situation I was in during the trip an hour ago. And in my despair the same vision I had then recurs now:
> 
>

> I see and feel myself sitting cross-legged in a shallow pool, my own viscera spilled out of my body, draping onto my legs through my fingers. I am frantically inspecting my digestive system, searching for something to eat. I recognize what I’m being mercifully shown, and consequently the futility of my pursuit to understand what’s been happening. The vision has a purpose, its subconscious designer has an imbued it with an undeniable wisdom, and I can trust from that wisdom that at some consciously impenetrable level my experience has been comprehended, and that I am complete.
> 		
> Click to expand...
... it was quite an experience. Still, I find ayahuasca far more immersing than synthetic DMT taken orally with an MAOI or synthetic DMT intramuscularly injected on its own. I'm not sure what it is (I typically use harmala and MHRB), but ayahuasca involves these thrilling "surges" while synthetic DMT has always been a steady, albeit still intense, sort of experience. For this reason I've always wanted to try a dissociative with ayahuasca, but I'm nevertheless very hesitant to mix anything with an MAOI but trytamines I've read previous reports about. If you do it I'd say you should start small and do successively larger doses of the MAOI taken after memantine over many many sessions until you reach the doses of MAOI needed to make pharmahuasca work. Unfortunately, due to the length of memantine such a process may take a very long time before you can try the combination, but you must agree it beats potentially dieing horribly, heh. 


I also plan on combining memantine with tryptamines, though for me it will likely involve the addition of ketamine, DXM, or maybe MXE. I have a couple nicotine patches I was planning to use for inducing intense dream states, so I'll have to cut off a slice for memantine sometime. Interesting idea.

Dose will be 300mg, I'm very tolerant to dissociatives and I'm hoping this dose will give me a deep experience. Ketamine has long ago lost its luster, and MXE simply doesn't consistently give the depth that I crave. It's a shame that there is no easy way to reverse dissociative tolerance...


I've combined memantine with other dissociatives before, MXE and 3-MeO-PCP, but found it only added a degree of unsettling confusion.


Just waiting for the right time to take this journey, which should be 01/08. I'll be back to report around then.


An edit before my near approaching journey.


A week ago I did a tester dose of 170mg. This was different, I'm in a much healthier space now than I was in the past when I had tried this substance. The effects were very unique, much more like DXM but very lucid. I watched a few movies and thoughts swirled around my head. Memories, feelings, emotions of times past all intermingled with the viewing experience. I was more engaged watching a simplistic action-adventure film than I've been watching more thought-provoking films while sober.


The dose was taken at 6AM and effects were moderate by 8AM, fully felt by 10AM. Full level effects lasted 4 hours and began to tapper until 6PM. Sleep was difficult and unfulfilling and effects were still noticed late into the next day. Again sleep was less than rewarding on the second day, risperidone and etizolam were taken to enhance what little I got.


One disconcerting aspect was the rise in blood pressure. I'm a regular nicotine user and have a stressful job often working 16 hours a day, so my BP is usually elevated. I noticed a 10-20 point increase in resting BP in days after the memantine. This resolved itself after 3 days but not without experiencing some unpleasant tightness in the chest and shortness of breath.


There are two non-fatal overdoses on record for memantine, one with 2,000mg in a single dose and another with 400mg in a single dose. According to the literature, 300mg is considered a "toxic dose". 


The patient who consumed 2,000mg fell into a coma and experienced convulsions and delirium which lasted 10 days. An intensive blood scrubbing therapy was employed to remove the memantine from her system and she recovered without lasting effect.


The patient who consumed 400mg faired much better and only suffered typical side effects (hallucinations, ataxia, stupor, etc.). Both had dramatically increased blood pressure.


I would say that the biggest risk involved with this substance in relation to its recreational potential stems from the increase in blood pressure. A healthy individual would have no real issue from this, but if you're predisposed to cardiovascular issues it would be wise to steer clear from this substance.


I'm sticking with my plan, to consume 300mg in about 3 days. I wish I knew what effect of the drug caused a rise in blood pressure, I assume it is the dopamine agonism. It would be interesting to block that aspect and see if one can go deeper into the effects without risk/worry of some type of cardiovascular event.

So I did end up going on my 300mg journey, [the trip report can be found here.](https://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads/709412-A-date-with-Memantine-300mg-Semi-experienced?p=12098354#post12098354)


I loved it, the blood pressure effects were still there but milder this time. I think I might have just been too exhausted or sick the previous time I experimented.


I've purchased a significant quantity of the pure powder from a wholesale pharmaceutical supplier for future experimentation.

50mg of memantine was highly enjoyable with similarities to ketamine, but with a clearer, more 'functional' headspace. It's worth noting that it made me unable to sleep for ~12 hours. Plateau was reached 2-3 hours after oral dosing (in pepsi). Willing to try 75-100mg next time.

I found something really interesting.


Donepezil markedly potentiates memantine neurotoxicity in the adult rat brain

[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2246087/](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2246087/)


It seems that ACh agonists make NMDA antagonists (memantine, ketamine, etc) more neurotoxic. I don't know if it's true for nicotinic AChR agonists (nicotine), but they tested it with a muscarinic ACh agonist and it had the same effect as donepezil (which is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, so it elevates ACh levels)


**They tested the neurotoxicity of memantine alone, which is more relevant to our interests.**


[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2246087/figure/F2/](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2246087/figure/F2/)


This dosages are for rats, so we should convert them for humans:


X mg/kg * 0.16 (rat-to-human conversion ratio) * 65 (average human body weight in kgs)


15 mg/kg memantine -> **156 mg** - **No observed neurotoxicity**

20 mg/kg memantine -> **208 mg** - **"Very mild neurotoxicity"**

30 mg/kg memantine -> **312 mg** - **"Very mild neurotoxicity"**

50 mg/kg memantine -> **520 mg** - **"Quite severe neurotoxicity"**


Funnily, John W. Olney worked on this paper.

^Nice post, knockout. Since they hypothesize the damage owes to glutimate-mediated excitotoxicity, I'm surprised in their discussion of potential implications for human users that they never brought up the ketamine findings on monkeys:


> wiki said:

> — wiki said:

Then again, when one of your authors has a brain lesion with his name on it it's probably faux pas to imply the mechanism of its cause may not apply to people using NDMA antagonists. Whether or not memantine does lead to glutimate toxicity in humans, I seriously doubt it's as severe as in rats. It's probably good that very few are interested in taking over 156mg of an atypical dissociative that lasts 24 hours just in case, though, and profoundly less than that looking to do 312mg+.

So I recently added 10 mg memantine HCL in the morning to my regimen of Parnate / Dexedrine and it's been almost inhibiting the positive effects of both, I feel my mood/energy is blunted rather than augmented. Anyone have input regarding this?

As was mentioned memantine has an anti-nootropic effect at the begining of a regime due to it's action on ACh receptors. That could be contributing to the blunting of mood/energy you've described. In addition with such a long half-life I think dosing every other day would be smarter. I have notice that mematine seems to block the effects of nicotine which seems to help one quit smoking but in light of what knockout_mice posted maybe it should be avoided entirely. It does seem to add a nice very subtle buzz to a nootropic regime as well as preventing the potential glutaminergic excitotoxicity of strong ampakines but the temptation to dose slightly higher is always there and with that ridiculous half-life you almost always regret it. 

You get this hey I'm feeling decent maybe if I add 10 more mg I'll still be able to study and feel even better.

The mailman brought me some memantine today.

I just took 10mg, we'll see how it goes with daily 300mg bupropion.


I have ADD-NOS with inattentiveness, before bupropion (wellbutrin) brain fog was bad, so was couch-lock, and depressive episodes, bupropion helped a lot, but I still have issues with getting shit started and finished.


I am hoping memantine can help give me more clarity of mental functions.


I shall see...


Fuck it, I took 10 more mg's.

PowerFarts, as it was mentioned earlier (several times), in the beginning phase it's definitely an anti-nootropic. You won't get "more clarity of mental functions" if you use it for the first time. It will make you really cloudy. Start low and build up your dose to a maximum of 20mg daily.

Yes, day 2 of 20mg all at once.

It's 11:00pm, going to work soon.

I am in that weird predicament where I feel wide awake and sleepy at the same time, I can feel the clarity hiding behind the clouds, ah brain clouds, now I am reminded about the 'me' before wellbutrin.


I have spent years trying suppliments, drugs, excercise, whatever to make me feel more 'with it', maybe I will find the holy grail of 'organised thoughts' or even an organised living environment, I try 10x harder to clean than those of whom you can eat of the floor when one goes to their place.

Day 3, I just got home from work, took 20mg before work. (memantine)

Brain fog going away, clarity fighting through.


Took 20mg's 3,4 CTMP so I could enjoy my day off without needing to sleep (graveyard shift), hopefully no complications.


If I took a recreational dose of 150mg's or 100 to start I won't be fit to drive the next day, will I?

**Is mixing Memantine with Ketamine dangerous?**


I have been looking around to see if there are any supplements that might potentiate ketamine for someone with high tolerance, and in an old post someone mentioned that Memantine could be helpful. Unfortunately they provided no other information regarding their suggestion. I don't know if the user tried it, or has some medical study to back up the claim. I tried contacting the user but to no avail. 


My understanding is that Memantine carries a warning not to mix with ketamine, but I wonder if that is merely because it increases the effects of ketamine (i.e. what I am looking for but what a medicinal user wouldn't want) or if it is because mixing the two substances is dangerous. Does anyone have any insight on this?

I would tend to avoid mixing drugs that act in similar ways. (NMDA antagonists, for example)

Perhaps just try to take MORE ketamine to get stronger effects?

Imean, people die of mixing pain pills with heroin, and people die mixing uppers with uppers.

I think that is a fair caution to take, but both K and Memantine, as far as I know, seem to require very large dosages to be dangerous. So even if one multiplies the effect of the other, I still imagine you would need a very large dose to put yourself in danger. But I don't know, and that's why I'm asking around, in hopes that someone has knowledge in this area.

Before I try this, could someone answer me if I am going to feel miserable because of nicotinic receptor antagonism? I smoke daily and have been doing so for over 10 years. Memantine is an antagonist of the same receptors nicotine activates.

Does anybody know if Memantine is safe to combine with MAOIs? In particular Syrian Rue?


I recently tried combining 20mg of Memantine with smoked DMT and it was an incredible experience, with a strong anti-depressant action that is still very noticeable a week later. I find both to have quite strong anti-depressant effects on their own but there was something really special about this synergy... I would really like to try Memantine + Ayahuasca but am rather cautious as I know MAOI + most dissociatives is a no-no.


I've been using Memantine recreationally for a while now at a variety of doses and absolutely love it. I'd probably say it's the best functional dissociative I've ever tried, even better than low-dose MXE, though high doses are pointless and very uncomfortable.

Several times took 30 mg of memantine. It looks like very clean headed dissociation with almost no physical symptoms. Dissociation is not very pronounced at this dose, but the duration of effects makes me tired. At this moment I am about +20 h past the dose, and the effects are only a little bit more pronounced as at Tmax. Also, i used 500 mg-1 gr of ascorbic acid immediately after memantine to acidify the urine and increase  the elimination rate, but still the effects are too long. I want to try it at 50 mg, but I do not want to spend 2-3 days waiting for effects to stop. Thinking about the memantine and dxm combination to make dxm more dissociative, than stimulating and psychedelic.

Would a dose of 50mgs cause someone who has a history of dissociative abuse to appear intoxicated (slurring, stumbling, etc) ? I haven't used any type of disso in over a year but do feel as if I have a semi-permanent tolerance from a decade of abuse. Was hoping to use ~50mgs to improve my mood at a family function.

I'd try it lower first, in a more controlled environment.  Or hell, you could try it at 50mg in a more controlled environment at minimum.

I am bumping into this after going on a bit of a trip or two with memantine in the past day and however long my second days dose lasts for.


I had a really long, well described, in the moment post about how completely wonderful 75 mg of it felt. Ideally I would have posted it but the page reloaded and I lost all of it. 


To repeat what I wanted to post, it is my opinion that memantine is very recreational, it just happens to have a long duration that needs to be factored in.


To me memantine is a 'grown man's' weekend dissociative. Last night 75 mg was just the perfect amount to make me able to feel electrical body buzz and clear headed dissociation. It has similar stimulation feel to 3-MeO-PCP although not really manic as 3-MeO-PCP gets, the buzz is reminiscent of parts of it to me in that I am thinking of how I am interconnected with the greater universe and the thinking is spacey yet a clear spaciness.


It is also similar to the body buzz of snorted Methoxetamine stimulation without the delusional thought processes that tend to come about, mundane activity is able to be completed with very little interference although I don't think driving a car would be smart, I was able to converse fine with family and noticed unique moments which otherwise would have escaped me, seeing the sparkle in the universe. Was not negative headspace at all, quite the opposite and it allowed me to enjoy bringing of a new year.

The biggest beauty of this to me is that I was able to function reasonably well and could enjoy a positive trip with enough connection to the universe and it's mysteries and not go too far into heavy self analysis. 


This was a soul affirming time that let me look back behind the veil of existence without the over critical thought processes and that introspection to a fault that heavy tripping on serotonin agonists can sometimes give.


I was clear headed in train of thought, things were more mentally open though for sure, all the while still having the dissociative movement mannerisms to a milder degree, that sneaky feeling of being off in another dimension to a degree and at the same time as being present in this dimension physically. Does anyone else know that secret you and the guy in the mirror share when you smile at each other? That feeling and the golden electricity of the buzz.


Similar notes as some of the stimulation of diphenidine but not the buzz, buzz for this is not quite the energy and forcefulness of amphetamine, not a tradional heart racing stimulation, but there is an underlying electrical current that charges you yet sets you back in yourself comfortably.


The electric energy is not like acid where you are jolted with liquid lightning and everything is vibrant but instead is like you have a current flowing through you and you can feel the charge. 


I need to step away from the electric avenue and discuss other aspects I guess, hahaha, time is slowed down and every moment is given a uniqueness, I feel that feeling of almost having a purpose for existing in doing most every task, interactions with others are so meaningful and then shaving my beard just seemed to be good self care. Things felt right, perhaps the stars figuratively align, if you will.


I don't remember my lower dose trials of this(10-30 mg) having as much positive impact on my mental state. I don't feel like on ketamine with the hole state but instead feel in my own world of self debauchery in the most positive sense of the word hahaha.


I am currently on 40 mg dosed the same time as the day befores dose of 75 mg and I am in much the same mood. I would love to be able to put this feeling on paper.

The real fun effects happen at the 100-200mg range with memantine, as I recall.

How manageable is this to do on a Friday at 4 PM and have round out almost completely by the following Sunday night/Monday morning?


I will probably dip in again at the 100 mg mark this coming Friday to find out but would like to hear first if you have any experience.


I may have to play with the acidification of urine to help speed up elimination, I have done DOI and Bromo-Dragonfly so the duration thing isn't overly much of an issue I just want to make sure I will be fine at work on Monday.

Jesus fuck am I high, I forgot how much dissociatives give you the MYSTERY feeling, where things are just kind of sneaky in your perception, something is a little off and hard to pin down, something going on under the radar. Fuck I am going to be frying all night which I guess I am ok with, feeling very similar to some of the manic moments I had with MXE at the moment, more lucid but still feel that I am trying to uncover some well-hidden secret. I don't have any slurring which is good, MXE used to make me slur like a motherfucker. 


This 100 mg vs the 75 mg dose from last week is actually a bit different feeling in character, more stellar high, I guess I wasn't as dissociated with the 75 which makes sense. I need a fucking puzzle to solve or a mystery to figure out or something to fuck my mind, MENTAL SEX, forgot how good that shit feels. Do my words convey what I am trying to say to the reader? How many licks to the center of my mind?

Just wanting to say this for people interested, this is the dose where you will surely NOT EVEN FUCKING THINK ABOUT DRIVING ON. I haven't tried I just know that right now my body is all compartmentalized and my hands are able to do things but the rest of me is kinda hard to describe, damn I know this is pointless in trying to say hahaha, all over I am pretty numb, not quite as electric as last time I took it which is very interesting, the energy kind of converted to mania which I don't mind, I miss me some dopamine in life so this is a good thing. To those that don't find this pleasurable at this dose you must not enjoy dissociatives in general because the body high is fucking amazing, reminds me a bit of methadone which I have only done once, the mindfuck is way different than methadone but I am just trying to put some words to how I feel besides saying that I AM FUCKING FRYING.


Frying has to be my favorite way to describe dissociating. It doesn't feel the same as acid where you get all livened up and plugged in to electricity, this just feels like I am a microwave, if that makes any fucking sense at all haha. I think I am going to watch youtube videos with lasers in them. Lasers sound dope as fuck right now and chemistry is fucking awesome. I am a bunch of fucking non-sense electrons.

I have a bunch of memantine I’ve been meaning to experiment with myself. Haven’t gone beyond 40mg though. Probably 60-75 next.

Did orphenadrine can cause similar effects at higher doses? Although is a antimuscarinic, it has less anticholinergic effects than DPH and is a NMDA antagonist too.

The only problem is: Is OTC here but each pill have metamizole 300 + caffeine 50mg + orphenadrine 35mg

How much is "safe" to achieve a deliriant/dissociative effect?

Remembering that with 4 pills is very stimulant with almost 0 deliriant effects, a little bit dissociative.

Memantine is a weird weird one folks. My first trial at 40mg was just a dopamine faucet on full blast (compulsive online shopping and masturbation) 


my second 40mg dose was standard dissociative fare, with a slight D2 agonist tinge.

The after effects keep me from diving deep with this one, I took 20mg a day for about 5 days and had a horrific anxiety attack the last night of dosing.

Memantine seems very odd, peoples' reactions to it vary wildly all across the board.   My friend who loves dissociatives the most of any class of drugs didn't care for memantine.

never done ketamine, decided to do 130 mg memantine with an experienced k user (his dose of memantine at 190 ![😳](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f633.png)). For almost 2 hours i just felt happy, dancing a little like drunk/mdma. Then i felt a little odd and have no more visual memories, just random bits and pieces of conversation until 2:30 in the morning i became aware again. I felt like a cell on a microscope slide slowly filling with life, nothing but gray monotone existence. Hours later i was me again, trying to maneuver in a jerky physical body but when i closed my eyes i saw such beautiful visuals. Watching universes being built and just feeling like i was so safe and comfortable, nothing i saw was going to hurt me. My partner said yeah, we were in a k-hole, memantine is like k but way longer.

Just picked up 5 g of Memantine. I’m more interested in it’s ability to reduce tolerance buildup and neuroprotective properties. I also currently find myself in a state I swore I’d never return to. 


Over the past couple of years I was able to use benzos twice a week but the last couple months my usage has spun out of control. I’m currently in college at the tail end of completing my BS in chemistry and the course load has become unbearable. 


As such, I began to take adderall to increase my ability to study for longer hours. Amphetamines increase compulsivity thus I started taking more benzos to counteract the negative effects of stimulants. Furthermore, one needs a higher dose of benzos to mitigate these effects. 


Now I feel like I’m on the brink of ruin. All that hard work I put towards school is in serious jeopardy. My memory retention is beginning to deteriorate and I don’t know how I can taper in the midst of taking these difficult courses. 


I’ve also heard Memantine is effective for benzo withdrawals and reducing excitotoxicity. Ugh fucking benzos have been the bane of my existence. When your on them cognition is compromised, but conversely coming off of them turns your brain into scrambled eggs, literally fries you with excess glutumate. 


Hopefully with the aid of NAC and Memantine I can reduce the oxidative stress that accompanies benzo withdrawal, so that I can still function at school. How the hell did I let this happen again. I’ve been through benzo tapers multiple times and the ineffable nightmare that ensues is soul crushing. Damn…

Well, I cant speak to how effective memantine is in this scenario, but on paper it should be rather helpful.


I have been in "How the hell did i let this happen again?" scenarios more times than I'd like to admit. It's easier said than done, but try your best not to beat yourself up. We're all humans and all make mistakes, especially under moments of intense stress. I try not to give advice, but I say do what you have to do to get through school. If it means continuing with benzos then so be it, but I'd urge you to begin a taper ASAP. Make it an extremely slow taper if you have to. Not sure what benzo you've been using but lower your dose even just .1mg every 1 or 2 weeks if you have to take it that slow. Progress is progress and you'll eventually hit a point where your cognition and memory retention start to improve.


Best of luck! Sounds like you're in a stressful ass situation but I have faith that you can manage it! Whatever you do, just don't let your benzo dose increase anymore than it has. The stimulant-downer cycle is a tough one.

The primary benzos I’ve been using are etizolam and clonazepam. As I’ve already mentioned, I was able to keep the usage to twice a week for a year or so, but over summer break I began to increase my intake to 3-4 times a week. Dosages we’re 2-4mg of etizolam or 2mg of Klonopin.


The last two weeks have been non-stop in regards to my consumption of benzos and adderall. Upon waking, I’d take adderall and 1-2 mg of K-pin. When noon would hit I’d take more adderall and 1-2 mg of etiz.   For mitigating the crash and inducing sleep more benzos would follow. 


I honestly can’t even determine my average dosages this past two weeks. I was constantly dosing throughout day and night.


My last dose was 1.5 mg of etiz at 3 am this morning. I then woke up at 1130am and took 80mg of Memantine. Currently I’m feeling relatively content. At 80mg, Memantine feels pretty nice. It’s definitely dissociating at this dose, but mildly so. I can still function and my anxiety is nonexistent at this point, though this is likely due to the half-life of benzos, as the concentration in my bloodstream kept increasing concurrently with my exponential dosaging. 


I believe I’ll be able to utilize Klonopin as my tapering agent as it has a suitable half life for such processes. I’ll try taking .5 mg later today and go from there.


I’ll definitely use Memantine along side my taper, as I can already tell it seems to help reduce the “noise” In my head.

Sounds like you have a decent plan. As long as you can stop escalating that upper-downer cycle. That shit gets out of hand so fast. As you know, just listen to your body and take a benzo when you need it. Once you're out a ways from this 2 week bender then get on a regular tapering schedule. It's good that you have clonazepam at your disposal. It should make tapering quite a bit easier.


What got me into detox this last time was I got myself into that upper-downer cycle with cocaine and amphetamines and Clonazolam. Clonazolam does not have a very long half-life so I was constantly having to top off with it. Such a vicious cycle.


80mgs of memantine sounds like a nice dose. Maybe thats the dose that I'll go for whgen I finally try it. I've been sitting on a little bit of it for a while. Its a fascinating drug pharmacologically. I've just been nervous to take it with its long duration.

Yikes, clonazolam is not a good benzo to become dependent on, yet it’s definitely one of the more recreational benzos in terms of its effects. I had a heavy 3 month run with it 5 years ago or so and stopping it was brutal. Had a couple seizures and left me incapacitated for months.


I have a pretty high dissociative tolerance, but 80mg was a lot more active than I originally thought it was going to be. The duration is quite long. The main effects lasted for 6-8 hours. I had no trouble sleeping on it, but there was some residual wonkiness the next day that lingered around until nighttime. The only reason I took that amount was to attempt to circumvent the crash from a 2 week adderall/benzos binge. The addition of N-acetylcysteine really did help in mitigating the depression, anxiety, and lethargy from my bender.


I’m back to taking 5-10 mg a day which helps keeps my mood in balance. Once I stabilized  at that dose I  haven’t experienced any brain fog or negative side effects. I’d say start at a lower dose and see how you react to it. Even at 80mg I was functional, so I wouldn’t let the duration deter you from trying it out.

Tried out 10mg. Nothing much happened, maybe a hint of a propensity for zoning out? I was drinking my usual liter of coffee, so that could have been covering up. After three hours I redosed 20mg, which I felt coming up after two hours, most noticable as your typical dissociative vision modification.


I like it. The 30mg hasn't been particularly fun, and made me uncomfortable sitting inside reading. It's very clearheaded though, despite the somewhat diminished focus. It feels very medicinal, it's given those typical dissociative perspective shifts already. Just returned from walking off the uncomfortableness, maybe it's been amplifying caffeine anxiety? I can work with this degree of restlessness though, it's not as pronounced as acid microdosing. It's been a spring day during winter, the air was notably fragrant.


Also, suppressed appetite.. not that I had much anyway after half a week of drinking, but still surprising I've only had fruit and veg. Slight headache, nothing pronounced.. apparently that's common for 5-HT3 antagonists.


I had awoken with terrible mood. I've been in a painful place for a while now, drinking regularly 'n regretting half of the messages I've been leaving at bluelight. And initially the 30mg felt confrontational, about the drinking and the problems underlying it.. but now after having ridden the mindspace mood feels markedly improved.


Curious what weed will do to it tonight, and whether sleep will be feasible.


The weather will be nice again tomorrow, tempted to test out the combo with acid microdosing immediately. It will depend on the sleep thing though, if I need a benzo to knock me out then I'm not gonna experiment back-to-back.

Pleasantly surprised with the interaction, or lack thereof, with weed. I was able to close off the day as usual. Slightly harder to go to sleep, nothing remarkable.


Maybe I should have taken that as a hint that memantine generally doesn't interact with psychedelics in the way other dissociatives do, but I accounted for interaction anyway. 20mg memantine on 12 mics acid. Hardly noticed the acid. So took another microdose, and took 50mg more memantine.


The extra acid developed the expected waviness. However, it's as if that extra 50mg memantine never hit. Like, I remember being hit by a 20mg redose yesterday. I didn't expect 50mg not to be noticable.


I suppose that points to a lack of synergy? I mean, I prefer this state over acid alone, I'm in a psychedelic headspace yet not restless. But I'm also sure I should have felt a 50mg redose? I'm feeling it now, half an hour after it should have hit.. but only because I'm actively looking for signs of dissociated perception. Again, it's weird that it didn't "hit".


Undecided as to whether I want to pursue this combination. I guess I'll get to know memantine better first.

I couldn't sleep on the quarter tab of acid plus 70mg memantine, so I took a benzo. Next dag I felt absolutely knackered, no headache or anything but mentally foggier than hungover, beyond the scope of what caffeine can fix. I don't know whether that's your typical memantine crash, or whether it's been significantly compounded by the benzo and the lack of calories.


My preferred method against dissociatives insomnia in general is (very) high doses of CBD, [@plumbus-nine](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/545149/). Commercial products are generally too weak to replace a benzodiazepine, but if you make your own coconut oil extract you can easily guarantee sleep without risk of benzo tolerance, or even the unwelcome combo effects I've gotten sometimes.


I tried the rectal ROA yesterday. My pills contain lactose but, at least at 20mg memantine, not enough to create any noticable adverse effect. Onset started at 25 minutes (tinnitus increased after ten minutes like with pretty much any plugged chemical nowadays), compared to two hours with oral, which I've taken today for comparison's sake. Effects developed up until the two hour mark, but I don't feel I ever got where I am right now even just two and a half hours in. Usually you want to avoid extra bodyload, but it's as if with memantine it's part of the effect?


I've found one other mention of plugging memantine on bluelight, claiming it increases onset and bioavailability. I can confirm it cuts off an hour to an hour and a half from the come-up, but no it does not feel more potent. Nor should it theoretically, memantine is touted be 100% bioavailable orally.


So unless the binders are somehow hampering rectal absorption, I advise against trying to accellerate the effects of this particular compound.

^ [@Chris Timothy](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/217159/) FWIW i've found benzos to potentiate dissociatives to an astonishing degree. Never had memantine but this was my experience with both etizolam+MXE and alprazolam+N2O.

Astonishing, huh? You're piquing my curiosity.. but better not to fiddle with the benzos too much.


There wasn't potentiation to any astonishing degree in my limited personal experience, I mean at the tail end of a dissociative trip benzos do simply knock me out. But when I ended a couple of O-PCE trips with flunitrazolam over consecutive days not so long ago, I ended up with a baseline emotional state of sheer panic. I can't explain that by the workings of the dissociatives, nor the benzodiazepines, alone.


In the MXE days I experimented with lormetazepam. Iirc I plugged the combo, and fell asleep. Next thing I know is violently awaking from a night terror causing 500 bucks of material damage. ![:cry:](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f622.png)


There's certainly *something* going on between those two classes, and I don't like it.

I did 70 mg memantine around 70 hours ago. While commuting home started noticing the effects. Got out of shower disappointed — i didnt get anesthesia, just uncomfortable numbness in my limbs and face especially. Thought i was a got idea to listen to some music. Didnt like it either. There was too much of high frequencies and little to no clarity in sounds. Tried to lay down in silence with no lights on — got flashbacks from work with no ability to keep thoughts in the right track. WHY? Decided to go to sleep, thought i just was too tired to experience the drug. Woke up at T+10 and had no problem sleeping. I think i had dreams, but when i woke up i couldnt remember any details. Smoked a bowl and got to writing music. Uncomfortable auditory distortions disappeared as soon as weed was hitting. I liked the level of immersion i could experience. Done all the projects, smoked another bowl and decided to try out minecraft and civ5. THIS SHIT WAS CRAZY. I got THAT feeling from my childhood when i was allowed to play games half an hour a day from playing minecraft. I felt like was not playing the game through my pc but like i was IN game. I could see everything surrounding me in game even if i wansnt looking, i almost felt the textures, almost smelled what biomes smell like. CIV felt the same. I was aware of what my enemies do even if i didnt met them yet. Couldnt stop smoking for 5 hours. Then decided i had enough and i dont want to experience mj crash in two days so i stopped smoking. Went for groceries, was awkward. Slept another night, vivid dreams, no problem falling asleep and waking up. Woke up still a bit dissociated, but much more manageable than at +10 hours. Food was ok at anytime during the trip (although, it couldve been weed munchies). Then in the evening at aroung +40 hours my bae brought home some weed from dealers new batch and i smoked just a bit too much. It was pure bliss. Just like the first time. I usually get paranoid from lesser amounts of weed, but this time i didnt. Everything around me felt like it was flowing, i had bright CEVS and when i opened my eyes everything i saw so beautiful. Its T+70 hours now and i still can notice minor dissociation and mild motor impairments. Its noticeable harder to work even at this point. But damn, i love memantine for ita ability to reduce tolerance not only for drugs, but to experiences too. 


I got a feeling that memantine is not a good recreational drug by itself but it flourishes in mixing. I have GBL and 5-meo-mipt and would like to try them out with memantine, how do i better mix them?


Overall memantine is 7/10. -1 for duration, -1 for fine motor skills being way below baseline even at T+70, -1 for constipation (3rd day no poop ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png) )

the constipation is the ONE thing (ok, that and money and responsadillatees and whatnot) that keeps me from loving memantine. those poor old elderly people.


just gotta stock up, stool softener and a lotta water/ fiber...


 the constipation is worse than everyday kratom, and maybe even as bad or worse than *most* opioids i remember.

Woke up in the middle of the night and took 90mg.


3 to 4 hours later I arrived in a world disappointingly similar to sobriety. Reading the erowid trip reports got me excited for a higher dose, despite my planned moderation. But it's now being confirmed that if I'm going to replace alcohol with memantine, I will need it weekly, and won't have the tolerance-reset time needed to properly shoot for trippy effects.


So I'm disappointed I don't feel dissociated. I am experiencing the same perks as from 30mg though. Instead of an emotional void there's.. not direct feeling like the serotonergics evoke.. rather a kind of remembering how feeling used to be, detached slivers of the pains before they disappeared into depressed numbness. Again, it's not pleasant, those feelings eroded for a reason after all. But it's a light in the dark.


This shouldn't be too much of a surprise for Alzheimer medication. Depression has a neurodegenerative component, and it seems to be exactly that what memantine fixes. So in that sense it's the exact opposite of a regular antidepressant, which take feelings out of the equation. It's like the different philosophies you're offered in career counseling: fake-it-till-you-make-it versus get-out-of-your-own-way. Both can work, one of 'em has more integrity.


I like how [@nepalnt21](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/427250/) put it. Yes, it's as if it generally reduces tolerance, to chemicals, to experiences, to worn out feelings. I can even smell my own body odor. Not because of lack of hygiene, but because I'm sensing a sensation otherwise repressed, removed by consciousness' redundancy filter. I realize now it was no coincidence the air smelled fragrant on my memantine walk last week. Smell is *the* repressed human sense. And memantine - rather than abruptly un-repressing, like a psychedelic would - creates awareness about the repressed process, by gently removing tolerance.


One paper I skimmed promised clinical trials for memantine for depression two years ago. I hope it makes it through. Non-hedonic non-kidney-kiling ketamine is exactly what psychiatry needs.

I meant I took 90mg and went back to sleep, I don't think I made that clear. I guess that's a relevant factor for evaluating the headspace, I might have noticed more from the 90mg if I had an immediately preceeding sober state for contrast.


I've taken a couple doses of phenibut trying to make the day more pleasant. It indeed worked.. but the emotional confrontation was what assured me my mental state had changed.. now that's gone I'm in a sense closer to sobriety again, lol. 


And just when I say that I'm finally noticing some mild dissociative floatiness. Phenibut might be contributing after all. Others report general synergy between dissociatives and phenibut, I've always found that hard to confirm since most dissociatives blow phenibut out of the water in terms of euphoria. But memantine's humble effect profile leaves plenty room for phenibut to meaningfully add something.


And of course if [@Mjäll](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/110065/) is right and dissociatives and benzodiazepines hugely crosspotentiate, then a GABA-B agonist is expected to enhance memantine.

Memantine isn't a full dissociative, it's rather like buprenorphine to morphine for example. Can be boring for people like me who are looking for a full on dissociative experience. And the insomnia is strong, at least as strong as with ketamine but due to a different mechanism, I think it's because of D2 agonism and the D3 preferring agonist pramipexole abolishes this by balancing dopamine out. But dopamine is funny anyways, in animal tests some had excitatory and others inhibitory D2 receptors. Don't know if this is same in humans.


It took way more than 100mg memantine for me to get some floatyness with eyes closed. No CEVs at all, no dissociative magic but perfect relief of opioid withdrawal.

I'd tolerate the "boredom" in itself, but it's rather hard to tolerate the boredom plus the tinnitus. I.e., for this amount of tinnitus, which is about as much as I'd get on any dissociative, I want more in return, really. My focus was on the novelty of the experience the first couple of doses, but my last dose I realized the bookkeeping just isn't favourable enough for me to continue using memantine as an alcohol replacement. Alcohol, as shitty as it is in many respects, isn't harsher on the broken inner ear than unfermented sugar. 


So cheers to that, I suppose.


I might add that I didn't get any hangover from the 90mg. Which is to say that the hangover I spoke of before surely must have been due to the benzo. On the 90mg I had a bit of an afterglow the next day, and only a bit of an emotional down the day after that.


No problems with sleep on the 90mg dosed at like 4AM.

I’ll try to get this stuff, and will for sure if certain info written in this thread is correct.


But what I’m almost sure in advance from what I learned about it, it’s a a “high” and I’ll enjoy it as I enjoy both high and “high” of many substances but intend to try it an leave it there and mostly just use it for neuroprotecetive effects and opiod wd’s

                                       I hear Memantine is very close to Amantidine, assuming this is fact you will need much more than 100 mgs for a full on dissociative experience I´m afraid . 

                                       As I´ve typed in some other thread I´ve been experimenting ( on and off ) with this compound for about a week ( still under 100mgs -since I get a LOT of unusual, unexpected , great effects from sub therapeutic dosing) or so and here´s what I found . 

                                       The only immediate downside which I´m stuck in for the time being is its corrosiveness ( specially when using powder from capsules sublingually, I´ll try an IR capsule one of these days and update anyways. ) .

                                       Don´t get me wrong, it´s nothing unbearable or visible even ,yet , you can definitely feel it the day after. I can only compare it to the feeling you get when you drink some extremely hot beverage ...having done my research  (PubChem and other sources in the net ) seems I won´t be solving this easily. Already tried turning it into a solution -positive effects are exactly the same ; burns less since it´s not concentrated all in the same place but ,come next day ,you´ll still feel it faintly spread all over your mouth . This makes me question the safety of my chosen ROA (sublingually ) .

                                        As for the "positive effects" mentioned above ...it´s now been over one week ( with a few days off to assess the gravity of the "burn" ) and I can safely say that I´ve never came across any substance which "potentiates " Buprenorphine/benzos the way this does at subjectively low doses ( under 100 mgs ).   

                                       The last time I dosed, it was almost the whole capsule (2/3 at least ) ...late afternoon ( had already taken 4mgs Bupre + 10 mgs Diazepam that morning ). The feeling that sth is about to kick in takes 20 to 30 min. ( very unusual and subtle come up to which I have no point of reference btw ) ...after 1 hour you feel a very unusual clarity. It´s as if you had taken those numbing substances (Bupre+benzos ), and Amantidine somehow cancelled the fog/ slow mental processing and other negative side effects which usually come with long term Benzo + Bupre ab(use). Well into the experience, I felt incredible well, nodding out but feeling great at the same time, as if I had taken a full agonist basically .Mood elevation is very noticeable at 1 hour + into the experience ,albeit weird af .

                                       This very noticeable mood improvement lasts for well over 3 hours on such dose. Keep in mind I´ve tried everything to get the most out of my Opiate maintenance meds -from muscle relaxers to DXM ,trammies, grapefruit etc, etc ... speak of which, here´s another example to make things clearer : I used to feel great when I added a moderate dose of Ketamine or MXE (as with Amantadine, also in the 100mgs range ) to Buprenorphine/benzos ,but every time I did that I was able to easily identify the sum of all its parts ...in here it is very different, it´s like I´m under the influence of a different substance altogether ( Bupre + benzos morph into sth else altogether . ). 

                                       This is a weird one indeed. To sum it up: proceed with care cause the little info on this is sparse and very subjective , there are reports of people having dosed 4Gs for a dissociative experience but I would dissuade people from doing this ...well, a quick visit to PubChem would suffice I think ,but my personal experience on such low doses already tells me that this has the potential to be taxing on the Heart for example. There is a discomfort there which comes and goes , even at just under 100mgs .Not quite increased Anxiety induced ,neither increase in heart rate ...it´s just a faint discomfort ...present nonetheless. 

                                         I apologise for the wall of text but thought I would put this up here since it might be as useful/helpful to some people as it´s been to me .


                                                       Stay safe !

Ok, still experimenting with Amantadine every now and then ,and I did not make this very clear in my last post (maybe it wasn´t even clear to me att lol ) .Thing is I´m basically using this , at sub therapeutic doses at times - others at therapeutic doses ( finally got to experiment with 100mgs/ just once though ) with the main goal of doing my Benzo/Sub taper ( whatever you´re about to read keep in mind that I´m still on Bupre and Benzos ( the equivalent of 15-20 mgs of Diazepam on average ) .

                               I did however experimented with other uses such as : " potentiation"(of ) /" Interaction with other substances I was able to score ( streets )/get scripted ) .

                               Believe it or not the addict in me is yet to allow me to take it as prescribed ( even though there is some issues with it being relatively corrosive when opting for the R(s)OA I do -refrained from IVing it for obvious reasons btw) ... having said this ,all the times I took this drug I either took it sublingually or snorted it -I believe I haven´t read a single trip report on the latter ( Nasal Amantadine) and curiosity took the best of me ( clearly not condoning this since everything within Reason told me not to do it to begin with) .


                               At the time I came across these capsules I was just curious since I had heard about the substance before ,little did I know the many potential uses I will be attributing to this substances below .

                                 Without further due I´ll begin with the " Pros" :

                              - 1st ,in no particular order , would have to be "Mood elevation " - ( to be expected ) effects come quicker snorted but ,between that and sublingual , I would establish an average time for the effects to fully kick in at 20 minutes ( give or take ).

                                 I take the Bupre/benzo "am ".Top up with Amantadine sometime "pm " so this omnipresent umbrella effect must be potentiation of the dose of said substances I took just a few hours prior .Very noticeable each and every time ( even at the lower doses ) ; last time I snorted 100 mgs I even feared not having easy access to this substance cause I´m running out of capsules and convincing my GP that I´m suffering from Parkinson´s is sth I´m not quite sure how to approach .

                               - Another very noticeable one pro is the aforementioned "Potentiation " of the following substances which seemed safe at the following doses : 1 day I took 2/3 of my usual bupre intake ( around 3-4 mgs spreaded out during the day ) in the morning . This time ,instead of the benzo I took some Atarax (Hydroxyzine -lower end , 25 mgs ), few hours after dosed the Amantadine ( 60 -80 mgs eyeballed )...few hours later in the afternoon I took 1 benzo ( 10 mgs diazepam) + 2 x 50mgs + 1 x 100mgs Tramadol ...around 6 -7 pm I was in what I would deem as "recreational territory " ...recreational enough to wish to repeat the experience. Let it be known that Tramadol does not potentiate the others like it did on that day, not even close, Trams are hit or miss here, sometimes I get some glow from mixing it with Bupre ,others -nil, same as having taken jack sh*t .

                                 I did however repeat the experience couple days later, just to be sure about placebos and short term side effects and things of that nature - got the exact same potentiation as opposed to an accumulation of the various substances´s effects .

                                 Put it like this -never any combo missing an opiate agonist tricked me into feeling as if I was in that Zone. Not even remotely close. It´s a very weird zone though ...like doing some new opiate agonist for the 1st time ...the dreamy nature of the experience is there -that fine line between being awake and dreaming from one sec to the next - so is the well being of an opiate agonist however alien and strange as it may feel .

                                 - Another aspect which did not became clear to me in the 1st few times I tried Amantadine with Bupre/Diazepam was its analgesic effects ...I have a couple herniated disks which at times give me trouble and I certainly can feel them when my work out is moderate/intense  ,specially at my age - the other day it was moderate enough to have me feeling all sore basically ...upon taking the Amantadine I no longer felt any muscle ,disk, stomach discomfort I had been having that day ...all moderate pain which the buprenorphine didn´t solve earlier on, Amantadine did -everything . Just like when I was on Heroin ...the analgesic effects of this combination are sth which should not be ignored especially since I hear a lot of people struggling with Fibro and such ( and without easy solutions ). I reckon this combo of relatively easy to obtain substances would solve their problems . Again, not experience enough to be 100% accurate .


                                  As for the " Cons " ...I should probably not be snorting this ...I´ve researched this enough to know that it irritates the eyes (inclusive ) ,and for some reason, upon snorting it, 1 hour later or so I feel this irritation as when you´re exposed to some corrosive vapours ...not enough to dissuade you from doing it though.

                                  The biggest "Con " which makes me afraid to try ,says, half a gram in one sitting is this heart discomfort which is present 4 to 5 hours after dosing ...it´s actually interesting cause you´re feeling great but at the same time there´s this discomfort which feels unusual -again , from Web research, I know Amantadine can cause arrythmias and things of that nature ...it´s not increase/decrease in heart rate ,that never worried me much ...it´s a constant feeling which makes you feel can turn into sth unpleasent/unpredictable if dose is increased by much . 


                                 And here it is. I apologise for both the rather redundant wall of text , and for not trying 1 kg in one sitting and typing back any subsequent breakthrough alienation/revelation  ![😂](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f602.png). 

                                 Nothing eventful here    ... yet, if , for example, somebody with chronic pain reads this boring wall of text and decides to try Amantadine + Bupre under supervision (and as prescribed preferably ) and subsequently finds relief from her/his discomfort ..."mission accomplished !" you know ?

Random little report:


A couple of weeks ago I had taken the normal 30mg of Memantine, had a run in the evening and a toke at night. I had a peculiarly bodily high, it felt like some sort of delayed runner's high. Opioid highs aren't my thing anyway, but there it was.


I normally don't get runner's high, not sure why. And I'm also not sure whether or not these three activities had crossed each other before. Maybe there are other factors, no clue.


But it's an interesting experiment in case there are others who don't get runner's high. Combine with Memantine and weed and report back. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Figuring it's gonna be a quiet, cool summer day which might not come along again anytime soon, I've taken 150mg of Memantine, over three hours ago.


At this dose at least it feels different from 30mg. There are hints of dopaminergic action, and the field of vision has a slight firmness to it, reminiscent but alas dissimilar from the dissociative state. So it's a bit disappointing, might as well make an acid microdose day out of it.


What's nice though is that it takes away my hangover tonal tinnitus and turns it into static. Which is what would be expected from a kind of super-magnesium molecule.


I guess there's much more cross-tolerance between Memantine and the ACHs than I had hoped. Of course it's just all targeting the glutamatergic system.

Memantine is a great medicine but as a drug...well in smaller doses it’s a CBD of NMDA antagonists while in bigger, not so fun. After 250 – 300mg (initial dose was somewhere between 140 and 170) in 2 days or so at one point after smoking joint I felt, well not so fine. Kind of like too much 3-meo-PCP can make you feel but without any fun….really kind of, I could use other compensations too….like it brings certain aspects K brings but without almost any visuals, without complex mindfuck, without...a lot of that that K hash but at big dose you can definitely feel those two are in the same group. I feel (but might check out just in case one day) like pushing dose really high with this would not end good, in a sense it would be unpleasant high. At dose of about 150mg it’s pretty subtitle but still on a side where a drink or too or something else can make it pleasant but anything significantly higher than that and it starts feeling a bit unpleasant cuz you do get high as fuck but too much of usual recreational NMDA antagonist effects are lacking making it…


O yeah, when it comes to reducing/regulating opiod tolerance IT WORKS! Coupled with fact it’s good for a brain, more so for a damaged brain I’m sad it isn’t easily available to me (as I thought it will be after getting first gram).. This should be OTC! I really mean it (well like many of you I think a lot of stuff or everything should be but memantine even more so)….ffs if benedryl and such poisons are OTC...wtf!?

A combination of complex factors including direct spirit guidance with years of omens resulted in me buying a kilo of Memantine for less than a thousand bucks ![:oops:](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f633.png)

**100mg Memantine HCl test**


dose: 100mg [Memantine HCl](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Memantine) (roughly equivalent to 30mg MXE, my default increment)


It readily dissolved in a fluid ounce of water. I can't find what constitutes a saturated solution. Most sources parrot the 1-2mg/ml the medicinal solutions come in but there's more to it.

2% solubility should be achievable with a molecule like this.


Took it at 14:14h, coincidentally.

I got a great coincidental plan ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

(..)


at 35min appreciable oomph and hissing tinnitus already.


(..)


4:30 into it.


At 1:30 it dawned on me that 100mg for me indeed is session strength, and now, 3 hours later, its stronger still.


It totally hits the mark of being equivalent to a standard increment of about 30mg MXE = 10mg O-PCE.


Like 30mg methoxetamine = 250mg ketamine oral, 100mg memantine for me has the Spiritual/magical Entheogenic quality that I require for a dissociative dose to be of "session strength". For the first time in my experimentation with the substance, i'm "in a session" in the entheogeni sense, well beyond medication.


5:00 into it and riding the session into the evening (19:14pm) at full force and perhaps going stronger (effects increase for about 6-8 hours)


clearheaded, non-mindfuck. There is some stimulation going on, i hope i can sleep tonight but willing to ride it out if insomnia occurs.


The eyes and ears are disproportionally affected with Memantine, Tinnitus is a constant and so are disscociative accomodation disturbances.


I want te Be, not Do = tripping indeed ![:love:](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f60d.png)


(..)


9 hours into this, its still ++ but going a bit shallow, it's 23:15 PM though so hooray, I might catch my bed before the sun comes up.


It is satisfactory as a dissociative.


Heavy doses, ie, diminishing returns, start at 170mg according to psychonautwiki.


(..)


Just about on the 12 hour point. coming down so gradually, there is no nostalgia, what a great day it has been, and chances are i might sleep in a couple hours or so, 14 hours into it.


It would be ridiculous to take a booster, there is no interest in it.


The 100mg side effects were clear: there still is nuisance tinnitus, eyes are levelling again, there was phlegh reminisent of having a bit of a old, as reported, the saliva and mucus effects were akin to Tiletamine but more in the back of the nose and throat than the mouth.


Bodyload was by all means acceptable.


I'm curious what tomorrow will bring, or the rest of the week for that matter.


100 seems just right for me.


Qualitatively, this is quite a good dissociative. Emotion and thought are very mobile in all directions, but tend to be positive and composed. For me spirituality is around every corner on this dose, but holds for the brutally mundane stuff. I was reasonably mentally funtionalk throughout and diodnt have the robowalk. I can see people saying this feels inbetween DXM and Ketamine.


Zero nausea but there was diarroea, which i think stems chiefly from trimagnesium citrate taken yesterday.


I -really- liked this, and hope that lighthousing 100mg once a week as a means to both session 1 day and medicate the rest of the week wihj the residual blood levels of this powerful nootropic is possible for me.


That would be a VERY awesome routine.


.


In darkness there were very enticing visuals, far more symbolical as generic O-PCE did for me. They were a bit faint but, worth watching anbd i definitely shouldve spent more time with closed eyes this session, during the thick of it.

I woke up after 6 hours of refeshing sleep (+20h wakeup).

now, +24h, i have a delightful aftereffect, reminiscent of.. a day after 30mg MXE.

Loving it.


Still in that afterglow, now in the evening of the second day. I compared the total accumulated dose of 100mg once a week vs taking 20mg once a day:


============          

100mg memantine 1x per week, halflife 84h:

Repeat the dose every 168 hours to reach a steady state in **5 doses** or **35days**. Concentration in your body will vary at **33.20 - 133.20mg**with an average of **83.20mg**.

20mg memantine 1x per day, halflife 84h:

Repeat the dose every24 hours to reach a steady state in **16 doses** or **16 days**.Concentration in your body will vary at **86.64 - 106.64mg** with an average of **96.64mg**.


You will eliminate 97% of the drug in **17.71 days** if you quit cold turkey.    

============


As you see, using as directed has you at 3/4 of 100mg/wk's peak value all the time, while the weekly use descends into a deep valley.


That's lighthousing: one pulse every so often while being significantly affected inbetween.


Whatever fryday/shatterday weekly dose you take of this drug, 1/3 of the last dose is still in your system if you keep it steady.

Datapoint: 100mg Memantine HCl dissolved readily into 5ml water in a champagne flute (solubility >20mg/ml) by swirling it.

I drank it down with dilute lemon juice. This resulted into a FAST comeup and intensity not of my choosing! Within half an hour it was uncharacteristically strong and in an hour and a half i was at a strength normally achieved 3 hours in. It peaked at 5 hours in (not 8) and decreased from there.


On the Shroomery we have the LemonTEK where dried shrooms predigested in a shotglass of lemon juice gives inreased but shorter lived performance, also with other drugs.

I speculate that taking your Memantine in the juice of one lemon produces memantine dihydrogen citrate, citric acid being a krebs cycle aid, which gets it absorbed and distributed faster and therefore, with a steeper higher peak.


I was not cool with this, 5mg valium was used to curb anxiety.


I think i'm going to try lemonTEK-king 50mg next week.


I also started to use a magnesium supplement, maybe that helped it.

Datapoint:


In the past days I deliberately HAVEN'T taken my 1.5gr trimagnesiumcitrate (.25gr Mg++) and today as planned I didnt take 100mg proper but instead 50mg + LemonTEK.


I can pretty much rule out the LemonTEK as helping speed of absorption and intensity, the 50mg was the same as 50 without lemon.


It looks like the magnesium supplement is the potentiator.


I'll see about that next week.


Diarrhoea during the first hours is a thing for me, this time there was no trimagnesiumdicitrate so it was purely a Memantine effect


50mg is nice and relatively functional.


I wonder what 75mg would bring.

After more experimentation, my sweet spot is about 75mg once weekly.


there is zero push to dose higher or more often and i was an arylcyclohexylamine fiend.

That stopped too. Only MMT for me.

i'm on week 3 of a hiatus: my plan is to dose 75mg at christmas.


Constipation wasnt problematic for me, but i have good bowel habits, such as a daily bowl of oatmeal. Poop was a bit thicker on days 2 and 3 but, not constipatingly so.


Codeine is my recipe for concrete, low medical doses lok me up.


Oddly, arylcyclohexylamines always gave me the runs and diuretic effect, the opposited of memantine.


Zero craving though.

I'm the shroomery Methoxetamine guy, now versed in O-PCE and Memantine.


Dissocatives reduce the sensory input bandwidth and your brain fills up the hole in the data stream wit internal musings from the realkms of fantasy, dreams and delirium - hallucination.


its like LSD and Shrooms, just not through 5-HT2 but NMDA.


I let trips happen to me as they are and surrender to them.


BDSM, i let the trip "do me" voluntarily with me as the Sub and the Entheogen as the Dom.


God/superconscious uses this to steer me towards healing and meaningful experiences.


I'm Aladdin, lamp in my lap, tranquilly, while the Djinn teaches and heals me.


I experience the most epic adventures by my complete surrender to even mediocre doses, my God/Higher Self treats me to evermore gobsmacking, stunnng adventures. 


A shaman and his Spirit friends, playing and doing highly important things while the body and brain rest.


Memantine = Mescaline


one dose and your day is done.


I only take it when my higher self/God asks it so i have a habit but initiative is His. If he says no, its absolutely no. If I dont want to, or disagree with the proposed dose: no deal.


the vial lies by my laptop for weeks, sometimes i ingest on request, usually i don't. My God's NO is NO to me so its ok as it goes.


if you are into arylcyclohexylamines you are basially into heroin with your ketamine, s i say, try methadone, less fun but good enough, mematine.


people use memantine and arylcyclohexylamines to quit opioids and stimulant addictions.


memantine shares a cage like structure and sigma agonism with Ibogaine. Both have anti addictive traits..


just saiyan'


[https://omnicyclion.org/divinity-bl...edicine-memantine-as-a-sacred-meditation-aid/](https://omnicyclion.org/divinity-blessed-iboga-like-neuroprotective-medicine-memantine-as-a-sacred-meditation-aid/)


You have a substance that is an essential medicine, memantine, it has the gram potency of MDMA (entheogenic dose range 25-250mg), it lasts all day, it is not a controlled substance in any country, no clear abuse association and its n many jursdictions as legal to possess as acetaminophen, costing a thousand bucks for a kilogram.


its out there at nootropic sites and abuse issues dont really occur, again, just saiyan' 


so far im experience none of the arylcyclohexylamine compulsion i had with MXE and O-PCE.


it has that adamantane-like three ring cage in common with ibogaine, ibogaine has the nitrogen in it, memantine has the nitrogen sticking out of it, both sigma opioid agonists with tolerance reverting and addiction breaking effects.


think about it...

###### nepalnt21 arylcyclohexylamines have that three ring circus quality, the 3D diamond cage of memantine and amantadine is shared by ibogaine and voacangine. All 4 share sigma opioid agonism and association with tolerance reduction of multiple drugs and antiaddictive effects.fastandbulbous... ring ring ring, bananaphone?

As experimentation continues, the 80-100mg range for me seems to be a sweet spot. It is enough to be Entheogenic but nothing too wild.


I'm noticing interesting auditory effects sometimes intrude on te experience, some intense DJ-ing is going on sometimes in my mind. 


Sometimes i use twice a week, sometimes i skip some weeks. compulsion is not an issue for me, unlike with Arylcyclohexylamines.


It helps me harmonize with Dvinity and life with chronic pain.


it is a shame to see so little experimentation going on with this blessed medicine.

I can't have MXE or O-PCE in my house because of compulsive redosing. 


I in fact own a metric shitton of Memantine, but i simply take lets say 100mg, am high all day, go to bed satisfied and then for days or weeks I don't touch the stuff and am mentally unbothered by it.


If i were to take it a few days in a row the effects get completely undesirable fast. It actively discourages redosing and multi day usage in entheogenic doses.


You can't abuse it because it makes you instantly regret it for a good while.


It's its own harm reduction program ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

K consequently prevented not only difficulty falling  a sleep during coming down.

So didnt have to sit it out, just passed out after a few bumps of K. 

Which effects ime are magnified during the MDMA afterglow.


And like you describe whenever K was involved next day / week blues where gone.

Anybody knows why, seems very logic but why it works so well i cant tell.

I been on and on about memantine, the virtually unknown dissociative and i got mixed reactions on it, with many "sparing my feelings" because i'm well, like, Asante, who is liked here for his personality and history here


I prompted ChatGPT with the link to the zealously written post with audacious claims about God and all that.


I didnt tell AI it was me and set it up for an empathetic but factually correct analysis.


What came out, his reply, was so informative and Erowid worthy, I had to drop the link here.


its more conservative than psychonautwiki, by far, but its fact checked and its true.


consider it a link to Erowid or Psychonautwiki.


I like what i post and stand for it.. nuff said.


Its way more conservative than I am but its informed by cold logic and facts with a humanitarian agenda.

this substance sounds amazing. I’m one of those people who thinks clearer on 3meopcp or ketamine.. and something like this would be a dream come true. Being able to go about my daily business but with a dissociative glow? Is this the type of thing available by nootropic depots and the likes? Or is it prescription only??

We don't discuss sourcing here. Legality may vary based on where you live. I live in the States, where it isn't illegal. 


In my own personal experience (YMMV,) it's a long-lasting, but relatively mild NMDA antagonist. It caused me to feel pleasant at first, then caused highly unpleasant brain fog and deepening dissociation over time. I was taking it to try to improve my memory and cognitive function, so I discontinued it after two separate cycles. I could see it being a slippery one personally with regards to delusional thinking, as it is remarkably long lasting. I get delusional thoughts 48hrs after a hole dose of ketamine, and that's nowhere near as long acting.

this stuff is no good in significant repeat doses, its like what LAAM is to opioids or phenazepam to benzos, a multi day thing.


Here in holland its non "drug law" prescription medicine, so its legal to own as if it were powdered paracetamol. I won't discusses sources as per the rules but chatGPT says that in the pharmaceutical trade its a fine chemical in the $60-150/kg price range. It doses like MDMA (50-200mg recreational range)  a person on this site just deposited a OD trip report on 500mg which was "more euphoric then MDMA" and an all weekend thing with complete transformation of external reality. On day 2 he was all over town, flirty and extraverted.

totally not recommended in that dose, psychonautwiki checks out at 170mg and i personally took up to 250mg.


Its unsuitable for repeat dosing cause it stacks miles high if used daily at a 60-100h halflife.


if you take a teaspoon of vitamin c 3x a day in a glass of juice you excrete it faster in the acidic urine.


I can have a vial of it sit next to my laptop for 3 weeks untouched, it lives up to its nonaddictive name despit me being a complete Methoxetamine slut.


its best used once every 1-4 weeks in a 50-150mg dose. If you're a weekend warrior (friday highday mayhem) this stuff is legit.


a 100mg dose feels like a quarter botttle of vodka lasting all day so the rave/festival potential is great

I take it back! I made some 80mg memantine capsules (size 1 loosely filled) for taking 1-2, 2 being positively a dissociative trip lasting all day.


But, if you take 80mg you get high, if you the next day take 80mg again you get higher! After that you gotta let your levels drop again. don't go over 170mg/wk.You can but you'll be perma-blitzed and odd. I did a month and a half of that as a painkiller to not have to use liquid morphine, it worked but i was whacked out of my mind to a degree not everybody appreciated :D 


Taking 1 cap then dropping one 2 hours later was very nice, prolonging that climb by 2 hours.

I've been herding data sources into an AI, asking it to perform searches in various fields regarding Memantine, and to compact and revise to incorporate the new insights.

I ended up with this, and in my ample experience with MMT it does ring true to my ear.


-


**Memantine** is a synthetic dissociative compound from the adamantane class, primarily known as an NMDA receptor antagonist. While it is medically used in the treatment of moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease, it is occasionally used recreationally for its long-lasting dissociative effects.

##### Dosage and Effects at Recreational Use (~100 mg)​


An oral dose of 70–110 mg is considered common in recreational contexts. At this level, the following effects may occur:


- **Physical:**

A sense of bodily lightness, increased control over body movements, stimulation, appetite suppression, nausea, pain relief, constipation, difficulty urinating, dizziness, headache, increased heart rate, and visual distortions.
- **Visual:**

Color enhancement, sharper visual acuity, afterimages, changes in depth perception, environmental distortions, and hallucinations.
- **Cognitive:**

Cognitive euphoria, conceptual thinking, time distortion, enhanced creativity, deeper appreciation for music, increased motivation, reduced anxiety, disinhibition, suppression of dreams and memory, and slowed thoughts.


The effects typically begin within 30 to 180 minutes after ingestion, peak between 3 to 12 hours, and can last up to 36 hours, followed by an afterglow lasting 8 to 24 hours.

##### Risks and Side Effects​


At higher doses, more serious side effects may occur, including hallucinations, confusion, drowsiness, dizziness, agitation, aggression, and impaired motor function. In extreme cases, such as doses around 2000 mg, coma and long-lasting neurological symptoms have been reported.


Memantine has a long half-life (60–100 hours), meaning it remains in the body for an extended period. This increases the risk of cumulative effects with repeated use. It may also interact with other NMDA antagonists (like amantadine, ketamine, or dextromethorphan), heightening the risk of adverse effects.


---


##### Conclusion​


While memantine can produce dissociative and hallucinogenic experiences at recreational doses, it carries significant risks—especially at higher levels. Its long duration of action and potential for interaction with other substances make it complex and potentially dangerous to use non-medically. Caution and awareness of these effects are essential.

I have gotten into some weeks of heavy use of Memantine, with days of 100-400mg, once even 600mg in one day. doses were typically 100-200mg apiece.

Over a time frame of approximately two and a half months I used approximately *15 grams* of memantine, or about 200mg/day on average.

There was dizzyness, the occasional highly stimulated afterphase with anxiety, a good number of all-night meditations.

This led to exhaustion, falling asleep on the couch repeatedly, and waking in bed after 4-8 hours of *not turning in bed at all* leading to backache, just sleeping motionless.


I have since stopped this binge use and there was zero compulsion to take another dose, just NONE. My binge use wasnt compulsive, I just chose to do so without any addictive push to hide behind, I just did something ill advised and when I quit doing it it was over, no need to flush any leftovers or apply willpower. It wasnt a tug-of-war like every damn time with arylcyclohexylamines.


After quitting i stayed high for like 4 days, i think i had maybe a gram in my system from accumulation.


I got a bit "dissociative weird" but it didnt take psychotic-like dimensions like arylcyclohexylamines can do so well.


Memantine "robo walk / dissociative zombie shuffle" definitely is a thing at high doses, caused some hilarious situations with next to nil social anxiety about being half retarded ![:p](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)


Harm reduction means don't fricking do what i did here. i'm a big boy, 135kg, who is seasoned in dissociatives, a standard person would fry his nuts off in a most unpleasant way.


Going through 150 capsules of 100mg each in 2.5 months is madness in sparta. Don't.


If i was in denial about being addicted I wouldnt have posted this cause in reaction to this post people are going to say i'm in denial ![:cautious:](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f612.png) No: I did a dumb thing without feeling a craving to do so, i fully own this and i'm glad nothing bad appears to have come from it.


I underline the maximum dosage given by psychonautwiki of 170mg and stress that in a toxicological back-and forth, GPT-4o estimated the mortality risk of 500mg taken at once might carry an 0.5-2% acute mortality risk in a standard person if left untreated and that memantine poisoning can be a highly dysphoric prolonged bout of suffering with risk of permanent damage.
