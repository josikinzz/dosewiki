*Source: https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB00962*

## Overview

### Description

This compound belongs to the class of organic compounds known as phenylpyrimidines. These are polycyclic aromatic compounds containing a benzene ring linked to a pyrimidine ring through a CC or CN bond.  Pyrimidine is a 6-membered ring consisting of four carbon atoms and two nitrogen centers at the 1- and 3- ring positions.

### Background

Zaleplon is a sedative/hypnotic, mainly used for insomnia. It is known as a nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic. Zaleplon interacts with the GABA receptor complex and shares some of the pharmacological properties of the benzodiazepines. Zaleplon is a schedule IV drug in the United States.

### Indication

For the treatment of short-term treatment of insomnia in adults.

### Pharmacodynamics

Zaleplon is a nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic from the pyrazolopyrimidine class and is indicated for the short-term treatment of insomnia. While Zaleplon is a hypnotic agent with a chemical structure unrelated to benzodiazepines, barbiturates, or other drugs with known hypnotic properties, it interacts with the gamma-aminobutyric acid-benzodiazepine (GABA
B
Z) receptor complex. Subunit modulation of the GABA
B
Z receptor chloride channel macromolecular complex is hypothesized to be responsible for some of the pharmacological properties of benzodiazepines, which include sedative, anxiolytic, muscle relaxant, and anticonvulsive effects in animal models. Zaleplon also binds selectively to the CNS GABA
A
-receptor chloride ionophore complex at benzodiazepine(BZ) omega-1 (BZ1, ο1) receptors.

### Mechanism of Action

Gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor subunit alpha-1
Potentiator

### Absorption

Absorption Zaleplon is rapidly and almost completely absorbed following oral administration.

### Metabolism

Zaleplon is primarily metabolized by aldehyde oxidase.

### Half-life

Approximately 1 hour

### Toxicity

Side effects include abdominal pain, amnesia, dizziness, drowsiness, eye pain, headache, memory loss, menstrual pain, nausea, sleepiness, tingling, weakness

### Drug Interactions

This information should not be interpreted without the help of a healthcare provider. If you believe you are experiencing an interaction, contact a healthcare provider immediately. The absence of an interaction does not necessarily mean no interactions exist.

1,2-Benzodiazepine
The risk or severity of CNS depression can be increased when Zaleplon is combined with 1,2-Benzodiazepine.
Abacavir
Zaleplon may decrease the excretion rate of Abacavir which could result in a higher serum level.
Abametapir
The serum concentration of Zaleplon can be increased when it is combined with Abametapir.
Abatacept
The metabolism of Zaleplon can be increased when combined with Abatacept.
Acalabrutinib
The metabolism of Zaleplon can be decreased when combined with Acalabrutinib.

### Food Interactions

Avoid alcohol. Ingesting alcohol may increase the CNS depressant effects of zaleplon.
Do not take with or immediately after a high-fat meal. The effects of zaleplon are reduced when taken with a high-fat meal.

### Mechanism of action

Zaleplon exerts its action through subunit modulation of the GABA
B
Z receptor chloride channel macromolecular complex. Zaleplon also binds selectively to the brain omega-1 receptor located on the alpha subunit of the GABA-A/chloride ion channel receptor complex and potentiates t-butyl-bicyclophosphorothionate (TBPS) binding.

Humans

### Volume of distribution

1.4 L/kg

### Protein binding

Approximately 60% (in vitro plasma protein binding).

### Route of elimination

Zaleplon is metabolized primarily by the liver and undergoes significant presystemic metabolism. After oral administration, zaleplon is extensively metabolized, with less than 1% of the dose excreted unchanged in urine.  Renal excretion of unchanged zaleplon accounts for less than 1% of the administered dose.

### General Function

Oxidase with broad substrate specificity, oxidizing aromatic azaheterocycles, such as N1-methylnicotinamide, N-methylphthalazinium and phthalazine, as well as aldehydes, such as benzaldehyde, retinal, pyridoxal, and vanillin. Plays a key role in the metabolism of xenobiotics and drugs containing aromatic azaheterocyclic substituents. Participates in the bioactivation of prodrugs such as famciclovir, catalyzing the oxidation step from 6-deoxypenciclovir to penciclovir, which is a potent antiviral agent. Is probably involved in the regulation of reactive oxygen species homeostasis. May be a prominent source of superoxide generation via the one-electron reduction of molecular oxygen. May also catalyze nitric oxide (NO) production via the reduction of nitrite to NO with NADH or aldehyde as electron donor. May play a role in adipogenesis
