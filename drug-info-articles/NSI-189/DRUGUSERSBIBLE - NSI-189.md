## Subjective Experience

NSI-189 has been researched and investigated as a potential antidepressant, and as
an agent for the treatment of cognitive impairment and neurodegeneration. Its
efficacy has been vigorously debated over a number of years.

I pursued and sampled it following positive reports across a couple of specialist
Internet forums.

Hardly surprisingly from a single experiment, I noticed very little. Like most
nootropics it isn’t geared for recreational use.

Whilst I experienced no ill or negative effects, it is unlikely that I will return to it for
any further testing.
