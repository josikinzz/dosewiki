Fluorolintane (also known as 2-FPPP and 2-F-DPPy) is a dissociative anesthetic drug that has been sold online as a designer drug.
Fluorolintane and related diarylethylamines are antagonists of the NMDA receptor and have been studied in vitro as potential treatments for neurotoxic injury, depression and as sympathomimetic.
