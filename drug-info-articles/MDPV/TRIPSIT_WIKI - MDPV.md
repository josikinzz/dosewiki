# MDPV

*Source: https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/MDPV*

**Methylenedioxypyrovalerone** (MDPV) is a potent, synthetic euphoric stimulant, which shares some of the empathogenic effects of MDMA and acts as a norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI). It is known for its tendency to cause compulsive redosing and some users report sexual arousal. MDPV (together with Methylone and Mephedrone) is one of the first substances that have been found in products sold as "bath salts", "plant food/fertilizer", and in some "ecstasy" pills.

## History

MDPV was first developed in the 1960s by a team at Boehringer Ingelheim. It remained an obscure stimulant until around 2004 when it was reportedly sold as a designer drug. Products labeled as bath salts containing MDPV were previously sold as recreational drugs in gas stations and convenience stores in the United States, similar to the marketing for Spice and K2 as incense.

## Chemistry and Pharmacology

Systematic name: (RS)-1-(Benzo[d][1,3]dioxol-5-yl)-2-(pyrrolidin-1-yl)pentan-1-one

MDPV is the 3,4-methylenedioxy ring-substituted analog of the compound pyrovalerone, developed in the 1960s, which has been used for the treatment of chronic fatigue and as an anorectic, but caused problems of abuse and dependence. However, despite its structural similarity, the effects of MDPV bear little resemblance to other methylenedioxy phenylalkylamine derivatives such as 3,4-methylenedioxy-N-methylamphetamine (MDMA), instead producing primarily stimulant effects with only mild entactogenic qualities.

## Legal status

MDPV is currently in Schedule I in the United States. This means it is  illegal to manufacture, buy, possess, or distribute (sell, trade or  give) without a DEA license.

MDPV is also illegal in Australia, Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Hungary, Israel, Sweden and the UK.
