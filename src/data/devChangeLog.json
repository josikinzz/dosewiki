It was developed alongside MGM-16 as mu/delta-opioid dual agonists; animal and in vitro work consistently finds MGM-16 more potent than MGM-15. Human pharmacokinetics for MGM-15 are unknown; harm-reduction dosing must rely on cautious titration and scattered user reports. Duration described online is longer than 7-OH, with many reporting 6-12 h between doses, which increases overdose risk if redosing too early. Do not combine with other depressants; claims that kratom-derived opioids lack respiratory depression are not supported by clinical data and should not be trusted. Product variability is extreme: vendors sell different salts/purities and the name may cover nonidentical compounds; start low, weigh with a 0.001 g scale, and avoid eyeballing. Because identity is often uncertain, consider third-party analytical testing (LC-MS/HPLC) where available; reagent kits are not reliable for this class. Users attempting to substitute MGM-15 for 7-OH often report lower-per-dose numbers than their 7-OH habits (e.g., single-digit to tens of mg), but some report needing 50-100 mg depending on tolerance and source potency; this spread likely reflects tolerance, salt form, and adulteration. Expect typical opioid effects and adverse effects: miosis, pruritus, constipation, nausea, sedation, and potential respiratory depression at high doses or with CNS depressants. Set a firm session cap before dosing, wait a full 3-4 h before considering any redose, and prefer single-route, single-substance trials to understand sensitivity. Tapering strategies reported online (using small repeated doses of MGM-15 to replace frequent 7-OH) are anecdotal and carry dependence risks; if dependent, seek medical support.\",\n+    \"notes\": \"Amobarbital (formerly sold as Amytal and as half of Tuinal) is an intermediate-acting barbiturate that potentiates and directly activates GABA_A receptors. The therapeutic index is narrow: doses above ~1.5 g have produced fatal respiratory depression. Because its elimination half-life averages 24 h, next-day cognitive and motor impairment is common. Combining with any CNS depressant dramatically amplifies overdose risk. Repeated daily use for a week or more can generate severe dependence; abrupt cessation requires medical tapering to prevent life-threatening withdrawal.\",\n-      \"analgesia\",\n-      \"anxiolysis\",\n-      \"warmth/euphoria\",\n-      \"sedation\",\n-      \"itching/pruritus\",\n-      \"miosis (pinpoint pupils)\",\n-      \"GI slowing/constipation\",\n-      \"reduced cravings for other opioids (anecdotal)\"\n+      \"Anxiolysis\",\n+      \"Euphoria\",\n+      \"Disinhibition\",\n+      \"Sedation\",\n+      \"Muscle relaxation\",\n+      \"Ataxia\",\n+      \"Slurred speech\",\n+      \"Dizziness\",\n+      \"Nystagmus\",\n+      \"Cognitive suppression\",\n+      \"Anterograde amnesia\",\n+      \"Dream-like state\",\n+      \"Emotional dampening\",\n+      \"Respiratory depression at high doses\"\n-      \"full_tolerance\": \"can develop within days of daily use\",\n-      \"half_tolerance\": \"3-7 days after last use (highly variable)\",\n-      \"zero_tolerance\": \"2-3+ weeks after last use (conservative estimate)\",\n+      \"full_tolerance\": \"7 – 14 days of continuous use\",\n+      \"half_tolerance\": \"≈ 1 – 2 weeks after cessation\",\n+      \"zero_tolerance\": \"4 – 6 weeks abstinent\",\n-        \"7-hydroxymitragynine\",\n-        \"mitragynine/kratom\",\n-        \"classical opioids (morphine, oxycodone, fentanyl)\"\n+        \"Other barbiturates\",\n+        \"Benzodiazepines\",\n+        \"Z-drugs\",\n+        \"GABAergic sedatives\"\n-    \"half_life\": \"unknown in humans (anecdotal duration suggests multi-hour activity)\",\n+    \"half_life\": \"8 – 40 h (mean ≈ 24 h)\",\n-        \"name\": \"Matsumoto et al. 2014 (primary;

Modern reports describe it as a stimulant with a profile somewhere between methylphenidate and MDPV, with strong drive to re-dose every 2–3 hours. Its pharmacology shows high affinity inhibition of dopamine and norepinephrine transporters, with negligible serotonin activity, producing a stimulation that is clean but also edgy and compulsive. The short half-life contributes to a sharp comedown, often marked by irritability, low mood, and insomnia. Oral dosing is more forgiving but still prone to compulsive escalation, while insufflation and intravenous routes amplify both euphoria and cardiovascular strain. Users report appetite suppression, jaw tension, tremor, and persistent tachycardia during sessions. Redosing within the first hour significantly increases cardiovascular and neurotoxic stress, and binges of >24 hours without sleep have led to stimulant psychosis similar to high-dose cocaine. Accurate dosing is critical: pyrovalerone is active at very low milligram amounts, making volumetric liquid measurement safer than weighing single doses. Reagent tests often cannot distinguish pyrovalerone from related pyrrolidinophenones, so confirmation with multiple reagents or advanced analysis (GC-MS, FT-IR) is recommended. For harm reduction, users should pre-weigh a maximum daily session dose, allow full return to baseline before re-dosing, maintain hydration and electrolyte intake (especially potassium and magnesium), and ensure proper sleep hygiene. Because pyrovalerone was quickly replaced by stronger analogues like MDPV and α-PVP on the illicit market, it remains rare but presents similar risks: high addiction potential, strong cardiovascular strain, and rapid tolerance escalation.\",\n-      \"Stimulation\",\n-      \"Increased energy\",\n-      \"Enhanced motivation/productivity\",\n-      \"Euphoria (moderate)\",\n-      \"Empathy & sociability\",\n-      \"Talkativeness\",\n-      \"Sexual arousal & increased libido\",\n-      \"Cognitive stimulation\",\n-      \"Mood lift\",\n-      \"Appetite suppression\",\n-      \"Bruxism / jaw tension\",\n-      \"Vasoconstriction & cold extremities\",\n-      \"Sweating\",\n-      \"Insomnia\",\n-      \"Anxiety (dose-dependent)\",\n-      \"Compulsive redosing\",\n-      \"Visual flicker or mild hallucinations at high doses\",\n-      \"Crash: fatigue & low mood\"\n+      \"clean, functional stimulation\",\n+      \"confidence and motivation boost\",\n+      \"anorexia and dry mouth\",\n+      \"jaw tension, fine tremor\",\n+      \"compulsive redosing drive\",\n+      \"irritability and dysphoria on comedown\"\n-      \"full_tolerance\": \"Develops after 2–3 days of continuous or binge use\",\n-      \"half_tolerance\": \"≈7 days of abstinence\",\n-      \"zero_tolerance\": \"≈2–3 weeks of abstinence\",\n+      \"full_tolerance\": \"after 1-2 heavy sessions\",\n+      \"half_tolerance\": \"3-5 days\",\n+      \"zero_tolerance\": \"10-14 days\",\n-        \"Other cathinones\",\n-        \"Amphetamines\"\n+        \"MDPV\",\n+        \"α-PVP\",\n+        \"other pyrrolidinophenones\"\n-    \"half_life\": \"Estimated 1.5–3 h (plasma);

Its pharmacology shows high affinity inhibition of dopamine and norepinephrine transporters, with negligible serotonin activity, producing a stimulation that is clean but also edgy and compulsive. The short half-life contributes to a sharp comedown, often marked by irritability, low mood, and insomnia. Oral dosing is more forgiving but still prone to compulsive escalation, while insufflation and intravenous routes amplify both euphoria and cardiovascular strain. Users report appetite suppression, jaw tension, tremor, and persistent tachycardia during sessions. Redosing within the first hour significantly increases cardiovascular and neurotoxic stress, and binges of >24 hours without sleep have led to stimulant psychosis similar to high-dose cocaine. Accurate dosing is critical: pyrovalerone is active at very low milligram amounts, making volumetric liquid measurement safer than weighing single doses. Reagent tests often cannot distinguish pyrovalerone from related pyrrolidinophenones, so confirmation with multiple reagents or advanced analysis (GC-MS, FT-IR) is recommended. For harm reduction, users should pre-weigh a maximum daily session dose, allow full return to baseline before re-dosing, maintain hydration and electrolyte intake (especially potassium and magnesium), and ensure proper sleep hygiene. Because pyrovalerone was quickly replaced by stronger analogues like MDPV and α-PVP on the illicit market, it remains rare but presents similar risks: high addiction potential, strong cardiovascular strain, and rapid tolerance escalation.\",\n+    \"notes\": \"Carisoprodol is prescribed only for short-term relief of acute muscle spasm, yet dependence emerges quickly because it metabolises into the sedative meprobamate. Long-term use or abrupt cessation can precipitate significant withdrawal.\\n\\nCarisoprodol is a centrally acting muscle relaxant with sedative and anxiolytic properties, commonly prescribed for short-term treatment of musculoskeletal pain. It is rapidly metabolized in the liver to meprobamate, a long-acting anxiolytic and sedative-hypnotic with its own abuse history, making carisoprodol pharmacologically similar to combining a short-acting sedative with a longer-lasting one. Because of this metabolic pathway, effects may persist longer than expected, especially with repeated dosing. Recreational use often centers around the drug’s sedative euphoria, which some users compare to a mild benzodiazepine, though with a heavier, less controlled sedation and occasional paradoxical stimulation. At therapeutic doses, carisoprodol causes muscle relaxation, drowsiness, and anxiolysis; at higher doses, it can cause confusion, ataxia, double vision, blackouts, and sudden loss of motor control. Abrupt movements or attempts to stand can cause sudden collapses, leading to falls and injuries. Tolerance to the euphoric and relaxing effects develops quickly, encouraging dose escalation and binge-style use. Dependence liability is compounded by meprobamate accumulation, which has a half-life of ~10 hours, leading to more prolonged sedation and risk of withdrawal upon cessation. Withdrawal symptoms can include tremors, anxiety, agitation, insomnia, nausea, hallucinations, and seizures; these can be severe after chronic high-dose use and may require medical supervision, often with benzodiazepine substitution. Mixing carisoprodol with other depressants such as alcohol, opioids, or benzodiazepines greatly increases the risk of respiratory depression, aspiration, coma, and death; many fatalities have involved such polydrug combinations. Recreational users sometimes combine carisoprodol with opioids or benzodiazepines in a cocktail known as the 'Holy Trinity,' which is considered highly dangerous due to synergistic CNS depression. Harm reduction strategies include limiting use to occasional sessions, spacing doses at least 4–6 hours apart, avoiding any other depressants, and never exceeding 700 mg in a single dose. Users should ensure they are in a safe environment before onset due to risk of sudden sedation and falls. Because it is often supplied as tablets with varying imprints, counterfeit risks exist; some tablets may contain other sedatives or opioids, so reagent testing is advised where possible. Long-term heavy use can impair memory, attention, and coordination, and chronic use is discouraged due to rapid tolerance and dependence liability.\",\n-      \"clean, functional stimulation\",\n-      \"confidence and motivation boost\",\n-      \"anorexia and dry mouth\",\n-      \"jaw tension, fine tremor\",\n-      \"compulsive redosing drive\",\n-      \"irritability and dysphoria on comedown\"\n+      \"Muscle relaxation\",\n+      \"Sedation\",\n+      \"Euphoria (in some users)\",\n+      \"Drowsiness\",\n+      \"Dizziness\",\n+      \"Impaired coordination\",\n+      \"Confusion (at high doses)\",\n+      \"Potential for amnesia\"\n-      \"full_tolerance\": \"after 1-2 heavy sessions\",\n-      \"half_tolerance\": \"3-5 days\",\n-      \"zero_tolerance\": \"10-14 days\",\n+      \"full_tolerance\": \"Develops within days to weeks of regular use\",\n+      \"half_tolerance\": \"Several days after cessation\",\n+      \"zero_tolerance\": \"1-2 weeks after cessation\",\n-        \"MDPV\",\n-        \"α-PVP\",\n-        \"other pyrrolidinophenones\"\n+        \"Meprobamate\",\n+        \"Other sedative-hypnotics\"\n-    \"half_life\": \"Approx. 0.3-1.5 h in rats;

Reports describe SNDRI-like alertness with rapid tolerance and highlight the need for accurate dosing and respect for its abuse potential.\\n\\n4-MEPPP (4-methyl-α-pyrrolidinopropiophenone) is a pyrrolidinophenone stimulant related to α-PPP and more distantly to α-PVP/MDPV. In vitro and in vivo work indicates it behaves primarily as a dopamine>norepinephrine reuptake blocker with minimal serotonin releasing activity, yielding a 'cleaner', more dopaminergic stimulation profile than 4-MEC or mephedrone. Intranasal user reports cluster around 20-40 mg per line with fast onset (1-2 min), modest euphoria, talkativeness, mydriasis, and a relatively short window (about 1-2 h of noticeable effects) followed by a mild comedown; 50+ mg in a single line has been described as too intense/panicky by some. Oral doses are less well-documented but appear higher than intranasal on a milligram basis (common 30-60 mg), with slower onset and smoother peak. Several users note a 'ceiling' effect where repeated lines after the first hour add side effects (tachycardia, anxiety) more than benefits; scheduling gaps of 90+ minutes between trials reduces stacking. Market context matters: 4-MEPPP has been found in mixed 'NRG' products and mis-sold as α-PVP; expect inconsistent potency and possible blends. Use multiple reagents (e.g., Marquis, Mecke, Simon’s) and avoid assuming identity from a single color reaction; ideally verify with FT-IR/GC-MS from a drug-checking service. Start low, use a 0.001 g scale, and consider volumetric dosing to achieve <10 mg accuracy when titrating. Redosing loops and sleep loss are the main acute harm vectors: set a hard session cap (e.g., 60-120 mg total depending on ROA), avoid back-to-back days, and plan a sleep window. Hydration and electrolytes (especially potassium/magnesium) help with jaw tension and tremor; light carbohydrates can blunt post-peak edginess. Avoid strenuous activity and hot environments to limit hyperthermia risk, and monitor pulse/temperature during sessions. Combining with other stimulants or MAOIs significantly increases cardiovascular and neurotoxic risk and should be avoided; alcohol adds cardiovascular strain and disinhibition. Intravenous or vaporized routes are strongly discouraged due to unknown pyrolysis products, rapid spike/crash dynamics, and high complication risk; most reported benefits are achievable with intranasal or oral use at much lower risk. Tolerance rises across a binge but tends to reset substantially after 3-5 days off; repeated multi-day runs increase crash dysphoria and insomnia. Because analytical work shows rapid metabolism and detection via characteristic metabolites, drug screens may miss parent compound; however, this does not imply safety. If anxiety or palpitations escalate, stop redosing, hydrate, cool down, and consider non-sedating de-escalation (quiet environment; avoid benzodiazepines unless medically indicated).\",\n-      \"Warm empathy\",\n-      \"Anxiolysis\",\n-      \"Mild euphoria\",\n-      \"Sedation\",\n-      \"Closed-eye visual patterns\",\n-      \"Color enhancement\",\n-      \"Auditory softness/‘music appreciation’\",\n-      \"Dream-like thought loops\",\n-      \"Pupil dilation\",\n-      \"Jaw tension\",\n-      \"Nausea\",\n-      \"Body heaviness\",\n-      \"Vasoconstriction\",\n-      \"Mild dizziness/headache post-use\"\n+      \"alertness and increased talkativeness\",\n+      \"moderate euphoria (short-lived)\",\n+      \"enhanced focus with low–moderate doses\",\n+      \"mydriasis (large pupils)\",\n+      \"appetite suppression and dry mouth\",\n+      \"jaw tension, fine tremor\",\n+      \"anxiety/panic at high doses\",\n+      \"residual stimulation with difficulty sleeping\"\n-      \"full_tolerance\": \"After 2–3 consecutive daily uses\",\n-      \"half_tolerance\": \"~7 days\",\n-      \"zero_tolerance\": \"~14–21 days\",\n+      \"full_tolerance\": \"after 1-2 heavy sessions or a multi-hour binge\",\n+      \"half_tolerance\": \"3-5 days\",\n+      \"zero_tolerance\": \"10-14 days\",\n-        \"MDMA\",\n-        \"mCPP\",\n-        \"TFMPP\",\n-        \"classical psychedelics (partial)\"\n+        \"α-PPP\",\n+        \"α-PVP/MDPV\",\n+        \"other pyrrolidinophenones\",\n+        \"dopamine-selective stimulants\"\n-    \"half_life\": \"Estimated 3–5 h (no formal human PK data; based on animal studies of phenylpiperazines)\",\n+    \"half_life\": \"2-4 hours (subjective window typical); precise human PK not established\",\n-        \"name\": \"TripSit – 4-FPP profile\",\n-        \"reference\": \"https://drugs.tripsit.me/4-fpp\"\n+        \"name\": \"Bluelight – 4-MePPP thread (intranasal doses, onset, user patterns)\",\n+        \"reference\": \"https://www.bluelight.org/community/threads/4-meppp-2-pyrrolidin-1-yl-1-p-tolylpropan-1-one-cas-28117-80-8.604620/\"\n-        \"name\": \"Bluelight discussion: ‘Novel Empathogen: para-Fluorophenylpiperazine’\",\n-        \"reference\": \"https://www.bluelight.org/community/threads/novel-empathogen-para-fluorophenylpiperazine-pfpp-4fpp.821107/\"\n+        \"name\": \"Bluelight – α-PPP discussion (contextual dosing/ROA comparisons within class)\",\n+        \"reference\": \"https://www.bluelight.org/community/threads/4-methyl-alpha-pyrrolidinopropiophenone.372855/\"\n-        \"name\": \"Erowid Experience ID 61761 – ‘pFPP – 60 mg oral’\",\n-        \"reference\": \"https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=61761\"\n+        \"name\": \"Saha et al., 2015 – 4-MEC vs 4-MePPP transporter pharmacology (DAT blocker, minimal SERT substrate activity for 4-MePPP)\",\n+        \"reference\": \"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4397398/\"\n-        \"name\": \"Erowid Experience ID 56641 – ‘pFPP + methylone’\",\n-        \"reference\": \"https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=56641\"\n+        \"name\": \"DEA – Synthetic Cathinones Three-Factor Analysis (4-MePPP animal discrimination/locomotor data)\",\n+        \"reference\": \"https://www.dea.gov/sites/default/files/2020-06/Synthetic%20Cathinones%20-%20Three%20Factor%20Analysis.pdf\"\n-        \"name\": \"EMCDDA.

Reports describe SNDRI-like alertness with rapid tolerance and highlight the need for accurate dosing and respect for its abuse potential.\\n\\n4-MEPPP (4-methyl-α-pyrrolidinopropiophenone) is a pyrrolidinophenone stimulant related to α-PPP and more distantly to α-PVP/MDPV. In vitro and in vivo work indicates it behaves primarily as a dopamine>norepinephrine reuptake blocker with minimal serotonin releasing activity, yielding a 'cleaner', more dopaminergic stimulation profile than 4-MEC or mephedrone. Intranasal user reports cluster around 20-40 mg per line with fast onset (1-2 min), modest euphoria, talkativeness, mydriasis, and a relatively short window (about 1-2 h of noticeable effects) followed by a mild comedown; 50+ mg in a single line has been described as too intense/panicky by some. Oral doses are less well-documented but appear higher than intranasal on a milligram basis (common 30-60 mg), with slower onset and smoother peak. Several users note a 'ceiling' effect where repeated lines after the first hour add side effects (tachycardia, anxiety) more than benefits; scheduling gaps of 90+ minutes between trials reduces stacking. Market context matters: 4-MEPPP has been found in mixed 'NRG' products and mis-sold as α-PVP; expect inconsistent potency and possible blends. Use multiple reagents (e.g., Marquis, Mecke, Simon’s) and avoid assuming identity from a single color reaction; ideally verify with FT-IR/GC-MS from a drug-checking service. Start low, use a 0.001 g scale, and consider volumetric dosing to achieve <10 mg accuracy when titrating. Redosing loops and sleep loss are the main acute harm vectors: set a hard session cap (e.g., 60-120 mg total depending on ROA), avoid back-to-back days, and plan a sleep window. Hydration and electrolytes (especially potassium/magnesium) help with jaw tension and tremor; light carbohydrates can blunt post-peak edginess.

Doses above ~150 mg have produced severe confusion, black-outs, urinary tract irritation similar to ketamine cystitis, and in a few cases hospitalisation. Large crystals are caustic to nasal tissue; oral capsules are preferred. Because of its long half-life, impairment can persist into the following day—avoid driving or safety-critical work for at least 24 h.

Treat it as an MAOI during the session window even though clinical reversibility is not established. Start with a microtest of 0.5-1 mg to gauge sensitivity; community trials report activity at 1-2 mg and full days’ worth of effects from 8-12 mg. Because the come-up is slow and the duration long, redosing is usually unnecessary and can produce a late, heavy body load. Volumetric dosing is strongly advised so that sub-1 mg adjustments are possible; weigh at least 10-20 mg on a 0.001 g scale, dissolve to make 1 mg/mL or 0.5 mg/mL, and measure with an oral syringe. Plan a bland, low-tyramine diet the day of dosing and until baseline the next day (avoid aged cheeses, cured/fermented meats, soy ferments, Marmite, certain beers). Review medications and supplements for serotonergic or MAOI activity; conservative washout rules are prudent (at least 2 weeks after irreversible MAOIs; several days after SSRIs/SNRIs/linezolid/tramadol/DXM/5-HTP). Physiologically, expect mild pupil dilation, warmth, tremor or jaw tension at higher doses, and a gradual shift from entactogenic glow to more psychedelic headspace. Several field reports describe a delayed intensification late in the day; avoid stacking doses based on an early, gentle come-up. Keep the environment cool, hydrate with electrolytes, and avoid vigorous exercise or hot environments. If symptoms suggest serotonin toxicity (agitation, clonus, hyperthermia, severe headache, rapidly rising heart rate/BP), do not take more, cool down, and seek medical care; do not self-medicate with additional serotonergics. Drug-checking is important: 5-Cl-AMT has appeared in small niche markets and could be misrepresented; use multi-reagent testing and, where available, FT-IR/GC-MS. Because reports show long wakefulness and an afterglow that can flip to lethargy, protect sleep the following night and avoid consecutive-day use.

Treat it as an MAOI during the session window even though clinical reversibility is not established. Start with a microtest of 0.5-1 mg to gauge sensitivity; community trials report activity at 1-2 mg and full days’ worth of effects from 8-12 mg. Because the come-up is slow and the duration long, redosing is usually unnecessary and can produce a late, heavy body load. Volumetric dosing is strongly advised so that sub-1 mg adjustments are possible; weigh at least 10-20 mg on a 0.001 g scale, dissolve to make 1 mg/mL or 0.5 mg/mL, and measure with an oral syringe. Plan a bland, low-tyramine diet the day of dosing and until baseline the next day (avoid aged cheeses, cured/fermented meats, soy ferments, Marmite, certain beers). Review medications and supplements for serotonergic or MAOI activity; conservative washout rules are prudent (at least 2 weeks after irreversible MAOIs; several days after SSRIs/SNRIs/linezolid/tramadol/DXM/5-HTP). Physiologically, expect mild pupil dilation, warmth, tremor or jaw tension at higher doses, and a gradual shift from entactogenic glow to more psychedelic headspace. Several field reports describe a delayed intensification late in the day; avoid stacking doses based on an early, gentle come-up. Keep the environment cool, hydrate with electrolytes, and avoid vigorous exercise or hot environments. If symptoms suggest serotonin toxicity (agitation, clonus, hyperthermia, severe headache, rapidly rising heart rate/BP), do not take more, cool down, and seek medical care; do not self-medicate with additional serotonergics. Drug-checking is important: 5-Cl-AMT has appeared in small niche markets and could be misrepresented; use multi-reagent testing and, where available, FT-IR/GC-MS. Because reports show long wakefulness and an afterglow that can flip to lethargy, protect sleep the following night and avoid consecutive-day use. Cross-tolerance with other serotonergic psychedelics is expected; spacing sessions by 10-14 days reduces tolerance and carries a margin for MAO-related interactions.\",\n+    \"notes\": \"Diphenhydramine is widely available over-the-counter and used medically for allergies and sleep aid.
