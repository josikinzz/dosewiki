## Overview

### Description

This compound belongs to the class of organic compounds known as diphenylmethanes. These are compounds containing a diphenylmethane moiety, which consists of a methane wherein two hydrogen atoms are replaced by two phenyl groups.

### Background

Methadone is a potent synthetic analgesic that works as a full µ-opioid receptor (MOR) agonist and N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist. As a full MOR agonist, methadone mimics the natural effects of the body's opioids, endorphins, and enkephalins through the release of neurotransmitters involved in pain transmission. It also has a number of unique characteristics that have led to its increased use in the last two decades; in particular, methadone has a lower risk of neuropsychiatric toxicity compared to other opioids (due to a lack of active metabolites), minimal accumulation in renal failure, good bioavailability, low cost, and a long duration of action.

Due to its unique mechanism of action, methadone is particularly useful for the management of hard to treat pain syndromes such as neuropathic pain and cancer pain requiring higher and more frequent doses of shorter-acting opioids.
15
,
16
,
18
Compared with
morphine
, the gold standard reference opioid, methadone also acts as an agonist of κ- and σ-opioid receptors, as an antagonist of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, and as an inhibitor of serotonin and norepinephrine uptake.
2
,
7
Specifically by inhibiting the NMDA receptor, methadone dampens a major excitatory pain pathway within the central nervous system.
12
Compared to other opioids, methadone's effects on NMDA inhibition may explain it's improved analgesic efficacy and reduced opioid tolerance.
16
,
17
Methadone shares similar effects and risks of other opioids such as
morphine
,
hydromorphone
,
oxycodone
, and
fentanyl
. However, it also has a unique pharmacokinetic profile. Compared with short-acting and even extended-release formulations of
morphine
, methadone displays a comparatively longer duration of action and half-life. These effects make methadone a good option for the treatment of severe pain and addiction as fewer doses are needed to maintain analgesia and prevent opioid withdrawal symptoms. However, methadone also has an unpredictable half-life with interindividual variability, which leads to an unpredictable risk of respiratory depression and overdose when initiating or titrating therapy.
8
Overall, methadone's pharmacological actions result in analgesia, suppression of opioid withdrawal symptoms, sedation, miosis, sweating, hypotension, bradycardia, nausea and vomiting (via binding within the chemoreceptor trigger zone), and constipation. At higher doses, methadone use can result in respiratory depression, overdose, and death.
22
,
23
,
24
Treatment of opioid addiction with methadone,
buprenorphine
, or slow-release oral
morphine
(SROM) is termed Opioid Agonist Treatment (OAT) or Opioid Substitution Therapy (OST). The intention of substitution of illicit opioids with the long-acting opioids used in OAT is to prevent withdrawal symptoms for 24-36 hours following dosing to ultimately reduce cravings and drug-seeking behaviours. Use of OAT is also intended to lead to social stabilization by reducing crime rates, incarceration, use of illicit opioids such as
heroin
or
fentanyl
, and ultimately marginalization.
13
Illegally purchased opioids present many other harms in addition to overdose as they can be injected and may be laced with other substances that increase the risk of harm or overdose. Provision of OAT is often combined with education about harm reduction including use of clean needles and injection supplies in an effort to reduce the risks associated with injection drug use such as contraction of HIV and Hepatitis C and other complications including skin infections, abscesses, or endocarditis.

### Indication

Methadone is indicated for the management of pain severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatment options are inadequate. It's recommended that use is reserved for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options (eg, nonopioid analgesics, opioid combination products) are ineffective, not tolerated, or would be otherwise inadequate to provide sufficient management of pain.
23
Methadone is also indicated for detoxification treatment of opioid addiction (heroin or other morphine-like drugs), and for maintenance substitution treatment for opioid dependence in adults in conjunction with appropriate social and medical services.
22
,
24

### Pharmacodynamics

Overall, methadone's pharmacological actions result in analgesia, suppression of opioid withdrawal symptoms, sedation, miosis (through binding to receptors in the pupillary muscles), sweating, hypotension, bradycardia, nausea and vomiting (via binding within the chemoreceptor trigger zone), and constipation. Like many basic drugs, methadone also enters mast cells and releases histamine by a non-immunological mechanism leading to flushing, pruritus, and urticaria, which can commonly be misattributed to an allergic reaction.
Compared to other opioids, methadone has fewer active metabolites and therefore a lower risk of neuropsychiatric toxicity. This means that higher doses needed to manage severe pain or addiction are less likely to result in delirium, hyperalgesia, or seizures.
19
,
20
Similar to morphine, both methadone isomers are 5-HT(3) receptor antagonists, although l-methadone produces greater inhibition than d-methadone.
Methadone's effects are reversible by naloxone with a pA2 value similar to its antagonism of morphine.
22
,
23
,
24
Dependence and Tolerance
As with other opioids, tolerance and physical dependence may develop upon repeated administration of methadone and there is a potential for development of psychological dependence. Physical dependence and tolerance reflect the neuroadaptation of the opioid receptors to chronic exposure to an opioid and are separate and distinct from abuse and addiction. Tolerance, as well as physical dependence, may develop upon repeated administration of opioids, and are not by themselves evidence of an addictive disorder or abuse.
Patients on prolonged therapy should be tapered gradually from the drug if it is no longer required for pain control. Withdrawal symptoms may occur following abrupt discontinuation of therapy or upon administration of an opioid antagonist. Some of the symptoms that may be associated with abrupt withdrawal of an opioid analgesic include body aches, diarrhea, gooseflesh, loss of appetite, nausea, nervousness or restlessness, anxiety, runny nose, sneezing, tremors or shivering, stomach cramps, tachycardia, trouble with sleeping, unusual increase in sweating, palpitations, unexplained fever, weakness and yawning.
22
,
23
,
24
Cardiac Conduction Effects
Laboratory studies, both in vivo and in vitro, have demonstrated that methadone inhibits cardiac potassium channels and prolongs the QT interval. Cases of QT interval prolongation and serious arrhythmia (torsades de pointes) have been observed during treatment with methadone. These cases appear to be more commonly associated with, but not limited to, higher dose treatment (> 200 mg/day). Methadone should be administered with particular caution to patients already at risk for development of prolonged QT interval (e.g., cardiac hypertrophy, concomitant diuretic use, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia). Careful monitoring is recommended when using methadone in patients with a history of cardiac conduction disease, those taking medications affecting cardiac conduction, and in other cases where history or physical exam suggest an increased risk of dysrhythmia.
22
,
23
,
24
Respiratory Depression and Overdose
Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression may occur with use of methadone. Patients should be
monitored for respiratory depression, especially during initiation of methadone or following a dose increase.
Respiratory depression is of particular concern in elderly or debilitated patients as well as in those suffering from conditions accompanied by hypoxia or hypercapnia when even moderate therapeutic doses may dangerously decrease pulmonary ventilation. Methadone should be administered with extreme caution to patients with conditions accompanied by hypoxia, hypercapnia, or decreased respiratory reserve such as: asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, severe obesity, sleep apnea syndrome, myxedema, kyphoscoliosis, and CNS depression or coma. In these patients, even usual therapeutic doses of methadone may decrease respiratory drive while simultaneously increasing airway resistance to the point of apnea. Alternative, non-opioid analgesics should be considered, and methadone should be employed only under careful medical supervision at the lowest effective dose.
Infants exposed in-utero or through breast milk are at risk of life-threatening respiratory depression upon delivery or when nursed.
Methadone's peak respiratory depressant effects typically occur later, and persist longer than its peak analgesic effects, in the short-term use setting. These characteristics can contribute to cases of iatrogenic overdose, particularly during treatment initiation and dose titration.
22
,
23
,
24
Head Injury and Increased Intracranial Pressure
The respiratory depressant effects of opioids and their capacity to elevate cerebrospinal fluid pressure may be markedly exaggerated in the presence of head injury, other intracranial lesions or a pre-existing increase in intracranial pressure. Furthermore, opioids produce effects which may obscure the clinical course of patients with head injuries. In such patients, methadone must be used with caution, and only if it is deemed essential.
22
,
23
,
24
Incomplete Cross-tolerance between Methadone and other Opioids
Patients tolerant to other opioids may be incompletely tolerant to methadone. Incomplete cross-tolerance is of particular concern for patients tolerant to other µ-opioid agonists who are being converted to methadone, thus making the determination of dosing during opioid conversion complex. Deaths have been reported during conversion from chronic, high-dose treatment with other opioid agonists. A high degree of “opioid tolerance” does not eliminate the possibility of methadone overdose, iatrogenic or otherwise.
22
,
23
,
24
Crosstolerance between morphine and methadone has been demonstrated, as steady-state plasma methadone concentrations required for effectiveness (C50%) were higher in abstinent rats previously dosed with morphine, as compared to controls.
Misuse, Abuse, and Diversion of Opioids
Methadone is a mu-agonist opioid with an abuse liability similar to morphine. Methadone, like morphine and other opioids used for analgesia, has the potential for being abused and is subject to criminal diversion.
Methadone can be abused in a manner similar to other opioid agonists, legal or illicit. This should be considered when dispensing Methadone in situations where the clinician is concerned about an increased risk of misuse, abuse, or diversion.
22
,
23
,
24
Hypotensive Effect
The administration of methadone may result in severe hypotension in patients whose ability to maintain normal blood pressure is compromised (e.g., severe volume depletion).
22
,
23
,
24
Gastrointestinal Effects
Methadone and other morphine-like opioids have been shown to decrease bowel motility and cause constipation. This primarily occurs through agonism of opioid receptors in the gut wall. Methadone may obscure the diagnosis or clinical course of patients with acute abdominal conditions.
22
,
23
,
24
Sexual Function/Reproduction
Reproductive function in human males may be decreased by methadone treatment. Reductions in ejaculate volume and seminal vesicle and prostate secretions have been reported in methadone-treated individuals. In addition, reductions in serum testosterone levels and sperm motility, and abnormalities in sperm morphology have been reported. Long-term use of opioids may be associated with decreased sex hormone levels and symptoms such as low libido, erectile dysfunction, or infertility.

### Absorption

Methadone is one of the more lipid-soluble opioids and is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Following oral administration of methadone, bioavailability ranges from 36-100%, with a marked interindividual variation. It can be detected in blood as soon as 15-45 minutes following administration with peak plasma concentrations achieved between 1 to 7.5 hours. A second peak is observed ~4 hours after administration and is likely due to enterohepatic circulation.  Dose proportionality of methadone pharmacokinetics is not known.
2
,
22
,
23
,
24
Following administration of daily oral doses ranging from 10 to 225 mg the steady-state plasma concentrations ranged between 65 to 630 ng/mL and the peak concentrations ranged between 124 to 1255 ng/mL. Effect of food on the bioavailability of methadone has not been evaluated.
2
,
22
,
23
,
24
Slower absorption is observed in opioid users compared to healthy subjects, which may reflect the pharmacological effect of opioids in slowing gastric emptying and mobility.
2
,
22
,
23
,
24
Due to the large inter-individual variation in methadone pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, treatment should be individualized to each patient. There was an up to 17-fold interindividual variation found in methadone blood concentrations for a given dosage, likely due in part to individual variability in CYP enzyme function.
2
There is also a large variability in pharmacokinetics between methadone's enantiomers, which further complicates pharmacokinetic interpretation and study.
8

### Metabolism

Methadone undergoes fairly extensive first-pass metabolism. Cytochrome P450 enzymes, primarily CYP3A4, CYP2B6, and CYP2C19 and to a lesser extent CYP2C9, CYP2C8, and CYP2D6, are responsible for conversion of methadone to EDDP (2-ethyl-1,5-dimethyl-3,3-diphenylpyrrolidine) and other inactive metabolites, which are excreted mainly in the urine. Methadone first undergoes N-demethylation to form a highly unstable compound that spontaneously converts to EDDP through cyclization and dehydration. EDDP is then converted to 2-ethyl5-methyl-3,3-diphenyl-1-pyrroline (EDMP). Both EDDP and EDMP are inactive.
22
,
24
,
11
The CYP isozymes also demonstrate different affinities for metabolizing the different methadone enantiomers: CYP2C19, CYP3A7, and CYP2C8 preferentially metabolize (R)-methadone while CYP2B6, CYP2D6, and CYP2C18 preferentially metabolize (S)-methadone. CYP3A4 does not have an enantiomer preference.
9
,
11
Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the cytochrome P450 enzymes can impact methadone pharmacokinetics and contribute to the interindividual variation in response to methadone therapy. In particular, CYP2B6 polymorphisms have been shown to impact individual response to methadone as it is the predominant determinant involved in the N-demethylation of methadone, clearance, and the metabolic ratios of [methadone]/[EDDP].
10
The SNPs CYP2B6*6, *9, *11, CYP2C19*2, *3, CYP3A4*1B, and CYP3A5*3 result in increased methadone plasma concentrations, decreased N-demethylation, and decreased methadone clearance, while homozygous carriers of CYP2B6*6/*6 demonstrate diminished metabolism and clearance of methadone.
10
See the pharmacogenomics section for further information.
Pharmacogenomic effects on the CYP enzymes can be significant as the long half-life of methadone can result in some individuals having higher than normal therapeutic levels which puts them at risk of dose-related side effects. For example, elevated (R)-methadone levels can increase the risk of respiratory depression, while elevated (S)-methadone levels can increase the risk of severe cardiac arrhythmias due to prolonged QTc interval.

### Mechanism of action

Methadone is a synthetic opioid analgesic with full agonist activity at the µ-opioid receptor. While agonism of the µ-opioid receptor is the primary mechanism of action for the treatment of pain, methadone also acts as an agonist of κ- and σ-opioid receptors within the central and peripheral nervous systems. Interestingly, methadone differs from
morphine
(which is considered the gold standard reference opioid) in its antagonism of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor and its strong inhibition of serotonin and norepinephrine uptake, which likely also contributes to its antinociceptive activity.
2
Methadone is administered as a 50:50 racemic mixture of (R)- and (S)-stereoisomers, with (R)-methadone demonstrating ~10-fold higher affinity and potency for the µ-opioid receptor than the (S) stereoisomer.
2
The analgesic activity of the racemate is almost entirely due to the (R)-isomer, while the (S)-isomer lacks significant respiratory depressant activity but does have antitussive effects.
While methadone shares similar effects and risks of other opioids such as
morphine
,
hydromorphone
,
oxycodone
, and
fentanyl
it has a number of unique pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties that distinguish it from them and make it a useful agent for the treatment of opioid addiction. For example, methadone abstinence syndrome, although qualitatively similar to that of morphine, differs in that the onset is slower, the course is more prolonged, and the symptoms are less severe.

### Volume of distribution

Due to interindividual differences in pharmacokinetics, estimates of methadone's volume of distribution have ranged from 189-470 L
8
with monographs listing it between 1.0-8.0L/kg.
22
,
23
,
24
As this is higher than physiological volumes of total body water, methadone is highly distributed in the body including brain, gut, kidney, liver, muscle, and lung. A population pharmacokinetic study found that subject gender and weight explained ~33% of the variance in the apparent volume of distribution of methadone.
2
,
24
Methadone is found to be secreted in saliva, sweat, breast milk, amniotic fluid and umbilical cord plasma. The concentration in cord blood is about half the maternal levels.
24

### Protein binding

Methadone is highly bound to plasma proteins. While it primarily binds to α1-acid glycoprotein (85-90%), it also binds to albumin and other tissue and plasma proteins including lipoproteins. Methadone is unusual in the opioid class, in that there is extensive binding to tissue proteins and fairly slow transfer between some parts of this tissue reservoir and the plasma.
2
,
24
,
11

### Route of elimination

The elimination of methadone is mediated by extensive biotransformation, followed by renal and fecal excretion. Unmetabolized methadone and its metabolites are excreted in urine to a variable degree.

### Clearance

Due to interindividual differences in pharmacokinetics, estimates of methadone's clearance have ranged from 5.9–13 L/h hours
8
with approved monographs listing it between 1.4 to 126 L/h.

Methadone
 
Legal Status
 
by Erowid
 
U.S. FEDERAL LAW #
 
Caution : All legal information should be verified through other sources. [ see below ]
 
**U.S. FEDERAL LEGAL SUMMARY**
**Methadone**
- REGULATED: Yes
- STATUS: Scheduled
- SCHEDULE: Schedule II
- CLASSIFICATION: Opiate
 
Methadone is Schedule II in the United States. This means it is illegal to sell without a DEA license and illegal to buy or possess without a license or prescription. 
 
 Methadone may be prescribed for pain in the U.S. as well as a treatment for drug addiction. Methadone used for detoxification can only be prescribed and administered by licensed clinics where patients are usually given methadone in liquid to be taken while watched by the dispensing nurse. 
 
 Starting January 2008, at the DEA's request, manufacturers of 40 mg methadone tablets will only sell to faclities registered to do drug detoxification and maintenance. See [DEA Advisory](http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/pubs/pressrel/methadone_advisory.htm) . 
 
 On May 22, 2008, the DEA issued a Final Rule in the Federal Register increasing the number of patients a clinic can prescribe controlled substances (such as methadone or buprenorphine) to for the purposes of "maintenance or detoxification". Prior to this new rule, the maximum number of patients was 30 and has been raised to 100. Drug treatment practitioners must notify the Secretary of Health and Human Services in order to qualify under this rule. See [Federal Register: May 22, 2008 (Volume 73, Number 100)](http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/2008/E8-11471.htm) .
 
INTERNATIONAL LAW #
 
Canada #
 
Methadone is Schedule II in Canada. This means it is illegal to sell without a license and illegal to buy or possess without a license or prescription. Methadone prescriptions can only be obtained by from a licensed doctor in a "Methadone Clinic". The "Clinic" and very few other Pharmacies can dispense Methadone. You must drink your "Juice" in front of a pharmacist and talk to him/her after you drink to make sure you've swallowed it. It is very hard to get Methadone from "dealers" on the street as most people on Methadone need it to help with the withdrawal and are very reluctant to give it up. (unconfirmed) (thanks SP)
 
France #
 
Methadone is an [Annexe I](http://afssaps.sante.fr/htm/10/pharma/listup.htm) medication in France. This means it is illegal to sell without a license and illegal to buy or possess without a license or prescription. Prescription methadone is strictly controlled. (thanks Mat)
 
Germany #
 
Methadone is BTM Anlage 3 in Germany making it illegal to possess without a BTM prescription. (unconfirmed) (thanks PM)
 
Italy (Italia) #
 
Listed in Tabella I of "Tabelle delle sostanze stupefacenti e psicotrope", making it illegal to possess, purchase, or sell. (see [Tabelle delle sostanze stupefacenti e psicotrope](http://www.salute.gov.it/portale/temi/p2_6.jsp?id=3729&area=sostanzeStupefacenti&menu=vuoto) . (thanks a) (last updated Dec 16, 2015)
 
Portugal #
 
Effective July 2001, personal use of methadone was decriminalized by Law 30/2000 (see [text of law](https://erowid.org/psychoactives/law/countries/portugal/lei30-2000.pdf) ). Possession of less than 1 g is not regarded as a criminal offense, though the substance is liable to be seized and the possessor can be referred to mandatory treatment. Sale, or possession of quantities greater than the personal possession limit, are criminal offenses punishable by jail time. (thanks P)
 
United Kingdom #
 
Methadone is a Class A controlled substance in the UK, making it illegal to buy, sell, or possess. It may be legally prescribed for opiate dependency. An Erowid reader reports that methadone is readily available on the illicit market in London. (thanks KC)

It is strongly discouraged to combine these substances, particularly in [common](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Common) to [heavy](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Heavy) doses.
**Methadone** (sold under trade names such as **Dolophine** and **Methadose** ) is a synthetic [opioid](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioid) [analgesic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pain_relief) used for the treatment of moderate to severe pain and for the treatment of opioid addiction. It is commonly used to treat and manage the symptoms of opioid addiction. The subjective effects are similar to those of other synthetic opioids such as [fentanyl](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Fentanyl) , however, most users note a significantly stronger euphoria. Like [dextropropoxyphene](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dextropropoxyphene) , the use of methadone is associated with cardiac arrhythmia, however it is more common with dextropropoxyphene than it is with methadone.

## Chemistry

Methadone is an opioid of the diphenylpropylamine class, featuring two phenyl rings attached to carbon R 4 of the main 2-oxo-6-dimethylaminoheptane chain. It exists as a racemic mixture of both dextromethadone and levomethadone. It is also similar in structure to [tapentadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tapentadol) and [dextropropoxyphene](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dextropropoxyphene) .

Methadone and its major metabolite, 2-ethylidene-1,5-dimethyl-3,3-diphenylpyrrolidine (EDDP), are often measured in urine as part of a drug abuse testing program, in plasma or serum to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized victims, or in whole blood to assist in a forensic investigation of a traffic or other criminal violation or a case of sudden death. Methadone usage history is considered in interpreting the results as a chronic user can develop tolerance to doses that would incapacitate an opioid-naive individual. Chronic users often have high methadone and EDDP baseline values.

The protonated form of methadone takes on an extended conformation, while the free base is more compact. In particular, it was found that there is an interaction between the tertiary amine and the carbonyl carbon of the ketone function (R 3 N ••• >C=O) that limits the molecule's conformation freedom, though the distance (291 pm by X-ray) is far too long to represent a true chemical bond. However, it does represent the initial trajectory of attack of an amine on a carbonyl group and was an important piece of experimental evidence for the proposal of the Bürgi–Dunitz angle for carbonyl addition reactions.

## Pharmacology

[Opioids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioid) exert their effects by binding to and activating the [μ-opioid](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioid#Mu_.28.CE.BC.29) [receptor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Receptor) . This occurs because opioids structurally mimic endogenous endorphins which are naturally found within the body and also work upon the μ-opioid receptor set. The way in which opioids structurally mimic these natural endorphins results in their [euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria) , [pain relief](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pain_relief) and [anxiolytic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiolytic) effects. This is because endorphins are responsible for reducing pain, causing sleepiness, and feelings of pleasure. They can be released in response to pain, strenuous exercise, orgasm, or general excitement. The bioavailability of orally administered methadone can vary from 40% to around 99%. Methadone is metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system.

Unlike most opioids, methadone is a weak serotonin reuptake inhibitor as well as a weak NMDA antagonist. Similarly to [dextropropoxyphene](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dextropropoxyphene) , methadone is a nicotinic [acetylcholine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Acetylcholine) [receptor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Receptor) [antagonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antagonist) .

The metabolic half life of methadone differs from its duration of action. The metabolic half life is 8 to 59 hours (approximately 24 hours for opioid-tolerant people, and 55 hours in opioid-naive people), as opposed to a half life of 1 to 5 hours for morphine. The length of the half life of methadone allows for exhibition of respiratory depressant effects for an extended duration of time in opioid-naive people.

Levomethadone (the *L* enantiomer) is a μ-opioid receptor agonist with higher intrinsic activity than morphine, but lower affinity. Dextromethadone (the *S* enantiomer) does not affect opioid receptors but binds to the glutamatergic NMDA ( *N* -methyl-D-aspartate) receptor, and acts as an antagonist against glutamate. Methadone has been shown to reduce neuropathic pain, primarily through NMDA receptor antagonism. Glutamate is the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. Acting as an NMDA antagonist may be one mechanism by which methadone decreases craving for opioids and tolerance, and has been proposed as a possible mechanism for its distinguished efficacy regarding the treatment of neuropathic pain.

Methadone also acted as a potent, noncompetitive α 3 β 4 neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist in rat receptors, expressed in human embryonic kidney cell lines.

### Binding affinities (Ki)

Dextromethadone:

- Mu opioid agonist - 24.8 nM
- Kappa opioid agonist - 543 nM
- Delta opioid agonist - 1674 nM

According to a study published in the [Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics](https://jpet.aspetjournals.org/search/levomethadone) , the dissociation constants (Kd) of Levomethadone at the different opioid receptors are as follows:

- Mu opioid agonist - 2.5 nM
- Kappa opioid agonist - 54 nM
- Delta opioid agonist - 97nM

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- The general sensation of methadone can be described as one of immense euphoria, relaxation, anxiety suppression and pain relief. 
- **[Sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation)** - This leads to the trademark "nodding off" effect, but it is usually milder compared to that of [diacetylmorphine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Diacetylmorphine) (heroin)
- **[Pain relief](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pain_relief)**
- **[Physical euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria)** - This particular substance can be considered moderately intense, more commonly with the L-enantiomer, in its physical euphoria when compared with that of [morphine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Morphine) or [diacetylmorphine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Diacetylmorphine) (heroin), and definitely stronger than that of other synthetic opioids such as [tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol) . The sensation itself can be described as extreme feelings of intense physical comfort, extreme warmth, love and bliss.
- **[Itchiness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Itchiness)**
- **[Respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression)** - At low to moderate doses, this effect results in the sensation that the breath is slowed down mildly to moderately, but does not cause noticeable impairment. At high doses and overdoses, opioid-induced respiratory depression can result in a shortness of breath, abnormal breathing patterns, semi-consciousness, or unconsciousness. Severe overdoses can result in a coma or death without immediate medical attention.
- **[Constipation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Constipation)**
- **[Cough suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cough_suppression)**
- **[Difficulty urinating](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Difficulty_urinating)**
- **[Nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea)**
- **[Sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation)**
- **[Pupil constriction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pupil_constriction)**
- **[Decreased libido](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Decreased_libido)**
- **[Appetite suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Appetite_suppression)**
- **[Orgasm suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Orgasm_suppression)**
- **[Abnormal heartbeat](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Abnormal_heartbeat)** - A rare but potentially fatal side effect of methadone's potential to prolong the QT interval. Torsades de pointes is an abnormal heart rhythm which can lead to sudden cardiac death. ### Cognitive effects
 
- - **[Cognitive euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_euphoria)** - This particular substance can be considered as less intense in its cognitive euphoria when compared with that of [morphine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Morphine) or [diacetylmorphine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Diacetylmorphine) (heroin), but the L-enantiomer (levomethadone) is way stronger and can be considered almost equal to [diacetylmorphine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Diacetylmorphine) . Both enantiomers, ultimately, are stronger than other synthetic opioids such as [tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol) . The sensation itself can be described as powerful and overwhelming feeling of emotional bliss, contentment and happiness.
- **[Anxiety suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety_suppression)**
- **[Compulsive redosing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Compulsive_redosing)**
- **[Dream potentiation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dream_potentiation)** ### Visual effects
 
- #### Suppressions
 
- **[Double vision](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Double_vision)** - At high doses, the eyes un-focus and re-focus uncontrollably. It appears to be caused by issues in depth perception, as by closing one eye the issue can be temporarily alleviated.
 
#### Hallucinatory states
 
- **[Internal hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucination)** - One may experience a state of semi-consciousness and [hypnagogia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hypnagogia) during heavy dosage nodding which results in dream-like states and up to level 3 [imagery](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Lucid_dreaming#Internally_sourced_sensory_input) . This is often accompanied by ill-defined [geometry](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Geometry) .
### Experience reports

There are currently no anecdotal reports which describe the effects of this compound within our [experience index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Experience_index) . Additional experience reports can be found here:

- [Erowid Experience Vaults: Methadone](https://www.erowid.org/experiences/subs/exp_Methadone.shtml)

## Toxicity and harm potential

Methadone has a moderate toxicity relative to dose. As with all opioids, long-term effects can vary but can include diminished libido, apathy and memory loss. It is also potentially [lethal](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression) when mixed with [depressants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressants) like [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) or [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) and generally has a wider range of substances which it is [dangerous to combine with](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methadone#Dangerous_interactions) in comparison to other opioids. Methadone is known to lower the seizure threshold. It should not be taken during [benzodiazepine withdrawals](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine#Discontinuation) as this can potentially cause [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizure) .

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this drug.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

As with other [opioids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioids) , the chronic use of methadone can be considered extremely addictive with a high potential for abuse and is capable of causing psychological dependence among certain users. When addiction has developed, cravings and [withdrawal symptoms](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioids#Discontinuation) may occur if a person suddenly stops their usage.

Tolerance to many of the effects of methadone develops with prolonged and repeated use. The rate at which this occurs develops at different rates for different effects, with tolerance to the constipation-inducing effects developing particularly slowly for instance. This results in users having to administer increasingly large doses to achieve the same effects. After that, it takes about 3 - 7 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 1 - 2 weeks to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). Methadone presents cross-tolerance with all other [opioids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioids) , meaning that after the consumption of methadone all [opioids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioid) will have a reduced effect.

The risk of fatal opioid overdoses rise sharply after a period of cessation and [relapse](/w/index.php?title=Relapse&action=edit&redlink=1) , largely because of reduced tolerance. To account for this lack of tolerance, it is safer to only dose a fraction of one's usual [dosage](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dosage) if relapsing. It has also been found that the environment one is in can play a role in opioid tolerance. In one scientific study, rats with the same history of heroin administration were significantly more likely to die after receiving their dose in an environment not associated with the drug in contrast to a familiar environment.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **Alcohol** - Both substances potentiate the ataxia and sedation caused by the other and can lead to unexpected loss of consciousness at high doses. Place affected patients in the recovery position to prevent vomit aspiration from excess. Memory blackouts are likely
- **Stimulants** - Stimulants increase respiration rate which allows for a higher dose of opiates than would otherwise be used. If the stimulant wears off first then the opiate may overcome the user and cause respiratory arrest.
- **Benzodiazepines** - Central nervous system and/or respiratory-depressant effects may be additively or synergistically present. The two substances potentiate each other strongly and unpredictably, very rapidly leading to unconsciousness. While unconscious, vomit aspiration is a risk if not placed in the recovery position blackouts/memory loss likely.
- **DXM** - Generally considered to be toxic. CNS depression, difficulty breathing, heart issues, and liver toxicity have been observed. Additionally if one takes DXM, their tolerance of opiates goes down slightly, thus causing additional synergistic effects.
- **GHB** / **GBL** - The two substances potentiate each other strongly and unpredictably, very rapidly leading to unconsciousness. While unconscious, vomit aspiration is a risk if not placed in the recovery position
- **Ketamine** - Both substances bring a risk of vomiting and unconsciousness. If the user falls unconscious while under the influence there is a severe risk of vomit aspiration if they are not placed in the recovery position.
- **MAOIs** - Coadministration of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) with certain opioids has been associated with rare reports of severe adverse reactions. There appear to be two types of interaction, an excitatory and a depressive one. Symptoms of the excitatory reaction may include agitation, headache, diaphoresis, hyperpyrexia, flushing, shivering, myoclonus, rigidity, tremor, diarrhea, hypertension, tachycardia, seizures, and coma. Death has occurred in some cases.
- **MXE** - MXE can potentiate the effects of opioids but also increases the risk of respiratory depression and organ toxicity.
- **Nitrous** - Both substances potentiate the ataxia and sedation caused by the other and can lead to unexpected loss of consciousness at high doses. While unconscious, vomit aspiration is a risk if not placed in the recovery position. Memory blackouts are common.
- **PCP** - PCP may reduce opioid tolerance, increasing the risk of overdose.
- **Tramadol** - Increased risk of seizures. Tramadol itself is known to induce seizures and it may have additive effects on seizure threshold with other opioids. Central nervous system- and/or respiratory-depressant effects may be additively or synergistically present.
- **Grapefruit** - While grapefruit is not psychoactive, it may affect the metabolism of certain opioids. Tramadol, oxycodone, and fentanyl are all primarily metabolized by the enzyme CYP3A4, which is potently inhibited by grapefruit juice . This may cause the drug to take longer to clear from the body. it may increase toxicity with repeated doses. Methadone may also be affected . Codeine and hydrocodone are metabolized by CYP2D6. People who are on medicines that inhibit CYP2D6, or that lack the enzyme due to a genetic mutation will not respond to codeine as it can not be metabolized into its active product: morphine.

- **[Psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic)** - Methadone is known to lower the seizure threshold [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] and psychedelics may act as triggers for seizures in those who are susceptible to them.

#### Serotonin syndrome risk

While methadone has been reported to occasionally cause serotonin syndrome when combined with certain substances (such as those listed below), anecdotal reports suggests that it does so at a much lower rate than [tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol) . Combinations with the following substances can cause dangerously high [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) levels. [Serotonin syndrome](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome) requires immediate medical attention and can be fatal if left untreated.

- **MAOIs** - Such as [banisteriopsis caapi](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Banisteriopsis_caapi) , [syrian rue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Syrian_rue) , phenelzine, selegiline, and moclobemide.
- **Serotonin releasers** - Such as [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) , [4-FA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-FA) , [methamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) , [methylone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylone) and [αMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/%CE%91MT) .
- **SSRIs** - Such as citalopram and sertraline
- **[SNRIs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SNRIs)** - Such as [tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol) and venlafaxine
- **5-HTP**

Methadone is a synthetic opioid. 
It is most commonly used as a form of maintenance therapy or to help in detox, in people with dependence to opioids. 

## History

Methadone was developed in Germany in 1937 by Gustav Ehrhart and Max Bockmühl, that could be created with readily available precursors. 

On September 11, 1941 Bockmühl and Ehrhart filed an application for a patent for a synthetic substance they called Polamidon, and whose structure had only a slight relation to morphine or other opiate alkaloids. It was brought to market in 1944 and was widely used by the German army during WWII. 

Methadone was introduced into the United States in 1947 by Eli Lilly and Company, as an analgesic under the trade name Dolophine. 

## Dosage

| Light | 3-5 mg |
| --- | --- |
| Common | 5-15 mg |
| Strong | 15-30 mg+ |

NOTE: Do not stack this with more Methadone, as this substance takes fairly long to peak.

## Duration

| Onset | 45-90 minutes |
| --- | --- |
| Total | 6-12 hours |

## Effects

### Positive

- Euphoria

- Constipation

- CNS depression

- Drowsiness

- Hot/cold flashes

- Dizziness

- Vomiting

- Urinary retention (difficulty urinating)

## Harm Reduction

- Do not drive or operate heavy machinery.

## Legal Status

- UK: Class A. (Illegal to produce, supply, or possess)

- United States: Schedule II (Illegal without a prescription)`,
  "wikipedia": `# Methadone
*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methadone*

Methadone, sold under the brand names Dolophine and Methadose among others, is a synthetic opioid used medically to treat chronic pain and opioid use disorder. Prescribed for daily use, the medicine relieves cravings and opioid withdrawal symptoms. Withdrawal management using methadone can be accomplished in less than a month, or it may be done gradually over a longer period of time, or simply maintained for the rest of the patient's life. While a single dose has a rapid effect, maximum effect can take up to five days of use. After long-term use, in people with normal liver function, effects last 8 to 36 hours. Methadone is usually taken by mouth and rarely by injection into a muscle or vein.
Side effects are similar to those of other opioids. These frequently include dizziness, sleepiness, nausea, vomiting, and sweating. Serious risks include opioid abuse and respiratory depression. Abnormal heart rhythms may also occur due to a prolonged QT interval. The number of deaths in the United States involving methadone poisoning declined from 4,418 in 2011 to 3,300 in 2015. Risks are greater with higher doses. Methadone is made by chemical synthesis and acts on opioid receptors.
Methadone was developed in Germany in the late 1930s by Gustav Ehrhart and Max Bockmühl. It was approved for use as an analgesic in the United States in 1947, and has been used in the treatment of addiction since the 1960s. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines.

## Medical uses

### Opioid addiction

Methadone is used for the treatment of opioid use disorder.
It may be used as maintenance therapy or in shorter periods to manage opioid withdrawal symptoms. Its use for the treatment of addiction is usually strictly regulated. In the US, outpatient treatment programs must be certified by the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) and registered by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) to prescribe methadone for opioid addiction.
A 2009 Cochrane review found methadone was effective in retaining people in treatment and the reduction or cessation of heroin use as measured by self-report and urine/hair analysis and did not affect criminal activity or risk of death.
Treatment of opioid-dependent persons with methadone follows one of two routes: maintenance or withdrawal management. Methadone maintenance therapy (MMT) usually takes place in outpatient settings. It is usually prescribed as a single daily dose medication for those who wish to abstain from illicit opioid use. Treatment models for MMT differ. It is not uncommon for treatment recipients to be administered methadone in a specialized clinic, where they are observed for around 15–20 minutes post-dosing, to reduce the risk of diversion of medication.
The duration of methadone treatment programs ranges from a few months to years. Given opioid dependence is characteristically a chronic relapsing/remitting disorder, MMT may be lifelong. The length of time a person remains in treatment depends on a number of factors. While starting doses may be adjusted based on the amount of opioids reportedly used, most clinical guidelines suggest doses start low (e.g., at doses not exceeding 40 mg daily) and are incremented gradually. It has been found that doses of 40 mg per day were sufficient to help control the withdrawal symptoms but not enough to curb the cravings for the drug. Doses of 80 to 100 mg per day have shown higher rates of success in patients and less illicit heroin use during the maintenance therapy. However, higher doses do put a patient more at risk for overdose than a moderately low dose (e.g. 20 mg/day).
Methadone maintenance has been shown to reduce the transmission of bloodborne viruses associated with opioid injection, such as hepatitis B and C, and/or HIV. The principal goals of methadone maintenance are to relieve opioid cravings, suppress the abstinence syndrome, and block the euphoric effects associated with opioids.
Chronic methadone dosing will eventually lead to neuroadaptation, characterised by tolerance and dependence. However, when used correctly in treatment, maintenance therapy is medically safe, non-sedating, and can provide a slow recovery from opioid addiction. Methadone has been widely used for pregnant women addicted to opioids.

### Pain

Methadone is used as an analgesic in chronic pain, often in rotation with other opioids. Due to its activity at the NMDA receptor, it may be more effective against neuropathic pain; for the same reason, tolerance to the analgesic effects may be less than that of other opioids.

## Adverse effects

Adverse effects of methadone include:

Sedation
Constipation
Flushing
Perspiration
Heat intolerance
Dizziness or fainting
Weakness
Fatigue
Drowsiness
Constricted pupils
Dry mouth
Nausea and vomiting
Low blood pressure
Headache
Heart problems such as chest pain or fast heartbeat
Abnormal heart rhythms
Respiratory problems such as trouble breathing, slow or shallow breathing (hypoventilation), lightheadedness, or fainting
Weight gain
Memory loss
Itching
Difficulty urinating
Swelling of the hands, arms, feet, and legs
Mood changes, (e.g., euphoria, disorientation)
Blurred vision
Decreased libido, difficulty in reaching orgasm, or impotence
Missed menstrual periods
Skin rash
Central sleep apnea

### Withdrawal symptoms

Methadone withdrawal symptoms are reported as being significantly more protracted than withdrawal from opioids with shorter half-lives.
When used for opioid maintenance therapy, Methadone is generally administered as an oral liquid. Methadone has been implicated in contributing to significant tooth decay. Methadone causes dry mouth, reducing the protective role of saliva in preventing decay. Other putative mechanisms of methadone-related tooth decay include craving for carbohydrates related to opioids, poor dental care, and a general decrease in personal hygiene. These factors, combined with sedation, have been linked to the causation of extensive dental damage.

Tearing of the eyes
Mydriasis (dilated pupils)
Photophobia (sensitivity to light)
Hyperventilation (breathing that is too fast/deep)
Runny nose

Fever
Sweating
Chills
Tremors
Akathisia (restlessness)
Tachycardia (fast heartbeat)
Aches and pains, often in the joints or legs
Elevated pain sensitivity
Blood pressure that is too high (hypertension, may cause a stroke)

#### Cognitive symptoms

Suicidal ideation
Susceptibility to cravings
Depression
Spontaneous orgasm
Prolonged insomnia
Delirium
Auditory hallucinations
Visual hallucinations
Increased perception of odors (olfaction), real or imagined
Marked increase in sex drive
Agitation
Anxiety
Panic disorder
Nervousness
Paranoia

Apathy
Anorexia (symptom)

### Black box warning

Methadone has the following U.S. FDA black box warning:

Risk of addiction and abuse
Potentially fatal respiratory depression
Lethal overdose in accidental ingestion
QT prolongation
Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome in children of pregnant women
CYP450 drug interactions
Risks when used with alcohol, benzodiazepines, and other CNS depressants.
A certified opioid treatment program is required under federal law (42 CFR 8.12) when dispensing methadone for the treatment of opioid addiction.

### Overdose

Most people who overdose on methadone show some of the following symptoms:

Miosis (constricted pupils)

The respiratory depression of an overdose can be treated with naloxone. Naloxone is preferred to the newer, longer-acting antagonist naltrexone. Despite methadone's much longer duration of action compared to heroin and other shorter-acting agonists and the need for repeat doses of the antagonist naloxone, it is still used for overdose therapy. As naltrexone has a longer half-life, it is more difficult to titrate. If too large a dose of the opioid antagonist is given to a dependent person, it will result in withdrawal symptoms (possibly severe). When using naloxone, the naloxone will be quickly eliminated and the withdrawal will be short-lived. Doses of methadone take longer to be eliminated from the person's system. A common problem in treating methadone overdoses is that given the short action of naloxone (versus the extremely longer-acting methadone), a dosage of naloxone given to a methadone-overdosed person will initially work to bring the person out of overdose, but once the naloxone wears off, if no further naloxone is administered, the person can go right back into overdose (based upon time and dosage of the methadone ingested).

### Tolerance and dependence

As with other opioid medications, tolerance and dependence usually develop with repeated doses. There is some clinical evidence that tolerance to analgesia is less with methadone compared to other opioids; this may be due to its activity at the NMDA receptor. Tolerance to the different physiological effects of methadone varies; tolerance to analgesic properties may or may not develop quickly, but tolerance to euphoria usually develops rapidly, whereas tolerance to constipation, sedation, and respiratory depression develops slowly (if ever).

### Driving

Methadone treatment may impair driving ability. Drug abusers had significantly more involvement in serious crashes than non-abusers in a study by the University of Queensland. In the study of a group of 220 drug abusers, most of them poly-drug abusers, 17 were involved in crashes killing people, compared with a control group of other people randomly selected having no involvement in fatal crashes. However, there have been multiple studies verifying the ability of methadone maintenance patients to drive. In the UK, persons who are prescribed oral methadone can continue to drive after they have satisfactorily completed an independent medical examination which will include a urine screen for drugs. The license will be issued for 12 months at a time and even then, only following a favourable assessment from their own doctor. Individuals who are prescribed methadone for either IV or IM administration cannot drive in the UK, mainly due to the increased sedation effects that this route of use can cause.

### Mortality

In the United States, deaths linked to methadone more than quadrupled in the five-year period between 1999 and 2004. According to the U.S. National Center for Health Statistics, as well as a 2006 series in the Charleston Gazette (West Virginia), medical examiners listed methadone as contributing to 3,849 deaths in 2004. That number was up from 790 in 1999. Approximately 82 percent of those deaths were listed as accidental, and most deaths involved combinations of methadone with other drugs (especially benzodiazepines).
Although deaths from methadone are on the rise, methadone-associated deaths are not being caused primarily by methadone intended for methadone treatment programs, according to a panel of experts convened by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, which released a report titled "Methadone-Associated Mortality, Report of a National Assessment". The consensus report concludes that "although the data remains incomplete, National Assessment meeting participants concurred that methadone tablets or Diskets distributed through channels other than opioid treatment programs most likely are the central factors in methadone-associated mortality."
In 2006, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued a caution about methadone, titled "Methadone Use for Pain Control May Result in Death." The FDA also revised the drug's package insert. The change deleted previous information about the usual adult dosage. The Charleston Gazette reported, "The old language about the 'usual adult dose' was potentially deadly, according to pain specialists."

## Pharmacology

Methadone acts by binding to the μ-opioid receptor, but also has some affinity for the NMDA receptor, an ionotropic glutamate receptor. Methadone is metabolized by CYP3A4, CYP2B6, CYP2D6, and is a substrate, or in this case target, for the P-glycoprotein efflux protein, a protein which helps pump foreign substances out of cells, in the intestines and brain. The bioavailability and elimination half-life of methadone are subject to substantial interindividual variability. Its main route of administration is oral. Adverse effects include sedation, hypoventilation, constipation, and miosis, in addition to tolerance, dependence, and withdrawal difficulties. The withdrawal period can be much more prolonged than with other opioids, spanning anywhere from two weeks to several months.
The metabolic half-life of methadone differs from its duration of action. The metabolic half-life is 8 to 59 hours (approximately 24 hours for opioid-tolerant people, and 55 hours for opioid-naive people), as opposed to a half-life of 1 to 5 hours for morphine. The length of the half-life of methadone allows for the exhibition of respiratory depressant effects for an extended duration of time in opioid-naive people.
Methadone at therapeutic concentrations is known to prolong the QTc interval, which indicates that the heart muscle repolarizes more slowly. This QTc prolongation tends to increase the risk of torsades de pointes (TdP), a heart rhythm disturbance that can lead to syncope or sudden death. In a large observational study in Sweden, methadone was associated with a particularly high incidence of TdP, especially in younger patients. The incidence of TdP was 41.9 cases per 100,000 users of methadone in the 18-64 year old age group. In this study of TdP, methadone was the highest-risk drug in the 18-64 year-old group, with the sole exception of the antiarrhythmic drug amiodarone, which was associated with 66.5 cases of TdP per 100,000 amiodarone users. The high incidence of TdP in amiodarone-treated patients may indicate correlation and not causation because amiodarone is often prescribed to patients with preexisting heart conditions that independently increase the risk of TdP. Methadone likely causes cardiac arrhythmias (such as TdP) via two mechanisms. Like many other cardiotoxic drugs, methadone blocks the hERG K+ channel. The two enantiomers of methadone inhibit hERG channels with different potency. Dextromethadone, which is less potent as an opioid, is more potent at blocking the hERG channel with an IC50 of ~12 μM. Levomethadone has a lower affinity, with an IC50 of ~29 μM at the hERG channel. Methadone is also known to block the Nav1.5 voltage-gated Na+ channel (SCN5A) with an IC50 of ~10 μM, which is similar to the local anesthetic bupivacaine. Both enantiomers of methadone block the Nav1.5 channel with similar affinities. Bupivacaine is especially cardiotoxic among local anesthetics, and it is believed to act via this same sodium channel. Plasma concentrations of methadone in recovering addicts can reach 4 μM during therapy, so the actions of methadone at both the hERG potassium channel and the Nav1.5 sodium channel are possibly clinically relevant in producing cardiac side effects. This also suggests that levomethadone is not completely free of cardiac toxicity.

### Mechanism of action

Levomethadone (the R-(–)-methadone enantiomer) is a μ-opioid receptor agonist with higher intrinsic activity than morphine, but lower affinity. Dextromethadone (the S-(+)-methadone enantiomer) has a much lower affinity to the μ-opioid receptor than levomethadone. Both enantiomers bind to the glutamatergic NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor, acting as noncompetitive antagonists. Methadone has been shown to reduce neuropathic pain in rat models, primarily through NMDA receptor antagonism. NMDA antagonists such as dextromethorphan, ketamine, tiletamine and ibogaine are being studied for their role in decreasing the development of tolerance to opioids and as possible for eliminating addiction/tolerance/withdrawal, possibly by disrupting memory circuitry. Acting as an NMDA antagonist may be one mechanism by which methadone decreases craving for opioids and tolerance, and has been proposed as a possible mechanism for its distinguished efficacy regarding the treatment of neuropathic pain. Methadone also acted as a potent, noncompetitive α3β4 neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist in rat receptors, expressed in human embryonic kidney cell lines.

### Metabolism

Methadone has a slow metabolism and very high fat solubility, making it longer lasting than morphine-based drugs. Methadone has a typical elimination half-life of 15 to 60 hours with a mean of around 22. However, metabolism rates vary greatly between individuals, up to a factor of 100, ranging from as few as 4 hours to as many as 130 hours, or even 190 hours. This variability is apparently due to genetic variability in the production of the associated cytochrome enzymes CYP3A4, CYP2B6 and CYP2D6. Many substances can also induce, inhibit or compete with these enzymes further affecting (sometimes dangerously) methadone half-life. A longer half-life frequently allows for administration only once a day in opioid withdrawal management and maintenance programs. People who metabolize methadone rapidly, on the other hand, may require twice daily dosing to obtain sufficient symptom alleviation while avoiding excessive peaks and troughs in their blood concentrations and associated effects. This can also allow lower total doses in some such people. The analgesic activity is shorter than the pharmacological half-life; dosing for pain control usually requires multiple doses per day normally dividing daily dosage for administration at 8-hour intervals.
The main metabolic pathway involves N-demethylation by CYP3A4 in the liver and intestine to give 2-ethylidene-1,5-dimethyl-3,3-diphenylpyrrolidine (EDDP). This inactive product, as well as the inactive 2-ethyl-5-methyl-3,3-diphenyl-1-pyrroline (EMDP), produced by a second N-demethylation, are detectable in the urine of those taking methadone.

### Route of administration

The most common route of administration at a methadone clinic is in a racemic oral solution, though in Germany, only the R enantiomer (the L optical isomer) has traditionally been used, as it is responsible for most of the desired opioid effects. The single-isomer form is becoming less common due to the higher production costs.
Methadone is available in traditional pills, sublingual tablets, and two different formulations designed for the person to drink. Drinkable forms include ready-to-dispense liquid (sold in the United States as Methadose), and Diskets (known on the street as "wafers" or "biscuits") tablets which are dispersible in water for oral administration, used similarly to Alka-Seltzer. The liquid form is the most common as it allows for smaller dose changes. Methadone is almost as effective when administered orally as by injection. Oral medication is usually preferable because it offers safety, and simplicity and represents a step away from injection-based drug abuse in those recovering from addiction. U.S. federal regulations require the oral form in addiction treatment programs. Injecting methadone pills can cause collapsed veins, bruising, swelling, and possibly other harmful effects. Methadone pills often contain talc that, when injected, produces a swarm of tiny solid particles in the blood, causing numerous minor blood clots. These particles cannot be filtered out before injection, and will accumulate in the body over time, especially in the lungs and eyes, producing various complications such as pulmonary hypertension, an irreversible and progressive disease. The formulation sold under the brand name Methadose (flavored liquid suspension for oral dosing, commonly used for maintenance purposes) should not be injected either.
Information leaflets included in packs of UK methadone tablets state that the tablets are for oral use only and that use by any other route can cause serious harm. In addition to this warning, additives have now been included in the tablet formulation to make the use of them by the IV route more difficult.
Methadone is also available in ampoules with strength of 50mg/ml & 10mg/ml for IV/IM/SC use in the UK. Prescribing the injectable formulation was more common in the 90s with prescribers reporting that up to 9-10% of all methadone prescription were for ampoules. This practice is much less common nowadays

## Chemistry

### Detection in biological fluids

Methadone and its major metabolite, 2-ethylidene-1,5-dimethyl-3,3-diphenylpyrrolidine (EDDP), are often measured in urine as part of a drug abuse testing program, in plasma or serum to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized victims, or in whole blood to assist in a forensic investigation of a traffic or other criminal violation or a case of sudden death. Methadone usage history is considered in interpreting the results as a chronic user can develop tolerance to doses that would incapacitate an opioid-naïve individual. Chronic users often have high methadone and EDDP baseline values.

### Conformation

The protonated form of methadone takes on an extended conformation, while the free base is more compact. In particular, it was found that there is an interaction between the tertiary amine and the carbonyl carbon of the ketone function (R3N ••• >C=O) that limits the molecule's conformation freedom, though the distance (291 pm by X-ray) is far too long to represent a true chemical bond. However, it does represent the initial trajectory of attack of an amine on a carbonyl group and was an important piece of experimental evidence for the proposal of the Bürgi–Dunitz angle for carbonyl addition reactions.

## History

Methadone was developed in 1937 in Germany by scientists working for I.G. Farbenindustrie AG at the Farbwerke Hoechst who were looking for a synthetic opioid that could be created with readily available precursors, to solve Germany's opium and morphine shortage problem. On 11 September 1941 Bockmühl and Ehrhart filed an application for a patent for a synthetic substance they called Hoechst 10820 or Polamidon (a name still in regular use in Germany) and whose structure had little relation to morphine or other "true opiates" such as diamorphine (Heroin), desomorphine (Permonid), nicomorphine (Vilan), codeine, dihydrocodeine, oxymorphone (Opana), hydromorphone (Dilaudid), oxycodone (OxyContin), hydrocodone (Dicodid), and other closely related opium alkaloid derivatives and analogues. It was brought to market in 1943 and was widely used by the German army during WWII as a substitute for morphine.
In the 1930s, pethidine (meperidine) went into production in Germany; however, the production of methadone, then being developed under the designation Hoechst 10820, was not carried forward because of side effects discovered in the early research. After the war, all German patents, trade names, and research records were requisitioned and expropriated by the Allies. The records on the research work of the I.G. Farbenkonzern at the Farbwerke Hoechst were confiscated by the U.S. Department of Commerce Intelligence, investigated by a Technical Industrial Committee of the U.S. Department of State and then brought to the US. The report published by the committee noted that while methadone itself was potentially addictive, it produced "considerably" less euphoria, sedation, and respiratory depression than morphine at equianalgesic doses and was thus interesting as a commercial drug. The same report also compared methadone to pethidine. German researchers reported that methadone was capable of producing strong morphine-like physical dependence, which is characterized by opioid withdrawal symptoms which are lesser in severity and intensity compared to morphine, but methadone was associated with a considerably prolonged or protracted withdrawal syndrome when compared to morphine. Morphine produced higher rates of self-administration and reinforcing behaviour in both human and animal subjects when compared to both methadone and pethidine. In comparison to equianalgesic doses of pethidine (Demerol), methadone was shown to produce less euphoria, but higher rates of constipation, and roughly equal levels of respiratory depression and sedation.
In the early 1950s, methadone (most times the racemic HCl salts mixture) was also investigated for use as an antitussive.
Isomethadone, noracymethadol, LAAM, and normethadone were first developed in Germany, the United Kingdom, Belgium, Austria, Canada, and the United States in the thirty or so years after the 1937 discovery of pethidine, the first synthetic opioid used in medicine. These synthetic opioids have increased length and depth of satiating any opiate cravings and generate very strong analgesic effects due to their long metabolic half-life and strong receptor affinity at the mu-opioid receptor sites. Therefore, they impart much of the satiating and anti-addictive effects of methadone by suppressing drug cravings.
It was only in 1947 that the drug was given the generic name "methadone" by the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry of the American Medical Association. Since the patent rights of the I.G. Farbenkonzern and Farbwerke Hoechst were no longer protected, each pharmaceutical company interested in the formula could buy the rights for the commercial production of methadone for just one dollar (MOLL 1990).
Methadone was introduced into the United States in 1947 by Eli Lilly and Company as an analgesic under the trade name Dolophine. An urban myth later arose that Nazi leader Adolf Hitler ordered the manufacture of methadone or that the brand name 'Dolophine' was named after him, probably based on the similarity of "doloph" with "Adolph". (The pejorative term "adolphine" would appear in the early 1970s.) However, the name "Dolophine" was a contraction of "Dolo" from the Latin word dolor (pain), and finis, the Latin word for "end". Therefore, Dolophine literally means "pain end".
Methadone was studied as a treatment for opioid addiction at the Addiction Research Center of the Narcotics Farm in Lexington, Kentucky in the 1950s, and by Rockefeller University physicians Robert Dole and Marie Nyswander in the 1960s in New York City. By 1976, methadone clinics had opened in cities including Chicago, New York, and New Haven, with some 38,000 patients treated in New York City alone.

## Society and culture

### Brand names

Brand names include Dolophine, Symoron, Amidone, Methadose, Physeptone, Metadon, Metadol, Metadol-D, Heptanon and Heptadon among others.

### Economics

In the US, generic methadone tablets are inexpensive, with retail prices ranging from \$0.25 to \$2.50 per defined daily dose.
Methadone maintenance clinics in the US may be covered by private insurance, Medicaid, or Medicare. Medicare covers methadone under the prescription drug benefit, Medicare Part D, when it is prescribed for pain, but not when it is used for opioid dependence treatment because it cannot be dispensed in a retail pharmacy for this purpose. In California methadone maintenance treatment is covered under the medical benefit. Patients' eligibility for methadone maintenance treatment is most often contingent on them being enrolled in substance abuse counseling. People on methadone maintenance in the US either have to pay cash or if covered by insurance must complete a pre-determined number of hours per month in therapeutic groups or counseling. The United States Department of Veteran's Affairs (VA) Alcohol and Drug Dependence Rehabilitation Program offers methadone services to eligible veterans enrolled in the VA health care system.
Methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) cost analyses often compare the cost of clinic visits versus the overall societal costs of illicit opioid use. A preliminary cost analysis conducted in 2016 by the US Department of Defense determined that methadone treatment, which includes psychosocial and support services, may cost an average of \$126.00 per week or \$6,552.00 per year. The average cost for one full year of methadone maintenance treatment is approximately \$4,700 per patient, whereas one full year of imprisonment costs approximately \$24,000 per person.

## Regulation

### United States and Canada

Methadone is a Schedule I controlled substance in Canada and Schedule II in the United States, with an ACSCN of 9250 and a 2014 annual aggregate manufacturing quota of 31,875 kilos for sale. Methadone intermediate is also controlled, under ACSCN 9226 also under Schedule II, with a quota of 38,875 kilos. In most countries of the world, methadone is similarly restricted. The salts of methadone in use are the hydrobromide (free base conversion ratio 0.793), hydrochloride (0.894), and HCl monohydrate (0.850). Methadone is also regulated internationally as a Schedule I controlled substance under the United Nations Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs of 1961.

#### Methadone clinics

In the United States, prescription of methadone requires intensive monitoring and must be obtained in-person from an Opioid Treatment Program—colloquially known as a 'methadone clinic'—when prescribed for opioid use disorder (OUD). According to federal laws, methadone cannot be prescribed by a doctor and obtained from a pharmacy to treat addiction. Because of its long half-life, methadone is almost invariably prescribed to be taken in a single daily dose. At nearly all methadone clinics in the US, patients must visit a clinic to receive and take their dose under the supervision of a nurse. Both patients who are new to methadone treatment and high-risk patients—such as those who are using drugs and alcohol, including cannabis in some states—must visit the clinic daily.

### Other countries

In Russia, methadone treatment is illegal. In 2008, the Chief Sanitary Inspector of Russia Gennadiy Onishchenko, stated that Russian health officials were not convinced of methadone's efficacy in treating heroin and/or opioid addiction. Instead of replacement therapy and gradual reduction of illicit drug use, Russian doctors encouraged immediate cessation and withdrawal. People who use drugs were generally given sedatives and non-opioid analgesics to cope with withdrawal symptoms.
As of 2015, China had the largest methadone maintenance treatment program with over 250,000 people in over 650 clinics in 27 provinces.

## Veterinary use

Methadone is a common perioperative analgesic in cats and dogs with a variety of routes of administration. Methadone in combination with acepromazine provides greater sedation than the equivalent combination involving morphine or butorphanol. Methadone's depressive effect on the cardiovascular system is approximately twice as strong as morphine. Methadone is contradicated for gastroduodenoscopy. Methadone provides greater analgesia than buprenorphine for orthopaedic and ovariohysterectomy procedures in dogs. Fluconazole and methadone given concurrently as a subcutaneous administration twice over a 6 hour period can provide analgesia for 12–24 hours. Methadone can be used for sedation in horses but is less effective than butorphanol, it can be combined with detomidine, which improves efficacy but can cause ataxia although the combination with detomidine has significantly less cardiovascular depressive effects than a combination with acepromazine. Methadone may be more effective as an analgesic in horses when adiminstered parenterally or epidurally as opposed to intravenously. Opioids are uncommon for livestock due to legislation surrounding usage but intravenous methadone is an effective analgesic in sheep and epidural methadone is an effective analgesic in cattle and sheep.
