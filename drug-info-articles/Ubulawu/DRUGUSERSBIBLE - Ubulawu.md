## Subjective Experience

Enticed by stories of its ancient ritual use in Africa, I chose ubulawu for one of my
first forays into the botanical arena.

I paid much attention to detail during the preparation, following authentic
techniques as closely as I could. The procedure included crushing the root, shaking it
in half a jar of water until froth appeared on the top, and spooning this into my
mouth. This task was performed first thing in the morning, on an empty stomach.

Whilst it is often impossible to determine the difference between placebo and
minimal, there were no wild or vivid dreams, or in fact, anything else. I experienced
practically nothing.

In retrospect I can’t necessarily draw too many general conclusions from this. I have
stated elsewhere that the source of botanicals is usually vital. Here, the dried root
perhaps gave the game away: it looked old; so old that it may have lost whatever
psychoactivity it originally carried.

Internet reports suggest that this is worthy of further experimentation, which I will
endeavour to undertake in the future, should the opportunity arise.
