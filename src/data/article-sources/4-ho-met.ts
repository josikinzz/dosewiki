## Subjective Experience

This is described by Wikipedia as a structural and functional analogue of psilocin,
which in turn is present in most psychedelic mushrooms. Hardly surprisingly, it is
generally considered to produce very similar effects. It was first synthesised by
Alexander Shulgin, and is documented in his book, TiHKAL.

At the time of testing, along with 4-ACO-DMT, 4-HO-MET is increasingly popular,
appearing on the must-do list of many regular Internet posters. It is often suggested
that of the two it offers more head clarity, is less deep, has more visuals, and is
therefore more recreational.

Unfortunately, it will be difficult to draw comparisons in this report, having only
sampled a low dose of 4-AcO-DMT, but I cannot deny that I have been looking
forward to this particular experiment.

My original inclination was to dose at 10-15mg, but social circumstances have again
conspired against me, dictating that I retain a reasonable degree of functionality. I
therefore dose significantly lower.

\`\`\`
T+0:00 6mg is carefully measured from the 11mg that fell out of the small
plastic bag as I poured it on to the pan. I retain the other half for potential use
later in the trip. [2:40pm]
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+0:30 A headspace is slowly emerging, and I feel clammy, although I am
unsure whether I am hot or cold.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+0:50 A very mild and pleasant headiness has developed, which is verging
on serene in nature, suggesting a mood lift. Vision is almost glossy in
character, with a mild sheen. Music is not particularly enhanced.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+1:00 An hour has passed, and given that I consumed on an empty stomach,
I suspect that this is as far as it will go. This is fine, but so am I, so I decide to
toss and wash the other 5mg.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+1:40 The gloss I referred to earlier is slightly stronger, I am warm, and the
headspace is now very comfortable. It isn't overpowering in any way, and I am
easily functional, but there is a rather pleasant ambience to existence.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
I am not experiencing any real visuals at this stage, other than the haze
referred to above. This is contrary to expectations, and to most general user
reports. Perhaps this feature is dose dependent, although it is possible that my
sample isn’t particularly strong.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
No significant pupil dilation is apparent, but there is some tactile sensitivity
present. Although I feel that I am definitely playing in low-dose territory, the
influence of the drug is well into the Shulgin ++ range.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+2:00 I am in a reflective state of general psychedelic awareness. The
headspace has a gentle character to it, with no perceptible rough edges. Focus
on individual tasks is fairly straight forward if required, but the desire to bathe
in the overall warmth is stronger.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+2:40 I am now floating on a plateau, having peaked some time ago. I sense
that from here I will experience a slow and gentle come-down, which I expect
to last a couple of hours. I remain comfortable however, in a somewhat
numbed bubble of contentedness. The body sensation of light tactility is still
physically present, but the clamminess is subsiding.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+3:10 I continue to feel serene but I am now unengaged enough to pro-
actively seek some form of extra entertainment, courtesy of YouTube. I
purposely avoid the news, as it is generally bad, and I have an eye on set and
setting.
\`\`\`

\`\`\`
At this stage I feel more equipped to draw comparison with the low dose of 4-
ACO-DMT which I sampled a couple of weeks ago. This certainly has a milder
less intense feel about it, with possibly less scope for introspection. I would
have to go deeper with both to offer anything more substantive.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+4:00 I have just consumed a meal without difficulty. Given that by now I
am well into the dying embers of the experience, perhaps it is not surprising
that I noticed no particular degradation or enhancement of taste or appetite.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
To all intents and purposes the show now appears to be over. I feel largely at
base, with a mild psychedelic fatigue and lassitude, as is usual for most
members of this class.
\`\`\`
In retrospect, I feel that I would have learned far more had I gone with the whole
11mg which fate served from the packet, rather than taking it in two halves. However,
this was still a positive low-end experience, with no real negatives or unwanted side
effects.

As with 4-ACO-DMT, I hope to return to this in due course.

[17 mg oral] "I was feeling extremely sick [...] had to control my breathing as to not throw up [...] suddenly extremely cold even though my palms were clammy and the rest of my body was hot [...] heart was beating extremely fast [...] I much feel better [...] had a stomach ache [...] I was sweating to death and clammy [...] The walls were twisting and turning)..." -- [Exp 91175](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=91175)
 
[18 mg oral] "I felt a little giggly [...] anxiety began to set in [...] Nausea began to set in [...] my heart-rate and breathing felt strange [...] I began to have very negative and sad thoughts [...] begin to see the typical rainbow-fractals that looked really similar to what I've seen on shrooms multiple times [...] feels very similar to shrooms but a little different [...] I have very deep, and introspective thoughts regarding our existence..." -- [Exp 91567](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=91567)
 
[27 mg sublingual] "Some time dilation [...] Intensification and bleeding of colors. A strange effect of straight edges seeming to flow to the right, into themselves [...] quite like 4-AcO-DMT [...] Very good closed-eye visuals [...] Bright colors, very complex designs [...] All the colors of the rainbow in spiralling, fractal patterns which changed at all times [...] It reminds me of the spiral fractal in MilkDrop (the visualization program for Winamp) [...] The overall vibe was very friendly [...]" -- [Exp 63399](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=63399)

*TiHKAL Entry #21*


## SYNTHESIS
To 10 mL of a stirred solution of LAH (1 M in THF under N2), there was added dropwise a solution of 0.57 4-acetoxyindol-3-yl-N-ethyl-N-methylglyoxylamide in 10 mL anhydrous THF. When the addition was complete, the reaction mixture was brought to a reflux for 15 min. After cooling to 40 Â°C, sufficient water was added to decompose both the reaction complex and the excess hydride. After filtration through Celite (under an N2 atmosphere), the solvent was removed under vacuum, and the solid residue recrystallized from EtOAc/hexane to provide 0.18 g (41%) N-ethyl-4-hydroxy-N-methylindole (4-HO-MET) with a mp 118â119 Â°C. Anal: C,H,N.


## DOSAGE

## DURATION

## QUALITATIVE COMMENTS

## EXTENSIONS AND COMMENTARY
Whatâs to choose between them? From the view-point of synthesis, the cost and availability of the secondary amine will certainly be a factor. Both methylethyl amine and methylisopropylamine are available, but are quite expensive. Dimethylamine, on the other hand, is dirt cheap but it is a recognized precursor to DMT and thus is difficult to find. In any events, the dimethyl compound is widely available in the mycological arena, and I suspect it would be simplest to stay with nature.

**4-Hydroxy-N-methyl-N-ethyltryptamine** (also known as **colour** , **methylcybin** , **metocin** , and **4-HO-MET** ) is a lesser-known novel [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) substance of the [tryptamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tryptamine) class. 4-HO-MET is structurally related to [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) , the active ingredient in [psilocybin mushrooms](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocybin_mushrooms) ( **"magic mushrooms"** ). It is thought to produce its effects by binding to [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) [receptors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Receptors) in the brain.

4-HO-MET was first synthesized by the American chemist [Alexander Shulgin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alexander_Shulgin) , who documented it in his 1997 book [TiHKAL](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/TiHKAL) ("Tryptamines I Have Known and Loved"). Reports of human use began to surface in the late 2000s, following its appearance on the online [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) market. It has been sold alongside other psilocybin analogues such as [4-AcO-DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-AcO-DMT) and [4-HO-MiPT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-HO-MiPT) .

[Subjective effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effects) include [geometric visual hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Geometry) , [time distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Time_distortion) , [enhanced introspection](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Introspection) , and [ego loss](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ego_loss) . Users typically describe 4-HO-MET as a more recreational version of [psilocybin mushrooms](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocybin_mushrooms) or [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) (4-HO-DMT) due to its less serious headspace and greater emphasis on visual effects. Its psychedelic visuals are reported to be vivid and colorful.

Very little data exists about the pharmacological properties, metabolism, and toxicity of 4-HO-MET. It is assumed to have a similar risk and toxicity profile as psilocin and [4-AcO-DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-AcO-DMT) but there is no data to support this. It is highly advised to use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Harm_reduction_practices) if using this substance.

## Chemistry

4-HO-MET, or 4-hydroxy-N-ethyl-N-methyltryptamine, is a synthetic indole alkaloid molecule of the [tryptamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tryptamine) chemical class. Tryptamines share a core structure comprised of a bicyclic indole heterocycle attached at R 3 to an amino group via an ethyl side chain. 4-HO-MET is substituted at R 4 of its indole heterocycle with a hydroxyl functional group OH−. It also contains a methyl group and an ethyl chain bound to the terminal amine R N of its tryptamine backbone ( [MET](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MET) ).

4-HO-MET is a 4-hydroxy homolog of [4-AcO-MET](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-AcO-MET) and the N-substituted ethyl homolog of psilocin ( [4-HO-DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-HO-DMT) ). It is also the 4-hydroxyl analog of the base tryptamine [MET](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MET) .

## Pharmacology

4-HO-MET's [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) effects are believed to come from its activity at the [5-HT2A receptor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin#The_5-HT_system) as a [partial agonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist#Agonists) . However, the role of these interactions and how they result in the [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) experience remains subject to on-going scientific investigation.

## Subjective effects

A large body of anecdotal reports suggests that the active dose can vary greatly. Some users report very heavy experiences with doses as low as 17mg, while others report light experiences with doses as high as 30 mg. Possible causes may be attributed to individual differences in neurochemistry and metabolism as well as variations in batch quality and physical forms (e.g. HCl vs. fumarate salt).

The experiences reported indicate hallucinatory states coming in waves of euphoria, swapping from moments of sobriety to intense visuals. Because 4-HO-MET is heavy on visuals and light on cognitive distress, it can be described as a recreational and practical alternative to psilocybin mushrooms, with thematic similarities in visual effects.

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)** - 4-HO-MET is primarily stimulating, although it can also be relaxing and stoning. This sets it apart from tryptamines like [psilocybin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocybin) and [4-AcO-DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-AcO-DMT) , which are primarily sedating.
- **[Spontaneous bodily sensations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_bodily_sensations)** - The "body high" of 4-HO-MET can be described as a pleasurable, warm, soft, and all-encompassing tingling sensation. This maintains a consistent presence that steadily rises following the onset and hits its limit once the peak has been reached.
- **[Changes in felt bodily form](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Changes_in_felt_bodily_form)** - This effect is often accompanied by a sense of warmth or [unity](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Unity_and_interconnectedness#Unity_between_the_self_and_specific_external_systems) and usually occurs around or directly after the peak of the experience. Users can feel as if they are physically part of or conjoined with other objects in a seamless continuity. This is usually reported as feeling comfortable, tranquil and mindful, although it can also manifest in the form of bodily tension
- **[Nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea)** - This effect can be greatly lessened or even completely avoided if the individual has an empty stomach prior to ingestion. It is sometimes recommended that one either refrain from eating for approximately 6 to 8 hours before-hand, or to eat a light meal 2 hours before if the user is feeling physically fatigued and undernourished. The nausea produced by 4-HO-MET is generally considered to be much less prominent than it is with [psilocybin mushrooms](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocybin#Psilocybin-containing_mushrooms) , which has been attributed to the lack of fungal-matter the body has to digest when the isolated synthetic form is consumed.
- **[Temperature regulation suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Temperature_regulation_suppression)** - 4-HO-MET can cause fluctuations in the user's internal sense of temperature, which can manifest as sudden bouts of uncomfortable coldness or warmth.
- **[Muscle contractions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_contractions)** - The muscle contractions that can occasionally be produced by 4-HO-MET tend to be transient and benign feeling in nature, compared to many other [tryptamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tryptamines) , [phenethylamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamines) and [lysergamides](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Lysergamides) .
- **[Increased heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Olfactory hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Olfactory_hallucination)**
- **[Pupil dilation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pupil_dilation)**
- **[Increased salivation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_salivation)**
- **[Excessive yawning](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Excessive_yawning)** - This effect seems to be uniquely pronounced among psilocin and related tryptamines. It can occur to a lesser degree on [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) and very rarely on psychedelic [phenethylamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamines) like [mescaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mescaline) . It typically occurs in conjunction with [watery eyes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Watery_eyes) .
- **[Watery eyes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Watery_eyes)**
- **[Teeth grinding](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Teeth_grinding)** - This component is considerably less intense when compared with that of substances like [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) when it does happen to occur, but happens more readily than with related substances like [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) or [psilocybin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocybin) , perhaps owing to the greater degree of stimulation it produces.
- **[Brain zaps](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Brain_zaps)** - Brain zaps are uncommon and thought to only occur in those who are susceptible to them. They are much less prevalent and intense than those that occur with serotonin releasing agents such as [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) .
- **[Seizure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizure)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] - Psychedelics are known to lower the seizure threshold and may increase the likelihood of a seizure occurring in those who have a personal susceptibility or a family history of epilepsy. It is not considered a risk in healthy people. ### Visual effects
 
- 4-HO-MET is commonly reported to produce visual effects with minimal accompanying cognitive effects or "head space" at lower doses. 
#### Enhancements
 
- **[Colour enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_enhancement)**
- **[Pattern recognition enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition_enhancement)**
- **[Visual acuity enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_acuity_enhancement)**
 
#### Distortions
 
- **[Drifting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_drifting)** *( [melting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_drifting#Melting) , [flowing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_drifting#Flowing) , [breathing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_drifting#Breathing) and [morphing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_drifting#morphing) )* - In comparison to other psychedelics, this effect can be described as highly detailed, cartoon-like in style, slow and smooth in motion and static in appearance.
- **[After images](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/After_images)**
- **[Colour shifting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_shifting)**
- **[Recursion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Recursion)**

- **[Symmetrical texture repetition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Symmetrical_texture_repetition)**
- **[Environmental patterning](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Environmental_patterning)**
- **[Tracers](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tracers)**
 
#### Geometry
 
The visual geometry produced by 4-HO-MET can be described as somewhat similar in appearance to that of [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) (4-HO-DMT) and [4-HO-MiPT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-HO-MiPT) but with far stronger synthetic digital undertones reminiscent of [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) or [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) . 4-HO-MET can be comprehensively described through its [variations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Geometry#Variations) as intricate in complexity, abstract in form, equally synthetic and organic in style, structured in organization, extremely brightly lit and multicoloured in scheme, glossy in shading, sharp in edges, large in size, fast in speed, smooth in motion, angular in corners, non-immersive in-depth and consistent in intensity. The visuals have a contradictory natural and synthetic feel to them which is reminiscent of both [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) and [psilocybin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocybin) .
 
#### Hallucinatory states
 
4-HO-MET and its various other forms produce a full range of high level hallucinatory states in a fashion that is more consistent and reproducible than that of many other commonly used [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) . These effects generally include:
 
- **[Transformations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Transformations)**
- **[Internal hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucination)** ( *[autonomous entities](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Autonomous_entities)* ; *[settings, sceneries, and landscapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Settings,_sceneries,_and_landscapes)* ; *[perspective hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perspective_hallucinations)* and *[scenarios and plots](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenarios_and_plots)* ) - This effect is very consistent in dark environments at appropriately high doses. They can be comprehensively described through their [variations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucinations#Variations) as lucid in believability, interactive in style, new experiences in content, autonomous in controllability, [geometry](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Geometry) -based in style and almost exclusively of a personal, religious, spiritual, science-fiction, fantasy, surreal, nonsensical or transcendental nature in their overall theme.
- **[External hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/External_hallucination)** ( *[autonomous entities](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Autonomous_entities)* ; *[settings, sceneries, and landscapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Settings,_sceneries,_and_landscapes)* ; *[perspective hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perspective_hallucinations)* and *[scenarios and plots](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenarios_and_plots)* ) - They can be comprehensively described through their [variations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/External_hallucinations#Variations) as lucid in believability, interactive in style, new experiences in content, autonomous in controllability, [geometry](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Geometry) -based in style and almost exclusively of a personal, religious, spiritual, science-fiction, fantasy, surreal, nonsensical or transcendental nature in their overall theme. ### Cognitive effects
 
- The cognitive effects of 4-HO-MET are described by many as somewhat relaxing yet fast-paced in style with similarities to [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) such as [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) or [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) which tend to be cognitively energetic and stimulating. 
- **[Analysis enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Analysis_enhancement)**
- **[Conceptual thinking](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Conceptual_thinking)**
- **[Delusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusion)**
- **[Autonomous voice communication](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Autonomous_voice_communication)**
- **[Memory suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Memory_suppression)** 
- **[Ego death](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ego_death)**
- **[Analysis enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Analysis_enhancement)** - This effect is consistent in its manifestation and [outrospection](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Outrospection) dominant.
- **[Novelty enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Novelty_enhancement)**
- **[Immersion enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Immersion_enhancement)**
- **[Creativity enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Creativity_enhancement)**
- **[Increased music appreciation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_music_appreciation)**
- **[Increased sense of humor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_sense_of_humor)** 
- **[Laughter fits](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Laughter_fits)**
- **[Personal bias suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Personal_bias_suppression)**
- **[Thought acceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_acceleration)**
- **[Thought connectivity](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_connectivity)**
- **[Thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops)**
- **[Time distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Time_distortion)**
- **[Wakefulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness)** ### Auditory effects
 
- - **[Auditory enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_enhancement)**
- **[Auditory distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_distortion)**
- **[Auditory hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_hallucination)** ### Multi-sensory effects
 
- - **[Synaesthesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Synaesthesia)** - In its fullest manifestation, this is a very rare and non-reproducible effect. Increasing the dosage can increase the likelihood of this occurring, but seems to only be a prominent part of the experience among those who are already predisposed to synaesthetic states. ### Transpersonal effects
 
- Users report that transpersonal effects tend to occur less reliably and impactfully with 4-HO-MET than the closely related [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) or [psilocybin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocybin) , and generally require heavier doses to induce. They are listed below as follows: 
- **[Spirituality enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spirituality_enhancement)**
- **[Existential self-realization](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Existential_self-realization)**
- **[Feelings of interdependent opposites](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Feelings_of_interdependent_opposites)**
- **[Unity and interconnectedness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Unity_and_interconnectedness)**
### Combination effects

- **[Cannabis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cannabis)** - When used in conjunction with cannabis, both the visual and cognitive effects of 4-HO-MET can be intensified and extended with extreme efficacy. This should be used with extreme caution, however, especially if one is not experienced with psychedelics as this can also amplify the [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [confusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Confusion) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) producing aspects of cannabis significantly.
- **[Dissociatives](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociatives)** - When used in combination with dissociatives, the geometry, euphoria, dissociation and hallucinatory effects are often greatly enhanced. Dissociative-induced [holes, spaces, and voids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_disconnection#Holes.2C_spaces_and_voids) while under the influence of 4-HO-MET can result in significantly more vivid visuals than dissociatives alone present, along with more intense [internal hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucinations) , [confusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Confusion) , [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) and chances of a [psychotic reaction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) .
- **[MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA)** - When used in conjunction with MDMA, the physical and cognitive effects of MDMA are amplified. The visual, physical and cognitive effects of 4-HO-MET are also intensified with an overwhelming euphoric pleasure manifested through uniquely pleasurable body highs and headspaces, and uniquely colorful and awe-inspiring visuals. The synergy between these substances is unpredictable, and it is best to start with markedly lower dosages than one would take for both substances individually.
- **[Alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol)** - This interaction is not typically recommended due to alcohol’s ability to cause [dehydration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dehydration) , which can negatively affect a trip if taken in high dosages. This combination is, however, reasonably safe in low doses and when used responsibly, this can often "take the edge off the trip" as well as dull its psychedelic effects in a fashion somewhat similar to benzodiazepines, albeit more in a more stressful way on the body.
- **[Benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines)** - When used in combination with benzodiazepines, benzodiazepines can, depending on the dosage, slightly to completely reduce the intensity of the cognitive, physical and visual effects of a 4-HO-MET trip. With higher doses, they are very efficient at stopping ["bad trips"](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bad_trip) at the cost of reduced trip intensity and in the worst case, amnesia and blacking out. Caution is advised when acquiring them for this purpose, however, due to the very high addiction potential that benzodiazepines possess. It is generally advised to refrain from intending to use them at all unless the trip suddenly becomes completely overwhelming.

## Toxicity and harm potential

The toxicity and long-term health effects of recreational 4-HO-MET use do not seem to have been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dose is unknown. This is because 4-HO-MET is a [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) with very little history of human usage. However, there are reports of very high doses leading to drug induced psychosis.

Anecdotal evidence from those who have tried 4-HO-MET suggests that there are no negative health effects attributed to simply trying the substance by itself at low to moderate doses and using it very sparingly (but nothing can be completely guaranteed). [Independent research](https://www.google.com/) should always be done to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe before consumption.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this substance.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

4-HO-MET is not habit-forming, and the desire to use it can actually decrease with use. It is most often self-regulating.

Tolerance to the effects of 4-HO-MET is built almost immediately after ingestion. After that, it takes about 3 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 7 days to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). 4-HO-MET presents cross-tolerance with all [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) , meaning that after the consumption of 4-HO-MET all psychedelics will have a reduced effect.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **[Lithium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_(medication))** - Lithium is commonly prescribed for the treatment of [bipolar disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder) . There is a large body of anecdotal evidence that suggests taking it with [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) significantly increases the risk of [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) and [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) . As a result, this combination is strictly discouraged.
- **[Cannabis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cannabis)** - Cannabis may have an unexpectedly strong and unpredictable synergy with the effects of 4-HO-MET. Caution is advised with this combination as it can significantly increase the risk of adverse psychological reactions like [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) , and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) . Users are advised to start off with only a fraction of their normal cannabis dose and take long breaks between hits to avoid unintentional overdose.
- **[Stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants)** - Stimulants like [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) , [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) or [methylphenidate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylphenidate) affect many parts of the brain and alter [dopaminergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) function. This combination can increase the risk of [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) , and [thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops) . This interaction may also result in an elevated risk of [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) . [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol)** - Tramadol is well-documented to lower the seizure threshold and [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) may act to trigger seizures in susceptible individuals. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

## Legal status

- **Austria** : 4-HO-MET is illegal to possess, produce and sell under the NPSG (Neue-Psychoaktive-Substanzen-Gesetz Österreich). [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **Canada** : 4-HO-MET is unscheduled in Canada.
- **Germany** : 4-HO-MET is controlled under the NpSG ( *New Psychoactive Substances Act* ) as of July 18, 2019. Production and import with the aim to place it on the market, administration to another person, placing it on the market and trading is punishable. Possession is illegal but not punishable. The legislator considers it possible that orders of 4-HO-MET are punishable as an incitement to place it on the market.
- **Japan** : 4-HO-MET is a controlled substance in Japan effective March 25th, 2015.

*Source: https://thedrugclassroom.com/video/4-ho-met/*

4-HO-MET is a tryptamine psychedelic that has been minimally researched and is primarily sold through the research chemical (RC) and novel psychoactive substance (NPS) market. However, it does have a longer history of use than a lot of RCs, having been subjectively described by the chemist Alexander Shulgin in the 1990s and somewhat widely used since the 2000s.

It is known for producing less mentally intense, though highly visual experiences relative to psychedelics like LSD, psilocin, and 4-AcO-DMT. That is a fair general characterization of the drug, but its tendency to be recreational and clearheaded should not be overstated. Some users experience strong mental effects at common doses and for a large portion of users it will eventually become intense if high enough doses are used. As is true for essentially all psychedelics, it deserves respect and should not be treated as a risk-free substance. A proper set and setting remain important factors for reducing the risks and enhancing the positive aspects of the drug.

## ROAs and Dose

Oral is the most common route of administration, followed by intranasal, and occasionally it is taken rectally or via injection (IV or IM). Because substantially more people have taken it orally than through other routes, more is known about the appropriate oral dose and usually that ROA provides reliable effects. Rectal administration is normally reported to work fine, but since it can be more of a hassle and does not offer a substantial potency difference, along with unreliably reducing nausea, it may not be worthwhile.

Intranasal use may cause temporary pain, though few reports have commented on that aspect of the administration. It also offers minimal potency benefit overall, but its faster onset is enjoyed by some.

There is a significant degree of inconsistency between users as to the drug’s potency, specifically the potency of its mental effects. Some users experience notable mental changes at common doses, yet others can use much higher doses with seemingly little risk of difficult experiences, though even if you are experiencing very manageable effects at higher doses, it is important to remain cautious since that quality of the drug may one day change.

Redoses

It appears to be more easily redosed than a lot of psychedelics. As a general rule, this practice is still discouraged because it adds an extra layer of unpredictability to the experience, but the reports tend to indicate it can bring back or increase the intensity while showing little evidence of acute tolerance and it has the benefit of extending the duration of a relatively short-acting drug. Some users report success taking 0.5 to 1x the original dose 1.5-2.5 hours after the first administration.

At strong+ doses this becomes progressively riskier. For example, it could mean a jump from 30 mg to 45-60 mg, rather than a more reasonable increase from 10 mg to 20 mg, so taking 0.5x or less for the redose is safer when working with higher amounts. Multiple redoses should be more strictly avoided.

#### Oral

Light: 5 – 10 mg

Common: 10 – 20 mg

Strong: 20 – 30+ mg

Most people use 10 to 30 mg. Among those who find the drug particularly easygoing, the reasonable dose range can extend into the 30s or 40s, but those does should not be taken by people who have not already experienced lower doses, and the dose should only be increased by a small amount each experience (e.g. 5 mg per use) instead of making large jumps.

Users who easily handle common to strong doses can still end up having difficult experiences upon pushing the dose higher. 4-HO-MET can be considered a more recreational psychedelic, but it is not boundlessly friendly.

#### Intranasal

Light: 5 – 10 mg

Common: 10 – 20 mg

Strong: 20 – 25 mg

## Timeline

**Oral**

Total: 4 – 6 hours

Onset: 15 to 30 min

Although the duration is around 4 to 6 hours, the peak can be especially short at light to common doses, resulting in a substantial decline in the effects 3-4 hours into the experience, with more residual-level effects beyond that point. The duration is sometimes considered too short, but others find it nice to have a psychedelic whose strongest effects only stick around a couple hours, distinguishing it from drugs like LSD that use up the better part of a day.

The oral onset is faster than average. Occasionally people feel effects in<15 min, the most common onset time is 15 to 30 min, and most users feel it within 45 min. The earliest effects are normally bodily sensations, some anxiety, and a general sense that something is different, rather than visuals.

Anxiety, uncomfortable bodily effects, and a sense of being overwhelmed regularly occur during the comeup, with the experience becoming more comfortable as the effects progress. Sometimes the physical activation and GI effects kick in faster than the mood elevation and pleasurable aspects of the body high, but this uncomfortable period is brief and not everyone encounters it.

**Intranasal**

Total: 3 – 4 hours (The effects often decline within two hours.)

Onset: 5 to 15 min

Because it has a faster onset, intranasal use has a greater chance of being intense at the beginning, leading to more overwhelming and disorienting effects early on.

**IV**

Total: 1 – 2 hours

Onset: Within 5 minutes (Usually it has a near-immediate onset, developing into the core effects in a matter of minutes.)

#### Mental and Cognitive

**Confusion and ‘Deepness’**

Most often it has a fairly clearheaded mental state that almost feels like soberly experiencing perceptual and mood changes, or it causes transient periods of anxiety and confusion that are still more easily addressed by basic calming techniques and rational thinking than if you were experiencing high-dose LSD, psilocin, or 4-AcO-DMT, for example. It is relatively easy to distract oneself and a change of scenery, company, or music may be all it takes to address the more difficult periods of a common dose experience. Thinking can still speed up and thoughts frequently become more random and tangential, occasionally leading to thought loops and negative intrusive thoughts.

This same property of causing less thought alteration may reduce the chance of therapeutic benefit and insight, or it can simply produce less interesting mental changes, especially for someone familiar with mentally stronger psychedelics. The introspective and entactogenic qualities it does have are more likely to be focused on things like your life, habits, and relationships, rather than on classically “deep” spiritual and cosmic ideas, so in that sense it’s more grounded and more easily navigable because the mental state is closer to normal consciousness. A fairly common experience is feeling more connected to people in your life or to the world–for example, some people feel a profound sense of connection while in nature, but the majority of common dose experiences don’t include those effects.

Ego dissolution is a classic part of psychedelic experiences. Some beneficial or confusing experiences cause effects like not understanding who you are, no longer identifying with your feelings, not identifying with your body, and not remembering your name. This can be frightening, but it also carries the potential for insight since reducing the boundary between yourself and the rest of the world can mean not taking your normal patterns of thinking or your normal sense of self as seriously, helping to overcome rigid ways of being and self-centeredness. At typical doses significant ego dissolution is uncommon.

While it is fairly clearheaded, you should still expect it to be more difficult doing a lot of normal tasks, like answering the phone. Being unexpectedly confronted with those tasks has a good chance of provoking some anxiety and hesitation. You should not fool yourself into thinking you can handle everything just because you feel relatively normal. A lot of users do fine in calm settings, yet spiral into negative or difficult experiences if they try to do too much, like being in public and talking with strangers, partly because trying to hide that you’re on a drug can be very unpleasant on psychedelics. At the end of the day, you are still on a significantly altering drug, and anything that is unsafe when altered, like driving, should not be attempted.

Many users report feeling 4-HO-MET would be a good introductory psychedelic, giving people a way to understand what a somewhat trippy mindset is like and what psychedelic visual distortions entail while carrying comparatively little psychological risk. It’s been likened to 2C-C, 2C-B, and AL-LAD in this regard.

Anxiety and Paranoia

Particularly early on in the effects there can be anxiety centered around experiencing a change in your mental state and sensing reduced control over how you feel and what you perceive, which can leave people questioning their choice to have taken a drug and it can be a trigger for people to fight to maintain control, which is often counterproductive. These feelings normally do not make up a large part of the experience.

Concerns about physical and psychological safety may appear, and they are a common trigger of thought loops, but most people do not report a major issue with those thoughts. Because there is still a chance of anxiety and paranoia, it is good to have a trusted sober person with you since they can help alleviate irrational concerns.

A similar number of reports specifically mention no anxiety and even relaxed effects as those that mention some degree of anxiety or panic.

**Mood**

Normally it causes mood improvement and elation, with those effects appearing early in the experience. It can also feel life-affirming such that people are happy to be alive and happy to be having the experience. Psychedelics in general have an elating effect, but it is frequently covered up and distorted by anxiety and confusion, so the lower rate of those downsides with 4-HO-MET helps the mood elevation come across. It’s not entirely consistent with producing joyous experiences, but it appears more consistent than average. The general mood elevation is also often accompanied by a sense of freedom and a desire to explore, sometimes described as child-like curiosity.

Like with anxiety, periods of low mood can occur. As it is very much a psychedelic, those periods of low mood may come up spontaneously or be associated with an emotional response to difficult things in your life, and in that sense the low mood might not be entirely negative, but rather a trigger for personal growth.

**Amusing**

A very common effect is being more easily amused, as well as laughing for no reason. Some users end up laughing hysterically in an uncontrollable manner, though that effect is almost always positive. Similarly, smiling is a common effect, sometimes occurring without any laughter or amusement being present.

These properties exist with other psychedelics, but appear more common with 4-HO-MET.

**Social**

It is impairing enough to make communication more difficult and stressful, but socializing with people you trust can be more enjoyable. The drug can promote talkativeness and its pro-social effects tend to be brought out the most by calm environments and small groups, not large crowds.

Conversations may be more meaningful, producing some entactogen-like experiences.

Even if you are in the mood to socialize, it can be harder to communicate your thoughts. A lot of people report having essentially unimpaired, coherent thinking, but difficulty expressing their thoughts and feelings to others. You may also find yourself getting confused by the act of talking, in part because it can be harder to hold things in your working and short-term memory. Impaired communication is more common with higher doses.

**Entities**

A minority of users see or otherwise sense the presence of entities, with some qualitative similarities to entity experiences on psilocin or DMT. This almost exclusively occurs at strong+ doses and even using high amounts normally does not cause this effect. Normally the experiences are not frightening and the entities are described as seemingly benevolent, sometimes with the intent of helping the user.

In some of the experiences it seems the perception of entities may just be how users are perceiving a sense of detachment from an inner voice or the sense that there is a dialogue between two internal voices, such as a rational voice and an irrational voice.

**Music enhancement**

It is common to enjoy music more and to find songs more engaging than usual. Music also has a greater influence on your mood and thought processes, and some people find the songs they’re listening to partly sync up with the visuals.

**Time Alteration**

Most users do not experience a substantial change in the perception of time, but a notable minority report time dilation. Things can feel like they are taking much longer than they really are. Often this is a neutral effect, but it can contribute to negative experiences because people feel like they are stuck experiencing bad effects and despite rationally knowing they are on a short-acting drug, it does not feel that way.

**Eroticism**

A minority of users report an increase in sexual thoughts and imagery, but actual enhancement of sex has rarely been discussed and whatever effect is has on sex may not be reliably good, as is typically true for psychedelics.

#### Perceptual

**Visual**

Visual distortions are one of the most common effects and they will usually occur beginning at light doses, becoming very intense by strong+ doses. At common doses it causes open eye visuals (OEVs) and some closed eye visuals (CEVs). Rarely does it produce frank hallucinations, i.e. seeing things in the external environment that do not exist, but high doses can distort your perception enough as to nearly create novel items in your environment. High doses may also allow environments and scenarios to be witnessed with eyes closed, e.g. fanciful situations or scenes from your memory. Those internal hallucinatory experiences can feel a bit like a dream state.

It is known for its very colorful OEVs, which are normally fun to look at and which may be enjoyable enough to make up for an otherwise shallow experience. Surfaces breath and otherwise move, everything in your visual field can vibrate, boundaries between objects and the environment are reduced, and everything takes on a more lively appearance. Typically the visuals are bright, color saturation and intensity increase, and the colors can have a neon-like appearance. Geometric patterns are often seen and a number of reports specifically describe the visuals as Aztec or Mayan-like. Some users see scribbling in the shape of what appears to be letters, so it can seem like you are seeing words in an unknown language.

Usually it is worthwhile to look at nature or the sky rather than just viewing the inside of a building, though both experiences can be satisfying.

Facial features are frequently distorted in cartoony or otherwise unrealistic ways. For example, components of a person’s face can change size and hair may look a different color. Inanimate objects can also morph in a way that makes them look like faces, which is a common psychedelic effect. Seeing faces in objects can be unnerving, even frightening, but normally it is not. A lot of things that come off as somewhat creepy on 4-HO-MET are still relatively easily ignored, preventing the creepiness from triggering fear.

Heavy doses can cause visuals that are more immersive and a bit closer in their appearance to what is produced by DMT, but those effects are usually out of reach with normal doses. And the “breakthrough” dissociative quality of DMT is not really an element of 4-HO-MET, the visuals can just saturate your normal visual field.

After images are common, so moving an object or body part can produce a temporary trail of more transparent images across the movement path. The colors, patterns, fractals, etc may also stand out more when viewed in the dark, though your actual night vision is also likely to be impaired, so be cautious if you are trying to navigate in the dark. Viewing the CEVs or OEVs in the dark comes with a somewhat elevated risk of making the visuals more distressing and frightening.

Among the CEVs are colors, basic geometric patterns, and at the more intense end, complex fractals, but at common doses the CEVs are usually simple.

Despite not being mentally intense, it can be visual to the extent of being described as one of the most visual psychedelics. It is a bit unclear whether the intensity of the visuals is actually that unique or if the visuals simply receive more attention because the mental effects are comparatively tame. With other psychedelics the mental effects may be strong enough to make the visual component of the experience an afterthought.

The visual effects are not universal, but it is only a small minority of users who do not get substantial visual effects at common or strong doses. Though, for some people the distortions produced by lower doses are not very noticeable when you are not paying attention or when an object is moving, so focusing on still objects should make the visuals stand out more.

**Auditory**

It commonly distorts sounds, with effects like making things sound closer or farther, making them sound metallic, and changing voices such that they are perceived as slowed down or less human-like and generally weird.

**Tactile**

Tactile hallucinations are not a major aspect of the drug. Usually this effect just presents as making things you touch or wear feel a bit different, such as smoother or rougher. At high doses, a minority of people experience a sensation of bugs or other things moving on them or within their skin, but this is normally an element of psychotic experiences triggered by overdoses, so it is not something most people have to worry about.

#### Physical

The bodyload is relatively minor compared to many other psychedelics and the effects that exist are not always bothersome. GI issues like nausea are common, but the intensity of those effects is normally low. Vomiting is rare throughout the duration and nausea tends to be more present during the comeup.

Some of the other potential effects are muscle aches or tension (especially in the jaw, legs, and neck), sweating and cold sweats, shakiness and jitteriness, cold extremities (potentially from vasoconstriction), alternating between unpleasant sensations of hot and cold, and a sensation of your body being heavier. Heart rate and blood pressure likely increase moderately and users certainly perceive an increase in cardiovascular activity. A minority experience heart palpitations and chest tightness, but those are far more likely the result of stress than being from anything that could affect safety.

It can cause you to feel physically impaired, particularly when moving around. Some users report it is difficult to walk properly, with that aspect being compared to the effect of sedatives. A small portion of users get allergic or sick-like symptoms, sometimes exclusively during the comedown period. Those effects include a stuffy nose, itchiness, swelling, and skin rashes.

There are a handful of reports of users feeling like they need to urinate frequently, despite not actually needing to. This may merely be a sensation or there could be an effect on your ability to fully empty your bladder. For some users this sensation seems to be a manifestation of stress, so it can even go away during the experience if they calm down and reframe what they are dealing with.

While a bodyload may occur, it can also produce a body high, and the sensations experienced on the drug can often be part of a good body high or negative bodyload depending on your mental state. Among the more positive feelings are tingling and a sense of warmth, though in the cozy blanket way, not the overheating way.

#### Other

The drug’s energy level is more stimulating than sedating. It is not as stimulating as some of the psychedelic amphetamines and phenethylamines, but it is usually energetic enough to produce wakefulness, a relative lack of drowsiness, and sometimes enough energy to be active for things like hiking or dancing. Though it gives enough energy to do those activities, it is not typically coupled with a strong need or desire to be active, unlike with stimulants. Some users receive enough physically manifesting energy that they become restless and cannot get comfortable.

It is frequently said to have a wave-like nature where the visuals, euphoria, and other effects are at a high level of intensity for around 30 to 45 minutes, followed by a period of feeling fairly close to sobriety only to be swept back up in another wave soon after.

#### After Effects

**Insomnia**

A few hours of insomnia after the main effects wear off is common and it may be related to residual stimulation or perceptual changes that are distracting when trying to sleep. Some users find that although they may only be experiencing minor perceptual effects long after administration, such as 8 hours in, those effects take on a darker, scarier appearance upon turning off the lights and trying to sleep. You should expect to be awake for at least 8 to 10 hours after taking a common dose. It is preferable not to use it in the evening since the effects may become more confusing and generally problematic when mixed with greater exhaustion and sleep deprivation.

**Brain Fog**

It is common to feel tired or exhausted after using it, both mentally and physically. Beyond that, it can sometimes leave you feeling a bit ‘fried,’ with effects like brain fog, difficulty thinking straight, and being unproductive. Normally those effects are reset by sleep.

**Day After**

So long as you slept fine after using it, the hangover is typically minimal. The visuals are almost always gone by the time you wake up and normal cognition and wakefulness are restored enough to be productive. When there are after effects, they are usually at the level of feeling a bit happier and more ready for the day than usual, and those effects can sometimes last a few days. Though, a minority still feel exhausted or experience brain fog after sleeping and some users report a minor to moderate headache that usually subsides within a day.

#### Drug Comparisons

**Mushrooms/Psilocin**

The visuals with 4-HO-MET are often qualitatively similar to psilocin, but more intense dose-for-dose. It is also less deep with its mental effects, causing insight, introspection, and spiritual experiences to be more common with psilocin. The rate of easy/positive experiences may be higher and the rate of anxiety may be lower with 4-HO-MET, though some people still dislike it because it produces less of a ‘full’ trip.

**4-AcO-DMT**

Like with how it compares to psilocin, 4-HO-MET is usually more recreational, clearheaded, positive, and visual, but also more shallow. It is more stimulating, such that staying awake is easy, whereas 4-AcO-DMT can be drowsy.

**4-HO-MiPT**

The effects of 4-HO-MiPT are commonly described as being between those of 4-HO-MET and 4-AcO-DMT. It is also fairly recreational, though it can produce stronger mental effects than 4-HO-MET, while still offering good visual effects. 4-HO-MET remains preferable if you are looking for the most consistently positive, easygoing effects.

**4-AcO-MET**

Qualitatively they are very similar, perhaps because 4-AcO-MET hypothetically metabolizes to 4-HO-MET. 4-HO-MET is more potent and may have a faster comeup.

**MDMA**

Some comparisons to MDMA have been made because they can both be euphoric and entactogenic. The consistency of positive, euphoric, and entactogenic experiences is greater with MDMA, but when those effects exist with 4-HO-MET they may feel more natural and meaningful. They also have similar comeup effects with their mental and physical activation, moderate potential for anxiousness, and mood enhancement.

**2C-B**

They are similarly easygoing overall, but 4-HO-MET may still have a slight advantage if you are looking for recreational effects and it may have an easier bodyload.

**LSD**

Both are somewhat stimulating psychedelics, but the headspace of common to strong doses of LSD is stronger on average.

#### Combinations

**Cannabis**

Cannabis can strongly potentiate its effects on perception and the mind, significantly increasing the unpredictability of the effects. Even if you are a regular cannabis user, the combination should be avoided or, at the least, only a small amount of cannabis should be taken.

**Other psychedelics**

A similar warning applies to combining it with other psychedelics as applies to combining it with cannabis. Although a number of success stories exist for combining it with drugs like AL-LAD, 4-AcO-DMT, or LSD, it significantly increases the unpredictability of the experience. It is best to avoid it and if that is not an option, low doses of each drug should be taken.

**MDMA**

Psychedelics very often provide positive experiences when combined with entactogens like MDMA and a handful of reports indicate that holds true for 4-HO-MET. There are safety concerns pertaining to a greater risk of neurotoxicity and an increased risk of seizure and cardiovascular issues, but overall the combination is acutely not very concerning so long as low to common doses are taken.

Together, 4-HO-MET can add visual and other perceptual effects normally lacking from MDMA, while MDMA can offer greater mood improvement and relaxing effects that can serve as a preferable alternative to taking sedatives to smooth out a psychedelic. The entactogenic effects of MDMA may feel more profound and meaningful when experienced from the combination.

**Benzodiazepines**

At low doses benzodiazepines can reduce anxious and stressful effects, but it does not take much for the visual and other beneficial effects to be dampened, so although they can be helpful as a treatment for overly anxious experiences, they are often not a great combination. And if you are trying to combine them as a way to still use psychedelics despite typically having bad experiences with them, it is better to avoid psychedelics or to find behavioral and cognitive ways to overcome whatever negative effects you get from psychedelics.

#### TiHKAL Entry

Alexander Shulgin described it as offering qualitative effects that are “very much like psilocin” to the extent that it would probably not be distinguishable from psilocin in a blinded study. Its wave-like nature was also noted. The entry listed its dose as 10-20 mg (oral) and its duration as 4 to 6 hours.

#### Papers

A 2017 paper looked at online reports of people self-treating migraines and cluster headaches with psychedelics (Andersson, 2017). It found synthetic tryptamines, including 4-HO-MET, have sometimes been used with success for this purpose, though LSD and psilocybin are far more widely used.

The drug’s recreational effects were analyzed by Kjellgren and Soussan (2011), who also utilized online reports. When the authors searched for information in 2010 they discovered no major scientific article database or Erowid’s library discussed the drug, and there were too few English language reports to adequately review the drug’s effects, so the authors used reports from Flashback.org, a popular website in Sweden. Their analysis of 25 reports produced an effect overview that was not dissimilar to the TDC overview. They also reported the most common ROA was oral and a typical dose was 25 mg.
Show Papers(Andersson, 2017) – Study of the self-treatment of migraines and cluster headaches with psychedelics
 
- Methods 
- Internet search that eventually led to collecting reports from Shroomery.org, Bluelight.org, and Clusterbusters.org.
- The selection was restricted to topics initiated during the year before the study. Also, topics focused on established treatments were excluded and topics discussing potential triggers were included because some of the substances utilized in self-treatment may also act as triggers.
- Results 
- Some synthetic tryptamines were occasionally used instead of psilocybin mushrooms because the effects were found to be more manageable. For example, one post stated “4-HO-MiPT and 4-HO-MET are said to be not as chaotic as shrooms.”
- While less common than the use of LSD or psilocybin, some posters discussed using 4-HO-MET for migraine and cluster headache relief, similar to 4-AcO-DMT, 4-HO-MiPT, and 5-MeO-MiPT.
 
(Kjellgren, 2011) – A review of 4-HO-MET’s subjective effects based on online posts
 
- A search was conducted in December 2010. No major scientific article database had information on the drug nor did Erowid’s library. 
- The first set of posts written in English only amounted to five pages of text, which was deemed inadequate for the review, so the authors switched to analyzing Swedish posts because posts in that language were more common.
- 25 anonymous reports published on Flashback.org, a website in Sweden with 450,000+ members, were used. Those reports gave 82 pages of text.
- Results 
- The dose ranged from 20 to 180 mg, with a common dose being 25 mg. The most common ROA was oral (n=21) and insufflation was second (n=3).
- Initial effects 
- The effects gradually became more intense and the first effect involved a tingling sensation in the body, followed by an impaired ability to move. Some other bodily effects were reported: chills, lassitude, heat, and increased HR. The subjects felt different in an undefined manner and they also reported restlessness, mental activation, and nervousness.
- Change of Perception 
- Visual distortions occurred with changes in sharpness, contrast, and color tones. Auditory changes included high and transient “ringing in the ears,” effects that were comparable to tinnitus. Flavors and sounds were deeper than usual.
- Objects moved in wavelike patterns and vibrated. Some visual patterns occurred, first as CEVs, then as OEVs. Those patterns became more complex, turning into fractal-like forms. There was then a more intense period of perceptual alteration involving the appearance of concrete images and objects, both as CEVs and OEVs, and existing objects were perceived as different items or they melted/mixed together.
- Sounds were distorted or experienced as if they were melting together or coming and going out of nothing. Flavors could elicit strong emotional reactions and generate new, unexpected associations. There was an impaired sense of distance and depth.
- Unfiltered Awareness and Intensified Flow of Information 
- Perception, thoughts, and feelings increased in strength and frequency to provide a stream of info that was beyond conscious control and could not be ignored by participants, causing a sense of being overloaded. This contributed to distraction and impaired concentration and memory.
- Normal tasks were more difficult. Text and numbers were harder to understand. Users had a more difficult time expressing their thoughts, feelings, and desires.
- Some users could direct the unfiltered attention and focus, leading to an extreme experience of mindfulness that was very positive and could overshadow the tougher periods.
- Lateral Cognition 
- Increased ability to see new perspectives and to question existing ideas. Cognition switched from being under the control of logical and linear processes to being more creative.
- Participants reported insights into their patterns and habits. They also had an enhanced ability to explore new perspectives and meanings for a variety of things and they tended to question the nature of reality and their place in the universe.
- Blurred Subject-Object Border 
- Subjective states were more easily swayed by things like music, other people, etc. Users had a greater ability to identify with and tune into other people’s emotional states.
- A feeling of leaving one’s body was sometimes reported. Boundaries sometimes fully dissolved such that people were entirely identified with and engulfed by new internal worlds.
- Often the most intense experiences were ultimately described in religious, spiritual, or transpersonal ways.
- Heaven 
- Some experiences of significant euphoria, elation, and increased energy, leading to enjoyment and pleasure. Laughter and humor were common. Laughter was sometimes impossible to stop.
- Intense feelings of deep affection and appreciation. A sense of all-encompassing love.
- Hell 
- The intensity of the experience could generate discomfort, chaos, and a loss of control. People worried about finding their way back to sobriety and they exerted effort trying to control or restrict the experience. They could not distance themselves from anxiety, fear, and paranoia. Somatic sensations of heat, sweating, cold, tension, and increased HR were reported.
- The participants tried different things to reduce the distress. 
- Attempts to fight it with logical reasoning generated an opposite effect.
- Some users sought support from friends, while others used methods like breathing.
- The most effective approach was accepting the experience and resting in what was taking place.
- Subsiding Effects 
- A sense of relief upon returning to normal reality at the end, though sometimes people were sad and felt empty because it was over.
- Some reports of transient discomfort: headaches, mental and physical fatigue, and insomnia.
- Users were generally satisfied with the experience and some reported life-changing effects.

## Chemistry

4-HO-MET is a simple derivative of the base tryptamine, N-methyl-N-ethyltryptamine, differing by its 4-hydroxy substitution. Tryptamine itself lacks psychedelic effects, but the addition of an N-methyl and an N-ethyl group makes it a psychedelic. From there, the potency of MET is increased by the 4-hydroxy substitution present in 4-HO-MET.

It is structurally analogous to 4-HO-DMT, otherwise known as psilocin, the primary active drug obtained from using psilocybin mushrooms. It differs from psilocin by the extension of one of its N-methyl groups by a single carbon, yielding an ethyl substitution.

It is also structurally similar to 4-AcO-MET, which has an acetoxy group in place of the hydroxy group in 4-HO-MET, yielding an acetyl ester analog of the drug. Much as the acetyl ester of psilocin, 4-AcO-DMT, is believed to metabolize to psilocin in the body, there is reason to believe 4-AcO-MET metabolizes to 4-HO-MET. That metabolic pathway is supported by at least one case where toxicology testing found 4-HO-MET was the primary drug in the user’s body following the suspected use of 4-AcO-MET (McIntyre, 2015).

4-HO-MET is typically sold as the fumarate or HCl salt.

## Pharmacology

The main effects are likely mediated by the 5-HT2A receptor, where it has a high affinity and functions as a partial agonist (Rickli, 2016). It also binds with a nanomolar or low micromolar affinity to 5-HT1A, 5-HT2C, histamine H1, trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR 1 ), dopamine D2 and D3, and α1A and 2A adrenergic receptors.

It has a high affinity for the serotonin transporter, where it also has somewhat appreciable reuptake inhibition effects, although direct serotonin receptor agonism is likely a bigger contributor to its effects. It does not have monoamine releasing properties.

Affinity and efficacy values

The following data is from Rickli (2016) and is given in nanomolar (smaller values mean higher affinity). Aside from the TAAR 1 receptor, human genes were used to express the targets using HEK293 cells to obtain affinity data. For 5-HT2A activity research, human 5-HT2A was expressed in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (NIT-3T3 cells).

#### Pharmacokinetics

Bruni (2018) evaluated its metabolism in vitro using pooled human liver microsomes (pHLM) and in vivo using three human forensic cases where the patient’s urine tested positive for 4-HO-MET. In vivo four metabolites were identified, with transformations include hydroxylation, glucuronidation of the parent compound, and glucuronidation of an N-oxide metabolite.

In vitro, 12 metabolites were identified, with transformations include monohydroxylation, dihydroxylation, N-oxide formation, demethylation, carboxylic acid formation, and desethylation. Three of the monohydroxylated metabolites were modified at the benzene ring of its indole structure.

## History

#### 1990s

Alexander Shulgin synthesized 4-HO-MET and briefly described its subjective activity in TiHKAL, which was published in 1997.

#### 2000s – 2010s

Internet-based vendors began selling the substance around the 2000s, leading to a fair number of online reports describing the drug at this time.

Of 436 tryptamine drug samples sent to the Spanish drug checking service Energy Control between 2006 and 2015, 19 were thought to be 4-HO-MET by the users sending them in (either from within Spain or internationally) and 17/19 were confirmed to be 4-HO-MET, while one was 4-HO-DET, and one contained no active substance (Palma-Conesa, 2017). The drug also showed up in one of two samples thought to be 4-AcO-MET.

Data from the European Union’s EMCDDA shows it began to be seized by law enforcement around the EU starting in the late 2000s. For the most part the seizures were of personal quantities. As of 2014, the drug was uncontrolled in Belgium and Bulgaria, while it was controlled in Finland, Hungary, Lithuania, Portugal, Slovakia, and Sweden (Blanckaert, 2014).

- Reports from law enforcement to the EMCDDA, as reported by Blanckaert (2014) 
- Belgium 
- July 2014 – Analysis of a seized tablet named “Psylocibium” that contained 4-HO-MET.
- Norway 
- December 2011 – Seizure of 0.36 g of light grey powder
- Bulgaria 
- July 2011 – Two seizures of 0.671 g cream powder in 37 packages of a product called “Matrix”
- Finland 
- First half of 2009 – Three seizures of powder, amounting to 0.85 g.
- February 2009 – One seizure of 0.1 g white powder by Finnish Customs.
- 2008 – Two seizures, totaling 0.1 g powder.
- Sweden 
- First half of 2009 – Six seizures of powder (0.66 g)
- 2008 – One seizure of 4.85 g powder and seven other seizures of powder amounting to 2.37 g.
- August 2007 – One seizure of 282 g black powder.
- March 2008 – One seizure of two capsules.

Helander (2013) reported data from Sweden’s STRIDA project during its first year of operation. That project analyzes blood and urine samples from hospital cases suspected to involve novel psychoactive substance use. Over a 12-month period beginning in 2010, there were 103 emergency department cases reported to STRIDA and the only tryptamine detected was 4-HO-MET, which was seen in eight cases. The median age of users was 22 and most people took the drug orally (n=5) or intranasally (n=3). The main symptoms associated with its use were mydriasis, agitation/restlessness, tachycardia, nausea/vomiting, and hallucinations. Half of those cases originated from the same small town in southeastern Sweden.

After a year and a half of operation, STRIDA had analyzed body fluids from 189 patients, 14 of which involved 4-HO-MET (Helander, 2014). In 11 of the 14, the drug was used by itself and those cases led to minor (n=7) or moderate (n=4) symptoms, which usually resolved with supportive care, though sometimes sedatives (e.g. diazepam and/or propofol) were provided.

Surveys given to Spanish research chemical users between August 2010 and June 2011 revealed 4-HO-MET was a fairly uncommon drug (Gonzalez, 2013). Among 230 people, 2C-B and methylone were used by 80% and 40%, respectively, whereas 3% of respondents reported taking 4-HO-MET.

STRIDA’s analysis of body fluids and drug products from 173 cases between 2010 and 2015 found 4-HO-MET was detected in powder on four occasions, occurring in 2010, 2011, and 2012 (Backberg, 2018).

Sweden has historically been a major market for the drug, but interest in it significantly declined after it became a controlled substance in May 2012, based on an analysis of forum posts (Ledberg, 2015).

As of 2019, it is often still an uncontrolled substance and it remains one of the more popular RC psychedelics globally.
Show Papers(Backberg, 2018) – Analysis of drug products and body fluids by Sweden’s STRIDA project.
 
- Background 
- Clinicians who contact the Poisons Information Centre in Sweden regarding acute intoxication with suspected novel psychoactive drugs are asked to provide blood and urine for free analysis to screen for psychoactive drugs.
- 251 products and body fluids were analyzed from 173 acute intoxication cases that occurred in 2010 to 2015.
- Results 
- Of the 251, 151 (60%) were confirmed to be novel psychoactive substances. In 70% only one substance was present, while in 30% there were 2 or more substances present.
- 4-HO-MET was detected in powder form in 4 instances (occurring in 2010, 2011, and 2012).
 
(Palma-Conesa, 2017) – Review of the contents of drug samples submitted to Energy Control between 2006 and 2015.
 
- Background 
- Energy Control offers free, anonymous drug checking to people in Spain and it offers a paid drug checking service to people internationally.
- 25,296 samples were delivered between 2006 and 2015. Of those, 436 were tryptamines.
- Results 
- 4-AcO-DMT was the most commonly expected unregulated tryptamine (i.e. not psilocin, DMT, psilocybin, DET, or α-ET).
- 19 (8%) were delivered as 4-HO-MET. 
- Of these, 17 were confirmed to be 4-HO-MET, while 1 was 4-HO-DET, and 1 contained no active substance.
- Also, 4-HO-MET showed up in 1 of 2 samples delivered as 4-AcO-MET.
 
(Ledberg, 2015) – Interest in 4-HO-MET appeared to decline in Sweden after it became a controlled drug.
 
- Methods 
- Reviewing posts on Flashback.org, a large internet forum in Sweden, featuring over 850,000 members. The study aimed to see how a change in legality affected consumer interest during the preceding five years.
- 60+ substances had changed from legal to illicit during this time, but the study only looked at those which had been regularly discussed on the forum. The list was narrowed down to MDPV, methylone, 4-MEC, 4-HO-MET, MXE, 6-APB, AH-7921, and 3-MMC.
- Results 
- 4-HO-MET 
- It appears to have been introduced early in 2008 and from that point forward interest in the drug fluctuated. There were long periods of high activity, i.e. 10+ posts per day about the drug. After it was controlled as a narcotic substance on May 1, 2012, activity about the substance on the forum decreased to very low levels.
- General 
- There was a pattern for substances to be discussed far less once they were scheduled. For 7/8 substances a strong statistical association between legality change and activity on the forum was seen.
 
(Helander, 2014) – Analysis of body fluids by Sweden’s STRIDA project
 
- Results 
- From January 2010 to August 2011 (the first 1.5 years of STRIDA) there were 1147 inquiries covering >900 unique cases and in 466 patients NPS exposure was suspected. 
- Body fluids from 189 patients were received. In 97%, information was given about clinical symptoms and treatment.
- Psilocin was detected in 3 cases. Surpassing that, 4-HO-MET was detected in 14 cases. 
- In 11/14 the drug was present in a single-substance intoxication and those cases were graded as minor (n=7) or moderate (n=4) poisonings. The symptoms typically resolved with supportive care, though sometimes diazepam was used for sedation and propofol was occasionally added as well.
 
(Gonzalez, 2013) – Survey regarding novel psychoactive substance use among Spanish research chemical users
 
- A 16-question survey was created based on information obtained from 12 users who had extensive experience with RCs. The survey was given to adults legally residing in Spain who spoke Spanish as their first language and who had used an RC at least once.
- Results 
- Between August 2010 and June 2011, 230 surveys were completed. The respondents were reached via trance music festivals (44% from Boom Festival or Sol Festival), via Energy Control’s site in Barcelona (15%), or via an online drug forum called Cannabiscafe (42%).
- 2.6% of respondents reported taking 4-HO-MET. For comparison: 2C-B (80%), methylone (40%), 2C-I (40%), mephedrone (35%), 2C-E (26%), AMT (16%).
- And for drug combinations, 0.4% reported using 4-HO-MET with mephedrone. For comparison: 2C-B + MDMA (28%), 2C-B + amphetamine (7%), 2C-B + LSD (6%).
 
(Helander, 2013) – Analysis of data from Sweden’s STRIDA project during its first year of operation.
 
- Background 
- In January 2010, a joint nationwide project called STRIDA was created to address the issue of novel psychoactive drugs, partly by using multi-component LC-MS/MS to identify substances encountered in clinical settings. The project was started by the Karolinska Institutet, the Karolinska University Laboratory, and the Swedish Poisons Information Centre.
- Results 
- During its first 12 months of operation the project was notified of 103 cases where patients presented to emergency departments across the country. 
- 36% of cases involved synthetic cannabinoids, 14% involved substituted cathinones, and 4% involved kratom. In 32% the drug was listed as “unknown.”
- Substituted tryptamines 
- The only tryptamine encountered at this time was 4-HO-MET. There were eight cases, with the age range being 17-32 years old (median=22). Oral (n=5) and insufflation (n=3) were the ROA.
- The main symptoms were mydriasis, agitation/restlessness, tachycardia, nausea/vomiting, and hallucinations.
- Half of the cases originated from the same small town in southeastern Sweden.

## Legality (as of August 2019)

Australia: Not specifically controlled but it may fall under analog laws.

Canada: Uncontrolled

United Kingdom: Class A due to a general law controlling tryptamines.

United States: Unscheduled, but it will likely fall under the Federal Analogue Act when intended for human consumption.

---

## Safety

Because very little is known about its safety, it should be taken at common doses, infrequently, and without combinations.

Considering its known effects and pharmacology, its risks should be largely similar to psilocin and LSD. This means regular doses carry some potential of panic, psychosis, tachycardia, hypertension, and hyperthermia.

And overdoses can be expected to frequently trigger psychotic symptoms and more rarely they could conceivably be associated with cardiovascular complications, seizures, dangerous hyperthermia, excessive muscle tension, and kidney damage, though most of those risks are only hypothetical based on its pharmacology.

#### Adverse Effect Reports

One formal case report of psychosis was published by Taljemark (2012). It described as teenager who used ~100 mg, leading to dangerously psychotic symptoms and psychological problems that gradually improved over the course of a week in the hospital. There was no lasting negative effect, but his acute state was severe enough that different circumstances could have led to dangerous or lethal outcomes.
Show Papers(Taljemark, 2012) – A case of psychosis triggered by a 4-HO-MET overdose
 
- A 17-year-old was found in his underwear along a motorway by police. He said he would not talk to anyone and he proceeded to be mute and apathetic. He was admitted to the acute medical department. 
- Prior to this he was psychiatrically and physically well.
- Admission: Blood tests and CT head scan were normal. Urine toxicology screen was positive for THC and cocaine (cocaine had been taken two days prior). He was given supportive care.
- Evening of the admission day: After being apathetic throughout the day he jumped 3-4 m from a roof. After being found outside the hospital a CT scan showed a fractured right radius and small right-sided pneumothorax, but no intracranial pathology. A neurological exam and EEG were normal.
- He was detained and brought to the psychiatric ICU because of severe agitation and presumed suicidality. He then became apathetic again. Because he needed further supportive treatment he was brought back to the acute medical care unit.
- 2 days later: Medical condition stabilized. A psychiatric assessment showed he was mute and withdrawn. Antipsychotics were withheld due to uncertainty about the diagnosis and his already subdued state. He was admitted to the Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Emergency Unit.
- Over the next week: Gradual improvement, with social interaction normalizing, though he claimed to have retrograde amnesia.
- 11 days after admission (discharge day): No ongoing psychiatric illness detected. He explained the situation. He had received 4-HO-MET from a friend, who ordered it online, and ~100 mg was inhaled the evening preceding the admission. When he began seeing doors in the bookcase in front of him, he panicked and left the apartment. While walking the streets he perceived them being covered with a meter of water and filled with snakes. He was distressed, lonely, and felt persecuted. He sensed insects under his skin and his heart jumping out of his chest. 
- He remembered his admission to the hospital, which was followed by hearing his father’s voice repeating “you have never dared to dive,” which led to him climbing on the roof and ‘diving’ off of it to prove his father wrong.
- Acute psychosis then subsided, but he continued to be paranoid about the food and drinks he was given in the ward for several days into his admission.
- 2 months later: No evidence of residual problems, so he was discharged from outpatient services.
#### Fatalities

No fatalities primarily attributed to 4-HO-MET have been reported in the literature as of August 2019. One fatality attributed to polydrug use involving 4-HO-MET has been described, but 4-MeO-PCP may have played a larger role in that case. (McIntyre, 2015).
Show Papers(McIntyre, 2015) – Fatality associated with polydrug intoxication. Primarily attributed to 4-MeO-PCP, but 4-HO-MET was present.
 
- 54-year-old male found unresponsive in bed during a welfare check. His medical history included hypertension and substance use–he was known to take alcohol, cannabis, methamphetamine, and PCP. His mother reported he ordered 3-MeO-PCP online and during an earlier ED visit for abnormal behavior he confessed to using 3-MeO-PCP to self-treat depression.
- Autopsy showed pulmonary congestion and edema, along with foam in his mouth and airway, which were deemed consistent with acute drug intoxication.
- Toxicology 
- 4-MeO-PCP was initially detected via ELISA screening for PCP. Its presence was confirmed using MS.
- 4-HO-MET was presumptively identified from peripheral blood using data from the SWGDRUG mass spectral library and its presence was then confirmed.
- White powder residue had been collected from the decedent’s home and it was identified by the DEA as 4-AcO-MET, with neither 3-MeO-PCP nor 4-MeO-PCP detected. 
- It is suspected 4-AcO-MET rapidly hydrolyzes to free phenolic 4-HO-MET via the action of serum esterases, which could explain why 4-HO-MET was detected in body fluids, not 4-AcO-MET.
- Therapeutic concentrations of venlafaxine, olanzapine, lorazepam, and hydroxyzine were present in peripheral blood.
- Cause of death: Accidental acute mixed drug intoxication.
#### Risky Combinations (list is not exhaustive)

- Other psychedelics
- Stimulants
- MAOIs
- Tramadol

4-HO-MET, also known as 4-hydroxy-N-methyl-N-ethyltryptamine, as well as metocin or methylcybin, is a psychedelic drug of the tryptamine and 4-hydroxytryptamine families related to psilocin (4-HO-DMT). It is taken orally.
The drug acts as a non-selective serotonin receptor agonist, including of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor. It is a close structural analogue of psilocin (4-HO-DMT) and is the 4-hydroxyl analogue of methylethyltryptamine (MET).
4-HO-MET was discovered by Alexander Shulgin in the 1970s. It was first described in the literature by David Repke and colleagues in 1981. The drug was encountered as a novel recreational and designer drug by 2008.

## Use and effects

In his book TiHKAL (Tryptamines I Have Known and Loved), Alexander Shulgin lists the dose range of 4-HO-MET as 10 to 20 mg orally and its duration as 4 to 6 hours. However, a wider recreational dose range of 2 to 45 mg or more orally, with a typical dose estimate of 15 mg, has also been reported. The drug's onset is said to be within 30 minutes.
The effects of 4-HO-MET have been reported to include pupil dilation, euphoria, tingling sensations, perceptual changes, closed- and open-eye visuals, synesthesia, time dilation, intensified perceptions, thoughts, and feelings, and a general change in thought processes. Other specific effects include alteration of color and form, feeling sounds, and a wave-like experience with alternation between near-normal perception one moment and a "swirl of altered concept" the next moment.
4-HO-MET is said to produce qualitative effects very similar to those of psilocin. Shulgin has stated that he doubts it could be distinguished from psilocin in any blinded clinical study. However, the drug has also been described as being relatively or very light, more clear-headed and functional, and having less head space. On the other hand, it is said to still produce strong psychedelic visuals. This profile of effects has been described as being analogous to the case of 2C-B.
In addition to its use on its own, 4-HO-MET, along with the related tryptamine psychedelic 5-MeO-MiPT, is employed at low doses as a component of the MDMA-mimicking Borax combo.

## Interactions

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

4-HO-MET binds to various serotonin receptors and is known to act as an agonist of the serotonin 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, 5-HT2C, and 5-HT1A receptors. It is thought that the hallucinogenic effects of serotonergic psychedelics like 4-HO-MET are mediated by serotonin 5-HT2A receptor activation.

### Pharmacokinetics

The metabolism of 4-HO-MET has been studied.

## Chemistry

4-HO-MET, also known as 4-hydroxy-N-methyl-N-ethyltryptamine, is a substituted tryptamine and 4-hydroxytryptamine. It is the 4-hydroxy derivative of N-methyl-N-ethyltryptamine (MET) and is a close analogue of psilocin (4-hydroxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine; 4-HO-DMT).

### Synthesis

The chemical synthesis of 4-HO-MET has been described.

### Analogues

Analogues of 4-HO-MET include psilocin (4-HO-DMT), 4-HO-DET (ethocin), 4-HO-MiPT (miprocin), 4-HO-DPT (deprocin), 4-HO-MPT (meprocin), 4-HO-DALT (dalocin), and 4-HO-MALT (malocin), among others. 4-AcO-MET (metacetin) is an ester prodrug of 4-HO-MET.

## History

4-HO-MET was first synthesized and discovered by Alexander Shulgin in the 1970s. It was first described in the scientific literature by David Repke and colleagues by 1981. Subsequently, 4-HO-MET was described by Shulgin in his book TiHKAL (Tryptamines I Have Known and Loved) in 1997 as being- aside from it's synthesis- indistinguishable from any other ethyl homologue. It was encountered as a novel recreational and designer drug in Europe by 2008.

## Society and culture

### Legal status

#### Finland

Scheduled in the "government decree on psychoactive substances banned from the consumer market".

#### Germany

4-HO-MET is ruled under the Neue-psychoaktive-Stoffe-Gesetz (NpSG) since July 18, 2019. Production and Import with intent to distribute is punishable. Possession is forbidden but not punishable, although ordering it in small quantities can still be seen as an intent to distribute it and be punished.
4-Propionoxy-N-methyl-N-ethyltryptamine (also referred to as 4-PrO-MET) is the ester prodrug of 4-HO-MET. Unlike many other tryptamine derivatives, it is currently not explicitly listed under the German Neue-psychoaktive-Stoffe-Gesetz (NpSG). This means that, while its use as a recreational substance is not legally permitted, the compound may be obtained and handled for legitimate research purposes, provided all other relevant legal requirements and safety regulations are observed.

#### Sweden

The Swedish Riksdag added 4-HO-MET to Schedule I ("substances, plant materials and fungi which normally do not have medical use") as narcotics in Sweden as of May 1, 2012, published by Medical Products Agency in their regulation LVFS 2012:6.

#### United Kingdom

4-HO-MET is a class A drug in the United Kingdom, as a result of the tryptamine catch-all clause.

#### United States

4-HO-MET is not scheduled at the federal level in the United States, but it is possible that it could be considered an analogue of psilocin, in which case purchase, sale, or possession could be prosecuted under the Federal Analogue Act.
It is a schedule I substance in some states, such as South Dakota and West Virginia.
