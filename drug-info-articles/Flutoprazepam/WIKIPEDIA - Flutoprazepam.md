*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flutoprazepam*

Flutoprazepam (Restas) is a drug which is a benzodiazepine. It was patented in Japan by Sumitomo in 1972 and its medical use remains mostly confined to that country. Its muscle relaxant properties are approximately equivalent to those of diazepam - however, it has more powerful sedative, hypnotic, anxiolytic and anticonvulsant effects and is around four times more potent by weight compared to diazepam. It is longer acting than diazepam due to its long-acting active metabolites, which contribute significantly to its effects.  Its principal active metabolite is n-desalkylflurazepam, also known as norflurazepam, which is also a principal metabolite of flurazepam (trade name Dalmadorm/Dalmane).
Flutoprazepam is typically used for the treatment of severe insomnia and may also be used for treating stomach ulcers.
Flutoprazepam does not fall under the international Convention on Psychotropic Substances of 1971, and is currently unscheduled in the United States.
