# 5-APB
*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5-APB*

5-APB, also known as 5-(2-aminopropyl)benzofuran, is an entactogen of the phenethylamine, amphetamine, and benzofuran families. 5-APB and related drugs have sometimes been informally called "Benzofury".
5-APB was first described in the scientific literature in 2000 and emerged as a novel designer drug in 2010.

## Use and effects

Users describe the effects of 5-APB as including euphoria among others. Largely, its effects reported were similar to those of the drug MDMA but not as strong. The drug has been reported to produce visual disturbances and is said to have mild psychedelic effects.
Recreational use of 5-APB has been associated with death in combination with other drugs and solely as the result of 5-APB.

## Interactions

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

5-APB acts as a serotonin–norepinephrine–dopamine releasing agent (SNDRA), with EC50Tooltip half-maximal effective concentration values for monoamine release of 19 nM for serotonin, 21 nM for norepinephrine, and 31 nM for dopamine in rat brain synaptosomes. It is also a serotonin–norepinephrine–dopamine reuptake inhibitor (SNDRI).
5-APB is a potent agonist of the serotonin 5-HT2A and 5-HT2B receptors. Its EC50Tooltip half-maximal effective concentration (EmaxTooltip maximal efficacy) values were 6,300 nM (54%) at the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor and 280 nM (61–92%) at the serotonin 5-HT2B receptor. It also shows affinity for the serotonin 5-HT2C receptor (Ki = 880 nM) and the serotonin 5-HT1A receptor (Ki = 3,300 nM). It has been reported to act as an agonist of the serotonin 5-HT2C receptor similarly to the serotonin 5-HT2A and 5-HT2B receptors. The drug's potent agonism of the serotonin 5-HT2B receptor makes it likely that 5-APB would be cardiotoxic with long-term use, as seen with other serotonin 5-HT2B receptor agonists such as fenfluramine and MDMA.
5-APB also shows high affinity for the mouse and rat trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1).
In animal studies, 5-APB produces robust hyperlocomotion, robust conditioned place preference (CPP) but limited self-administration, fully substitutes for MDMA in drug discrimination tests, and partially substitutes for DOM, cocaine, and methamphetamine in drug discrimination tests.

## Chemistry

5-APB, also known as 5-(2-aminopropyl)benzofuran, is a phenethylamine, amphetamine, and benzofuran and an analogue of 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA).

### Properties

5-APB is commonly found as the succinate and hydrochloride salt. The hydrochloride salt is 10% more potent by mass and doses should be adjusted accordingly.

### Synthesis

The chemical synthesis of 5-APB has been described.

### Detection

A forensic standard of 5-APB is available, and the compound has been posted on the Forendex website of potential drugs of abuse. The US Department of Justice and DEA have also conducted studies concerning the detection of 5-APB.

### Analogues

Analogues of 5-APB include MDA, 5-APDB, 5-MAPB, 6-APB, 5-APBT, and 5-API, among others.

## History

5-APB, along with 6-APB, was first described in the scientific literature by Karin Briner and colleagues at Eli Lilly and Company in a patent in 2000. They were specifically studied as serotonin 5-HT2C receptor agonists for potential medical applications at this time. The description of 5-APB and 6-APB in the literature had followed the earlier work on 5-APDB and 6-APDB as serotonin releasing agents and entactogens by David E. Nichols and colleagues at Purdue University in 1993. 5-APB, along with 6-APB, emerged as a novel designer drug in 2010. 5-APB and 6-APB are often confused with 5-APDB and 6-APDB.

## Society and culture

### Legal status

#### United Kingdom

On March 5, 2014 the UK Home Office announced that 5-APB would be made a class B drug on 10 June 2014 alongside every other benzofuran entactogen and many structurally related drugs.
