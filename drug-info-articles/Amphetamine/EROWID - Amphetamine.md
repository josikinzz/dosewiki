DESCRIPTION #
 
[Amphetamine Images](https://erowid.org/amphetamines_images.shtml)
 
Amphetamines include both the specific chemical 'amphetamine' and the general class of chemicals which share structural similaries. Amphetamines generally cause strong physical and mental stimulation, keeping users awake and alert for many hours, and some amphetamines cause mood lift / euphoria. Because they increase wakefulness, various amphetamines have been used by the military, by pilots, truck drivers, and other workers to keep functioning past their normal limits. 
 
 Amphetamines are also used to treat Attention Deficit Disorder and can have the seemingly paradoxical effect of quieting and calming users. Common amphetamines include Dexedrine (d-amphetamine), methamphetamine, and adderall (dl-amphetamine). Substantial amounts of pharmaceutical amphetamines are diverted from medical use to recreational and work-related uses and methamphetamine is produced in huge quantities in underground labs around the world.

[History](https://erowid.org/amphetamines_timeline.php) #
 
Amphetamine was first synthesized by German chemist L. Edeleano in 1887 (originally named phenylisopropylamine). In the 1930's amphetamines were first marketed as 'benzedrine' in an over-the-counter inhaler to treat congestion and in the late 30's, amphetamine was prescribed for the treatment of narcolepsy and ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder). Amphetamine use grew rapidly when amphetamines were distributed to soldiers during World War II. In 1971, amphetamines were scheduled in the United States and prescriptions became required for possession.

DESCRIPTION #
 
Amphetamines are stimulants that affect the central nervous system. Medically they are used to treat depression, obesity, and other conditions. 
 
 In addition to the physical effects of amphetamines, users report feeling restless, anxious and moody. Increased doses intensify the effects, and users may become excited or talkative and experience a false sense of self-confidence or superiority. They may behave in a bizarre manner; some become aggressive and hostile. 
 
 Prolonged use of amphetamines can lead to malnutrition and vitamin deficiencies, skin disorders, ulcers, lack of sleep, weight loss and depression. Frequent use of large amounts of amphetamines can cause brain damage that results in speech and thought disturbances. 
 
 Note: "Speed" is used to refer to amphetamine, methamphetamine, methylphenidate (Ritalin), and other strong stimulants that feel something like amphetamine. 
 
 
Addiction and Withdrawal #
 Users of large amounts of amphetamines over a long period of time can develop an amphetamine psychosis, which is a mental disorder similar to paranoid schizophrenia. The psychosis is manifested by hallucinations, delusions, and paranoia. Bizarre, sometime violent, behavior is exhibited by those with amphetamine psychosis. Symptoms usually disappear within a few weeks after drug use stops. 
 
 
Withdrawal Symptoms
 Amphetamines have the potential to produce tolerance, which means that increased amounts of the drug are needed to achieve the desired effects. Withdrawal symptoms can occur when use of amphetamines is stopped abruptly. Users may experience fatigue; long, disturbed periods of sleep; irritability; intense hunger, and moderate to severe depression. The length and severity of the depression is related to how much and how often amphetamines were used. 
 
 
- craving exhaustion depression mental confusion restlessness and insomnia deep or disturbed sleep lasting up to 48 hours extreme hunger psychotic reaction anxiety reactions
 
Treatment (from [FADAA](http://www.fadaa.org/resource/justfact/amphetamines.html) )
 Medical treatments include the use of antidepressant agents such as imipramine, desipramine, amitriptyline, dosepin, trazodone, or fluoxetine (Prozac). These affect serotonin, the neurotransmitter in the brain that deals with both depression and drug craving. 
 
 Sedatives such as Dalmane, chloral hydrate, Librium, phenobarbital, or even Valium are used, very carefully, on a short-term basis to treat anxiety or sleep disturbance problems. Antipsychotic medications such as Haldol, [Thorazine](https://erowid.org/pharms/chlorpromazine/chlorpromazine.shtml) , and others are also used to buffer the effects of unbalanced dopamine, the neurotransmitter that moderates paranoia and pleasurable sensation. 
 
 In addition to treating the physical and psychological aspects of craving, treatment providers should stress group counseling and peer pressure for compulsive amphetamine users, as these forms of therapy work well for this population. 
 
 
Effects of use During Pregnancy #
 It is possible for babies of mothers who use amphetamines to be born with: 
 
 
- cardiac defects cleft palate birth defects addiction and withdrawal
 
Overdose #
 (from PDR 1998's amphetamine prescription information) 
 Individual patient response to amphetamines varies widely. While toxic symptoms occasionally occur as an idiosyncracy at dosages as low as 2 mg, they are rare with doses of less than 15 mg; 30 mg can produce severe reactions, yet doses of 400 to 500 mg are not necessarily fatal. In rats, the oral LD50 of dextroamphetamine sulfate is 96.8 mg/kg. 
 
 
Symptoms
 Manifestations of acute overdosage with amphetamines include restlessness, tremor, hyperreflexia, rapid respiration, confusion, assaultiveness, hallucinations, panic states, hyperpyrexia, and rhabdomyolysis. 
 
 Fatigue and depression usually follow the central stimulation. 
 
 Cardiovascular effects include arrhythmias, hypertension or hypotension, and circulatory collapse. 
 
 Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal cramps. Fatal poisoning is usually preceded by convulsions and coma. 
 
 
Treatment
 Consult with a Certified Poison Control Center for up-to-date guidance and advice. Management of acute amphetamine intoxication is largely symptomatic and includes gastric lavage, administration of activated charcoal, administration of a cathartic and sedation. Experience with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is inadequate to permit recommendation in this regard. Acidification of the urine increases amphetamine excretion, but is believed to increase risk of acute renal failure if myoglobinuria is present. If acute, severe hypertension complicates amphetamine overdosage, administration of intravenous phentolamine (Regitine (r) CIBA) has been suggested. However a gradual drop in blood pressure will usually result when sufficient sedation has been achieved. Chlorpromazine antagonizes the central stimulation effects of amphetamines and can be used to treat amphetamine intoxication.
 
CAUTION & DISCLAIMER #
 
Erowid's effects information is a summary of data gathered from users, research, and other resources. This information is intended to describe the range of effects people report experiencing. Effects may vary dramatically from one person to another or one experience to another based on a variety of factors such as body chemistry, age, gender, physical health, dose, form of material, etc.

Amphetamine (& Methamphetamine)
 
Health Issues
 
by Erowid
 
---
 
 The health concerns for most amphetamine-like substances, including methamphetamine, are largely the same. Each has its own risk and toxicity profile. Street methamphetamine provides the additional risks of black market, unregulated medications; potential contaminants or adulteration; the potential of neurotoxicity and a higher risk of compulsive use associated with snorting, smoking, or injecting. 
 
 Frequency: unknown, rare, uncommon, common, very common, typical. 
 Certainty: unknown, little direct evidence, some evidence, case reports only, medium / link established, high / clear causation. 
 
 
 
Health risks and problems associated with amphetamine use:
 
- Agitation, Inability to Concentrate : In some users, increasing with dose, amphetamine causes agitation, restlessness, and inability to concentrate or focus. 
 
Frequency: uncommon, increasing with dose.
 
Certainty: clear causation.
- Cardiovascular Stress : Increased heart rate and blood pressure. Tachycardia (fast heart) and palpitations are common at high doses. 
 
Frequency: very common.
 
Certainty: clear causation.
- Heart Attack & Hypertensive Crisis : With higher doses and for vulnerable individuals, Cardiovascular Stress can precipitate severe hypertensive crises and Heart Attacks. 
 
Frequency: uncommon.
 
Certainty: clear causation.
- Stroke : Increases risk of stroke as dose increases. 
 
Frequency: unknown.
 
Certainty: medium. [ Kaku 1990 , Lambrecht 1993 ]
- Overheating : High doses can cause overheating (hyperthermia) which can be dangerous in certain environments or for vulnerable people. 
 
Frequency: common.
 
Certainty: clear causation.
- Poor Sleep Quality : Mild sleep disruptions are very common and include difficulty falling asleep and poor sleep quality. 
 
Frequency: typical.
 
Certainty: clear causation.
- Sleep Deprivation : Repeated dosing can lead to lack of sleep for days on end, resulting in cognitive impairment, poor judgement, confusion, hallucinations, and paranoia. 
 
Frequency: typical with repeated dosing.
 
Certainty: clear causation.
- Bad Driving : Lack of sleep can lead to impaired judgement and poor driving. 
 
Frequency: common with sleep deprivation.
 
Certainty: link established.
- Poor Diet : Reduced appetite and reduced enjoyment of eating can lead to poor diet which, over time, can lead to poor general health, oral health and skin tone, and increased physical and mental stress. 
 
Frequency: common with chronic use.
 
Certainty: clear causation.
- Stress & Oxidative Damage : Methamphetamine causes stress to the body and mind and causes an increase in oxidative stress in blood and tissues. At very high doses and frequencies of use, organ damage and premature aging may occur. 
 
Frequency: common.
 
Certainty: some evidence.
- Damage to Teeth and Gums # : Jaw tension can lead to teeth grinding (bruxia/bruxism) and permanent wear and cracking. Long-term use of amphetamines can result in tooth rot ( [dental caries](http://www.db.od.mah.se/car/data/cariesser.html) ) and loss of teeth. [ Shaner 2002 ] Regular amphetamine use can lead to gingivitis (inflammation of the gums). This may be the result of prolonged dry mouth which can cause the gums to become inflamed, worsening oral health. [ Hasan 2004 ]. 
 
Frequency: common.
 
Certainty: link established.
- Paranoia : Using recreational (higher) doses of amphetamines more than once per day or for several days in a row can cause mild to moderate paranoid ideation in some users. The paranoid thinking can cause lasting problems and the paranoia can sometimes last for days or weeks after use ceases. Regular amphetamine use (and lack of sleep) can cause paranoid, delusional thinking and sometimes auditory and visual hallucinations (usually barely audible or on the periphery of vision). Chronic, high dose use may lead to long term mental health problems. [ Nurse's PDR 2005 ] 
 
Frequency: uncommon.
 
Certainty: some evidence [self reports].
- Risky Sex : Euphoria, altered mental state, and altered sense of control at recreational doses can lead to risky sexual behavior. [ Self Reports ] 
 
Frequency: unknown.
 
Certainty: some evidence [self reports].
- Dry Mucus Membranes : Dried mucus membranes can lead to bloody noses, painful sinus dryness, and increased likelihood of sinus infections. 
 
Frequency: common.
 
Certainty: link established.
- Dry Skin, Picking at the Skin : Regular amphetamine use is associated with a drying of the skin and increased itchyness. Obsessively picking or pulling at the skin (sometimes until it bleeds) is reported in many people after higher dose, frequent use of methamphetamine. 
 
Frequency: unknown.
 
Certainty: some evidence [self reports].
- Neurotoxicity (Methamphetamine): At high doses, methamphetamine causes damage to dopamine and serotonin neurons in the brain [ Seiden 1976 , Thompson 2004 ]. Long term use may lead to noticeable neurological and behavioral problems. This effect is well documented with methamphetamine in mice and now largely confirmed in humans; behavioral/clinical effects of this damage is not well documented in humans [ Hanson 2004 ]. 
 
Frequency: unknown.
 
Certainty: link established in rodents, exact nature unclear in humans.
- Neurotoxicity (D/L-Amphetamine): Neurotoxicity with D/L amphetamine (most of what is prescribed as medications) is not as well documented, but at very high doses and frequencies, neurotoxicity does occur in mice and rats. [ Jonsson 1982 ] 
 
Frequency: unknown.
 
Certainty: unknown.
- Rhabdomyolysis and Kidney Damage : Breakdown of muscle fibers usually caused by overheating and overstimulation. High-dose use can result in rhabdomyolysis, causing large amounts of proteins to be released into the blood. Urine becomes dark as the rhabdomyolysis increases and the kidneys can suffer mild to severe damage. [ Chan 1994 , Lan 1998 ]. 
 
Frequency: rare.
 
Certainty: some direct evidence.
- Dangerous to combine with other stimulants : Amphetamines used with MDMA appear to cause damage to the dopamine neurons in the brain [ Reneman 2002 ]. Amphetamines combined with other stimulants can substantially increase the risk of dangerous hyperthermia (overheating), rhabdomyolysis (breakdown of muscles), and other related health problems. 
 
Frequency: uncommon.
 
Certainty: clear causation.
- Death : Usually resuling from cardiac arrest, stroke, or hyperthermia. Acute renal failure associated with rhabdomyolysis, acidosis, and ischemic renal failure also is associated with methamphetamine fatalities. Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation also reported. [ Lan 1998 ]. 
 
Frequency: rare.
 
Certainty: clear causation.
 
 
Health benefits associated with amphetamine use:
 
- Reduced Appetite : Although still prescribed to aid in weight loss, the recognized cardiovascular risks of using amphetamines now make their prescription for weight loss far less common than in the past. The prevalence of "weight loss only" non-prescription use of amphetamines is impossible to gauge. 
 
Frequency: typical.
 
Certainty: clear causation.
- Attention Deficit Disorder : Amphetamines are widely prescribed for use in treating moderate to severe cases of Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD) in both children and adults. Attention-improving doses tend to be low doses (3-20 mg of amphetamine or methamphetamine oral), although dosages are higher for tolerated individuals. 
 
Frequency: effective for some.
 
Certainty: link established.
- Attention / Wakefulness : In low doses and used infrequently, amphetamine increases wakefulness and attentiveness in users. It is used by truckers, the military, and others who need to stay awake for long periods of time. Wakefulness can be important for safety when operating machinery. 
 
Frequency: typical.
 
Certainty: link established.
- Dry Mucus Membranes : Dried mucus membranes can reduce allergy and cold symptoms. 
 
Frequency: common. Certainty: link established.
 
 
Warnings:
 
- Do not take amphetamines if you are using, or have used an [MAO Inhibitor](https://erowid.org/../maois/maois.shtml) within the last 2 weeks.
- Regular or frequent amphetamine use can lead to dependence.
- Regular amphetamine users experience tolerance and require increased dosages to achieve the same level of effects.

Amphetamine
 
Legal Status
 
by Erowid
 
U.S. FEDERAL LAW #
 
Caution : All legal information should be verified through other sources. [ see below ]
 
**U.S. FEDERAL LEGAL SUMMARY**
**Amphetamine**
- REGULATED: Yes
- STATUS: Scheduled
- SCHEDULE: Schedule II
- CLASSIFICATION: Stimulant
 
Amphetamine is Schedule II in the United States. This means it is illegal to sell without a DEA license and illegal to buy or possess without a license or prescription.
 
INTERNATIONAL LAW #
 
Brazil #
 
Amphetamines are schedule A3, requiring a prescription for purchase and a license to sell. We have been told that they can sometimes be purchased without a prescription, though this is illegal. See [http://www.anvisa.gov.br/divulga/informes/2009/Resolu%E7%E3o%20RDC%2040_nova.pdf?id=35907&word](http://www.anvisa.gov.br/divulga/informes/2009/Resolu%E7%E3o%20RDC%2040_nova.pdf?id=35907&word) and [http://www.anvisa.gov.br/medicamentos/controlados/conceito.htm](http://www.anvisa.gov.br/medicamentos/controlados/conceito.htm) . (thanks RM, P) (last updated July 3 2011)
 
Canada #
 
In Aug 2005, Canada reinstated sales of Adderall XR after banning their sales in Feb 2005. See [Health Canada News Release Allowing Adderall XR back on market](http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/ahc-asc/media/nr-cp/2005/2005_92_e.html) and [BBC](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/4253159.stm) . Immediate release Adderall is not approved for sale in Canada. Amphetamine is Schedule I in Canada (was Schedule III until 2012). (Note: Canadian schedules are very different than U.S. schedules). (last updated Oct 1 2012)
 
China #
 
Amphetamine is disallowed as a prescription drug in China, with a limited exception for tourists carrying prescriptions in from other countries. Chinese pharmacies do not carry amphetamine-based medicines. It is possible for longer term visitors to have prescriptions imported by mail, but this requires complex paperwork and administrative approval. Taiwan is reportedly more lenient, but amphetamine prescription drugs are still unavailable. (unconfirmed) (thanks J) (last updated May 12, 2013)
 
Germany #
 
Amphetamine is BTM Anlage 3 in Germany making it illegal to possess without a BTM prescription. (unconfirmed) (thanks PM)
 
Israel #
 
Israel banned four "families" of substances and their derivatives in July 2010. The families are cathinones, methcathinones, amphetamines, and methamphetamines. The new rules are designed to preemptively ban new drugs before they are sold in Israel. See [http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Article.aspx?id=181254](http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Article.aspx?id=181254) . (Thanks A) (last updated May 12 2011)
 
New Zealand #
 
Amphetamine was recategorized from class B2 to the stricter class B1 controlled substance on Aug 2 2005. See [legislation.govt.nz](http://www.legislation.govt.nz/libraries/contents/om_isapi.dll?clientID=1617376191&infobase=pal_regs.nfo&jump=reg-nzl-pub-y.2005-229%7eend%7eexplan.%211&softpage=DOC) . (thanks M)
 
Norway #
 
Amphetamine is Schedule II in Norway and illegal to buy or possess without a prescription. [See Norway Law](https://erowid.org/psychoactives/law/countries/countries.shtml#norway) . (thanks Y)
 
Poland #
 
Amphetamine is included in the Appendix II-P group of Poland's Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Law, making it illegal to buy, sell, possess, or use. (thanks T)
 
Portugal #
 
Effective July 2001, personal use of amphetamine without a prescription was decriminalized by Law 30/2000 (see [text of law](https://erowid.org/psychoactives/law/countries/portugal/lei30-2000.pdf) ). Possession of less than 1 g is not regarded as a criminal offense, though the substance is liable to be seized and the possessor can be referred to mandatory treatment. Sale, or possession of quantities greater than the personal possession limit, are criminal offenses punishable by jail time. (thanks P)
