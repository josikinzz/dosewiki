## Overview

### Description

This compound belongs to the class of organic compounds known as phenanthrenes and derivatives. These are polycyclic compounds containing a phenanthrene moiety, which is a tricyclic aromatic compound with three non-linearly fused benzene.

### Background

Naloxone is an opioid antagonist medication used to block or reverse the effects of opioid drugs, particularly within the setting of drug overdoses which are rapidly becoming a leading cause of death worldwide.
3
More specifically, naloxone has a high affinity for μ-opioid receptors, where it acts as an inverse agonist, causing the rapid removal of any other drugs bound to these receptors.
3
When taken in large quantities, opioid medications such as
morphine
,
hydromorphone
,
methadone
,
heroin
, or
fentanyl
are capable of causing life-threatening symptoms such as respiratory depression, reduced heart rate, slurred speech, drowsiness, and constricted pupils.
3
,
13
If untreated, this can progress to vomiting, absent pulse and breathing, loss of consciousness, and even death.
13
Naloxone is indicated for the rapid reversal of these symptoms of central nervous system depression in opioid overdose.
2
It's important to note that naloxone only works on opioid receptors within the body, and is therefore not capable of reversing the effects of non-opioid medications such as stimulants like
methamphetamine
or
cocaine
, or benzodiazepines like
lorazepam
or
diazepam
.
Also known as the brand name product Narcan, naloxone is currently available by intramuscular (IM) or subcutaneous (SubQ) injection, nasal spray, or intravenous (IV) infusion.
14
,
16
Naloxone IM injections are commonly available in the form of "kits", which is ideal for making overdose treatment accessible and readily available for administration by minimally trained individuals within the community.
15
Kits commonly include the supplies necessary to treat an overdose in a non-medical setting such as alcohol swabs, syringes, a rescue breathing mask, and instructions for use. Frequently also carried by medical and emergency personnel and at events known to be associated with heavy drug use like music festivals, naloxone kits are considered a key component of harm reduction strategies. There are over-the-counter nasal sprays available.
When injected intramuscularly (IM), naloxone acts within three to five minutes. Administration of naloxone is associated with very few side effects. Notably, if injected into a person not currently using opioid medications, there would be no noticeable effects at all. However, for individuals using opioid medications or experiencing an overdose, IM injection of naloxone rapidly reverses opioid effects and can cause the injected individual to immediately experience withdrawal symptoms.
2
Common symptoms of opioid withdrawal include nausea, vomiting, sweating, runny nose, aches, and diarrhea.
2
Although certainly physically uncomfortable, opioid withdrawal symptoms are not life-threatening; administration of naloxone is, therefore, appropriate for any person appearing to have any symptoms of an opioid overdose. Due to its short duration of action, persons injected with naloxone should be monitored for responsiveness and potentially injected a second time or taken to the hospital.
2
Naloxone is also available within the combination product Suboxone with the opioid medication
buprenorphine
.
11
,
12
Suboxone is used for the maintenance treatment of opioid dependence and addiction.
11
,
12
When taken orally, naloxone has no pharmacological effect and does not reduce the effectiveness of the opioid effect of buprenorphine.
11
,
12
The primary purpose of including naloxone within Suboxone is to act as a deterrent to injection, as injected naloxone would rapidly reverse the effects of buprenorphine.
11
,
12
Naloxone was granted FDA approval on 13 April 1971.
10

### Indication

Naloxone nasal sprays are indicated for the reversal of an opioid overdose or suspected opioid overdose: it is intended for immediate administration as emergency therapy in settings where opioids may be present.
7
,
20
Intramuscular, intravenous, and subcutaneous injections are indicated for complete or partial reversal of opioid depression, diagnosis of known or suspected opioid overdose, and as an adjunct therapy in the treatment of septic shock.
16
Sublingual tablets and films are formulated with
buprenorphine
for the treatment of opioid dependence.
11
,
12
Naloxone is also formulated with
pentazocine
as an oral tablet for severe pain.
17
Intramuscular or subcutaneous naloxone autoinjectors are used for the emergency treatment of people 12 years of age and older where the use of high-potency opioids such as fentanyl analogues as a chemical weapon, is suspected.
18
,
19
Naloxone has been used off-label for the treatment of neuraxial opioid-induced pruritus.
5

### Pharmacodynamics

Naloxone is an opioid receptor antagonist indicated in the reversal of opioid overdoses.
7
Naloxone has a shorter duration of action than opioids and multiple doses may be required.
3
,
7
The therapeutic window of naloxone is wide, as it has no effect if a patient has not taken opioids.
4
,
7
Patients treated with naloxone may experience opioid withdrawal and a person administering naloxone should be aware that reversal of opioid overdoses may not resolve all the symptoms a patient is experiencing if other drugs are involved.

### Mechanism of Action

Mu-type opioid receptor
Antagonist
Delta-type opioid receptor
Antagonist
Kappa-type opioid receptor
Antagonist

### Absorption

An intranasal dose of naloxone is 42-47% bioavailable.
7
An 8 mg dose of nasal naloxone reaches a C
max
of 12.3-12.8 ng/mL, with a T
max
of 0.25 hours, and an AUC of 16.7-19.0 h*ng/mL.
7
A 0.4 mg intramuscular dose reaches a C
max
of 0.876-0.910 ng/mL, with a T
max
of 0.25 hours, and an AUC of 1.94-1.95 h*ng/mL.
7
A 2 mg intravenous dose reaches a C
max
of 26.2 ng/mL with an AUC of 12.8 h*ng/mL.
7

### Metabolism

Naloxone primarily undergoes glucuronidation to form naloxone-3-glucuronide.
7
Naloxone is also N-dealkylated to noroxymorphone or undergoes 6-keto reduction to naloxol.

### General Function

Translocates drugs and phospholipids across the membrane (PubMed:2897240, PubMed:35970996, PubMed:8898203, PubMed:9038218, PubMed:35507548). Catalyzes the flop of phospholipids from the cytoplasmic to the exoplasmic leaflet of the apical membrane. Participates mainly to the flop of phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, beta-D-glucosylceramides and sphingomyelins (PubMed:8898203). Energy-dependent efflux pump responsible for decreased drug accumulation in multidrug-resistant cells (PubMed:2897240, PubMed:35970996, PubMed:9038218)
