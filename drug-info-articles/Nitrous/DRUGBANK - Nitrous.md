# Nitrous oxide
*Source: https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB06690*

## Overview

### Description

This compound belongs to the class of inorganic compounds known as other non-metal nitrides. These are inorganic compounds of nitrogen where nitrogen has a formal oxidation state of -3, and the heaviest atom bonded to it belongs to the class of 'other non-metals'.

### Background

Nitrous oxide, commonly known as "laughing gas", is a chemical compound with the chemical formula N2O. At room temperature, it is a colorless non-flammable gas, with a pleasant, slightly sweet odor and taste. It is used in surgery and dentistry for its anesthetic and analgesic effects. It is known as "laughing gas" due to the euphoric effects of inhaling it, a property that has led to its recreational use as an inhalant drug.

### Mechanism of action

Findings to date indicate that nitrous oxide induces opioid peptide release in the brain stem leading to the activation of descending noradrenergic neurones, which results in modulation of the nociceptive process in the spinal cord. Several receptor–effector mechanisms including dopamine receptors, α2 adrenoceptors, benzodiazepine receptors and -methyl- -aspartate (NMDA) receptors have been implicated although the relationship of one with the other is not known.
