*Warning: Methoxetamine has not been studied in animals let alone humans or otherwise really at all, and does seem to have somewhat addictive properties in some users.  Please use caution 

- any major dude*

**Warning:** Due to the current popularity of Methoxetamine these threads are attracting a lot of attention. Some of this attention is welcome, in the form of harm reduction, usage tips and general information about the drug. Some of it is not..


This is **NOT** a social thread. Please keep all discussion here about Methoxetamine. This can be questions about dosage, usage, different ROAs etc, suggestions for other users, you can post a link to a trip report you've just submitted, or write some brief notes about what you think of the drug having tried it (no live trip reports though). Social chatter, and "I'm tripping balls right now!" posts belong in [The Social Thread](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/598177-PD-Social-Cross-dimensional-chatter.-Now-featuring-mesphereomeantoliopeme.) or the [Drug Culture](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/forums/76-Drug-Culture) forum, or your appropriate regional forum.


If people start using this thread as a social thread again, all such posts will be deleted, and you will be given an informal warning over PM. If you continue to ignore that any continued such posts will be treated as spam and dealt with accordingly. ~Jesusgreen


Some of the latest posts from the previous thread... I have folded up some of mr Meowfish's posts since they are big reads..


***The topic of 'today' seems to be batch discussion (continuously even), and what MXE use/abuse does to a person, especially long-term risk, I would like to point out that we have subthreads especially dedicated for that in the list higher up in this post, please use it, we don't make subthreads for nothing. Though I am unsure if we need an extra one for long-term effects just like there is for ketamine? Or does it fit neatly in "adverse effects" and/or "addiction"? Let's have your opinion***:

It's really hard to stupid how much I think about it and how desperate my friends crave it now too. The price is too high...5-7x the price it used to be and I feel like it ruins me and brings me back too life at the same time. 4 hospitalizations from collapsing...minor but could of been serious injuries. Doses always over 50-100 mg sub or recital was only good spot for me. Couple weeks off it everyone in my community knows me as a drug addict now so I'm moving... Really hope I can get over this substance. Hope everyone keeps it under control ![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif)

> I will agree with the Discussion going on now about the different Downsides to long term, or shorter term binge use of MXE. It definitely has it's issues that it can cause - I completely agree with the Bi-Polar statement for the most part. I don't think that MXE actually CAUSES Bi-Polar Disorder - But I do believe that people who naturally already HAVE Bi-Polar Disorder, once they try it - can tend to be drawn into this drug more than your "Normal" Person / Drug User. I'm Bi-Polar myself - and I definitely notice MXE adding to my Manic Episodes, making them last longer, making sleep harder and breeding Insomnia even more. For me tho - this isn't necessarily a bad thing......I tend to be on the WAY more depressive end of things, where I feel like shit about myself and lay in bed for 2 weeks without getting up or barely eating food because I feel so Discouraged about Life, My Future, the TERRIBLE State of the World We ALL Live in.
> 
> 
> 
> Thinking about and dwelling on those things isn't healthy behavior. Letting the Depressive side of Manic Depression get the best of you fucking sucks, and is goddamn MISERABLE. To me as a person who's suffered their Entire Life from DEEP bouts with Depression and then finding out in my early 20's that I was Bi-Polar and that it ran in my family.............I've tried at least 10-15 Different Varieties of Medications for Depression and for Bi-Polar, as well as some Meds for Schizophrenia - as sometimes I can get so bad that I start to Hallucinate and have very Delusional Thoughts. 
>

> 
> I've spent the last 10+ YEARS of my Life, trying to find some form of Balance - some form of Lifestyle, or Drug, or Supplement, or Vitamin - I AM and WAS SO WILLING to try ANYTHING that would Stop the Pain and Suffering of the Depression, and to stop the Mood Swings, Delusions, and Mania of Bi-Polar. NOT ONE CURRENTLY MADE Anti-Depressant or Bi-Polar Medication is even CLOSE TO ACTUALLY EFFECTIVELY TREATING THE DISEASE in my Opinion - and in my personal life, at least for me, this has been proven. I've tried multiple SSRI's, I've tried multiple SNRI's, I've tried Lithium, I've tried Depakote, I've tried Seroquel - I've been prescribed Benzodiazepines Daily since I was 20, Xanex, Valium, Ativan, Klonopin.............I've been thru the Pill Mill that are, Psychiatrists and Big Pharma - they've got something to supposedly fix everything, but the Side Effects you have to endure to fix the Original Problem end up being even worse. This brings me to why I use MXE - Still after 5 years.
> 
> 
> 
> In my Personal Opinion - There is NO BETTER Medication on the Current USA Approved Medications List for Treating Depression, Bi-Polar, and Schizophrenia than Ketamine, Methoxetamine, or Dextromethorphan ( DXM ). DXM has also helped me out of MANY a deep depressive episode long before MXE was first Synthesized, and long before I had regular access to Ketamine. Dissociatives are an AMAZING tool to help those who are Mentally Ill - but the Physical Research, and Scientific Proof of this is JUST NOW starting to be recognized. These Compounds have been shrugged off and looked past for FAR too long. They could Genuinely be the Ticket to help stop the Suffering that is living EVERY DAY of your Life with a Debilitating Mental Disorder - or Multiple Disorders, and Research into these Compounds is finally starting to prove that they have Practical Applications in some people's Daily Lives. To me - Methoxetamine is the Anti-Depressant that I've needed all along, but that was never synthesized or deeply researched because of an Outdated Mindset. Does it cause me issues sometimes - Yes it does. Are they WORSE than what I was dealing with BEFORE I started taking MXE 5 Years Ago - NO. If I could go back and never try MXE, would I? NO. The Difference between a Poison and a Medicine sometimes can be needle thin, and depend on each individual person. A Medication that Cures one Person - can very easily Kill someone else. To me, This is where MXE stands right now. I view it more as something that should be Treated like a Genuine Medicine - not just some party drug. I don't NEED to take 100mgs a day to get ALL of the AMAZING Anti-Depressant, Mood Stabilizing, Go out and Live your Life to the Fullest Joyful Effects that MXE has to offer. Even after 5 years of ABUSE - 5-10mgs of MXE is enough to keep me living an Active Life, Enjoying My Life, Spending Time with my Family, Friends and Loved One's, taking part in all of the Varieties of Art that MAKE My Life WORTH living - and even the tiniest little few mgs of MXE changes ME from a grumpy, lay in bed all day, overly emotional, paranoid, lifetime of depression asshole - Into the Man that I WANT to Be and that I'm PROUD to be.

> Sure - I've paid my dues in learning the downsides of Daily MXE use / abuse over the Years I've spent with Methoxetamine in my Life.........But I wouldn't change a thing. This Drug has HELPED my Life, helped me discover who I TRULY am, taken me on Journeys thru the Human Imagination and Mind that you can't even PUT a Price on. Yes, I have had a few crazy days where I was borderline losing my mind from doing too much - but I learned from those experiences and adjusted my Usage accordingly. We as a COLLECTIVE on this Site are teaching each other, and helping each other understand what this drug should be used for, and what it shouldn't be used for - who should be using it, and who may want to pass on this one because they have preexisting conditions that we've found don't vibe all that well with this Compound. Big Pharma isn't interested in Finding a Cure for things like Depression and Bi-Polar Disorder, let alone heavier Mental Disorders like Schizophrenia.........Why would they want to " Cure " something that is one of their HUGEST Money Makers, and that you can manipulatively convince almost anyone that they could possibly have the Disorder. EVERYONE gets Depressed in Life - that doesn't mean all people HAVE Depression. 
> 
> 
> 
> I just REALLY feel like there is a pretty large chunk of people, especially in the USA who suffer from these debilitating mental disorders - and who don't have QUALITY treatment options to help their Disorders, and on top of that - telling people in your life that you have these disorders can be a very Taboo subject, and I've had friends stop associating with me just because I told them I was Bi-Polar and had dealt with Depression most of my life - It's a part of who of I am and always will be, but that doesn't mean I can't live a normal life just like anyone else. I've had people tell me they were scared of me after I told them I was Bi-Polar.  People, even people in this Thread, or on Bluelight in general may not TRULY Understand the full extent of how hard it is to live life in our judgmental society when you have to deal with a Mental Disorder on a daily basis. I find your average person seems to be so under informed or misinformed about these disorders - their general reaction tends to be fear of what they don't understand. 
> 
> 
> 
> I'm making these statements because they all go into why I personally use MXE, and will continue to use MXE until an equally effective, or better Drug for the issues that make my life extremely difficult to live is Synthesized - because as it stands right now, the medications available for treatment of the mental disorders I mentioned are a straight up JOKE. I've learned to deal with the downsides of MXE - I now know what they are and remain aware of them at all times - I try and use the amount of MXE that I need to feel like a Normal Person and accomplish what needs to be accomplished in my life, without being overly or obviously intoxicated or just " Weird " to the outside world as some people put it. When I compare MXE, to some of the SSRI's I've taken for 60-90 days trying to help my mental stability - to me - there isn't really much difference when it comes to risk versus reward. When I first started taking Lexapro - about 40-45 days into my treatment, I had a really weird day, I didn't feel like myself at all, I was having terrible anxiety, couldn't get it to go away - I tried to commit suicide that day and ended up in the hospital on Psychiatric Hold for 72 hours. That was a Legal Drug, made by Big Pharma, Legally Prescribed to me with the Intent of HELPING ME. Trusting that Doctor and just Blindly taking what he gave me without learning about what the Drug was doing to my Brain, My Body, My Mind etc..........Lexapro almost caused me to Kill Myself. I've been using MXE for 5 years and I haven't tried to, considered, or even had suicidal thoughts about killing myself - and that's the first time in my Entire LIFE I've gone 5 years without trying to Take My Life. I have DEEP Mental Issues, and MXE is all that helps..........From an outside Perspective, which Compound is a Medicine - and which Compound is a Poison? Just because something is LEGAL doesn't make it immediately helpful or GOOD - Just as much as something being Illegal, or in a Legal Grey Area doesn't always make something BAD. I may be Dead today if I kept letting myself be a Guinea Pig for Psychiatrist and Pharmaceutical Companies to try their latest concoction on. Instead, I took the matter into my own hands, did my own research using my knowledge of my own body and mind to try and find a better solution for my Problems - and to me, I did. MXE may not be the perfect fix for my issues - but it's a HELL of a lot better than the life I was living before.

> The Reality of Methoxetamine is this - KNOW YOURSELF, know how addictive of a personality you have, know what kinds of drugs you're the most prone to abuse, take the time to take a step back and ask yourself if the Benefits of the Drug your using outweigh the Negatives, take the time to Educate yourself as much as possible about your Drugs of Choice and all of the possible Dangers, Benefits, and everything in Between - So many people just come on here and say........." MXE is Causing me this Problem ", when there have been 50 other posts of Intelligent Bluelight Users who are saying the EXACT same thing as you, and possibly even 2,3, maybe even 4 or 5 years ago - If you choose to dive head first into a still really new compound, and you make the conscious decision to not Educate Yourself about the possible Consequences, whether Physical or Mental of your Decisions..........At some point THE USER needs to take some RESPONSIBILITY for not using all of the Variety of resources that their are on BL and other similar websites about these new and novel Compounds that we're all kind of learning about and getting to Understand Together. Somewhere along the line - People need to accept that THEY made the choice to Use the Drug, and they have no one to blame but themselves. If you know that when you take MXE - all of these negative things start happening in your life, and you still choose to use it - then an Addiction, or at least a Mental or Mild Physical dependence has been formed. YOU, as the User - have to keep track of these things. YOU need to realize that you are personally accountable for the consequences that you're facing. A drug that may Save My Life - May Kill You..........That's the reality of Life. If you're unwilling to accept that as a Drug User - You should quit using them while you're still alive.

> MXE didn't MAKE YOU do this or that - It just brought out a part of YOUR Personality, that was there ALL ALONG, that maybe you just never realized was a part of you. I really don't like when people blame drugs for their personal issues. To me, especially in the case of Psychedelics or Dissociatives which tend to have a more " Search for Enlightenment " or " Getting to really know Yourself " vibe - they put you in touch with every aspect of your personality, and I feel like they make you a Complete Person while you're on them. When I'm on Psychedelics or Dissociatives - I feel like I'm a better Human Being, I care more about the things that I SHOULD care about, I think about those around me always instead of just myself and my needs. When I'm on MXE especially, or really any Psychedelic Compound - I feel like the REAL version of Myself, the Best version of Myself. That's why when it comes to MXE - People just need to realize and come to the conclusion for themselves, by being in touch with who they are and how different drugs effect them - So they can make an Educated Decision about whether or not MXE is right for Me. It's DEFINITELY NOT A DRUG FOR EVERYONE. It takes a pretty unique individual to be able to handle the effects of an M-Hole - and it takes a certain kind of Brain / Mind to enjoy / receive the Beneficial Side of MXE. You have to Know Yourself well enough to decide whether this Drug is for You. 
> 
> 
> 
> If you don't know yourself that well - then maybe you shouldn't try MXE right now. Maybe you should wait until you're a little more in tune with who you are and what you're about, as well as knowing more about your Genetics, as well as Mental Health History. If you don't know these things, you are taking a pretty big jump into the deep end of the pool so to speak. I consider MXE to be a Compound for the more Experienced Psychonaut - Up there with DMT and LSD in the Lessons it can Teach You or help you help Yourself with, It's not for your once a year LSD eater, or your go out to the Club and do some MDMA User - MXE is for those who are suffering from Treatment Resistant Depression, Bi-Polar Disorder, Schizophrenia, and it can also be helpful in small doses with Social Anxiety, as well as Pain Management for those who don't want to use Opiates / Opioids, or who can't use other Stronger Pain Medications. This Compound works well in even 5-15mg daily doses for all of the above disorders that I mentioned - as I personally have been diagnosed with all of them unfortunately, but it does make me a decent resource for what this drug is really all about. If you just want to Party on it and have fun - Don't EVER use it for more than a 1-3 Day MAXIMUM period at a time, and then take a 1-2 week break after a Weekend Bender. This will help you keep your Tolerance down so you keep your ability to Access the Magic that MXE has to Offer, while not doing TOO MUCH to where you're creating an Addictive Cycle.
>

> Last Statement - To those posters who have said things like " When I don't have MXE, I'm super depressed and just wait until I have more to go back to living my Life". How do you know that you didn't have Severe Depression before you ever tried MXE, you've actually secretly been suffering from Depression for your entire Life - but you never even REALIZED it, because you didn't know what it felt like to NOT be Depressed?? Now that you're Depression has finally been lifted, and you've had a taste of what living a Normal, Depression Free Life is Like - who's to say that's not the reason that you feel down when you don't have MXE? If you've had a history of Depression, or Manic Depressive Behavior - this could very well be the case. The 1st time I took MXE reminded me of the 1st time I took DXM, only it was WAY Cleaner - It made me feel like MYSELF. It made me feel like the Man I TRULY am, not the half of a human I feel like when I'm Depressed, or dealing with an Episode. The 1st time I took MXE - It reminded me of what it TRULY MEANS to be ALIVE! MXE can be an AMAZING TOOL, but just like a Scalpel in the Hands of a Skilled Surgeon - versus a Scalpel in Hands of a Butcher..............The Person Using the Tool, matters JUST AS MUCH as the Tool itself. If you don't know yourself, and aren't 100% honest with yourself about your Personality, and Tendency for Addiction - You should just leave this Compound ALONE so you don't RUIN IT for the rest of us who Genuinely NEED it because we've ran out of other options. The facts remain tho, to Me, as of this Date and Time - there just is not a better Anti-Depressant / Mood Stabilizing Drug available, not from a Doctor, not from a Psychiatrist, not from a Drug Dealer. If you don't suffer from any of these issues - you should probably just leave this Drug alone, because there's a Good Chance in my Opinion that if MXE is helping these kinds of Issues in People who already had them - there's a good chance that if you DON'T have any of these issues, it could very well cause them in a Mentally Healthy Individual. Think Before You use this Drug even ONCE. To the right person - It is VERY Addictive, and hard to put down.

> I've gotten to where I don't NEED to use it Daily - But I do feel the NEED to be in Possession of at least 500mgs of MXE at all times in my Stash. I may not use it all for a whole week or sometimes 2 even - but just KNOWING that it's there for me when I start to feel down, or start to feel an episode coming on - Just KNOWING that I now have the Tool in my Possession to fix the Problems that I've dealt with my whole life when they decide to show up - That Knowing in itself gives me power over my Issues. I don't even always need to physically take MXE - but the Peace of Mind that it gives me having enough on hand to fix a bad Manic / Depressive Cycle..............That's an Amazing thing to Me - and something that NO DOCTOR has EVER been able to give me. Safe Travels to my Psychonauts - and I Wish Better Mental Health and Happier Days Ahead to all of my Fellow Already Mentally Fucked in the Head MXE / Dissociative Users. Stay Well my Friends and fellow Researchers. I wish you all the best - Mr. Meowfish

> 			There is a *grain* of truth in this type of thinking. Psychedelics and dissociatives (and maybe all intoxicants) can sometimes give one a chance to see that something may have been missing in their ordinary sober minds. In this way, they can offer a glance at all that has become habitual and therefore invisible in our lives. These invisible habits of mind can be a sort of sober "depression" or torpor or complacency; they can be many other things as well.

> I have had random UTI's from doing too much MXE over the course of 2-3 Days, and a lot of that Issue comes from just Forgetting to Drink Extra Water or Liquids like you would when you're on MDMA - but I'm also prescribed Subutex ( Buprenorphine ) a HEAVY Opioid which it Itself ALSO cause TERRIBLE Water Retention, makes it SUPER hard to Piss, and causes severe Constipation. I would Imagine that the UTI's are a Combination of taking my Daily Subutex which I've been on for 5 years, as well as taking MXE 3-7 Days a Week. The biggest Downside for me is when I run out of MXE - I still get an Afterglow that lasts about 2-3 days minimum, and if I smoke Weed after I run out, I don't even Notice any kind of Withdrawal Syndrome or Depression or anything like that - but I also have 10mg Diazepam on hand at all times and 1mg Alprazolam, so all of those things could make a difference as well concerning my Mental Health and Well Being when I run out - which is quite rare. I do go on 6-8 Month IV Benders sometimes..............This Drug is by NO Means SAFE to use Daily, I'm just passing on my 1st hand Accounts of Using MXE Daily - so if people find themselves in that Position, they have some Options on ways to help themselves out of it. The main " Addictive Nature " of MXE is Purely Psychological - It's fun as fucking fuck and makes everything in Life WAY more fun, easier to deal with, and just Brighter in Every Way. I never experienced what I would TRULY CALL ACTUAL Happiness before I started taking MXE - that's how DEEP my Depression has been for 31 Years. Take my Information and Read It - Or just Skip my Posts altogether. I'm only here to Help Pass On Information about an AMAZING Compound and trying to tell these Youngsters who are Hurting Themselves by Overdoing it, to SLOW DOWN and Pace Yourself...............That's not too bad of Info in my Book.......

> #1 - I'm not insecure about anything regarding any of my drug use in any way shape or form. I am EXTREMELY honest with all of my close friends, and openly talk about IV Injection of Methoxetamine 3-5 Times a Week if not more. I Hide NOTHING from anyone that I care about or on this Message Board. To Me, Lying Accomplishes Nothing but Spreading FALSE INFORMATION, which is the Opposite of the Purpose of BL. FUCK THAT. I don't lie to Myself about my Drug Use - I know how Detrimental it Could be, Can Be, and Has Been at different times in my life - but just like I said in my Post, Just like any Drug or Medicine - It comes down to whether or not the Benefits Outweigh the Consequences of what you're choosing to do with Your Life and Your Body.
> 
> 
> 
> I was Simply offering a Different Perspective about the MXE Lifestyle, and just trying to give back to the Community an Outside of the Box thought. Most of my Post was SPECIFICALLY SAYING that this Drug, MXE, Is something that should be Considered VERY Special, and above all else - IT'S NOT A DRUG FOR JUST ANYONE. MXE to me is a Medicine. To other people who use it - it completely fucks op their whole Universe. The Point I was making was that, before someone even CONSIDERS TRYING MXE - They need to know WHO they are, what Drugs they Enjoy and their Personality Type when it comes to Intoxicating Substances, and if they choose to STILL mess around with MXE - They're basically Playing With Fire. This Drug is for people who are suffering from Treatment Resistant Depression, All Varieties of Bi-Polar and Schizophrenic Disorders, Different types of Social Anxiety and Panic Attack Disorders.................If you don't have at least one of these Conditions that you are FORCED to deal with on a daily basis - to me, you have NO PLACE taking MXE more than 1-2 Times a Month, and STRICTLY for Fun.
> 
> 
> 
> You COMPLETELY missed the point of my Posting. It's common knowledge that generally, the condition that a Drug Treats - when the Drug is Discontinued - the Original Symptoms come back WAY WORSE and more Intense than Before. If you DON'T have any of the Above Listed Disorders - To me, as a 5 Year, 200+ Gram Veteran of this Compound, I've got some experience and knowledge about what MXE is actually useful for treating - and that there are just straight up, some people who do to the predisposed conditions that they May or May Not Have, SHOULD NOT TRY THIS DRUG because it can make your Small Issue into a VERY Large one. I was TRYING to tell people who DON'T SUFFER from Depression, or Bi-Polar, or Mental Health Diseases of this Type Should basically AVOID THIS DRUG ALMOST ALL TOGETHER. 
> 
> 
> 
> It's a VERY POWERFUL Compound - and some people just don't have the Knowledge, or Self Control to use it Properly WITHOUT HURTING THEMSELVES. There are a Handful of cats in the MXE thread that have been going HARD for the past 5 years straight, putting in Personal Time and Effort to Document the Positive and Negative Effects of this Drug - and I'm one of those People. You can Speculate all that you want about what a Drug does Long Term, or Who Should Take It and Who Shouldn't - but you're most Informed Subjects are going to be the ones with EXTENSIVE First Hand Experience. All I was trying to say in My Post - was that this Drug is a PERFECT fit for certain people who deal with certain Life Debilitating Issues - Whereas there are PLENTY of people who this Drug is ONLY going to Harm Them and CAUSE Them Issues in their Life.

> I want Methoxetamine to One Day be a RESPECTED Compound in the Medical Community - something that can save those suffering from Suicidal Tendencies in a VERY QUICK way. MXE has Saved me from Killing Myself SO MANY TIMES it's RIDICULOUS. I've attempted Suicide 5-6 Different Times, and in a Different Way EVERYTIME. Since I TOUCHED MXE - I've had the first 5 years of my Life where I didn't feel like I deserved to Die, I felt Self Respect and Self Esteem on a DAILY BASIS for the FIRST TIME EVER IN MY LIFE, outside of DXM Binges - and the first 1-2 Weeks of Using heavy Opiates - Which MXE has helped me learn to despise, because Opiates to a LARGE extent have become an outdated medicine. There are FAR better ways, like Dissociatives, to help kill pain - or at least separate yourself from it like how Marijuana helps people with ALL different varieties of Nerve Pain, Physical Pain, ETC.
> 
> 
> 
> My Main Point was this - This Compound - 3-MeO-2-Oxo-PCE is AMAZING, and needs to be Treated by ALL PEOPLE WHO COME INTO CONTACT WITH IT MORE RESPONSIBLY. Taking LSD every day is NOT good for your Mental Health. Neither is taking MXE every single day - BUT, when used in Moderation, and BY THOSE WHO ACTUALLY NEED IT - and can work WONDERS! I was just trying to say that if you're only taking 25-50mgs or even 100mgs a few times a week - and if You're having THOSE SERIOUS OF ISSUES, like BECOMING Bi-Polar, or Terrible Depression, or Waiting to go and find a Job while you wait on your MXE - Those are Issues Created BY THE PERSON CHOOSING TO TAKE THE DRUG, NOT Issues caused by the Drug Itself. If you're not in touch with YOUR Personal Brain Chemistry, and you don't know what a particular Drug is going to do to you, for Better or for Worse, YOU need to be the one to take Self Responsibility and ADMIT to YOURSELF that you need to put this Drug DOWN. If you're not willing to do that - to some extent, you deserve to learn the Lessons you're being taught by Suffering Through the Negative Consequences.

> The Information is here is this Thread - ANYTHING you could every WANT TO OR NEED TO KNOW about Methoxetamine. It's not my fault if these youngsters get a hold of this POWERFUL, LIFE CHANGING, Dissociative / Psychedelic and they go and fuck themselves up with it. It's their OWN FAULT for NOT Educating themselves better before they dive in to a Still Fairly New Compound that we learn more about every day, By SHARING our personal experiences with each other Everyday. I have no Pity for those who CHOOSE to not Educate themselves about a Drug - and then have either Addiction Issues, or Mental Problems from Abusing it too much. Whatever happened to SELF RESPONSIBILITY???
> 
> 
> 
> That's all I have to say. People using MXE, whether they've done it Once, or 1,000 Times - Take some PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY for YOUR ACTIONS. No one is Forcing the Drug down your throat. Don't blame MXE because it brought out the Asshole in You, that was always there, just waiting for the right Compound or Situation in life to bring it out of You. Drugs ( Other Than Opiates ) show the REAL You by lower walls of Inhibition. It's not my fault or the Drugs fault if you can't handle your Shit - or you CHOOSE to not educate yourself about what you're taking. Whatever happened to PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY?? It seems to not exist anymore. People just play the Blame Game CONSTANTLY so they don't have to face the REAL REALITY of the Life THEY'RE CHOOSING TO LIVE.

There's not much Scientific Information at the Moment - So all we can do is HELP EACH OTHER UNDERSTAND THE RISKS. I was trying to Help. You just want to disregard a Post that I spent over an Hour Reading, and Re-Reading to make sure it said PRECISELY what I wanted it to. My intentions are not Ill in any way. To Me - If you use MXE, whether I think you should be or not - that's none of my business - BUT I'm STILL HERE TO SUPPORT YOU and pass on ANY and ALL Information that I've PERSONALLY Taken the Time to DOCUMENT by writing while I'm on MXE, at all varieties of Depths of the Compound.

Once you've spent Weeks, and Months on end - Injecting IV 50-100mgs of MXE anywhere from 3-5 times a week, to just on the Weekend, to Every Single Day for MONTHS on End sometimes - You tend to feel like you have a Little Bit more to Say, and a Slightly more Knowledgeable Opinion, although it is still just an Opinion, on the Subject of MXE. There are not many people who have put as much Time and Dedication into Documenting the Full Spectrum of what this Drug is TRULY capable of Accomplishing. If you want to disregard the Friendly Advice of Someone who knows what the fuck they're talking about - go ahead, it's your Body, Mind, and Soul - But I'm doing nothing but Offering Information that is Straightforward, Easy to Understand, and COMPLETELY HONEST.

I just think that A LOT of BL Posters and People in General take MXE WAY TOO LIGHTLY, like it's some casual drug. MXE is EVERY BIT as Deep Philosophically, Introspectively, and Psychedelically TO ME as LSD, Mushrooms, DMT - I feel it's just as Powerful of a Teacher as ANY of the Most Respected and Most POWERFUL Psychedelics / Dissociatives / Tryptamines / Phenethylamines that are on the Market right now, or that have ever been synthesized.
> 
> 
> 
> Maybe I feel this way Simply because Methoxetamine has Helped ME Personally SO MUCH - but I share the Information that I share, even to the ridiculous extent sometimes of how much I may use in 24 Hours. All I can say is I spent from 22-23 all the way through to 26-27 as either a Daily Heroin Addict - or from 26-27 as an Opiate Addict trying to Stabilize his Life by getting on Buprenorphine Treatment, while still chipping and using Heroin during the 1st 2 Years of my Treatment. Those 1st 2 Years of Buprenorphine Treatment were ALSO the First 2 Years that I found and started Using regularly MXE. When I started using MXE - It made using Heroin seem SO DISGUSTING to me, just PURE HEDONISM, no Insights, no Intellect or Intelligence needed - Just pure pleasure, nothing more. MXE, being a Dissociative, can have quite similar PHYSICAL Euphoria and Enjoyment compared to a Heavy Opiate / Opioid - but without the OVERNIGHT Physically Addictive Nature - PLUS Dissociatives have SO SO SO MUCH MORE DEPTH to them than Opiates. Opiates are such a Self Serving, Selfish, Don't Care about Anything but Getting Your Fix kind of Drug - Where I found MXE to be the COMPLETE Opposite. I initially started taking it to Combat the Fatigue and Depression caused by Opiate Dependence, to have a FUN Drug to do other than Opiates - and just in General, I felt like MXE REALLY REALLY Balanced out the Negative Effects of the Subutex I've been on for 5 Years now. MXE Counteracts that Selfish Nature, it makes you see the Bigger Picture of Life - that you ARE NOT the Center of the Universe, not even YOUR Universe. I found it to be a VERY Humbling, Enlightening Experience - and at no point, even after the amount of time that I've Used MXE - It still surprises me at Times with the different Perspectives it shows me that I never would have thought of on my own, It STILL has Lessons to Teach Me in SO many different Aspects of Life.

> I will Continue to Use MXE as much as I like to, or enjoy to - Until I feel that it no Longer serves a Purpose in my Life, or Until I feel like I'm no Longer gaining any Knowledge or Insights about Myself, Life, or the World Around Me from It. Sometimes I feel like the Day that I Quit Using MXE - Will be the day that I finally find the Inner Strength to beat my Subutex Dependence - and I call it that instead of Addiction because I FUCKING HATE SUBUTEX / SUBOXONE / BUPRENORPHINE - Any version of that Opioid I FUCKING HATE. It feels NASTY and like somethings not right about it, the Doctors who Prescribe it are nothing but Pill Mill Pill Pushers.............But that's another Topic. I MAINLY Use my MXE to COMBAT all of the Different Ways that Subutex makes me Feel Like Shit and want to Kill Myself. REAL TALK.
> 
> 
> 
> Back to the Question I was trying to Answer - Do I feel it takes a Certain Level of Insight to Properly Use MXE? I guess in a way, it kind of does. If you had NEVER touched a Psychedelic or Dissociative before, and someone offered you 5 hits of 100ug Doses - or a 50mg Hit of DMT out of an Oil Burner for your VERY FIRST Psychedelic Experience, for probably 75-90% of your Average Drug Users - That could Potentially ROCK THE FUCK out of their Personal Universe -ESPECIALLY nowadays with Weed being WAY more Accessible and WAY LESS Judged and Looked Down On, I feel like it creates a breed of people who think that because they can smoke 3.5 Grams of High Grade Medicinal Bud in a Day, that somehow makes them a Psychedelic Warrior or some Shit and now they can all of a Sudden Handle Any Drug put in front of Them. That's just not the Case. Potent, Especially Psychedelics or Dissociatives that are reasonably to extremely Potent at less than 10mgs - an Inexperienced Tripper, with an Under Informed Trip Sitter as Well could REALLY REALLY find themselves in some FUCKED UP SITUATIONS with some of these New, Super Potent Psychedelic and Dissociative RC's that are Available to People that say 7-10 years ago, these same People would NOT HAVE HAD ACCESS to such Potent Psychedelic and Dissociative Compounds if it wasn't for the Internet.

> The Internet is AMAZING - but it also makes a LOT of Compounds that MAYBE shouldn't be available yet to up and coming Psychonauts who are still JUST getting to Know WHO THEY ARE, What they're about, What Drugs They Like, What Mental Health Issues they may have in their Family Background. There are just SO MANY DIFFERENT, but EQUALLY IMPORTANT Issues that come into Play when you talk about a Topic like this. I Personally WOULD like it if EVERYONE who enjoys the Psychedelic or Dissociative Mind State to give MXE a Try at LEAST ONCE in their Lifetime - What I'm saying is MXE is SO Powerful of a Tool, that in the wrong hands, it could very easily do some damage to someones fragile Psyche - ESPECIALLY Someone who REALLY Relies on their Ego for A LOT in their Life. Having that Suddenly Taken Away could really Freak an Under Experienced Tripper the FUCK OUT and possibly turn them off to MXE, Ketamine, DXM, PCP - It could turn them off to an AMAZING Class of Drugs, that tends to be Misunderstood Anyways, and it Could make that Person NEVER WILLING to give a Dissociative a Try Again because they had that ONE Bad Experience. I have friends that are EXACTLY LIKE THIS because the 1st time they did Ketamine, the Accidently did too much, went into a DEEP K-Hole, Scared the FUCK out of themselves - and now they look at Ketamine as EVIL.

> 
> 
> I just feel MXE is SO POTENT when it's a Top Shelf Synthesis, it can be very Confusing and hard to Navigate if you aren't used to it. I just feel like people should experiment with Tripping In General before they dive into the Deep End. MXE can take you to Places in your Mind, or Visually that are just as Crazy and Bizarre as LSD, Mushrooms, or DMT - and that's saying A LOT. Those are what most people who like to Trip Consider the Ultimate 3 Compounds that EVERY Tripper should Try at least ONCE in their life. I think MXE and Ketamine should be JUST as Important, and Viewed as on the Same Level as being a Teacher and a Life Changing Experience as the previous Compounds I just listed.

All of these SUPER POTENT, Powerful, Mind Altering Compounds can be for the Good and Help Us Realize things about the World Around Us and Ourselves that is very Important Information to Know - Or depending on Your Personal Brain Chemistry, ANY AND ALL of these POTENT COMPOUNDS could just as Easily COMPLETELY FUCK YOUR LIFE UP instead of Helping it.

The Main Intent of my Above post was just that if you want to Explore the World of Dissociatives and Psychedelics - You may want to start somewhere else, because MXE can be WAY TOO MUCH for a Novice Psychonaut. Take a few trips on some LSD, or some AL-LAD first - or eat 1-1.5 Grams of Mushrooms, you have to get a FEELING for what the Psychedelic Experience is About, and all of the Crazy Places it can take your Mind BEFORE you jump head first into one of the most Powerful Experiences I've ever had in my life - Methoxetamine..............and I've downed many a 10 Strip of LSD, maxing out at 15 Doses at one time - and I've eaten 7 Grams of Top Shelf Mushrooms on Multiple Occasions.

> ALWAYS KEEP SOME ETIZOLAM, XANEX, VALIUM, Or SOME KIND OF BENZODIAZEPINE AROUND IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE TRIPPING, ESPECIALLY IF YOU LIKE TO TRIP MORE THAN 2-3 Times a Week. SAFETY FIRST. Those Benzo's can turn a Bad Trip into a Magic Trip in a SECOND. I won't even Trip anymore unless I have a Pocketful of Benzo's to either chill out the trip if it gets too intense, or to help me sleep when coming down. There is FOR SURE a Method to Tripping and ALWAYS having a FUN TIME - and that Method takes time to Learn. Once you know how to Trip Safely - Check out some MXE, it's fucking AMAZING - but at the same time remember, Dissociatives don't always Agree with Everyone's Brain Chemistry, or State of Mind at any Given Time. I feel like Disco's are a more Acquired Taste than Traditional Psychedelics. You kind of have to Learn to Like them. They do have MASSIVE Knowledge and Insight to Offer - and they are GREAT if you're an Artist. Some of the best Art I've ever created was on DXM, Ketamine, or MXE. It all really just comes down to what you Personal Preference of Intoxication is. I personally HATE MDMA - But I'd bet a good 90% of people on BL fucking LOVE MDMA or MDA - To me, they just feel like COMPLETELY FAKE EMOTIONS - Whereas, a Drug like Ketamine or MXE has a very Similar "Feel" in a way to me as MDMA or MDA - but the Happiness and Joy that I get from Dissociatives just feel so much more REAL. That Happy Feeling you get from MDMA just feels FAKE AS FUCK to me, and as soon as the Drug wears off - I'm a GRUMPY FUCK who just wants to leave the party. I can make 40-50mgs of MXE last ALL NIGHT, FEEL CONTENT the WHOLE TIME, AND wake up in an AWESOME MOOD the next day. Maybe it's all just Brain Chemistry - Who Knows?? It's all Speculation until someone with the Funds, Equipment, and Time steps up to the Plate and decides to Scientifically Figure Out EXACTLY what Methoxetamine is all About. Until then - All we have is OUR Community ; ) - Meowfish

Heroin was easy to get off of Compared to Subutex. It takes a FULL 3 MONTH DETOX, with a FULL 30-45 DAYS OF FUCKING AWFUL, CONSTANT WITHDRAWALS. I think Subutex and Suboxone - While they do help a lot of People get their Opiate / Opioid Addiction UNDER CONTROL - We, as a Society, choose to accept that just "Being On Subutex, or in Opiate Treatment" if COMPLETELY DEFEATING the Problem. To me - That's nothing more than Big Pharma Propaganda that they tell you so you stay Addicted to THEIR Medication instead of going out and Buying Street Drugs you may actually Enjoy.


If I could go back - I WOULD NEVER HAVE STARTED TAKING SUBUTEX!!!! The Doctors are SO Corrupt - My Meds are Covered by Insurance Luckily - but before they were, I was Paying between $600-800 a Month on my Prescription, and then another $250.00 - Cash or Credit ONLY - Just to get my Appointment with my Doctor. Where I live, NOT ONE BUPRENORPHINE DOCTOR has an ACTUAL TAPERING PLAN FOR GETTING YOU OFF THE DRUGS!!! They want you to stay addicted, and keep bringing them Money. To me, Subutex is nothing more than PUNISHMENT for being a bad kid and trying Heroin or Heavy Pain Pills. I get JACK SHIT from Subutex - Never have, Never Will, but I'm JUST AS STRUNG OUT WHEN I DON'T TAKE IT AS IF I WAS STILL SHOOTING HEROIN!! I quit SHOOTING HEROIN 4 different times, Cold Turkey, during my main 3.5-4 year run where I was Shooting 1-1.5 Grams of Black Tar Heroin Daily, and taking Xanex and smoking massive Weed with it as well. 


If I had the Choice - I would rather Kick HEROIN than Buprenorphine ( Subutex / Suboxone ) ANY DAY. I fucking HATE the way that Subutex feels - Buprenorphine just feels like a fucking DIRTY OPIATE to me, Suboxone with the Naltrexone Added is even MORE DISGUSTING. To answer your question directly - why has MXE not helped me quit Subutex, but I claim that it helped me kick Heroin for good???


The #1 Reason and the ONLY Reason - I don't have fucking 2-3 Months to just lay in bed, barely able to move, shitting my pants, throwing up, grumpy as fuck, prone to Violence, having Suicidal Thoughts DAILY..............I don't have time for all of that. If I do that - I lose my Job - Ill Lose EVERYTHING I've worked so hard for - to have a STABLE LIFE ENVIRONMENT, A Life I don't want to wake up and put a Gun in my Mouth every morning to see if Today is the Day I can't take this Piece of SHIT World and Society we all live in. Simply put - I don't have the time to go thru the SUPER LONG LASTING, PAINFUL AS FUCK Withdrawals of Subutex. If I could NOT BE SICK TOMORROW - If I threw away my bottle of Subutex TONIGHT and Promised to Never TOUCH another Opiate again - I'd make that trade in a fucking SECOND. I HATE the Sub Doctors, they're GREEDY CROOKS, I had the Medication. I'd give anything to get off this nasty SHIT and be able to fall in Love with another Beautiful, Sweet, Kindhearted Woman Again and GLADLY would have that be my Companionship and Dopamine Fix - but in this BULLSHIT RAT RACE that we're ALL Subjected to on a Daily Basis, it's just one big Catch 22.


I've tried at least 10 Different Taper Plans - They just don't work for me. Below 2mgs of Buprenorphine and you're still sick, all day, every day, until it FINALLY leaves your body. I've straight up MADE IT 30+ days Clean - and I was STILL SO SICK I COULD BARELY WALK!!! Let alone go to work at a Physical Labor Job like I work as a Skilled Tradesman. When it comes to Subutex - I think the last day I'll be taking it, it probably going to be the day I die....................but fuck it - I don't want to live past 50, and I'm already 31, so bring on the Casket. In some ways - I think that Death may actually be the Ultimate Trip. Who Knows how long those last few Seconds of your Brain Being Alive after your body is Dead could FEEL LIKE IN TERMS OF ACTUAL TIME......You would be residing in a Place where Time no Longer Existed whatsoever, combined with the MASSIVE DMT RELEASE that your body gives you when you're about to Pass Away, onto whatever is next in this bizarre Matrix of a Planet and Universe we're a Part Of. 


I've seen every side of life, I've been Rich, I've been Homeless - and anything and everything in between. I've tried damn near every Drug on the Planet - the Ones that CAN BE Injected IV - I've shot up, the others that couldn't be Injected, I smoked, like PCP. To me, I've already Died in the Hospital from a Heroin OD and they brought me back to Life - I've tried to take my Life during Manic Depressive Episodes................MXE has saved me from this constant state of completely unafraid mania, where it's almost like half of me WANTS to Die, just to see what it's like - Whereas since I started using MXE 5 Years ago, I see the Beauty and the Wonderful things in My Life, instead of Focusing on the Negative Only. MXE has helped me learn to be Patient, that all things come in their due time - and to be honest, I spent a good chunk of my Life, due to Family Drama, and just the Bullshit that can be Life Sometimes, especially when you fall in Love - There have been many times I've begged for Death, because I couldn't handle Seeing and Being around the Suffering that is Our Current Planet Earth. MXE help me see the Brighter Side of Things. Even if MXE ends up BEING what Kills me in the End - I'd STILL trade the 5 Amazing Years of Depression Free Happiness - For the other 26 YEARS that I live MISERABLE AS FUCK, NOT EVEN KNOWING WHO I REALLY WAS, LETTING PEOPLE ROB AND TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ME WITHOUT EVEN REALIZING IT BECAUSE OF HOW NAIVE I WAS.

You are entitled to do to yourself whatever you want, but when me and my ex-roommate / best friend tried 3-MeO-PCP and MXE as anti-depressants we found the price to pay too steep. I myself could eventually never moderate my MXE use but was okay with 3-MeO-PCP since my appreciation of the risks of overdoing it, sometimes even just a little (as demonstrated by too many BLers incl veterans), that awareness is strong enough to keep me in check. Whereas that roommate eventually overdid it with the 3-MeO-PCP after having had sort of success with moderately dosed MXE.. He then immediately bailed on the dissociatives for depression, though not sure how much he dabbled later on.


So just saying or repeating after you even?.. that relief from depression is a blessing I bet (I don't have depression, but I thought I needed the pickmeup for motivational and other reasons at the time), but it is clear that there is a hell of a price to pay, especially and most of all for the addictively tempered ones..


Please be careful, do not lose touch with reality and watch out for mania!! Seriously.. but yeah I definitely see why are you are as a principle okay to pay the price to get the reward.. Just try to moderate to actually have a positive balance of pros and cons.

I found, that when it comes to people using and abusing you and then throwing you away - You can either choose to have a Pity Party for yourself and sit around and go back and forth from being Sad, Angry, and Bitter - To Realizing the reality of the Situation by looking at it from an outside perspective.................Sure, I got taken advantage of, I lost Money, I lost other things that I cared about - but at the End of the Day, Money is nothing more than a means to an end, a method thru which we are able to keep living and surviving. As for the People who did those things to me - Being Naive isn't always a bad thing, having a little bit of Innocence left inside of you when you're in your early 20's to me is actually a pretty wonderful thing. Sure, those first Lessons are hard as fuck to handle and learn from without being bitter or apathetic, and they definitely hurt like hell, but at the end of the day, they teach you to be more intelligent in the future, they teach you how to read people better, how to catch on to non verbal ques that EASILY show a lot of the time if a person is bullshitting and trying to be shady to you, or what the deal is.


Every Lesson in life learned, whether good or bad - can be used to learn in a productive way, or you can just be bitter and pissed off about things. Why let OTHER SHITTY PEOPLE ruin YOUR FUN, and let THEIR SHITTINESS turn you into a lesser Human Being. There are shitty people all around in life - even in the Psychedelic Scenes - You just have to learn how to ALWAYS DO YOU, while still respectfully and compassionately looking out for your fellow Humans. Over time - You get to the point where you can just look at how someone CARRIES THEMSELVES in a certain way, and it just becomes obvious that some people are just sketchy fucks who ruin awesome Scenes. It's just how it goes. Everyone's not ALWAYS going to get along, it's just life. You just have to finely tune your radar to weed out the shitty people. At least that's what I did.....

Wow, those last couple pages made me realize I don't have it so bad. Mr. Meowfish, I do believe you have a lot to offer but I will not listen when you come across with such a braggadocious, condescending, and hypocritical tone.


What's funny is I actually agree with a lot of what your saying, your not the first person to go off the deep end with dissos. I'm sorry I wasn't doing MXE 5 years ago as I was still stuck on DXM. So tell me, did MXE from 5 years ago give more insightful experiences than that of today?


And then of all places to say people aren't in touch with themselves enough. If BL posters aren't in touch with themselves,  then I don't know who is.

Is there a perma-tolerance to this drug? I've been using it very sparingly in recent months, and recently it has not been putting me in the pleasurable holes I once knew and loved... or is it more likely that one needs to be using weekly/bi weekly at the very least to get to the hole? I remember when I used to use more often, the experiences were better, and as my use has tapered, the experiences have become increasingly uninteresting, with 30 minute peaks max.


I have a further question on batch variance; I recently acquired some of the white Chinese sand MXE that was supposedly tested as pure MXE, and yet I've found that at 50mg, I was unable to reach a sufficiently pleasurable hole, teetering on the edge but not falling in. Yet the batch I had before it (from an old Spanish vendor) still *semi-reliably* gets me to a more far out space at 50mg. What's going on here? Why can't I reach the hole? Both batches *feel *like MXE, but to be honest I can't figure out why I'm losing the hole and not getting where I wana go with what used to be a reliable dose for a night of unspeakable pleasure.


Any thoughts?

I think there are a few types of tolerance with MXE, and dissos in general.


It seems each time I take a dissociative,  I am tacking on a bit more to my long-term, never to dissipate, true baseline tolerance. 


It also seems there are two types of short-term tolerance with MXE. 


The first applies to more intermittent use. It can take a week or two for your tolerance to completely return to baseline after your last previous use and once there, your single next dose should be about as potent as a similar amount was previously.


The other type is almost an inverse short-term tolerance. Where repeated dosing over multiple days (usually 2 to 3) leads to a more profound and fuller spectrum of effects.


This is just what I've noticed personally,  but it seems pretty consistent with what I've read and experienced with other dissos as well.

Well, I know that with nitrous, I can get a consistent and predictable effect, even after my year of disso use/abuse. I always get to the 'wahwahwahwah' space... however, with MXE, I've just been getting to a short hole, or no hole at all, and it's getting frustrating. I really want to reach the old holes I used to get.

N2O does like nothing for me anymore unless I combine it with weed or a psych. MXE I have noticed lately the hole has taken more material to reach and I can't recall much at all. It's still there for me though, and I think with more strategic dosing and longer breaks of sobriety it will get back to where it was. Do you smoke weed with it often?

I used to combine it with weed often, and when I did, it would certainly bring me to a more intense place; however, not as desirable of a place. Recently I haven't had access to weed and so have ceased combining the two. My sobriety breaks are rather lengthy and often in regards to MXE now, and I never used it daily, which is why I'm confused as to why it won't work for me recently.

I'd say MXE tolerance in some ways could be long term or permanent. I certainly wouldn't get the same visuals I used to get from it back in the day. Assuming it was the same Chem which energy control and ecstasy data confirm. The original MXE was white larger almost like Indian K small blocks. That being said I still feel MXE strong at 50 mg but back in the day I would feel like I'm in a hamster wheel with bolder visuals if hthat makes sense lol

Hi guys!


Please check out our new social tripping / high talk thread, and the changed guidelines. It will only take a minute and will show you that there is a new place for the freely flowing talk that is not on-topic enough for these compound-focused threads.

I want to reply to a lot of the posts already in this new thread. I especially want to resonate with a lot of what Meowfish has been saying, him and I have more than a couple similarities in our path, most notably how we kicked a hard addiction to opiates when we started using MXE, yet we still both need to take a couple mg of buprenorphine every day. Any less and like he said it just leads to worse functioning. I don't like it either, but it is better than the alternatives. MXE does seem to help counteract the negative effects of opioid maintenance therapy, as a tool to help us reach a higher state in ourselves, activate the imagination, tune the brainwaves and such.


The other note I want to reply to is that yes, the batch variance in MXE is ridiculous. There is more to it than a standard analysis can tell us because analytically pure MXE has been seen in a number of different forms. Some are truly transcendent in their potential when activated properly, holes can reach the same kind of brain activity as lucid dreaming in my experience. Easy on the body too with a nice afterglow, while other forms can work to reach a higher or at least desirably altered state but may not 'hole' the same and may come with less desirable side effects.

not sure how widespread this information is, but i just heard from a reliable source that MXE was made illegal in China awhile back.  explains the current drought.

I think im giving up on recreational MXE use. Yesterday I went through 350+ mg and the only time the world really started moving was when I hit 3 whippits in a row about 10 minutes after plugging 130 mg. My nightcap dose of 100 mg plugged basically did nothing. I think with week plus tolerance breaks I could get decent effects for a session, but I really need to just get back to living life. Still gonna take small doses orally, it is unbelievable how smooth and euphoric of an antidepressant that ROA is.


there is still good mxe out there, my current batch looks exactly like the pre-ban euro stuff , very visual as well.

Even after 3 months of clean time and multiple bad batches received in the past that made me severely sick, I'm still chasing that heavenly M-hole. I don't see how I could ever give up this drug as long as it's available. I feel like I'm caught in the grips of an addiction that nobody in my personal life will ever understand.

It's getting harder and harder to find reliable sources on the clearnet. Most seem to be getting MXP, which I've had and is shit compared to MXE. All I got was amnesia and a bad taste in my mouth due to a lousy purchase. 


I wish I could have a few grams of the fluffy white stuff I use to receive back in the day.

Guys I'm trying really hard to finish my MXE book. I marvel at the scope of it every day I open it up to work on it, which has been every day recently. The good news is that its sitting at 120 pages and I'm trying to keep it at that length, so from this point forward I am only refining it, editing and adding citations/links wherever possible etc. so I should be ready to share near-final drafts with select enthusiasts in the next couple weeks. Let me know via PM if you would like to be an early reader.

Hey all,


I'm pretty experienced with MXE and have never had any issues. A friend of mine recently tried 35mg oral (from my batch, so I know it's fine). It was his first dissociative experience. He didn't have an amazing time, but that's probably due to set & setting and because he smoked weed before he knew where it was going.


Anyway, that's not the issue. Since then, he has been experiencing some bad tinnitus in just one ear. It is not there all the time, but sometimes it is bad enough that it is getting in the way of his life and sleep. When he lays down at night, it is a serious problem and is driving him mad. It has been ***one month since he dosed ***and it has not yet improved. ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)


Any suggestions? I have experienced what might be tinnitus on MXE, but it goes away eventually...


tl;dr - One month after dosing 35mg MXE, still has very bad tinnitus in one ear. What should he do?

^Tinnitus can be caused by effing anything in life. From what I've read, doctors don't know why people get it, nor do they have any solutions for it. Sometimes it just happens to people... for life. My girlfriend and her father both have tinnitus, and all they do is ignore it. That's all they *can* do. They've both had it for years, and it did not coincide with any specific event for either of them, just popped up out of nowhere one day.


 For your friend, it might go away, might not. Does he stay hydrated? I've found when I get a bad ringing in my ear, I'm usually very dehydrated. I've also found that the majority of people I know (and probably Americans in general) don't hydrate enough, so that would be the first thing I would check. I've never personally had any ear-ringing issues with MXE over my 100+ uses, so somehow I doubt your friend's issue is due simply to a single time use of MXE.

it wouldn't be the first case of dissociative-induced persisting tinnitus tho.


have they tried just taking an anti-inflammatory like tylenol or motrin?

He mentioned having some hearing issues when he was younger, but it hasn't been a problem for many many years. Obviously it could be the original source, but there's no question that the MXE has caused it to resurface (and worse than ever). He heard the crazy ringing as soon as the trip started and it hasn't gone away since then.

anti-inflammatories can aid healing in a lot of ways.... its easier for your body to put everything back in the right place if inflammation goes down.


just a random hunch i had, not sure if it will work or not.  it certainly can't hurt, though.


and yes, dissociative-induced tinnitus does go away eventually.  i have a friend who suffered from very painful tinnitus for years after major overuse of DXM... (we're talking grams a week for awhile)... and his tinnitus went away eventually.

^^ Thanks for the replies thus far. He feels like he can't live like this - it's seriously disrupting his life. He is going to see a doctor to see what can be done. I personally don't have high hopes that the doctor will be able to help much, but what should he tell the Dr?

After a few weeks you won't even think about it any more, trust me. I went most of the summer without it and I barely noticed. That first week or two away though... thought about it an awful lot. I always replace one vice with another though. Ended up blowing through a few zones of pot this summer, but at least I didn't snoot grams of mexxy for three months.

Once again I notice this cycle,, first day after a long break from good S-isomer material is very weird, maybe I dosed too hard because I was just so excited and ended up not sleeping a night. Took a break for a day and wow the second day of dosing is simply amazing, a great flow state, or 'tuned' as I say. Two doses of 30-35mg IV made for a very lucid 6 hours. I'm so tempted to dose again but my higher self is saying chill out and go to sleep, tomorrow will be good!

Definately agree with your "tuning" theory. The first dose after a break isnt usually all that pleasant but a day or 2 in i'll be in heaven! Need to watch my use of this stuff a bit more recently. Had my first week long run with a few weeks ago, had a week break then been dosing a couple ties a week. I find now I only dose out of boredom once I run out of weed. Back to uni now and have more commitments so i'll try and keep it to once or twice monthly at most.

I remember having some bad tinnitus years ago around when I first started doing DXM, it was really bad to the point where I couldn't sleep. And smoking weed made it way worse. I guess it just went away at some point after a few months and it doesn't bother me now. Never really got it from MXE though.

Naive user here just received 1 gram. instantly prepare a 20mg shot which i inject intramuscularly into the upper right quadrant of my glute. light-moderate effects. stumbling but barely any psychedelia. It was lovely no doubt about it. So whats your opinion on the quality of this stuff. White in appearance.

This has been my experience too. My best experiences were usually at the end of my binges, certainly never at the beginning of them. I would even go as far as to say best experiences in my whole life, even though they happened during one of the most depressive periods in my life. Just knowing such magic exists makes me happy, even when I no longer have access to it myself.

If tinnitus is due to aural perceptual processes being augmented by MXE, or maybe even if not, the software "Tinnitus Tamer" might help. It's theorized to desensitize one to the sound frequencies commonly associated with the subjective experience of tinnitus. Have him read up on the theory, and then try it out. It seems to work for some.

So instead of trying to finish my book this week I just created a boatload of new research for myself. It's very exciting because I am fleshing out a part of the book that was previously only touching on the subject. It has to do with the nature of consciousness, the underlying mechanisms that form consciousness, and getting to the root of how altered states such as with dissociative anesthetics alter these mechanisms. So what are these mechanisms? That's where it gets really interesting, and I am incorporating different pre-existing models of consciousness such as The Quantum Mind, Spin-Mediated Consciousness, Orch OR theory, quantum computation, putting them with some solid neuroscience data with our understanding of what goes on at the neurological level. I had a breakthrough when I realized how consciousness collapses the quantum wave function, and sure enough it is already a theory, David Chalmers has done quite a bit in the field. So I put all this together with the theory I'm developing that dissociatives/anesthetics and other drugs alter our interface with these quantum mechanisms and can fundamentally explain some of the phenomenology of these altered states. Consciousness has two major components: Awareness (i.e., the content of consciousness) and arousal (i.e. the level of consciousness). Arousal and awareness are usually positively correlated: When one's arousal decreases, so does one's awareness (rapid eye movement (REM) sleep being a notable exception). Awareness can also be divided into two components: Self-awareness and external awareness. Self- and external awareness usually behave in an anti-correlated manner. When you are engaged in self-related processes, you are less receptive to environmental demands, and vice versa. The interesting thing about dissociatives like ketamine and MXE is that through the NMDA antagonism it increases the oscillatory frequencies of alpha-peaks on the electroencephalographic power spectrum, which in other words increases arousal even while awareness is decreased, which explains how there is a sort of convergence in brain activity between dreaming and holing on MXE/ket. Specifically I've noticed that when I had a lucid dream recently the quality of the experience felt nearly the same as a 'lucid hole' that I had a couple days previously. What is going on at the quantum level is that it essentially increases our quantum computation capacity which is what we do when we imagine and dream and do other certain kinds of thinking. Where a 'normal' state of consciousness feels very 'defined' i.e. constantly collapsing the wave function, in a dissociated state there is more of a simultaneous collapsing and evolving of the quantum wave function, allowing the mind to superpose more effectively, but instead of losing the information before it can be collapsed into a defined state, the mind is still conscious enough due to the heightened arousal to be able to collapse it into a defined state. This is what I mean when I say I spend more time 'in the cloud' on MXE. This state does however come at the cost of diminishing some of our computing capacity more associated with left-brain processing, logic and such. 


Anyway wow that was a tangent and if anyone understood what I just said we should have a chat because its all still very much coming together. I'm also thinking I should just try to finish the rest of my book and come back to this stuff separately because this rabbit hole is massive.

I don't have any tips or suggestions, other than an anecdote that I got tinnitus as well when I started using MXE. I no longer get it, however. My last MXE evening was 220mg over the course of an evening (no weed - just 1mg etizolam at the end) and no tinnitus. It seems to have waned over time.

Very interesting stuff about the unconscious Vortech. I have become a lot more aware of it recently, after four or five years of regular MXE use. I have got to the point where in these "lucid holes" I am able to explore my unconscious, uncover the reasoning behind my thought patterns and emotions, and have even recently been able to "plant" ideas or thought processes into my unconscious which remain there in sobriety. These can be things like "you must forgive so and so", or staying motivated and happy. It's working for me anyway.

Recent experimentation with MXE for treatment of symptoms associated with ASD (Asperger's) has come up with some nice results. A dose of as little as 5-10mg intranasal is enough to combat high levels of social anxiety and even promotes extroverted behaviour ie, social reciprocation, social awareness. Over a week long period 5-10mg was ingested before scheduled work shift(s), enough of a dose to reduce the input of sensory stimuli (a big problem) but still remain alert and able to process computations and handle communication with customers. Overall levels of anxiety and low self worth were negligible, whilst levels of motivation and willingness to undertake novel tasks were increased. Negatives come in the form a depressed state if dose is not kept continual, which could prove harmful if psychological dependence occurs. However recreational doses were administered during the period, which could attributed to these states.


A side note: MXE + cannabis (indica dominant strain) has favourable results for for sensory sensitivity and feelings of self worth, more trials must be run before long term results can be concluded.

The meta-programming capabilities of MXE (and other dissociatives for that matter) seem profound. I enjoy the ability to ingest a dissociative and let my brain reorganise data and form new and ever increasingly novel structures. It's like a computational meditation.

This reminds me of a short blip in my book about helping you remember. As we know, MXE, especially in higher doses, can fuck with memory processing, so when we stumble upon those really important or profound realizations, things we want to take back with us to integrate in sobriety, how do we ensure we remember it? My answer is through symbols. 

The mind likes to associate. Association is why symbols are powerful, especially considering symbols that represent the same thing to a whole group of people. But we can have personal symbols as well as a tool to help us remember, like a map that shows us how to get to that deep corner in our brain. A symbol is not a message, it is only a vessel for the message. It's like a compression algorithm in the sense that you can represent lots of information with a single image. 

My point is when you are deep in an m-hole things can get pretty free-associated. If you find yourself in a place you want to remember but probably won’t because it’s just so fucking weird that the mind can’t compartmentalize it, associate it with something that is easier to handle- an image, idea or a related memory, something that is powerful to you. Think of it as a souvenir from your trip. This will help you remember the next time you recall that image in sobriety.

Vortech: I'm even more fascinated to read your book now (no pressure ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)).  The stuff you were talking about regarding mxe's possible links with consciousness collapsing the waveform is interesting, although many theoretical physicists are these days leaning towards the Many Worlds hypothesis, which requires no waveform collapse, and therefore 'seems' more 'logical' (except for the small matter of 10^100 universes one particle different all laid on top each other (plus all the really different ones)) - have you considered this hypothesis in what you're writing?  Seems just as much opportunity for mxe's/consciousness' effects to be interpreted (from a different angle) using that model (whether that tells us more about mxe than physics is another question).  


David Deustch's book Fabric of Reality is good on many worlds - also have you read Penrose's Emperor's New Mind (stuff about quantum consciousness linked to microtubules surrounding cells) (i may be distracting you from finishing your book now...)

mxe scene is pretty rough :-( It seems to have pretty much dissapeared.


  Have my fingers and toes crossed on one source that is supposed to be bringing some legit MXE to market any day now. 


I really do wonder if it is some kind of concerted effort bc of the effects mxe has on prana type energy and the other various effects that could be construed as condusive to spiritual evolution. 


Just ordered some 3 meo pcp to try finally bc there is no fucking MXE worth buying that I know of.

From what I had read a while back (someone correct me if I'm wrong) MXE was made illegal in China not so long ago. All I personally conclude from the dearth of MXE right now is what I already knew: all the MXE comes from China. It's pretty funny that now some well-renowned "genuine European MXE" vendors all of a sudden no longer have any product to sell. What a coincidence!

All I personally conclude from the dearth of MXE right now is what I already knew: all the MXE comes from China. It's pretty funny that now some well-renowned "genuine European MXE" vendors all of a sudden no longer have any product to sell. What a coincidence!

I'm out of resources to finish my book. I need a job to sustain myself and taking that path will put the book on the backburner. I tried making a kickstarter campaign to raise funding to buy me some time to dedicate myself to finishing the work, but kickstarter declined it saying it was 'outside of their scope'. I guess it is too radical a subject for them to associate with.

Well...

I'm alive. Vortech is alive and as meshuga as ever, writing a book on mxe. I have just received 3 grams of s-isomer mxe pure as any of the grams upon grams i've ever ordered dating back to 2011. Coming off my most recent 5 month long hiatus from mxe, I am beginning to feel first alerts. Today I try to "tune in." Tomorrow will be glorious, and I will be going to see one of my favorite dubstep artists. All is right for the moment

Yeah SONN I'm fairly certain the most passionate MXE enthusiasts are all deep music lovers who have all found a special sort of enlightenment when combining it with the right music. I can talk for days about why/how MXE brings us closer to music, and it is a primary theme of my book.

FuckUwil$on that's why it's good to have benzo on hand with these drugs. However, I've been where you are, and you can power through it especially if u keep on the MXE wave until you get a chance to really crash, the body can be forgiving on one day of restlessness, you'll just sleep harder the next day.

Seems like we're all reaching the same conclusions at the same time. What's the significance of this? I don't want to speculate but I'll say that the past week has been the best of my life and MXE deserves a lot of the credit, or maybe it was inside me all along. Anyways try MXE with 4-FA if you haven't yet, they play very nicely together.

Careful with that combo as it could induce serotonin syndrome. It could be safe if the doses are staggered, but if combined at the same time it could overload your receptors and cause harm.


Edit...if I may speculate on the notion you brought up ecstacylover, it appears to be an element of shared consciousness. It is not so hard to believe we are entangled in a non-local space-time through a common chemical bond. Further speculation is even more metaphysical in nature but also perfectly explainable through phenomena of quantum mechanics. I like to think of MXE as being a sort of radio antennae, and each molecule is a sympathetic resonator of a spectrum of energies mediated by the direction of consciousness, which also explains why music feels so much closer when tuned in.

That quite reminds me of William Blake. Rather old notion that is, older than MXE itself. To me, MXE is both the riddle and the answer in the same package. Sort of like the question "what is the meaning of life?". Deep shit, that's for sure. Deep enough to get folks psychotic and lost down the rabbit hole. Deep enough to motivate some out of the same hole. Multi-dimensional one might say. They say MDMA is magic, I scoff at the notion, they clearly haven't truly explored MXE. I envy the ones that can moderate their use. For me it seems I can only commit or abstain.

Well said Fnx! 

MXE is not the Universe, but it is a key, a key to unlock the capacity of the mind to imagine and to materialize our reality. Since we are realizing according to many theoretical physicists and philosophers that the Universe only really exists inside the mind, MXE is not only a key to unlock our mind, but to unlock the Universe itself. Understanding consciousness and its mechanisms I believe will help us unlock our understanding of the Universe and its mechanisms. The mind is a prism, where all the energy of the Universe flows as a hot mess of white light into our channels where it is parsed and decoded into its component colors, giving definition to the chaos.

Bass, especially above a certain threshold of amplitude, has a very physical quality that produces physiological responses in the body. The low frequencies produce different effects dependent on resonant frequencies within the body. A famous example is [the 'brown note'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_note) at which a certain frequency when played at a high enough amplitude can actually cause the receiver to lose their bowels. I theorize that MXE, being a sort of amplifier of these energies, increases the perception of these effects.

lol I know about the brown note, thankfully they didn't include that particular waveform! after reading the wikipedia page im guessing it isn't anything anyone has to worry about, if it does indeed exist.


also something about the bass was definitely having a pretty obvious effect, because I would be dancing and getting ready for the drop then when the drop would happen I would hole and almost fall over. this was on a hit of LSD and a bit more than 80 mg of MXE.

Been gone a while, I originally posted about how I kept collapsing from MXE.


I thought about it, it might be due to all the diphenidine/mxp/ephedine going around. I think there was a slightly yellow tinge to it but I'm actually quite color blind lol (fail every color test online). All mxe i've gotten has been white crystalline and some appeared white *enough* to be considered real I guess. 2 batches were obviously something else because they were very yellow or tan and were still pretty fun but not water soluble.


I was pretty pissed at the 3 times i collapsed/passed out and got rushed to the ER. esp cuz i have a scar on my face from it now -.-. I doubt most people would run into this though because every time I had consumed way over .2 rectally...


i'd like to see the book you wrote vortch, i just hope it doesnt have to do with all this "metaprogramming" shit. I know what it feels like to have that antidepressant mxe feel that your changing your brain and self-actualizing, like improving yourself..but once it wears off i think your just left your normal shitty self lol.(jk)

dissociative naive people can feel "altered" for a very long time after even just their first dose.  it isn't common, but it does happen.  for some people it goes away.  some people say it never really goes away.  i wonder how much of it is psychosomatic hypochondria, but it happens often enough that i think there's at least some truth to it.


for most people it goes away eventually, though, even if it takes a month or two.  i've got a theory that taking another smaller dose can help bring you back down to normalcy, but idk if i can really recommend that route until more brave/foolhardy people attempt it.

It's really important that dissociative niave people have a guide/tripsitter present on their first trial, or at least thave knowledge of the effects and what kind of set/setting is appropriate. MXE is better than many dissociatives because it tends to be more forgiving in this aspect at least in lower doses. So it is possible thid wasn't MXE. Like phatmakos mentioned though it can have a strong impact on the mind that lasts for days afterwards. An NMDA agonist can help the brain return to normal, or any activity that helps reassociate the mind to the body. I don't know what this person experienced during their trip, but it may just take some time and intentional effort to integrate the experience.

Is there such a thing as returning to being the same person after a meaningful experience? Well that is if you wanna get all lame or technical about it. I read about 4-MA being able to change an individual's personality with one time use (I quote Erny IIRC), fucking up a lot of serotonergy..


Yes NMDA antagonists disturb that whole cognitive system and especially with continued use it can really take some time to regain certain abilities - I had problems, minor with language but more with orientation in space/time and planning. That is a sensitive thing for me (high functioning autism etc), but it was after extensive use of K, later MXE.


Some people get serious ripples in the pond after a single time use of LSD or another psychedelic, some people are extremely sensitive - I guess perhaps due to receptor polymorphism / populations or something we don't quite understand yet. May also be true for dissociatives, it's definitely true for some adolescents that smoke cannabis with a certain form of a gene and psychosis / similar issue risks. Might even be the same gene forming these problems.


I feel a deep trench separating me from my older self, but yeah after all self experimentation its impossible to say what really messed me up (although I also feel extra gifted), or it would have to be my second shroom (OD ish) trip that was the most profound and spiritual experience to date. I embrace whatever remains of my altered life, pointless to dwell on alternate possibilities.

its worth noting that i also experienced some long-term "alteration" after i started experimenting with dissociatives.  i'm a different case because i kept using them, but at this point in my usage (been using dissociatives for 8 years) i feel like i've broken through and now memories of my pre-dissociative self feel very much a part of me, rather than feeling like some other person who i happened to share a body with.

Hard to believe it's been over 5 years since Wiz dropped Kush and OJ, I guess time flies when your having fun. MXE will not be stopped, no chance if you ask me. Let's keep metaprogramming, freeing our minds, blaring our music, having fun, and staying true to ourselves. It's only 2015, MXE guide us into the future.

So if mxe does indeed get banned which I have hears its a rumor, how long until its picked up by people illegal producing ketamine,mdma, or other banned RC's like 2c-b??


Also anyone have any tips on re-Xing mxe similar to dmt??


Really hope it is just a rumor

It is finally officially banned. It was directly listed in the word document attached to the [announcement on the Chinese FDA website](http://www.sfda.gov.cn/WS01/CL0056/130753.html).

^No, it was most definitely outside pressure IMO. China banned a very long list of RC's ranging from the original 2C-x drugs to weird new stimulants, and it happened to include MXE. Seems like something the U.S. government had its hand in to me.

So saddened that I arrived at the party late. only ever purchased 2g of mxe and im nearing the end of my stash. sad times. This is definitely one of the most intriguing chems I've come across. Its able to bring me comfortably deep, provide existential questions with answers provided while being relatively easy on the body, amazing stuff.

That is a sensitive thing for me (high functioning autism etc), but it was after extensive use of K, later MXE.

Have you tried anything like piracetam,  aniracetam or noopept to counter these symptoms? 

I found that these can help the next morning or after a few times of use.

Would you all agree that good MXE has an effect that can only be summed up as a life force amplifier? I've been thinking about this, how it could be a true medicine for people who suffer life force deficiencies. Of course I have to define what I mean by life force, at the core it is the strength of the energy field, and It manifests physiologically as an increase in heart rate and blood pressure. This happens to everyone right? It doesn't require a certain set and setting because it seems to just work every time, at least in my experience. The energy amplifier has an overclocking effect on certain functions of the brain which allows it to do things it can't normally do. Its different from ketamine in this way. Ketamine provides the dissociation but without the energy amplification. It feels more like a transparent dissociative in comparison


Anyway that's just one of my hundreds of dissociated thoughts of the morning.


I feel like the China ban is going to be very good for the quality of the MXE market if and when it starts circulating again. Most Chinese labs that produced it did not understand how sensitive this compound is, the nuances that create a 'harmonious' molecule at end of the process. I'm not a chemist so I don't know what those things are, but I can tell the difference in subjective effects, whether it is tuned to allow true spiritual awakening or merely glimpses or simulations of higher states.

I think I was just high but I remember last time I had a quarter of MXE I swear I felt an energy force around the stuff. I think I was just high but I was very convinced that there was energy around it for some reason. I always ended up putting it in strange places and forgetting where it was but that irrelevant because the people I was around were trying to flush it. Whenever I've done high dose MXE or K there are huge energy waves and vibrations that go up and down my body in like a trance or just interesting pattern. Like it feels like the waves of universe someone mentioned which I agree with. Also a couple times I legit was trying to not move and my body kept dancing/spinning around to the music that was playing it was WEIRD.

We are projecting machines. We project onto the world what we have in ourselves. Then energy we feel from without actually originates from within. The energy that is focused by MXE is that same libidinal energy that comes in waves, here and there, bursting forth as orgasm: as discursive projection. The same energy that brought us into the world now brings to the world our mental creations.


Close your eyes and there is no anxiety. This raw, undifferentiated creative force waxes and wanes, sloshes and stirs, excites and relaxes. Open your eyes and you wash up on the shore of projective ecstasy: wherever your mind is now, the universe seems to have been waiting for you there. Of course the universe is in actuality indifferent, but *you *are different. There you are, and there she is, and the two have met and are one for a moment.


It was just for a moment, mind you. Orgasm, no matter how stretched out, finally fades to anxiety, impatience, frustration, confusion. But what is this frustration? You want to do more MXE. You want to go there again. You want to sustain the unsustainable. Even more than this, you don't want to look at this fear and pain, right here, right now. More than anything, you wish to escape this moment. You wish to sleep, or to distract yourself, or to get high again.


Though it pains you so, the life force is not deficient. The understanding of life is deficient. Look at this pain that you wish to escape. Make friends with your frustration. Freedom awaits.

Since we are in the topic of life force 


This happened back in early 2012..


My wife them was pregnant with our second child, and one night after a nice long day of binging some MXE I went and knelt beside the bed where she was sleeping and put my head up to her stomach, and I swear I was having communication via some super natural force with my baby....it was one of the coolest experiences of my life

Me and my buddy have a weird reaction. I usually get happy, relaxed and have very psychedelic effects on Ketamine, but my friend gets depressed.

I however don't feel MXE as being fun or anything. It's just something I have used to "get f*cked up" and not explore my mind, as I tend to do with K. 

But my friend loves MXE, gets happy and prefers it. I thought It was only Ketamine that made people happy, that's even why they are having the studies here in hospitals, giving people IV K to see how it deals with their depression. 


So I'm guessing that they will, without a doubt, look into MXE in the future for those who don't have/feel the anti-depressant reaction that most are feeling in the ketamine experiments. Just like with regular SSRIs, some doctors completely skip them with some people. And end up giving them a low dose of say Tramadol or Adderall or something. Adderall is used as a last hope in treatment resistant depression.


I remember the last time I did a masssive dose of MXE -- Massive because as I said, there's nothing in it for me as far as what I tend to like substances for (Exploring the psyche, consciousness, spiritual reasons, etc...). I felt I had to hold onto things and I was looking through some device that made my vision seem so far away from my body. They almost became two seperate entities. But if it was a massive K dose. I would've taken a while walking in my house, But I wouldn't feel the need to hold onto things. Or I would've just closed my eyes and my spirit would've left my body and went out in space, or other parts of my city, as It sometimes does with a medium dose of S+ isomer Ketamine.

The current draft of my Multidisciplinary MXE Analysis book has been shared with a group of BL MXE heads for the purposes of getting feedback from the community! I want it to be a community project and the foundation of an eventual 'Nexus' for dissociatives research. Liquid crystals of information. Maybe in a Wiki style that lets the community evolve it fluidly; Google Docs interface might work as well? Let me know if you are willing and able to contribute feedback right now. Thanks!

My time with MXE is coming to an end. It feels bittersweet to say the least. I'd like to go out with a bang though. I had 2 x 40 mg doses this morning,

165 mg plugged is the endgame.

It's so hard to put a finger on what exactly MXE offers me. It's intangible but I keep coming back for it. I have plans that I can't accomplish while dissociated, so that's why I need to curb my usage.       I've done 9 grams in the past month which is the most I've done in such a short interval of time in my life. I've had some crazy and bizzare experiences that I wouldn't take back. A couple that stand out to me are as follows: one: sitting out by the pool while in an M-hole and being forced to contemplate life. Heaven or Hell? Is it real? What if it was? That would be a terrible thing to burn for all eternity. And who's side am I on? I was shown that I was on the dark side. Should I embrace it? I don't think so, I think I should try to get away from it. That was scary, because I like to think I'm a pretty positve and good person and so that was confusing for me. I do believe in karma so going forward this experience made me want to be a better person.        Another cool thing that I've had happen on multiple occasions in the past month is these sort of lucid dream hole states. Where my body is sleeping but my mind is aware. Sometimes it's been the result of huge MXE doses where my consciousness transcends into the void of nothingness (somewhat similar to a K-hole I believe) , but also at other times where I haven't even been under the influence of MXE and these dream states have befallen me at night. I think it is a product of the work I've done in the past year involving meditation, mindfulness, and MXE metabolites still present in my body that are allowing me to slip into these dream states despite not being directly under the influence of MXE at the time.       The big bang journey must have been great, I don't have any recall of it. I have one gram left and I'm going to do that until its gone. Then I'll take a break for awhile because when I have MXE around I just can't get anything done. It's like being in hibernation. And I'm ready to come out of hibernation for awhile.

What kind of doses do y'all take to reach the M-Hole? I've never really dosed past about 80-90mg in one session, and I have to wonder when I see that y'all have been taking larger doses, if I'm missing out on the true power of MXE by being reserved about dosing so high.

Without tolerance it should be in the 70mg-90mg range. Best done with a small dose one hour before the full dose (say 10mg-20mg) and then the other 50mg-70mg. Sublingual and plugged works best for holing too IMO. Insufflated not so much.


Vortech, I've read some of and skimmed through your MXE book draft and I love it so far.

Just so happens one of my vendors just restocked on MXE so I'm hoping to have some sent my way by this weekend. ?

Thanks Sean ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) 

The amount of work I have done just in the past 10 days or so has been nothing short of incredible thanks in part to some feedback from you guys helping me to focus the big picture as it crystallizes. I have a couple more things on the to-do list, but expect a post here next week with a public link to the document.

I have plans that I can't accomplish while dissociated, so that's why I need to curb my usage.       I've done 9 grams in the past month which is the most I've done in such a short interval of time in my life. I've had some crazy and bizzare experiences that I wouldn't take back. A couple that stand out to me are as follows: one: sitting out by the pool while in an M-hole and being forced to contemplate life. Heaven or Hell? Is it real? What if it was? That would be a terrible thing to burn for all eternity. And who's side am I on? I was shown that I was on the dark side. Should I embrace it? I don't think so, I think I should try to get away from it. That was scary, because I like to think I'm a pretty positve and good person and so that was confusing for me. I do believe in karma so going forward this experience made me want to be a better person.        Another cool thing that I've had happen on multiple occasions in the past month is these sort of lucid dream hole states. Where my body is sleeping but my mind is aware. Sometimes it's been the result of huge MXE doses where my consciousness transcends into the void of nothingness (somewhat similar to a K-hole I believe) , but also at other times where I haven't even been under the influence of MXE and these dream states have befallen me at night. I think it is a product of the work I've done in the past year involving meditation, mindfulness, and MXE metabolites still present in my body that are allowing me to slip into these dream states despite not being directly under the influence of MXE at the time.       The big bang journey must have been great, I don't have any recall of it. I have one gram left and I'm going to do that until its gone. Then I'll take a break for awhile because when I have MXE around I just can't get anything done. It's like being in hibernation. And I'm ready to come out of hibernation for awhile.

Funny you mention the lucid dream effects. I find the night of sleep after using MXE gives me these strange lucid dreams where I feel i'm sitting in my bed, upright with my laptop on my lap while simultaneously being aware that i'm in fact laying down sleeping.

Again, good to see the lucid hole description being mentioned. We all, whether want to admit it or not, embody both a dark and light side within us. The difference is in the conscious decision to project/amplify one side or the other through our actions. Dissociatives can help us see both of those sides, and I feel that through that unbiased perspective we tend to move towards the light side. It is OK to recognize both sides, it is only human, but in the end how we end up acting upon that realization will determine the karmic implications.

I guess I'll have to read your book, because I'd like to understand what you mean. Is the light sided with energy, creativity, and openness? Is the dark sided with selfishness, uncertainty and depression?


Are you suggesting that logic can guide the mind out of depression and inaction?

I myself found contemplation in the Bhagavad Gita, it explains our world in detail, and personally I find it resonates intensely with my own psychedelic experiences.

Listening,  the yin-yang symbol, though ancient, still resonates with humanity for a reason. The whole requires a duality to exist as a unity, and the smaller circle of black in the white and vice versa denotes that they are not mutually exclusive. Every light casts a shadow, and darkness needs light in order to have 'form'.

Apologies for taking the thread into philosophy territory, but as we know MXE can catalyze contemplation and conceptualization. Someone in one of this thread's early iterations coined it 'philosopher's heroin'. Personally I liken that term closer to Ketamine because it is more sedative. MXE is an energetic dissociative that not only allows mind-manifestation, it provides an energy with which the visioneer has a window of opportunity to bring the vision into reality in some way. I think of it as world-bridging tool, whereas Ketamine tends to keep the dream relegated to the dream world.

The first question- uncertainty is not dark nor light, it is the line that separates the sides, one step away from choosing its form.


Selfishness is not dark, it is simply the self, maybe driven by unchecked ego, lacking compassion/consideration for 'other'.

Selfishness *is* an imbalance in the self-other duality, but that is not to say the self is dark and the other is light, that concept doesn't hold water.


Depression, yeah that is a result of too much time spent in the darkness. It is a lack of feeling connection. Perhaps the connections are still there and they just need a light shines on them. Other cases the connections do wither away, that is more associated with treatment resistant depression in which MXE is a wonderful tool because it has the effect of regrowing those connections as well as shining lights on the connections still intact.

The second question- sure why not, I have seen a change in mind set flip entire lives around. But I think logic is only an example of one side, left-brain comprehension. A spark in right-brain comprehension is at least as important. Together they make a whole understanding of inner truth and realize it is all a choice, and knowing there is an option is all most people need to choose to open their eyes, see the light, embody it, radiate it, celebrate it.

I thought it may have been a premonition of the bans/unavailability. I.e. south Kansas is MXE, bye bye my darling it was a good run but its time to come back to north Kansas or something like that. Either that or yeah that wizard of oz or even the matrix reference when cypher said kansas is going bye bye before neo leaves the matrix.

I've only had 3 or 4 days sober from MXE so far and it feels like it's been weeks. The first few days were pretty depressing but I think my moods stabilized, still feel a complete lack of motivation and connection to the outside world though. As bad as it sounds I want nothing more than to go back to it.


One thing i find odd though is despite how much MXE interferes with formation of new memories, it also at times provides greatly increased mental recall for past events. And I find myself suddenly recalling suppressed memories that I hadn't thought of in years.

The vivid past memory recall, like you said of sometimes suppressed memories, can be really intense. A while ago I was listening to a song I made 15 years ago and suddenly remembered listening to it with my first girlfriend, my first love, and i was overwhelmed with love like I haven't felt in ages. It was like my heart chakra cracked open. Heat radiated from my chest. I guess I had suppressed a lot of those feelings because you know, those memories can be painful when the love is lost. So I started crying, wells of tears, and it continued for over an hour. Luckily I was able to contact her through Facebook and have a chat to work it out. I learned a lot that night. I haven't been the same since, having reconnected myself to the feeling of pure love. If that isn't healing I don't know what is.

I know a lot of people need healing like this. If your heart has become cold from the loss of so much love, next time you are on a dissociative, try to bring those feelings back. Listen to the music you heard when you first fell in love, imagine the energy of holding their hand or embrace, dig up the memories that you hid away because they became painful at some point or another. I might just be a transformative experience.

Vivid recall of past memories was one of the most profound things about MXE. I haven't had those since the first few times doing MXE though and again with 300mg of DXM and cannabis once. That was the real magic of dissociatives, which seems to be long gone by now.

I have definitely noticed a marked improvement in memory - both short-term and long-term - since regularly taking MXE. I'm wondering if it aids in some sort of healing or regeneration of the brain? I used to be as forgetful as hell but now I'm far more motivated and better at remembering stuff - my wife is delighted about this! Or maybe it's just that the increased motivation/positive thought MXE gives you simply makes you *want* to remember stuff more?

Nicely put! I am certainly finding it has vastly enhanced my professional, personal and family life if not abused. Abuse potential is obviously a danger, but I can credit this substance with sealing certain work deals, driving creative projects and improving my marriage.

Unfortunately it has been around 6 months since i have been in mexico an my friends use to refer to it as. But if i rewind back to 6 months ago prior to that i was on it every single day without interlude for somewhere between 2-3 years. Unlike many others my experience is unique in that i came off it cold for a reason that was absolutely not that i had or have any desire to not be on it even stranger still is the complete lack of any withdrawl symptom even to this day i never felt even the most mild severance symptom. The main topic id like to enquire about tho is a in search for whatever similar experiences other BL members might have had.

   So the effect im going to ask about by all logic does not exist, and further than that is impossible by the standard parameters of everyday reality. What i am driving in the direction of i guess I could word as MXE's effect on beings and or objects outside of its range of direct connection with. for example say I and a group of my peers are all under the influence of mxe people/odjects im writing this post about would be anyone or anything myself or the any member ot the group under the influence of MXE comes in contact with. These people are not directly under the influence of MXE but are somehow subject to the substances and intentions or desires. after using MXE daily and often in ammounts much larger than i would have believed possible when i first discovered the substance I got kind of acclimated to its effects sort of used to it. at least i had adapted to being on it in every waking moment enough that i was making a lot of observations that had previously went over my head. Now this I have put a lot of thought into i have recieved alike experiences from a lot of people using MXE as well as affirmation from those that were not on MXE but crossed paths with people on it................sorry if this is not making sense i promice it is about to!!!!!!


   Have many of you found that in using MXE constantly everything and I mean Every single thing seems to work out in the best that it could work out? I'm saying sort of beyond a level that could realistically be written off as mere coincidense? I am not alone wittnessing this phenomena in my area MXE was big I have many good friends that also were or still are daily users as well and I don't know any i could name that havent experienced this whenever on MXE. Stranger still is the larger ammount of friends or aquaintances that donot do it some of whom have never done it but none the less seem at a loss for how to explain the appearant magical quality of MXE as far as uniteing people in direction so that everyone moves together with the same propulsion. People On it or so it would appear even just around  MXE seems to have an effect on any conciousness in the vicinity that removes some kind of mental wall that as far as i can hypothesize is responsible for misinterperitation and misunderstanding as people around suddenly become genuine and you understand themas they really are. With everyone involved coming from this genuine place and becoming able to accurately interperate things at first glance error is somehow removed from the equation along with deception. The result is for Harry Potter readers the true realization of the felix felicious potion.......everything works out every time without fail even when you see it and know that is what is happening one could not even stop it ones wanted to throw a wrench in the mix.... 


    I would chak this experience completely up to braindamage and settle for the answer of you sir went way way way too far with the drugs if this were just a me expirience. Like I said there are far too many people that just I know, let alone whoever they associate with, that either expirience the same sort of what im gonna start refering to as god mode or cant deny wittenessing it whenever MXE is introduced to the environment. wittness on a level that surpasses that which could be just coincidence....... There must be something to this tell me you are or have experienced something that you would have to just call god mode there must be many more of us!!!!!

Disco Doctor, like others have said, in moderation MXE can have postitive effect on memory, and yes it is believed to repair synapses damaged from stress/depressions/addiction and promote neurogenesis *at the right dose levels*.


seth_7re, if this was an isolated experience it could be chalked up to brain damage, hyperactive imagination etc, but the fact that so many people report this exact strange phenomenology of 'diffused consciousness' or many words I could use to describe it, implying that consciousness is not completely isolated to the brain leads to some credibility. The exciting thing is that the science of consciousness acknowledges this as a real possibility based on the theories such as quantum elements of consciousness. Thank you for sharing your experience. I am currently in the final read-through of my MXE book which addresses the phenomenology of dissociated consciousness. Check back here, Sunday at the latest, for a link to the book.

Seriously if I was rich I would be throwing all my money at formal MXE research, and one of the first experiments would be exploring possibility for telepathic phenomena, and like you mentioned the receivers don't even need to be under the influence if the sender is under the influence! Myself and many other users have had far too many experiences that are otherwise not explainable without some sort of '6th sense' communication. I have often found myself as the director of a room's energy when I am on MXE (even a low dose amount), where everyone gives me undivided attention, wide-eyed like they hardly ever would when I am sober. I would like to figure out what exactly makes the difference so maybe I could gain that ability without needing MXE.

And the way that intentions are manifested relatively effortlessly, it's like that infamous movie 'The Secret' brought to life ha!

Listen to  the music you heard when you first fell in love, imagine the energy of  holding their hand or embrace, dig up the memories that you hid away  because they became painful at some point or another. I might just be a  transformative experience.

I would often listen to random songs from like 5 years  ago on repeat, actually on MXE I hardly listen to new music at all. I've  never actually sat down and tried to make a therapeutic experience of  it like you do, definitely gonna have to try that. I often end up  thinking about past loves on MXE too, and it often ends up with me  randomly contacting them on social media and reminiscing from a very  manic standpoint.


Now granted I don't really use in moderation,  but I have a hard time buying it's gonna improve long-term and  especially short-term memory. Sure it helps with streamlining certain  thought-processes and the freeing of associations helps lateral  thinking, but as far as brute force brainpower goes I can only see it  diminishing with any MXE use that might be considered recreational.


I'm  not even saying that MXE makes you overall dumber. Because I feel like I  could solve more difficult engineering/math type problems than ever  before (of course that could have happened regardless). But no doubt it  slows down your train of thought big-time, decreases verbal  intelligence, and fucks mainly short-term but also long-term memory. (If  I recall one memory but lose 10 more I don't feel my memory is  improving)

I know before I got into dissociatives and such I had like  almost photographic memory. Now it's nowhere near that. I guess I  haven't had much time off in the past year though and with some healthy  living for a while maybe I'll revert back.


As always YMMV, and I guess I'm speaking more towards the crowd of recreational users here.

For sure....I never found any positive cognitive attributes to it....it made me dumb


But I was also doing a ton of benzos, pot, and booze with it


FWIW after a couple of months sober the fog lifted and I was back to my old self. I haven't done MXE or benzos for over 3 1/2 years now, and have only smoked pot a handful of times in that period. My memory is pretty much back to where it was before I started into the harder stuff.....I smoked pot for 17 years from sun up to sun down and I know that it did have lasting negatives to my memory.

Maybe it is just an aspect of permatolerance, but I hardly experience trouble verbalizing on MXE the past 2-3 years, on the contrary because of the 'streamlined' effect, MXE turns me into a very affluent and inflected speaker that engages the core of the listener's consciousness, intentionally grabbing shared connections to increase impact. My empathic reception increases allowing me to respond emotionally which in turn inflects the words. Maybe it is slightly slower, and I may look strange as I flair my arms and perform a range of impassioned facial expressions as I state my flow, but it certainly doesn't impair my communications abilities in low-to-medium doses.

Oh man that picture of a freebase MXE crystal is a thing of beauty. Very interesting! I wonder though, if it could be used as the 'crack' of MXE and if it would even be pleasant.

I do, prefer MXE to Ketamine. Longer lasting, it doesn't clog up my nose (low oral bioavailability), and K doesn't have the energy to keep active thought rolling. Need I mention a good 5-7 times cheaper when considering the extra potency and duration? K is *expensive* around here.

On K I feel like I have an epiphany every ten minutes or so and the rest of the time I am basically unconscious, evolving the quantum wave function. On MXE the time scale between epiphenies decreases by at least 3-5 times.

I totally agree that at lower doses communication is more fluid. I guess it's so easy for me to forget just how versatile MXE is. At high doses though, communication becomes mangled and muted. At times it's like being in one of those dreams where you know what you want to say, but when you try to speak nothing comes out. I was more referring to 100+ mg doses. Definitely on the lower doses words just come to you and speaking eloquently is so much easier.

Whatever, I stay by my word. Maybe you can abide to moderation, but I couldn't. I honestly think most people who use these substances have a problem their trying to cope with. The fact that people use the word "meta-programming" their minds or "tuning themselves" is just complete delusional talk. Reminds me of my old friend who used DXM for a year every day saying he was creating artificial intelligence and learned how to control minds. People who do dissociatives often are drug addicts. For you who preach that it is good for you, you have a problem. I've had a serious addiction to these substances and am not biased or anything. They will give you rhabodomyolsis over time ruining your muscles and kidneys. You will not feel pain and overexert yourself and not know. I'm not spewing bullshit, I been through heaven and hell with dissociatives trust me.

I'm not going to post here ever again either. I have better things to do. I'm just updating my thoughts about what I've learned from using these substances. YMMV and I don't mean disrespect to anyone.

As much as I love MXE, I can really vibe with what you're saying here. When this thread became a constant stream of "flesh of god" and "meta-programming" talk... I just couldn't connect with what people were saying any longer. I still use MXE every few weeks, but coming in here and seeing the talk that some of us disso heads talk... it worries me. It's what keeps my usage in check.

It's what keeps my usage in check.

Ha, people do that with psychedelics aka DMT/entities. I don't really care for it but as long as people don't go to deep with it, I don't see to much harm. I mean who knows mang, maybe dimitri does force fuck your third eye open and channel long dead ancestors or connect you to aliens.

I know you weren't really being offensive but DatAfricanAmericanPersonJ is running around the dissociative threads rambling about how he's better than us preaching about overcoming his demons or some other nonesense, and I can be pretty sarcastic, so I decided to flip it around a bit.

Dat african american j lmao thats great. Its nigga not nigger lol. I'm not actually black and no racism intented, its all slang but w/e. 


I didnt mean to talk like I was overcoming demons, but trying to relate to you dissoc heads by saying "i been though heaven and hell with dissociatives". Im saying ive had good times but i've come to realization that the stuff is bad. I think I went a little far in my rant, but I do honestly think many of you are delusional on them and I do believe dissociatives are damaging to the kidneys and muscles. It takes a hell of a lot of abuse to do big damage with them but I'm just reflecting on my use. I used to do 1g of mxe a day pretty easily at points... The stimulant effects and numbing effects of mxe together is bad for the body IMO. Its dehydrating, pushing your body to perform to longer extents while numbing any pain you may feel.


I remember vividly that I felt like I had some superhuman strength on the stuff, especially deep into the binge. I could stretch my body farther than I could without drugs. I could walk/run for long distances for long periods of time without feeling as tired or as much pain.


Serious addiction is substances is known to be damaging to matter what and dissociatives are certainly a culprit. I think they cause really strong delusions as well. The time dialation effect on them can be very euphoric but I've felt to be really scarey at times too. The meta programming talk and tuning yourself is the biggest evidence of delusions I've seen.


My opinion is that people seeing entities on DMT and psychadelics ect are somewhat delusional too. They alter perception and maybe they see what they see as an entity of their life thru a vison. Its all opinion what you believe in. Fuck sake go to an AA/NA meeting especially where meth is prevelant and listen to what they say about demons/god ect


Mxe is not improving anyone life it is simply getting you high.


I don't mean to be attacking people, but when someone is claiming to be spending ridiculous amounts of time writing a 100 page book on mxe I have to be brutally honest.


I did have an interest to read it, but i don't anymore. It would be a waste of time to read that much bullshit. It sounds like more of a diary combined with a bunch of opinions and delusions of how you feel on dissociatives.Thats a fucking problem mate, from the bottom of my heart...find something better to do.


Sorry, not sorry.


As I said earlier. I don't have time but I wasted enough of my life on these drugs to at least spend some time reflecting on what they did to me to warn others.

Wow, so much hate on a book that you've *never even read*. Are you assuming things? And what's really rude is to talk like that about something someone put so much work into. It's obvious your a very closed-minded, hypocritical, and negative person - MXE is about being non-judgemental, true to yourself, and positive. Good luck, homie.

well It was at 4th night on mxe and this time I want little bit more and from another and suposed best mxe...like more yellow and more smooth on the nose. 

Start at 8 with +-17mg, mild efects

the I was thinking wierd things. Loose the magic or something like this.

At 22 or so redosing with 15mg more, I was a little bad triping, not chill at all

It was very cold list night like 5º outside. Then I star hearing wierd things at the building, knocking and stomping I hear it even with the headphones, at this point I had a few bumps more.

Then I was getting really bored, thinking random things and memories and majority negative...

I had a mild taquicardia and then I put some clothes on because the cold. got a little afraid so ******  .******. I started to get like a small panic atack, I ran to the fridge to pick up a beer for chill out and ran to the outside.

I started to thing other people and saw shadow people, my walk had wierd coordinations, I was like walking on circles looking back, feeling overwhelmed, thinking hard that I get another substances from my dealer, and becoming to worry that like this binge is bad idea.

Half and hour later, with the walk and the beer a was chilling out. But I was thinking very deeply at lives and so on, I had more visuals than ever, lights morphing, other like seeing in fotograms, sound hallucinating a litter bit..lol

Then back home, drank 2 o 3 more beer and fall asleep more relaxed...


But today I wake up more motivadet and stimulated, feeling realy good, like I learned something.

About a year ago, I acquired some MXE through a fairly reliable source. I had been reading these threads and became extremely interested in experiencing this compound. I tried 25 mg orally and then settled in to watch a movie. The experience was very disappointing and essentially felt like being drunk without any euphoria. It mostly felt disorienting. So I shelved the compound and decided I didn't like it. I couldn't understand why there was so much fuss about it. 


Last week after a couple of beers I went to bed and found a second dose of 25 mg MXE that I had left in my nightstand. I impulsively popped it and pulled up the covers. Same stuff from the same stash. 45 minutes later I was in a blissful state of reflection. I could not believe the same compound could produce such different results. I was clearly not holing but it left me wanting for more.  Some things that had been stressing me out were suddenly in perfect perspective and there was some very pleasing, somewhat dreamlike imagery.


Is it common to have such vastly differing experiences when starting out? I will only use this compound lying down in the dark now. 50 mg measured out and very excited to explore further. Wish me luck!

My first experience was pretty glorious, but the few times I tried it after that it felt uncomfortable and like you said, kind of drunk without the euphoria.  Then one night I tried it at a higher dosage in the perfect setting and it was magical, and it remained that way for quite some time.  I used it 2-3 times per week for a few months and after that it's never been as good.

vortech - I was just being brutally honest to try to help you realize that you most likely have a problem on your hands your not realizing. You really think its not a problem to spend 10 hours a day writing a book about MXE? About altered states of consciouness and tuning your brain and what not? Sober up for a while and I bet you will realize that you were pretty delusional. Look I know im coming off as an asshole. I'm pretty damn certain there is no way you wrote such a long book about MXE without just rambling on about bullshit dissociative induced delusions. Since no one else had the balls to say it, I will


ecstacylover - your hating on me because your defending your addiction to this stuff. you admitted couple months ago that you really wanted to stop and now your still here trying to justify your use. I don't remember exactly what your opinion was on the meta-programming/tuning stuff people were posted but I think you were buying into it. This chemical may work as an rapid antidepressant, but its not going to help you if your doing it all the time. Certainly not going to metaprogram yourself into a better person or benefit long term. You will just develop an addiction and create delusions.


Someone named meowfish or explained his use of MXE a while back. Hes used a lot. He was pretty clear in his opinion that it has helped his get over other drug addictions. I don't think hes wrong in saying that, he probably was helped by MXE. However hes probably still using. If he was serious and wanted to quit while he was up he would stop. He may of quit more harmful drugs, but hes now just dependent on something else. I think he may of ceased use or cut back though, so good for him though. I mean no disrespect just giving my opinion on other people's posts.


As I said I don't mean disrepect. I mean to give my opinion and hopefully give you my advice which you can interpret in whatever way you like. I'm not better or smarter than anyone else.


Peace

I just don't see why your saying everyone's an addict like you know them. That's kinda delusional and narcissistic... You don't know me and you don't know them. You only know what you've read. Yeah some people are out there but that's them. Shit if you put some MXE in front of me I'd surely put in into my muscle but I don't have too. I may have probably blown through 50 or more grams of MXE over about five or so years(may be less, who knows!) but I haven't done any in months. I'll probably gran some more sometime but I may not. IDK, but you seem too, so I guess I should probably follow your lead master!![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png) I think this last post was defintely better but you shouldn't go around telling people their addicts or delusional just because your not like them, that's messed up, and not very nice!

Plus, many of us have no problem regulating our use. 8)


It just so happens that a lot of daily users post in here about their experiences. That doesn't mean all of us use that often. I use on average once every two weeks, and I haven't encountered any issues with doing so.

Help!? - I never said anything towards you


I said a handful of people have addictions on this thread and they should realize it. The two people that attacked my post that I called out have been on these threads forever posting about how often they use and how its helping them ect. They are giving other people bad advice by saying its helpful. Even though I bet only a few dozen people even read their posts. Its really a waste of my time to even bother posting here and maybe I shouldn't of in the first place.


I remember when Vaya posted a long time ago about how MXE affected him/her really negatively. That was during the time I was starting to enjoy them. I wish I took his/her post seriously at the time instead of continuing to use.


If you can do dissociatives twice a week..good for you. I feel most people who have it around and actually enjoy it will not. I bet most people here use a lot more often than that or have at some point. Help!? if you been through 50g mxe, then I think you've probly had an addiction as well. I mean if you guys really like these substances and think they are not prone to abuse, then maybe you should recommend chipping opiates to others. Hell, go write a book about it for 10 hours a day and how much better its made your life.

If I'm spreading bullshit, then just don't take it seriously. Trust me I don't take your posts seriously. I don't plan on metaprogramming or tuning myself anytime soon. LMAO

so what , you just sober up and suddenly you figure it all out? cause i haven't touched mxe in two weeks. went through 10 gs in a month , dropped it cold turkey. getting more really hasnt even really crossed my mind, i dont have to have it, but best believe when i decide to get more im gonna enjoy it.


 i had some problems awhile back but looking back i cant really attribute them to mxe. i was really down in the dumps about life and i was using mxe to escape it. if it wasnt mxe, it wouldve been alcohol or weed or something else. 'buying' into the tuning stuff? its not something you buy into. its out there yanno, you can go experience it yourself and decide for yourself. for me, my experience with mxe has been really similar to what vortech describes.


in case you haven't realized yet pretty much everyone is addicted to something (alcohol, weed, heroin, meth, videogames, sex, porn, working, religion, etc. ) -- that's called life. if there weren't things out there good enough to be addicting then life would be boring as shit.

It's all good, DatColoredPersonJ, I just wanted to point out that you know, you can't truly speak for other people... I'm picking up what your putting down though. In moderation dissociatives aren't that bad. I like your enthusiasm and respect your want to Help?!? other people but just do it in a less jarring way, ya know? Like share your experience and tell people about how you thought you saw some light but then the darkness consumed you, provide warnings but just don't put words into other people's mouths! Like your trying to say because I may have used fifty grams over six or so years that I'm an addict? Well do the math bra. I like high doses and rarely do less than 80mgs at a time, it may not have started out like that, but with ketamine, and the exception of stronger ones like 3-MeO-PCP, I go deep! I dose high and combo, does that make me an addict? Who's to say but me, and most certainly not you because your not me, and you don't know me or my story, so don't tread on me like that... Is all I'm saying..! I mean mathematically, fifty grams over six years isn't that insane the way I was dosing. Doing an average of one hundred mgs per experience, it really doesn't equate to that much extravaganzce. It's like all I'm saying is look at the big picture and don't trap yourself in an arrogant box mang. That isn't what the expansion of psychedelics is about, but it can be when you get egotistical and manic about it... Take it easy man, and I'm glad to see you came through to the other side better!![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif)

Good points both of you made. Help!? I've also probably used a good 50+ up to 100gs myself of the stuff. I did like combos and high dosing too. I considered myself addicted to be using so much but I guess thats just my definition. Didn't mean to come off as an egotistical maniac in my first posts thats why i came back and tried to kind of clarify. Reformed drug addicts like me are quite annoying at times I admit.

I wasn't necessarily trying to be confrontational with you man, but I gotta stand up for my beliefs. So I guess in this case, agree to disagree? ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Respect your opinions ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png). Also know exactly where your coming from. I mostly based my opinions 2 days ago based on my 3-meo-pcp experience. I had such high hopes and I ended up staying up for like 24 hours on it not knowing how to sleep, dosing high and just losing it. I literally didn't know how to do anything and I was just stuck in a felt like never ending paranoid state. It may of cost me $100 in 3-meo-pcp flushing it which I could of easily got my money back from from giving it to someone else, but I think it was a positive learning experience. I can now reflect that dissociatives are a no no for me. It kind of reminded me how I used to feel when I felt down on MXE. 3-meo and MXE are different but I'd say this blank never ending paranoid state of mind that I had was pretty similar to how I felt sometimes on MXE. I used to be addicted to high doses though so most people who use responsiblity probably wouldnt experience this. I kind of regretted flushing it and wasting my money, but I felt it was the best thing to do. I don't want to pass off any problems to other people or possibly set myself up for any more problems in the future. I probably could of enjoyed the chemical if I used it correctly and didn't go overboard. Personally, I think I'll be better off without that risk though.

Let's get back to simple MXE talk how about guys %)


So, recently when I went to Ren Fest, I wore sandles all weekend and my feet got pretty nasty. When I came back from the fest, I was feeling bummed it was over and after some relaxation decided to dose some MXE that night. I experienced a phenomena I have only seen with MXE, where my feet still felt like I was wearing my dirty ass sandles for the whole trip, until I'd look down and realize I was finally barefoot... then minutes later, I'd feel like I had my dirty sandles on again. Has anyone experienced this 'phantom object' phenomenon before? I found it quite intriguing.

Hey, some people like to watch tv 10 hors a day. some people like to shop 10 horurs a day. some people watch porn 10 hours a day. i think vortech is doing something creative and having a good time. I never feel like i had addiction to mxe myself but i know what real addiction is because of opiates. i never crossed the line into immoral behavior fer even heroin but everyone is different. I think mxe and dissociatives in general opened my eyes and to look at the bigger pic.


Feel like i am a single cell and part of a larger organism that is the universe we all live in.people who are nuts before they find drugs will always blame the drugs as will society but only you know yourself. Blessings to alll...

Stored away a sample of MXE for about 2 years. When I finally tried it, it just felt drunk but without the fun parts, and my head felt heavy.

Considering getting more, but is the quality the same as it was 3 years ago?

^If you can even find it... probably not. I doubt your sample degraded though. MXE can just be funny like that. I'd say 1 out of 7 or so trips on MXE is off for me.

Hard to say. If you have no tolerance, MXE should be confusing but certainly more fun than alcohol intoxication. Perhaps I'm just speaking for the subset of the population that tend towards dissociatives though. Have you any prior MXE experience to this sample? It's entirely possible you have diphenidine or another dissociative, Im of the opinion that given quality MXE, the reaction you describe is somewhat unlikely. If you're sure you can get real MXE, I say go for it. At worst, you realize that MXE isn't for you.

Ah thanks for the link vortech !!


definetly checking it out in the train to amsterdam next tuesday ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


BTW, I feel it is only in the MXE thread that there's a lot of hate, not towards the substance per se, but towards the people using it. More so than in other threads definetly. Comon folks ease up !

What does your liver have to do with anything? I doubt MXE has much hepatoxcity to it... Also I'll still blast high doses like that without a tolerance, there's crazy MF'ers like me out there who just love diving deep into the ethers. Sometimes I'll dose intermittently depending on how much I have or what's going on, but sometimes it's awesome to just blast 125mgs into my thigh and then vale some hash with good headphones on, and melt into my recliner!![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

Something has to filter it from your body, so it's either your liver or your kidneys

Yeah well for MXE I believe it's more the kidneys. Either way though simply because something has to be excreted doesn't make it a problem for that system. There has to be somewhat specfic things to make it become to heavy a load and veere into toxicity. Also putting multiple things that use the same metabolic pathway can heighten the strain... Our bodies for the most part are fairly effcient when it comes to that.


Edit: It can also be complicated by the fact that the liver may metabolize a substance but it may also be excreted through the kidneys...

I never questioned toxicity, but rather the strain of metabolizing large quantities of unresearched chemicals (and with unknown purity ....jah  only knows what the Chinese labs are using as equipment ;heavy metals etc.....)


Although seeing as ketamine is used at a pretty big dose is surgical settings I'd assume it's fairly safe....but all the time.....hard to say

Took a decent dose yesterday, i notice that it is still subtly lingering, especially the morning after. The dose was at 9pm the night before, when i woke up i felt higher than i did the at any time the night before. The effects quite visual in the morning, however not at all the night before. It was funny sitting in morning classes like that. Really long lasting afterglow with this stuff, it's niceeeee

Nice Vortech, I plan on giving your book a read here soon ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


The recent shortage of MXE everyone has been talking about has me worried. I still have about half a gram left over from a stash that I had thought I had lost but just recently found. I know that it has been banned in Europe and China, but are there not chemists in the United States capable of manufacturing such an amazing chemical? Why the sudden lack thereof?


It really is a crime against humanity that such things are made illegal by the government. I feel rushed to buy more from my vendor before it dissapears.

I was unaware of the recent ban in China (don't keep up) and was gifted some "MXE" over the weekend.  Considering the source it was coming from I assumed it was going to be legit.  He hadn't tried it himself before coming over and thankfully I only took a small bump since it'd been over a year since I had any.


Whatever it was it wasn't MXE, I knew it wasn't soon as I snorted it.  It burned and stung my nose, and combined with a small dab sent me into instant panic.  I had to ride it out for 20-30 minutes before the panic stopped and I felt somewhat normal.  I felt _very_ dissociated for about an hour when suddenly it just wore off and I felt totally sober again.


I know most of you use vendors so maybe this won't be a problem for you but I was told this came from a vendor that had been good for the last two-three years. Trying to talk my buddy into sending some off to see exactly what it is.


Be careful out there guys.

Is it normal to feel mentally impaired the day after dosing MXE ? Yesterday I took some and this morning was still feeling a little bit dissociated when I closed my eyes, that's twelve hours after dosing. It's the afternoon and I still feel a mental "fog". 


I've been playing with this compound for the last month but I don't think I get it. I haven't experienced any kind of euphoria from low dosages, just a plain mental blankness which I don't really enjoy. I understand it can feel "anti-depressive" if you want your mind to just shut up, but I don't think that's the same as "euphoria". Mental numbness is the opposite of what I seek in a drug experience. 


So I though that maybe if that didn't do it for me, I would up the dose and aim for a more "Psychedelic" experience, which is what got me interested in this in the first place. Well, I can say it was sort of interesting, and somewhat fun, but far from insightful as most people make it out to be. I mean it was as insightful as extreme delusion can be. I spent most of the experience eyes closed, as light seemed to disgust me slightly. I hoped to see the vivid memory mental replay some people rave about, but all I felt a weird sensation of falling indefinitely in tunnel made of cubic rooms. It was amusing, kind of. But I don't think I have taken anything useful from it. When I tried to contemplate my life, everything seemed blurry and distant, not in the way of impossible to recall like on a psychedelic ego death, but more like everything seemed devoid of meaning. I felt a little bit hopeless, actually, but no insight was found, as I couldn't actually think properly. It was very confusing. Not sure what I think about MXE.

What you experienced is pretty common. A lot of people don't like MXE/dissociatives. Blank and little euphoria is spot on. I've had a mix of great times and that blank feeling. I mostly enjoyed it for the numbing that is gives. Some people are crazy about it but don't expect to love it as much as them, it probably will never happen.

My early MXE experiences were like you described (well except my first was amazing).  Then one day I had a really magical-feeling experience and from then on it affected me that way.  I always thought that was strange.

Yeah, I don't have any experience with other dissociatives, but I thought I would give MXE a try before it disappeared, as most people think so highly of it. Maybe it's just not a world for me to explore ![(:](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) 


I'm still intrigued by it though, so maybe I'll revisit it latter. Maybe some day I'll get a magical experience like yours, Xorkoth !

Perhaps. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  Also it's a really great addition to combos with other psychedelics, especially tryptamines.  I really only use it for that anymore because after a while the magic seemed to disappear for me with MXE on its own.

Someone please help me with my harm reduction.I have used MXE for depression and opiate addiction before and it worked like a charm,even as good as Ibogaine,if not better as it didn`t have all the associated risks.

Unfortunately i have fallen foul of Opiates again and am depressed,so i`m really asking if anyone can help? PM me if you can,thanks in advance...Also im in the UK,i hope this doesn`t go against the rules,not sort of something my doctor would understand.

So I just recently got clean coming off of a two year run with the dreaded benzodiapines. Even with a slow four week Librium taper, the withdrawal was hell. It has been a little more then two months, and I am still currently experiencing post acute withdrawal symptoms such as general anxiety and OCD. The last two days I have taken low doses of MXE, 25-50 mgs throughout the day, and can honestly say it has helped immensely!


Today I have not taken any MXE at all, and I am still feeling pretty good. I have heard of others reporting positive results when using MXE to combat withdrawal symptoms and cravings, and must say I am amazed at how much this has seemed to help. I have never experienced the addictive qualities of MXE, which is interesting to me because I have an extremely addictive personality. Just thought I would share my experience and see if anyone else had anything they can relate ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

My friend popped positive for PCP the other day on a drug test for his work. He has never done PCP in his life, but him and I have been regularly doing MXE for quite some time now. Is it possible the MXE gave him a false positive for PCP? I wouldn't think so when really taking into account the chemical structure...but I guess it is possible?

^I've read about others also testing positive for PCP from MXE use, so MXE is most likely the culprit. That sucks for him though, did he lose his job?

He denied using any drugs and was really upset, so the company decided to send the test in to a lab for further testing to confirm whether or not it was actually PCP. Apparently there are a lot of things that can trigger false positives for PCP including benadryl and Lamotrigine, which he actually has a prescription for. Hopefully all goes well for him, I'll report back with the results.

I agree with the ones commenting on the anti-addictive properties of mxe. When I quitted opiates after a 7 years adiction stint i was feeling, of course, awful, with absolutely no energy to do anything... I knew i had to be as active as possible, do exercise, etc. and if were not because i snorted some mxe in the mornings i wouldn't have been able to do it. It really made the day bearable, which makes all the difference in that situation

I have added a section to my book about biorhythms. I found a biorhythm calculator online, all you need to do is input your birthdate to see current, future, and past levels. What do you all think of this? I quote from my book:

"Biorhythms are an important concept in tuning, and[this calculator](http://www.facade.com/biorhythm/) could be valuable reference data when doing tuning work to help balance primary/secondary levels as needed. 

 ‘The three primary biorhythm cycles are:

Emotional: This cycle tracks the stability and positive energy of your psyche and outlook on life, as well as your capacity to empathize with and build rapport with other people.

Intellectual: This cycle tracks your verbal, mathematical, symbolic, and creative abilities, as well as your capacity to apply reason and analysis to the world around you.

Physical: This cycle tracks your strength, health, and raw physical vitality.

      The three secondary cycles that derive from the primaries are:

Mastery: This is the composite of the Intellectual and Physical cycles. Mastery encompasses your ability to succeed at tasks and to obtain what you desire. This cycle also tracks athletic ability and the focus required to learn physical skills.

Passion: This is the composite of the Physical and Emotional cycles. Passion encompasses your motivation to act, and the drive that allows you to continue a difficult pursuit. This cycle also tracks sexuality in its purest form.

Wisdom: This is the composite of the Emotional and Intellectual cycles. Wisdom encompasses your understanding of the world, your role in it, and the things that are truly important to your life. This cycle also tracks the presence of mind that you need to make crucial decisions.’ [http://www.facade.com/biorhythm/](http://www.facade.com/biorhythm/)


Emotional levels correspond to the spirit, intellectual levels correspond to the mind, and the physical level correspond to the body, thus giving a complete picture of the mind-body-spirit cycles. MXE and other tuning tools may be used when biorhythms are at their extremes to assist in reigning in the levels to a more stable consistency when needed.  For instance, when the emotional and physical levels align at the extreme low end, MXE could help bring the levels up to baseline.

That just makes me Sad. Especially given the fact that it's such an exotic Compound now. I still FULLY believe that it will be back, and in force - it will just take time. Too Many People have said - This is my Favorite DOC, or the most Fun, it's just so fucking versatile. It's' a fun dancing night at a show - and at the same time, it's a mellow night at Home Exploring the Inner Workings of what the FUCK makes up a Human Being, or you can travel the inner working of your own mind and Introspectively and Intelligently form very Lucid and Original Concepts, Philosophies - The Depths that you have a Chance to get to Know Yourself On are just AMAZING on MXE, and to Me, are UNMATCHED by LSD, Mushrooms, almost any other " Traditional Psychedelic " OTHER THAN DMT. That is the only one that I feel holds the same Power as a Tool to travel the Mind and actually Bring Back USEFUL Information and Insights. MXE needs Respect - but it's so hard when the Brain is so fucking Fascinating.


Sometimes with MXE, that first Dip back into Arylcyclohexylamine Land may be kind of jarring, or dysphoric......a bumpy ride so to say - whereas when you're using MXE daily and are in a Binge, or a Habit - You pretty much have to Plan on taking a Larger Dose to reach that wild, out there, almost M-Holing, but not quite zone that is Oh, so Peaceful and Wonderful. I've been punched in the face by a 50mg bump of Top Shelf MXE many, many times - I always forget to add in Tolerance after a Week or Two break.........But at the same time, Dissociative / MXE Tolerance are just weird in general. I find my Tolerance to be Permanent to a large extent - but I can still get High and out into the M-Hole just fine - it just takes one Heavy Dose either Oral or Intranasal - or 2-3 Staggered Doses, which some prefer as you tend to more slowly make your way to the Deeper End of the Compound. I've even had different experiences during the same day, with the SAME BATCH of MXE I had done 10-12 Hours Earlier.


When the MXE comes back around - Let's show it the Appreciation it Deserved all along, and STOCKPILE and use for Special Occasions, or for Suddenly Occurring Situations that require a very DEEP amount of Empathetic, Lucid, Loving Thought - while at the same time being Rational about the Real Life Effects of what you're thinking about doing. MXE has saved my ASS on a Number of Occasions when someone fucked up - and needed to be put in their place for what they had done - but instead of Violence, a Compelling, Outsiders Perspective of the Situation begins to take place. MXE just makes me want to be at Peace Always with the people in my Life that I care about the Most - Realizing and always looking for the bigger picture instead of being content with limits.


I feel like MXE is the Drug NZT on Limitless - and I think more than just me has seen the movie and the TV Show. It's a pretty damn good representation - while quite exaggerated still - of the things that MXE can INSPIRE You to do, or help you learn faster. I swear that after 5 years of MXE use - I know Myself, My Mind, and My Body on a MUCH Deeper Level than I ever have in my life - and I haven't had MXE in over a Month, maybe longer. The holes in our Society that you see, the Injustice that we as a Species allow to happen - those deeper pictures of the Darker Edge of our Planet that is in Reality, the Dark Side of Our Society. My final MXE Conclusion - No matter how amazing the brain, talented the person - restrained and disciplined the person may be................at the end of the day, in the right or wrong circumstance - there is still a TON of PRIMAL Rage, Aggression, Survival Instincts built into our brain that we don't even realize. 


At the End of the Day - We're all just a bunch of Hedonistic Animals, with a fucking AMAZINGLY Beyond a Super Computer for a Brain. Pretty fucking crazy, but at the end of 5 years, watching my relationships of all varieties, trying to have a stable life, juggling all the bullshit, pointless things that life throws at us - when pushed to the point, We Will Protect Our Pack, Our Kind, Our Family, Our Friends. It made me realize how much I've never had a Family and why I don't understand so much of the world around me. MXE will come back somehow I hope - but if not - it still did me a favor I never could've done for myself.......Help me see Life for what it really is, and start to actually appreciate it a little.

I read about so many people flushing mxe, I just don't get. This is a drug that I have always had around, and have had zero problems controlling, even though I have such an addictive personality. I am about to purchase more. It is something that I have always had around, and hope to have for the years to come.

It usually gets flushed when a user takes too much and is unable to function and realizes that the shit is going to be bad for them. They have the realization that they don't ever want to be in that state again. I remember I got so mrocked I couldn't even remember my name for a couple minutes, then proceeded to flush the rest. Its a tool that can be used beneficially, but is also dangerous.

Well, it's certainly a fun drug...


I think I enjoy doing it because of the way I experience music on it. And it gives me some sort of weird nostalgic response every time. It's a strange thing.

Meowfish, I had the same thought when watching the Limitless show the other day. Thanks for highlighting the need to respect it, as with all the arycyclohexylamines, or any tuning tool for that matter. There is a time and a place for their utility, and should not be used without good intention.

What ma nikka Mr. Meowfish said


I wouldn't have relapsed on IV heroin/cocaine and had to get back on a buprenorphine script if MXE had been accessible. It was truly the best AD I've ever had the privilege of taking. Nothing quite like a few lines or a IV shot of S-isomer, white, crystalline MXE.

80 mg one day a week, alternating it with poppies or kava, allows me to hole and tells me all I need to know to keep improving my life. It seems like our brains are prone to inertia, they make connections but then those connections tend to petrified, and mxe is a kind of neural softener, giving back its elasticity and capacity to think without the constrains of accumulated mental inertia

I flushed at least two lots,probably 5 grams in total,i still find myself searching for it,as if i may have made a stash somewhere when i was out of it,i haven`t been this bad since i used crack years back when i used to comb the floor looking for crumbs,even smoking dried bread crumbs knowing what they were,but the compulsion so bad i just had to do it.


MXE is the most incredible drug i`ve ever used and will say that whoever flushes their gear will regret it 100%.I just can`t believe that this gem has gone,i would have thought that the streets would be awash with it from the underground labs.


If its so moreish,which it is,then why isn`t it around,maybe it was a niche market.I had friends saying it was the best drug they had ever had and these are old school veterans.

I also flushed 2g of mxe because of my girlfriend (she didnt want me to do any drugs). Now she is my ex girlfriend and I totally regret it. Especially since its banned in europe. I cant believe that i was so stupid and honest.


Edit: I'm really fucking pissed because i loved mxe. Even though i really have an addictive personality i never had a problem with mxe. And never being able to m-hole again is kinda sad.

My ex-wife made me flush my entire stash... this was before the days of MXE but I lost a bunch of 2C-B, DOM, some other true rarities, and a whole bunch of different 2C-Xs and tryptamines, plus DMT, 250x salvia extract, and I forget what else.  Sucks, huh?

A few years ago I flushed a few grams of the original UK stuff after feeling like I was abusing. Never found another batch that good. Oh yes, there is regret.


Just imagining all that flushed MXE... What do you think, 1000s of grams?

I wanted to flush mine the other day... glad I didn't in the end but I really must draw a line with this stuff. I got a gram a month ago and I've been going through the baggie like a vacuum cleaner. It's my first ever dissociative and it feels so much easier to abuse than most of the psychedelics, I've been using it daily for the last couple of weeks. At the low doses (15-30mg insufflated, up to 60 mg in the course of an evening) I've been taking it's just pretty darn recreational, and I feel I feel I respect the drug much less than I do say, tryptamines. (for all this I'm to blame of course & not the drug)


All the while I still feel compelled to ask what MXE does? Because I can't lay a finger on it. I feel there should be so much more in this stuff but at the moment I don't see it. It feels good, but what do I take home from it?

Yeah my idea is now to save the rest for more serious experimentation in the future. I was trying it out to get a feel for it and that got a bit out of hand. I haven't used it yesterday and I won't today or tomorrow, or the day after that. When I return to my MXE I'll follow your advise and plug, that seems like a good ROA.

it takes a while to realise daily consumption *really* diminishes mxe effects, the best bits are lost.  And worse, forgotten. It becomes another stimulant. Yes, a good quality stimulant, euphoric and not much paranoid prone, but mxe can be so much more. Using it like that it is a bit like having an amazing quantum supercomputer from a future alien race... and use it just as a lighter.

Yeah its less confusing. With staggering you can enter the m-hole when laying down with closed eyes. But keep a pretty clear head when you get up.

Does anyone find mxe at higher doses uncomfortable? For me that would be a huge difference when comparing MXE to other dissociatives like DXM or Ketamine. When I hole on K or take a large dose of DXM, it takes me completely out of my body straight into a lucid dream state. 


I have never had that kind of a true out of body experience on MXE. For me MXE acts more like a psychedelic stimulant at higher doses, especially when smoking weed in combination. I dosed about 75 mgs last night laying in my bed watching movies. Feeling pretty good, nothing crazy overwhelming or anything.


I decided to smoke some bud, and took a nice hit, holding it in for about thirty seconds. It was almost as though the bud tapped into the true power of MXE. There was an immense pressure in my head, not painful but there all the same, and I felt as though if I continued just laying there I was going to black out. I began walking around my house in circles trying to regain composure, taking small little steps shuffling about. The pressure just kept getting stronger and stronger, and I remember wishing I had a Xanax to help bring me back a little because I felt like I was in danger of having a seizure. I experienced insane auditory hallucinations, like water being sucked down a drain, mechanical clinks and clangs, ripping and tearing. My face felt as though it was sliding off of my skull and my body was being pulled and pushed from every angle. 


I tried letting go and just enjoying the ride, but it was quite unpleasant for a good hour. I just kept thinking I was in danger of seizing. Then I eventually leveled out a bit and was able to enjoy the rest of the experience immensely. I guess my point is, for me at least, that other dissociatives are much more comfortable at higher doses. They take you away to other worlds leaving you with no choice but to let go.


Can anyone relate? What are your M-holes like compared to say a K-hole?

My one M-hole was utterly blissful, I was laying down with my eyes closed listening to Shpongle and I fell through the music into the oneness.  I was still somewhat aware of my body but it was unimportant.  I felt GOOD, not precisely euphoric but extremely content.  My recall of it was much higher than from ketamine, and it was more psychedelic.  I have felt good on MXE every time I've taken a high dose and laid down by myself with my eyes closed.


However, I've also taken high doses while hanging out with friends and trying to remain in the world, and I have had some REALLY uncomfortable moments.


Also weed in general makes MXE much, much stronger and adds the potential for anxiety.  MXE alone is not really like that for me.

I never did ketamine so i cant compare. But i did alot of dxm in my life which i loved...even in doses up to 1200mg but mxe is definitely the better, more comfortable and more exciting drug.

Like i said staggering doses makes a huge difference.

When i wanted to hole i took an initial sublingual dose around 25 mg and redosed a few times 25 or 30mg via plugging. I layed in my bed with covered eyes and headphones on with a playlist.

I got sensations of my body floating, stretching, twirling, melting and moving.

And I moved through very vivid 3d, hd, imaxish landscapes, buildings, tunnels. Just like it was really happening. And when i opened my eyes and got up i felt pretty clear headed...wonky and dissociated but not overwhelming.

I have had similar blissful times on MXE, always when laying down in the dark, of floating through time and space observing beautiful scenery. I think for me at least, the combination of marijuana and MXE was too overwhelming. Perhaps in smaller doses it could be enjoyed. I also don't smoke like I used to.

I was still somewhat aware of my body but it was unimportant.  I felt GOOD, not precisely euphoric but extremely content.  My recall of it was much higher than from ketamine, and it was more psychedelic.  I have felt good on MXE every time I've taken a high dose and laid down by myself with my eyes closed.

I've had similar experiences and utterly euphoric holes, especially when I've combined with little amount of alcohol and cannabis.

Just curious but how do you know your MXE was S isomer? Sounds like even now there is more in the U.S. than Europe anyway ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png) agree with what you guys are saying, it did feel like a special compound.

Hell of a ride last night on 3 or 4 small bumps of MXE and some edibles, listening to god knows what on Spotify and playing with [this](https://iacopoapps.appspot.com/hopalongwebgl/). Ended up completely convinced that the universe is a simulation, but unsure whether I'd actually want to end the simulation and chance things in the "real" universe outside. Not so sure today.

If this experience was nothing more then a simulation, I do believe a majority of the people on earth would rather continue living this lie then face the truth. As creatures of habit, we tend to stick to things that make us feel comfortable. The idea that reality is not what it seems terrifies them. Like the thought that the God whom which they reflect on may not be real, or that the government does not hold the people's best interests at heart. These thoughts terrify them, because letting go of control can be a scary thing until you finally just do it. Then you realize all things are possible.

Happens to the best of us, but this truly is the case when MXE is abused daily, what matters is what we take away from our human shortcomings and use them towards net positivity over the long-run.


My personal favorite recipe for a almost guaranteed +3-4, goes.

1. (optional) base layer of 30-50mg orally

2. plug, 30 mg to begin. or, within an hour after the optional oral dose.

3. plug, 30 mg, 1 hours after first plugged dose.

4. plug, 80-100mg 1 hour after second plugged dose.


while this is a recipe for the more advanced researcher , as some of the doses are fairly high, i always found with a baseline tolerance it almost never failed to smoothly transition me into remarkable states of transformation.


seeing how many people talk about flushing theirs, that is truly regrettable, these thoughts came to me so many times when i was blessed with overflowing sacks of mxe and i would allow my physical body to run rampant with dosing. thankfully residual mxe magic in my system coupled with a freshly tuned soul allowed me to steer clear of borderline sacrilege. 'friends' would try to convince to 'just let them hold it for a while' or to let them flush it. never would i allow that to happen. in my mind mxe is priceless, it truly is shameful to see the steps countries have recently taken which lead the human race in the opposite direction of progression. 


and oh god the euphoria. every time. sure, lsd, mdma, or nitrous or cannabis have been joys . even peak states. but nothing is capable of launching me into instant eternal joy like my good friend mexxy. i'm sure she will return, such a beautiful thing cannot be held down, made undesireable, or tamed for long. regardless of what 'laws' dictators may try to enact.


to the outside observer this sounds like simple drug abuse, those people have never truly experienced an experience quite like, so i cannot blame them. i'm sure the contentment of  their blissful ignorance borders on that which i have achieved from my mxe experiences, so i cannot blame them. i can only lead by example. and hope that in time, good will tend to win out more often than bad. i could go the rest of my life without mxe ever again and be perfectly content. i believe that things like mxe must be allowed to run their full course unimpeded to achieve the best results. it has certainly ran its course with me and left me a better human being than i was before, and for that.. i am feel very grateful, blessed , and just lucky to exist in the past, present and future of the space-time fabric.


please dont hold anything i write as truth, i just draw enjoyment from writing about my experiences here. others are fair to draw their own conclusions. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Realizing that I am incredibly unhappy with the way things appear to me at this time. Life comes across being utterly exhausting, filled with nothing but endless amounts of work and struggle. For nothing. And though MXE enlightens, I find myself now completely enveloped in an infinite sadness. Being aware of how things could or should be does nothing to help the cause. It is not in our control. To go on living day in and day out yet having nothing to show for. To know how blank and empty this existence is. Being surrounded by conflicting realities. Empty shell with a plastic smile. Pull-string lines and sought out consequences. Robot slave to society. Death rebirth better life.

^^^ Cosmic, I have been to this hopeless space more often than I care to admit. I can understand how you get there. What you must understand is that this is a beginning; not an end. Your sadness is not without reason, but that reason is informed by an incomplete view. There is more to the story. You'll have to discover what that "more" is for yourself, and in the mean time, you'll have to have some faith that there's something worth living for; worth trying for. Having faith is difficult for rational/skeptical people like myself, but ultimately we must surrender to the full journey. It is as mysterious as it is horrible. Though you say, "it is not in our control," what you really mean is that you are finite and conditions are not as you would wish. Use your power where you have it, and be mindful of the rest.


Came across this letter from Nicole Krauss to Vincent van Gogh the other day. Might be of interest:

I can relate to this Cosmic Giraffe. Nobody can protect that innocence forever. It's no different than falling in love. You want to hold on to it and never to let go, but eventually life won't let you hold on forever to something outside yourself. On one level you needed someone to come along and show you that you were capable of such love. On the other hand life won't let you confuse the source of that love. In a sense you're experiencing the age old question "Is it better to have loved and lost, than never loved at all?" My answer is yes but with the added lesson, be clear about the source of that love. That love is your being experiencing itself. That love is your being experiencing creation which is yourself. I'm sure you've heard it all before and seen it with your own eyes but do you believe it? Do you trust it? Have you integrated it so that it's stable? What always was can never be lost. Ultimately we surrender so we can just be it. Don't think you already know the outcome of this journey. It may have been disillusionment more times that than you care to admit, but only because there was an illusion there. Find out what that illusion is that keeps disillusioning you and keep going. Eventually you trust the process and it becomes fun again.

Nicole Krauss had it right, and Vincent knew it too. There´s not way anyone or anything will save you, you have to give it birth yourself, even more accurately, you have to give birth to a new yourself. It is about forcing yourself to be an author rather than an actor following someone else´s lines. Too much tripping can end in a formless life, it is up to you to shape it up

**Ecclesiasties 1:1-18**


**Everything Is Meaningless**


**1** The words of the Teacher, son of David, king in Jerusalem: **2** "Meaningless! Meaningless!" says the Teacher. "Utterly meaningless! Everything is meaningless." **3** What does man gain from all his labor at which he toils under the sun? **4** Generations come and generations go, but the earth remains forever. **5** The sun rises and the sun sets, and hurries back to where it rises. **6** The wind blows to the south and turns to the north; round and round it goes, ever returning on its course. **7** All streams flow into the sea, yet the sea is never full. To the place the streams come from, there they return again. **8** All things are wearisome, more than one can say. The eye never has enough of seeing, nor the ear its fill of hearing. **9** What has been will be again, what has been done will be done again; there is nothing new under the sun. **10** Is there anything of which one can say, "Look! This is something new"? It was here already, long ago; it was here before our time. **11** There is no remembrance of men of old, and even those who are yet to come will not be remembered by those who follow.


**Wisdom Is Meaningless**


**12** I, the Teacher, was king over Israel in Jerusalem. **13** I devoted myself to study and to explore by wisdom all that is done under heaven. What a heavy burden God has laid on men! **14** I have seen all the things that are done under the sun; all of them are meaningless, a chasing after the wind. **15** What is twisted cannot be straightened; what is lacking cannot be counted. **16** I thought to myself, "Look, I have grown and increased in wisdom more than anyone who has ruled over Jerusalem before me; I have experienced much of wisdom and knowledge." **17** Then I applied myself to the understanding of wisdom, and also of madness and folly, but I learned that this, too, is a chasing after the wind. **18** For with much wisdom comes much sorrow; the more knowledge, the more grief.

Today I read Revelations. If there was ever a time, it is now. A fire from the heavens? I would not be surprised if ISIS had control of some sort of EM microwave weapon that could target people based on hacking cell networks through triangulation. Yeah, crazy shit, but food for thought, and the technology exists.

I am not much into the bible myself. When I was younger I read the entire thing, but now that I have been through a lot more in the time that has since passed, I realize reading those verses that there was a lot of content in it that back then I did not fully understand. I am not religious, but there are so many good lessons in the bible, some open to interpretation but others plain as day. I can relate to it very much if I am being honest.


Thanks everyone, your responses have truly inspired me, and I am overwhelmed by the support. Thank you all so much. Good to know that I have thoughts other people can relate to.

Agreed, further discussion, head to the Social, but I have one more message for you Pharmakos; is your name derived from Pharmako/Poeia by Dale Pendell? The book was recently given to me by a astrological spirit brother in divine synchronicity; we have many revelations to share between us. Lastly, thank you for the message of Ecclesiastes. It is on my reading list today and is already speaking directly.

A person can reguritate wise words at the right time or even fathom their own seeming to gleam as a king, but the real question is....does that make them truly wise or just coy to the moment? Words may guide you for a time but only true reality will carry your weight the rest of the way.... Realizing this can crush you, or mold you into something greater, as your will, will always be the true master guiding the reins...

Most definitely. The power in words is not what they hold for the speakers, but those that receive the message. Coming up with or regurgitating the right words at the right time is an expression of the infinite, an interjection of oneness meant to bring light to those who are hearing it.

> 			I can relate to this Cosmic Giraffe. Nobody can protect that innocence forever. It's no different than falling in love. You want to hold on to it and never to let go, but eventually life won't let you hold on forever to something outside yourself. On one level you needed someone to come along and show you that you were capable of such love. On the other hand life won't let you confuse the source of that love. In a sense you're experiencing the age old question "Is it better to have loved and lost, than never loved at all?" My answer is yes but with the added lesson, be clear about the source of that love. That love is your being experiencing itself. That love is your being experiencing creation which is yourself. I'm sure you've heard it all before and seen it with your own eyes but do you believe it? Do you trust it? Have you integrated it so that it's stable? What always was can never be lost. Ultimately we surrender so we can just be it. Don't think you already know the outcome of this journey. It may have been disillusionment more times that than you care to admit, but only because there was an illusion there. Find out what that illusion is that keeps disillusioning you and keep going. Eventually you trust the process and it becomes fun again.

so many skeptics... at the end of the day we are all more or less equally ignorant of what lies beyond the veil, such is to be human. of course we can resign ourselves to wallow in despair. but faith seems to be much more fun and fulfilling, even if it is ultimately futile.


id be lying if i said i wasnt a cynical narcissist by nature, but lifes way more enjoyable when you allow yourself to hope for better. mdma/mxe/lsd/dmt i thank thee, for allowing me to bypass my logical nature and submit myself to the cosmic dance.

Logic will be the only light that guides this ship to shore. I have no time for nuisance or nonesense. Wisdom is a kingdom frought with infidelity, doubt, and arrogance. None will help you. You'll only drawn to the rocks hidden in the shadows.... It's also something to be given in spades but not everyone is worthy and most unfortunately this is life. Dog eats dog. Were simply predators prowling for the next score, whatever that may be for any given person. Things like this are always multi sided though. The meek think this is sad while others see it as simple fact. Nothing to be sad about but something that can maybe be changed but not really. Their are just certain facts that are steel in this world, they don't really change but can always be reformatted. It's all pervasive anyways, a fleeting sort of thing. One mans knowledge and another's madness, this is a strange rule in life. Fall to far and your simply a madman, but pulling the chute at the right time is really what it's all about...

Ugh. The one and only vendor still selling MXE that I know of now requires that all members get an official affadavit signed and notarized stating that you are who you say you are and understand all his rules in regards to such chemicals before he will sell anything to you. I really don't want to do it as I know the notary may think it is very odd and might have some questions, ones that I really don't feel like answering.


What choice is there though, I want to purchase more before it is possibly gone for good. Just did my last 50 milligrams last night ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)

I think the chances of it being gone for good are slim to none... it's so popular, and illegality doesn't stop other popular things.  We're just in an adjustment period now, the law just passed, it's a hot ticket item, it's probably being watched carefully.  Once things die down it will show up again, I'm almost sure of it.  Never like it was before, but it will be produced.

It is really very easy to become a notary. Read a small handbook to learn the rules, pay a fee to the government ($30-$50), buy a stamp, and done. Your friend and yourself could become notaries and notarize one another's affidavit's. If I knew you then I would be happy to do it for you. I think that freedom of religion is a very valid cause and I would fully support your endeavor. Paranoia keeps the government from destroying ya.

I'm sure this is off topic, but just to be clear "Notary" means different things in different countries. I think what you're talking about is a "Notary public." In some countries, notaries must be lawyers, so yea, not as easy to become one just like that. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I appreciate you sharing that bit of knowledge with me Listening. Words are important and it is always good to be aware of conflicting definitions so as to be very precise with their use. I indeed did intend to refer to a Notary Public.

Kind of an anachronistic question at this point, but how does one goe about mixing this one with tryptamines ? Do you dose the MXE after the come up, of pre-load with it and then drop the tryptamine ? How does the added dissociation affect the trip ? Never mixed psychedelics and dissociatives before.

I like the take them at the same time.  Or the MXE before.  If I take them at the same time they start to come up at the same time, or the MXE a little before.  The main is I find it's more effective if the MXE is simultaneous or earlier than the tryptamine.  Actually in general MXE combinations are more effective for me if I am on MXE first or at the same time.

I would generally take the MXE first and 15-30 minutes later take the tryptamine.   It depends on the substance of course but I was mainly trying to avoid the pre-trip anxiety or was mainly using the tryptamine to drive the CEVs.   If I were shooting for a hole I would wait many hours before taking the tryptamine as I would have been slowly building up to the hole with MXE by taking a dose every hour or so.  When I thought I was close to the hole I would co-administer the tryptamine with my final MXE dose.

 There is some tolerance crossover but IME not complete. I once had a 6 day run of MXE and then switched right over to K for 3 days and was an effective transition.

You really cannot miss a beat when it comes to grabbing the last of the MXE. I'm just so thankful my dissociative problem is under control and I feel comfortable creating a long term personal stockpile. not trying to brag about my collection but its so beautiful


3g of the very psychedelic, racemic powder.

5g of S-isomer.

25g of mxe that is slightly inferior to the batches above.

20g of one of the last batches out of a china lab.

rounding it out i have 3.5 g of racemic K, and more than enough 3-MeO to boot.


Look me in my face, I ain't got no worries. Looking forward to Christmas though, it's been to long since I got properly thrashed. MXE>LSD>MDMA>N2O>DMT>K is my game plan. thank you santa.

Hasn't it been confirmed yet that all mxe that has been circulated has been racemic because it is very hard to isolate the S isomer from mxe?

Been a while since I've been on here. I fucking hate the Holiday's, have no Family or Friends who Celebrate Thanksgiving or Christmas.


I really only wanted to comment on the statement made above about the way that I Choose to type my text on here. I am very Manic, and I type very fast - I'm also a very sensitive and emotional person. Any word which is Uppercase that doesn't need to be - it's like how we speak in real life, putting Emphasis on a Word, Group of Words, or Thought that I feel passionately about, don't want people to miss, or just overall feel is slightly more Important than the other Words they may be surrounded by. I understand your frustration to an extent - I'm actually extremely OCD about people who have no Depth to their Vocabulary, as well as people who can't Spell or don't bother to use Spellcheck at least....


It just bums me out to think that if you're not the only Poster on Bluelight who feels this way - that there could be people missing useful Information about MXE, Dissociatives, Drugs, or just Life as a Junkie LEARNING to Live with and Accept Addiction and everything in between. I don't post for any other reason than to help spread Information I deem Important - that doesn't mean it's something everyone will Value - but I'm Alone in Life, probably for the rest of it, and sometimes the only "Family" I care or think about, are the People on Bluelight, because to me, the Only People that I feel I can ACTUALLY Relate to, are either Drug Addicts, Ex-Addicts, Or People who enjoy Philosophy. outside of that - I am Alone, Partially Chosen, Partially Stolen - but I'm OK with it. Even among people I feel that I relate to the MOST, I still Rarely make a Lasting Connection, in any part of life. I've just chosen to accept that due to the things I've seen, and life I've known - combined with my Mental Health, this may be the best my Life will ever get......................BUT, I'm OK with that. Wherever I am at any given moment is where I'm meant to be, even if it get's Lonely.


 A part of me feels like I should take your advice - but I'm a Stubborn Fuck. I INSIST on Doing, and Living Life in my own way, while still being respectful and as kind as I can possibly be on any given day to Anyone that I come in contact with, in real life or on a message board. Self Expression is a BEAUTIFUL thing - so Sorry to Disappoint.....................but I'm gonna keep doing my thing. I've switched over to 3-MeO for now anyways...........and I don't have as much to say about it as I did MXE. It is what it is. Life keeps moving.


To Dismiss the thoughts of Someone over something so Petty is just Pointless to me.........but being me - It still makes me happy that you're obviously being Yourself just as Much as I am. It makes me Happy to see other people being their TRUE Self instead of Wearing the Masks that Society forces us to put on to protect ourselves. Even if I don't agree with your thinking or thought process - it still makes me Smile when people are actually REAL in a World of Fake Asses, Fake Tits, and Plastic People. Keep doing You, and feel free to dislike or disregard this post - because I'd rather You HATE Me, than be another Fake Ass Fucker. There are PLENTY to go around.....


What's wrong with being a little Manic.....................It's the only time that I actually get to have fun, feel good, and get out of bed without wanting to cry some days. If you were Bi-Polar - You're statement about Mania would be completely different. Some of the most amazing Artists, Musicians, Philosophers and Thinkers of all time dealt with what would nowadays be diagnosed as either Bi-Polar or Schizophrenic, not saying my condition makes me anything special, just making a general statement. 


Feel free to Replace the word I, with the word WE in certain parts of any of my posts. When I refer to myself in my head - I think "WE should do this", not "I should do this". I feel we are all SO Connected - that over the years, I view myself as part of a Bigger Collective, and personally find Ego and Egotistical People to be a HUGE part of why the world we live in is so fucked up so often..........but when I proofread my Posts on BL - I see the word I too much, and it makes me wonder if possibly I have a bigger Ego that I think, even with all of my years of Dissociative Ego Destruction. Anyways, just trying to say - even if you don't like what I Post, it's not from a place of Hate, just a misunderstanding or a a Bad Day. - Peace - Meowfish

Don't worry about the capitalization Meowfish... doesn't bother me.  The thing that bothers me is people that don't use paragraphs or punctuation, only because that is actually hard to read since there are no sentence or thought delimiters, it reads like a long, run-on string of words.  You don't do that though.

Meowfish I took the time to read your post, as I always do when I come across them. I know you don't have much family and friends in your local vicinity, but do know that you have brethren here. I as well have spent time recently with 3meo, nothing bad to say about it TBH, and it adds a nice balance to previous research, but I would love to hear more of your perspective. Don't mind the haters that are turned off to the quality of your word. I myself have been using capital letters to stress important words.

Ecstacylover, man, you have the game on lockdown right now! Your words as well echo mine. I do believe in the S-isomer batch, it is surprising people still doubt its possibility. In your journey the next few weeks, Meowfish you too, if you are called to offer feedback on my book, know it would be highly valued.

Best wishes to Meowfish from me too, I like your way with words. I'm apparently bi-polar and maybe schizophrenic also, not sure still with the doctor. Myself I haven't had any MXE in a year, continuing experiments with 3-MeO at the moment. I do miss MXE but haven't had a source but I don't mind that, I love 3-MeO from all my heart, even if it does make me a bit nuts sometimes.


Hoping to give a proper read to vortech's book too, have been too "busy" and disoriented lately to read anything.


Stay cool, dissohead brothers and sisters. God bless you.

Thanks for the love guys. Sometimes I think about writing a book about my life, mainly the first 18 years of being part of a CREEPY Religion - raised a Jehovah's Witness against my will. Parents told me when I was 7-8 years old, when I asked them about the Future - specifically my own......I remember because even then I was worried about what it would be like being 18 and living on my own, as that was the only way I felt that I would ever be free from their forced beliefs. My Mom told me when I asked her what I would do to take care of myself and get a job by the time I was 18, Her Reply....... "The Apocalypse would've already started Meowfish, all of the bad "Worldy" people who are not Jehovah's Witness's, God will wipe all of them off the Earth by then and we'll get to Live Forever in Paradise on the Earth, don't worry about those things for now, you'll be safe as long as you do as we say". This statement haunted me for years to come. 


I'm only making this little post so people Understand a little about where my Views and Thoughts come from. If I took the time to talk about all of the SKETCHY inner working of that Religion, that people outside of it are NOT AT ALL aware of - you guys would be scared as fuck of what these people believe. They're as SCARY as something like ISIS to me - they're THAT Militant about what they believe, they're just non-violent - but they are just as big of Doomsayers, and to me, just as Evil and Dangerous.


I became self aware as age 6, as soon as I started Kindergarten - because I was forced into a Society I knew nothing about. I started to realize then, that I had the right to Question EVERYTHING I was being told and decide for myself. My Parents put a stop to this by telling me if I ever refused to go to Church (Meetings), they would kick me out of the house and I could go be Homeless. I was 11 when they told me this. I tried to research Religion on my own via reading different varieties of books from the Library. I would have to take certain ones and check them out without my Parents finding out because I wasn't allowed to read any Literature that was not made by Jehovah's Witnesses.....This just made me more Angry, more Confused, and more Dedicated to figure out what in the FUCK a Human Being is, and what the FUCK "God" was to everyone else - not just the one sided picture that was being painted for me. I've spent most of my life alone - I was home schooled for grades 10-12, and was not allowed to talk to anyone or befriend anyone who was not of my Religion, being told to the extent that I shouldn't even talk or look at them because they were all evil. The only "Good People" on the Planet, they told me, were Jehovah's Witnesses's, and all those that oppose them would die and are evil when Jesus Returns and the Apocalypse starts.


That fear stayed with me into my early 20's - until I started seriously searching for my OWN SPIRITUALITY via Psychedelic use, and lots of Nuggets to try and dig deeper into the things They had basically forced into my Mind against my will. It got to the point in my early 20's where I would wake up screaming, having panic attacks, thinking that Jehovah was going to strike me with lightning or that the Apocalypse was coming..............This unfortunately has affected my life in ways I can never fix, and is what to this day causes large chunks of my personal issues. I'm still to this day learning BASIC truths about the world around me, that I had NO CLUE about because of how I was raised. I genuinely feel like a good 14-16 years of my life were straight up stolen from me. I was in the Mental Prison that is Religion - ESPECIALLY JW's.


Sorry I've been out of Contact Vortech.........It's been a rough month. I appreciate the acceptance and understanding tho for real, from everyone who's said anything. I've been reading your book bit by bit when I can concentrate long enough to enjoy it - but it's so hard for me to concentrate switching over from a 5 year MXE bender, to nothing for a month, to 3-MeO-PCP. 


I do enjoy the 3-MeO, but I need something I can dose daily - and 3-MeO just isn't as versatile to me as MXE was. It's fucking HEAVY on my mind, but soft on my body. It's a little TOO Serontonergic for my daily needs, and even a 2-3 day bender leaves me feeling a little off for nearly 5-7 days. It also gets even DEEPER into the Religious / Spiritual part of my Mind and Being that I start to get terrible Agoraphobia, not really from taking 3-MeO - but more because I see how fucking fucked up and TERRIBLE the Human Race is being to Itself right now. What happened in France, people posting Bible Verses - shit's taking me back in my mind and forcing me to deal with the issues and statements that my Parents and Jehovah's Witness's left me stuck with, parts of who I am that I can't get to because the beliefs were planted so deep - even tho I don't BELIEVE what I was taught, the Fear and Self Doubt they planted in me I was never able to Uproot. That and I talk to other Humans in Person maybe 5 Times a month at best.


To an extent - I'm back to where I started, just in a different way...............I'm in a Prison of my Own Making inside of My Own Mind - not because of Religion, but because of how Evil People have truly been to me throughout my time outside of the Religion. I do anything and everything I can for my "Friends" that I talk to locally and always have since I moved out at 19, but all they do is take my Kindness for Weakness. I've been robbed twice in the past 30-60 days by people who I have helped pay their Rent so their Family didn't get Evicted, for people I bought Groceries for so their 6 year old daughter and Family had Food till their Stamps came.....Helped them finish Painting Jobs he was too inexperienced to finish on his own. The thing that scares me is - My Parents never prepared me for the fact or reality that the World we Live in is not nice, a large chunk of our Population are either just Rats in the Race - Religiously Oriented and only care about "Their People" like my Parents - Or still Animalistic in the Jungle, always SELFISHLY putting themselves first, not caring about the past, present or future - just taking all they can until YOU stop giving, and then they act like you're the dick............


The thing is, FUCK Money - that's not what hurts, it comes and goes - The pain comes from the fact that I'm starting to feel like I need to be a little more evil and selfish JUST so I can make it and take care of myself. I feel like I can't trust another Person, especially Women (No Offense to any Female on here). I've just been abandoned and thrown away by so many people that I cared so deeply about, and who I held the fuck down like a real friend should. As much as I love the Internet and Computers - I HATE Facebook and Social Media. It's just allowed people to choose to be even MORE Cliquey than they were BEFORE Social Media took over. I'm from the 90's, when you went to your boy's house and just talked, listened to music or watched a show. When People were a little more Human. I really don't like the way our Society is going right now - and I'm really sick of being the cliche "nice guy who finishes last". I could go on - but I'll leave it at that. Just some background for those that treat BL like your Family because the people you know in real life don't know how to act anymore. Shit breaks my heart. I always find a way through tho - I just have to keep moving forward and not allow my thoughts to remain Stagnant. Peace to my BL Fam - Meowfish

woah meowfish thats pretty fucked up. i didn't mean to insult u or anything. just meant that it kinds of made me think you sound angry or something when u wrote it, which u kind of admitted i guess, manic. im sure that u mean well and im glad you feel get positive experiences from dissociatives. obviously i just hope you know they can be dangerous and can drive someone up the wall without them realizing it.. i read your posts a long time ago and u said how u dont feel theres any side effects except for some bloody urine and spleen removal or something and i was just thinking if that happened to me i would take it pretty seriously

I don't suppose there is any information regarding how MXE affects cats.


My cat accidentally ingested small amounts of it last night. After I weight it out, I crush the crystals with the bottom of a lighter. Then, without really thinking, I wipe the little bit of residue from the lighter on my bed. So I left the room and when I came back my cat was sniffing and licking the area. It couldn't have been much MXE. She appeared alert for a while, and was in a very playful mood running around the house. I could sense that she was dissociated. Her pupils dilated as she looked at me, possibly wondering whether or not it was really me. After running around the house a couple of laps, she settled on my lap and slept a bit heavier than usual. But then later in the night she would try to sleep but would wake up and jump off the bed, leaving the room. Restless, it seems. 


I feel so terrible for letting this happen ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png). I really hope she doesn't suffer any long term effects. I love Clementine more than anything. She seems fine now, nestled in my blankets ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png).

She's probably fine. I worry about the same things with my pet guinea pig and my ball python, I just avoid handling them now if I've been weighing out any drugs, and I make sure to clean up right after so as to not have one of them stumble upon anything when out of their habitats.

Re: MXE and cats, they are very sensitive to it. 1mg is enough for effects It's a love/hate relationship I'm pretty sure is their response, or that was my conclusion after the one time I dosed my cat when I was high. To explain further, it is not a 100% enjoyable experience for them, but much like humans, I think they are better off for it in the end having had the experience. Until more is known let's stick to the stuff that grows from the ground, i.e. catnip ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

my concern with MXE and cats is that cats have pretty cruddy kidneys compared to humans.  but if its a small amount one time it should be okay.  would be great if it drank a lot of fluids to help clean the stuff out of its system... however, you can lead a cat to water but you can't make it drink.


milk might be a good idea for it.

Put the water from a tuna tin in the water for the cat. They love it.

Only water, not the ones with oil.

My friend's old cat was in poor shape and obviously about to die. We thought it would be nice of us to let him try MXE before he dies, maybe it would help him deal with his injuries and poor health. We never did it though and would never actually give drugs to any animal.

Milk is actually bad for cats, generally. Not much on the topic of MXE but it is harm reduction I guess.

I am not sure how recently this happened but I heard through the grapevine yesterday that MXE is illegal in Florida, and certain people are trying to make it completely banned in the United States? This news saddens me greatly. I have been using MXE as a recreational drug for almost two years now. When I first began using it up until fairly recently I had only taken it for fun. Over the last few months I have battled greatly against two addictions, them being alcohol and benzodiazepines. I never thought that I could get over the hump of never feeling content or satisfied with life again, but I have a found a way and that way is MXE. Don't get me wrong, I have read many stories about the addictive properties that MXE can possess and have even witnessed it first hand, but let me tell you.


I can take 6 mgs and feel completely at peace with myself, a miracle for someone like me who has battled addiction for a long time. Throughout the day I have been dosing myself about 6 mgs four or five times a day. To say it is helping me is an understatement. The best medicine I have ever had, and I have been on many different kinds of anti-depressants and mood stabilizers. I can go to work, accomplish tasks that need to get done outside of work, focus on healthy hobbies, set goals for myself and achieve them, newly inspired dreams, all while taking small doses of MXE throughout the day. I am now worried that at some point some time soon this amazing chemical will be gone forever, and I have never found anything else that even comes close in comparison.


I realize the importance of being able to do these things without the aid of drugs, but right now it is helping me find the way. Finally I can just live in a mindful manner without a constant chip on my shoulder. Sorry for the rant just some random thoughts that I will try to add more to later. Banning something with such potential as this would truly be a crime against humanity imo, but I guess I feel that way about a lot of things.

It is great to hear your story Mr Giraffe. I empathize completely with your scenario, for I also used this tool to battle greater demons. More recently it was 3-meo-pcp that gave me the conviction to get off opiates for good. It may be even more effective than MXE because while MXE helped many times temporarily, I felt like it didn't get me to see the big picture so succinctly as my recent experience with 3meo. But maybe it was all just timing. I was ready anyway.


As for the cats, my cat lived to a healthy 20 years old, and he drank lactose-free milk nearly every day of the week. In fact he would have a fit if we ever ran out for more than a day. That was actually how I administered the MXE the one time, in his milk, to disguise the taste. Cats are very picky about their water. We had a machine that constantly circulated water in his bowl through a water fountain, and he drank from it all the time. Cats like flowing water. This contributed to his kidneys lasting so long.

I know it is a moral grey area to dose a cat on anything psychoactive because of the lack of consent, and I will agree. Stick to catnip and let them sniff it willingly. However, when a cat is at end-stage life, it may be akin to giving mushrooms to cancer patients to help then cope with their final days. I know my cat handled it like a champ. To be honest, even at 18 years old when I gave him that dose, for a while after that experiment I noticed a spark in his eyes and energy that had previously been dulled. I'm not encouraging anyone to repeat my experiment. Just putting it out there so that maybe qualified scientists may look into it as a treatment for cats who have a deficiency of life force (depression, recurrent illness etc).


I feel cats are more similar to humans than many people will admit.

I totally agree with you Giraffe. Mxe also has also completely regenerated my life. I had already giving up the ghost, believed i would spend the rest of my life from my small apartment cage to my work office cage, doing a job i hated.


I was wrong. MXE showed me i was wrong. Now i live in a paradise island doing what i love with the people i love. Talk about a drug success story

That's amazing man. ![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif)  I had the same experience 7 years ago, not from a drug but because I visited the place I live now and had a powerful moment that slammed into me where I knew I was home and had to live here.  Actually now that I think about it, I was on 5-MeO-MiPT at the time. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  But I don't think it was the reason.

Thank you all for your responses, I was very worried about my cat. She is fine, though ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


Does anyone else find it difficult to "integrate" one's self with the real world after MXE is removed? I, like so many others, have found such a profound serenity using MXE. It makes me feel so at ease, and my consumption of other drugs (opiates, benzos) is greatly reduced when I am on it. I almost forget I 'need' drugs to cope with life. Also it allows my mind to flow so much, I struggle with communication as it is, even on forums. MXE has allowed me to experience a whole new world, I can finally express my thoughts and emotions by creating music. It opens the floodgates.


But when it runs out, I just lose my drive and revert to my previous self. Then I end up taking more drugs to try to recreate the state of mind I was able to achieve with MXE. I'm running low now, and I am not looking forward to tomorrow. I'm trying to tell myself that I don't need it, but I really don't know.


Maybe something like tianeptine may help, but that is off topic.

Ahh...I've only tried M once, at a moderate dose, and it was such a wonderful mixture of K and DXM with this special factor...call it the M factor...i'd love to try it again.

Sun Drugs, I know you may be seeking a faster or easier answer, but time is the great integrator. Give yourself a month of drying out. Resist the cravings with all your might, even if only for the desire to see what is on the other side of the mountain. Try to resist using other drugs to fill the void for they will muddy the water. Eventually you will start to see new life and inspiration arise out of the void, and the reflections on your MXE experiences will click into the greater perspective one by one.

If you really need something to get you through that month you can juditiously use another dissociative for it may help speed up the integration of past MXE experiences. This was my experience, but if you want the clearest picture there is only one way 'out', and that is 'through'. 

This recommendation is based on the last few months of my life without MXE. It has been a natural awakening of sorts, perhaps partly because I gave space to let the MXE reflections take root. I realized in the end, after all the writing and integration of my own teaching, that I have taken MXE to its logical conclusion. Time to move on at least for now. However people like us tend to need a refresher of spirits every once in awhile in some form, just try to make it the good spirits.

I think s-isomer mxe combined with s-isomer ketamine would probably be the best dissociative experience one can have. the different durations could allow you to align peaks in different ways.


did anyone ever get to the bottom of how good or bad for you combining MXE with MDMA or MDA is?

low doses fine. Mxe first then mda was incredible. Mxe and mdma almost as good. It lasted a really long time though basically glowing for 24 hours. However the time I did mxe+mda i redosed both mxe and mda 48 hrs after first dose stupidly and it was kinda bad. Idk if I was sleep deprived or my body was telling me to stop, I had a auditory alarm going off, like literally a beep beep beep sound going through my head. Thought I was dying tbh because everyone talks about SS, but I was fine later on.

Were you able to get off of benzos permanently by using mxe? When I was stuck on benzos I found I didn't need to dose my benzos during the day if I took mxe, but by the time night came and the MXE wore off I needed a benzo really badly, it was a certain feeling that was not very good. I personally could not picture quitting benzos and using mxe to quit with. I did get off a many year benzo habit but I didn't take many drugs during that time. I just drank when the feelings got really bad. I could never sleep on mxe, so in my benzo days I wouldnt be able to not take one to end the mxe session and its immediate residual effects from the night. I would wake up with a nice glow but getting to bed on mxe was difficult. I haven't had any mxe since I quit benzos. And I really miss it, I would love to see what it's like now without benzos muddying my mind. It would probably be a lot better therapeutically.

Vortech, discussing dosing of animals is more than frowned upon... indeed like you said there is no consent, and animals may react very differently to psychoactives... especially ones that for us expand the consciousness, and like it or not cats are on quite a different level of self-awareness etc with regard to consciousness than us, so you can't project your own ideas about being able to integrate and bear the effects onto your pet.


Sure it's very sad when a loved pet grows old and dies, but you bring him to the vet to get anything the cat might need to live comfortably until he just cannot anymore. And anaesthesia with K is a different story by the way, it's pretty much just necessary - can't really comment on the difference with an anaesthetic dose... The sentiments do not justify dosing your cat, it is not a relationship of equals where you can give your terminally ill friend acid upon his request - it is irrelevant that you have the best intentions wanting that for your cat.


This sends a very wrong message on a forum like BL. Your pet is not your 'guinea pig'.

No, I apologize as I probably was not clear on what I said here in regards to benzo withdrawal and MXE. I went to a rehab where I was put on a slow drawn out Librium taper over the course of thirty days in order to taper off of the benzos that I had been taking/abusing for two years. 


The aftermath. Me three months later using MXE in small doses to guide myself in an attempt to find peace and happiness by means of drugs. Contrary to my prior postings it isn't working out so good. Even with the guidance of MXE, I am still having major issues with alcohol cravings and what have you. I am just waiting to be rescued.


And yes vortech, I respect you completely but would never give my kitty drugs ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png) All is well as you see the error in your ways though. I wish him all the best and you as well brother.

I don't usually post in these threads any more, I use to really enjoy reading them. For those unfamiliar with who I am, I use to have a really bad addiction to MXE,eyeballing doses, doing upwards of a gram and a half a day of the excellent stuff MOTD and USResearchChems use to get. I still remember my first gram from VisionarySupply. 


Any how, I just wanted to come on here and give a warning to you guys not to mix MXE and 1p-LSD. A few weeks ago, around October, I had a terrible experience with these two substances, almost dying.


I had recently received what was suppose to be 2 grams of MXE from a reputable source, however it ended up being on a gram (I got ripped off). Regardless, it was some of the finest I've ever laid eyes on. White, fluffy, sparkly, just like snow. 


Anyhow, I had been dosing continuously, just like old habits. Fast forward to about 4am, after about 250mg throughout the day, along with a few bags of heroin here and there (I'm a heroin addict unfortunately, it's difficult for me to go without) I decided to take about 200 to 300ug of 1p-LSD, right about doing a 80 to 100mg line of MXE.


Bad move.


I stood outside and watched the sun rise and it was spectacular as the 1p-LSD came up. I stared into the sky and into space, saw things I can't even describe. But as the 1p-Lsd hit me, it created a synergy where I lost my mind.


The next 2 or so hours after the come up are a blur. All I remember is one minute I'm staring out my window, the next I'm trying to kill myself by jumping through my second floor bedroom window, convinced god and the devil are pulling my strings. I was not in a good headspace so I was trying to escape life and this repetitive mundane hell I was in, I thought killing myself was the only way, all I saw was light outside and I thought this was heaven, inside my room was black and it was hell. For 30 or so mins I tried ripping my curtain down and smashing through my window, struggling with myself on whether this is what God wanted. I was convinced I was God at one point (Definitely the MXE, as I've felt this before) and I, or He/She, had fucked up by creating life, it was a mistak, one that could not be undone and forever locked in battle with the devil. 


Next thing I know I wake up on my floor, my coffee table broke underneath me (I was standing on my coffee table trying to break through my window) and snot all over myself. I must have had a seizure or something cause I blacked out and fell onto my table. 


All I remember after waking up is seeing colors and thinking every color was some interdimension extra terrestrial race, silver was the only peace and staring at the bracelet I had and thinking about the girl I loved more than anything, crying to myself realizing I was still alive and trapped in this life, suffering. 


tl:dr - Don't do MXE followed by 1p-LSD.

I know of only one source left, and supply is dwindling. I just don't get it. Are there no chemists capable of making MXE in the US? I have never heard of an RC that is still legal and in such a high demand yet so rare to come by. When is the big comeback supposed to happen??

Technically MXE could fall under the analogue act if someone were to get busted with it and the police decided to send it to a lab for analysis. But most RC's would fall into the analogue act in a situation like that. I believe it is specifically banned in Florida & maybe Alabama though.

Interesting.


In your opinion is MXE generally a fairly safe drug to experiment with?


Also, I've asked a couple times and most people say that it's relatively safe to take while on an SSRI.


I'm on Lexapro so that's why I ask.

^its actually banned in 10 states but still federally unscheduled. 


Be careful with SSRIs and MXE, but considering the lack of dangerous interactions reports and the number of people that take SSRIs, my guess is there is a margin of safety. 


I self-medicated with MXE for too long to treat chronic fatigue, depression and opioid addiction. I still believe it has a place in all this- I mean I wouldn't have taken it for years if it didn't work, but the real progress in tackling these disorders came after I stopped taking MXE. 

I have stopped opioid use and am in an outpatient program to support it, and I have started taking buproprion (wow an approved pharmaceutical that doesn't totally suck!) which is helping the chronic fatigue and depression. 


Also I probably still wouldn't have a girlfriend if I still took MXE. As peacephrog1972 mentioned, it had a way filling the role of a lover.

^^Yeah, MXE itself is fairly benign... but if you let it take ahold of you, it can be just like any other addiction. I've been successfully using it once every month or so these days, but this time last year I was doing it multiple days a week.

No, it has everything to do with the combination. It was an almost lethal combo, not because I almost jumped out of a window but because of the effect it had on my body. The only thing I can relate it to is some kind of seizure like event where I completely went psychotic in a sense, essentially blacking out (I did black out for a minute, or two, or three, I don't really even know). If you are inferring the heroin had something to do with it, not at all because I had last dosed almost 10 hours prior to doing the 100mg line of MXE and 300 or so micrograms of 1p-lsd. 


I have taken MXE many, many, many times, in very high doses, and I have taken 1p-lsd three times. Never have I ever experienced anything close to that on their own.

You say that but many others have done the combination with no dangerous effects, and you cannot simply blame the combination when there are so many elements at play. I intentionally did not specify a different reason for the adverse effects because there are too many possibilities for me to go casting blame when I have such a limited picture of the situation surrounding the events. However, I would suggest you to remember that humans are often influenced and affected psychosomatically, a phenomena that becomes even more pervasive during the psychedelic experience.

So I've done some searching and didn't find any definite answer to my question through Google so I figured I'd ask here, would there be any reasonably easy way to wash MXE that's presumed to be 70% purity, the other 30% being caffeine as a cut? It's the best MXE I can find but its recently been said to be 30% caffeine on Reddit among other places and I'd love to be able to do a wash of it if I wouldn't lose more than 30%-40% of my product. Any advice would be great, thanks!

Fuck whoever cut that MXE, I remember seeing that. I don't have much reason to believe that it's even MXE, but if it actually is, what blasphemy to cut something so precious. Prices are already outrageous now, why try and juice people for even more..


I don't have much useful advice about cleaning it. Google says caffeine is soluble in acetone, I couldn't find any solid answers about whether or not MXE is soluble in acetone as well, though. If you dig a bit deeper there's probably an answer. If it's not soluble then you could probably do an acetone wash. Remember to dry the acetone first.

I might be off on this one but if the MXE is cut with caffeine than it may be a nearly 100% pure product that needs to be toned out and made off and unreliable, it is research after all. I had a batch one time that produced nothing but negative effects and one of my first thoughts was caffeine but actually it was just a percent or two off in purity and this can become an easy chore to understand when it comes to MXE

from what i can tell, it is definitely 30% caffeine, not just people guessing based on idiosyncratic reactions.  don't want to get too far into vendor discussion, but yeah -- seems to definitely be a 70%/30% cut that is going around.

Looks like I'll be getting a few grams of some MXE from before the recent drought soon... I'm excited, because I've missed it as an adjunct to psychedelics.  I think it's the very best thing I've ever used to combine with tryptamines in particular, at the right dose it makes the whole thing more immersive and comfortable, and adds its own psychedelic aspects as well.  I'm really looking forward to some more of those combinations. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  I have some DPT that I intend to IM, but I wanted to wait until I had either ketamine or MXE to add to it.  I think MXE will do nicely, it has for every other psychedelic I've mixed it with (not just tryptamines).


I don't really care to take it on its own anymore, so even sharing with my friends it should last a very long time. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I hope someone steps up the the plate to keep the supply flowing.. I still love taking it on its own. It's just such a special compound in my opinion, I don't want to see it disappear forever, seems crazy. Ketamine is cool but it doesn't give me the manic motivation from MXE I love so much.

I also prefer MXE to ketamine.  I can't imagine it will disappear forever because it's just as good as any of the "big drugs" (better than most) and lots of people want it... demand is high.  I'm surprised no one has done it yet, but I'm sure it will happen.

So would an acetone wash work for MXE the same as it would for cocaine or amphetamine then?


And yeah, MXE isn't going away, even with the ban. There is simply too much demand.

Sean, yes an acetone wash will work exactly the same as for coke/mdma as mxe.


Xorkoth, i agree mxe combines beautifully with psychs. It helps to calm everything down and allow me to immerse more fully in the moment. I honestly dont even like tripping without mxe at this point :-(


Ketamine has its place, but i wouod take a lifetime supply of mxd before ketamine anyday

I have a question.

When holing on mxe i guess it's pretty common to experience movements, floating, melting, tilting, twisting, twirling of the body when laying down.


Do you get this feeling sometimes when laying in bed even if the last time mxe is a while ago?


I had this sometimes even though to a lesser extend even years after my last use.


Now it's gone. I liked it.

I would like to update anyone interested the progress of my book 'A Multidisciplinary MXE Analysis'. The currently available link has been stuck at version .99 since December, and I have a lot less free energy now but have been continuing to work on it when the stars align, reading/researching, squashing bugs, expanding sections with hard science, and cutting out some of peripheral sections that had little-to-nothing to do with the core- often those sections were written under the influence and seemed profound at the time...but we know how dissociative (hypo)mania can alter our sense of profundity ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

A question for my fellow MXE aficionados.


Does MXE ever make you hypomanic, and if so, are there any particular combinations or circumstances in which it seems more likely to do so?


I sometimes get a few days of hypomania after an evening on MXE and I love it. I get so much shit done and I feel like a goddamn jedi, and it's mild enough that I don't veer into self-destructive behavior. It seems like it's more likely if I combine it with other drugs; it definitely doesn't happen consistently with pot, but it's happened at least a couple of times with 5-meo-mipt. I may play with the latter combination this week, and I'll report back if I do.


ETA I don't have a history of bipolar or of mania other than this.

One of the key aspects of the M-hole is the feeling of being eternal nothingness but yet your still experiencing this nothingness. If you guys haven't ever heard Alan Watts lecture on nothingness being the fundamental reality of something then I suggest you check it out. Truly amazing how the m-hole relates so perfectly.

I can totally relate to that. I've been in some states with this substance but would take it again in a heartbeat. I've been using 3-MeO-PCP but it not as good as MXE. I've tried a lot of chemicals in my time and nothing compares to MXE. It was a fucking roller coaster of a drug. It helped as an anti depressant but I always pushed it to far.

Hey there,


I still have a few grams of pre-ban MXE from 2013 to 2015. 


Do you think it will still be active?


Any clues?

It should be just as active as the day you got it. The arylcyclohexylamines are pretty stable compounds.

Yeah, if its inactive you're doing something wrong. I've ingested MXE from 2014 somewhat recently and felt there was no potency loss.

I inadvertently and completely unintentionally experienced my first hole.


Long story short at the peak of a candyflip, I though adding some mxe would be beneficial. I've added mxe to a candy flip with much success in the past. However, this time I decided to eyeball a line to rail, rather than eat a tiny pinch of it as I normally do.


I rail what I thought was about 25mg (turns out my eyes are poor scales) and continue on my fun.


About 45 min later I go smoke a joint and all hell broke loose. According to my girlfriend, about half way through my joint, I suddenly stopped talking and went catatonic for about 30 minutes.


What I experienced was hands down the most profound experience I have ever encountered. It is incredibly hard to put into words but I will try. I felt as if I had fallen through a portal to another world. I was so out of it I completely forgot that I had taken any drugs at all. I saw myself and started talking in understandable jabbering to myself. 


It quickly appeared to me that my entire reality was a figment of my imagination, my friends, my family, my job was all made up to keep myself occupied in this neither realm where I simply existed.


About half way through my catatonia, my gf dragged me into my room and put me on the bed. She said I had the million yard stare.


My next memory is laying in bed with a time loop. My gf asked me if I was ok, then she said hey you're ok, you are just on drugs, then my buddy coming into my room and saying you alive man?


While I don't think it actually happened more than once, this exact scenario played on a loop about 5 times. By the 4th time, I started to get incredibly paranoid as I thought I had broken the damn universe and was stuck in this endless stupid loop. 


The stress of this caused my heart to start beating and gave me a shot of adrenaline which snapped me back to reality.


I have done mdma and lsd countless times and probably made my way through 5 G's of mxe but never in my life have I experienced anything like that.


Wild shit.

I could do with some advice here. I love MXE but always seem to overdo it and get really messy. I want to get the most out of it but I barely remember anything because I take so much. But I know there is something special there.

Yeah, I have gotten hypomanic and manic on it many times. I have taken it while being on SSRIs, SNRIS, as well as off. It still does it to me in anything over 30 mg...I have schizoaffective bipolar type

I always just set out the amount I desire to do over the night before I begin, then I put the rest away. From there it's entirely up to you to keep from uping your dose.

Anyone know if the darknet MXE that is making the rounds, but which appears to be cut with caffeine, is any good? Would be a low-dose of caffeine, so I can't imagine it being *that* bad. I like mid-dose MXE for hanging out at home, so don't want to be stimulated. Not too interested in holing yet.


Otherwise, does anyone know a simple wash or A/B would clear out the caffeine? Any word on solvents?

I had asked this before about the wash and an acetone wash should work fine. Also, I'm assuming that's the same MXE cut with caffeine that was originally being sold by a clearnet vendor a month back or so, and yeah it's pretty good. Not the best, the caffeine does make it feel odd - but still pretty good.

Yesterday I tried MXE for first time. 39mg insufflated was quite inmersive, more than I was expecting. It rang a bell of my ketamine's experiences ages ago. I even reproduced my first experience to details I thought I had long forgotten.


I'm not a disociatives head. Only have wide experience with ketamine in low to moderate dosages. I never liked much ketamine as was quite nauseous most times. It's been ages since my last dose but I liked MXE more, a bit more deep, slower onset, longer duration and better general feeling. Though still quite confusing and blurry. 

I'm not sure about the quality, in a few days I'll get the results. It might be that the not so good experience is due to that.


A few months ago I tried Mxp, it felt quite toxic but was kind of interesting, and most important dissipated my fears toward dissociatives ketamine induced. 

One month ago I had some experiences with 3-meo-pcp (3, 5.5 and 8mg) and those were far better in my opinion. Just much more clearheaded and inspirating. So different from ketamine. So psychedelic kind of thinking. It really caught my interest and curiosity in dissos, so much I had to take a break. After reading so many stories of disso-adictions, huge tolerances, psy-wards and with my drugs abuse history... 

I'm trying to start well and do it well since the beginning as I know once you get the wrong path you are left with the difficult decision of leaving the path completely or keep in the wrong one. I've got enough adictions and unrational uses already. Lost all benefits and magic from downers and uppers and feel impulsive towards them.


What I enjoyed in MXE was the relaxation post effect that allow you to drift into sleep. Its afterglow might be the best and most anti-depressant of the 3. 

So all in all I was a bit dissapointed as I had very high expectations. My thoughts got too abstract to get anything I could take back to my sober life, at least in a concious way, though it crossed my mind that the therapeutic benefit could be very well unconcious.


 Though didn't stop my curiosity and I'll continue my careful research into higher dosages. Probably this time I'll take sublingual as I heard is more effective. And insufflating is addictive by itself.


Is it known how long is the half life of that one?

How long should I wait between dosages to not create any kind of tolerance and be in the safe side? And with 3-meo-pcp (suppose much longer)? 


Read a bit about the opiate affinity so I was wondering if this could trigger a WD from opioids. Sorry I cannot go through all the 17 threads.:D


And last but not least...How much should I take to get into a hole? and how scary could that be? I heard around here to some posters that high dissociatives dosages are somewhat easier to ride than midrange.


I feel like I'm playing away with dissociatives. It's a bit like travelling abroad as a child, to some distance country were nobody understands me and everything is weird. In psychedelic land I feel much more at home.

All the questions you have asked I address somewhere in my book, but in the meantime I can give you some rough answers. The opioid affinity is low if anything so don't worry about it creating WD symptoms. In my experience it had more of a potentiating/synergy effect than anything.

To get into a 'hole' is not an exact number due to individual response, tolerance, ROA, set/setting and the subjective definition of what a 'hole' is, but as a rough number, hole effects reveal at around 60ish mg when tolerance is still relatively low. It is easy to achieve when laying down or sitting in a peaceful state as the effects take hold with some really immersive textured music playing.


It is not unexpected that the first experience with MXE is underwhelming. The true potential tends to show after a few experiences for whatever reasons we can only guess, but the qualities of  blurriness and confusion that you mention decrease as acquaintance with the experience increases. Also as you mentioned try a different ROA on the next experiments. Intranasal is the least dissociative of the ROAs but it is a good way to introduce the experience. Oral and sublingual are a good next step to increase immersion.


The time to wait between doses is also variable especially when other dissociatives like 3meo-pcp have been used, but there is a sweet spot in timing that is not too soon but also not too long in between doses. My best answer is to use your intuition. To build upon previous experience but not encounter too much tolerance I would answer as an average of about 3 or 4 days to get into an evolution of effects without burning it out. That average will ebb and flow as the relationship to the experience evolves, I.e. it may be more often during a honeymoon phase and then less often later to mitigate tolerance growth/maintain appreciation. 

This was my experience.

Thanks for your effort and time, very informative and helpful. So is your book for selling? or where can it be obtained?. I read you at some point before talking about it but didn't pay attention. I imagine it like a summary of the 17 threads plus even more info and with all pointless and repetitive post like mine cut out from it.![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

I always feel very hypomanic  the day after a large dose of MXE (around 100mg spaced into 4 25mg bumps 30mins apart from eachother or so usually).  

I find this aspect really fascinating about MXE. It's one of the very few entheogens that consistently DOES NOT make you feel like crap the next day. 

I partook of MXE last night after almost a year and a half break from it ( I've had it about 10 times over the last 3 years or so mostly at highish doses of 50-125mg nasally). 

After last night's experience it dawned on me that on every single large dose (around 50+mg) I consistently feel as though I'm breaking through the underlying reality that we normally experience and it's like I'm experiencing something closer to divine or At least reality from a higher dimension.  Often I feel at the peak as if the gods ( or some sort of higher intelligence) is smiling down at me in a sort for simply peering through this reality. 

I know this all sounds crazy and once the majority of the peak ends I no longer feel this way but this always leads to some sort of positive realization about myself. 

I find this extrordinary about this chemical above all others. 

I should also point out that only do MXE very very sporadically (like a few times a year). And I always spend a lot of time trying to make sense of my MXE experience and integrate into my my life before attempting another trip. 

But yeah, WOW just extrordinary stuff!

Here is a link to the book. It is perpetually unfinished and at times goes on pretty wild tangents that are only loosely related to MXE, but there is also a lot of very informative information and a very thorough resources section at the end.

My friend and I were discussing this yesterday.  He (and many others) get that hypomanic effect the day following dissociatives (especially MXE).  I myself have never one time gotten it.  I get hypomanic ON dissociatives sometimes, which I love, but never the day after.  I feel fine the day after, just not elevated above normal.  I wonder why that is?

No, still getting real MXE made freshly in Europe. Thing is, one moment I am fine and the next, after another line of course, I can't even talk. I think I have the answers I need, I think I need to develop more patience and wait a bit longer for it to work before ploughing in, I think I expect too much too quickly. I think a gramme should last a fair while, hope I can actually put in to practice what I preach. But I have had some fantastic psychedelic experiences at times though, almost LSD like visuals with swimming walls and some other peculiar hallucinations.

I had my second experience with MXE. This time I took it sublingualy, though I don't know how much was absorbed, probably half of it was oral. I took 43mg and the experience was much better than with 39mg insufflated. I think I'm done with insufflating this.

The general feeling was much better, the experience less blurry and I found it quite inspiring and emotional. Was expecting it to be stronger but wasn't. Just more clear and comfortable at the same level of intensity or maybe a bit less. Effects lasted longer and it wasn't so easy to fall sleep like first time. Strangely enough it left me quite depressed for a day. I felt a strong desire to repeat the experience though I managed to resist the urge in the last moment.


I analysed it and results show it's MXE and nothing else. It was purchased short ago, so it can be found right now at reasonable prices.

All in all I really like it. Much better than ketamine if you ask me, though I'm curious to see how ketamine would feel after this. It's up there with 3-meo-pcp for me.

Very strange... So far, after much experimentation I've actually found that I prefer nasal ROA for MXE...though most don't. 

I personally find intranasal to be the most clear headed and the least "anaesthetic ". ROA. 

YMMV!!!

My favorite ROA with MXE is sublingual by a long shot, it's like an oral dose that kicks in faster. I also prefer that with 3-meo-pcp, but it feels too caustic to be worth it. So far I've only snorted my 3-meo-pcp but the couple times I used the sublingual ROA, I really preferred it but it burns my mouth quite a bit.


I find the effect sublingual of MXE and 3-meo-pcp opposed to snorting to be way rounder, fuller, and provide more powerful centralized/thought-provoking effects with more serene visual claritty. Whereas snorting them gives me more of a stimmy, peripheral, visual noisy type effects. 


I'll have to try 3-meo-pcp orally, it might be better for me than snorting, but the onset time might sway me back to snorting it.

Variance in effects with ROA with some drugs is fascinating!

I've found the one time l tried oral and plugged MXE to be feel very "anaesthetic" (numb all over) but I haven't tried sublingual yet...

Last night's experiment was a total disappointment, 125mg and no hole whereas 50mg a few weeks earlier had such stunning mental images as I was curled up in bed listening to Herbst9 (which I usually do on MXE because it's such otherworldly dark ambient- but maybe I should actually try listening to something with more structure when attempting to hole??)

By the last bump I was unusually still clear headed so I decided to curl up in bed and things just got ultra confused for several hours with no interesting headspace or psychedelia?!?  

MXE is perplexing to say the least!!!

Yeah the variance in effects I get from MXE is pretty staggering.  Even from the same ROA, same dose, separated by sufficient time.  What's more, when I take it with other people, we always seem to experience the same trip.  One night it was really weird and uncomfortable for all of us, we were listening to music and it sounded so tinny and emotionless, whereas usually we all find it to enhance music.

MXE's a strange beast. Even with exceptional tolerance to NDMA antagonists, and using it exclusively IM at nearly the same doses every time, I still can get wildly varying trips every time. It's part of the reason I love it. In that sense, it can be a lot less dull than other NDMA antagonists....

^But then it's a real bummer when it doesn't produce the trip you were looking for. I feel like about 20% of my MXE trips end up a bit disappointing, and I hate that, since I have so little material left ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)

To me though variance is the key! I rarely use NDMA antagonists anymore so it's not that big of a deal to me. Basically every time I do MXE it's like a new trip, whereas ketamine is more like the same ol' same ol'. The best is combining MXE with lysergamides/phenethlyamimes, or other NDMA antagonists... Some of my most memorable MXE excursions where coupled with DMT, nitrous, mescaline, LSD, 2C-B/etc.

Hmm. I've only ever tried MXE and nitrous in the NMDA category. Ketamine has never been available and I simply haven't gotten around to trying the others, and I'm not really interested much in finding out all about 2-meo-diphenidine, diphenidine and ephenidine.


Therefore, I cannot draw a comparison to the consistency or lack thereof of the others. I do agree however, that it seems like a different experience every time. There's more consistency to LSD these days for me even. It seems like the less I use MXE, the more strange the experience becomes hahah.

I missed the boat on this I was off Dissociatives for a while.


Probably a good thing I can't handle Dissociatives. I just went off the rails on a crazy train with 3-meo-pcp and flushed it.


This one sounds better I like putting drugs up my nose for a rush, 3-meo didn't have that really. Probably would have ended up in a padded cell, straight jacketed wavy.

In a number of ways it has the capacity to set off spirit-mind-body reactions that produce some of the strongest love-esque energies I ever experienced. A single signal that comes from a pure place in the heart can seem to open the floodgates in a sense, and cascade into a river of outpouring of energy originating from that inital spark, manifesting as overwhelming empathy, or a buzz, or a complete unbounded receptivity to music, or a resonance of neurons ensembles firing, or some sort of pendulum of oscillating energy at various harmonics, among other possibilities for example.

Sure, here is the [full text](http://docdro.id/AD7bJIW). Professional researchers could distill this for laymen better than myself. For instance, I was trying to figure out what they were saying in the pre-pulse inhibition section...but they were using too many big words...could be they were simply confirming psychomimetic effect, but I think it was more nuanced than that. 


Some things I noted:

It provides a handy flowchart that shows the stages of MXE metabolism into different metabolites, and a graph that shows the concentration of the different metabolites in the blood for the 3 dose levels. MXE's main metabolites, normethoxetamine O-desmethyl-MXE appeared in the brain at about 10x lower than MXE itself. The pharmacology of these metabolites have not been studied, but it is unlikely to be relevent at such low concentrations.* By contrast, norketamine, (a primary ketamine metabolite) exceeds brain levels of ketamine and therefore contributes significantly to its pharmacology*.  One interesting thing noted is that they found metabolism differences between the rats and humans, and concluded *'it is plausible that different isoenzymes at CYP450 are involved in the rat metabolism compared to humans.*


The referenced research articles pointed out a few new interesting articles I had not read, for instance [http://journals.lww.com/behavioural...analogue_methoxetamine_generalizes_to.16.aspx](http://journals.lww.com/behaviouralpharm/Abstract/2016/04000/The_ketamine_analogue_methoxetamine_generalizes_to.16.aspx)


Reading about 'homogenising' rodent brains was interesting... 


Overall it puts a lot together and seems rigorously-conducted (as far as a peon can gather). The result is some new data sets as well as affirmations of previous research and users reports.

Seems those rats are some hard headed creatures: they need 30mg/kg of Ketamine to merely start robowalking! It does indeed seem difficult to project those results on humans, seeing how their body handle drugs differently. Anyhow, there's no lack of human volunteers if need be ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

When in god's name is this beautiful bastard of a chemical going to be available again? Nothing else compares to it and the days have turned to weeks and now into months and months of waiting, waiting, hoping one day to see an announcement of a new (and quality) batch. How can something so amazing just vanish with no sign of return? It doesn't make sense.

Well, it has happened in the past to some quality substances and the chems never came back to the availability as in preban days. Good luck trying to score some 2C-I, mephedrone or bk-MDMA, for example. Just forget about this one and move on. There are some amazing dissociatives right now, 3-MeO-PCP, 3-MeO-PCE, 2-OxO-PCE, 2-OxO-PCM, ephenidine, diphenidine, MXP, 2-fl-ketamine, ketamine itself...

It's wise to stock up on chemicals that are truly extrordinary because who knows when they won't be available anymore. Or when your country passes some draconian blanket drug law (England). 

I hope we do see a return of MXE but I don't think it would be anything but very small scale and you'd have to know those people. 

I think it'll become like synthetic mescaline. It'll be around but it'll be rare.

the difference there is those were all made Schedule 1 in the US.  not sure on 2C-I in the EU but i believe mephedrone and bk-MDMA are both outright banned over there?


MXE isn't banned in the US.  the recent drought is just due to lack of supply, since the countries we got it from mostly banned the stuff themselves.


all its going to take is a decent lab in some other third world country to see the market opening and we will yet again see kilos of MXE coming through the american borders.

You can get all of those if you know where to look for them. bk-MDMA just became tougher to find due to legality reasons, as you may know MSK, but that batch will still find it's way to customers for sure. There *was* some MXE on the darknet, EU-only, but its gone now. It will reappear sometime, however.

 Of course, I've got no problem sourcing those... but you get my point. Now you need to do hard work for sourcing any of those, and MXE on the deepweb has decreased purity and multiplied prices x3, so... I don't expect a good future for this one.

It really would be IMO. MXE is still legal in various places so it's really like TNW put it, finding a new chemical company in a new company willing to do the work! All that would really need to happen(which it probably will, MXE is nearly as popular as ketamine now a days while only being around for 8 or 9 years)is for a few vendors to get a couple to a few kilos each and the game would be back on! Even if it never really surfaces again that openly, it'd be so hard for me to believe it wouldn't go more underground, and sell like that.

I'm praying every night for this to happen, even when there is no God... But I doubt it will came back, if it didn't by now. Suppliers are making a lot of money with other novel dissociatives, they won't bother on making a lab on a foreign country where MXE is not banned, I don't see it!

Why not? Anyone with sense could see the huge profit margin for this sort of thing. People bother synthing illegal psychedelics and dissociatives all the time! No dissociatives can equal MXEs greatness. None that are currently out IMO anyways...

There was a huge market for mephedrone on the past, and only a few Nederland deep web suppliers seems to have it now, and I was scammed a few times with bunk product from those, and high prices... So I'm not very confident that MXE will came back to the mainstream with high purity and awesome prices ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)

Actually meph is still sold locally in some places especially in the last couple of years. I heard India started producing it. It may be in smaller circles but it's also illegal in a lot more places, pretty much banned everywhere, whereas MXE isn't. It's also still legal in the US which is the biggest drug market legal or illegal.

A US rc vendor on reddit claimed to be synthing mxe and be on the verge of releasing it. He then posted that he was doxed and his family threatened and hes gotta shut it down.


Maybe its my tinfoil hat, but the powers that be DO NOT want us to have this chemical specifically. It seems extremely plausible that it was some spooks spookin and not rival vendors ...

Well something happened and MXE evolution just occurred this weekend. Definitely enough to make some modifications to the book. The new batch is unique in itself, and comparing it with some pre-ban material...well...give me a couple days and I'm sure a few new revelations will solidify.

A little birdy said it is weak, and though it does the trick, no, birdy said it is not as good as it used to be. Bear in mind the bird is not me, and I haven't actually tried it. 


I won't be trying any until it comes back full force, full strength. I don't want to ingest whatever crap is making it less than pure MXE, Ive had enough toxic feeling batches of that shit. It was one thing when it was dirt cheap but people need to realize that we want -quality- MXE. Hopefully the market will reflect that. "Weak" MXE makes me think shitty synth laden with impurities, or that it is cut with another disso, or that it is not even MXE. All speculation though! You'd have to ask someone who actually tried this batch. I'm gonna wait til the price drops and quality becomes consistent.

edit: Errr, consistent as far as MXE goes, which is the most inconsistent thing I've ever seen 8(

How is it possible the drought is lasting this long? It's not even illegal here. Someone could become a multimillionaire overnight synthing a quality batch of this stuff. Please, world, come through with more of this stuff. No other dissociative is remotely close to the magic of pure mxe. Tired of all these 'mxe replacement' chems. Even on their own merits, they're 2% of what mxe did for me.

Yeah good luck getting the precursers nessary to make a synth in the north or south america. Not gonna happen unless you got some good conections and then i would just make mdma that sells for more money.

Also heard a big precurser supplier in china shut down recently which lead to quite a few sub par batches.

You would have to already be a multimillionaire to start synthing it over night, though.

As Bluuberry also heard the word from the bird, this 'post-ban' batch of MXE powder was quite weak, not possible to hole on. I don't think any amount of it would get one to the places that the pre-ban material enables, which makes me wonder if it wasn't a matter of it being cut with something inert, but rather it is something quite different, but oddly, somehow, it was still MXE I think. It had an antidepressant effect and kinda energetic but the dissociative aspect was very different. I was more of a functional and almost transparent effect whereas the pre-ban was definitely a *very* altered state just as I remembered it to be, complete with hyperdimensional surfing, astral projection, crazy CEVs, elation, 'that warm energy' feeling, and truly psychedelic as in mind-manifesting. The post-ban did not have near this level of psychedelic effect. Both batches turned into that pink-purple-red goo when vaporized.


TL;DR - The pre-ban batch and the post-ban batch had completely different applications.

So... Does anyone else consistently barf on medium to high doses of MXE???

I tried 4x 25mg rectal doses  last night (1 dose every 15-30mins til gone). 

And near the peak I puked my guys out which seems to happen every single time I dose over 100mg nasally or around 100mg rectally. 

Usually if I vomit, I feel terrible afterwards and need a but of recovery time (like 15mins) but the MXE barf seems like just a purge with no physical discomfort afterwards. It's like ya know I think I'm gonna puke... Then I puke and carry on with my trip. 

It's just unusual for to vomit on anything but I seem to always vomit at the peak of a MXE trip and was wondering if anyone else experiences this??

I should note that I have zero tolorance to Arylcyclohexylamines. 

I do them roughly once a month so for me 100mg is quite a bit. 

No one I've done MXE with has ever barfed by the way. My MXE is pre-ban and the batch I have was tested by energy control to be pure MXE.

I've noticed high dose trips to be comparable in ways to plant medicine psychedelics such as Ayahuasca which is well known for causing purging so that is one way of looking at it as you enter the M-hole. It does help to clear the system when having intense trips as a way of lightening the physical body or as the shamans say of cleansing the spiritual body of unwanted spirits.

No. No arylcyclohexamine has ever caused me nausea or to puke, but if you look at the effects on multiple sites, a lot of them include nausea as one of the side effects. I have a pretty iron clad stomach for the most part though...


If you know something will cause you nausea, your best bet besides anti-emetics is fasting hours before dropping or eating a very light meal of something to provide a bit of energy that is fairly easily digested like certain fruits or vegetables. Once the peak of nausea itself passes cook yourself up a good meal!

The really weird thing is I never have any nausea when I barf on MXE. 

It's more like Vortech said, it's more like purge.  But I get the barfs consistently on MXE. It's like a feeling that food wants to come up. 

I usually have sushi before my MXE trip and I've been blaming it in that but I think it's the MXE.  

I do think it's more like an aya purge than alcohol puking. 

I've just not heard about many others reporting this.

It may not be reported much, but I know I have had at least a couple experiences when I felt burdened by 'foreign spirits' and did MXE for the first time in a month or so, and it resulted in a physical purging, so I don't think the notion is that far off.

Ok, I was really really curious about this because I have not read many reports about emesis on MXE. 

Everytime I dose over 75mg in a single session there will be a 75-90% chance I will barf at the peak. 

But there is never any nausea or feeling of being ill or toxicity or anything like that.  In fact, I consider it to be a stage of my MXE trip at this point. Even if I have nothing in my stomach, when I am approaching the peak of my MXE trip it's like my stomach wants to go through the motions of expulsion and I will just retch up nothing a few times and just carry on with the trip. 

But it certainly feels as though highish doses of MXE makes my stomach want to contract near the peak of the experience. 

If any other users out there experience anything like what I am describing please let me know!

I'd very much appreciate it!

Not sure if this is helpful but Im going to assert that I've never purged on MXE and I'm prone to nausea on most chemicals, I've just learned to deal with it for everything from opiates to mushrooms to acid to coffee. MXE and 3-meo-pcp are basically the only things besides benzos and cannabis that never make me nauseous. Though cannabis OD's do make me really ill actually, but thats a different story, it takes a lot. 


I've taken really high doses of MXE and I never had that. Damn I miss MXE ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png). Someone better get their bunsen burner lit, I agree that it's absurd no one has really stepped up to the plate yet. People are willing to pay at least as much for it as any other popular powders. We want MXE dammit.

Hey guys I got lucky today and discovered a gram of 2011 pre ban mxe. This came out right around the time the yellow sandy polymorph mxe was around. It's litterally been sitting in a box in the basement for 5 years. Does it lose potency at all? Also I am 99% sure this was white when I got it but oxidised to a very pale beige yellow powder. 

I have never used mxe before so whatis a good starting dose? And I don't have any regents but I wanted to know what does it usually taste like is there a telltale taste for this stuff. I'm not looking for a drug ID im 99%, sure its mxe. Unfortunately it was labeled by a number system and the actual bag it's in does not say mxe just the catalogue number 21#

Fuckin' lucky bitch. Really pure methoxetamine had very little taste for me, but the less pure stuff was always kinda salty tasting. The pure stuff was kinda salty too but hard to notice because it was so faint.

I only ever bought two batches. One has close to no taste, and the other one, which is the most potent one by the way, has a weird chemical taste. I sometimes think it is leftover solvent, but maybe it's just the taste of pure MXE? I dunno.

I've had tasteless MXE, MXE that tasted like table salt, and MXE that tastes salty a bit, but also bitter.  Each one had a different appearance... the tasteless one was pure white and powdery, the salty one was slightly off-white and sandy, and the bitter one is insanely clumpy in a way I've never seen with another chemical.

Yeah I got a ton of gram size free samples for some programing work on a now gone but at one time a huge USA RC vendor. Back in the good old days. I just really like visual drugs.

 I never really fucked with the dissos that much as they kinda scare me. Just like I still got a gram of 3 meo PCP from that era I don't know if I would ever use it again. Don't like the robotic feel. Does mxe feel robotic like drunken slow vision ala 3 meo.

Ketamine never appealed to me and remained one of the only drugs I Haven't tried. 

What's the appeal for you guys of this chemical  and stuff like k before I visit it.

Ketamine and mxe and all dissos don't sound like they a good for groups. This only would seem like a good idea to use any disso at home alone r with a expierenced sitter.

I do remember when this was available 2 kinds of mXe were around straingt white mxe and a sandy yellow batch. This im sure was the white kind.

I get the impression from here that a lot of people use them for some kind of medicinal benefit. Usually depression or chronic fatigue. I think they can induce a kind of mania which can be beneficial in the treatment of these.

The real value to me and many others is the versatility. It is at once a medicinal quality rapid-acting antidepressant, an anesthetic and stimulant, yet also a powerful psychedelic that strikes the heart of the soul ,exhibiting empathogenic qualities as well as unusual phenomenology such as feelings of shared/connected consciousness, heightened deep-memory recall and abstract conceptualization, waking lucid dreaming, deep meditative states, and even astral projection. These experiences and more create the potential to facilitate healing on a spiritual level, as well as psychological benefits that last long after the primary experience ends.

Nice response. What is your prep or setting for this? Also what is a good starting dose and R.O.A. Is starting low and titrating the dose up gradually the way to approach this. 

Also if I recall I have heard this can be very 'moreish' like blacking out and totally going nuts with lines. That is the LAST thing I would ever want to happen.

Dissos are an acquired taste I guess. First time I tired MXE I dosed in the lowish range and was very disappointed. I just felt blank minded and intellectually disabled. 


After a couple of experiments I decided to just shelve it for a long time, until last year when I just though "Fuck it" and shoot for a large dose. I had a pretty amazing experience of melting into the music, and experiencing things I never though could be experienced, haha.


After that, I though that only hole-level doses were worthy, but honestly, I've been getting mildly psychedelic effects from lower dosages lately. As Vortech said, "unusual phenomenology": a completely distorted experience of senses and though process. 


I would suggest titrating up, anyway. Dissos usually allow themselves for redoses, but beware of the extended duration this carries with it. My favorite ROA seems to be sublingual nowadays, oral is fine too. Another thing I like is taking a medium dose nasally and a large oral one. The insufflated dose hits faster, and and hour later you'll be washed away by the oral dose. In my experience MXE is better enjoyed alone or with a close and trusted companion, a small group of friend at most. Dim illumination and heavily textured music is advised.

I like to lay out my dosage for the night (for you probably 40 or so mg) and break it into three lines, which I then insuflate over the course of an hour.


I like to be alone, in a comfy, central space with speakers pointed right at me. I always listen to weird electronic music on MXE, such as Boards of Canada and Stars of the Lid.


Have fun, you lucky son of a gun!

The virtues of stashing shit ;-) . 

Sound like a good idea to prep 3 lines out first.

It does seem that everyone who used to use it like really miss it I got enough problems and don't need to one with dissos.

 I guess the I'll dig deep into my music Library and try out beats antique, Russ liquid, the floozies, bassnectar, and some lettuce for the FUNK of it then play with stuff that goes BOOM  ![:-)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png).

^BoC isn't really what I'd call EDM. To be honest, it boarders on being creepy hahah, but that's why I like their music for MXE. MXE makes music sound odd, sometimes tinny, but it can be quite euphoric with the right music. Along with BoC and Stars of the Lid, I also frequent The Orb's albums for some of my mexxy trips. Really, go with what you find the most appealing. Personally I have an entire set of albums that I don't listen to on any other drug save for MXE, because I find that these artists' music is catered perfectly to a dissociated state and the weird aural effects produced by MXE.

^Hahahahah. I just love how haunting their music is on MXE. One time while I listened to their album "Geogaddi" I had an insane breakthrough which I believe was facilitated by their music.

I find MXE to be a hard one to pin down. It's been just over over three years since my first trials, and I have used intermittently throughout those three years. Space between uses has allowed for lack of tolerance build up. All dosages have been oral except in some cases when insufflation has been used, usually just for the fun of it. The first thing I've noticed is the potential for dysphoria. I think I've had an equal number of dysphoric experiences as I've had euphoric experiences on it. All of them have been in appropriate sets/settings. I can't quite find the confounding variable. Second thing I've noticed is that the same dosage will yield different subjective effects each time I dose. For example, in some cases 30-50mg gives me psychedelic headspace with unusual thought patterns, point of view displacement, and appreciation for art; other times the dosage will feel numbing and confusing with little other psychoactive activity. Some times I can feel quite healing thought patterns being produced, other times they tend toward the negative. Sometimes it relieves anxiety, other times it induces anxiety. 


Main thing I'd note is that MXE has very little inherent character of its own. It is best used to modulate other drugs. When I take MXE by itself I find the effects by turns dull, uninteresting, confusing, empty. For example, at low doses, I find it uninteresting because it mostly acts as a stimulant. Which is fine, but it's not what I'm looking for out of dissociatives. At high doses I mostly get confused and worried. On the other hand, my most positive experiences have come from combining it. Now here is where things with MXE's lack of inherent character get mouth-wateringly intriguing. Because you can make MXE do or be almost anything. For example, if you'd like a functional psychedelic high for the day, look no further than combining a micro-dose of LSD (maybe 10-20mcg) with a small dose of MXE and some cannabis. For more psychedelia, you can up the doses on either the LSD or the MXE, or both, but take note that functionality will quickly decrease as the dosages are increased and you can find yourself in a full-fledged trip pretty easily. Of course a full tripping dose of LSD combined with MXE is itself quite good, but some days just aren't meant to shatter your mind, so the micro-dose procedure is a nice middle ground for those who like getting psychedelic. 


I know this will not necessarily be a popular opinion but I find that MXE mixes great with alcohol and cannabis. And I'm not talking about one or two beers for the night, I'm talking about a night of drinking. The experience will be different depending on how much MXE you dose. I've found that dosing a small amount of MXE on a night of drinking can have excellent effects on sociability, euphoria, and energy. In this capacity it acts much like a stimulant, and I find it sharpens the drunken high and takes away that sickly element of being drunk. Dosing a full dose of MXE during a night of drinking is another beast altogether, but the combination is seriously euphoric and basically becomes a psychedelic drunkenness, particularly when mixed with plenty of cannabis. MXE preserves what I like about alcohol's psychoactive effects and minimizes the felt side-effects. Mind you, this combination is *severely dehydrating* and one should approach it with due caution. If I'm not careful with it I can have dehydration effects for a week afterward.  I would never advise anyone to mix alcohol and MXE in the way I do, as everyone needs to know their own limits and how they respond to drugs. Again, the combination is *severely dehydrating* and so appropriate cautions should be taken. 


Anyway, these have been some of my findings with MXE. I originally delved into MXE with the intention of using it in a more entheogenic fashion but I have simply not found it to be a useful material in that regard. It never gives me too much insight into anything, except when mixed with mushrooms but then I just assume it's mostly the mushrooms.

I've had batches of MXE that seemed dull and uninteresting on their own but still made a great combo with other drugs, as well as batches of MXE that are pure magic on their own.  MXE is a strange beast, I am convinced there is something going on with different batches having a different range of effects.  I generally relegate such perceived differences to placebo effect, but since the different batches I've experienced also have a different appearance and taste, while all still testing positive as MXE, I think polymorphism of the molecule may play a role.  After all, it's been shown that an AIDS medication (I think it's an AIDS medication, I can't be bothered right now to dig this reference up) that is polymorphic is only effective in one of its forms.  To me this proves it's possible for the specific crystal structure of a substance to change the effects, in substances that are able to form various crystal structures (ie, are polymorphic).

I find any batch of MXE to be hit or miss at times. Sometimes I feel it's impossible to guarantee a good experience out of it, but I do think I get mostly positive in overall numbers. I dunno, it's a weird drug, that's probably why I love it. I find having a similar set and setting each time helps to create the experience I desire more consistently.


I also find that with more frequent use, the effects are more consistent and enjoyable.

For what it's worth, I've basically been using the same batch for the last two years and even then it's hit or miss. My only assumption, not being one for metaphysical musings, is that it has more to to do with diet/tolerance than we realize. My set and setting is essentially a constant throughout my experiences - my bed, Friday/Saturday night.


I've tried oral/nasal/both and it seems that each time I'm rolling the die between a beautiful experience and something uninspiring. 


I plan on lining out 250mg for insufflating this Friday night. It's been since May 27th since I've had a dissociative due to my recent hexen/2fa/4fa experimentation, but that seems to be taking a toll on my heart (I admit it might be purely psychological), so I want to give that a rest this weekend.

blue_applesauce, I definitely think you're right about tolerance playing a huge role in the type of experience MXE gives, or any disso for that matter really. 


I'm one of the unfortunates that wound up with the long term tolerance issues so am a bit more sensitive to this phenomenon, maybe? 


Whenever I hear people talk about "dark mxe" I tend to think they're experiencing some tolerance issues because the same batch that felt amazing for me ends up feeling a lot different once I've used up my small amount of dissociative credits for that period of time. It's not exclusively a decrease in effects I'm referring to, but generally a change in tone of the experiences. 


I don't think people realize how quickly tolerance dulls the magic of these substances, and it's like any other substance, the more space you have between sessions - the more likely it is to give you that sparkle. My perfect pattern of use would ideally be a handful of times a year.

There was a time where I thought there was such a thing as dark mxe and light mxe. However, those theories were quickly dismissed with further research. I adjusted the verbiage to say there are only dark experiences and light experiences, and the material, while it is one componant, is only a slice of all the variables in determining the nature or outcome of the experience. The material itself is best categorized in a way that allows more than one characteristic along a spectrum of black/white. Metaphorically it is more of a color scale in addition to a luminance scale. From that perspective our state of mind and environment can duly be characterized by this sort of dynamic color and luminance scale, so as you can imagine the predictability becomes a bit difficult when all these colors are mixed together, but sometimes the stars align, and equal levels of green, blue and red are mixed together to create a perfect white lightness. 


As for the tolerance factor, the essence, or spirit (or magic), can still be tapped into regardless of tolerance. The way and ease of accessing it, and the quality of the reception (qualia) will change and evolve with continued use for any number of reasons- psychological, physiological or spiritual shifts in lifewave tuning result from overusing MXE without a period of returning to an organic or baseline level of tuning. There is a sweet spot in tolerance in which desired tuning is most easily accessed. Too low tolerance and it is difficult to control, but once you have tuned successfully many times, theres only so much more tuning that can be achieved (because you are already there) so the perceived effect will be diminished.


Sorry for ramble its early morning.

Plugged 30mg mxe earlier.


Just has something I do not get from K , o pce, 3 meo. A little bit of magic that just makes everything seem allright. 


Tinfoil hat and all, but something about universe cops checkin me after feeling as if I stumbled  into places I wasnt expected to be (no not from 30mg, it did happen more than once though) makes me wonder why this really dissappeared.

I hope this doesn't count as vendor discussion, but what keeps chemists to synth MXE in countries where it is still legal? I heard the synth is similar to ketamine, but with either one less step or one more. It's a big golden treasure and nobody seems to be wanting to open it? Why is that? Are the compounds to expensive? I bet there are many people that are willing to pay prices up to 100$/g for some good new MXE. Can anyone fill?

MXE is a strange beast, I am convinced there is something going on with different batches having a different range of effects.  I generally relegate such perceived differences to placebo effect, but since the different batches I've experienced also have a different appearance and taste, while all still testing positive as MXE, I think polymorphism of the molecule may play a role.  After all, it's been shown that an AIDS medication (I think it's an AIDS medication, I can't be bothered right now to dig this reference up) that is polymorphic is only effective in one of its forms.  To me this proves it's possible for the specific crystal structure of a substance to change the effects, in substances that are able to form various crystal structures (ie, are polymorphic).

well I don't know about the crystal structure of MXE in solid state, but when a compound like that is in solution, they will be solvated completely, and, in aqueous solution (ie blood) will be surrounded by mostly water molecules (there are 3 sites on MXE which can form hydrogen bonds). to me, as a chemistry student, this polymorphism stuff sound highly unlikely.


maybe there is something going on with enantiomer ratio in different batches. mxe is a chiral molecule after all.

Yeah I'm sure it has to do more with enantiomer ratio. Not polymorphism. This has actually even been gone over and the polymorphism idea was tossed awhile ago.

^ well different enantiomers might have different pharmacological profiles (ie ketamine, amphetamine,...). so a varying enantiomer ratio might bring about different effects from batch to batch, even if they all test as pure MXE. analysing a batch for enantiomer ratio is more work so I guess it's not being done...

I'm sorry help, I literally snooted 60mg last night. I know I know, it's a crime 8( but in my experience, it works well for giving me my desired effects.


I finally understand what vortech means by 'tuning' though! The way you have to dose multiple days in a shorter period and mentally 'tune' to affect the outcome of the experience, to transform it into what you desire out of it. At least I think that's what you mean vortech? Either way, I dosed Wed. then Sat. and Sat.'s experience was much better and more 'tuned' to what I desired. It seems if I don't have any built up in my system, I end up with an unsatisfying experience, such as last Wed. for me.

Yeah bullshit! Good selling point though! Ahhh 240! It'd make me mad normally but with the absence?!? Seriously dude? Just eat it and wait 20-49 minute to get a hundred times more awesome effect!

Next time I'll give it a try orally. The one time I tried oral dosing was quite a while back, and I wound up extremely queasy for some reason, so it really turned me off. I also like the stimulating nature of it.

I eventually settled on oral too, but plugging is was always the best way.  Just got tired of the prep work and sticking oral syringes where they don't belong.


I saw someone IV a hefty dose once, never IVed myself but it was crazy to see them come up.  There was a good 2-5 minute delay between when they IVed it and when it hit them.  Maybe he missed but he was pretty experienced with the ROA and usually said something when he did.


When it did finally hit them I had to guide them to a bed and they were in a hole for a long time.  It was a pre-ban batch, good stuff, wish I still had some of it.  MXE was like the perfect drug shame it's so hit or miss now with the new batches, haven't bought any in years because it just seems like such a hassle to find anything worth getting.  Last two times I've been offered MXE I was given some random disso RC.

Asante once did an experiment on sublingual MXE:

I tried the same experiment (15 minutes with complete spit-out and mouth washing) and the effects very definitely above placebo, but they were **much much** weaker than oral, confirming the finding by Asante that only a **tiny** fraction of MXE is absorbed this way.


The disadvantages (holding it under the tongue for 15min) are far bigger than the advantages (the **microscopic** amount of MXE that is absorbed faster than orally)


conclusion: oral is incredibly **easy** (compared to sublingual), it's incredibly **safe** (compared to injections), and it's **all one needs!

Thats kind of weird. I've been consistently getting a faster and stronger comeup dosing sublingually. Like... substantially faster, when I consume it orally I never get anything until more or less 40 minutes, sublingually I start feeling something in 15 minutes, and Im already dissociated in 30

It's been a long while since I've had mxe.. tried several other dissociatives but none came remotely close to the magic of mxe. Over the years I've used mxe at outrageous doses and enjoyed many month long stretches of blissed out mania on the stuff. It's the greatest chemical to pass these lips, in my opinion. Anyway, earlier today I'm doing some belated spring cleaning and I come across a forgotten mxe stash, a mere 350mg but to someone like me who holds the chemical in such high regard it was like winning the lottery. I know I can't wait so I spend all day prepping, go to the store and get groceries, do all my errands, etc, etc, etc so tomorrow can be freed up. Showered and got my playlists ready, took 100mg to start (all doses orally), holed like a motherfucker, took another 100mg about 90 minutes later (holed even harder, came out of it with tears of euphoria in my eyes) then did a final 150mg dose 2 hours after that and blew the roof off my brain in the best possible way. It's been about 3 hours since I returned to earth and all I can do is sit here and marvel at what I just experienced. Nothing can compare.


Honestly, I'd give a pinky and a thumb for a kilo of mxe. I cannot put into words how incredible this chemical is. I've toyed with all types of chemicals for 20 years now but dissociatives have always been the PhD class of drugs to me, a class of drugs meant for correction, understanding and expanding, and in that class MXE sets the curve. The stuff just gets better and better the more you use it, a true tool to leapfrog ahead in all aspects of life. Such a crime/shame/mystery that it's nonexistent these days. At least I have this gorgeous afterglow to slither around in for a few more hours, and that long lasting positive lingering for the next few days that mxe always leaves me with.

It does depend on the batch, and i will agree on an empty stomach oral is at least as good or better than sub, but after a meal sub is the way to do it

I dunno... I still have some, haven't touched it in a month.  When I had a little more I was using it a little more often, but honestly I just don't want to be dissociated all the time.

Back in 11-12' I was ordering 10g at a time


I'd get my bag and within a week I'd be calling my buddy saying you gotta come over and take this away or I'm gonna end up divorced 


Then within a week id be calling him back like GIVE mE MY StASH BACK!!


But honestly I never even went nuts with the stuff like some people I keep reading about....over a year of use and I only holed a handful of times....but I loved taking it orally around 20-30mg every 2-3 hours for an evening

I never used MXE more than a few nights in a row because after that it felt like it was losing magic fast. I think my MXE usage was somewhat in normal limits but with 3-MeO-PCP I dosed several nights a week for months. But it's weird because after those MXE binges I remember feeling more drained than after more excessive 3meo use.. I miss MXE for sure, its been over a year since I had some.

At the moment I am using 3meo on a daily schedule for the last 5 days, it does a great job of doing what it does and fills in that hole that left me when MXE became scarce. I'm actually at a really beautiful balance right now, where there is plenty of magic all around me and I feel everything is working as it should. The 3meo has tuned me in a way where everything just feels so perfect, and I am guided by my intuition. Allwaysbreathefreshare.

man I was ordering 100g at a time. mainly because of group buys with friends but shit I miss those days. Last week mxe popped up on darknet @ about $50/g due to somebody having found a 160g batch. I remember having so much at one point but it quickly vanished when I began toying with how big I could make the crystals and vaping the freebase.

Obviously not from personal experience, but from the structural similarities with ketamine it should last much more than 100 years!


In other news: I had a **huge** tolerance, took a **6 month break**, and the magic was back!


So it takes a **looooong** time, but at least the tolerance isn't permanent (like some people thought in this thread).

I just don't understand how no one else is synthing it anywhere. There is still a huge market, both gray (in the US mostly) and black (Europe and others). Plus there are still plenty of countries with lax manufacturing laws where it is still not illegal. I know there are labs in Spain and Ukraine among others pumping RCs out, why do none of them produce MXE? 


Makes no sense to me when there is so much money to be made. Is the synthesis just that difficult?

i prefer o-pce since it's  more sedating but can see why some people don't


and while 3-meo-pce + o-pce is close mxe had a better p/p

I've been holding on to what little MXE I have left, about half a gram, for quite some time now. Figured if it was going to make a comeback it would have happened by now, but still my hopes are high. O-pce sounds promising, sedation is good.


Never seriously considered trying any of the other dissos out currently but perhaps I shall.

I never tried it but was always curious.


I know we aren't usually supposed to ask legality questions but I thought it was legal or technically an RC you could still order so why is everyone saying they "miss it"??

It is legal, but ever since the Europe and China bans quality dropped then production seemingly ceased to exist. Nobody knows where to get it from what I can tell, at least not on the clearnet, and if they do they're keeping it to themselves, which I can't blame them for.

It's the beez kneez mannnn. Though honestly, MXE coulda become it's own drug independent of what the illegal movement is. But here we are, suckin our own dicks, wishin MXE would come along.


Hey if you've got any "I love MXE sentiment" please direct it to one of our PD social threads. This is supposed to be a thread about MXE istelf and not how much we miss it.

So many people want MXE and it holds its own vs Ketamine.. Methoxetamine has what it takes to cross over to the black market. It has great properties that make it just about the perfect dissociative. There were sites out there with 10 kilo quantities in the catalog. This drug was used by MANY people, it was a huge market. Many, like I, preferred it over Ketamine.


This drug needs to be brought back.


Just like 2C-B has found its way to the black market, this one should also. It's got what it takes. 15-50 doses to a gram, you can use it orally, nasally, rectally, by injection, it lasts several hours, is less prone to bladder problems, no watched precursors, you can party OR hole on it, it is forgiving of high doses and binges, It's got what it takes.

It will make a comeback I believe. The issue will be the price though. 


Having too much good quality mxe in my stash and little self control usually leads to flushing it. Sadly, the last of my stash went that way. Still kicking myself.

I've never experienced the flushing of the mxe phenomenon that seems to be a trend with so many people. MXE was never a moreish substance for me personally. Even when I was low dosing it daily for a couple months there I never had issues with taking a break or getting out of control with it. My ex got rid of a couple grams of high quality once though out of spite...it's been well over a year and that still hurts me inside ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png) she said she buried it somewhere in the field we lived next to...who does that?!

I've never flushed any.  I find 3-MeO-PCP more compulsive than MXE.  I still have a bit of MXE, haven't touched it in months.  For some reason it doesn't really pull at me even though I love it.

Maybe so


But the first time was me dumping around 6-7grams down the kitchen sink because my wife at the time walked in and hated it


The 90 grams was when I went to rehab...she flushed around $12,000 street value shit from my closet

guys keep doing it, keep praying to the goddess of fun for a bit drug; i am sure with your insistence your prayers will be heard and a secret drive will be installed in the heart and mind of great chemist who will churn out tons of the stuff.

Add me among those who has flushed MXE. Did it probably 5-6 times, totaling more than 200 grams in all. I binged on over a gram a day for nearly a year and had quite a few 'episodes' where I was done, flushed the stash only to order more a few hours later. God I miss that beautiful drug. Nothing else comes remotely close. Anyone who says otherwise.. bless your heart.

I flushed a little over half a gram of the best MXE I ever ended up getting my hands on because it was so good I ended up skipping class and taking it a little too often at times and my grades were suffering. Not long after that I decided to quit school to learn trade skills and am kicking myself for not having the self control to just quit taking that MXE and hang onto it for the future. So it's Great stuff. I miss it dearly.

I am frankly amazed that this has become so hard to find.  Back in the good old days when it was so cheap and easy to get I assumed that if it ever became illegal or hard to find that someone would take the chance to produce and supply it through the typical black market.  Every type of user I let try any always loved it, didn't matter if they were into alcohol, benzos, opioids, speed, cocaine, just smoked weed..whatever.  All of them loved it and said they did for different reasons more often then not.  It seemed like the perfect drug too...no hangover, no withdrawal (at first anyway).  Even though you'd get in the habit of always taking some a little too often you couldn't really give yourself a good reason not to.  It wasn't like all those other "bad drugs" that I had been doing and trying to kick..hell it was helping me kick those drugs!


A digital drug revolution if you will, a drug for the 21st century.  The next generations LSD or MDMA.


I remain hopeful that it will make a return and even though I was spoiled on the "good stuff" before the first bans I'll happily buy as much of it as I can just in case we ever see a drought again.  It is just so special that I can't stand not having the option of using it or turning someone on to it for the first time.  Having a large stash seems like a very bad idea it's just so damn magical that I'm willing to risk keeping one around.  I really do hope the party isn't over for good and I hate myself for wasting the last bit of what I had watching the fucking Hobbit in 3D.

Cue conspiracy theories that this drug is a threat to the Establishment in a way that may be even more powerful than the threat LSD posed in the 60s. Like you said it would displace so many other drugs,but it does needs some level of control, and protocols for proper use. Black market is not the way to go, it would only create more problems and funnel more emoney into illicit trade. It is valuable to many sectors that could profit if they chose to evolve.everything from mental health, even physical health in specific situations, psyhology, addiction management and recovery, and adjunct to pain managemebt, and not to mention a huge threat to the alcohol cartel. A drink with 20 mg mxe I would take any day over a drink of alcohol.

Luckily for LSD enough was produced back the dat to feed the world for a life time (so the story goes according to 'the family').


It was almost as if the Etablishment bought up all the stock of the good stuff, flooded the market with low quality material and then banned it with fake stories. A couple good vendors and labs kept going till the end, but there is something fishy about how it went down. Not to mention how the dude **snip**, the most righteous of vendors who treated rightly MXE as a molecular sacrament and limited the amount a parishioner could receive in a month 'commited suicide' this February. We had contact in December about the MXE book and had plans reintroduce educational material on how to best use it, and nothing led me to believe he was depressed.

But it may be true MXE is TOO GOOD, 'The Man' simply banned it with Good intentions. But if that was true why the hell is 3meo-pcp so incredibly cheap and abundant right now, an inarguably MUCH more dangerous analogue.too hot to handle. Also DCK. It destroys intestinal flora. IT DOESNT MAKE SENSE.

i seem to be in a relatively small minority who found MXE never really agreed with them, I had some fun times on it but it definitely never lived up to the hype bestowed on it by others and i found it to have some weird physical side effects, strangely my one exception to this was a time when i took a smallish dose, drank a few beers and watched american horror story: coven, never been so immersed in something!

Maybe it was the alcohol? I find it improves any dissociative for me by a lot, mostly in social settings. MXE is a peculiar one though, in that there are so many ways it can go. But there's always a particular dose that suits you just right. I find high doses a little hectic sometimes, more so than 3-MeO-PCP (though I'm less insane), but low-mid dose has given me so much joy.


Just talking about it makes me miss it. That said, a high oral dose of 3-MeO-PCE + a tryptamine psychedelic and the aforementioned Ketamine + 3-Meo-PCP combo have completely taken it's place and both are much better for me. I didn't have too many MXE experiences though, so maybe there is a magic in high doses that I haven't experienced myself. You know, a bit like learning to appreciate bitter tastes like coffee, at first you don't understand why anyone likes it but after a while it's amazing. Now my coffee can't be dark enough!

This was true for me, my first trials with MXE left me thinking "WTF? This drug is just making me feel retarded", but then I upped the dose untill reaching a hole and it was crazy, one of my best drug experiences. After that I though MXE was only worthile in hole-level dosages, but after "getting" what it had to offer I came to also appreciate the magic of the lower dosages. Now I can take like 10 mg and have a great time. 


I also don't think I would have instantly loved 3-MeO-PCP if I hadn't experimented with MXE before.

I've had the best holes on MXE, alcohol and cannabis. It was my favorite combo and I think it still is. The synergy is amazing and I think I had my first and maybe only synaesthesia experience with this combo. It's like the holy trinity.


Be careful though, you don't need a lot of alcohol for this.

I had the exact same experience with MXE.  My initial trials I didn't really like... it made me feel stupid and uncomfortable.  Then I took a hole-level dose and had an amazing experience that blew away any ketamine hole-level experience I've ever had, and from then on any dose has been good.

I liked low dosages of MXE from the very start, we were very careful with it when I got my first gram and were basically just doing bumps over the course of a night/morning.  The only bad thing was we were hiding the fact that we were doing something other than smoking pot from my friend's girlfriend and she hung around most of the night instead of going to bed like she planned.  It was really hard to maintain in front of her because we were re-dosing every time she left the room for a little while.  I kept trying to focus on playing Mario kart online and would snap back to reality just running into walls.  I still managed to win a few races, no idea how I did that.


Anyway, once I got brave and holed for the first time that was the only thing I wanted to do with MXE from then on.  I holed a bunch of times with it when I was keeping it around.  Eventually I got to the point where it made me feel retarded and manic so I slowed down and didn't order anymore.  I appreciate low doses now since that's usually the only time I get to taste it but if someone gifts me enough to hole I'm always going to shoot for one.  I just love drifting in my head with the music driving everything, it's such a wonderful experience and I always feel refreshed and at ease when I come back.  It was a really useful substance when I was kicking my heavy opioid habit, if it weren't for MXE I'd probably still be railing them every day.

That's pretty typical from a good dose of almost any dissociative drug.

I came very late to this party. Some did appear last week and I managed to secure a gram before it all sold (very quickly). Waiting on its arrival now.


I don't really do the dissociative on their own that much. I have some K which I generally use after the Peak of a trip on tryptamines,  phens or LSD (k after an AL-LAD peak is heavenly).


Generally go for IM as I'm not keen on snorting (and it seems a waste on this according to reports) so I think a 15mg shot to test the waters is in order. 


Of course, no idea of the quality yet, but will report back on the experience when I get round to it.

I read one report that alleged it may be cut with caffeine, but it is all hearsay at this point. My guess it is leftover from the last batch that was a 70:30 MXE to caffeine ratio. If it was actually a new synth I imagine there would be more availability and reports. I'll be honest, I felt a bit of nostalgia recently for the days when legit MXE was available. For now it is still a memory. There is a rumor that at least one lab in India is working on it. Again, just rumor which I am sure most of us are tired of, given the one year anniversary of its disappearance and countless rumors that never materialized since then.

Yeah I'm getting effing sick of this. People STFU unless you have concrete stuff. I'm not trying to be rude, I'm trying to express the frustration and disappointment I feel at hearing these rumors only to find out they're just that, rumors. Unless you just snooted some legit MXE and came here to praise it's holy name, then please, refrain from sending us all on a gosh darned emotional roller-coaster.

Received my MXE on Friday. Appearance is nearly pure white and quite clumpy so seems to match reports of some previous batches. 

Didn't have time to test fully this weekend, but an IM dose of 5mg was very gentle as you'd expect. An hour later I IMed another 5mg + 18mg of Ket (last of my stash hence odd dose!). I'm careful with my ket use so 18mg gave me a very nice high and after it wore off I had a very pleasant glow which I suspect was produced by the MXE.


On another note, I was watching Volcano on the sci-fi channel during the trip and was utterly engrossed. There can't be many movies cornier than that! I found myself able to almost exactly anticipate everything the characters were going to say and do (probably as much to do with the predictability of the movie as with the MXE/ket). IT left me thinking that if Tommy Lee Jones can stop a volcano from destroying LA by using a few highway barriers then I can help to stop the spread of xenophobia in the UK!

The only MXE I've seen advertised on the DW is from china and the last shit i got from China...pre-ban...was just that...shit, yellow shit.

I have seen it advertised recently in small amounts a gram or less at a pop. What is the definitive test for it?


I don't want to end up with a bunch of DCK instead.

A question on duration and IM. 

There are too many posts on MXE on here to get an idea of what I am looking for!

Anyway, I have little to no tolerance (total of 10mg IM on Friday plus 18mg Ket). How long, roughly, would you expect the effects of around 20mg IM to last? Would 8 hours be enough time to return to baseline? I'm having trouble finding answers WRT duration.

With just MXE I found that I was mostly to baseline within 5 hours. IM probably 3.5-4 I'd guess.

Yeah, 8 hours is the best HR advice, but with IM it is even shorter than a 4 hour duration. To be safe, an additional half life or two should bring you very close to baseline at T+8:00.

Yeah I never use gel caps for dosing drugs, as it never hits me as well.  I just put the powder in my mouth and wash it down with water, it's just a little bitterness.  In the case of MXE, it doesn't even have much taste.  But certainly using a thin rolling paper or something is still better than gel caps.

If you put a gel cap into a cup of water it will pretty much dissolve in a few minutes.... think what tge hcl acid in your stomach will do to thst gel cap.

Very very strange that anybody is finding Gel capsules delay the onset other don't work at all.

Anything I take orally is in a gel cap and I've never noticed any diminished effects in over 20 years of using capsules.

They really don't dissolve quickly nor release the carried substance all at once.

Yes but the fact that it releases slowly means that the material can get "lost" or "stuck" in other material in your stomach and not be absorbed through your stomach lining.


I'm not making on argument on gel caps working or not. I'm simply making an observation that based on personal experience and videos such as what I linked, gel caps can be unreliable to the point of the drug never being absorbed. Three times myself I've had that happen. Back in high school when I was giving stuff to friends two friends took 2C-E capped and never felt anything. As well as the first time I tripped, I was with my best friend, we went out into the countryside, each took 25mg of 4-AcO-DMT capped, and then sat by a river for 4-5 hours. We didn't talk whatsoever so I didn't find out until I felt it was time to go that he'd never felt more than the weed that we smoked at the very beginning. I'd tripped and he hadn't at all. Thirty minutes later we've just left Sonic where he's gotten a milkshake and within 15 minutes of us still driving around roadie'ing he begins to trip.


You can argue all you want but it is empirically unreliable.

Dissolving MXE in water has the strongest and fastest come-up of oral methods,  on an empty stomach.  I always loved dosing a moderate amount an hour before dinner (Edit, it was more like 30-45 minutes on second thought, by T+1:00 things get pretty intense for the concept of food).  The energy from the dinner really grounds the experience at the peak leading to a very glowing shamanic sort of meditative effect. 


I also noticed a few bites of a spicy food like cayenne pepper makes sublingual hit fast and hard.

Yeah all I can say is, I used to use gel caps and still have on occasion, and I always notice that just putting the powder in my mouth produces a much quicker and more reliable absorption.

First trial using MXE combined with another psychedlic. The only way I can describe it is [utter dysphoria and utter bliss](https://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads/807290-4-HO-MET-MXE-Ketamine-Weed-Experienced-Dysphoric-Bliss?p=13834572#post13834572). Really not sure I like MXE at all (Assuming it is MXE of course).

You guys are all a bunch of cock teases.

MXE is dead until it's back for the USA & EU, but not at 5 times the price it was originally sold.

Just let her go.


For now, it's over.

I too can find MXE in the EU. I friend of mine bought it last April and we analysed and tried it and everything was good. Then I ordered in May and the powder look much more fluffy but I send it for testing and they found MXE and nothing else. Haven't tried yet as I am miles away. I can still see it listed in same website.

I miss low doses of MXE (oral dosing, dissolve in warm water in a shot glass) on a lazy saturday/sunday morning. Smoking weed and just walking around outside/watching cartoons take on a religious significance. Like your home is a temple for one's self.

That off white/yellowish sandy/granular textured MXE from 2014-2015?

If so most of that stuff was bunk. Test results showed just MXE but made me feel like shit, as well as every other dissociative user that I shared that batch with. And most people always loved MXE if it was the quality I'd get in 2012-2013. Very fine, white crystalline powder. The taste was barely noticeable, but the yellowish sandy textured MXE tasted like salt. Very disophoric, nauseating, and no magic.

So, this might sound strange, but I've never actually read my own book from beginning to end, until this weekend, one year after I started sharing the draft version with some people here. 


It was a good read! Also quite more dense than I realized! But a good recrystallization of the information into my consciousness for reflection. It is quite a journey, going the whole way through. I'm actually still not finished, but I will get there tonight.


I had a particularly note-worthy breakthrough experience on 3-meo-pcp yesterday, a day after combining ephenidine and 3meo-pce, which broke a 2-month hiatus from all dissociatives. I have started writing a trip report of it, in between breaks from reading the book. I'm in dissociative heaven the last 3 days!

I dont know, the best MXE I ever had is clumpy powder. white to off white yellowish


This mxe is granular pretty euforic and dissociative but no psychedelia and no magic, no profound revelations, no inner visions


Permatolerance? why? I want to feel the same that I felt years ago in 2014 when I saw a shamanic ritual in my bed, and all the stars and planets coming to me.


maybe Im going to redose and mix with some vaped cannabis.

Yeah it sounds like you're talking about the sandy/granular MXE with a yellowish tint. It's quite hard to hole on that batch if it is the same as im thinking. There was some sent to ecstasydata that looked just like the batch I believe we're talking about. But yeah, only the white crystalline MXE ever gave me the magic or super easy, euphoric, and spiritual hole experiences. Same for others I know who have tried both batches as well.

So how went that ephenidine + 3-meo-pce combo and in what dosages? I have those two motherfuckers ready to fire up, and this week it's time for my now only-once-a-month disso use. I was trying to choose between those two, but now you make me want to do a combo ^^

It was more like I did a tad of 3meopce, then a couple hours later dosed some ephenidine, then a few hours later did some more ephenidine, and then a couple hours later dosed 3meopce again, and then rode that out instead of sleeping for a night (I slept well the next night). It was more of a temporal sandwich than a combo. But yeah, it was fun. And it set me up for my 3-meo-pcp breakthrough experience that I will forever have trouble putting into words but will never forget because it was so incredible.

Veodo, yep. Looks to be the batch that I've been referring to. I didn't care for it, nor did any friends that tried that batch.

Trialled another 25mg MXE plugged yesterday. It was very pleasant, and I did enjoy it. Clearly will need to take a bigger dose when I have more time to see what all the fuss is about!

On another note, it does seem to go rather well with ketamine. I got hold of some medicinal ket in proper vials. IM administration of just 10mg K about two hours into the MXE trip had quite a profound effect. I didn't hole as such, but certainly had a great ride! 

Of course, pure K is likely to be much more potent than the usual stuff anyway.


For the MXE I have dissolved 250mg in 10ml of sterile water, passed it through a micron filter and it is now in a sterile vial. Much better for controlling dosage and allows for IM or plugged administration.

Still, 10mg of pure K on its own is a very low dosage.  I haven't combined MXE with ketamine, but I have with 3-MeO-PCP a few times, and they wildly potentiate each other.

The sense of smell is so enhanced by MXE. Glass of whisky sitting on table about five feet away almost feels like it is being insufflated!

I know what you mean about the smell. I came up walking around the neighborhood one spring and the smell of the cut grass was almost overwhelming. Pleasant but a little more INTENSE than it had ever seemed before. Like a chemical scream.

Received some supposed MXE this week which I'm testing out. A bit suspicious as the substance I've got does not dissolve well into water.  Despite using boiling water to try to make a solution I was still left with a suspension. I did an allergy test using 3mg with no issues.

Mixed 35mg into water, passed through a micron filter to remove the suspended particles and then consumed rectally. 


It feels like MXE, but I do wonder about the solubility. It was sold as pre-ban MXE so it could have degraded I suppose, buy I wouldn't expect that to affect solubility. Am now waiting on my new reagent testing kit to confirm substance.

Tested batch of known MXE with Marquis and received the expected pinkish reaction.

New batch had some pink, but much less which leads me to conclude that it is cut with something. I guess if I disslove out the MXE and then pass the solution through a filter then I can extract it judging by the light trip I had previously. Makes it difficult to judge dosing though!


Suppose I could take leave in a container to evaporate a known quantity  of the liquid and then weight how much substance is left at the end.

LOL so I took a chance today and the results feel very nice. I found an old snooter (a bic pen emptied and used for insufflating and vaporizing drugs), and I vaped a lot of MXE back in the day with this thing, so it had a lot of yellow-orange-ish residue in it. I scraped what was basically the MXE equivalent of weed resin and took all of it orally with some energy drink, it was 100+mg of material by the look of it. 90 minutes later, I'm pleasantly surprised! It is reminiscent of MXE, maybe it is a metabolite or some kind of Frankenstein molecule that has some relation to MXE. Whatever happens to the molecule when it is vaporized, can anyone here answer the question? Its a nice buzz anyway.

Took me a bit of experimentation, but I've finally got to grips with this stuff.


On Wednesday I plugged 75mg of the lower quality MXE (I won't inject it as I don't know what it is cut with). As expected this gave a pleasant buzz (not surprising as a fair quantity is insoluble and is filtered out). I then went ahead and added 50mg of good quality MXE via IM about 20 minutes later. The next thing I know I'm simply in bliss. Everything is rather fuzzy after the IM administration, but I know that I felt fantastic without really knowing why. Blissful confusion I guess I would call it.


So, strengthened by this experience i went one further last night. I had a high dose acid night (allegedly 800ug, but you can never tell). After about 8 hours I was still flying (having repeatedly dosed k over the hours) and went for a 35mg MXE shot. All I can say is wow! I was in a total other dimension. The liquid visuals of the acid trip combined with the 'rotary' effect of MXE was utterly wonderful. I went further on this combination than I ever have on any substance. Definitely not for the faint hearted: a big part of living this trip was the mantra 'don't fight it feel it' and this really worked for me. Absolutely no anxiety throughout the acid trip (actually, I added 100ug eth lad and 125 ald52 for good measure), and the euphoria was immense. I was raised up on a plinth with white light shining down as I was bombarded by feelings of love and warmth. I mean literally, the bed (for i could do nowt but lie prostrate) rose up to the ceiling as images circled around my vision.


Awesome trip, but have to say that it was nearly 16 hours after first dropping the cid that I was able to function effectively so much recovery time is needed. Perhaps a once on a year experience with plenty of planning.


I'm left with a sore face as I've just been grinning ever since.

I believe that pure MXE should have a colorless reaction. I used to have some cheap MXE and it [went red](https://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads/675526-Red-MXE-Marquis-Reaction), but EcstacyData says that MXE should be clear.


Also, wow, that's a lot of acid you took. Did you have a tolerance when you took it? Surprised it wasn't stronger

whats the most similar dissociative to MXE in terms of threshold dosing mxe for antidepressant.  3meo and k are the only other things ive tried and didn't cut it as a depression med. mxe has always been a literally life saving medication in this regard to me.

Yeah I haven't tried any of the new dissociatives since MXE but 3-MeO-PCE has sounded like the best bet for something close. I've been following along with all the updates and information on the newer dissociatives but only 3-MeO-PCP, 3-MeO-PCE and 2-Fluoro-Ketamine have peaked my interest. Haven't been able to source any of them due to high prices or bitcoin only being accepted though, sadly. MXE is gone, but not forgotten for the time being it seems.

Yes, it was pretty far out. I should have added that there was some tolerance there.  I had 200ug eth-lad + 125ug ald52 trip five days before. That was so intense I found myself having to use some xanax for the first time. I was quite annoyed with myself! 

So, I went big and used ketamine shots (25mg IM) from the 90 minute mark to keep it under control and it worked perfectly. 


The addition of the MXE was intense. I was lying there and my internal dialogue seemed to be sorting through the filing system in my mind. At one point it felt as if it had gone up to the attic. I remember being told that I was searching for something, but the problem with the attic is that everything gets dumped there so it's very hard to find what you are looking for. Lots of memories were being tossed around and at one point it almost felt like a cupboard was opened and a load of memories fell out into my everyday brain (if that makes sense?). I kept thinking about myself in the third person and was perfectly comfortable with this. My mindset in approaching this trip was 'don't fight it, feel it' and I totally accepted everything that was happening. 


The issue with the previous, partially abored,  trip was not to do with worry over being stuck in the mindset; rather it felt as though I couldn't feel my breathing was not under control and that my heart was racing. I know this not to be the case, but it was very uncomfortable hence the xanax.

It has been mentioned in this thread by several, especially Xorcoth that snorting MXE produces a more stimmy and less psychedelic/dissociative high.   Does anyone believe its due to just a poorer bioavailablilty by this route (compared to oral/rectal)?   Or is it just a different effect for some other reason?  Like if i took a lesser dose of MXE orally is the effect the same as snorting a larger dose?

No insufflation provides more stimulation with toned down dissaciation. Oral and rectal is the opposite.

thats why I like insufflation so much more, I mainly use it as an antidepressant at low doses.   plus i just like snorting stuff.


I also found IV to lack that organic "rolly" feel that oral and rectal have.   It was more like snorting.  Except the psychedelic/visuals were ever present but the body high was similar to snorting

I haven't tried oral but once years back. Might have to give it another go... I love snooting MXE though, easiest drug on the nose ever. Plus the stimulation in low doses is quite pleasant.

what are the chances this drug will ever become mainstream even though its illegal...kind of like how pcp or mdma are illegal but are mainstream and produced on large scales?


it seems like its definitely in a class above all other RCs as far as fan base

It's not even illegal everywhere. Id have to guess it will. It became hugely popular during it's reign. Many people liked it just as much as ketamine if not more, myself included. Like said a million times, if someone could just produce a good amount it would probably make a come back.

Does anyone else feel that MXE permanently changed their diet for the better? My GF and I have both noticed this as a long-lasting effect of MXE. I consume almost no processed foods or meat anymore and I get lots of fruits, vegetables. I used to always get really conscious of how poor my everyday diet was during MXE sessions and these thoughts trickled over into everyday life, now I can't eat any other way.

I think that if you go into it with the intention of making a personal change, MXE can be a real facilitator of that.  Probably someone going into it with only recreation in mind and no desire to change their diet is not going to get that effect.  In other words, I don't think MXE contains the property of making people want to eat better.  I think it just makes it easier (if used in an appropriate manner) to be able to make changes to yourself.

When I was taking ephenidine in the summer quite a lot I felt that it completely altered my approach to food, for the better. It made me very concerned with eating predominantly for health and flavour, as opposed to greed/amount/junk food. Kept the good (food) habit up for a few months as well, but slipped during a benzo withdrawal. 


It always amazes me that this country was *flooded* with MXE back in 2011~, and that I never really had any interest in experimenting. 


To me it was just the bogeyman which replaced our ketamine supply for a while, and induced a couple of unexpected and sketchy holes resulting from sniffing huge lines at parties. I can still remember about 8 people escorting me and my friend back from a party. People always describe it as kind of like a care in the community type thing, trying to escort two big man-children along bustling streets whilst we repeatedly made strange gestures and stumbled around asking what the fuck was going on. ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

Not sure how international law works but it's been added to the list of illegal drugs controlled under the UN 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances. I'm not sure if this makes it automatically illegal in every country that has signed that treaty or does it mean that individual countries have to ban it themselves and the list is merely a suggestion.


Anyway what's more interesting to me is that nobody has tried making either 3-meo-2'oxo-pcpr (aka mxe with the ethyl chain extended to propyl) or 3-ho-2'oxo-pce (the methoxy changed to a hydroxy). 3-meo-pcpr is supposed to be very similar to 3-meo-pce only slightly weaker so presumably 3-meo-2'oxo-pcpr should be similar. Same goes for the other one.


I know mxm (aka 3-meo-2'oxo-pcm) was made and quite well received (not sure why it never took off) but it's effects weren't that close to mxe. However the difference between 3-meo-pcm and 3-meo-pce is bigger than the difference between 3-meo-pce and 3-meo-pcpr.

I've wondered both those things myself. This thread says it all. Seventeen B&Ds? They would fill up so quickly too. MXE was a clear winner. Everyone I ever gave some too loved it. Even people who were dissociative naive. Sometimes there would be confusion as dissociatives feel very unique from most things. One time during the first MXE voyage of one of my friends, he suddenly looked at me, and asked me "Why do people like this?!?" to which I replied "Because it's awesome and feels great?!?". He was just like "That's true...!".

MXM was one of my favorites. A lot of people called it "Marshmallow MXE" and never has there been a more apt descriptor of the chem. A Chinese vendor screwed up an MXE order of mine and sent 20g MXM instead, ended up keeping it and falling in love with it. I never holed from it, but it felt like the most opiate-ish qualities of MXE were amped way the fuck up. I would just sit on my couch surfing the web, listening to music and enjoying total blissful euphoria tinged with the slightest halo of mania. I'm not sure why it never became popular.. probably because MXE was still a better chem for most dissociative lovers chasing a good hole. MXM was the ultimate chill out dissociative, and on lighter doses it was perfect for socializing, totally relaxed and in a positive mood but could access vocabulary and thoughts with great ease. Would love to come across this one again.

Yes, despite my initial reservations on first trials i have come to love MXE. I rarely take it alone however. I have a reasonable stash as it is obviously rare these days so i prefer to take it with other psychedelics. Either preloading or after a peak it really enhances other substances. For a purely recreational trip, it is great to take beforehand and for a more in depth trip it is a nice reward. 


I'm not sure why it has almost completely vanished, but it seems a real loss to the community!

The bans in china were pretty devastating to the supply chain and the demand apparently hasn't recovered properly and only would go underground as it is also banned in the EU.

Agreed, MXE is one of the best psychedelic enhancers of anything, maybe the best.  My preferred way to do it is to take a moderate dose of MXE (25mg, say) orally, an wait until I really feel it, then take the psychedelic.  It makes the psychedelic stronger and more immersive, while making the transition from sobriety to psychedelic smoother.  Once they combine it mostly just feels like a much fuller/more potent trip on the psychedelic, the MXE doesn't color it too much.

You say that because probably you didn't tried mixing psychedelics with 2-OxO-PCE ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) It potentiates tryptamines and lysergamides to psychedelic levels I didn't knew existed.

Methoxetamine had everything it takes to make it as a black market drug. It can be taken oral, nasal, rectal, injected, 20-100 doses a gram, storage stable, there are almost no people who like getting high who don't like a modest dose of it, the ultimate party drug in low doses, a hardcore entheogenic dissociative at high doses, forgiving of even ridiculous overdoses, very popular in its day, liked better than the illicit "original" Ketamine by many, less toxic than Ketamine on abuse. Longer acting than K but way shorter than most dissociatives, people feel so good that even addicts of other drugs ease their regimen while high on it, mentally but not physically addictive, readily bingeable, no hangover on sensible use.


It should reappear. Methoxetamine is the perfect storm of desirable drug effects, just like Ecstasy was. It has everything to make it BIG as an illicit drug.

we are all waiting for someone somewhere to produce this drug on a massive scale, begging for someone to read this and do so...I fear that these are just pipe dreams though.  who would do it? Its not like someone with a meth or mdma super lab could just whip up some mxe....they would need to re-configure everything or buy new equipment just to make the mxe.  and the demand is nothing compared to mdma and meth.


ketamine keeps getting made in massive amount because its a legitimate medical drug also so the peeps in india or wherever can just make a ton and move it out the back door whenever they want....mxe is more superior to ketamine though in my opinion, far more superior but has not legit reason to be made


I hoping some lab in china reads this and just decides to make mxe anyways because ppl want it so bad.  They could charge cocaine prices for it.


from what i read, they have good labs in china making meth even though its illegal.  why not make mxe and see how it sells

meth is very popular in China/Asia the next most popular drug is ketamine for the Chinese. So I think they are really just moving on and making ketamine instead it's illegal still but probably sells easier and at a better profit margin. 

Vice did a doc on a ketamine village check it out.

Methoxetamine is about 2.5X as potent as Ketamine and both cost about the same to produce per gram with the same effort - its superior.  I had the unsavory honor of watching a liveleak video of a Chinese girl snorting literally a meter long line of K and subsequently dying. Yes, K is big in China and kids do stoopid stuff everywhere.


Me I have plenty of Methoxetamine experience and experience with pure Esketamine. For me it was no contest, I enjoy MXE far more than I do K and I rather had 0.5gr MXE for that 2 day binge than the 1.5gr of s-K I had.

The K was a letdown to me, far more subtle than MXE, you need so much of it and if you dont inject you have to snort it, which sucks.

I was not impressed.

Yeah, I've had some experience with IM/IV ket and even oral MXE feels much more intense and all around satisfying to me. I also like it better. 

But I don't think it is ever coming back. 

I agree with you when you say it is the perfect "street drug" in many ways, but I think it only ever became relevant as an internet drug, which kind of adds to the mystique behind it. In my area (Big city in southern South America) there are MANY ket-heads, but almost no one in the scene has heard of MXE. The few people I've shared it with preferred it over ketamine, btw. But I think it's just not as "well known" for it to be caught on by the illicit manufacturers.  I don't think it's happening anytime soon, unless sometime someone manages to pull a custom synth somewhere.

I consume almost no processed foods or meat anymore and I get lots of fruits, vegetables.

I really don't remember it like that. When I was on MXE usually I was too dissociated and far from this world to give a fuck about synchronicities.

I've experienced the most synchronicites and weird shit on MXE for sure.  Feelings of absolutely everything being part of a vast web of cause and effect, "knowing" something is about to happen and then it happens.  I have had a lot of undeniable strange accidents happen with movement on MXE, for example turning around and my hand happening to be right where a lighter someone threw to me was and catching before realizing it had been thrown to me, my friend throwing a cigarette across the room to me and me catching it perfectly in my mouth, and we both could feel it was going to happen before it did.  I always feel very graceful on MXE, a paradoxical discombobulation and perfect physical control (until a large enough amount).  Spontaneous knowledge a few times.  3-MeO-PCP produces a flow state but it's not as magical-feeling or otherworldly, it's more of a useful, functional thing that involves more of a flowing of my thoughts, feelings and intentions.

I too felt graceful on MXE, even at high doses but especially low doses. I was the best version of myself. Fluid vocabulary, could juggle multiple thoughts/streams at once, was very much aware yet relaxed and completely 'in the zone'. 


I'm certain one day MXE will return to the market. No way this chem is fated to die out this early.

Needless to say, the vast majority of the community misses it like a lover lost before their time; and yeah, the 3meos have taken a large chunk of the community into the next stage of this ride. Some are onto O-PCE, DCK etc, but the 3meos have taught me how to navigate magic in the physical world, world-bridging the spirit world. MXE did that to an extent, but the majority of that 'training' took place in the confines of the mind's imaginarium. 3meo is the 'Type A' personality, whereas MXE is the 'Type B' personality. Extrovert to Introvert etc etc.

I also feel much less 'blowback' from a week of 3-MeO-PCP use compared to a week of MXE use. I felt sluggish, disinterested, kinda depressed for 1-3 days after an MXE binge, and to the contrary feel fucking fabulous for a week after a 3meo binge. Theories on why? The much higher potency, requiring less material for the body to process, is likely one component. I have a feeling the Sigma1 receptor has something to do with it.

Agreed.  MXE is one of the most interesting and special drugs there is.  Certainly my favorite disso I've tried yet, by far.

LOL I tried it I didn't like it and that gram is still sitting in my safe ![:-)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) HAHAHA

I found it to be pretty weak and very robotic. 3 meo was stronger at smaller doses, but I never went into high doses into either chem. The loss of memory and body control is not somthing I like. Plus Everything sounds so slow and distorted. I never any cevs or visuals from either, and it didn't do jack shit for creativity. Just felt like being drunk (btw I HATE alcohol also ?) not that fun. What did I do wrong?

Well yeah MXE is not nearly as potent as 3-MeO, no one ever claimed it was.  But I'd say either MXE doesn't agree with you, or you have bad MXE (the batch quality varied greatly by almost all accounts).  Also I disliked it the first handful of times I tried it, same as 3-MeO-PCP, I found them both boring and unpleasant until I "got it" one particular time (I mean that there was a trial for each one where the ideal effects suddenly emerged, not sure why it has worked like that for me with dissos but I have seen others report the same).


I have also heard some people with plenty of experience say they don't like MXE.  Everyone is different, just because it's a holy grail for many doesn't mean it will be for everyone.


Also, unlike 3-MeO, high doses of MXE, when taken with music and not trying to be up and moving, is fantastic, holing material that to me is better than ketamine for it.

I did want to replace LSD with 3-MeO-PCP, but kept it if only for LSD's historical significance through the last 60 years. I also have to pay tribute to the fact LSD was the first time I 'turned on', and for the many subsequent journeys. These days though 3meo has dethroned it.

Personally I can not compare LSD to 3meo...they act completely different to me separately. Together the synergy is otherworldly. Never have I ever been able to stare at something like moss on a tree and see the exact same "visual" as the person sitting next to me on the same combo while discussing it in great detail for two hours straight without it becoming something else. And if it's truly possible for two people to have the same "hallucination", then is it really a hallucination? Or are we seeing reality for what it truly is unfiltered through a brand new lense? 3meo gives you the ability to navigate these psychedelic realms comfortably without your ego being shattered to bits. You can play with the fractals, see what you want to see. It's almost cheating. A trip hack if you will. God mode.


I took a picture of this particular branch covered in green moss that held me captivated for so long to help retain some perspective in case I ever feel it fleeting. 


Long live MXE

3-meo-pcp doesn't dethroned LSD for me at all. In fact LSD still is the psychedelic I do monthly (Either that or 4-ho-met) and usually combined with either 3-meo-pcp or 2-oxo-pce. But good old LSD is the fucking king of psychedelics by far ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


LSD + low dose 3-MeO-PCP is fucking awesome, both manias combine so well and the 3-meo-pcp potentiates the visuals nicely. Also both compounds are stimulating but in a relaxing way for me and in combination that stimulation doesn't get overwhelming.


I would like to quote Ziiirp here on the big&dandy of 2-oxo-PCE talking about MXE, true wisdom words:


> 3-Meo-PCE is better for recreation. 2-Oxo-PCE is better for holing. MXE is a mixture ... for people, that don't know, what they want.
> 
> Click to expand...


I don't miss MXE anymore with the 2-OxO's and the 3-MeO's on my stash. They are more... "specialized", while MXE was versatile but lacking on all the aspects that make 3-MeO's and 2-OxO's so special. So nowadays I would prefer to have diversity over seeing MXE coming back again.


If I want to hole I take a huge dose of 2-OxO-PCM or 25-30mg of 2-OxO-PCE. If I want to party or engage on something creative I would take 3-MeO-PCP or 3-MeO-PCE. MXE had a bit of both worlds but I remember it was hard to truly hole on it, and 3-MeO's are far superior potentiating creative thinking.

3meo's are top tier dissos with limitless potential, but for me personally still don't hold a candle to good ole' methoexetamine. No other chemical has tuned me quite like that one. Made me feel like a kid again. It reminded me of who I truly was/used to be/am. Pure nostalgia. Relived forgotten memories I didn't know I still had. Microdosing MXE daily gave me the motivation to be a better person, and get back into hobbies old and new which I had previously lost interest in. It made life feel magical again, like anything and everything I could imagine was still and always had been possible. It was a true sacrament. A gift. Life hasn't been the same without it.

hahaha I suppose I see the 2-oxos and 3-meos having a high value and talk shit about ketamine or mxe just because I was highly addicted to the later ones, and doing them daily for years made that 90% of the experiences were lackluster. I have memories of loving those ones on my firsts contacts with them though.


Nowadays I spare my disso usage so everytime is special, that for sure contributes to me appreciating more the current generation of dissos that the ones I made in the past. 


I'm sure that if MXE came back I would fell in love with it again though, but I see that as a negative side. The stuff was really morish and addictive for me, as is 2-OxO-PCM or ketamine. In fact 2-OxO-PCM is my new MXE replacement for soft disso chill experiences, and it's an overall shittier, more lackluster compound.

The Spirit world breaking through is my best explanation. About a month ago, it was near the full moon as is now, something happened and I literally started seeing the spirit world, clear as day. Plants growing out of the ground and waving in the aether, huge,images,of native warriors inscribed on mountains as we drove by, heiroglyphs on all kinds of things, even glyphs floating in the air in front of me, a statue of a Buddha that ACTUALLY had a spirit inhabiting it, and oh boy, when we were singing in a harmonic sweatlodge, there were only four of us but I swore there was a fifth person the entire time (possibly singing with us?) All the while seeing more glyphs and sigils materialize in front of me as we sang, more clearly than any hallucination I had seen to date. After an initial life-changing 4 or 6 hours of this the reception tuned out, but not before returning a couple times over the next couple days. As much as I want to explore this further (intuition says full moon periods are a ripe time) I am taking off this month. I have not a sliver of doubt that what I saw was as real as you and me.

Thank God FXE (3-F-2-Oxo-PCE) is coming out soon, I was really starrting to miss MXE so bad. I don't even care about the other dissos haven't really done one in like 2 months. I got some DCK like 6 weeks ago and ended up doing it once and flushing it. I don't want to harm my body doing something that's not even enjoyable. I just want MXE back, it made life feel so perfect...


but I haven't been this excited about a new disso since forever... please fexxy, please be a worthy mexxy replacement. and yes i just made up that nickname for it. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

As a serious question to those who have used a lot of different dissociatives and/or understand their structure-activity relationships, is there honestly any reason to suspect that 3-Fl-2'-Oxo-PCE will be overly similar to methoxetamine? I thought the fluorine was an odd choice, not exactly structurally alike a methoxy.... Going purely on general chemical knowledge, I would have guessed that this one will turn out more like 2'-Oxo-PCE overall. Which, to be fair, is pretty similar to methoxetamine in my experience, but not so much that I think of it as a replacement exactly....

3-oh-2-oxo-pce should be really similar,maybe shorter acting, but I think I remember someone saying it was next to impossible to synth.


would be possible 3-aco-2-oxo-pce?


Anyway, if this 3-f turn to be interesting I will be testing it for sure

does "fxe" (honestly fuck the whole *xe nicknaming convention) have the 2'-oxo? some ppl say it does, but one cited iupac name mentioned no '-one' or any other indication of an oxygen atom. i just assumed it was 3-f-PCE... not really that close to a methoxetamine analog, if so, but interesting nonetheless...

i personally am not holding my breath. 


from perusing around internetz, seems either people are getting EXTREMELY expensive pre-ban (as is available from time to time) or are getting screwed over by unscrupulous greedboys. it is not a buyer's market.

Yeah right. It was the only dissociative that I was interested in and I never had a chance to try it.

I think its like that probably because its a scheduled drug in a lot of countries, primarily in China, the leading supplier of RCs.

There?s plenty of ilegal substances floating all around. 


And MXE is not banned in all countries. It only takes to one individue to custom synth it and make himself filthy rich (and Im not suggesting nothing...![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png).


Don?t lost the hope. Im sure some toxic avenger will step front and synth it for us. Soon

You kidding me?  If there was no demand, people wouldn't pay shit tons of money for pre-ban MXE whenever it becomes available.  If someone synthed and started selling MXE again, they'd sell it all, guaranteed.  People fucking love MXE because it's amazing.  I mean yeah, it never went mainstream, but you'd be surprised at the number of random people I encountered who had tried and loved MXE, who weren't into the RC world, back when it was readily and cheaply available.  Not to mention the hordes of people online who know about these things and pine away for the day when it becomes available again.

Yeah lol if that were the case there wouldn't be thousands of people on this very board constantly looking for chems to replace MXE since it disappeared. Hell it even has its own category on some DN sites. 


Maybe we're all being too patient though, we could always make some more noise - bring back the roflcopter!!

Only online people demand It... Interacting with drug focused message boards has probably given all of us a distorted view of how popular MXE was.

^ there's truth to that, but i think the global demand was considerable.  I mean, it was mainstream enough to get scheduled pretty quickly across the western world.  

And y'know, 3-meo-pcp still is still kickin' around, and that's an obvious *pcp analogue* with the scary connotations for some people with that one in public perception.

I'm kinda surprised it's still being actively made and sold.


We know that there's a shitload of interest amongst drug nerds - moreso probably than mephedrone, perhaps, because of the nature of mxe, being kind of unique in the sense that it's not just hedonism - there's plenty to say about it online, so perhaps that does distort it a bit.


I guess lots of meph users use mdma or coke or whatever in its place, whereas mxe enthusiasts are maybe more likely to post about it.

But i still think there's a demand there, especially as it has become so rare.

One person I was talking to about MXE's disappearance speculated that big pharma gained interest in the drug and is trying to develop it into a commercial drug to treat depression. No evidence to support that claim. It is kinda rare for a drug to come to market first as an RC and then as a pharma drug (I can't think of any examples) and the speculation is that pharma is systematically trying to shut down the manufacture of this RC so that they can make it themselves. Sounds a bit far fetched to me but who knows. I'm still really perplexed by it disappearance and would love to understand if there is a simpler reason, like one of the precursors is heavily controlled or there aren't enough skilled clandestine chemists to make this, etc, etc. One day someones going to tell the full story behind this I hope.

I always wonder because for a good while, MXE was cheap as hell.  I figure it couldn't be that difficult to synth.  It's quite mysterious to me.  Perhaps it's a precursor issue.  Strange though, as it's not even illegal in the USA.

Sounds quite unlikely. If anything, big pharma would be more interested in marketing Ketamine first, as it has a longer history of human use and study. I don't see any major pharmaceutical taking some semi-obscure RC with an already track history of abuse and addiction potential into the expensive and long clinical trials that precede a drug's appearance on the market.


I think the only reason it disappeared is because it's now illegal in China and the EU, that are apparently the only places where someone has put together a lab for large scale production of RCs. I figure anyone attempting to do that in the US would have the DEA reaching for their ass immediately. And maybe in other places like south america or africa or whatever; It would be harder to gather the material/human capital. Not to mention the difficulty in obtaining the precursors (At least here in South America - I work in a lab and getting reagents sometimes takes more than a month... we don't really have a big chemical industry here so most of the reactants are imported. I figure if one started to import big amounts of ACHAs precursors it would be a major red flag for drug enforcement... even if one would be manufacturing the "legal" ones such as MXe (Wow, big parenthesis!)).


There were some people, when MXE first starting getting scarce, that would say " Don't worry, if its illegal in China, India will surely pick up". But that never really happened. I have never heard of RCs comming from India actually. Given that there's no grey-market chem industry there yet, I guess it would take someone from China or even Europe, who is already or has been in the business, to move over there, get familiar with the local laws regarding that, and start getting a lab together before we can see Indian MXE or Indian RCs in general. But all that sounds unlikely, specially if you consider that the only places where MXE is still "legal" is *some* states in North America, I guess a few countries in South America, and probably most of Africa and some of Asia. So there's not really such a huge economical incentive for going through all the trouble. 


Maybe if sometime someone puts a lab together for manufacturing ACHAs in the US it would be possible to see MXE again. But I have little hope for the future of this chem.

Has MXE been patented?

I mean, ketamine's patent would be *long* expired.  Therefore i doubt here us much interest mass-marketing ketamine more than it already is (it is used extensively in medicine already).

It's illegal in China where they make it so unless they start making it in the EU where in the few spots where it's not illegal there it's not going to be remade. 

Why things like dck and lysergamines are disappearing is of more concern to me. I still have a bag of white tannish colored mxc from 2012 I think I might sniff a line or two today I never really got into it that much never liked it all that much. (Don't care for dissos) and maybe I'll dig into that bag of 5-APB that I thought sucked back in the day,( I think I just dose too low)

The legal framework definitely explains the drop in availability, but I still can't comprehend a complete disappearance. There's enough demand for clandestine labs to pick it up for sure. On the East coast of the US there are plenty of clandestine labs still producing PCP, it should be a relatively simple change to produce MXE instead. But maybe it's there that the community divide causes a problem - those producers probably aren't big into the RC scene in general


All I can really conclude is that if we want this to have any chance of reappearing we have to create as much of a buzz around it as possible to demonstrate the strength of the demand to potential suppliers

I was gifted about 150-200mg of MXE yesterday! :D


It's a batch from before it was banned in the UK, gave a friend some back in the day and he still has about a gram left.  It has turned yellow, he had it stored in a baggy in a pill bottle but the bag had a hole in it.  Anyone still holding on to some from back then?  I'm hoping it hasn't lost too much potency.

Lucky!  I have a bag that has clumpy MXE stuck to the sides, it's very nearly empty.  Over time it has turned yellow/almost orange, though it was clear/white when I got it.  Last time I scraped some out and tried it, it was still beautiful in effect.

That was that one single UK batch, the 'white crystal sand' batch. The only batch that I truly vouch for. I stocked up on it, and when MXE was going away I bought a ton (telling myself I'd make it last -- we all know how that goes! Gone before I knew it). Not sure why yours turned yellow, that doesn't sound right, but who knows. But yeah, that UK batch, the sparkly pure white sand/sugar looking batch, was the best batch ever synthed. I was like the Cigar Aficionado back in the day grading various batches and the UK one was worth hunting high and low to score. Anytime I come across someone who dumps on MXE, I just assume they got one of those weak/shady batches from China.


Fun fact: Much of the mxe we gc/ms tested was actually methoxmetamine, aka MXM, aka marshmallow mxe. Needed about 2.5x the dose, virtually impossible to hole, but still a solid experience to post up on the sofa for a few hours with music and walk the dissociative line. I'd even welcome the return of MXM, but MXE (particularly the hole) is something no other drug can ever compete with.

I finished my top quality crystal sand batch 2 weeks ago... :_(


Now I have like 100-200mgs left of a medium quility MXE powder left. I?ll only use it in minidoses in very special occasions.


Come on Mr synthesist, we are waiting for u!

Thanks for the information on MXM, I don't follow the threads much but I had several batches of that and as you said it was nearly impossible to hole on it.  I found out why it turned color, the baggy he stored it in had a hole in it so it got exposed to the air/humidity of our local area.  I wish I'd have stocked up on it back in the day but it was probably for the best that I didn't.  The last time I had a good amount of MXE I was taking it regularly and got very manic on it.  I recall one night I shared it with some friends and almost hopped on a train going Northbound to who knows where.  Another night after begin on it for a week I almost started walking to D.C. with delusions that people would start following me Forrest Gump style until I would eventually find myself at the White House to give a speech that would change the course of history.  I can't recall what I was going to talk about now but at the time it seemed like I _had_ to get there or the world would go to ruin.  An odd substance for sure.


I'm probably just going to save what I have for a nice quiet night at home with the cat.  I wish this stuff would make a come back.  I thought it would explode and become as common as LSD and MDMA.  I saw it do good things for a lot of people.  I know of several local friends that laid down opioids and cocaine due to trying it.  It does become a problem in itself though.  When you can't find any down sides to daily dosing things tend to get a little out of control.

That's the stuff I got, man was it divine. I still have a little left which I am saving for the summer and some hot nights. guaranteed a real spiritual bent to the trip. Always I still can't get over the disappearance - damn those Chinese authorities, if it wasn't bad enough them shooting all those poor drug users they have to go and interfere with my MXE. Bastards.

I remember the white crystal sand batch, it was the best.  However I'm positive that other batches I've had with different appearance were not MXM, as the dosage was the same and I could hole on it fine.  The second best batch I've had was hygroscopic crystals that seemed to absorb moisture from the air easily and clump together.  This is the batch that slowly turned tan over quite a long time, it still works fine though, I had one of my most perfect MXE experiences on it a while ago by scraping the tan, clumpy crystals off the bag... they all stuck together in a clump and almost seemed wet, or maybe really oily.  30mg had me reassessing my life (not a hole, nor an attempt at a hole)

I just came across a post from a few months ago on Reddit that I figured you guys would want to see. It's by someone with the username ex-mxedistributor, and it's the only post that account ever made.... Take it with a grain of salt of course, but nonetheless, it seems worth considering.

> 
>

> Hello! I used to be a distributor for a lab in China that primarily synthesized MXE and other analogs. This lab probably accounted for a good portion of the MXE trade during its peak, and we were able to undercut every other lab. I was only aware of 2 other labs that made MXE in very small, custom-order qualities, versus the dozens I can count on my hand for other RCs/analogs. I think we did well during our peak.
> 
> 
> 
> I can't give you any details on the lab's history and what it's doing now, but around when MXE started hitting the streets, another lab was having some internal financial issues (internal theft and partners drifting apart, or something). So the remaining partner did a bulk fire sale of everything they had: equipment, precursors, etc. Most of it was snatched up quickly by other labs, especially cyclopentyl bromide (also used to synthesis ketamine), but they had a large supply of 3-methoxybenzonitrile(not really useful for synethizing K, but useful for MXE).
> 
> 
> 
> This lab I was affiliated with buys out all the methoxybenzonitrile, and it wasn't too hard obtaining everything else needed through easy legal channels. Synthesizing MXE is actually fairly simple when you have methoxybenzonitrile. We had a few production runs where we ended up with TONS and TONS of MXE, we burned through all of the precursor we brought and ended up with about ~50 L of methoxetamine HCl across all of our production runs; that we turned into powder. Now that is a lot of MXE.
> 
> 
> 
> I had pretty stable deals to sell MXE for almost a year, but then it was made illegal in China, and a lot of the distributors I sold to would only buy legal analogs to stay in the clear. I ended up unloading all the remaining MXE I had to one distributor around early 2016, now that should be enough to last for AGES, so either he got arrested and had it seized, or shittons of MXE are still out there in some warehouse.
> 
> 
> 
> As for why the lab doesn't make MXE? **It was only profitable because we brought the precursor at rock bottom prices; other products make much more money. The demand, from the distributor side, dried up.**

Emphasis mine on the very last line. Again, I can't speak to the reality of this story, it could be nonsense... but if it's true, that last part is not a very good sign with respect to methoxetamine making it back to the market any time soon, and would kind of explain why it suddenly dropped off the face of the earth.


For what it's worth, a more active regular Reddit user also responded to the comment a couple months later with this:

Thanks Kaleida! That's some of the better info I've seen about MXE's disappearance. We'll never know for sure due to the clandestine nature of things but appreciate you posting, read it with interest. Hopefully someone sitting on some methoxybenzonitrile is reading this and wants to make a few bucks.

Sorry, I didn't mean to imply all other batches of MXE (other than the white crystal sand batch) were MXM. Contrary, most of the MXE we tested was in fact MXE, but a lot was also MXM. MXM was always tan to some degree, and quite fluffy. I don't recall ever seeing pure white MXM.

LOL! Classic MXE. I run a fairly large company (one of the largest in my industry) and one afternoon I started my usual dropping 80mg every 90 minutes routine, and by 4am I'd convinced myself I'd stumbled upon the best business idea ever. I mashed out tons of emails and fired them off to associates, distributors, my lawyer and a couple investors. I was walking circles in my condo crying and laughing because I was certain this was *the* genius billion dollar idea that I'd just cracked and was in such celebratory mode. As far as I was concerned, I was on the cusp of taking over the world. Yeah, we all know how that goes. Took a few weeks to smooth things over with the team after that and convince everyone I hadn't lost all my marbles. I really, really, really miss that beautiful drug.

I remember when that guy got busted in mid 2016. The police report said they found a shitton of MXE. It's kinda sad to think that maybe the last of MXE went all to waste.

It really hurts my heart that MXE has long been gone it seems. This has to be a conspiracy man. My last supplier had A LOT of MXE left and he assured all of his people he would have it for years to come...and then he mysteriously killed himself. I don't buy it for a second he wouldn't have done that. Coincidentally enough he was the last known source clear net.

After seeing this particular thread pop up and the kind of chatter going on in it...I for real have to say something.

I don't know if there is some MXE conspiracy - but it legitimately, to me, as a drug addict that has used the highest end of purity and variety of almost every compound that most people enjoy - MXE, in particular...Not only helps with the Emotional instability problems I've dealt with my entire life - It reminded me on a Spiritual level of who I truly am, and what Human Beings in general are. After the 1st time I tried MXE - it made me question what my interest in Heroin and every other drug I had EVER tried actually was.

It helped me get clean off of a 10 year opiate addiction. I taught myself about chemistry and brain chemistry and have a legitimate collegiate level grasp of multiple aspects of chemistry internal and external, that just clicked in my brain when I combined the drug with the reading. I literally was able to start making sense of what was going on in my own body for the first time in my life. And I got to know myself better and better and better - and I got to know what it truly meant to be human more and more and more. It changed and saved my life.

I'll write some more later - but on some real shit, Arylcyclohexylamines are equivalent to Marijuana in their healing potential. They can mimic ANY other compound and give effects similar in spiritual experience equivalent to even DMT, they kill pain equal or better than Opiates and in a more creative and effective way, they can stimulate better than Cocaine or Methamphetamine - and in such small doses that even if the compound is harsh, it's still a very very special hypothesis of mine that these compounds can basically do everything for the Human Body that Marijuana cannot. Arylcyclohexylamines are Spiritual - without the hippie bullshit, they're Religious - without needing a god - they're Holistic, while being SO manufactured. These compounds are the future of Humans learning how to heal ourselves thru Potentiation.

I could not have said it better me.meowfish. I think we talked a couple years ago about MXE several years ago via PM. MXE brought me back to the real me, someone that I had not seen in years. It helped me learn how to be completely content with my life and where I was at the time. It taught me what it meant to be human as you so eloquently put it ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) 


Losing MXE truly was like losing my very best friend. It absolutely was so, so much more than a drug to me. I miss it so much I could almost cry if I dwell on it too long. Nothing can or will ever compare.

^^^ Solutions come when we are unafraid to talk openly and start a dialogue on how WE can change things. With the Internet, the right Connections, Bringing Attention in the Right Way to the Topic. We can run from this. We have to face it head on.


And straight up - If MXE doesn't show up in the next 5 years, I'll be an Organic Chemistry graduate..........This Compound WILL NOT be lost to the History Books. It may be the most beautiful and perfect compound any human has ever synthesized for any purpose. It's Art - Mediation - I don't even like calling it a drug, it's more like a Vitamin or a Supplement. It WILL NOT be lost.


One serious concept that I've been having has been - as an MXE community of passionate believers from all walks of life and varying levels of education and so called "success" in normal society - The fact that so MANY completely different kinds of people have found something so Deep and Meaningful on Multiple Multiple levels of consciousness across the entire spectrum of Human Consciousness. 


These new compounds that have come after - to me mainly first 3-MeO-PCP, which I personally cannot use as it makes me far too delusional and manic even in the smallest doses, but there is something very beautiful in it to, and I understand (or at least feel like) because I've tried every single one of the new Arylcyclohexylamines - and was lucky or dumb enough to have long stints with both DXM and actual PCP. 


3-MeO-PCE is absolutely fucking AMAZING!! I think it is hands down the MOST recreational and chill - make you feel like a kid running through the woods without a care in the world - kind of compound, that even just one solid trip on it can completely regenerate your appreciation of your current Human Form, no matter how bizarre.


I got to do quite a few grams of what I purchased as legitimate Methoxmetamine that was also from a VERY reputable vendor who stayed with some of the best MXE that I'd ever touched since the UK ban happened. MXM in itself is a pretty beautiful compound - while I didn't appreciate it as much as I should of or could have when I was diving into it, I couldn't find good MXE during that period so it always game off as a bit of a lackluster experience...Not because it wasn't really interesting, but simply because once you've had some Real Deal Mother FUCKING Holyfield 3-MeO-2-Oxo-PCE, all other Arylcyclo's are just kind of lackluster. But MXM - I would willingly take a trip down memory lane if a Vendor felt so inclined as to start offering it again.


2-Oxo-PCE - I was not very impressed with the first time I tried it. I was a little scared to go too deep too fast, because MXE schooled me on MANY a silly decision and I was not interested in learning from mistakes again - I wanted the path of wisdom by learning from the past and adapting technique for a safer and better future. The first few times I tried it - I wouldn't take more than 5-10mgs in a 12 hour period, because I was scared of the possibility over Over Stimulated/Manic episodes on this compound that it may take a few to learn how to control or manage effectively. Plus I had read quite a few posts talking about how the nature of the compound was that the more you dose the more over stimulated you get. Maybe some batches work like that, or effect people differently - but I have 2 different batches that are ABSOLUTELY 2-Oxo-PCE, both are small rice sized clear crystals - all solid form, but pretty uniform in size. No dust, or goop in a bag like I've heard other people mention. When this compound is Synthesized right and with care - It's pretty fucking amazing. I've been using it as a Mood Stabilizer and for PTSD from doing a Year in Prison 2 years ago now. 


I've stayed clean off ALL opiates after a 10 year Heroin AND 5 years of 90 8mg Subutex/Buprenorphines EVERY MONTH - plus my Bupe Doctor was actually a very open minded and respectful Human, we mainly talked Chemistry in my appointments every month. He trusted my knowledge and proud association with Bluelight as well as Erowid over the years. Because of that - I also got 90 10mg Diazepam and 90 1mg Alprazolam - Every Month. He by recommendation of Reckitt-Benkiser (the company who owns Lysol who is the ORIGINAL SYNTHESIZER OF BUPERENORPHINE and they're the mother fuckers who kept trying to expand their fucking PATENTS instead of SAVING LIVES!!) - but in their Handbook they give Sub Doctors it specifically says they are NOT SUPPOSED to prescribe ANY Benzos with Suboxone, let alone straight Subutex - but that Doctor trusted and respected me to properly handle and protect these compounds and use them wisely. I gave them to friends who were suffering and lacked access. I showed love to those suffering around me - because for the first time a Human who owed me NO respect, who talks to Junkies and lying ass dope fiends every day all day, he looked in my eyes and my heart and saw that I was out to gain Knowledge to help any and all that I could with my Access. That changed my life. Fastforward 2.5 years later of Opiate/Opioid Sobriety (I've never even taken KRATOM, I legit have ZERO RESPECT for Opiates after finding Arylcyclohexylamines) 


Back to 2-Oxo-PCE in this story...These days - I could go get those scripts anytime I want, even this long after. 


I can't even GET A SCRIPT for ANY BENZO anymore, even after being LEGALLY prescribed them for more than a 10 year span - and they REFUSED to give them to at the time I expected I had a guaranteed prescription - I had just got out of fucking Prison. 2 DIFFERENT Psychiatrist - Looking at 10 years of paperwork refused to even prescribe me 30 10mg Diazepam a month claiming that my Behavior of asking for a specific dose of 2 different Benzodiazepines was contradictory. 2 DIFFERENT PSYCHIATRIST TRIED TO TELL ME THAT APRAZOLAM AND DIAZEPAM DO THE EXACT SAME THING AND NO PERSON NEEDS A SCRIPT FOR BOTH. It take 50+MGs of Diazepam to stop an Actual Panic Attack when I have one - most days, I don't even take them, benzo addiction is equal or worse to Heroin in my opinion, and I've been addicted to both. They are for emergencies, or for people who genuinely cannot live a "normal" life on a daily basis without them.


When I first started checking out 2-Oxo-PCE back in November/December 2017 - It took a minute for me to find a dose I enjoyed. It was always interesting, but just so all over the place - sometimes I be overly manic and spinny, other times end up nodding out on the couch for 45 minutes because I went into the second phase of the compound, which for me is Sedation - gradually leading to what I consider taking a disco nap. The deeper end of beyond the Sedation, what I'd imagine most call a "Hole" is not even accessible to me as of yet, or I haven't figured out what administration is required. I can do a mg scale weighed dose of 50mgs and not hole - and honestly I don't even find that dose fun. I use this compound how I used MXE - the most I take in one day is 30mgs, I do intranasal bumps of 5-10mgs once or twice a day IF needed, and I eat one 10mg oral dose in the middle of the afternoon. I'm more creative and energetic than Dextroamphetamine, OR Methamphetamine - and more focused and functional. I have fractured vertebrae in my spine that I should be on Opiates for the rest of my life for - With High Grade Trees and 2-Oxo-PCE, I have almost NO back pain, I live my life EVERYDAY. It's not MXE - but I'm crafting a program that works for me and taking advantage of the tools I have. I've been taking this daily dose off and on for 6 months now, and I'm not embarrassed to say that. I eat 2 good meals a day, drink plenty of Water and Juice, take supplements and vitamins to counteract issues that Arylcyclo's can be known to perpetuate. I can piss fine daily - no strange pains or odd shit. I have insurance and get a check up every 3 months and my health is excellent. I've found Arylcyclo's also help my Asthma - which I've carried a rescue inhaler DAILY since I was 7. I used it daily at least once until I found Arylcyclo's-the mild stimulation controls my symptons as well if not better than the steroid that is Albuterol Inhalers. After being an Opiate addict for so long - I've had "loose bowel" for almost 2 years, I barely took a solid shit that whole time. I started taking 2-Oxo-PCE in low doses like a medication daily, dissociatives have always given me mild constipation - this one is no exception for my personal body chemistry...I've been taking solid shits again since I started taking a designer drug from China...that no other medications AMERICAN DRs tried to prescribe me. I'm convinced this country has NO DESIRE to help ANYONE actually recover from ANYTHING anymore, there isn't a billion dollar market in actually curing shit or even helping people anymore it seems. Arylcyclo's have done more for me on a Social Level - learning to not be scared or intimidated to convey my ideas because I am just as valuable as everyone else because we are all Equal, until we MAKE ourselves either Lesser or Greater than the average at that moment. Addictions - I was first a Cannabis Addict (for real...) Then a Xanax addict.....then Morphine and Dilaudid....then Heroin...then Subutex.......Then I found MXE in my 3rd year of Bupe Treatment and was down to .5mgs of Bupe twice daily from the my previous 3 8mgs. I don't even take Benzo's anymore - I carry LEGAL Etizolam in my pocket at all times and that safety blanket of knowing I have help in my pocket is enough that I maybe take 5-10mgs per month, if that. 

MXE Changed my life and made me the Man I'm proud to be today. 2-Oxo-PCE isn't my #1 choice for entertainment and mediation, but it deserves a fucking gold star for the possibilities that I see in it. This compound - and this is just my speculation - but I REALLY think this one is a VERY MILD Mu Agonist. I DO NOT like that part of it, it makes me feel a bit more numb than I prefer physically and mentally if I do just a 10mgs too much, and I don't dig that. But that's just a Hypothesis, so read into it what you will. MXE made me feel like the best version of myself that I could possibly be at any given moment no matter how shitty life was being. Oxo-PCE isn't all that AND a bag of chips - but it's something REALLY REALLY special. I don't even want to post on this message board the incredible use I've found for - but I can explain a little...

I gave free 10mg bumps to a brother and sister, one over 30, the other over 40 - they both were talked to by 2-Oxo-PCE off an on throughout the entire span of a 10mg dose...they both had completely different trips, not even together for most of the time, but the message... They BOTH said the compound would casually question them as to why they thought methamphetamine was such an interesting and safe drug to use excessively for 10+ years. They both said at no point was it pushy, or telling them "QUIT DRUGS YOU JUNKIE!!" - they said it talked to them like a compassionate and caring family member or friend and just made intelligent points about how they weren't respecting their full potential as beautiful Human Beings, and while the true basis of our life is we have the option to say fuck you and be ignorant over and over again and make the wrong decisions, it's everyone's choice to sink or swim. The sister said the last thing she remembers from the trip was the phrase "You know what that Dragon (Meth) has been doing to you for years, I'm showing you there are other options in life - but I respect your individuality and think this conversation has been enough for now". These people don't do Dissociatives. They hadn't done Ketamine in years or even seen it. They both had the same experience about the same topic - while not even with each other, they did their own separate things that night. I was expecting it to help Opiate addicts - Not Speed Freaks, but I'm watching it help people of both sexes of both worlds REEVALUATING their drug life and addictions the DAY and sometimes WEEKS after they try 2-Oxo-PCE ONE TIME. 15mgs is the most I've allowed to be touched-and I will NEVER sell a compound that is economical as fuck and is as special as LSD was in the 70s to a new generation. EACH NEW ARYLCYCLO that get's developed, at least it seems so far, while different than the previous we all enjoyed - they are ALL something SPECIAL. I'm convinced each compound may be possible of rehabilitating a person from different varieties of Traumatic Experiences, PTSD, Depression - and possibly even Dissociative Identity Disorder / Schizophrenia.


I got off my MXE point I wanted to make. Does anybody remember the Church Of Neuroscience (Kind and Bright Organics)?? The gentleman who started the Church was a PHD named Jeremy Kerr, who took the time to go thru all of the Legal Means Required in the USA to make Designer Compounds that he felt to be Spiritually Significant to the Human Race as a whole - Including MXE (both European Sourced and Chinese) as well as Etizolam and either the 5-APB/6-APB's, or maybe it was the 5-MAPB or whatever the next analogue in that family became. I found out today that he died 2.5 years after founding the Church - due to health complications - but it looks like his idea basically went with him. The Church is no more. He found a way to LEGALLY set up a way to sell these important compounds to those in need - but charging a $10 fee to become a Parishioner/Member of the organization - after you were able to Legally purchase and research any of the compounds I just listed, with a monthly limit on how much you could purchase - based on your personal mental discipline and addictive natures. I didn't realize how AMAZING what this cat had created was until just a few months back when I was looking thru some of my old Notebooks and found my Parishioner Verification Letter.


I'm telling this story, because the Blueprint for what he did to set this up is available online - every legal aspect of how to do it. His web domain is STILL for sale as of today until July 8th,2018. The reason it failed - their paperwork to renew their registry was not sent in a timely enough manner so they revoked it. WE, as a community of MXE Respecters / Lovers / Psychonauts / Future Buddha's and Geniuses of a new Society to come...........If we banded TOGETHER and found a way to figure out a quiet and well organized technique to either Purchase or Obtain this already set up LEGALLY ready to go safe haven for the future of Arylcyclohexylamine Research of all types in the land of the not so free if you enjoy Mental Freedom and Liberty. I think we have enough people as passionate and down as I am to try and make a concept like this happen. Let's make a Church Of ArylCycloHexylAmines - A Church based around ACTUAL Freedom of Expression of All Forms, based on Intellectual and SPIRITUAL progression. AND...MOST OF ALL..............If we do it sooner than later, we can use RIGHTS WE STILL HAVE to create something that they LEGALLY won't be able to dismantle without looking like Monsters going against everything they conceptually believe we should be free to practice. 


Maybe I'm just overly optimistic, or Delusional - but these Compounds are something so beautiful, so special, therapeutic, medicinal, meditative, spiritual, enlightened. This statement is gonna get some hate.........................but LSD....to ME...............is kind of a boring joke of a trip these days after traveling the headspaces of these new ACHA's (short term for ArylCycloHexylAmine I use frequently). I have a decent head stash of FIRE L - and I've just been giving it away to cool heads. It literally was boring to me the last time I dosed. A HUGE part of me doesn't even want to POST these thoughts now - but I'm just one Human on a Messageboard that even my intelligent Drug Friends have never heard of. I feel like the people in our Community need to know what I've been seeing happen again and again first hand - combined with how MXE changed my life damn near instantaneously. We NEED to save them for US ALL - LEGALLY AND INTELLIGENTLY AND ORGANIZED - BEFORE they figure out what we know already. What do you think? I'm for real. I have the time and means to make this happen - I just don't want to do it alone and end up missing or a refugee in North Korea or some shit.


I'm convinced there's a reason MXE isn't making a comeback - and I REFUSE to let that happen to another fucking Diamond in the Rough that practically fell out of the fucking sky and saved MY LIFE. PM me - Preferably with a PubKey and PGP. Vortech - I know we haven't talked in a few, but I'm looking at cats like you that know my story a bit more than others and know what I'm about. We need to save these Tools before they Lock up The Shed for good...............until we have to kick the fucking door in and take our rights back.


MODS - Edit this post if you feel some ideas or statements are too radical and could be detrimental while intended to be helpful to all associated. I care about protecting this Knowledge more than just about anything else in my life right now. And that's the Truth. I can't watch innocent people die everyday anymore when TOGETHER - with some open dialogue and compassion - WE as fucking KetaHeads may have found a well to help an entire class of disrespected and abused Humans.

Sorry if i dont share your optimism, PCP have always and still be available in some places in the world, but it have never, not a single day and a single seller been available on a darkmarket.

And I can bet that any one who likes dissos would be curious enough to test it.

So MXE who is far less known and have the same legal statut, well ...

Dr Mamba - While I understand what you're saying, in my country MXE DOES NOT have the same legal status as PCP. MXE is banned in some states in the US, but not many - and the basis on which it's banned in some states isn't even correct. They try and say that it's an analogue of PCE, so it's covered under the Analogue Act - but

3-MeO-2-Oxo-PCE is not, to my knowledge a direct analogue of PCE - The actual structure that makes the base of the compound is the 2-Oxo, the skeleton of Ketamine - The PCE is just the guts of it, the interior. MXE is a Ketamine analogue, not an Eticylclidine analogue - and Ketamine is Schedule 3, which is not covered under the Analogue Act............So even the states that made MXE illegal, on a Chemistry level, didn't legally ban it. And I got caught with 5+ grams on 2 different occasions over a 5 year span, in a state that made MXE Schedule 1 under that pretense...but they not once ever actually charged me. I don't think it would hold up in court because the Chemistry doesn't back the concept of the law.

The fact that MXE never took off in the US like it did in the rest of the world - while Heroin, Fentanyl, Cocaine, and Meth run the country - While the UK had to ban MXE and it's analogues within a number of years, followed by the EU, and so on....................Kinda makes sense to me. Your average American is trained to numb their pain - not look for enlightenment to better their situation. Me country not 2 brite me thinks mosst dayys.

Arylcyclohexamines can be very escapist drugs. Ketamine isn't called psychedelic heroin and nitrous hippy crack for no reason. You could hole your life away as easily as you can nod, drink, or smoke it away. Methoxetamine was one of the  most positive forces in my life though personally. I have a feeling I'd have lost my mind long ago if it weren't for dissociatives and psychedelics starting me on a long healing journey! Methoxetamine was pretty popular in the US IMO. I met more than one person that didn't really know shit about "RCs" that knew about methoxetamine surprisingly! It just didn't make headlines here  like it did elsewhere. A lot of psychedelics and dissociatives didn't here somehow either. I feel like the heavy presence of ketamine in the UK predating methoxetamine was a nail already in the coffin over there... Coincidentally psychedelic and dissociative veterans will tell you, a lot of us end up getting into opiates. It's just sort of how it ends up going sometimes!

My trials with MXE were beautiful, but I found the urge to redose higher than with any dissociative except DCK.  I was breathing blue fire when I smoked cannabis with moderate doses, and the M-hole was incredibly euphoric and my body felt like a crystalline heaven.

I hate to break it to you Mr. Meowfish but Vortech passed away a few months ago of cancer.

I had the best sex of my life on MXE (and acid)...


I became convinced that I was in heaven because my mind couldn't figure out why I was in a state of such ridiculous pleasure and I ended up reasoning that I was stuck in some sort of timeless pleasure loop purgatory that is conceptually pretty similar to heaven

I did not know that Vortech had passed...I think he may have been the first person, while I never met him in person, that I would consider a friend and bright person on many beautiful levels, not only that - he is now the first Human Being that I've ever felt any form of connection to, that I am currently aware is Dead. I'm mid 30's and have never lost someone I cared about in any way. But Death doesn't scare me. I know what happens then - if you cared about people you'll and did others right, your mind will be at Peace. If you took advantage of other Humans, and didn't make right your ways - you'll get to see them one way or another. Other realms are Real. The spirit world can be contacted through these compounds. It's no fucking joke people. I've done it. I've been it. I've seen it. I have SO MANY STORIES I WANT TO TELL.


Does anyone care enough to listen? If you do, I legit have an entire suitcase filled with notebooks of full blown Arylcyclohexylamine ART - Poetry, Songs, Drawings - Philosophy...Every single bit of the Human Experience, when I was on my MXE bender - Which legitimately lasted between 3-5 years, daily.....I made some of the best Art of My Life. And I've tried to show it to my close friends who are ALSO artists, and they are not even interested in anything having to do with me. It makes no sense.


This is half a song I wrote in 2013. While doing massive MXE doses IV.


I've got a little Hippie Jam for you...So come Along, Maybe by the end of it you'll see what started as a Garden, it turned into a Farm. Now on that farm Birds like to talk to Piggies...Then those little Piggies like to chat with Bald Eagles - All believing their Chirps and Snorts and Sounds were So Proper, So Regal. They it's what's Achievable, But in this Modern World seems unbelievable...The beauty of Peace and Harmony, Humans treat this conceptually like larceny. Now I need to spit Truth for the Youth and grant access to DrEaMs..........I say most birds, yeah, they become crispy wings, and Pork just like Bacon tend to do Nasty Things, But to Me Bald Eagle's taste the best because they're Illegal for the Taking...have you started to get a grasp for just what I'm portraying?

These 3 Animals represent the Evils in Humanity. They represent Lust for Wealth, Greed, Desperation and Disloyalty. I Want to about these birds but first with startin' with them Stool Pigeons, or their proper appropriation a bunch of bitch ass fucking Snitches. Or should I say a Snitch, because at the end of the day, regardless of sex or race - Every Bird is a Bitch. They make a living acting like something that they're too scared to be, the birdies they Live that Wild Life...


It stopped there. Does anyone care? Would you like more? I've got this shit for days and days.

Or Maybe....


It's like 1984 now that we're in 2014 - Big Brother's Here for good, watching over your Computer Screen. They Used to have to work to acquire information, now they just sit back and observe our lost Facebook Nation - No Fear of retaliation because they know where you're at - People snitch on themselves - No more need for Dirty Rats - Better watch what you say, have your Own fucking back - because if you don't end up a statistic of this track....


Chorus:


They used to have to watch us from their Black SUVS.

Now They just kick back and watch Us via the net like a fucking TV.

Don't believe me, go ahead and Willingly Expose Yourself

When will mother fuckers realize Internets can be a danger to ya Health

Our Facebook Nations LOST, Whole Life story on the Net....

And they KNOW right where you'll be, all because of a Mouse Click.


People think they're safe, no respect for Technology - The Government is watching and they want YOU, FUCK an Apology - So go ahead and post pics with guns, puffin blunts, sniffin molly - Might as well title the post, Hey LOOK Uncle Sam COME AND GET ME! - A Real Mother Fucker doesn't need to post what He Be - Cuz at the End of the day...He Knows he's a fucking G - While all these fake thug mother fuckers always needing Validation - You keep Facebooks shit ALIVE always starting confrontation - All you're asking for is a Prison Term and some kindly Anal Penetration - It's just like Orwell said said...Goodbye Freedoms One by One - Big Brothers on Facebook DAILY...Don't believe Me - YOU'RE FUCKING DUMB - It's People like You that feed the monster that's become - The REALITY of our Daily Life.....


MOTHER FUCK THIS FACEBOOK NATION!


I wrote that song faced out on IV MXE and multiple other compounds in 2014, with a pad and pen. Dated and worn. Tell me that's not a fucking trip.

Just bumping this because I will never give up on MXE. One day I will learn how to synthesize it, if I have to.


Speaking of, I have collated everything I could find on the synthesis, but one thing I do not know yet is whether it might be easier to just take some Ketamine and go from there to turn that into MXE?

I'm sure there are, I wouldn't know anymore but I bet there are forums out there where people discuss synthesis.  But yeah I agree, MXE is totally unique and absolutely magical, one of the best drugs of all time.  It boggles my mind that no one is making it... I mean it's not even illegal in the USA!

I recently got some MXE and did it about 5 times over the past couple weeks. None of the experiences were that enjoyable, but that probably goes for most drugs when you just sit around the house doing nothing. In the past i used to take such high doses that it would always be interesting just laying in bed, but I cant bring myself to do doses like that anymore. Back then I could enjoy even lower doses though, and I'm not sure why i don't really enjoy it on its own anymore. Im sure tolerance and the novelty wearing off has something to do with it. Maybe Im just getting older too, because it feels like a waste of time.


Today though, my experience with it was just what i needed. Im getting out of a 3 yr relationship and moving away for school next month so I've been in a kind of weird limbo lately. Its scary losing your best friend and someone you trust so much, but at the same time it's an opportunity for something new. I wrote myself this long letter last night about how i have 6 weeks to get in shape before school starts, how every day counts and i cant waste another day doing mxe, etc. well today i woke up and did some anyway. decided to go for a hike and after about 30 min got to a nice spot and sat down, just hitting my dab cartridge and listening to music. then a song came on, the night we met by lord huron. i had the thought to change it because i thought it would be depressing and counterproductive to think about the theme. but you know how sometimes when you're really high and the musics on shuffle and it seems like the most serendipitous songs play, it was kind of like that. i let it play and then i started feeling different. idk how to describe it other than i felt like 5 years younger and like a huge weight was lifted off my shoulders and all the junk was cleared out of my mind. on the way down i felt like a totally different person.


i know that sounds like a simple antidepressant effect but it was one of those profound mxe breakthroughs despite how subtle it was i feel like its gonna be an important experience for me going forward. anyways mxe you still are something special.

Yep, I seriously doubt it's MXE unless you paid an arm and a leg for it, or it was leftover - and it sounds like you bought it.

I ended up taking some 2c-c last night for the first time, a few hours after my last mxe dose. after 1mg allergy test I waited a bit and then ate the rest of the 5mg on the scale. I was being a bit cautious so I ended up eating probably 25mg total in a few doses over a couple hours along with a few hits off my dab pen. I didn't get much in the way of visuals, but it was incredibly euphoric and music enhancing. almost empathogenic in the euphoria. took about an hour walk. then sat in bed with my cats for about 30min listening to music, which was kind of the peak.


I definitely get what people say about 2c-c being sedating. normally on psychedelics I don't like sitting around but on this I got the urge to go lay down. it had a very dreamlike quality. off the very slight initial impressions it might end up being my favorite 2c-x so far (also tried 2c-b and 2c-d). the body feeling is just super comfortable and it seemed to play really well with the mxe, at least at a low dose. wanted to explore it further to day but so far I have no urge to even do anymore mxe, but Ill see how that goes as the day progresses.

It's been a few since I've got to chill with any of my favorite ArylCyclo's - but in a beautiful way, I've finally found a Love and a couple Hobbies equivalent to Narcotics - Music and Song Writing / Poetry. I happened to write a random Poem tonight about my first meeting with Ms. Mexxy and since we're waxing a bit nostalgic, thought some of my fellow Disco Cats might enjoy it if that's your thing...I know I type / write out Poetry in a weird way - it tells me where the rhymes are so I pay attention. My apologies if that bugs you. This was pretty pure stream of consciousness, so I know it doesn't have perfect flow or rhymes throughout, but it made me smile writing it - so I thought maybe it would help someone else do the same. Cheers.


I got Lost Outside, of Time and Space, The Galaxies of the Mind, My refuge of Disguise, from our Race, So Human, what is this Life, Our Society, Where is my Place, long ago deemed Incongruous, My Variety, known to daydream inside our Consciousness, seclusion since young once Forced, became a dysfunctional Choice, consumed by Anxiety, Unfortunately got lost in the Vastness, on the last Trip, Attempting to Locate, all the puzzle pieces of My Humanity, to try and assemble Myself, into an acceptable Man, most my existence, didn't know the man in the Mirror, my only Understanding, unwanted by Family, deemed Useless, Inferior, "I" non existent, always called Myself "We", spent longer than Admitted, viewing my life from an external Dreamscape, unaware my Psyche, was in a fractured Condition, taught to please Others, to be good Natured, unfortunately I undervalued what I might Be, fell victim to Self Hatred, how can you love Yourself, when most days you wonder if you're a Human Being, I had no reason for Believing, for years "We" found peace in "Me" walking thru Life...


Waking Dreaming, dreaming while Awake, some miss the forest for the Trees, I missed the whole Galaxy, showed up late to Reality, and never realized my home is Outer Space,  an Alien in a Human Suit, posing in Clothing, I tried to relate to other Life Forms, but was greeted time and again with Hate, by so much of our Humanity, I seceded from our Race, felt Disgraced, Unwanted, so I made my own special Place, my only peace came from Inside my Mind, I became my own Confidant, my only Best Friend, my growth had been Stunted, until I discovered a Universe Within, there's so much pain in Our shared versions of Reality, so I lived Internally, where I could Play and Pretend, I don't know when I withdrew Mentally, for the first Time, but I know my Kind and for years was my only loyal Friend, free and Alone, for most of this Life, this story is not to incite Pity, quite Contrary, I hope I don't cause anyone Fear, if I'd never left this body and possibly this planet to Astrotravel, I don't know if I'd still be Here. But I am and I'm here to Stay.


I had a wife long Ago, I gave all I had in hopes of a true Companion, unfortunately when she moved on in the End, all I had left was an Opiate Addiction, if psychedelics open your Consciousness, the Poppy is white water rapids pulling your Soul under again and Again, with a hand on your Throat, trying to make sure you Drown, with a Sadistik fucking Grin, hoping you're weak and forfeit your Existence, I lived 10 Years, barely even Alive, so confused by what we mutually call Life, couldn't dig the vibes or the Hype, I was so dead Inside, no one left behind My Eyes, so lost in my own Body, it was no longer even Mine, but one Day, somehow, this I'll never Understand, into the Rapids,to my rescue came an Angelic Hand, not a woman or a Man, a being of Light, a universal Teacher, sent to be my human Guide, of Chemistry or Insanity, only you can Decide, but this story is my poetic Truth, seen thru and with my own Three Eyes, without this Rescuing, I doubt I would've Survived, I was a human Shell, with fractured pieces of my Soul and Mind, shattered and strewn all over my Universe Inside...


The first words I Heard, were "Please relax and just Listen", "Your worth and value goes so far beyond this Destructive Addiction", "I'm here to remind You of the man you've Always Been", "And to teach you, to help you, learn to pick up the pieces of the puzzle of your Personality", "And reassemble them as you Wish", "Your spirit is too kind to suffer any longer in this Prison", "The fight will be long, most won't ever Understand, but if you learn the True Nature of Yourself", "And the strength you have Within", "You friend will become an amazing Human Being", "And an empathetic helper and Defender", "Of suffering women and Men"... 


I had no Clue what to Think or Do, this was as real as any life experience I'd Had or lived Thru, all I knew was this felt so Right, and those Opiates were Bad Fucking News, so I followed my Guts, my Instincts, my Heart, because everything else I listened To, had self interests from the Start, my dick was out for self Pleasure, my brain only interested in drugs and docile dopey Distractions, maybe I'm forever a Fool, following my Instincts and an uplifting Voice, but from that day Forward, I started changing my life Daily, and began to discover the Power of My Own Voice, Thank You my sweet Mexxy, you saved a man from Drowning, in the rapids of opiates that ceaselessly keep on Pounding.


Thanks if you checked it out. I had a quick question for the Mods - I have a music track that is related to MXE that I was wondering if that's OK to post a link to in this thread. Next year January 1st, 2019 is 3 years that I've been clean off of Buperenorphine (Subutex) and almost 5 years since I used Heroin. 


I started writing daily for the first time in My Life after the first time I tried MXE. At first it was just philosophy and some trippy concepts, ideas, random thoughts on saving the universe type stuff - but within the first year of my use, I was starting to write a wide variety of Poetry styles, as well as songs - mainly Conscious Hip Hop, albeit my variety of the genre. Now 7 years, almost 8 since I first tried MXE, I taught myself how to Freestyle and Free Write, and am hoping to finish up Myself and my DJ's first LP in the next 5-6 months depending on a few variables. The reason I'm asking - one of the tracks I'm putting on the LP that's we're finishing up production on currently is called mS....Mexxy. It's psychedelic hip hop/with an almost D n B style and tempo mixed in. I'd like to post it once it's ready if that's cool with the Mods. No worries if not.


Have fun and stay safe during the Holiday's Disco Cats.

COngrats on being clean man, it isn't often an easy path but damn is it not a groovey one to traverse.


Hope you don't mind my edit but these words jumped at me- 


I got lost. Outside of Time and Space; the Galaxies of the Mind; My refuge of Disguise from our Race. So Human? What is this Life...,?our society? Where is my Place? Long ago deemed Incongruous.


I enjoyed your work thanks, strange read if you don't mind me saying but then I don't understand Poetry or Concious Hip Hop so hopefully you'll excuse an old hippy ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


Good luck with the career, mind you with the attitude you are carrying to it you'll not need the luck.

nuube - I can totally dig it man - I have a very offbeat style of rhyme. It's in such short blocks because it's kind of meant to be a modern trippy style of haiku - one of my favorite Emcees MF Grimm using the least words of any MC I can think of but says so much at the same time. He's an amazing artist who overcame a lot of hardships in life himself and has always inspired me to never give up on myself. I appreciate anyone that takes the time to enjoy another artists work, even if it may not match their vibes - and to me, being a part of underground hip hop for so long - It's all meant to be chopped up, re-cut, re-crafted and turned into something even more interesting or bizarre. Take care man. I got love for the OG Hippies.

I stumbled upon some MXE last night.  Probably the most pure batch of MXE I've taken and the first time I've encountered it since it disappeared years ago.


Last night I took a small dose and found that familiar wobble/headspace about 10-15 minutes after having snorted some from a spoon.  I usually don't take it that way but with the setting I was in it was the preferred method for sure.  Gifted some around and had a good time just hanging around with some friends new and old.  I put it away and upon feeling it wear off many hours later had some fun with some ketamine.  I actually explored the rest of the common dissos before I'd ever tried ket and this was my first proper experience with it.  I did really enjoy it but could tell the difference between the two especially when it came to duration.


Tonight I've taken more MXE with my second preferred route (oral) because I don't want to do my first preferred route (plugged).  I only plug it anymore when I'm seeking a hole which is something I'm saving for another time.  Anyway a few comments on MXE:  I'd forgotten how great music pairs with it, I'd forgotten how much I enjoy this headspace, and I'd really forgotten how moreish it can be.  I planned tonight's use to only be a small 25-30mg dose but found myself redosing casually with key bumps only 2 hours into the experience.  I did that re-dose about 30 minutes ago now and found a good level I think.  The initial dose might have been too low with last night's experience in retrospect.  Given the rarity of the material and the fact that I want to share it with so many people in the next few months I don't think I'll have much issue saving what I have.


I know live trip reports are frowned upon and I may do a proper one at some point.

I may have to suss out where MXE has reappeared... might be worth the high price tag.  Especially since I would hard ever use it, probably primarily in psychedelic combos.

I'm not sure if it's reappeared elsewhere. But I got it when it first popped up again a couple months ago, wasn't really worth it to me as it was cut with some insoluble substance so it was hard to gauge doses. But I estimate it was less than 50% purity.

I wish this substance would become available again. 

I've tried so many of the new dissos, and also combined them to try and achieve a MXE like experience, but alas nothing came close to my dear old MXE experiences (especially the M-hole).

Just in case anyone is blessed by the Universe and comes across some 90%+ MXE.... For those of Us who are already Tuned Tubular Time Travelers Transported Towards Twirling Temporal Textures Totally Therapeutic To Trippers  - I strongly STRONGLY considered grabbing some of the MXE that people checked out....But the lower purity batches that I've had in the past, not only did you have to do a considerable amount more to get noticeable effects in the part of the trip you're searching out - But I actually felt like the lower purity batches WERE NOT capable of even getting an experienced tolerance into the Most Interesting Head Spaces that exist. I felt like I would've just been disappointed with the entire scenario - Although I do give the proprietors props for sending it to Energy Control and letting people know that they were actually getting what they were wanting, it just wasn't quite up to par. I appreciated the verification.


I had one super random Domestic source that I was using back in 2015 I believe it was, it was smaller batch and you literally had to be on the site as SOON as they posted the ability to purchase, because quantities were always limited, but you get whatever they had, first come first serve. They claimed their usual batches were 95%+ always and they would actually let you if they fucked something up and it wasn't as good. I had switched over to Intranasal from IV after 3 years of Injecting MXE and I was actually learning to use it strictly in a Medicinal Way to help speed up getting away from Buperenorphine - but I did grab a decent stash of a couple of their lower batches when stuff didn't go well for them a few times in a row, and within a week of the 55-60% purity - I had gone and purchased a 100 Count box of Points and was shooting 100mgs 2-3 times a day because the effects were SO much more minimal and not anywhere near the typical experience that I was used to by that time into my use of it. That's another reason I left that batch alone - I've only done a handful of IV shots in the past 3 years, and I knew I'd probably end up switching ROA's as soon as I noticed the difference.


I'm still psyched to see that random cats all over the world are still interested in it all these Years later. Either for Nostalgia or because it's an "(M) Holy Grail" of an Arylcyclohexylamine so you can get some extra points on your final quiz as a human for getting to try it.


If ANYONE never got to, didn't take the time to, or it's been a while since they've checked this out....Here's a Current Link to Vortech's MXE Multidisciplinary Book.


[https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BznGre-0Bn01TGplanp0NmFGYWs/view](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BznGre-0Bn01TGplanp0NmFGYWs/view) - This is his Final Version of it posted. It's really really fucking Proper, ESPECIALLY when it comes to the Research Work that he put in to make sure the Book was accessible to all - but was fully viable for Use by the Legit Medical Community. Check out the Link and Read a GREAT Book about a Wonderful Compound made by a Bluelight Triple OG who returned to the Stardusty. 


ReSt iN PARADISE CLIFF!! Whatever that may be. Meeting You was an Integral part of my Recovery from Opiates. I fucking Miss You Man, even tho we spoke about what dying speculatively may be like on multiple Synchronistic 4am phone calls and I know that Peace found You and The Universe took You back QUICK. It's still such a Strange Feeling knowing that I won't get to talk to You about some of the Interesting Eyedeas that I have in store. Until then, I'm doing all I can to make SURE, Your Diligent Spirit an d Heart are NEVER Forgotten. This Cat was just so laid back, intelligent, Humble, kindhearted, and fucking TALENTED on so many Levels. I'll never forget the strength of the Positive Vibes that I got from You, even tho I was not lucky enough to take you up on some invites to Festivals and such and finances and my Hotel sized studio apartment stopped a couple Potentially Amazing life experiences - I will never forget the amount of Respect and Genuine Appreciation and Enjoyment that You expressed for the Stories I would write, BL Posts and such....but most of all - The Encouragement and Love that You showed for the Music and Poetry that I write. Any advice you took the time to give me - I always took to heart and I still use those tricks and concepts to this Day.


To Honor Vortech's Memory - I got a really nice, Dell  Printer that's pretty damn quick, a bunch of cartridges, and I'm making a very exclusive list of those that I think may either have someone close to them, who I absolutely believe may be able to turn their life back into something enjoyed Daily. I've been Printing Full Copies of the magazine, and I'm making sure that things are on point and in Order - and then I've been Thinking (Or Trying) to give the full copy Final Edition in Nicely Painted and structured Beautifully. I hope the average person gets an opportunity in their lifetime, to turn their Mind into a Comparable CPU, of their Choice.....But most of all are meant to be maintained, Trap is all I've got still and it's, a part they play is to get the fish that for some reason, is always at Peace. I want to keep the Memories of You alive by always sharing stories that make me smile about You with others even if they didn't know You at all - but equivalent to that, I'm Printing Up and Passing Out actual Physical Copies of Your Book to like Minds  that I believe will see the true potential of Humanity back.


Past generations of Men worked with their Hands, building, changing Oil, tuning up their motorized Vehicles. I'm hoping that this is the Part in our Human story, where We ALL finally realize and Accept, each other and Our Planet enough, So that everyday, in Our Every Action Be. There is NO way this levels could get to this. Be safe out there [with these Yuppies buying up my City 2 Blocks at a time.....) I Miss You my Psychonautical Brother. PEace. - Meooowfiiish.


[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpI_nND5ACs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpI_nND5ACs) -   This is My Favorite. I hope the rest of the BL Community is having a Quality New Year so far. I've been writing a song about Cliff as well that I want to make either the Last Track on my first LP, or back to back with what I'm hoping will end up being the single/commercially listenable (understandable) track. His Music was so ahead of it's time, I want people to realize what they've been missing out on - especially with the Lackluster music that so many call the best, or amazing nowadays. A track you can listen to Years apart, or 1000 different times because of the Dynamics and Creativity - That's beautiful, original, music. When you want to throw the album out after 2 weeks...that's why they call it a HOOK. Catchy tracks can be a Sneak Attack. Demand a Better Tuned Artistic President....

Try it sublingually - weigh out your dose, pick it up with a moistened fingertip and transfer to the underside of your tongue. Then just keep it there until absorbed. 50mg of good MXE taken this way always got me there.

MXE is not weaker orally, I find it stronger and a much better experience orally than nasally.  Whenever I snorted it, it hit me less hard (but faster), and was speedier.  Just eat it.  Or sublingual is fine, too.  oral was always my favorite ROA.

In my experience it is actually stronger orally. 

If you really want to make the most out of it you should look into boofing or IM, but oral works just fine for me. Snorting it always feels kinda wasteful, it takes away some of the magic, feels more speedy.

Yes, IM hits hard and fast, and was my preferred ROA for a while - but it's not really advisable due to the risk of infection.


Not heard the term 'boofing' before - is that IV? I think that would be a little too intense for me...

I happened to write a random Poem tonight about my first meeting with Ms. Mexxy and since we're waxing a bit nostalgic, thought some of my fellow Disco Cats might enjoy it if that's your thing...I know I type / write out Poetry in a weird way - it tells me where the rhymes are so I pay attention. My apologies if that bugs you. This was pretty pure stream of consciousness, so I know it doesn't have perfect flow or rhymes throughout, but it made me smile writing it - so I thought maybe it would help someone else do the same.

Now 7 years, almost 8 since I first tried MXE, I taught myself how to Freestyle and Free Write, and am hoping to finish up Myself and my DJ's first LP in the next 5-6 months depending on a few variables. The reason I'm asking - one of the tracks I'm putting on the LP that's we're finishing up production on currently is called mS....Mexxy. It's psychedelic hip hop/with an almost D n B style and tempo mixed in. I'd like to post it once it's ready if that's cool with the Mods. No worries if not.

I still remember feeling like I busted into sketchy negative  type meetings on MXE. They were not happy, even less happy when I cheerfully told them to fuck off. I remember Vortech agreeing he had the same tyoe experiences. Jeez, I wonder why it dissappeared?


I would plug it for sure if you dont use needles. Oral is good, intranasal is a waste to me if you are trying to hole.

I've heard of this legit dnm mxe sold at insane prices.


Quite frankly I'd rather buy 3-ho-pcp (one of my favourites), o-pce (my other favourite), 3-meo-pcp, 3-meo-pce, ... for a fraction of the price. MXE is good but imo not that good + the two new mxe analogs 3-meo-2'oxo-pcpr (I have a good feeling that this one will be very close to mxe since 3-meo-pce and 3-meo-pcpr are extremely similar as well) and 3-ho-2'oxo-pce (not sure about this one, 3-ho-pce is pretty meh (at least the batches I've tried, the new ones are supposedly better) should be here soon and cost less.

I'm trying super super hard to not be pricing or sourcing in ANY way on this one, I figure this statement being strictly numerical in value will be completely unique to each person who reads it, so it's by no means a definite anything... Just a stock market like estimation of how the Maxine may finally be getting re-recognized and appreciated again enough that We all may get to spend some more time with that sexxxy Ms. Mexxy. In my head it almost seems like it could be a really bizarre experience for Me personally, I think everyone knows how much I value MXE... but not once did I ever TRULY get to spend time with her without Buperenorphine in my system... It's going to be completely new and unique, I feel like a teenager waiting to chill with an Ex-GF a couple years later once they've both gotten older and grown. Plus 2-Oxo-PCE and myself had a pretty fucking incredible little 6-8 month affair, and I'm pretty sure that by the end - out side of enjoying/needing a brain regeneration and fun booster a few times a year, the 2-Oxo-PCE truly finished the work on my body, mind and soul that MXE started. 


I feel whole, since June 2018 now and not one day has it gone away or gone back to the multiple voices in my head, harassing and or talking down to me. It makes no fucking sense on any level, but it does make SO much sense at the same time in my crazy person land of my internal universe where most would get lost in the dark jungles of the mind to never return again.... but it's where I call home. And a good 50% - 75% of the time maybe like 90% at the absolute maximum, of you know, like my time and stuff and MXE and yeah I'm just rambling now. I've been so broke I have to be patient to see either of 'em again for some birthday good times, but Mexxy's been around the past 5 months almost solid. I just didn't want to be the only one who cared getting people all hopped up on vibes and goofballs. Enjoy your time with her friends, she's one sexy unique beautiful inspirational compound combined with a Fast 'N Bulbous miracle. Peace and Love DiscoSciples of MXE.

Good to see it back, although the batch I've tried (EU) is not as potent as it used to be. Something about the texture, smell and taste is a bit off... Have to admit I am slightly underwhelmed by it...

I'm hope I'm not breaking any rules but is the price as crazy as I've heard? I understand that that's how supply and demand works but before the ban 5g of high quality mxe could be obtained for half as much. No way would I buy it for that much (tbh I prefer o-pce (which is sadly becoming harder and harder to get... I hope they make O-pcpr soon which should be similar enough) and 3-ho-pce + their price per dose is much lower.... with no tolerance 1g of o-pce is enough to hole each day for a few week (not that that's a smart idea), while 1g mxe is 20 medium doses, less if you want strong effects, like to redose or have any tolerance (with enough tolerance you can use it up in one day)).


3-meo-2'oxo-pcpr should be here soon and will imo be quite similar to mxe and much more reasonably priced. I'll wait for that....

We don't allow price discussion, not specific prices anyway.  Gonna edit it out but yeah it's absurd.  I remember too, when it was like a tenth of that price.

Also- Is this a good substance for hiking or being outdoors or is it a more introspective trip?

My experience with dissociatives is limited to DXM when I was a teen. I will have a chance to explore 3-meo and 4-ho-pcp soon so looking forward to exploring this territory

I wouldn't say it's the best for hiking.  I'd say being outside on it is great, but I think a hike is too much required physical work... better to hang out somewhere beautiful, if you want to be inside.  For me, MXE shines in low to moderate doses with some good friends, where you can talk, maybe listen to music, etc, or in high doses, by yourself inside with music and eyes closed.

Fair enough, saying that the price of dnm mxe right now is absurd says enough. I mean it's good but it's not that good.


Hopefully the upcoming analogs will be priced normally and close enough in the effects.


Imo MXPr will be close enough but I'm not sure about 3-ho-2'oxo-pce (HXE?) due to the fact that 3-ho-pce isn't that good for most but 3-meo-pce and 3-meo-pcpr are quite close except that 3-meo-pcpr has slightly lower potency (based on the few reports from when it was available along with 3-meo-pcpy..... does anyone remember if 3-meo-pcm was available then too? Or was it just 3-meo-pcp, 3-meo-pcpy, 3-meo-pcpr and 4-meo-pcp)). By the same logic o-pcpr should be a good enough replacement for o-pce which is apparently banned in China (or will be soon).


Wonder what they'll do once these get banned too? The thio version of mxe? 3-eto? 4'oxo?

To those that have been using the batch that has been making the rounds lately:  Did you find it to be weaker than the pre-UK ban/post-UK ban stuff from back in the day?  The batch I had seemed plenty strong at first but as I got through it seemed to get weaker.  One night I weighed out a dose only to discover I got a lot more than I bargained for.  Within 15 minutes I was very whacked out and had to retire to bed for the duration.  I had taken about the same dose several times over the course of 2 months or so and didn't get no where near that level of dissociation from it.  The ROA was the same on every use.


At first I thought it was just tolerance coming into play but I wasn't using it as heavily as I did back in the day and the results seemed to vary so much between doses.  One dose would barely do anything then the next would put me out in space.  


I'm wondering if the latest batch might be cut with something inert and might have hot spots.  I haven't gotten anymore out of that batch to confirm or send in for testing.  By the time I came back around looking for some it was all gone.  As magical as MXE is if things are going to be like this I might opt for sticking with K for the time being.

Re reading "A Multidisciplinary MXE analysis". Miss you Vortech. I hope you are exactly there, in the interdimensional rubik cube, dancing, conjuring up and creating


> Lucid Holes

> The most interesting thing about my high dose experiments is that they seem to be increasing in lucidity, depth and coherence over time. It is as if I am the architect of my own technology that exists in my brain that allows me to travel interdimensionally, to conjure up entire conceptual spaces, visions, other sensory modulations at my will. This technology is activated every time I go ‘into the deep end’ with a decent tolerance (otherwise won’t remember it). One strange thing though is that these experiences don’t exactly feel like I am the driver or primary creator of the experience. Like, when I ‘tune in’ or ‘phase in’ to these alternate dimensions, and it does very much feel like tuning a radio and going from noise to finding a clear signal, I am often greeted by entities, and they tell me how good it is that I have returned so I can get back to my interdimensional signal surfing. It doesn’t feel like it is all in my head, if only because the signals are so much more complex and rich than anything I normally experience in my mind. It is probably my conscious playing with my unconscious, but it feels like I’m tapping into some experimental network that links my mind into a massive cloudcomputing platform with incredible computational power to generate landscapes of impossibly rich data streams.

Very sorry if this has already been covered by someone else but I read most of this thread and couldn't find the answer...

I'm interested in converting MXE hcl to freebase to experiment with vaping it at or close to its exact boiling point with a digital E Nial and dab rig....I'm curious to see if peoples lackluster experience vaping this stuff is from burning it or imperfect vaping techniques...

It has a boiling point of roughly 389 celcius 

My plan is to use said digital E Nail and thermal heat registering gun to verify the temp of the heated nail vs what the digital display says.

So my question is what would be best route to freebase this stuff?

I am very familiar with the DPT tek to convert the hcl to freebase but would that tek work with MXE,???

Any suggestions and or advice would be greatly appreciated...I have access to sodium hydroxide,  calcium hydroxide   baking soda, ammonia ((to use as a potential base) and methanol, ethanol (everclear), naphtha, toluene and probably some other solvents if needed.

Any advice would be GREATLY appreciated!!!

Sorry folks...just found a thread about this:


##### Smoking mxe - making dippers?

Although I was skeptical at first, after being told by a friend that it was possible to smoke ketamine, I decided to try vaporizing mxe. This is now my preferred ROA for low doses since it hits immediately and has a shorter duration. I was wondering about making dippers with mxe much like people...

Where are you seeing the link?


As for smoking MXE, I personally find it very wasteful, and it lacks the magic entirely, it's euphoric and physical, but it lacks all subtlety.  Plus the short duration is a negative for me.  On the occasion I do MXE, I want it to last as long as possible.  Smoking also seemed weaker to me than eating iit.  Snorting is weaker than eating for me, too.  In fact that's true of almost all of the ACHs, excepting ketamine.  Oral MXE is just where it's at for me, I have tried IM, rectal, oral, nasal, vaporizing.  Rectal is the strongest and best for holing but I generally am not a go-for-the-hole kinda guy.

I think anyone with MXE still just got a big stash and hasn't used it all yet.  To my knowledge no one has MXE, anywhere.  It's possible some marketplace has some old stock they're selling for insanely expensive.  If I found a street dealer selling it I'd be completely shocked.

From what I heard from an online friend very rarely small batches are offered on the dark web. I assume these to be peoples private stashes sold for very high sums.


I quit dissociatives and disposed of the last of my stash in alchemistic fashion, to end my dissociative addiction. Successfully, as it turns out.

**Any MXE offered for sale now is undoubtedly a sub standard analogue. **


No Sirree! If you put pre ban MXE in the freezer in vials its still as good now as in 2015 when the stuff cost €600 for 100 grams and €4500 for a kilo.


No doubt people with money to spend were living the dream and bought pounds and kilos, put them on ice and still have them on ice now that its €80/gr on the dark web.

I have mine stored at room temperature and it's still as good as back in 2015. I have like a gram or so left, been using it quite slowly.

That is up in the air. 


If I still used dissociatives, I would find €20 for a 250mg session of 5 doses of 50mg damn steep but acceptable. €20, plugged, will have you starting at noon, up all night, still blitzed the next noon and sound asleep that night.


RC vendors are charging €60 or so for grams of arylcyclohexylamines nowadays. €80 isnt that much off for what many consider The Best Of Them All, during a drought.|


A lab operation could make so much money making MXE and selling it fair priced on the dark web.


I agree its overpriced but, I'd pay it if I still was into MXE, which was my drug of choice for 8 years.

No I agree. MXE is one of my all time favourite drugs. But when it was £10/g for guaranteed good shit back in the day, €80 for a g off some dodgy DNM seems a little steep.

Oh my, Back in the day there was a vendor who offered MXE for €600 for 100 grams. I wrote them a cocky but polite mail where I boldly stated that €500 for 100gr seemed a better, more competitive price for me.


I fucking got the 100 grams for 500 and they were all used up till the last milligram :giggle:


Its stunning the retail price of that is now €8000. I'm not a dealer in any way, I was just a user who KNEW the ban of his lifetime favorite drug was coming, but holy markup batman! a €5 gram for €80 !!

My kidneys are fine, there was some irritation of the rectum from all the plugging and irritation of the bladder, like one would get with not too extreme Ketamine use.

I quit and both irritations went away.

Yeah 3-meo-pcp really brought some wild manic vibes.


I kind of miss it but it's for the best that one is avoided for the most part. (for me personally)

I was in exactly the same boat. In my naivety I thought it and all the other NPS's would be around for a long time. When the shutters came down I had gotten in another 5g of MXE and some 3-MEO-PCP. I stashed the MXE and started to experiment with the other and was sorely disappointed.

I just couldnt binge on 3-MeO-PCP.  Repeat dosing just didnt work, anxious as heck.


3-MeO-PCE binging worked, up to a total of 100mg of combined doses.


I find I agree most with N-ethyl ArCA's especially if they have a 2'-keto group.

Is this the final MXE Big and Dandy?

I figured it would have been bumped now as more research on MXE is likely being conducted this week and as we currently speak. I greatly look forward to the legalization of arylcylcohexylamine research and I expect the barriers that prevent MXE from being widely and cheaply available to dissolve in less than 10 years. I fully support the legalization of PCP and it's synthesis and analogues. #freeketamine #bringbackmxe

I figure somebody will reporting if their MXE is MXE any day now.
