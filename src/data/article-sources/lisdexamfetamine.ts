## Overview

### Description

This compound belongs to the class of organic compounds known as alpha amino acid amides. These are amide derivatives of alpha amino acids.

### Background

Lisdexamfetamine is a prodrug of
dextroamphetamine
, a central nervous system stimulant known as d-amphetamine,
3
covalently attached to the naturally occurring amino acid L-lysine.
1
Lisdexamfetamine is the first chemically formulated prodrug stimulant
3
and was first approved by the FDA in April 2008.
1
It was also approved by Health Canada in February 2009.
7
Lisdexamfetamine works to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and binge eating disorder
1
by blocking dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake and increasing their levels in the extraneuronal space.
6

### Indication

Lisdexamfetamine is indicated for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adults and pediatric patients six years and older. It is also indicated to treat moderate to severe binge eating disorder (BED) in adults.
6
,
7
It is approved for use in the US and Canada.

### Pharmacodynamics

Once administered, lisdexamfetamine is converted to its active metabolite, dextroamphetamine, which is taken up by the brain. Dextroamphetamine blocks the reuptake of norepinephrine and dopamine into the presynaptic neuron and increases the release of these monoamines into the extraneuronal space. The parent drug, lisdexamfetamine, does not bind to the sites responsible for the reuptake of norepinephrine and dopamine in vitro.
6

### Mechanism of Action

Trace amine-associated receptor 1
Agonist

### Absorption

After oral administration, lisdexamfetamine dimesylate is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract.
3
,
7
Following single-dose oral administration of lisdexamfetamine in pediatric patients with ADHD under fasted conditions, T
max
of lisdexamfetamine and dextroamphetamine was reached at approximately one hour and 3.5 hours post-dose, respectively. Weight/Dose normalized AUC and C
max
values were the same in pediatric patients as the adults. Food prolongs T
max
by approximately one hour and may decrease the exposure (C
max
and AUC) of dextroamphetamine.
6

### Metabolism

Lisdexamfetamine dimesylate is hydrolyzed by red blood cells to dextroamphetamine and l-lysine primarily in the blood. Substantial hydrolysis occurs even at low hematocrit levels.
3
,
4
,
6
Dextroamphetamine can further be metabolized to form other metabolites, such as hippuric acid.
5
Lisdexamfetamine is not metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes.

### Half-life

Plasma concentrations of unconverted lisdexamfetamine are low and transient, generally becoming non-quantifiable by 8 hours after administration. The plasma elimination half-life of lisdexamfetamine typically averaged less than one hour in volunteers ages six years and older. The plasma elimination half-life of dextroamphetamine was approximately 8.6 to 9.5 hours in pediatric patients six to 12 years and 10 to 11.3 hours in healthy adults.
6

### Toxicity

The LD
50
value for lisdexamfetamine dihydrochloride in rats was >1000 mg/kg.
7
Manifestations of amphetamine overdose include restlessness, tremor, hyperreflexia, rapid respiration, confusion, assaultiveness, hallucinations, panic states, hyperpyrexia and rhabdomyolysis. Fatigue and depression usually follow the central nervous system stimulation. Serotonin syndrome has been reported with amphetamine use, including lisdexamfetamine. Cardiovascular effects include arrhythmias, hypertension or hypotension and circulatory collapse. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Convulsions and coma usually precede fatal poisoning. Lisdexamfetamine and d-amphetamine are not dialyzable.

### Drug Interactions

This information should not be interpreted without the help of a healthcare provider. If you believe you are experiencing an interaction, contact a healthcare provider immediately. The absence of an interaction does not necessarily mean no interactions exist.

Abiraterone
The serum concentration of dextroamphetamine, an active metabolite of Lisdexamfetamine, can be increased when used in combination with Abiraterone.
Acebutolol
The serum concentration of dextroamphetamine, an active metabolite of Lisdexamfetamine, can be increased when used in combination with Acebutolol.
Aceclofenac
The risk or severity of hypertension can be increased when Lisdexamfetamine is combined with Aceclofenac.
Acemetacin
The risk or severity of hypertension can be increased when Lisdexamfetamine is combined with Acemetacin.
Acetazolamide
Acetazolamide may decrease the excretion rate of Lisdexamfetamine which could result in a higher serum level.

### Food Interactions

Avoid antacids. Urinary excretion of lisdexamfetamine is elevated when the urine is more acidic. Antacids like sodium bicarbonate alkalinize the urine; therefore, they may reduce lisdexamfetamine elimination.
Limit foods and supplements high in vitamin C. Urinary excretion of lisdexamfetamine is elevated when the urine is more acidic. Vitamin C acidifies the urine and, therefore, may increase lisdexamfetamine elimination.
Take with or without food. Food prolongs Tmax by approximately one hour, but does not significantly affect drug exposure.

### Mechanism of action

Lisdexamfetamine is a prodrug of dextroamphetamine, which is a noncatecholamine sympathomimetic amine with CNS stimulant activity. Dextroamphetamine is a known inhibitor of the dopamine transporter (DAT), noradrenaline transporter (NET) and vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2), with a weaker affinity for the serotonin transporter (SERT). It is also a weak monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor.
4
Dextroamphetamine ultimately blocks the reuptake of norepinephrine and dopamine into the presynaptic neuron and increases catecholamine availability in the extracellular space.
6
The exact mode of therapeutic action of lisdexamfetamine in ADHD and BED has not been fully elucidated; however, the clinical effects of lisdexamfetamine are believed to be linked to the pharmacological actions of dextroamphetamine.

### Route of elimination

Following oral administration of a 70 mg dose of radiolabeled lisdexamfetamine dimesylate in six healthy subjects, approximately 96% of the oral dose radioactivity was recovered in the urine, and only 0.3% recovered in the feces over 120 hours. Of the radioactivity recovered in the urine, 42% of the dose was related to amphetamine, 25% to hippuric acid, and 2% to intact lisdexamfetamine.

**Lisdexamfetamine** (also known as **lisdextroamphetamine** , **L-lysine-dextroamphetamine** , or **lisdexamfetamine dimesylate** when under the brand names **Elvanse** , **Tyvense** , and **Vyvanse** ) is a [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) substance of the [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) class. It is a "mutual [prodrug](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Prodrug) " ( [codrug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codrug) ) for [d-amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine#Enantiomers) (dextroamphetamine) that is approved for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and moderate to severe binge-eating disorder. Like amphetamine, lisdexamfetamine produces its effects by promoting the release of [neurotransmitters](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurotransmitters) [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) and [norepinephrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Norepinephrine) in the brain.

[Subjective effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effects) are essentially identical to that of dextroamphetamine except with a slower onset and a longer duration. These include [stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation) , [focus enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Focus_enhancement) , [motivation enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motivation_enhancement) , [euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Euphoria) , as well as paradoxical sedation in a small percentage of the population. However, unlike dextroamphetamine, lisdexamfetamine was specifically designed to prevent non-oral forms of administration (marketed as an anti-abuse design). This means that [insufflation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Insufflation) , [smoking](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Route_of_administration#Smoked) or [injection](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Route_of_administration#Injection) do not provide faster absorption or onset. It is sometimes sold and used illicitly as a "study drug" as well as a recreational substance.

Despite the marketed anti-abuse design, lisdexamfetamine is capable of producing dependence and addiction like other [euphoric](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Euphoric) stimulants, particularly when it is taken above the recommended dosage. As a result, it is highly advised to use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Harm_reduction_practices) if using this substance.

## History and culture

Lisdexamfetamine was developed by New River Pharmaceuticals as a longer-lasting and abuse-resistant version of [d-amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine#Enantiomers) (dextroamphetamine).

The FDA approved lisdexamfetamine for ADHD treatment in adults on the 23th of April 2008 , followed by an approval for use in treating binge eating disorder in adults in January 2015.

## Chemistry

Lisdexamphetamine is a [codrug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codrug) composed of the amino acid L -lysine, covalently bonded to dextroamphetamine. Amphetamine is comprised of a [phenethylamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamine) core featuring a phenyl ring bound to an amino (NH 2 ) group through an ethyl chain with an additional methyl substitution at R α . It can be referred to as a methyl homologue of [phenethylamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamine) as it has the same general formula, differing only in the addition of one methyl group.

## Pharmacology

Lisdexamfetamine was developed with the goal of providing a long duration of effect that remains consistent throughout the day as well as reduced potential for abuse. The attachment of the amino acid lysine slows down the relative amount of dextroamphetamine that is released into the bloodstream. Because no free dextroamphetamine is present in lisdexamfetamine capsules, dextroamphetamine does not become available through mechanical manipulation, such as crushing or simple extraction. There is, therefore, no way to speed up absorption via alternate [routes of administration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Routes_of_administration) , such as via [insufflation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Insufflation) , [vaporization](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vaporization) , or [injection](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Injection) , making the drug theoretically less abusable.

### Pharmacokinetics

As a [prodrug](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Prodrug) , lisdexamfetamine is inactive in the form administered. Once ingested, it is enzymatically cleaved into two parts: L-lysine, a naturally occurring essential amino acid, and d -amphetamine, a central nervous system stimulant. Thus lisdexamfetamine functions as an extended release version of dexamphetamine. Because d -amphetamine needs to be liberated from lysine via contact with red blood cells, effects are independent of route of administration. Conversion of lisdexamfetamine into active d -amphetamine is enzymatically [rate-limited](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Rate-Limiting_Step) , slowing down the time to achieve peak concentrations and decreasing its magnitude and dampening consequent striatal dopamine release, which is thought to be responsible for the euphoric and [compulsive redosing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Compulsive_redosing) effects of stimulants.

### Pharmacodymanics

Amphetamine is a [full agonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist) of the trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1), which is a key regulator of common and trace brain monoamines such as [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) , [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) and [noradrenaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Noradrenaline) . The agonism of this set of receptors results in the release of increased concentrations of [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) , [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) and [noradrenaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Noradrenaline) in the [synaptic cleft](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Synaptic_cleft) . This leads to [cognitive](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_acceleration) and [physical stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation) within the user.

d -amphetamine's affinity for the TAAR1 receptor is twice that of l -amphetamine. As a result, d -amphetamine produces three to four times as much central nervous system (CNS) stimulation as l -amphetamine. l -amphetamine, on the other hand, has stronger cardiovascular and peripheral effects.

### Conversion rate

29.7% of the weight of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (the usual prescribed form) is dexamphetamine: 30 mg lisdexamfetamine dimesylate is equivalent to 8.9 mg of dexamfetamine.

The subjective experience will differ due to the slower, more steady release of active substance in the [prodrug](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Prodrug) . An equivalent dose of dexamphetamine will have a higher peak plasma concentration and shorter duration.

## Subjective effects

While the subjective effects are essential identical to that of dextroamphetamine, and thus [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) , lisdexamfetamine is significantly longer in duration and more consistent in intensity due to its slow release. Although this drug is rate-limited in its metabolism, sufficiently high doses are comparable to its instant release counterparts once the peak has been reached.

Peripheral effects (such as increased heart rate and higher body temperature) are reported to be less prominent than formulations that partly contain l -amphetamine, such as Adderall or the [racemic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Racemic) amphetamine sulphate sold illicitly.

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)** - Lisdexamfetamine is reported to be very energetic and stimulating in a manner similar to [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) . It can encourage physical activities such as dancing, socializing, running, or cleaning. The particular style of stimulation which lisdexamfetamine produces can be described as forced. This means that, at higher dosages, it becomes difficult or impossible to keep still as jaw clenching, involuntary bodily shakes and vibrations become present, resulting in extreme shaking of the entire body, unsteadiness of the hands, and a general loss of fine motor control. This effect is replaced with mild fatigue and general exhaustion during the offset of the experience.
- **[Spontaneous bodily sensations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_bodily_sensations)** - The "body high" of lisdexamphetamine can be described as a moderate euphoric tingling sensation that encompasses the entire body. This sensation maintains a consistent presence that steadily rises with the onset and hits its limit once the peak has been reached.
- **[Abnormal heartbeat](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Abnormal_heartbeat)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Increased heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate)**
- **[Increased blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Appetite suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Appetite_suppression)** - This effect is more pronounced compared to [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) , sometimes causing people to not eat for the entire duration of action. Lisdexamfetamine is sometimes prescribed to treat binge eating disorder due to its strong appetite suppressing effect.
- **[Bronchodilation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bronchodilation)**
- **[Muscle tension](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_tension)**
- **[Dehydration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dehydration)**
- **[Dry mouth](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dry_mouth)**
- **[Frequent urination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Frequent_urination)**
- **[Increased bodily temperature](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_bodily_temperature)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Increased perspiration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_perspiration)**
- **[Nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea)** - This effect usually only occurs at heavy doses.
- **[Pupil dilation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pupil_dilation)** - This effect is more prominent on the offset of the experience and usually only occurs at common to heavy doses.
- **[Stamina enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stamina_enhancement)**
- **[Teeth grinding](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Teeth_grinding)** - This component can be considered to be less intense when compared with that of [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) .
- **[Temporary erectile dysfunction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Temporary_erectile_dysfunction)**
- **[Vasoconstriction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction)** ### Visual effects
 
- The visual effects of lisdexamfetamine are usually less consistent and only mildly noticeable at higher dosages. They are somewhat comparable to the visual effects of [deliriants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Deliriants) and occur more readily in darker areas. 
#### Enhancements
 
- **[Visual acuity enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_acuity_enhancement)**
- **[Double vision](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Double_vision)** - Amphetamines can cause double vision at high doses.
 
#### Distortions
 
- **[Drifting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_drifting)** *( [breathing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_drifting#Breathing) and [morphing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_drifting#Morphing) )* - This effect is usually subtle and only occurs at higher doses, after long periods of being awake, or when combined with [cannabis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cannabis) . Commonly this consists of level 1-2 drifting.
- **[Brightness alteration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Brightness_alteration)** - Lisdexamfetamine can make spaces seem brighter as a result of its pupil dilating effects.
 
#### Hallucinatory states
 
- **[Transformations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Transformations)** - This effect occurs very rarely, and typically only when the user has taken high doses, is coming down, or has been awake for unusually long periods. They are usually very mild when they do occur. ### Cognitive effects
 
- Lisdexamfetamine shares most of its cognitive effects with other amphetamines, although it is less forceful in its come up due to the slow release mechanism. It produces a variety of cognitive enhancements associated with [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) . However, during the latter part of the duration, these cognitive enhancements may compete with or be nullified by the accumulated dopamine depletion and its effects. The most prominent of these cognitive effects generally include: 
- **[Analysis enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Analysis_enhancement)**
- **[Anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety)** - This effect occurs more frequently on the offset phase of the experience.
- **[Creativity enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Creativity_enhancement)**
- **[Compulsive redosing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Compulsive_redosing)** - Due to the slow come up of lisdexamfetamine, the full effects may not be felt for up to 3 hours after consumption, causing some to redose during the come up. Compulsive redosing is more common if heavy doses are taken.
- **[Ego inflation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ego_inflation)**
- **[Emotion suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Emotion_suppression)** - This effect is more commonly reported with lisdexamfetamine, in comparison to other [amphetamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) such as [dextroamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dextroamphetamine) and [methamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) . It is usually most intense at low and common doses.
- **[Focus enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Focus_enhancement)**
- **[Irritability](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Irritability)** - This effect occurs more frequently on the offset phase of the experience.
- **[Immersion enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Immersion_enhancement)**
- **[Increased music appreciation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_music_appreciation)**
- **[Memory enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Memory_enhancement)**
- **[Motivation enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motivation_enhancement)**

- - **[Enhancements](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_enhancement)**
- **[Hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_hallucinations)** - Use of lisdexamfetamine and other amphetamines, at a strong or heavy dose, can occasionally cause mild auditory hallucinations. These hallucinations most commonly occur amongst a source of white noise, such as a fan, and typically consist of quiet phantom music or voices. Lisdexamfetamine may also cause auditory hallucinations in the form of stimulant psychosis. ### After effects
 
- The effects which occur during the [offset](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Offset) of a [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) experience generally feel negative and uncomfortable in comparison to the effects which occurred during its [peak](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Peak) . This is often referred to as a "comedown" and occurs because of [neurotransmitter](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurotransmitter) depletion. The comedown produced by lisdexamfetamine, depending on the user, is often reported to be much less intense, or much more intense than its metabolite, [dextroamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dextroamphetamine) , due to its extended release mechanism. Its effects commonly include: 
- **[Anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety)**
- **[Appetite suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Appetite_suppression)**
- **[Cognitive fatigue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_fatigue)**
- **[Depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depression)**
- **[Irritability](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Irritability)**
- **[Motivation suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motivation_suppression)**
- **[Thought deceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_deceleration)**
- **[Wakefulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness)**
 Making sure to eat well and to hydrate are recommended to decrease the severity of comedown effects. Using mild sedatives is also a common strategy for stimulant comedowns.

## Toxicity and Harm Potential

In rodents and primates, sufficiently high doses of amphetamine cause dopaminergic neurotoxicity, or damage to dopamine neurons, which is characterized by reduced transporter and receptor function. There is no evidence that amphetamine is directly neurotoxic in humans. However, large doses of amphetamine may cause indirect neurotoxicity as a result of increased oxidative stress from reactive oxygen species and autoxidation of dopamine.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this drug.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

Addiction is a serious risk with heavy recreational amphetamine use, but is unlikely to arise from typical long-term medical use at therapeutic doses. Lisdexamfetamine has been posited to have less potential for abuse and addiction than other pharmaceutical amphetamines due to the slower onset and the self-limiting metabolism, which puts a cap on the maximum peak plasma concentration and consequent dopamine release. Caution is nonetheless advised, as with other drugs in the amphetamine class.

Tolerance develops rapidly in amphetamine abuse (i.e. a recreational amphetamine overdose), so periods of extended use often require increasingly larger doses of the drug in order to achieve the same effect. Repeated use of lisdexamfetamine results in a gradual tolerance proportional to the dosage taken. Patients prescribed this drug often must increase their dosage after a time to maintain its efficacy.

### Psychosis

Using amphetamines in very high doses can result in [stimulant psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant_psychosis) which may include symptoms such as paranoia, delusions, and hallucinations, including the infamous [Shadow people](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Shadow_people) . A Cochrane Collaboration review on treatment for amphetamine, dextroamphetamine, and methamphetamine psychosis states that about 5–15% of users fail to recover completely. According to the same review, there is at least one trial that shows antipsychotic medications effectively resolve the symptoms of acute amphetamine psychosis. Psychosis very rarely arises from therapeutic use. The combination of prolonged use of high doses combined with sleep deprivation significantly increases the risk of stimulant psychosis

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **Alcohol** - Drinking alcohol on stimulants is considered risky because it reduces the sedative effects of the alcohol that the body uses to gauge drunkenness. This often leads to excessive drinking with greatly reduced inhibitions, increasing the risk of liver damage and increased dehydration. The effects of stimulants will also allow one to drink past a point where they might normally pass out, increasing the risk. If you do decide to do this then you should set a limit of how much you will drink each hour and stick to it, bearing in mind that you will feel the alcohol and the stimulant less.
- **GHB** / **GBL** - Stimulants increase respiration rate allowing a higher dose of sedatives. If the stimulant wears off first then the depressant effects of the GHB/GBL may overcome the user and cause respiratory arrest.
- **Opioids** - Stimulants increase respiration rate allowing a higher dose of opiates. If the stimulant wears off first then the opiate may overcome the patient and cause respiratory arrest.
- **Cocaine** - The rewarding effects of cocaine are mediated by DAT inhibition, and an increase of exocytosis of dopamine through the cell membrane. Amphetamine reverses the direction of DAT and the direction vesicular transports within the cell by a pH mediated mechanism of displacement, thus excludes the regular mechanism of dopamine release through means of exocytosis because the effects Na+/K+ ATPase are inhibited. You will find cardiac effects with the combination of cocaine and amphetamine due to a SERT mediated mechanism from the subsequent activation of 5-HT2B, which is an effect of serotonin-related valvulopathy. Amphetamines generally cause hypertension in models of abuse, and this combination can increase the chances of syncope due to turbulent blood flow during valve operation. The rewarding mechanisms of cocaine are reversed by administration of amphetamine.
- **Cannabis** - Stimulants increase [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) levels and the risk of [thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops) and [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) which can lead to negative experiences.
- **Caffeine** - This combination of stimulants is generally considered unnecessary and may increase strain on the heart, as well as potentially causing anxiety and physical discomfort.
- **Tramadol** - Tramadol and stimulants both increase the risk of seizures.
- **DXM** - Both substances raise heart rate, in extreme cases, panic attacks caused by these substances have led to more serious heart issues.
- **Ketamine** - Combining amphetamine and ketamine may result in psychoses that resemble schizophrenia, but not worse than the psychoses produced by either substance alone, but this is debatable. This is due to amphetamines ability to attenuated the disruption of working memory caused by ketamine. Amphetamine alone may result in grandiosity, paranoia, or somatic delusions with little to no effect on negative symptoms. Ketamine, however, will result in thought disorders, disruption of executive functioning, and delusions due to a modification of conception. These mechanisms are due to an increase of dopaminergic activity in the mesolimbic pathway caused by amphetamine due to its pharmacology effecting dopamine, and due to a disruption of dopaminergic functioning in the mesocortical pathways via NMDA antagonism effects of ketamine. Combining the two, you may expect mainly thought disorder along with positive symptoms.
- **PCP** - Increases risk of tachycardia, hypertension, and manic states.
- **Methoxetamine** - Increases risk of tachycardia, hypertension, and manic states.
- **Psychedelics** (e.g. ***[LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) , [mescaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mescaline) , [psilocybin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocybin)*** ) - Increases risk of [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , and [thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops) . 
- **25x-NBOMe** - Amphetamines and NBOMes both provide considerable stimulation that when combined they can result in tachycardia, hypertension, vasoconstriction and, in extreme cases, heart failure. The anxiogenic and focusing effects of stimulants are also not good in combination with psychedelics as they can lead to unpleasant thought loops. NBOMes are known to cause seizures and stimulants can increase this risk.
- **2C-T-x** - Suspected of mild MAOI properties. May increase the risk of hypertensive crisis.
- **5-MeO-xxT** - Suspected of mild MAOI properties. May increase the risk of hypertensive crisis.
- **DOx**
- **aMT** - aMT has MAOI properties which may interact unfavorably with amphetamines.
- **MAOIs** - MAO-B inhibitors can increase the potency and duration of phenethylamines unpredictably. MAO-A inhibitors with amphetamine can lead to hypertensive crises.

*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisdexamfetamine*

Lisdexamfetamine, sold under the brand names Vyvanse and Elvanse among others, is a stimulant medication that is used as a treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in both children and adults, and for moderate-to-severe binge eating disorder in adults. A prodrug of dextroamphetamine, lisdexamfetamine is taken by mouth. Its effects generally begin within 90 minutes and last for up to 14 hours.
Common side effects of lisdexamfetamine include loss of appetite, anxiety, diarrhea, trouble sleeping, irritability, and nausea. Rare but serious side effects include mania, sudden cardiac death in those with underlying heart problems, and psychosis. It has a high potential for substance abuse. Serotonin syndrome may occur if used with certain other medications. Its use during pregnancy may result in harm to the baby, and use during breastfeeding is not recommended by the manufacturer.
Lisdexamfetamine is an inactive prodrug that is formed by the condensation of L-lysine, a naturally occurring amino acid, and dextroamphetamine. In the body, metabolic action reverses this process to release the active agent, the central nervous system (CNS) stimulant dextroamphetamine.
Lisdexamfetamine was approved for medical use in the United States in 2007 and in the European Union in 2012. In 2023, it was the 76th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 9 million prescriptions. It is a Class B controlled substance in the United Kingdom, a Schedule 8 controlled drug in Australia, and a Schedule II controlled substance in the United States.

## Uses

### Medical

Lisdexamfetamine is used primarily as a treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and binge eating disorder. It has similar off-label uses as those of other pharmaceutical amphetamines, such as the treatment of narcolepsy. Individuals over the age of 65 were not commonly tested in clinical trials of lisdexamfetamine for ADHD. According to a 2019 systematic review, lisdexamfetamine was the most effective treatment for adult ADHD.

#### ADHD

Long-term amphetamine exposure at sufficiently high doses in some animal species is known to produce abnormal dopamine system development or nerve damage, but, in humans with ADHD, long-term use of pharmaceutical amphetamines at therapeutic doses appears to improve brain development and nerve growth. Reviews of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies suggest that long-term treatment with amphetamine decreases abnormalities in brain structure and function found in subjects with ADHD, and improves function in several parts of the brain, such as the right caudate nucleus of the basal ganglia.
Reviews of clinical stimulant research have established the safety and effectiveness of long-term continuous amphetamine use for the treatment of ADHD. Randomized controlled trials of continuous stimulant therapy for the treatment of ADHD spanning 2 years have demonstrated treatment effectiveness and safety. Two reviews have indicated that long-term continuous stimulant therapy for ADHD is effective for reducing the core symptoms of ADHD (i.e., hyperactivity, inattention, and impulsivity), enhancing quality of life and academic achievement, and producing improvements in a large number of functional outcomes across 9 categories of outcomes related to academics, antisocial behavior, driving, non-medicinal drug use, obesity, occupation, self-esteem, service use (i.e., academic, occupational, health, financial, and legal services), and social function. Additionally, a 2024 meta-analytic systematic review reported moderate improvements in quality of life when amphetamine treatment is used for ADHD. One review highlighted a nine-month randomized controlled trial of amphetamine treatment for ADHD in children that found an average increase of 4.5 IQ points, continued increases in attention, and continued decreases in disruptive behaviors and hyperactivity. Another review indicated that, based upon the longest follow-up studies conducted to date, lifetime stimulant therapy that begins during childhood is continuously effective for controlling ADHD symptoms and reduces the risk of developing a substance use disorder as an adult. 
Models of ADHD suggest that it is associated with functional impairments in some of the brain's neurotransmitter systems; these functional impairments involve impaired dopamine neurotransmission in the mesocorticolimbic projection and norepinephrine neurotransmission in the noradrenergic projections from the locus coeruleus to the prefrontal cortex. Stimulants like methylphenidate and amphetamine are effective in treating ADHD because they increase neurotransmitter activity in these systems. Approximately 80% of those who use these stimulants see improvements in ADHD symptoms. Children with ADHD who use stimulant medications generally have better relationships with peers and family members, perform better in school, are less distractible and impulsive, and have longer attention spans. The Cochrane reviews on the treatment of ADHD in children, adolescents, and adults with pharmaceutical amphetamines stated that short-term studies have demonstrated that these drugs decrease the severity of symptoms, but they have higher discontinuation rates than non-stimulant medications due to their adverse side effects. However, a 2025 meta-analytic systematic review of 113 randomized controlled trials found that stimulant medications were the only intervention with robust short-term efficacy, and were associated with lower all-cause treatment discontinuation rates than non-stimulant medications (e.g., atomoxetine). A Cochrane review on the treatment of ADHD in children with tic disorders such as Tourette syndrome indicated that stimulants in general do not make tics worse, but high doses of dextroamphetamine could exacerbate tics in some individuals.

#### Binge eating disorder

Binge eating disorder (BED) is characterized by recurrent and persistent episodes of compulsive binge eating. These episodes are often accompanied by marked distress and a feeling of loss of control over eating. The pathophysiology of BED is not fully understood, but it is believed to involve dysfunctional dopaminergic reward circuitry along the cortico-striatal-thalamic-cortical loop. As of July 2024, lisdexamfetamine is the only USFDA- and TGA-approved pharmacotherapy for BED. Evidence suggests that lisdexamfetamine's treatment efficacy in BED is underpinned at least in part by a psychopathological overlap between BED and ADHD, with the latter conceptualized as a cognitive control disorder that also benefits from treatment with lisdexamfetamine.

Lisdexamfetamine's therapeutic effects for BED primarily involve direct action in the central nervous system after conversion to its pharmacologically active metabolite, dextroamphetamine. Centrally, dextroamphetamine increases neurotransmitter activity of dopamine and norepinephrine in prefrontal cortical regions that regulate cognitive control of behavior. Similar to its therapeutic effect in ADHD, dextroamphetamine enhances cognitive control and may reduce impulsivity in patients with BED by enhancing the cognitive processes responsible for overriding prepotent feeding responses that precede binge eating episodes. Dextroamphetamine is also a full agonist of trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1), a G-protein coupled receptor that regulates monoaminergic systems in the brain; Activation of TAAR1 may restore impaired dopaminergic signaling in the prefrontal cortex and thereby correct deficits in inhibitory control associated with binge eating behaviors.  Beyond central nervous system mechanisms, peripheral actions of dextroamphetamine may also contribute to its treatment efficacy in BED. Through noradrenergic signaling pathways, dextroamphetamine triggers lipolysis in adipose fat cells, thereby prompting the release of triglycerides into blood plasma to be utilized as a fuel substrate. Moreover, dextroamphetamine induces synthesis of the cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART), a peptide neurotransmitter that regulates food intake. Within the hypothalamus, CART interacts with leptin signaling pathways to promote appetite suppression. Dextroamphetamine also activates TAAR1 in peripheral organs along the gastrointestinal tract that are involved in the regulation of food intake and body weight. Together, these actions confer an anorexigenic effect that promotes satiety in response to feeding and may decrease binge eating as a secondary effect. While lisdexamfetamine's anorexigenic effects contribute to its efficacy in BED, evidence indicates that the enhancement of cognitive control is necessary and sufficient for addressing the disorder's underlying psychopathology. This view is supported by the failure of anti-obesity medications and other appetite suppressants to significantly reduce BED symptom severity, despite their capacity to induce weight loss.
Medical reviews of randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that lisdexamfetamine, at doses between 50–70 mg, is safe and effective for the treatment of moderate-to-severe BED in adults. These reviews suggest that lisdexamfetamine is persistently effective at treating BED and is associated with significant reductions in the number of binge eating days and binge eating episodes per week. Furthermore, a meta-analytic systematic review highlighted an open-label, 12-month extension safety and tolerability study that reported lisdexamfetamine remained effective at reducing the number of binge eating days for the duration of the study. In addition, both a review and a meta-analytic systematic review found lisdexamfetamine to be superior to placebo in several secondary outcome measures, including persistent binge eating cessation, reduction of obsessive-compulsive related binge eating symptoms, reduction of body-weight, and reduction of triglycerides. Lisdexamfetamine, like all pharmaceutical amphetamines, has direct appetite suppressant effects that may be therapeutically useful in both BED and its comorbidities. Based on reviews of neuroimaging studies involving BED-diagnosed participants, therapeutic neuroplasticity in dopaminergic and noradrenergic pathways from long-term use of lisdexamfetamine may be implicated in lasting improvements in the regulation of eating behaviors that are observed.

#### Narcolepsy

Narcolepsy is a chronic sleep-wake disorder that is associated with excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy, and sleep paralysis. Patients with narcolepsy are diagnosed as either type 1 or type 2, with only the former presenting cataplexy symptoms. Type 1 narcolepsy results from the loss of approximately 70,000 orexin-releasing neurons in the lateral hypothalamus, leading to significantly reduced cerebrospinal orexin levels; this reduction is a diagnostic biomarker for type 1 narcolepsy. Lateral hypothalamic orexin neurons innervate every component of the ascending reticular activating system (ARAS), which includes noradrenergic, dopaminergic, histaminergic, and serotonergic nuclei that promote wakefulness.
Amphetamine's therapeutic mode of action in narcolepsy primarily involves increasing monoamine neurotransmitter activity in the ARAS. This includes noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus, dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area, histaminergic neurons in the tuberomammillary nucleus, and serotonergic neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus. Dextroamphetamine, the more dopaminergic enantiomer of amphetamine, is particularly effective at promoting wakefulness because dopamine release has the greatest influence on cortical activation and cognitive arousal, relative to other monoamines. In contrast, levoamphetamine may have a greater effect on cataplexy, a symptom more sensitive to the effects of norepinephrine and serotonin. Noradrenergic and serotonergic nuclei in the ARAS are involved in the regulation of the REM sleep cycle and function as "REM-off" cells, with amphetamine's effect on norepinephrine and serotonin contributing to the suppression of REM sleep and a possible reduction of cataplexy at high doses.
The American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) 2021 clinical practice guideline conditionally recommends dextroamphetamine for the treatment of both type 1 and type 2 narcolepsy. Treatment with pharmaceutical amphetamines is generally less preferred relative to other stimulants (e.g., modafinil) and is considered a third-line treatment option. Medical reviews indicate that amphetamine is safe and effective for the treatment of narcolepsy. Amphetamine appears to be most effective at improving symptoms associated with hypersomnolence, with three reviews finding clinically significant reductions in daytime sleepiness in patients with narcolepsy. Additionally, these reviews suggest that amphetamine may dose-dependently improve cataplexy symptoms. However, the quality of evidence for these findings is low and is consequently reflected in the AASM's conditional recommendation for dextroamphetamine as a treatment option for narcolepsy.

### Enhancing performance

#### Cognitive performance

In 2015, a systematic review and a meta-analysis of high quality clinical trials found that, when used at low (therapeutic) doses, amphetamine produces modest yet unambiguous improvements in cognition, including working memory, long-term episodic memory, inhibitory control, and some aspects of attention, in normal healthy adults; these cognition-enhancing effects of amphetamine are known to be partially mediated through the indirect activation of both dopamine D1 receptor and α2-adrenergic receptor in the prefrontal cortex. A systematic review from 2014 found that low doses of amphetamine also improve memory consolidation, in turn leading to improved recall of information. Therapeutic doses of amphetamine also enhance cortical network efficiency, an effect which mediates improvements in working memory in all individuals. Amphetamine and other ADHD stimulants also improve task saliency (motivation to perform a task) and increase arousal (wakefulness), in turn promoting goal-directed behavior. Stimulants such as amphetamine can improve performance on difficult and boring tasks and are used by some students as a study and test-taking aid. Based upon studies of self-reported illicit stimulant use, 5–35% of college students use diverted ADHD stimulants, which are primarily used for enhancement of academic performance rather than as recreational drugs. However, high amphetamine doses that are above the therapeutic range can interfere with working memory and other aspects of cognitive control.

#### Physical performance

Amphetamine is used by some athletes for its psychological and athletic performance-enhancing effects, such as increased endurance and alertness; however, non-medical amphetamine use is prohibited at sporting events that are regulated by collegiate, national, and international anti-doping agencies. In healthy people at oral therapeutic doses, amphetamine has been shown to increase muscle strength, acceleration, athletic performance in anaerobic conditions, and endurance (i.e., it delays the onset of fatigue), while improving reaction time. Amphetamine improves endurance and reaction time primarily through reuptake inhibition and release of dopamine in the central nervous system. Amphetamine and other dopaminergic drugs also increase power output at fixed levels of perceived exertion by overriding a "safety switch", allowing the core temperature limit to increase in order to access a reserve capacity that is normally off-limits. At therapeutic doses, the adverse effects of amphetamine do not impede athletic performance; however, at much higher doses, amphetamine can induce effects that severely impair performance, such as rapid muscle breakdown and elevated body temperature.

### Available forms

Lisdexamfetamine is available as the dimesylate salt in the form of both oral capsules and chewable tablets. A dose of 50 mg of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate is approximately equimolar to a 20 mg dose of dextroamphetamine sulfate or to 15 mg dextroamphetamine free-base in terms of the amount of dextroamphetamine contained. Lisdexamfetamine capsules can be swallowed intact, or they can be opened and mixed into water, yogurt, or applesauce and consumed in that manner.

## Contraindications

Pharmaceutical lisdexamfetamine is contraindicated in people with hypersensitivity to amphetamine products or any of the formulation's inactive ingredients. It is also contraindicated in patients who have used a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) within the last 14 days. Amphetamine products are contraindicated by the United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) in people with a history of drug abuse, heart disease, or severe agitation or anxiety, or in those currently experiencing arteriosclerosis, glaucoma, hyperthyroidism, or severe hypertension. However, a European consensus statement on adult ADHD noted that stimulants do not worsen substance misuse in adults with ADHD and comorbid substance use disorder and should not be avoided in these individuals. In any case, the statement noted that immediate-release stimulants should be avoided in those with both ADHD and substance use disorder and that slower-release stimulant formulations like OROSTooltip osmotic-controlled release oral delivery system methylphenidate (Concerta) and lisdexamfetamine should be preferred due to their lower misuse potential. Prescribing information approved by the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration further contraindicates anorexia.

## Adverse effects

Products containing lisdexamfetamine have a comparable drug safety profile to those containing amphetamine. The major side effects of lisdexamfetamine in short-term clinical trials (≥5% incidence) have included decreased appetite, insomnia, dry mouth, weight loss, irritability, upper abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, increased heart rate, anxiety, dizziness, and feeling jittery. Rates of side effects may vary in adults, adolescents, and children. Rare but serious side effects of lisdexamfetamine may include mania, sudden cardiac death in those with underlying heart problems, stimulant psychosis, and serotonin syndrome.

## Interactions

Acidifying agents: Drugs or foods that acidify the urine, such as ascorbic acid, increase urinary excretion of dextroamphetamine, thus decreasing the half-life and effectiveness of dextroamphetamine in the body.
Alkalinizing agents: Drugs or foods that alkalinize the urine, such as sodium bicarbonate, decrease urinary excretion of dextroamphetamine, thus increasing the half-life and effectiveness of dextroamphetamine in the body.
CYP2D6 inhibitors: Hydroxylation via the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2D6 is the major pathway of metabolism of dextroamphetamine. Potent CYP2D6 inhibitors, such as paroxetine, fluoxetine, bupropion, and duloxetine, among others, may inhibit the metabolism of dextroamphetamine and thereby increase exposure to it. Studies characterizing this potential interaction are currently lacking. Concomitant use of lisdexamfetamine with CYP2D6 inhibitors may increase the risk of serotonin syndrome due to greater drug exposure.
Monoamine oxidase inhibitors: Concomitant use of MAOIs and central nervous system stimulants such as lisdexamfetamine can cause a hypertensive crisis.
Norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (NRIs) like atomoxetine prevent norepinephrine release induced by amphetamines and have been found to reduce the stimulant, euphoriant, and sympathomimetic effects of dextroamphetamine in humans.

## Pharmacology

### Mechanism of action

Lisdexamfetamine is an inactive prodrug that is converted in the body to dextroamphetamine, a pharmacologically active compound that is responsible for the drug's activity. After oral ingestion, lisdexamfetamine is broken down by enzymes in red blood cells to form L-lysine, a naturally occurring essential amino acid, and dextroamphetamine. The half-life of this conversion is roughly 1 hour. The conversion of lisdexamfetamine to dextroamphetamine is not affected by gastrointestinal pH and is unlikely to be affected by alterations in normal gastrointestinal transit times. Studies show a linear relationship between peak plasma concentration of dextroamphetamine and lisdexamfetamine dose up to lisdexamfetamine doses of 250 mg.
The optical isomers of amphetamine, i.e., dextroamphetamine and levoamphetamine, are TAAR1 agonists and vesicular monoamine transporter 2 inhibitors that can enter monoamine neurons; this allows them to release monoamine neurotransmitters (dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin, among others) from their storage sites in the presynaptic neuron, as well as prevent the reuptake of these neurotransmitters from the synaptic cleft.
Lisdexamfetamine was developed to provide a long-duration effect that is consistent throughout the day, with reduced potential for abuse. The attachment of the amino acid lysine slows down the relative amount of dextroamphetamine available in the bloodstream. Because no free dextroamphetamine is present in lisdexamfetamine capsules, dextroamphetamine does not become available through mechanical manipulation, such as crushing or simple extraction. Lisdexamfetamine is a single-enantiomer dextroamphetamine formula similar to Dexedrine but opposed to other amphetamine based pharmaceuticals such as Adderall, which contains both dextroamphetamine and levoamphetamine at a 3:1 ratio, or racemic mixtures like Evekeo and the presently discontinued Benzedrine which are amphetamine salts with a 1:1 enantiomer ratio. Studies conducted show that lisdexamfetamine may have less abuse potential than dextroamphetamine and an abuse profile similar to diethylpropion at dosages that are FDA-approved for treatment of ADHD, but still has a high abuse potential when this dosage is exceeded by over 100%.

### Pharmacokinetics

The oral bioavailability of amphetamine varies with gastrointestinal pH; it is well absorbed from the gut, and bioavailability is typically 90%. Amphetamine is a weak base with a pKa of 9.9; consequently, when the pH is basic, more of the drug is in its lipid soluble free base form, and more is absorbed through the lipid-rich cell membranes of the gut epithelium. Conversely, an acidic pH means the drug is predominantly in a water-soluble cationic (salt) form, and less is absorbed. Approximately 20% of amphetamine circulating in the bloodstream is bound to plasma proteins. Following absorption, amphetamine readily distributes into most tissues in the body, with high concentrations occurring in cerebrospinal fluid and brain tissue.
The half-lives of amphetamine enantiomers differ and vary with urine pH. At normal urine pH, the half-lives of dextroamphetamine and levoamphetamine are 9–11 hours and 11–14 hours, respectively. Highly acidic urine will reduce the enantiomer half-lives to 7 hours; highly alkaline urine will increase the half-lives up to 34 hours. The immediate-release and extended release variants of salts of both isomers reach peak plasma concentrations at 3 hours and 7 hours post-dose respectively. Amphetamine is eliminated via the kidneys, with 30–40% of the drug being excreted unchanged at normal urinary pH. When the urinary pH is basic, amphetamine is in its free base form, so less is excreted. When urine pH is abnormal, the urinary recovery of amphetamine may range from a low of 1% to a high of 75%, depending mostly upon whether urine is too basic or acidic, respectively. Following oral administration, amphetamine appears in urine within 3 hours. Roughly 90% of ingested amphetamine is eliminated 3 days after the last oral dose. 
Lisdexamfetamine is a prodrug of dextroamphetamine. It is not as sensitive to pH as amphetamine when being absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract. Following absorption into the blood stream, lisdexamfetamine is completely converted by red blood cells to dextroamphetamine and the amino acid L-lysine by hydrolysis via undetermined aminopeptidase enzymes. This is the rate-limiting step in the bioactivation of lisdexamfetamine. The elimination half-life of lisdexamfetamine is generally less than 1 hour. Due to the necessary conversion of lisdexamfetamine into dextroamphetamine, levels of dextroamphetamine with lisdexamfetamine peak about one hour later than with an equivalent dose of immediate-release dextroamphetamine. Presumably due to its rate-limited activation by red blood cells, intravenous administration of lisdexamfetamine shows greatly delayed time to peak and reduced peak levels compared to intravenous administration of an equivalent dose of dextroamphetamine. The pharmacokinetics of lisdexamfetamine are similar regardless of whether it is administered orally, intranasally, or intravenously. Hence, in contrast to dextroamphetamine, parenteral use does not enhance the subjective effects of lisdexamfetamine. Because of its behavior as a prodrug and its pharmacokinetic differences, lisdexamfetamine has a longer duration of therapeutic effect than immediate-release dextroamphetamine and shows reduced misuse potential.
CYP2D6, dopamine β-hydroxylase (DBH), flavin-containing monooxygenase 3 (FMO3), butyrate-CoA ligase (XM-ligase), and glycine N-acyltransferase (GLYAT) are the enzymes known to metabolize amphetamine or its metabolites in humans. Amphetamine has a variety of excreted metabolic products, including 4-hydroxyamphetamine, 4-hydroxynorephedrine, 4-hydroxyphenylacetone, benzoic acid, hippuric acid, norephedrine, and phenylacetone. Among these metabolites, the active sympathomimetics are 4-hydroxyamphetamine, 4-hydroxynorephedrine, and norephedrine. The main metabolic pathways involve aromatic para-hydroxylation, aliphatic alpha- and beta-hydroxylation, N-oxidation, N-dealkylation, and deamination. The known metabolic pathways, detectable metabolites, and metabolizing enzymes in humans include the following:

## Chemistry

Lisdexamfetamine is a substituted amphetamine with an amide linkage formed by the condensation of dextroamphetamine with the carboxylate group of the essential amino acid L-lysine. The reaction occurs with retention of stereochemistry, so the product lisdexamfetamine exists as a single stereoisomer. There are many possible names for lisdexamfetamine based on IUPAC nomenclature, but it is usually named as N-[(2S)-1-phenyl-2-propanyl]-L-lysinamide or (2S)-2,6-diamino-N-[(1S)-1-methyl-2-phenylethyl]hexanamide. The condensation reaction occurs with loss of water:

(S)-PhCH2CH(CH3)NH2   +   (S)-HOOCCH(NH2)CH2CH2CH2CH2NH2   →   (S,S)-PhCH2CH(CH3)NHC(O)CH(NH2)CH2CH2CH2CH2NH2   +   H2O
Amine functional groups are vulnerable to oxidation in air and so pharmaceuticals containing them are usually formulated as salts where this moiety has been protonated. This increases stability, water solubility, and, by converting a molecular compound to an ionic compound, increases the melting point and thereby ensures a solid product. In the case of lisdexamfetamine, this is achieved by reacting with two equivalents of methanesulfonic acid to produce the dimesylate salt, a water-soluble (792 mg mL−1) powder with a white to off-white color.

PhCH2CH(CH3)NHC(O)CH(NH2)CH2CH2CH2CH2NH2   +   2 CH3SO3H   →   [PhCH2CH(CH3)NHC(O)CH(NH+3)CH2CH2CH2CH2NH+3][CH3SO−3]2

### Comparison to other formulations

Lisdexamfetamine dimesylate is one marketed formulation delivering dextroamphetamine. The following table compares the drug to other amphetamine pharmaceuticals.

## History

Lisdexamfetamine was developed by Robert Oberlender at New River Pharmaceuticals, under the name NRP104, before being bought by Takeda Pharmaceuticals through its acquisition of Shire Pharmaceuticals, prior to market release. It was developed to create a longer-lasting and less-easily abused version of dextroamphetamine, as the requirement of conversion into dextroamphetamine via enzymes in the red blood cells delays its onset of action, regardless of the route of administration.
In February 2007, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved lisdexamfetamine for the treatment of ADHD. In August 2009, Health Canada approved the marketing of lisdexamfetamine for prescription use.
In January 2015, lisdexamfetamine was approved by the FDA for the treatment of binge eating disorder in adults.
The FDA gave tentative approval to generic formulations of lisdexamfetamine in 2015. The expiration date for patent protection of lisdexamfetamine in the US was 24 February 2023. The Canadian patent expired 20 years from the filing date of 1 June 2004.
Production quotas for 2016 in the United States were 29,750 kg.

## Research

### Depression

Amphetamine was used to treat depression starting in the 1930s and has been described as the first antidepressant. In clinical studies in the 1970s and 1980s, psychostimulants, including amphetamine and methylphenidate, were found to transiently improve mood in a majority of people with depression and to increase psychomotor activation in almost all individuals.
Some clinical trials that used lisdexamfetamine as an add-on therapy with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) for treatment-resistant depression indicated that this is no more effective than the use of an SSRI or SNRI alone. Other studies indicated that psychostimulants potentiated antidepressants, and were under-prescribed for treatment-resistant depression. In those studies, patients showed significant improvement in energy, mood, and psychomotor activity. Clinical guidelines advise caution in the use of stimulants for depression and advise them only as second- or third-line adjunctive agents.
In February 2014, Shire announced that two late-stage clinical trials had found that Vyvanse was not an effective treatment for depression, and development for this indication was discontinued. A 2018 meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials of lisdexamfetamine for antidepressant augmentation in people with major depressive disorder—the first to be conducted—found that lisdexamfetamine was not significantly better than placebo in improving Montgomery–Åsberg Depression Rating Scale scores, response rates, or remission rates. However, there was indication of a small effect in improving depressive symptoms that approached trend-level significance. Lisdexamfetamine was well-tolerated in the meta-analysis. The quantity of evidence was limited, with only four trials included. In a subsequent 2022 network meta-analysis, lisdexamfetamine was significantly effective as an antidepressant augmentation for treatment-resistant depression.
Although lisdexamfetamine has shown limited effectiveness in the treatment of depression in clinical trials, a phase II clinical study found that the addition of lisdexamfetamine to an antidepressant improved executive dysfunction in people with mild major depressive disorder but persisting executive dysfunction.
