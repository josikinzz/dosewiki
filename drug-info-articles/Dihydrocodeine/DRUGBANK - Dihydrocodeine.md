# Dihydrocodeine
*Source: https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB01551*

## Overview

### Description

This compound belongs to the class of organic compounds known as morphinans. These are polycyclic compounds with a four-ring skeleton with three condensed six-member rings forming a partially hydrogenated phenanthrene moiety, one of which is aromatic while the two others are alicyclic.

### Background

Dihydrocodeine is an opioid analgesic used as an alternative or adjunct to codeine to treat moderate to severe pain, severe dyspnea, and cough.
It is semi-synthetic, and was developed in Germany in 1908 during an international search to find a more effective antitussive agent to help reduce the spread of airborne infectious diseases such as tuburculosis. It was marketed in 1911.

### Indication

Dihydrocodeine is used for the treatment of moderate to severe pain, including post-operative and dental pain [2]. It  can also be used to treat chronic pain [1], breathlessness and coughing.
In heroin addicts, dihydrocodeine has been used as a substitute drug, in doses up to 2500mg/day to treat addiction. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2014322/]

### Pharmacodynamics

Possible opioid related side effects include, but are not limited to, drowsiness, nausea, headache, dry mouth, constipation, difficulty passing urine, and mild euphoria.

### Mechanism of Action

Mu-type opioid receptor
Antagonist

### Absorption

Bioavailability is low (approximately 20%) if administered orally. This may be due to poor gastrointestinal absorption. It is also likely due to pre-systemic metabolism by the liver and intestinal wall. [2]
The AUCs after oral and intravenous administration are similar (3203ug/l/h and 3401ug/l/h, respectively). [2]
Time to peak values are 1.6 and 1.8hours for a 30mg and 60mg dose, respectively. The concentrations achieved were 71.8 ug/1 and 146 ug/1, respectively. [2]

### Metabolism

Metabolized in the liver by CYP 2D6 into an active metabolite, dihydromorphine, and by CYP 3A4 into secondary primary metabolite, nordihydrocodeine. A third primary metabolite is dihydrocodeine-6-glucuronide. [1]
The time for mean peak concentration in acid metabolites is 1.76h and 1.98h for a 30 and 60mg dose, respectively. The concentrations achieved were 563 ug/1 and 1476 ug/1, respectively. [2]

### Half-life

4h

### Drug Interactions

This information should not be interpreted without the help of a healthcare provider. If you believe you are experiencing an interaction, contact a healthcare provider immediately. The absence of an interaction does not necessarily mean no interactions exist.

1,2-Benzodiazepine
The risk or severity of adverse effects can be increased when Dihydrocodeine is combined with 1,2-Benzodiazepine.
Abametapir
The serum concentration of Dihydrocodeine can be increased when it is combined with Abametapir.
Abatacept
The metabolism of Dihydrocodeine can be increased when combined with Abatacept.
Abiraterone
The metabolism of Dihydrocodeine can be decreased when combined with Abiraterone.
Acebutolol
The metabolism of Dihydrocodeine can be decreased when combined with Acebutolol.

### Food Interactions

Avoid alcohol. Alcohol can enhance the CNS depressant effects of this drug.

### Mechanism of action

Dihydrocodeine is metabolized to dihydromorphine -- a highly active metabolite with a high affinity for mu opioid receptors. [3]
Target
Actions
Organism
A
Mu-type opioid receptor
antagonist
Humans

### Volume of distribution

The disposition of dihydrocodeine is described as a two compartment model. [2]

### Route of elimination

Renal elimination and urinary excretion. [1]

### Clearance

Plasma clearance is approximately 300ml/min. [2]
The pharmacokinetics of dihydrocodeine and active metabolite dihydromorphine have been reported to be linear. [1]
The decline in plasma dihydrocodeine concentrations after intravenous administration has been described as bi-exponential, with a sleep decline in the initial 2h following administration, followed by a mono-exponential decline thereafter. Clearance was not dose dependent. [2]

### Curator comments

Dihydrocodeine is metabolized to dihydromorphine. It does not bind directly to Mu-type opioid receptors.

### General Function

A cytochrome P450 monooxygenase involved in the metabolism of fatty acids, steroids and retinoids (PubMed:18698000, PubMed:19965576, PubMed:20972997, PubMed:21289075, PubMed:21576599). Mechanistically, uses molecular oxygen inserting one oxygen atom into a substrate, and reducing the second into a water molecule, with two electrons provided by NADPH via cytochrome P450 reductase (NADPH--hemoprotein reductase) (PubMed:18698000, PubMed:19965576, PubMed:20972997, PubMed:21289075, PubMed:21576599). Catalyzes the epoxidation of double bonds of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) (PubMed:19965576, PubMed:20972997). Metabolizes endocannabinoid arachidonoylethanolamide (anandamide) to 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid ethanolamide (20-HETE-EA) and 8,9-, 11,12-, and 14,15-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid ethanolamides (EpETrE-EAs), potentially modulating endocannabinoid system signaling (PubMed:18698000, PubMed:21289075). Catalyzes the hydroxylation of carbon-hydrogen bonds. Metabolizes cholesterol toward 25-hydroxycholesterol, a physiological regulator of cellular cholesterol homeostasis (PubMed:21576599). Catalyzes the oxidative transformations of all-trans retinol to all-trans retinal, a precursor for the active form all-trans-retinoic acid (PubMed:10681376). Also involved in the oxidative metabolism of drugs such as antiarrhythmics, adrenoceptor antagonists, and tricyclic antidepressants
