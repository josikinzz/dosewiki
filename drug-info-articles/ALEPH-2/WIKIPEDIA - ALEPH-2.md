Aleph-2, or ALEPH-2, also known as 4-ethylthio-2,5-dimethoxyamphetamine, is a psychedelic drug of the phenethylamine, amphetamine, and DOx families. It is one of the Aleph series of compounds.

## Use and effects

In his book PiHKAL (Phenethylamines I Have Known and Loved), Alexander Shulgin lists Aleph-2's dose as 4 to 8 mg orally and its duration as 8 to 16 hours. The effects of Aleph-2 have been reported to include "almost no visual phenomena" to "extraordinary visuals and interpretations", visual distortion and movement, enhanced auditory and tactile perception, and a sensation of physical warmth, and residual shakiness and muscle tremors, among others. There is an unpredictability with the dosing and effects of Aleph-2, such that one person who took 4 mg had strong effects including ending up in a fetal position, in relative hibernation for several hours, and with substantial amnesia, whereas another person who took 8 mg experienced only a bare threshold including slight lightheadedness.
