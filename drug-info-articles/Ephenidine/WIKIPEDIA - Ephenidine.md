Ephenidine (also known as NEDPA and EPE) is a dissociative anesthetic that has been sold online as a designer drug. It is illegal in some countries as a structural isomer of the banned opioid drug lefetamine, but has been sold in countries where it is not yet banned.

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

Ephenidine and related diarylethylamines have been studied in vitro as treatments for neurotoxic injuries, and are antagonists of the NMDA receptor (Ki = 66.4 nM for ephenidine). Ephenidine also possesses weaker affinity for dopamine and norepinephrine transporters (379 nM and 841 nM, respectively) as well as σ1R (629 nM) and σ2R (722 nM) binding sites.

### Pharmacokinetics

### Metabolism

Ephenidine's metabolic pathway consists of N-oxidation, N-dealkylation, mono- and bis-hydroxylation of the benzyl ring, and hydroxylation of the phenyl ring only after N-dealkylation. The dihydroxy metabolites were conjugated by methylation of one hydroxy group, and hydroxy metabolites by glucuronidation or sulfation.

## Chemistry

Ephenidine reacts with reagent testing kits to give a semi-unique array of colors which can be used to aid its identification.

## Society and culture

Sweden's public health agency suggested that ephenidine be classified as a hazardous substance on 1 June, 2015. Due to that suggestion, ephenidine became a scheduled substance, in Sweden, as of 18 August, 2015.
In 2016, Canada added MT-45 and "its salts, derivatives, isomers and analogues" to the Schedule I controlled substance list, and explicitly included ephenidine. Possession without legal authority can result in maximum 7 years imprisonment.
