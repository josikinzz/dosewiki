## Subjective Experience

Mexedrone’s release in 2015 was accompanied by a sustained period of Internet
generated hype. This included the suggestion of close association with mephedrone,
with domain names even being registered along these lines (e.g. mcat2.com). Market
expectation was therefore extremely high.

However, it was to prove to be disappointing, with only mild effects, and for many,
none whatsoever.

The following is a compressed version of my own trip report from that time, as
posted on a popular forum:

```
A joy of a short acting RC is that it can be experienced during a smaller
window of opportunity. Courtesy of a sample generously provided by a well
known vendor, I was able to perform such a test yesterday afternoon.
```
```
My chosen RoA was not my usual preference, which is oral. I insufflated
simply because I had eaten a heavy lunch, which I felt might dilute the effect
of the drug.
```
```
T+0.00 I crush the crystals and insufflate 50mg to establish the broad
headspace and the feel of the experience.
```
```
T+0.05 I sense my mood being gently elevated. There is no stimulation
at this point, just a barely perceptible shift towards positivity.
```
```
T+0.30. As the same sort of mild background feeling has persisted for
the best part of half an hour, I insufflate a further 100mg.
```
```
T+1.00 The warm positive feel has returned but it is a little stronger. It
is quite nice, which is perhaps the best description I can find. There is a
minor mood enhancement and a warm pleasant feeling compared to
base.
```
```
I insufflated a couple more 100mg lines during the course of the afternoon,
bringing the grand total to 350mg. There was no major urge to redose, but I
chose to push a little further out of curiosity. The effects tapered off during the
evening.
```
```
At these levels this won't blow your socks off. It isn't stimulating and doesn't
lift you to the clouds. I do not say this negatively, just factually. The biggest
problem this chemical faces is going to be expectation, due to its marketing
alignment with 4-MMC. Further, it just isn’t very strong.
```
```
I can see why some people suggest similarity to MDAI, but I found it to subtly
different, with a little more clarity of mind, and significantly less empathy.
```
```
I liked the short duration: for my current lifestyle, writing off a full day, and
potentially a night’s sleep, is difficult. For recreation, this can be slipped in for
just a few hours, and is totally functional in social situations.
```
```
Contrary to my expectation, the night's sleep was not the best, and this
morning I could still feel that I had recently consumed a chemical. This wasn’t
terrible, but it was noticeable. Perhaps there was some (latent) stimulation in
this after all.
```
Mexedrone was one of those releases which attracted undue positivity; partly
because it was legally and easily available, and partly due to the hype. It wasn't even
close to being a mephedrone replacement, and its mild effects were such that I would
seriously question its value in terms of a risk/benefit (much of the risk being that it
was a new untested chemical). It certainly isn't one which I would ever use again.
