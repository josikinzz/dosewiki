## Subjective Experience

The chief commercial crop for tobacco is nicotiana tabacum, which contains the
active alkaloid, nicotine. It is one of the most commonly used drugs in the world, and
is sold legally throughout the world, with an estimated one billion active smokers.

Despite this, I have to admit that I don’t get it. I don’t understand why so many
people use this other than to initially experiment, once or twice.

For me, it produces an extremely mild stimulation and a very slight mood lift,
followed by a little sedation. None of this is significant enough to return to, especially
with so many more-worthwhile and less-toxic options available.

I have always felt like this. I sampled it a few times in different forms as a youngster,
fortunately not frequently enough to become addicted. Whilst I have occasionally
smoked it pre-rolled with cannabis (more through necessity than choice), I have
never been even slightly tempted by the tobacco.

My own lack of interest, however, certainly doesn’t diminish my responsibility to
point out the acute danger posed by its use.

The World Health Organisation states bluntly that:

\`\`\`
“Tobacco kills around 6 million people each year. More than 5 million of
those deaths are the result of direct tobacco use while more than 600,000 are
the result of non-smokers being exposed to second-hand smoke”
\`\`\`
In the US, the CDC states that:

\`\`\`
“Cigarette smoking is estimated to cause ... more than 480,000 deaths
annually (including deaths from second hand smoke)”
\`\`\`
And that:

\`\`\`
“Life expectancy for smokers is at least 10 years shorter than for non-
smokers”
\`\`\`
In the UK, ASH reports that:

\`\`\`
"Smoking is the primary cause of preventable illness and premature death,
accounting for approximately 96,000 deaths a year".
\`\`\`
I am sure that there is little need to further labour the acute perils and pitfalls of
using this drug, as they are so well known. The negative imbalance of risk versus
pleasure should already be obvious to all.

If you don’t smoke, don’t start. If you do smoke, support is available from a variety of
sources to help you stop, including from government websites.
[http://smokefree.gov (US) and [http://www.nhs.uk/smokefree](http://www.nhs.uk/smokefree) (UK)]

For the record, for the opening photographs on the previous page I purchased a
packet of 10 cigarettes from my local supermarket (Tesco), at a cost of £3.60
(January 2017). The sales assistant assured me that these were the cheapest “normal
cigarettes” on offer and that they were very popular.

\`\`\`
In some parts of the world (tobacco) cigarettes are still sold
freely via public vending machines (Tokyo, 2017)
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
A specialised market has long existed for various types of smoking tobacco,
particularly when sold as cigars (P.G.C. Hajenius, Amsterdam, 2017)
\`\`\`

\`\`\`
A hookah, also known as a shisha or a waterpipe, utilises water filtration and is
frequently used to smoke tobacco mixed with flavouring, fruit or other ingredients.
I used this particular device in a restaurant in the middle-east
\`\`\`

In the modern era many people vape their nicotine, and as per this photograph,
taken in a Dutch vape shop, a wide selection of flavours and tastes are available for
the discerning user.

SNUFF & SNUS
Although tobacco is almost universally associated with smoking and vaping, it is
sometimes consumed via other methods, notably as snuff and snus:

\`\`\`
Snuff (finely ground tobacco leaves) is sniffed or inhaled into the nasal cavity,
providing a rapid hit. Again, I experimented with this form in my youth. I
recall a sort of immediate head shock, after which I sneezed and wheezed to
expel the residue powder.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
Snus originated from snuff in the early 18th century, and is consumed
sublabially (placed between the lip and gum). It is particularly popular in
Sweden. Variants of this include dipping tobacco and naswar (the latter is
largely used in Afghanistan).
\`\`\`
It’s worth noting that the intake options (for various purposes) don’t end here.
Indeed, Wikipedia informs us that:

\`\`\`
“Tobacco smoke enemas were employed by the indigenous peoples of North
America to stimulate respiration, injecting the smoke with a rectal tube.”
\`\`\`
This is probably a good point at which to end this segment.

ADDENDUM: THE SNUS EXPERIENCE
Having a few hours to spare whilst in Copenhagen, I hopped over to Sweden
specifically to sample snus at its global epicentre. On arrival I quickly found a
tobacconist and asked for the most traditional and popular variety. I was provided
with the following, which the proprietor described as “a gentleman’s original snus”:

On leaving the shop I placed one of those packets between my gum and upper lip,
and held it there for some minutes. It was hot and burning, and the taste, which ran
down the back of my throat, wasn’t at all nice. I held on but it didn’t get any better.

Five minutes in I was feeling a little sickly and dizzy, and had to expel it and sit down.
There was stimulation present, but the icky feel was primary. On nine minutes I was
feeling pretty sorry for myself. The dizziness was now worse, and the rather poorly
background had not dissipated in the least.

Did I get any sympathy from my patiently waiting colleague? Not exactly: I was told
that I was an a\$\$ehole. This at least made me chuckle.

The good news is that at twenty minutes I felt that I was on the road to recovery, even
though I still felt ill and just wanted to curl up in a bed. After half an hour, although I
hadn’t recovered I was well enough to walk again and continue with my day.

This was definitely not one for me. It was, perhaps unsurprisingly, like a diluted re-
run of my mapacho and rapé experiences. Note that I discerned no lag or after
effects, either during the afternoon or the following day.

If I have failed to do justice to this, please bear in mind that I am not a smoker (of
tobacco). This was way too much for my disposition.

### 4. WORLDSCAPE: THE WIDER CONTEXT

The drugscape does not exist in a vacuum, and neither do you. The world you are
part of encompasses society and culture, legal implications, travel, personal
responsibilities, sources of help and assistance, terminology and slang, and a myriad
of other complex and omnipresent phenomena.

This section seeks to provide background, guidance, and direct information relevant
to drug use in the wider context, as well as direction on where to obtain further
material and knowledge. It offers practical data and reference material to help
manage all the above, and hopefully to successfully navigate any emerging problems
or issues.

Again, this is intended to cut through the misinformation and propaganda of
mainstream sources, and focuses upon the factual and the accurate. Used in
conjunction with the earlier sections, it may help you to avoid many of the pitfalls
which are encountered by the unwary all too frequently.

THE WORLDSCAPE
The worldscape is documented via the following sub-sections:

\`\`\`
4.1 How Many People Use Drugs?
4.2 The Relative Harm
4.3 Addiction & Overdose
4.4 The LawScape
4.5 Drug Tourism
4.5 Culture & Society (Reference)
4.7 Confessions of a Lab Rat
4.8 Argot
4.9 Internet Resources
4.10 Supplementary Notes
4.11 Supplementary Photographs
4.12 Namaste: A Final Note
\`\`\`
EDUCATION & AWARENESS
Remember that education and awareness are the first steps to mitigate risks,
including to your general welfare and well being. Don’t shortcut this section and
don’t shortcut the safety measures documented through the rest of this book.

Any updates to this information will be posted on the website:

[The WorldScape]

4.1 HOW MANY PEOPLE USE DRUGS?

In the UK, the Home Office, in its 2015 Crime Survey for England & Wales, stated
that 8.6% of adults aged 16 to 59 “had taken an illicit drug in the last year”. This was
similar to previous years, and equates to about 2.9 million people. Illicit presumably
means illegal.

It also stated that “3.2% of adults aged 16 to 59 had taken a Class A drug in the last
year, equivalent to just over one million people”. It added “2.2% of adults aged 16 to
59 were classed as frequent drug users (having taken any illicit drug more than
once a month on average in the last year).”

One of the most comprehensive international studies I found was undertaken on
behalf of the National Institute of Drug Abuse, in the US. This surveyed 44,892
students from 382 public and private schools.

When asked which drugs they had used in the previous 12 months, the 17-18 year
olds (12th Graders) within this number responded as follows:

As there are estimated to be about 4 million 12th Graders, this would equate to about
1.4 million marijuana users, 200,000 users of hallucinogens, and so forth. A crude
extrapolation of this percentage to the entire US population provides a figure of over
100 million marijuana users.

If that sounds like an astonishing figure, it does go some way to explain why, at time
of writing, approximately 750,000 people are arrested every year for marijuana
offences (source: FBI). Overall, in the US almost half a million people are
incarcerated for drug offences (source: The Sentencing Project, 2014), and on
average someone is arrested for drug possession every 25 seconds.

Whilst they provide insight, statistics like these barely scratch the surface,
particularly as most studies tend not to include the use of legal psychoactives and
emerging research chemicals.

[The WorldScape]

THE EMCDDA
The European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) was
inaugurated as an EU agency in 1995. It exists to provide the EU and its member
states with a factual overview of European drug problems and a solid evidence base
to support the drugs debate.

The following data was published by the EMCDDA in 2016. It details the percentage
of adults (15-64) from the stated samples who have used illegal drugs. Note that, with
respect to the United Kingdom, this does not include those drugs made illegal
subsequent to the passing of the Psychoactive Substances Act 2016.

\`\`\`
Source: http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/data/stats2016#displayTable:GPS-113
\`\`\`
From this, for example, it can be deduced via extrapolation that, if identified by their
government, more than one third of the UK‘s entire population could be criminalized
for their use of drugs. Numerically, this is in excess of 22 million people.

[The WorldScape]

THE UNITED NATIONS
The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) presented the following
picture of global drug use in its World Drug Report 2016:

\`\`\`
“It is estimated that 1 in 20 adults, or a quarter of a billion people between
the ages of 15 and 64 years, used at least one drug in 2014. Roughly the
equivalent of the combined populations of France, Germany, Italy and the
United Kingdom.”
\`\`\`
A later reference within the same report was even more precise:

\`\`\`
“247 million people used drugs in the past year”.
\`\`\`
In terms of specific psychoactives, it cited cannabis and amphetamines as the two
most popular drugs, with an estimated 183 million and 33 million global users
respectively.

Finally, it stated that the number of drug users was stable, and “does not seem to
have grown over the past four years in proportion to the global population”.

SUMMARY
In summary, there is no doubt that a significant minority of the world’s population
choose to use some form of unsanctioned psychoactive substance. This is despite the
unremitting propaganda and brutal punitive onslaught of the war on drugs.

Equally, the vast majority of those 247 million people are, in practical terms, denied
the basic safety information and education which would, in many cases, help to save
lives and alleviate risk. They are unaware of precisely the sort of directly relevant
material which is published in this book.

[The WorldScape]

A CURIOSITY: THE POPULARITY OF DRUGS RANKED BY NATION
In 2014 the UNODC published an interactive map which presented the estimated
relative popularity of certain drugs in each country (percentage use by its respective
adult population). This is clearly quite an old study now, and some of the data was
even older than this, but it does provide an interesting picture/snapshot.

The top 10 territories in terms of percentage use of each of the named drugs were:

The complete dataset from which this was derived can be viewed on the UNODC
website, here:

[The WorldScape]

4.2 THE RELATIVE HARM

Obscured by the endless stream of hysteria, misinformation and outright lies, which
have been promulgated by the mainstream media* for generations, are the answers to
the most fundamental of questions:

\`\`\`
What are the relative harms of the most commonly used psychoactives?
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
What does the DATA actually say?
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
What does SCIENCE tell us?
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
What are the FACTS?
\`\`\`
Every adolescent who has ever dabbled with cannabis already has some sort of a
handle on this. Their own experience and those of their peers directly contradicts the
propagandistic mendacity they have been subjected to. They are aware that the drugs
they have personally encountered are not the toxically guaranteed path to a wasted
life they are presented as.

Simultaneously, they can see the perils of alcohol with their own eyes. Often, the
debris and fallout is all around them.

Hardly surprisingly, this real world picture of first hand experience is broadly the one
which scientific studies substantiate and confirm. It is a stark and clear picture: a
picture which is generally hidden from the public at large.

SCIENTIFIC APPROACHES
There are many approaches with which to measure the relative harms of individual
psychoactives. These range from those focused upon the individual, such as addiction
potential and toxicity, to those which address wider social issues, such as crime and
healthcare. By and large, it is fair to say that the ranking of commonly used
substances (legal and illegal) does not differ dramatically between them.

To illustrate this, I present below data from a number of the studies which have been
undertaken over the years, some of which has been reported and submitted directly
to Parliament.

The first illustration uses data sourced from a paper by Robert S. Gable, called
"Comparison of acute lethal toxicity of commonly abused psychoactive substances",
which was published by the Society for the Study of Addiction, in 2004. This presents
the ratio of effective dose to lethal dose.

* Honourable exceptions acknowledged.

[The WorldScape]

In plain English, whilst two drinks may make you merry, twenty may well kill you.
Hence, the ratio for alcohol in this diagram is 1:10.

Now consider the following graph. The underlying data was produced by Prof David
J Nutt, FMed, Leslie A King, PhD, Lawrence D Phillips, PhD, on behalf of the
Independent Scientific Committee on Drugs and was published in The
Lancet,Volume 376, No. 9752, p1558–1565, 6 November 2010 (Drug harms in the
UK: a multicriteria decision analysis).

[The WorldScape]

The methodology was described thus: "Members of the Independent Scientific
Committee on Drugs, including two invited specialists, met in a 1-day interactive
workshop to score 20 drugs on 16 criteria: nine related to the harms that a drug
produces in the individual and seven to the harms to others. Drugs were scored out
of 100 points, and the criteria were weighted to indicate their relative importance."

Wikipedia describes this as follows:
"Researchers asked drug-harm experts to rank these illegal and legal drugs on
various measures of harm both to the user and to others in society. These measures
include damage to health, drug dependency, economic costs and crime. The
researchers claim that the rankings are stable because they are based on so many
different measures and would require significant discoveries about these drugs to
affect the rankings."

[The WorldScape]

The graphic below was produced from data offered in another article published by
The Lancet, this one on March 24, 2007, by Prof David Nutt, FMed, Leslie A King,
PhD, William Saulsbury, MA, Prof Colin Blakemore, FRS ("Development of a
rational scale to assess the harm of drugs of potential misuse" - 369:1047-1053).

\`\`\`
[Ref: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:20drugs.png]
\`\`\`
Finally, the following two charts were created simply to illustrate a couple of
extremes, in terms of drug use and fatality.

[The WorldScape]

\`\`\`
Annual Drug Deaths in the United States

\`\`\`
[Source Data: Schaffer Library of Drug Policy]
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
Annual Drug Deaths in the United Kingdom
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
[Source Data: Office of National Statistics]
\`\`\`
The picture presented by all these charts is more or less the same as that painted by
every study I encountered. The implications of this are obvious:

\`\`\`
 The legal status of psychoactives bears no relation whatsoever to harm or
health. This could hardly be more clear-cut.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
 In terms of personal harm, the usual suspects (e.g. heroin, alcohol) are at the
same end of the spectrum. Psychedelics, of course, are at the opposite end.
\`\`\`
Whilst each chemical and botanical should always be researched on its own merits,
data such as this is hard to ignore, unless you are a politician or part of the
mainstream media.

[The WorldScape]

4.3 Addiction & Overdose

Addiction and overdose are, without doubt, absolute nightmares for all involved.
They are to be avoided at all costs, or addressed urgently if applicable.

4.3.1 Addiction

Nobody becomes addicted through choice. It is a hazard which is endemic to the use
of most drugs, although not all. However, even for the most addictive of drugs, it is a
risk that can be reduced (but not eliminated) if the steps outlined in the first section
of this book are religiously followed.

For example, to mitigate the risk during the research undertaken for this book, I
never, ever, used the same drug, or even a drug from the same class, for at least two
weeks following the initial experiment. Invariably, the gap was substantially longer.

In recent years, various parties have sought to rank common drugs by order of
addiction potential. As referenced earlier, the usual suspects tend to appear at the
top. The table below presents some of the most frequently cited initiatives:

\`\`\`
The Conversation Addiction Center AlterNet
1 Heroin Heroin Heroin
2 Cocaine Alcohol Crack Cocaine
3 Nicotine Cocaine Nicotine
4 Barbiturates Barbiturates Methadone
5 Alcohol Nicotine Crystal Meth
*The list produced by The Conversation was derived from the same 2007
articles in the Lancet as discussed in Section 4.2. The AlterNet report refers to
the source as a panel of Dutch Scientists, which replicated the earlier study.
\`\`\`
As these are somewhat stilted towards individual and transient street names, a better
perspective may be to consider each as a representative of a class. For example,
heroin is an opioid - other members of the family tend to be just as addictive.

These, however, are simply the headliners. Everyone is different, and is uniquely
susceptible. Many drugs not included on these lists are just as addictive, and claim
countless lives.

This is not an area in which to take risks, or to betray common sense. Every person
reading this should know the dire consequences of addiction, and the gravity of the
pain and suffering it causes. If in doubt, head over to YouTube or Google and take a
closer look at the personal catastrophes and the destruction of lives on show. Or
check out Reddit, and count the number of lost Subreddit members.

Don’t skirt around the edges with this, or you could easily be bitten, horribly.

[The WorldScape]

4.3.2 If You Are Addicted

How do you know if you are addicted? If you are asking this question, it is extremely
likely that you have a problem, in which case, do not skip or skim this section.

The commonly suggested approaches to address addiction are:

\`\`\`
 Cold Turkey
 Tapering
 Psychedelic Intervention
 Professional and Medical Help
 Rehab
\`\`\`
There may be others, but regardless, there is no one-size-fits-all. The best solution
for you will depend largely upon your unique characteristics and situation. The one
thing you must not do, however, is nothing.

ADVICE FROM NIDA
The National Institute on Drug Abuse, part of the U.S. Department of Health, offers
a wealth of information on its website. The following was extracted from an
introductory Q&A. Note that this can be reproduced without permission (although as
a matter of courtesy I did ask).

\`\`\`
Why can't I stop using drugs on my own?
Repeated drug use changes the brain, including parts of the brain that enable you to
exert self-control. These and other changes can be seen clearly in brain imaging
studies of people with drug addictions.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
If I want help, where do I start?
Asking for help is the first important step. Visiting your doctor for a possible referral
to treatment is one way to do it. You can ask if he or she is comfortable discussing
drug abuse screening and treatment. If not, ask for a referral to another doctor. You
can also contact an addiction specialist. It takes a lot of courage to seek help for a
drug problem because there is a lot of hard work ahead. However, treatment can
work, and people recover from addiction every day. Like other chronic diseases,
addiction can be managed successfully. Treatment enables people to counteract
addiction's powerful, disruptive effects on brain and behavior and regain control of
their lives.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
Will they make me stop taking drugs immediately?
The first step in treatment is "detox," which helps patients to remove all of the drugs
from their system. This is important, because drugs impair the mental abilities you
need to stay in treatment. When patients first stop abusing drugs, they can
experience a variety of physical and emotional withdrawal symptoms, including
depression, anxiety, and other mood disorders; restlessness; and sleeplessness.
Treatment centers are very experienced in helping you get through this process and
keeping you safe. Depending on what drug you are addicted to, there may also be
medications that will make you feel a little better during drug withdrawal, which
makes it easier to stop using.
\`\`\`

[The WorldScape]

\`\`\`
What kind of counseling should I get?
Behavioral treatment (also known as "talk therapy") helps patients engage in the
treatment process, change their attitudes and behaviors related to drug abuse, and
increase healthy life skills. These treatments can also enhance the effectiveness of
medications and help people stay in treatment longer. Treatment for drug abuse and
addiction can be delivered in many different settings using a variety of behavioral
approaches.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
Will I need medication?
There are medications available to treat addictions to alcohol, nicotine, and opioids
(heroin and pain relievers). Other medications are available to treat possible mental
health conditions (such as depression) that may be contributing to your addiction. In
addition, nonaddictive medication is sometimes prescribed to help with drug
withdrawal. When medication is available, it can be combined with behavioral
therapy to ensure success for most patients. Your treatment provider will advise you
on what medications are available for your particular situation.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
I take drugs because I feel depressed—nothing else seems to work. If I stop, I'll feel
much worse—how do I deal with that?
It is very possible you need to find treatment for both depression and addiction. This
is very common. It’s called "comorbidity," "co-occurrence," or "dual diagnosis" when
you have more than one health problem at the same time. It is important that you
discuss all of your symptoms and behaviors with your doctor. There are many
nonaddictive drugs that can help with depression or other mental health issues.
Sometimes health care providers do not communicate with each other as well as they
should, so you can be your own best advocate and make sure all of your health
providers know about all of the health issues that concern you. People who have co-
occurring issues should be treated for all of them at the same time.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
How can I talk to others with similar problems?
Self-help groups can extend the effects of professional treatment. The most well-
known self-help groups are those affiliated with Alcoholics Anonymous (AA),
Narcotics Anonymous (NA), and Cocaine Anonymous (CA), all of which are based on
the 12-step model. Most drug addiction treatment programs encourage patients to
participate in a self-help group during and after formal treatment. These groups can
be particularly helpful during recovery, as they are a source of ongoing communal
support to stay drug free.
\`\`\`
The following bullet point list is also offered:

\`\`\`
 Drug addiction is a chronic disease characterized by drug seeking and use that is
compulsive, or difficult to control, despite harmful consequences.
 Brain changes that occur over time with drug use challenge an addicted person’s
self-control and interfere with their ability to resist intense urges to take drugs.
This is why drug addiction is also a relapsing disease.
 Relapse is the return to drug use after an attempt to stop. Relapse indicates the
need for more or different treatment.
 Most drugs affect the brain's reward circuit by flooding it with the chemical
messenger dopamine. This overstimulation of the reward circuit causes the
intensely pleasurable "high" that leads people to take a drug again and again.
\`\`\`

[The WorldScape]

\`\`\`
 Over time, the brain adjusts to the excess dopamine, which reduces the high that
the person feels compared to the high they felt when first taking the drug—an
effect known as tolerance. They might take more of the drug, trying to achieve the
same dopamine high.
 No single factor can predict whether a person will become addicted to drugs. A
combination of genetic, environmental, and developmental factors influences risk
for addiction. The more risk factors a person has, the greater the chance that
taking drugs can lead to addiction.
 Drug addiction is treatable and can be successfully managed.

problem-drugs-adults
\`\`\`
There are also a number of less conventional approaches available, which may, or
may not, be appropriate. It is suggested, therefore, that in addition to following the
advice offered above, direct Internet research is undertaken. This is unlikely to be
time or effort wasted.

Even if you are at the earliest stages of addiction, the sooner you take the first step to
recovery the better. Waiting, and putting it off, is a decision in itself, and it is the
wrong one. Help is available. Please step outside your current life narrative and seek
it.

ASIDE: CHEMICAL SEX & PORN ADDICTION
A number of chemicals accentuate sexual appetite and drive, some to a huge degree.
Given the substantial volume of internet posts which discuss never ending porn
binges and mammoth sex sessions, this is hardly a secret. Indeed, certain chemicals
are renowned for it.

However, putting sniggers and humour aside, this is fraught with issues, some of
which are serious. The scenario itself is increasingly common.

One aspect is that linking sexual pleasure to the use of a drug will inevitably increase
desire for that drug. The drug is thus likely to be consumed more regularly, leading to
the obvious risks, including chemical addiction.

Less obvious is perhaps the effect upon the individual’s sex life. Given the artificial
enhancement of the sexual experience, sex (or porn) without the drug is unlikely to
ever reach the same heights, or in some cases, anything like the same heights. This
can cause a lack of interest, and thus relative impotency under normal conditions,
with clear implications for relationships and general life. Lengthy porn binging can
also lead to feelings of guilt, lower self-esteem, and frequently, anxiety and
depression.

Again, this is an area in which, if in doubt, third party help and counselling should be
urgently sought.

[The WorldScape]

4.3.3 Alcoholism

The following two letters were obviously written largely through frustration.
However, perhaps they present arguments which may help someone somewhere.

DEAR HABITUAL ALCOHOL USER
The stats don’t lie and neither does the science. Equally, the toxic nature of alcohol is
not hidden. Yet, its presence pervades our lives almost by stealth.

What if you swapped the name alcohol for that of another similarly hard drug (see
Section 4.2 for a list)? What if you used this drug in exactly the same manner as you
use alcohol?

How does this sound to you? “I like a nice hit of heroin with my dinner.” “A bit of
meth after work helps me to unwind.” “I’m just popping out to the pub for some
crack cocaine with the boys.”

I suspect that you would never dream of binging on heroin at the weekend, or
snorting meth after work, or socializing in the pub over some crack. Why not?
Like alcohol, they all create euphoric pleasure, a high, and a come-down, which are
all variable with dose. They all have broadly similar profiles in terms of harm and
addiction.

What is the difference, therefore, other than that you have been conditioned and
engineered by society, by the mainstream media, and by morally challenged
politicians? There is no difference.

So why don’t you treat alcohol in the same way as other drugs, and analyse it on the
same metrics? Why don’t you measure disadvantages versus advantages, risk versus
benefit, addiction potential, and so forth? Why don’t you kick the cultural
programming, use your intelligence to frame your own opinion, and take rational
decisions based upon confirmed facts? Why is alcohol given a free pass?

Alcohol numbs your mind. It dumbs you down and inflates your ego. It blinds you to
bigger pictures and to the wider perspectives. Indeed, one of those pictures pertains
to alcohol itself and its real place in the drugscape.

Most of us have friends or family who are plagued by alcoholism. I certainly do. It is
agonizing to watch the slow destruction of someone you love. If they read these
words they couldn’t argue with them, but they are likely to be far too afflicted to act
upon them. You are hopefully not.

Think about the role that alcohol plays in your life, how a lifetime of habitual use will

DEAR ALCOHOLIC
By now you don’t need me, or anyone else, to tell you that alcohol is a hard drug. In
your moments of clarity you can see through the haze what it has done to you, to
your life, and to all those who care for you. You can see the trail of anguish and
destruction, which is so painful that you drink again to escape those thoughts.

That drink makes it feel better doesn’t it? The relief! It’s fleeting. All too quickly it
feels worse again, as the brutal reality catches you. You repeat the cycle. It will always
catch you.

You know where this is leading, but you can’t face it. Nor can you evade the nagging
feeling that you are not living a life at all. You are enduring a slow death.

You have tried to stop. You have tried really hard. You have gone cold turkey. You
have even used support medication, like diazepam, which gave some relief, for a
while, but not enough. Only alcohol really blunts the torment; the dread in the pit of
your stomach and the terrible unremitting pain that always seems to fill the void.

The same story is familiar across users of other drugs too; other hard drugs.
However, many people do beat them. People like you beat them. People like you beat
alcohol.

I’m not a counsellor, and I’m not a professional, but I have seen souls shattered and
lives lost. I can only offer my opinion, but it is one forged through pain and sorrow.

Try again to stop, but this time, take some truths with you on the journey.

When you stop, promise yourself that it will be for ever. You can’t just switch from
alcoholic to occasional social drinker. You have to make fundamental changes to your
perspective and consequently to your life.

You have to learn to see alcohol differently, and not see it as a source of pleasure.

For you, it is a source of misery. It is a brief euphoria which sinks agonizingly into
that fearful abyss. This is what it is, and what it will always be. Any other perspective
is an illusion. You know this already, so let it go. Let it go for good.

There is life without it. Time will help you to see that. But you must invest that time,
little by little, day by day. You must give time a chance.

Your head will eventually clear and you will slowly learn to find pleasure in the little
things again. You will learn and you will grow and you will redefine yourself, and
somewhere downstream you will find joy again; you will find life again.

With your new perspective you will also stop envying those around you, who are
drinking their drug, and see that they are also dulling their senses, damaging their
bodies, blunting their minds. You will eventually be able to look into their cloudy
world without the fog, and see beyond the initial lift of the intoxication, at the full
picture. You won’t want to go back.

[The WorldScape]

To get there, you will need support. You are well aware that there are a variety of
support groups, like Alcoholics Anonymous. Seek them out and approach them and
find the right one for yourself. Use them. Try to find people you can scream help to if
you think you might crack. Build bridges with real people. Connect.

Whatever family or friends you have left, ask them for help too. Tell them that you
are trying to get clean. Don’t hide it, or you will continue to be placed in difficult
positions. Be as open as you can be. Be honest.

See your GP or any medical practitioner you can possibly gain access to. If you have
the opportunity to get into rehab, grab it with both hands. Accept professional help.

Don’t ever use a setback in life or piece of bad luck as an excuse to revert. Your
addiction will always look for excuses. There are none. Use this as a mantra: I will do
it... there are no excuses to have a drink.... I am not drinking today.

Set yourself targets: 1 day; 2 days; this weekend; a week; 2 weeks; to the start of the
month; a month; 50 days; and so forth. Look forward to the next target and focus
upon it.

It’s a long slow path, but you can really make it through the tunnel, if you want to.
But you have to decide to do it, and to throw yourself 100% into it. You have to
choose life, and mean it.

Life! Right now your life is ebbing away in a drunken haze. You are losing it, day by
day.

Yet there is so much more.

If you can just force yourself to reach out and go for it, you can and will find
happiness again. It’s at the end of that tunnel, waiting for you.

Eventually the pain will stop, for you, and all those who matter to you. It will: I
absolutely 100% guarantee it.

So try again... choose life.... please.

OR ANOTHER ROUTE
Would a radical change of circumstance or an entirely different life help you? Would
taking yourself away from all your existing issues, or throwing yourself into some
sort of project, help? What about a radical or alternative approach to changing or
widening your perspective? These are all methods of helping you to fundamentally
change your outlook, and they do work for many people.

Try to think clearly about how to proceed from here. Above all, take the first step,
and take it urgently.

A TOXIC, HARD, ADDICTIVE DRUG
Even with intensive family support, the speed at which a chronic alcoholic can

4.3.4 Overdose & Emergency Response

The signs and symptoms of an overdose will vary according to the drug or drugs in
question. However, the general rule is to err on the side of caution. In other words, if
in doubt, don’t delay: call for urgent medical help.

In considering the information below, note that an overdose will not produce all of
the symptoms in the lists provided. A single symptom may be sufficient to indicate
that immediate action is required.

\`\`\`
DEPRESSANT OVERDOSE SYMPTOMS
CNS depressants include both benzodiazepines and opioids. Symptoms of
overdose may include:
 shallow breathing
 snoring and/or gurgling (due to partly blocked airways)
 unconsciousness or difficult to awaken
 unresponsiveness to physical stimulation
 blue fingertips or lips
 drowsiness
 disorientation or impaired co-ordination
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
Note that in the case of opioids, nausea and vomiting may occur, and pinpoint
pupils may also be present (especially if other drugs are not involved).
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
Overdose of depressants can lead to respiratory failure, coma, brain damage
and death.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
ACTION: Call the emergency services immediately and ask for an ambulance.
Monitor the patient, stay calm, and keep airways clear.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
ALCOHOL POISONING SYMPTOMS
As alcohol is a CNS depressant the list above is applicable. In addition,
however, the following symptoms may occur:
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
 vomiting whilst asleep
 lost coordination
 seizures or spasms
 blue-tinged or pale skin
 low body temperature
 conscious but unresponsive (stupor)
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
Acute alcohol poising can lead to choking, respiratory failure, cardiac arrest,
coma, brain damage and death.
\`\`\`

[The WorldScape]

\`\`\`
ACTION: Call the emergency services immediately and ask for an ambulance.
The following advice, which is offered via the NHS website, may help you to
manage the situation until its arrival:
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
 try to keep the patient awake and sitting up
 provide water (assuming the patient is able to drink)
 keep the patient warm
 stay with the patient and remain calm
 if the patient is unconscious, put him/her in recovery position
(on their side), keeping airways clear, and monitor breathing
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
The following is a commonly produced list of what you must not do. DO NOT:
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
 leave the patient to sleep it off
 make the patient vomit
 put the patient under a cold shower
 allow the patient to drink more alcohol
 give the patient coffee
 walk the patient around
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
Stay calm, and in so much as you are able, try to remain in control of the
situation.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
STIMULANT OVERDOSE SYMPTOMS
The symptoms of stimulant overdose may include:
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
 chest pains
 severe headache
 seizures or convulsions
 unconsciousness
 breathing difficulties
 rapid heart rate
 disorientation / confusion
 high temperature and overheating without sweating
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
Stimulant overdose can lead to heart attacks, seizures, strokes and psychosis.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
ACTION: Call the emergency services. The following are commonly suggested
to be applicable until arrival of professional assistance:
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
 monitor temperature and keep the patient cool enough to
prevent overheating
 provide sufficient water to prevent dehydration
 stay calm and try to calm the patient
\`\`\`

[The WorldScape]

\`\`\`
GENERAL OVERDOSE SYMPTOMS
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
For drugs not categorised as earlier, and in the absence of specific knowledge
or expertise, the general principles apply. If in any doubt, call the emergency
services. Until arrival of help, monitor the patient, exercise common sense,
and remain calm.
\`\`\`
CALLING FOR HELP
In all cases obtain as much information as you can to aid the emergency services. The
following may be helpful to them, if known:

\`\`\`
 the age, weight and height of the patient.
 the identity of the drug or drugs used
 how much was taken
 whether any prescription medicines are being used
\`\`\`
Don’t neglect the patient whilst obtaining this data, and do not delay the phone call,
as these are both of primary importance.

Listen carefully to what the emergency service operator tells you. Ask for and take
any advice offered regarding what to do whilst the ambulance arrives. This may
include instruction to administer first aid or CPR.

If there is any of the overdosed drug left, keep it and hand it to the emergency
services. Don’t let fear of police prosecution prevent you from acting.

\`\`\`
Do not hesitate to call the emergency services
\`\`\`
Footnote: In the unlikely event that the practices outlined in the first part of this
book (ref #9) have been followed, information relating to the drugs/drugs in
question and emergency service contact details may be available courtesy of a note
held by the patient.

4.4 THE LAWSCAPE

The last thing I needed whilst researching for this book was a knock on the door, and
the police barging in to take me away for the crime of experimenting with my own
mind. This is the last thing anyone needs.

That a third party dictates what I can and cannot put into my own body (which I
own), and determines how I can and cannot explore my own consciousness (which I
own), surely raises the must fundamental questions regarding human rights.

However, despite this principled position, it would be hugely irresponsible to ask for
trouble by openly breaking the law, or at least, by not taking all necessary steps to
reduce the prospect of such difficulty.

The following segments provide some basic information.

4.4.1 The United Kingdom

The main statutes regulating the availability, possession and supply of drugs in the
UK are the Misuse of Drugs Act, the Medicines Act, and the Psychoactive Substances
Act. The latter of these, commonly abbreviated to PSA, is by far the most invasive.
Indeed, it completely usurped British legal tradition, which for centuries operated on
the basis that citizens could do anything as long as it wasn’t illegal. This was replaced
by a statute (the PSA) which decreed that everything was illegal unless specifically
exempted. The UK media cheered from the sidelines.

THE PSYCOACTIVE SUBSTANCES ACT 2016
This hugely intrusive law came into force on 26th May 2016. Quoting the
government’s own web site, it made it an offence to:

\`\`\`
“produce, supply, offer to supply, possess with intent to supply, possess on
custodial premises, import or export psychoactive substances; that is, any
substance intended for human consumption that is capable of producing a
psychoactive effect.”
\`\`\`
This unprecedented overreach applies even to psychoactive substances that have not
been invented or discovered yet.

Note that possession itself, unless on custodial premises, is not covered. This means
that all substances previously legal to possess, including legal highs, remained legal
to possess, unless intended for supply to a third party. Note also that, regarding
procurement, it became an offence to import, embracing Internet purchases as well
as more traditional routes.

It is worth re-emphasizing that the PSA did not replace or repeal previous legislation.
Drugs which were specifically covered by the Misuse of Drugs Act, prior to 26th May
2016, remained illegal to both possess and supply.

[The WorldScape]

THE MISUSE OF DRUGS ACT 1971
Of the other two statutes, the Misuse of Drugs Act is the most relevant and most
frequently exercised.

Quoting homeoffice.gov.uk, offences defined by this include:

\`\`\`
“possession of a controlled drug unlawfully, possession of a controlled drug
with intent to supply it, supplying or offering to supply a controlled drug
(even where no charge is made for the drug) and allowing premises you
occupy or manage to be used unlawfully for the purpose of producing or
supplying controlled drugs”.
\`\`\`
The number of drugs controlled (those made illegal) under this legislation has grown
significantly year on year. They are individually categorized under three distinct
classes, A, B and C, each of which carries a different range of sanctions.

\`\`\`
DRUG CLASS POSSESSION SUPPLY
Class A Up to 7 years + fine Up to life + fine
Class B Up to 5 years + fine Up to 14 years + fine
Class C Up to 2 years + fine Up to 14 years + fine
\`\`\`
Regarding which drug has been placed into which class, the specifics are listed on the
following pages of the legislation.gov.uk website:

\`\`\`
Class A Drugs:
http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1971/38/schedule/2/part/I
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
Class B Drugs:
http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1971/38/schedule/2/part/II
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
Class C Drugs:
http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1971/38/schedule/2/part/III
\`\`\`
An alphabetically based list, drug by drug, is provided on the following web page:

\`\`\`
http://www.gov.uk/government/publications/controlled-drugs-list--2/list-of-most-commonly-
encountered-drugs-currently-controlled-under-the-misuse-of-drugs-legislation
\`\`\`
Note that the disclaimers quoted below apply to all these lists (and to others cited
elsewhere on the same websites):

\`\`\`
“The following is a list of the most commonly encountered drugs currently
controlled under the misuse of drugs legislation”.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
“Although it is extensive, the list is not exhaustive and, in the event of a
substance not being listed below, reference should also be made to the
published Act and Regulations at legislation.gov.uk”.
\`\`\`

[The WorldScape]

THE POTENTIAL CONSEQUENCES
If you are contemplating the use of illegal drugs, in other words, if you are thinking of
breaking the law, your calculation should include consideration of the potential
sentence, should you be arrested, charged and convicted.

Clearly, this will vary, as it is at least partly dependent upon your individual
circumstances, and the attitude and disposition of the particular judge or
magistrate(s). However, in England and Wales the Sentencing Council issues
guidelines for the sentencing of offenders aged 18 and older.

Further to this, the Coroners and Justice Act states that:

\`\`\`
“Every court –
(a) must, in sentencing an offender, follow any sentencing guideline
which is relevant to the offender’s case, and
(b) must, in exercising any other function relating to the sentencing of
offenders, follow any sentencing guidelines which are relevant to the
exercise of the function,
unless the court is satisfied that it would be contrary to the interests of justice
to do so.”
\`\`\`
Whilst these are guidelines, they do provide broad parameters which can give an
indication of the likely consequences of your own course of action, should this
scenario unfold.

They cover factors such as aggravating and mitigating circumstances, category of
harm (e.g. quantity of the drug in question), and the nature of your specific role.

As this is a publication, it is subject to change. The current version can be
downloaded or viewed in its entirety from the following web page:

\`\`\`
http://www.sentencingcouncil.org.uk/publications/item/drug-offences-definitive-guideline/
\`\`\`
It is strongly recommended that you read this document carefully, prior to subjecting
yourself to the possibility of its provisions.

IF THE WORST HAPPENS
If you fall foul of the law in any way, the following basic information may be of use.
Note, however, that this does not constitute legal advice, which should be sought
from a qualified practitioner.

\`\`\`
THE POLICE
If you are stopped on the street by a plain clothed officer, you should insist on
seeing his or her warrant card. If the reason has not been volunteered, you
should ask why you have been stopped.
\`\`\`

[The WorldScape]

\`\`\`
If you are searched, you should ask for a record of the search. Do not resist,
even if the search is unlawful (address this later). Stay as calm as possible
throughout.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
If the police come to your home, again stay calm, and ask how you can help. If
they wish to search your premises, note that they can do so, without a warrant,
if they arrest you, or in any of a pre-defined set of circumstances. The latter
are described by Citizens Advice as follows:
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
Situations in which the police can enter premises without a warrant
include when they want to:
 deal with a breach of the peace or prevent it
 enforce an arrest warrant
 arrest a person in connection with certain offences
 recapture someone who has escaped from custody
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
IF YOU ARE ARRESTED
You have heard it a thousand times on television, but here is the caution
which should accompany any arrest relating to drugs:
"You do not have to say anything. But it may harm your defence if you
do not mention when questioned something which you later rely on in
court. Anything you do say may be given in evidence."
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
This more or less means what it states. If the first time you mention your
defence is actually in court, the magistrate or judge may well consider that you
have invented the defence in the interim (and the judge may advise the jury
accordingly).
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
At the same time, however, it does not mean that you are compelled to say
anything which may incriminate yourself. You are not. Indeed, the sensible
course is to consult a solicitor in private prior to discussing the case with the
police.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
In the early stages it can be of the utmost importance that you think very
carefully before you speak, even if you are frightened or under the influence of
alcohol or drugs. Try not to panic, and try to establish, and mentally note,
whatever information you can (e.g. the specific reason you have been
arrested).
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
Importantly, you should exercise your right to see a solicitor. This is free of
charge. Your solicitor should be present when you are questioned or
interviewed. Again, this is something you should insist on.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
You also have the right to have a person of your choice notified of your arrest.
Note that this is not the same as having the right to make a phone call yourself
(as in the United States and depicted in countless American movies).
\`\`\`

[The WorldScape]

\`\`\`
If you are alone in a cell try to stay as calm as possible. You have not been
forgotten and cannot be held indefinitely. Note that you do have the right to
speak to the custody officer, who is responsible for your welfare.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
FROM THE GOVERNMENT
The following is taken directly from Gov.uk, and describes your rights if you
are taken into police custody:
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
The custody officer at the police station must explain your rights. You
have the right to:
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
 get free legal advice
 tell someone where you are
 have medical help if you’re feeling ill
 see the rules the police must follow (‘Codes of Practice’)
 see a written notice telling you about your rights, eg regular
breaks for food and to use the toilet (you can ask for a notice in
your language) or an interpreter to explain the notice
 You’ll be searched and your possessions will be kept by the police
custody officer while you’re in the cell.

4.4.2 The United States

At a federal level, the primary drug-relevant statute is the Controlled Substances Act
(CSA). This defines five Schedules (classifications), with various specifications
regarding which drug is included in each. This is largely overseen by the Drug
Enforcement Administration (DEA) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

The DEA presents these schedules as follows (current as of 2017):

\`\`\`
SCHEDULE I
Schedule I drugs, substances, or chemicals are defined as drugs with no
currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse. Some examples
of Schedule I drugs are:
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
Heroin, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), marijuana (cannabis), 3,4-
methylenedioxymethamphetamine (ecstasy), methaqualone, and
peyote
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
SCHEDULE II
Schedule II drugs, substances, or chemicals are defined as drugs with a high
potential for abuse, with use potentially leading to severe psychological or
physical dependence. These drugs are also considered dangerous. Some
examples of Schedule II drugs are:
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
Combination products with less than 15 milligrams of hydrocodone per
dosage unit (Vicodin), cocaine, methamphetamine, methadone,
hydromorphone (Dilaudid), meperidine (Demerol), oxycodone
(OxyContin), fentanyl, Dexedrine, Adderall, and Ritalin
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
SCHEDULE III
Schedule III drugs, substances, or chemicals are defined as drugs with a
moderate to low potential for physical and psychological dependence.
Schedule III drugs abuse potential is less than Schedule I and Schedule II
drugs but more than Schedule IV. Some examples of Schedule III drugs are:
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
Products containing less than 90 milligrams of codeine per
dosage unit (Tylenol with codeine), ketamine, anabolic steroids,
testosterone
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
SCHEDULE IV
Schedule IV drugs, substances, or chemicals are defined as drugs with a low
potential for abuse and low risk of dependence. Some examples of Schedule IV
drugs are:
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
Xanax, Soma, Darvon, Darvocet, Valium, Ativan, Talwin, Ambien,
Tramadol
\`\`\`

[The WorldScape]

\`\`\`
SCHEDULE V
Schedule V drugs, substances, or chemicals are defined as drugs with lower
potential for abuse than Schedule IV and consist of preparations containing
limited quantities of certain narcotics. Schedule V drugs are generally used for
antidiarrheal, antitussive, and analgesic purposes. Some examples of Schedule
V drugs are:
Cough preparations with less than 200 milligrams of codeine or per
100 milliliters (Robitussin AC), Lomotil, Motofen, Lyrica, Parepectolin
http://www.dea.gov/druginfo/ds.shtml
\`\`\`
Clearly, on the basis of relative harm these classifications are in themselves
ridiculous, but they form the framework for a punitive system which is widely
considered to be vindictive and draconian.

As ludicrous as this may appear to most Europeans, US law even creates a penal
regime for the possession and distribution of items such as bongs, pipes and rolling
papers, which are collectively referred to as paraphernalia.

\`\`\`
Even the most basic of items are defined as drug paraphernalia
\`\`\`
Layered on top of all this is another disturbing aspect known as mandatory
minimum sentencing. Mandatory minimum sentencing laws dictate minimum
sentences for certain offences, which are imposed regardless of individual or
extenuating circumstances. Many of these offences carry prison terms of years, and
sometimes, decades.

The picture in the United States is further complicated by the partial judicial
autonomy of the individual states. This creates enormous geographic variation in
terms of sentencing. Findlaw.Com cites the following example to demonstrate this
tendency:

\`\`\`
“For example, Kentucky, which has adopted similar mandatory minimum
sentencing guidelines, has some of the toughest provisions. For simple
possession, first offenders get 2 to 10 years in prison and a fine of up to
\$20,000. In contrast, California has some of the lightest drug possession
sentences: between \$30 and \$500 in fines and/or 15 to 180 days in jail”
\`\`\`
In theory, where state and federal laws disagree the supremacy clause applies (which
is part of Article VI of the Constitution) and federal law is supposed to prevail. This
currently creates a somewhat discretionary standoff in terms of a number of drug
related situations, not least with respect to cannabis legalisation. It remains to be
seen how this will eventually unfold.

[The WorldScape]

MASS INCARCERATION
Unfortunately, most US citizens continue to be subject to a judicial regime which is
firmly embedded within the demonstrable excesses and cruelty of a culture
perpetrated by the war on drugs. Mass incarceration and patently excessive
sentencing of non-violent drug offenders continues unabated.

On this occasion, statistics do not lie. For example, with just 5% of the world’s
population, the United States accounts for approximately 25% of the global prison
population.

The numbers themselves are equally stark. In 2014 there were more than 1.5 million
drugs arrests, of which more than 80% were for possession only. Headline
statements like these are just the tip of a very insidious and inhumane iceberg.

It therefore almost goes without saying that if you are a US resident you should take
all sensible measures to reduce the prospects of becoming a victim of this madness.

IF THE WORST HAPPENS
If you do fall foul of the law, and are confronted by the police or arrested, the
following guidance is commonly cited on the Internet, and may be of use. Note,
however, that this does not constitute legal advice, which should be sought
independently.

1. First and foremost, try to relax and stay calm. Give yourself the best
opportunity to think clearly by avoiding panic or excessive stress.

\`\`\`
The following statement will typically be issued on arrest:
“You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law. You have the right to an attorney.
If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be provided for you. Do you
understand the rights I have just read to you? With these rights in
mind, do you wish to speak to me?”
\`\`\`
2. Know your rights. These include:
    - The 5th Amendment right to remain silent. Note that it is almost always
       in your best interests to do so, particularly as anything you say may be
       subsequently used against you. A common method of dealing with this
       is to request a lawyer in response to every question. Do exercise this
       right.
    - You have the right to have a lawyer present while you are questioned.
       One will be appointed for you if you cannot afford one.

\`\`\`
Note that if you are not informed of these facts your lawyer can ask that any
statements you made are not used in court (this is known as your Miranda
right).
\`\`\`

[The WorldScape]

3. Call a lawyer as soon as you are able. If you don’t have or know one, call
family or a friend and ask them to find one for you as soon as possible. Bear in
mind that your call could be eavesdropped, so be careful what you say.

\`\`\`
If you cannot find a lawyer and have to wait for one to be appointed, either
prior to a court appearance or by a judge, do not forget your right to remain
silent in the interim.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
Discussion between you and your lawyer is confidential. When you have
consulted your lawyer, consider the advice and information given, and try to
make the most rational and sensible decisions on how to proceed.
\`\`\`
4. Respectfully deny consent to a search of your home, as per the Fourth
Amendment. A search is only lawful if you have consented, or the police
officer has a warrant, or has a valid reason (reasonable suspicion / probable
cause, which usually but not always relates to a vehicle search).

\`\`\`
Having stated this, the police do have the right to:
\`\`\`
- Search your belongings, body and clothing (which again requires
    reasonable suspicion)
- Search your vehicle if you are in it (subject to probable cause, based
    upon what the police officer sees through the window, your conduct
    and/or answers to questions)
- Fingerprint you
- Ask you to undertake a test (such as walking in a straight line), or ask
    for a sample of your breath, blood, etc.
5. If the police have abused you or have committed any infraction, seek to
collect names and addresses of any witnesses when you are able, and gather
any other information that may assist.

\`\`\`
Do not react or respond to misconduct, or provoke retaliation. It is far better
to address these matters subsequently, via a lawsuit.
\`\`\`
Finally, police confrontation or arrest can occur at any time, so it is advised that you
learn as much as possible in terms of your rights and the legal issues relevant to your
location and your situation. Ideally, also identify a legal firm or multiple legal firms
to use should you need them.

This isn’t the most exciting pursuit in the world, but it may be one of the most
important, should the worst happen.

WHEN A PICTURE PAINTS A THOUSAND WORDS
The impact of the war on drugs on incarceration in the United States:

The effects of mass incarceration and the war on drugs on public health:

[Source: NVSS, CDC.gov]

The wholesale destruction of lives and families could hardly be clearer.

[The WorldScape]

LEST WE FORGET
Those incarcerated are real people, having had their real lives destroyed by
manifestly unjust laws and a morally bankrupt pursuit. To illustrate the human cost
of this unremitting and ongoing tragedy, this segment puts some names to the stats.

When I began to consider this issue, two relatively high profile victims immediately
sprung to my mind:

\`\`\`
Ross Ulbricht (Double Life Sentence Plus Forty Years)
Lindsay Sandiford (Death, Awaiting Execution in Bali)
\`\`\`
I recall being absolutely appalled when I first read about these two cases.

More recently, whilst searching the Internet for more I quickly found the following
cannabis related victims, courtesy of Rolling Stone magazine:

\`\`\`
Fate Vincent Winslow (Life Without Parole)
Michael Alonzo Thompson (40 to 60 Years)
Crystal Munoz (18 Years)
Andy Cox (Life Without Parole)
\`\`\`
Then I encountered CAN-DO, a non-profit foundation that advocates Clemency for
All Non-violent Drug Offenders (www.CanDoClemency.com). This group educates,
campaigns and supports, and literally does put names to faces. I picked a few more
from this website, at random.

\`\`\`
John Bolen (Life Without Parole)
Evelyn Bozon Pappa (Life Without Parole)
Charles “Duke” Tanner (30 Years)
Eva Palma Atencio (Life Without Parole)
Michael Bryant (Life)
John Knock (Life Without Parole)
\`\`\`
There are just so many.

Think of these people next week, next month, next year: whatever you are doing,
these victims and their families will still be suffering. More will have joined them.

If you are able, it may help to write, so that they know that someone is at least
thinking about them. If you can find time, join others and campaign to change laws
and to free the broken and incarcerated, wherever they may be.

A reminder of the enormous scale of this cruelty (from DrugPolicy.org):

\`\`\`
“Amount spent annually in the U.S. on the war on drugs: \$58+ billion
Number of arrests in 2017 in the U.S. for drug law violations: 1,632,921
Number of drug arrests that were for possession only: 1,394,514 (85.4
percent)”
\`\`\`

[The WorldScape]

4.4.3 The Rest Of The World

Wherever you live, whatever the location, if you engage with drugs, in any capacity, it
is essential that you undertake at least some elementary research, along the lines
documented earlier for the United Kingdom and the United States.

It is in your own interests to:

\`\`\`
 Know your local laws
 Know your rights
\`\`\`
These vary considerably from nation to nation, as the war on drugs is interpreted
and applied to differing extremes, and accordingly, human rights are abused to
varying degrees. In many cases, the law represents a greater threat to your well
being, and that of your family, than the drug itself.

This issue should never be dismissed as something that will never happen to you. It
can happen to anyone; even to the innocent.

TOURISM & TRAVELLING
If you travel, and intend to engage en route or at a foreign destination, you need to be
just as aware of the local situation as residents. In some locations you should be even
more aware, as racism and prejudice may also play a detrimental role.

Unless you are fully informed of local laws, customs and practices, you may well be
taking serious risks of which you are unaware. Do the research well in advance, and
base your decisions upon sound factual information.

If you are unable to do this, or if in any doubt, it is strongly suggested that you
refrain.

\`\`\`
Wherever you sample or possess a psychoactive drug,
know the local law and know your rights
\`\`\`

ON MY TRAVELS
These are two of the most notorious prisons in South East Asia. I visited inmates in
them some years ago, whilst pursuing various humanitarian projects.

\`\`\`
THE BANGKOK HILTON, THAILAND
I took this photograph in the remand section of Klongprem Central Prison.
Behind the glass are the prisoner visitation rooms.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
HOTEL K, INDONESIA
The visitor area in Kerobokan Prison in Bali was an open-air space, largely
exposed to the blazing sun, with seating being the ground itself. I was unable
to take an interior shot due to confiscation of phones and cameras on entry.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
How many non-violent drug offenders are incarcerated in these and countless
places like them? Take special care not to become one on your own travels.
\`\`\`

[The WorldScape]

Unfortunately, it gets even worse:

\`\`\`
EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR KILLERS, SRI LANKA
In January 2019, President Sirisena of Sri Lanka cited President Duterte’s
murderous campaign in the Philippines (official death toll at time of writing
over 5,000), as “an example to the world.” A month later he informed the Sri
Lankan parliament of his intention to authorise hanging for drug offenders.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
A practical issue with respect to this was the need to find willing employees to
perform the gruesome task itself. Incredibly, these positions were duly
advertised in the Sri Lankan media. I took the following photograph outside
the Daily News building in Kandy, February 2019.

4.4.4 Dealers: A Different Perspective

Six degrees of separation embraces the proposition that everyone is connected to
everyone else on earth in six or fewer steps, via a chain of ‘a friend of a friend’. Here
is a genuine question: how many steps are you away from someone who sells drugs?

Whoever you are, I believe that it is probably one or two, and an absolute maximum
of three.

In stating this I am not referring to online purchases or the dark net markets, which
provide drugs to many. I refer to typical face to face transactions.

If you read the earlier section detailing how many people use drugs, the sheer
number, 250 million, provides a clue as to how many drug sellers there must be in
the world.

The obvious implication is that the vast majority are regular members of the public,
who pass small quantities to their friends: a few pills, some weed, a gram of cocaine,
etc. They tend to be fairly ordinary people in the main, who simply use and share
social and psychoactive materials with those they are close to or have a relationship
with. Indeed, as suggested above, you will almost certainly have friends who either
sell or share themselves, or who know someone who does.

As far as I am aware, I don’t actually know a drug seller personally, which probably
under-qualifies me to write this section. However, I am pretty sure that I know a few
people who do know a drug seller. Remarkably, they are neither violent thugs nor
gangsters. This will also apply to the sellers they know.

The fundamental truth of the situation is that most drug vendors will form a cross
section of the population. There will be good people, bad people, and everything in
between.

THE SCUM OF THE EARTH
The media perspective, however, as pushed relentlessly on to the public, is that
anyone selling a drug is the scum of the earth (unless it is a state-sanctioned drug
such as alcohol and tobacco), and that they are even lower than you are as a drug
user. This propagandistic and truth distorting construct of blame serves a variety of
the usual interests, but as misrepresentations usually do, it comes at a high cost.

When labels such as drug pusher and drug smuggler are routinely attached to the
suffering of addicts, for example, they take a life of their own, and become terms of
abuse and gross stigmatisation.

People feed upon them, and tend to create pictures of those accused of vending or
transporting which bear little resemblance to reality. Rationality and logic invariably
cease to apply.

[The WorldScape]

With respect to this, two international drug cases spring to mind, both of which
pertain to Australia. They demonstrate what can happen when society allows
propaganda and generic character assassination to consume reality and truth.

\`\`\`
EXAMPLE 1 – SCHAPELLE CORBY
Schapelle Corby was convicted of smuggling 4.2kg of cannabis into Indonesia
in 2005. She subsequently languished in a third world prison for almost 10
years, despite evidence which conclusively proved her innocence having been
published on the Internet years before she was finally released on parole.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
This was a politically charged high profile case, shaped by self-interest
expediency relating to the hugely contentious privatisation of Sydney airport
to political donors Macquarie Bank, and to the long term involvement of the
Australian Federal Police (AFP) in criminal and political activities. The spectre
of foreign policy appeasement also played a role, as fact based reporting was
replaced by tabloid trivia, gross misrepresentation and outright fiction.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
Off-the-record ministerial briefings set the ball rolling, and the juggernaut of
gutter journalism did the rest, renaming her “convicted drug smuggler
Schapelle Corby” via every reference. Schapelle Corby was ruthlessly smeared
and openly vilified at every turn, and she still is, as I write this page.
Contextually, the usual script with respect to drug cases was followed to the
letter, regardless of how many lies had to be peddled, or how much suffering
she and her family had to endure.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
Not all Australians bought into the deceit and slander
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
Once the picture had been painted, the facts of her case became irrelevant.
The flagrant abuses in Indonesia were long forgotten, and stereotypical
characters replaced the real flesh and blood left behind. Presenting newly
acquired evidence became impossible, as independent researchers were
simply derided as conspiracy theorists, and subsequently ignored. The die had
been cast and her status as a human being had been revoked.
\`\`\`

[The WorldScape]

\`\`\`
I was told on my visit that this particular courtroom was chosen for Schapelle Corby’s
trial so that the windows along the sides could be rented (for suitable bribes) to
Australian media crews. Her civil, legal and human rights were in fact breached
throughout the entire process (with material evidence of her innocence also being
withheld by Australian government ministers).
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
Having produced countless lies and smears about her over the years, the Australian
media were there to further torment her on her release, again putting her safety at
risk. Subsequent to this she was forced to stay in Indonesia on parole for three
further years, and gagged under threat of re-imprisonment should she tell her story.
During this period, she was stalked and harassed at every turn by the same media,
whilst the fiction and fabrications continued unabated.
\`\`\`

[The WorldScape]

\`\`\`
EXAMPLE 2 – ANDREW CHAN & MYURAN SUKUMARAN
The second case relates to Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, who, again
in Indonesia, were convicted of smuggling heroin in 2006. The two Australian
citizens, who admitted their guilt, were sentenced to death, and were
eventually executed under the most barbaric of circumstances on 29th April
2015.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
Whilst in prison, the two men had totally reformed, had re-invented
themselves, and via a range of programs, had helped to transform the lives of
countless other prisoners. The governor of Kerobokan Prison described them
as model prisoners, as their work had become widely known, and they had
touched so many lives.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
Despite this, they were brutally murdered to make a political point. They were
tied to a post and shot dead, whilst singing Amazing Grace to give strength to
others who were slaughtered alongside them.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
Another feature of this case was that the Australian Federal Police (yes, again)
had wilfully tipped off the Indonesians, with full knowledge of the likely
consequences. They could very easily have made the arrests as the men
returned to Australia, but instead, acted as judge, jurors, and executioners,
and have never been called to account for this.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
During the controversy surrounding the executions, members of the public
campaigned to save their lives, with thousands of posts and messages
appearing across social media. The following, posted by a former WA heroin
dealer, presents the position of vendors in terms which are almost entirely
absent from mainstream coverage:
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
Anon
February 14
I feel compelled to write my opinion on heroin and people that use it, this opinion is
based on 45yrs in the drug scene culture. I admit to being a high school dropout so
excuse the grammar I've been tossing around in my mind whether to bother as it is a
huge task for me, as I type slowly with one finger. I don't know if it will be read but I
thought if I don't make the effort to try and gather more support for Andrew and
Myuran from the Bali 9 as it would haunt me for the rest of my life. So hear goes.
Yesterday I was on another site debating the boys plight, I posted a comment on my
thoughts after reading a post I didn't agree with as it was saying they should be shot,
the guy came back with a reply, "I know where your coming from", but that he was an
ex junkie and he had suffered so much. For a few seconds I thought okay, then a crack
started to appear in my mind, and as more comments came up agreeing with him, he
got bolder, spewing up more of his boo hoo poor me stuff, then joined by more
agreement with him. Then another guy says yeah all drug dealers and paedophiles
should be shot. Now this really pissed me off, to compare a drug dealer who actually
doesn't force anyone to do anything, and the thing that does, its an insult to the child
victim of the assault.
So in the heroin world you have recreational users, you have junkies and then you
have snivelling junkie, they are all complicit. They enter an agreement with the dealer,
I want it, you get it for me and I'll pay you big money, now everyone knows this is a
criminal agreement. Human nature being what it is, very greedy, there's always
\`\`\`

[The WorldScape]

\`\`\`
someone willing to fill the need of the user to various degrees (and its like who came
first the user or the dealer, the chicken or the egg). So in the criminal world there's
supposed to be a code of conduct "death before dishonour", honour among thieves". If
you break this code there's names for you like rat, scum, give up, dog.
So now we have the snivelling junkie, who is solely responsible for the demonization
of heroin, who entered the agreement with the dealer, now wanting out. The reason
could be he may have grown up, had enough of the lifestyle, got caught, whatever,now
turning on his accomplice in the agreement made. He hasn't gone to the police, but
worse he's running around telling anyone that will listen his poor me stories. He's a
sniveller through and through, always someone else's fault, can't take responsibility
for his own actions. He goes to court, the snivelling junkie will blame the drugs for
whatever he's done, knowing he'll get a lighter sentence, you even have instances of
snivelling junkies who have never used heroin saying they have to get the lower
sentence.
So all this bullshit has demonized heroin more than it should be in the public eye, and
in the eyes of family and supporters of the snivelling junkie, and its the dealer that
suffers the consequence of these lies. This is what's happened to Andrew and Myuran,
sure they were stupid and naive to do what they did, but there's no way they are
ringleaders, they're only one link in the chain of dealers (probably the lowest) which
can include lawyers, doctor's, police, and every other walk of life, it's human greed, it's
everywhere. But if you think they deserve to die you have to include every other link
in the chain, and I'm sure that most people would have family and friends in the
chain.
Let’s have a closer look at heroin, it was in most cough mixtures up till the fifties. We
know it's made from opium, which has been around for hundreds of years, war's have
been waged over it, people from all over the world have wanted it for there own
various reasons. It's used by the thousands of kilo's in the medical field, as well as its
synthetic derivative pethidine as a painkiller.
There's a public belief that one hit of heroin and your hooked, this is not true, you
would have to use it dozens of times continuously. I also believe with a big number of
overdoses the user has a death wish, sad but true, other wise there would be millions
more. People use heroin for various lengths of time and stop, when users are jailed
most have no choice but to stop (no methadone), they go through a few day's of
discomfort. There are millions of people world wide using heroin with no problems
(except to the hip pocket), maybe family members, friends, workmates, from all walks
of life, and unless they tell you or they get caught you wouldn't know.
I would have thought all the users out there would be using this opportunity to
express your desire for heroin to be freely available. If this was so it would stop users
that have to commit crimes or sell there bodies to fund their use, it could be smoked,
or swallowed, which would result in zero overdoses, its mostly only injected because
of the price.
So what I'm saying is if your one of the people baying for these boy's blood, I'm
hoping what I've written might soften your heart, and we can bring these boy's and
the rest of the Australians rotting in some Asian prison home alive, where they
belong. They've done the time they would have received in Australia. Don't be swayed
by the snivelling junkie, who if they had any decency in them should be shouting the
loudest to bring them home, your the ones that created the temptation, now's the time
to redeem yourselves.
I'll leave it there for now, and apologize to anyone who has lost a loved one , if I have
seemed insensitive, I haven't wanted to, I just want these boy's home alive, I'm still
grieving Barlow and Chambers, and Tuong Van Nguyen. I hope I have achieved a
change of heart in someone, if you think what I have written could help these boy's
please share.
Thank you for listening.

\`\`\`
When the crunch came, and the preparations for the executions commenced,
Australian Prime Minster, Tony Abbott, opened with “What I'm not going to
do, though, is jeopardise the relationship with Indonesia.” The green light
could not have been more obvious. Indeed, on 16th January 2015, the ABC
cited the Indonesian Attorney-General: "Mr Prasetyo said the Australian
Government had not pressured Indonesia to grant clemency"
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
From the very start the media position was patently clear, with Rupert
Murdoch’s stable predictably setting the tone in February 2006:
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
In the run up to the executions, similar sentiments were all too common.
Indeed, the state’s own broadcaster, the ABC, commissioned a text poll in
which 52% of the respondents supported the deaths of the two men. This was
quickly picked up by the Indonesian government and used as justification.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
And so it continued:
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
With such signals coming out of Australia, it is little wonder that the Widodo
regime was emboldened enough to fulfil its brutal intentions.
\`\`\`

[The WorldScape]

These two examples illustrate a common feature of so many drug related cases. The
interests of those caught up in them are automatically of secondary importance to
those of every other party, including the police and the politicians.

Even worse, the human rights of those accused of selling drugs are often revoked,
usually with media and political support. Regardless of the specific circumstances of
any individual case, civilised norms tend to go out of the window, and a well
rehearsed farce of media fuelled public indignation routinely ensues. Reality is
frequently suspended.

The public are culturally conditioned to have absolutely no concern or compassion
for anyone who has been damned with those fateful terms: drug dealer, drug
smuggler or drug pusher.

EVERYDAY STIGMATISATION
Whilst these may be high profile cases, there are countless examples at the other end
of the scale. I recall one recent case involving contaminated ecstasy pills at a summer
music festival, with a couple of youngsters being media-assassinated and hunted
down for innocently having bought a few for their group.

Lives are regularly and frequently ruined on the basis of socially selling and sharing
materials which are not only in general use, but are often benign and relatively
harmless. A modern day witch hunt of stigmatisation and hostile pursuit persists
unabated, against members of the public who are in most cases as ordinary and law
abiding as you or I.

This misrepresentation of whole swathes of society is culturally embedded in western
society. One would imagine that future historians will look back on this period as one
of crass ignorance and brutal intolerance.

Drug dealers are people too, and human rights should apply to everyone.

NOTE: DEALING WITH STREET VENDORS
Even though vendors do not usually resemble the media presentation, when
purchasing drugs illegally it is sensible to use common sense and observe a number
of safety precautions. These will normally be dictated by circumstance, but generally,
if trading in person, it is wise to have full cognisance of your physical security,
particularly if you are purchasing from a stranger.

Don’t ignore your instincts, and never allow your enthusiasm for the product to cloud
your judgement. Consider whether you would place yourself in a particular situation
if you were purchasing, for example, a consumer product or a food item. Equally,
whatever your relationship with the vendor, the substance you obtain should always
be subject to the harm reduction measures outlined in the first section of this book.

Whilst drug dealers are hardly likely to intentionally poison their customers, it must
be borne in mind that they are usually one part of a chain, having obtained the
material elsewhere. Often they will not have any more certainty regarding the safety
or the purity of the drug than you do. Never make assumptions.

[The WorldScape]

ANECDOTAL TALE (THE NERVOUS DEALER)
It was in the warmth of a perfect summer afternoon, as I lounged smoking
Amsterdam’s finest in Rembrandtplein with a colleague, that a short cropped man of
east European origin approached us. He had been chatting to a group of fellow
people-watchers, who were also toking, a few yards away on the grass.

He introduced himself politely with a bit of small talk, and then offered a toke of his
own joint. “It’s called sputnik” he volunteered, stating that it was Russian and was
very strong indeed.

I obliged, and passed it back to him, whilst my friend abstained. It was indeed strong.

“Would you like some ecstasy or cocaine?” he asked.

I responded with the obvious answer (which was no), explaining that I was due to
leave the following morning and didn’t want a heavy night. We continued to chat for
a few minutes, largely about the drug scene, and he then departed to his next port of
call, another group who were sitting further to our left.

That incident would never have been recalled, if we hadn’t seen him again a few
hours later.

As we sat by a canal, again chilling, and sipping a drink, he walked slowly past.
Whilst we saw him coming, he didn’t notice our particular table. As he came closer
his eyes eventually focused upon us. He momentarily froze, as he tried to recollect.
Then, startled, he darted off at speed.

Given that he was smoking a paranoia-inducing strain of cannabis his logic had
clearly flowed along the lines of:

\`\`\`
Drug selling – From earlier - They are following me – They are cops!
\`\`\`
The moral of the story isn’t just that dealers are susceptible to the same drug effects
as everyone else, it is also that you shouldn’t use even a benign plant like cannabis
when you are relying on sound judgement to do your job safely and sensibly.

THE DARKNET MARKETS
The darknet, accessed via the Tor browser, emerged as a major source of drugs
during the legal high years. Individual markets have come and gone, with The Silk
Road undoubtedly being the most famous. Following its demise others appeared to
successively take the mantle of the most popular.

\`\`\`
Empire became the largest darknet market circa 2019
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
White House Market found increased popularity after the fall of Empire
\`\`\`
Markets, of course, operate via the use of cryptocurrencies, and critically, support
encryption/PGP communication between buyers and sellers. Most eventually fall
victim to seizure or exit scam. At time of writing, only a handful of major players
have closed gracefully and in a controlled manner.

[The WorldScape]

Markets which have existed during the years in which I wrote this book, in no
particular order, include: Dream Market, Wall Street Market, Cannazon, Nightmare
Market, Empire Market, AlphaBay, Torrez Market, The Versus Project, Monopoly
Market, White House Market, DarkOde, World Market, ASAP Market, The Majestic
Garden, Silk Road 2, Agora, Hansa, Cannahome, Tor Market, Pandora, Dark Market,
Hydra, Invictus, Berlusconi Market, TradeRoute, Cryptonia Market, Icarus Market,
Aurora Market, Tochka Market , Tor2door Market, Kingdom Market, Cartel Market,
DarkFox Market, Incognito Market , Avaris, Samsara Market, Apollon Market,
Valhalla, Evolution.

Around these markets a social media type infrastructure developed, which enabled
user interaction regarding both the markets themselves and the individual vendors
operating within them, many of whom also participated.

Over recent years the most significant such platform has been Dread, which offers a
Reddit-like interface and which embraces a substantial number of related topics,
including, to its credit, personal safety and harm reduction.

Reddit itself, and occasionally other clearnet platforms, do sometimes provide space
for darknet discussion, but this is almost always limited in nature due to legal,
regulatory and other constraints.

Finally, it is worth stressing that the use of darknet markets inevitably comes with a
degree of risk, which includes the obvious issues of potential detection by law
enforcement and the possibility of being scammed. It should go without saying that
should you choose to take this path these are matters which require significant
consideration, research and preparation.

4.4.5 The Role of The Media

The media plays a central role in perpetuating the war on drugs and preserving the
landscape of ignorance with respect to essential safety information. I wrote the
following article subsequent to the publication of the first edition of this book. It was
initially published by the drug charity Release.

\`\`\`
THE FIRST CASUALTY OF WAR
Truth is the first casualty of war and the war on drugs is no different. Every
day both the print and broadcast media bombard the public with a perspective
and narrative which has proved to be devastating. This diet of cultural
influence and propaganda is unremitting.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
The broad consensus behind this is a clear example of groupthink, and it
persists across almost the entire mainstream. It is so ingrained in western
journalism that it is prosecuted almost blindly, rendering journalists to be an
integral part of the problem.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
With this in mind, and with no end in sight, I recently considered the question
of how journalists could reintroduce objectivity and truth back into drug
reporting. What could be done to ground reports outside a paradigm which is
neither factual nor humane?
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
I concluded that for conscientious journalists, those instilled with sincerity
and candour, this wouldn't take much effort at all. Indeed, the framing of a
code of ethics almost became an exercise in stating the obvious:
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
A CODE OF ETHICS FOR HONEST DRUG REPORTING
\`\`\`
1. The cause of tragedy and death is the erroneous use of drugs, not the
drugs themselves. This usually stems from a lack of safety awareness
and knowledge with respect to the specific drug or drugs in question.
Reports should therefore be framed in this context.

[The WorldScape]

2. Always include the intrinsic and central details in reports. For
example, don’t routinely use the generic word drugs to cover
substances which are absolutely diverse in nature, effect and potential
harm. This wide scale practice is a de facto inhibitor of accuracy,
education and understanding.
3. Cultural bias tends to suppress awareness of relative harms, which in
Western society severely exacerbates alcohol related problems and
misrepresents far more benign options. Effort should be made to
reduce and eliminate this tendency.

\`\`\`
Specifically, alcohol is a hard addictive drug and should be cited and
reported as such when appropriate. Do not hesitate to cast this drug
(alcohol) in the comparative context of other drugs when reporting on
it, and vice versa.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
Within this, review the use of stilted terminology. For instance, why do
alcohol users drink their drug, whilst users of other drugs abuse theirs?
Why do alcohol sources sell their product, whilst sources of other drugs
push theirs?
\`\`\`
4. In the context of drug use the mantra ‘Ignorance Kills, Education
Saves Lives’ is a statement of fact. Journalists can help to educate by
reporting harm reduction and safety information whenever an
opportunity is presented.

\`\`\`
Routinely quote harm reduction charities such as Release and
DanceSafe, and directly recycle the personal safety data provided by
sources such as TripSit and The Drug Users Bible.
\`\`\`
5. The police frequently inflate the market value of their drug hauls for
self interest, and defending solicitors will commonly consider it trite or
provocative to challenge this in court. This misinformation perverts the
course of justice and serves to re-enforce the destructive narrative of
the war on drugs.

\`\`\`
When reporting, qualify police claims or independently research the
actual value.
\`\`\`
6. Substances like datura and nutmeg are deliriants, and are dysphoric
and highly toxic. Don’t use words like trip to describe their effects, and
don’t refer to them as psychedelics. This is a good example of
misleading terminology inciting potentially fatal consequences.
7. Report actual and factual impact data with respect to the war on
drugs. For example, with 5% of the world’s population the United
States now holds 25% of the world’s prison population, whilst the
number of overdose deaths has soared.

[The WorldScape]

\`\`\`
At the very least don’t repeat the war on drugs precept as though it
isn’t challenged.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
Within this, don’t pursue a narrative which demonises drug users or
drug sellers. Bear in mind that 250 million people use drugs, and most
sellers are ordinary citizens who started buying drugs for friends as well
as themselves.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
Individually, to hold sovereign and exclusive ownership of one's own
conscious mind, to explore freely and without boundary, is surely the
most fundamental of human rights. Third party intrusion into this
wholly personal territory is a grievous breach of this inalienable
freedom.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
It is entirely reasonable to reflect this perspective in reports,
particularly with respect to psychedelics.
\`\`\`
8. Don’t allow politicians or their servants (including the police) to set
the agenda and define talking points, as again, they have a tendency to
promote the war on drugs perspective for self interest.

\`\`\`
Always be aware that the role of journalism is to report objectively,
rather than disseminate propaganda.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
None of these are outrageously difficult to embrace, at least if the pursuit of
truth is the objective (as it should be). I would also suggest that collectively
they almost present a good measure of personal integrity for any journalist
who is aware of them.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
Indeed, I would bluntly ask: if you are reporting in this field, and you are not
following these or something similar to them, why not? What position are you
seeking to promote, and for whom?
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
The continued diet of censorship, misreporting and dishonesty is perpetuating
ignorance and costing lives. Real people, vulnerable people, are suffering and
dying partly as a result of the current role of mainstream journalism in a
brutal and unwinnable war.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
Drugs users’ lives matter too, and some of the blood is surely on the hands of
those who continue to engage as a blunt instrument of state.
\`\`\`
With few exceptions the media is an integral part of the social fabric and machinery
which sustains the cycle of misery, death and mass incarceration described earlier in
this book.

Should you have any contact with a mainstream journalist, always remember that he
or she will almost invariably represent the proprietor’s agenda and will usually have
a pre-prepared narrative. Tread very carefully and don’t invest trust lightly.

[The WorldScape]

SOCIAL MEDIA
Unfortunately, the behemoths of social media are not immune from these issues.
Often spurred on by tabloid hysteria, their approach usually takes the form of censor
now, ask questions (or ignore) later. The responses of Twitter and Reddit regarding
the advertising of the first edition of this book provide a case in point:

Meanwhile, Facebook routinely purges groups like Sesh Safety, which is dedicated to
saving lives via provision of non-judgemental impartial help and advice:

Content platforms are equally problematic. For example, by limiting its referential
sources broadly to approved media conglomerates and corporations, Wikipedia
perpetuates and re-enforces the position of the mainstream. In practical terms this
equates to a form of censorship by citation, and it is extremely effective.

In terms of diversity and the sharing of factual information, the Internet is shrinking
under the shadow of the war on drugs. At time of writing it appears that this may get
worse before it gets better.

4.4.6 Mandatory Drug Testing

Mandatory drug testing is not limited to law enforcement situations. Increasingly it
is being used by employers, and not only with respect to roles which have health and
safety implications.

It is a practice which is open to misuse, and one which again tends to present drug
use as a criminal rather than a health issue. In many scenarios it is a serious threat to
privacy, and to civil and human rights. Whilst the scale and gravity of this will differ
from nation to nation, there is little doubt that it is now an escalating global problem.

DRUG DETECTION PERIODS
For the drug user the spectre of drug testing raises a number of fundamental
questions: How long does evidence of drug use stay in the system? Will the type of
test being used influence the results? How do different drugs compare in terms of
detection times?

There are a lot of variables here, relating to all sorts of issues, including your use of
the drug (e.g. frequency and RoA) and your personal physiology. In addition, I found
enormous discrepancies between different data sources: there simply wasn’t a
universally agreed norm for some of these figures.

For these reasons I almost omitted this segment from the book. Its inclusion
therefore comes with a waiver: it provides only the broadest of indications and it
should not be taken as gospel. If drug testing is a particularly significant issue for
you, make sure that you further research the specific drug in question.

HOW TO PASS A DRUG TEST?
The Internet is awash with ideas on how to pass a drug test: other than by not using
drugs. A lot of these are blatantly flawed, but others may have merit. Here I will
simply list some current information and outline a number of the more credible
suggestions.

At the outset it is important to consider the context of the drug test. Usually this will
be related to employment or to a court case (or other judicial scenario). These two
situations will present different challenges. For example, for the latter you are more
likely to be observed whilst providing a urine sample.

It is important to determine, in advance, as much about the testing procedure as you
are able; perhaps by asking colleagues or seeking advice from appropriate third
parties. This can help you to formulate your strategy and approach, and to decide
how to proceed (based possibly on what you believe you can get away with).

I should point out here, however, that in some places a number of these strategies
might be considered to constitute fraud, and you might be committing a criminal
offence if you follow them. Do your homework on these issues prior to proceeding
down any particular path.

Generally, the options available will depend upon the type of test (urine, blood,
saliva, hair). Nevertheless, there are a couple of general steps which apply to them
all, and which are very straight forward.

The first is that you can abstain from drugs from the moment you know that you are
going to be tested. From this point you can also start to detox naturally, even if this
means just drinking plenty of water every day, to flush your system. Exercising and
being active will also help, although don’t do too much on the day of the test or the
day before. Finally, eat healthily, don’t diet, and don’t skip breakfast.
.
The second is to record a list of all your legitimate medications to submit to the
testing facility. As some prescription and over-the-counter medicines, and some
herbal remedies, can cause a false positive, it is sensible to provide details of genuine
medical use prior to taking the test.

The most commonly cited approaches for each type of test are as follows:

\`\`\`
URINE TESTS
These are presently the most widely used. You will be required to submit a
sample of your urine, which can usually be produced privately; but not always.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
The tests themselves vary. However, the most popular is currently the
5-Panel Urine Test. This usually detects the following drugs: cannabis;
cocaine; opiates; PCP; amphetamines. More stringent is the 10-Panel Urine
Test, which typically also includes: benzodiazepines; barbiturates; MDMA;
various prescription drugs (e.g. oxycodone and methadone); methaqualone.
Added to this may be other drugs, like alcohol.
\`\`\`

[The WorldScape]

\`\`\`
If you can determine which drugs are to be targeted, clearly these are the ones
to address with your countermeasures, and at the very least, to avoid using in
the interim.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
Methods sometimes used to influence the result of a urine test include the
following:
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
Use of Masking Agents
This is basically the trick of adding something (e.g. a commercial
product) to your sample before handing it over. Apparently these
additives used to work well, but now are often detected, and tend to
result in an automatic failure. If you are thinking of using this approach
do your homework first.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
Dilution
Dilution is the act of adding fluid (e.g. water) to your sample, or
alternatively, drinking a lot of water prior to the test. However, this too
is widely recognized by labs, some of which do check for it. Note also
that heavy dilution changes the colour of the urine to clear, which
makes it pretty obvious that an attempt has been made to subvert the
result. Some detoxifiers (see below) contain colorants to help address
this.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
A better approach may be pre-hydration. Urine will have its highest
drug concentration early in the morning, so drinking a few cups of
water may help to flush this a little, and enable you to urinate naturally
prior to doing so for the test itself.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
Use of Detoxifiers
Drug test detoxifiers are often used in conjunction with dilution. These
change the urine composition, and are consumed prior to the test. I
encountered multiple claims that they can be effective, although again
there is some risk that the lab may detect them, or not: this is a non-
static relationship, with suppliers frequently updating their formulas to
try to beat detection techniques.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
It’s your call, but it is worth noting that not all detoxifiers are the same,
and some have been reviewed side-by-side for their comparative
effectiveness. I would suggest therefore that you research intensively to
arm yourself with current information. Detoxifiers are sold in head
shops and online.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
If you have the luxury of time before the test, you might wish to buy a
home testing kit and check how your detoxifier stacks up against it. On
the other side of the coin, if a test is likely to be bounced upon you at
short notice, it might be a good idea to have a detox agent on standby, if
this is your preferred option.
\`\`\`

[The WorldScape]

\`\`\`
Substitution
Using someone else’s urine is an obvious temptation, but it may not be
as simple as it appears. The first risk is that the substitute urine may
also fail the test due to drug use (how well do you know the volunteer?).
Another consideration is that urine turns darker as time passes. Then
of course there is the issue of getting the urine itself into the facility and
actually substituting it.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
Premixed and synthetic urine (e.g. powdered) also comes with a risk of
detection: labs are generally aware that these are on the market and do
look-out for them. Having stated this, there are many claims that some
of them do work. Again, it is best to acquire some expertise if you
intend to take this route. Investigate carefully.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
Another issue which I should point out is that if you are likely to be
tested repeatedly over time, there is a possibility that the difference in
urine composition between tests might be identified.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
One note on temperature: testing staff are not stupid. If you hand over
a stone cold sample it is very obvious that it has not come from your
body.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
A final word on urine tests: don’t celebrate too early... meaning that you
shouldn’t head directly for your drug immediately after the test. You may be
called back for a re-test, so wait until the test results are confirmed before
making assumptions.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
HAIR FOLLICLE TESTS
For these, about 1.5 inches of hair is normally taken, usually from the head. If
you are bald, the sample of hair will be taken from elsewhere.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
With this type of test long term use is more likely to be detected than a one-off
experiment, although this too could be identified. Also note that very recent
drug use may not show up (hence urine and hair tests are sometimes used
together).
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
A 5-Panel Test exists for hair, broadly equating to the urine panel test. There
are also extended versions (e.g. 12-Panel) and other drugs may be added.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
As the sample is usually taken directly from you, substitution and some of the
other methods covered for urine tests will not work. However, there are still a
number of frequently cited options which may or may not have merit. Most of
these come in the form of specialist detoxification shampoos and rinses.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
First and foremost, if you use these make sure that they are safe, and be
careful when you wash with them. Note that to enhance the prospects of
success you will normally need to use them for some days beforehand,
although of course, late is better than never.
\`\`\`

[The WorldScape]

\`\`\`
Other methods suggested include the use of salicylic acid, white vinegar,
laundry detergent and temporary hair dye. If you opt to try these, again be
careful whilst using them.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
Finally, I have read about people using bleach on their hair and claiming
success, frequently when used in combination with a detoxifying shampoo. I
would urge some caution here: not just because using bleach on yourself is a
risk, but because you don’t want to walk into the workplace (for example) with
different coloured hair to usual.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
As with other test types, there is a huge market supplying all sorts of
commercial products, so check this out if you intend to walk this path.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
SALIVA TESTS
Given that the saliva sample is likely to be taken there and then, the options to
beat this are limited. However, the good news is that most drugs can only be
detected in saliva for a few days after use.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
The pre-test regime here is fairly obvious. First of all, brush your teeth
thoroughly: I mean thoroughly (but not hard enough to cause bleeding),
taking in all of your mouth. Using mouthwash and eating can also have a
temporary effect, perhaps for 20 or 30 minutes.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
Note that regarding the mouthwash, the alcohol content of some brands can
sometimes present a risk, depending on the test being used. However, there
are specialist drug-toxin mouthwashes on the market which may be a better
bet. Oral gum is another product type I have seen suggested.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
Again, with this method you can buy a decent quality home testing kit to check
whether it works for you (at least using the kit) prior to the event.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
BLOOD TESTS
Blood testing is clearly the most invasive approach. Given that the sample is
taken directly from you by a third party it presents obvious difficulties in
terms of manipulating the outcome. However, in addition to the general steps
cited at the start of this section, you could try using a high quality drug
detoxifier to improve your odds.
\`\`\`
Whilst the above may be helpful, it is important to bear in mind that this is a
changing landscape and information does become outdated. Also, although it is a
mature marketplace and the Internet is your friend (sometimes), be careful: if you
are seeking a product don’t plump for the first one that you encounter. Find social
media discussions, third party review sites and other sources that will help you to
take decisions on an informed and current basis.

Remember too that the only guaranteed way to beat a test is not to engage in drug
use for the requisite period beforehand.

4.4.7 Activism: The Charter of Drug Users Rights

Drug users across the world are prosecuted, persecuted and marginalized. However,
in recent years there have been indications of a grassroots counterresponse to this
oppression, albeit one which is still barely perceptible.

One initiative is The Charter Of Drug Users Rights, for which I agreed to write the
script. Although this has not taken off, it is worth reproducing here, hopefully as a
sign of things to come.

The petition itself can be found via the following URL:
https://www.change.org/p/the-united-nations-secretary-general-the-charter-of-
drug-users-rights

###### The Charter of Drug Users Rights

\`\`\`
According to the UN there are a quarter of a BILLION drug users globally,
which is more than the entire populations of the UK, France and Germany
combined. This is a significant minority of the world's population.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
There are a myriad of reasons why these individuals take drugs, but usually
they make a proactive decision to do so. In other words, they adopt a
primordial right to choose what to put into their OWN bodies, and they
choose how to change their OWN consciousness.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
Unfortunately, these innate personal freedoms are largely denied and
proscribed by states and governments. Non-violent citizens are arrested,
criminalized and imprisoned, for no other reason than that they have
exercised this fundamental human right with respect to THEMSELVES.
\`\`\`

[The WorldScape]

\`\`\`
This (often violent) oppression is augmented and sustained via media
coverage which ignores and marginalizes the victims' interests and
perspectives. Mainstream output invariably aligns with a destructive war on
drugs narrative, and excludes direct and factual information/news which
would save lives. The aggressive flow of ideologically based propaganda is
unrelenting, whilst even the most basic harm-reduction initiatives, remain
totally unreported and largely unknown.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
This unremitting flood of unbalanced journalism manifestly serves to re-
enforce the stigma and hostility endured by what has become a socially
persecuted minority. Drug users have no voice, no statutory protection, and
nowhere to turn.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
With their civil and human rights being routinely and systematically violated
across the world the picture could hardly be bleaker. It is a level of abuse and
degradation which for any other minority would be widely recognised and
condemned. Even the term itself, drug user, has been so misappropriated that
it has become pejorative, placing anyone thus referenced outside the orbit of
normal moral consideration.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
It is within this desperate and harrowing context that the following demands
are presented:
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
 The immediate cessation of the war on drugs.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
 Drug dependency and addiction to be treated as health issues
rather than criminal matters.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
 The release of all imprisoned non-violent drug offenders, and
all convictions for non-violent drug offences to be expunged.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
 Recognition of the right to use drugs recreationally, inclusive of
social parity with alcohol users, and a cessation of cultural and
other forms of discrimination.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
 Urgent repeal and reform of global drug treaties to expedite the
above, with new drug related legislation framed to recognise
the supremacy of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights
and its application to all.

HUMAN RIGHTS, POLITICAL IMPRISONMENT & STATE TERRORISM
To hold sovereign and exclusive ownership of one's own conscious mind, to explore
freely and without boundary, is surely the most fundamental of human rights. Or,
reflecting this in the first person: to determine what I put into my own body, causing
no harm to anybody else, is my own affair and not that of a third party or state.

These rights are indirectly enshrined within both the UN’s Universal Declaration of
Human Rights and the Bill of Rights to the US Constitution, but regardless, they are
held as canon by the rational and reasonable across our planet.

It clearly follows that to forbid the use of psychoactive materials, which are often
naturally occurring botanicals, is a gross and direct infringement of these inalienable
freedoms. Ipso facto prohibition is self-evidently a wilful exercise of external control
over the individual’s mind and body; an undeniable constraint on personal liberty.

Equally, the categorical and unambiguous breach of these rights is an unequivocal
political act in statute, decree and enforcement. By definition this renders anyone
imprisoned for contravention of this mandate to be a person imprisoned for their
political beliefs or actions, which is the textbook definition of a political prisoner.

In this context the war on drugs constitutes a brutal and unremitting exercise of
state sponsored persecution and oppression. It can reasonably be regarded as
organised terrorism on a global scale, targeting those who choose to exercise the
politically proscribed human right of perturbing their own consciousness. It is a war
of terror, explicitly terrorising users of drugs and their families.

Death, addiction, mass incarceration, and appalling social wreckage are inevitable
consequences when the machinery and propaganda of state are ruthlessly and
mercilessly turned upon innocent citizens in this manner. Historians will surely view
this as an age of barbaric ignorance and cruelty, and will castigate the perpetrators
accordingly.

4.5 Drug Tourism

Despite the unremitting onslaught of the war on drugs, some territories remain of
particular interest with respect to psychoactives. During the research period for this
book I visited a number of them; some as specific destinations and others in transit.
This section presents a brief overview of a handful of these, in no particular order.

Amsterdam is afforded its own segment not only on the basis of its currently liberal
and relatively civilised approach to drugs, but because I tended to use it as a base for
both exploration and travel.

Note that I do not offer legal advice on the current state of play within any nation,
but rather, I present potential points of interest for the travelling psychonaut. Always
check the legal landscape before you plan a visit to any territory in which you intend
to engage in any drug related activity.

4.5.1 The Dutch Connection (Amsterdam)

There isn’t really a Dutch connection, other than that the Netherlands is a major
source of a number of popular recreational drugs (e.g. MDMA). However, there is
Amsterdam, where a substantial number of international tourists go to enjoy the
coffeeshops and the more tolerant and civilised attitude to drugs generally. This book
would therefore not be complete without a brief overview of this scene, from the
perspective of the foreign visitor.

As a customer, there are three main sources of interest: coffeeshops (for cannabis),
seed banks (for seeds) and smart shops (for legal chemicals, botanicals and
paraphernalia). Whilst these are dotted across the centre of Amsterdam, they are not
all equal in terms of quality or value, and research is suggested prior to any visit.

To create some sort of picture of the situation on the ground, during 2017 I visited a
small number of the most reputable of these outlets, and presented a series of
questions to a member of staff in each. The responses are produced below.

AMSTERDAM: GENERAL SAFETY ADVICE
It is important to note that, when in Amsterdam, your normal safety regime should
not be suspended. However, some aspects of this are far easier to implement than
elsewhere. An example of this is with respect to testing.

Several facilities exist which, for a nominal fee, will test your drug anonymously. The
details of these are as follows:

\`\`\`
GGD Amsterdam,
Valckenierstraat 4,
1018 XG Amsterdam
+3120-5555450
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
http://www.ggd.amsterdam.nl
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
Jellinek,
Jacob Obrechtstraat 92,
1071 KG Amsterdam
+3120-5901590
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
http://www.jellinek.nl
\`\`\`
On my visit to the GGD’s premises I was fortunate enough to bump into someone
connected with the service, and was able to gather some background information. I
discovered that the main target for the service was unsurprisingly Dutch nationals.
Tourists are accepted, but bear in mind that for other than basic reagent checks and
database research, full laboratory tests sometimes take more than a week.

Their busiest time of year is usually festival season (the backend of summer), and at
the time of my visit (August 2017) the most common drugs submitted for testing
were ecstasy/MDMA, cocaine, ketamine and 2CB, in that order. There is a limit of 3
samples per person.

One piece of general advice I would offer from personal experience is not to overdo it.
It is extremely easy to smoke too much of a strong strain, or to over indulge with
truffles.

If you plan a heavy trip, engage it with a safety net, perhaps in close proximity to
your hotel, or in a place where you can safely relax, away from crowds. Always have a
sitter.

[The WorldScape]

When you are purchasing your truffles, or other material, discuss your wishes with
the vendor, who will be able to advise you, including with respect to dose. If you are
purchasing mushrooms (not from a smart shop, as they are illegal) bear in mind the
difference in weight between wet and dry.

Finally, I have always found Amsterdam to be an extremely friendly city, as
illustrated by the interviews I referred to earlier. If you wish to know more, don’t
hesitate to ask local aficionados.

TOURIST TIPS
For cannabis enthusiasts the Hash, Marijuana & Hemp Museum, on the fringe of the
red light area, is a decent choice.

The entrance fee isn’t cheap, but following perusal of a substantial number of
documents, images, paraphernalia and historical exhibits, the visit ends with a
punch. Whilst I cannot be certain that this is always provided, on the day I toured,
visitors were offered a free hit via a fancy vaporiser and balloon bag.

[The WorldScape]

Predictably, this gave a very smooth toke, and the cannabis itself provided a nice
slow-burning high.

Further down the same canal (Oudezijds Achterburgwal) is Cannabis College, which
offers advice on the safe use of recreational and medicinal cannabis, as well as a free
tour of its small Cannabis garden (see below).

If you intend to trip on truffles or another psychedelic, Amsterdam is blessed with an
abundance of world class art galleries and museums, to suit every taste. The term
museum dose was not coined without good reason.

Alternatively, for both psychedelics and cannabis, there are many open spaces in
which to relax, not least Vondelpark. Rembrandtplein is one of my personal
favourites for people watching whilst stoned, but there are so many others.

I hesitate to cover alcohol given the available legal alternatives, but there are
breweries (try the one in a windmill: Brouwerij ‘t IJ ), an Icebar, and pubs and bars
galore (try the delightful In de Olofspoort, steeped in history and at time of writing
offering an astonishing array of spirits and gins). Tobacco enthusiasts can head for
P.G.C. Hajenius on Rokin, with its vast selection of cigars and an integral smoking
room.

For me, Amsterdam is a wonderful destination for both relaxation and exploration,
with a surprise around almost every corner. The general vibe is one of charm and
chill, making it absolutely ideal for the discerning and adventurous tourist.

At the risk of them coming across as holiday snaps. I will end this section with some
random images taken during my last few visits:

AN ANECDOTAL TALE (AMSTERDAM)
Sometimes in our drug-paranoid culture, events transpire and can take a bizarre
twist. An example occurred when I found myself at Schiphol Airport, Amsterdam,
with a couple of joints in my pocket.

My schedule was to fly to Asia to research for four days, before returning to Schipol,
where I would be stuck for 6 hours prior to flying out again.

I was therefore confronted with the question of what to do with the joints, given that
taking them with me was out of the question.

My bright idea was to bury them in a plant pot outside the airport terminal building,
so that I could collect them on return, and smoke them during my tedious layover,
passing the time more enjoyably. I found this little beauty just outside a door, and
thrust the water protected goodies under the soil, on the right hand side.

I then happily flew off to complete my mission.

On return, I was greeted with an appalling sight.

Yes, horror of horrors, in just four days, the airport had uprooted everything,
including my joints, and replaced them with bland green vegetation.

Those hours passed particularly slowly.

4.5.2 Destinations of Potential Interest

THE HIPPIE TRAIL
The Hippie Trail was one of the most famed international travel routes of the last
century. It was a journey undertaken by members of the hippie counterculture,
largely from the mid 60s to the mid-late 70s.

Start points were major cities in Western Europe, notably London and Amsterdam.
The route meandered overland to northern India, where it branched into a variety of
end-points, including Goa, Kathmandu, Bangkok and Sri Lanka.

Unfortunately, in practical terms, much of the trail is now inaccessible, not least
Afghanistan, Iran and the Indian/Pakistani border.

The hippie lifestyle often embraced drugs, particularly psychedelics and hashish, and
most of these locations offered an abundance, certainly of the latter. The drugs have
now largely gone, at least in terms of their legal use, but the hippies left a cultural
mark on many of these places which still exists today.

There is no doubt that the Hippie Trail retains a unique place in historical drug
folklore. The following photographs were taken at some of the most fabled and iconic
destinations, along with brief descriptions of some of them.

[The WorldScape]

\`\`\`
Freak Street, Kathmandu
\`\`\`
The Beatles Cathedral, Rishikesh Betel leaves in Sri Lanka

Shiva Valley, Goa

[The WorldScape]

Kathmandu
Freak Street in Kathmandu was the location of a number of government-run hashish
shops. It wasn't far from here that I found the best hash I have ever sampled.
It probably goes without saying that Kathmandu is an absolutely stunning place to
visit, with or without the hash.

Varanasi
Picturesque it is, and most people are familiar with images of the ghats by the side of
the Ganges. It is, however, also another end-point of the hippie-trail. For the
discerning drug tourist there is far more to it than meandering along the banks of
this most famous of rivers. A high-point (pun intended) is that bhang lassi is legal
here, and is served openly throughout the city. I chose The Green Lassi Shop, and
boy did I overdo it (see earlier). The point here is that edibles can bite hard, and I
have found that the hash in this part of the world is almost invariably very high
quality.

Of course, as with so often the case in Asia, if a stim is your thing you can find betel
nuts with relative ease. Other psychoactives can be found here and there.
It's one of those places in which you can still run across links to the hippies of old,
and more of the tourists here are like-minded than is generally found in other iconic
destinations.

As is usually the case in India it is a friendly but full-on experience, which tends to
have many wealthy or middle-class travellers hiding in their hotels or herded in
groups. If you ever make it there, don't do this. Let yourself go and you will be
rewarded with a full and awesome memory bank.

Goa
Not only was Goa an end destination of the hippie trail, which is still evidenced in
various places by the presence of hippie clothes and other cultural reminders, but it
is the point of origin of Goa trance, a style of electronic dance music, from which
psychedelic trance developed. This was to become global phenomena, and indeed a
number of venues, such as Hilltop and Shiva Valley, became internationally famous.

Rishikesh
Rishikesh is probably best known as the yoga capital of the world. Whilst this may set
the scene, there is far more to it; including the Beatles ashram, Hindu/Buddhist
culture and vegetarian food... all along the banks of the sacred Ganges.

What more could you want? Drugs I guess, which were probably within reach,
particularly cannabis given its ancient connection to Hinduism. Whilst I didn't score
any conventional drugs I did experience shirodhara (the pouring of hot/cold oils onto
my forehead, over the pineal gland). The resultant psychedelic flashes were as weird
as they were unexpected, but they were real enough for me to document in this book.

Overall Rishikesh left such an impression that I have visited India many times since,
and will be doing so again in the future. If you ever get the chance to visit, take it.

[The WorldScape]

Bangkok
Whilst Bangkok has developed massively since the original hippie trail emerged,
some reminders remain. For example Khao San Road is still a popular destination for
backpackers, the countless temples still provide a serene and contrasting vibe, flea
markets are numerous and accommodation for independent travellers spans the city.
Drugs these days are of course harder to find and the risks of falling foul of draconian
laws should not to be ignored. Note though that at time of writing (2022) both
cannabis and kratom are legal, with the former being openly and widely available.

Khao San Road Wat Arun

NINE MILE, JAMAICA
Weed is currently legal in Jamaica, which is something I took full advantage of on
arrival. However, the highlight of my expedition was undoubtedly a visit to Bob
Marley's mausoleum at Nine Mile.

The trip up there is difficult, inclusive of winding almost single-track roads,
sometimes with death defying drops to the side. However, the locale itself presented
both views and a wealth of material on Bob and his music; and of course with plenty
of reference to cannabis.

Outside the gate his (allegedly) favourite, sensimilla, was on sale, plus edibles in the
form of chocolate cake. This was amongst the best weed I have ever sampled, but I
consider myself lucky not to have gone with the cake: it was so strong that one young
woman couldn't take the combination of the high altitude and high THC, and she
collapsed on an exhibit.

[The WorldScape]

This is undoubtedly an iconic drug related tourist destination, and is well worth the
effort of getting there.

CUSCO, PERU
The two places most people tend to visit for an ayahuasca experience are Cusco and
Iquitos in Peru. I chose the former.

The experience itself was of course undertaken at a nearby retreat, but the city itself
was a worthy destination in its own right, and not just because of its proximity to
Machu Picchu.

There were hints of psychedelia in a number of locations there, as well as imagery
and art clearly influenced by the ayahuasca experience on sale. It was also hard to
miss that bookings for ayahuasca ceremonies could be made locally via numerous
well-signed outlets, and that the place was well stocked with vegetarian and vegan
restaurants.

Another local delicacy was coca, in the form of leaves, from which cocaine is of
course derived. This had a minor stimulating effect, but I personally consumed it in a
failed attempt to avoid altitude sickness. A little harder to find, but there
nonetheless, was the opportunity to sample san pedro cactus, which only the
aforementioned illness prevented me from indulging.

PRAGUE, CZECH REPUBLIC
Prague has historically been a centre for alchemy, and indeed, it is home to the
UNESCO Heritage site, Speculum Alchemiae, which is a dedicated museum. It is also
home to the John Lennon wall. He liked his LSD did our John, so I suspect that he'd
have liked how trippy this turned out. This has been there since the 1980s.

Given that it is the capital of the Czech Republic, it isn't surprising that Prague has a
Bohemian vibe to it. It also seems to be relaxed with respect to drugs, with Vice
reporting that: "Weed is widely tolerated, and there are some bars where the smell
will hit you as soon as you walk by. People also generally get away with smoking
on the street, as long as they don't exhale directly into a cop's face—though it is still
illegal, of course, and there's no guarantee that you won't get into trouble if you
catch an officer on a bad day."

[The WorldScape]

Another speciality is absinthe, with dedicated bars and even absinthe ice cream
dotted around the centre. Absinthe of course contains the (mildly) psychoactive
plant, wormwood (which is covered in this book).

\`\`\`
Museum of Alchemy
\`\`\`
SOUTH EAST ASIA
Although this is no longer a place to engage, due to particularly barbaric drug
policies, I managed to sneak in a magic mushroom experience whilst they were still
legal in Bali (Indonesia). During their heyday they were not only sold openly, but
were glaringly advertised.

[The WorldScape]

On my visits to cities like Chiang Mai (Thailand) and Mandalay (Myanmar), betel
nuts were the name of the game, particularly in the former, where street vendors
were a common sight.

FREETOWN CHRISTIANIA, COPENHAGEN, DENMARK
Wikipedia’s rather dry entry describes Christiania in the following terms: “Freetown
Christiania, also known as Christiania, is an intentional community and commune
in the Danish capital city of Copenhagen. It began in 1971 as a squatted military
base. Its Pusher Street is famous for its open trade of cannabis, which is illegal in
Denmark“

I found it to be a vibrant colourful and lively place, with workshops, art studios,
market stalls, a range of food and drink outlets, and more, all presented in an
alternative cultural setting. And of course cannabis was very much available, with
park and spare land on hand in which to chill (if engaging).

It lacks the scale of, say, Amsterdam, as does Copenhagen itself, but there is certainly
a good few hours to be spent here for the discerning drug tourist.

[The WorldScape]

SAN FRANCISCO, USA
San Francisco was the last of my research destinations, although it should arguably
have been the first given its pivotal position during the years of the counter culture
revolution. This was centred in the Haight-Ashbury district, but there is more to the
city than a hippy vibe and the associated landmarks which reflect an era in which
everything seemed to be possible.

At time of writing recreational cannabis is currently legal, with retail outlets dotted
here and there. Indeed, the pungent odour of the weed is at times hard to escape on
busy streets. Kratom is openly advertised and sold, and there are a couple of kava
bars, which unfortunately were closed due to COVID-related issues.

For trippers there are a variety of art galleries and walks, and if lucky, a ride over the
bridge with Scott McKenzie’s timeless San Francisco playing in the cab. Street
graffiti adds colour, but as with so many US cities, the number of homeless and drug-
afflicted individuals currently casts a tragic shadow over any visit.

Nonetheless, San Francisco is something of a must-do, particularly for that
connection to a bygone age.

4.6 CULTURE & SOCIETY (REFERENCE)

The impact of drugs and drug use on modern culture is profound. As subject matter,
drugs have been integral to some of the most highly acclaimed examples of their
genre. Equally, some of the finest works ever created have been inspired by the drug
experience itself. Whilst I cannot possibly do justice to this aspect over just a handful
of pages, I will attempt to scratch its surface.

Within this canopy, I will also present some ideas for psychedelic exploration, and
offer a more traditional book reference and reading list, which I hope will be of value.

4.6.1 Art, Film, Literature, Music

As we are deep into subjective territory here, instead of rattling off my personal
opinion, I will furnish selected lists of prominent and well known artists and works,
which may stimulate interest or deliberation.

MOVIES
Some are about drugs; some are inspired by drugs; some have themes which are
undeniably linked to drugs; some are frequently claimed to be best watched whilst
experiencing drugs:

Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1998)
Trainspotting (1996)
The Wall (1982)
Limitless (2011)
The Matrix (1999)
Enter the Void (2009)

Embrace of the Serpent (2015)
Mr Nice (2010)
The Mule (2018)
The Doors (1991)
Blow (2001)
The Beatles: Yellow Submarine (1968)
\`\`\`
PROPAGANDA MOVIES
These may appear to be ridiculous now, but propaganda in more sophisticated forms
is still in full flow.

The Cocaine Fiends (1935)
Marihuana (1936)
Reefer Madness (1936)
The Road To Ruin (1934)
She Shoulda Said No! (1949)
Devil’s Harvest (1942)
Assassin of Youth (1937)
Human Wreckage (1923)

[The WorldScape]

MUSIC COMPOSITIONS
Some of these selections are psychedelic in nature (particularly interesting to listen
to whilst tripping) whilst others are (sometimes reputably) about drugs or the effects
of drugs. A difficulty I encountered in constructing this list was the sheer number of
compositions to choose from. If I have missed your favourite artist or recording, I
apologise.

COSTUME
According to Wikipedia, "Costume is the distinctive style of dress of an individual or
group that reflects their class, gender, profession, ethnicity, nationality, activity or
epoch". So what costume is distinctive to drug users? Given that drug users form part
of every social group this is a tricky one. However, if any, perhaps psychedelic and/or
hippie type clothing is more synonymous with drug use than any other.

QUOTATION
Celebrities and cultural icons have long commented on drugs and drug use. A
collection of some of the most well known quotes is presented below. For quotes
specific to psychedelics see the introduction to Section 2.2.

“I don't do drugs. I am drugs.” ~ Salvador Dali

“Drugs are a bet with your mind.” ~ Jim Morrison

“I have absolutely no pleasure in the stimulants in which I sometimes so madly
indulge. It has not been in the pursuit of pleasure that I have periled life and
reputation and reason. It has been the desperate attempt to escape from torturing
memories, from a sense of insupportable loneliness and a dread of some strange
impending doom.” ~ Edgar Allan Poe

"It's not a war on drugs, it's a war on personal freedom." ~ Bill Hicks

“If you want to understand a society, take a good look at the drugs it uses. And
what can this tell you about American culture? Well, look at the drugs we use.
Except for pharmaceutical poison, there are essentially only two drugs that
Western civilization tolerates: Caffeine from Monday to Friday to energize you
enough to make you a productive member of society, and alcohol from Friday to
Monday to keep you too stupid to figure out the prison that you are living in.” ~ Bill
Hicks

"Marijuana is self-punishing. It makes you acutely sensitive, and in this world,
what worse punishment could there be?" ~ P. J. O'Rourke

"No drug, not even alcohol, causes the fundamental ills of society. If we're looking
for the sources of our troubles, we shouldn't test people for drugs, we should test
them for stupidity, ignorance, greed and love of power." ~ P. J. O'Rourke

"I used to have a drug problem, now I make enough money." ~ David Lee Roth

“When you smoke the herb, it reveals you to yourself.” ~ Bob Marley

“Herb is the healing of a nation, alcohol is the destruction.” ~Bob Marley

"I'm very fond of drugs." Grace Slick

“Don't do drugs because if you do drugs you'll go to prison, and drugs are really
expensive in prison.” ~John Hardwick

“Reality is a crutch for people who can't cope with drugs.” ~Lily Tomlin

“Cocaine is God's way of saying you're making too much money.” ~Robin Williams

“I hate to advocate drugs, alcohol, violence or insanity to anyone, but they've
always worked for me." ~ Hunter S. Thompson”

[The WorldScape]

"That is not a drug, it’s a leaf." ~ Arnold Schwarzenegger

"I've never had a problem with drugs. I've had problems with the police." ~ Keith
Richards

"To put someone in jail for using drugs in the privacy of his hotel room is just
barbaric." ~ Danny Sugerman

“Fck the drug war. Dropping acid was a profound turning point for me, a seminal
experience. I make no apologies for it. More people should do acid. It should be sold
over the counter.” ~ George Carlin

"Psychedelic drugs don't change you, they don't change your character, unless you
want to be changed. They enable change; they can't impose it.” ~ Alexander Shulgin

"I'm called the Godfather because I published for the first time information about its
effects in man. I feel content with the title. MDMA is a beautiful drug." ~ Alexander
Shulgin

"I think pot should be legal. I don’t smoke it, but I like the smell of it." ~ Andy
Warhol

"I drifted into heroin because as a kid growing up everybody told me, ‘don’t smoke
marijuana, it will kill you.’" ~ Irvine Welsh

"I didn't inhale." ~ Bill Clinton

"When I was a kid I inhaled frequently. That was the point." ~ Barack Obama

"The illegality of cannabis is outrageous, an impediment to full utilization of a drug
which helps produce the serenity and insight, sensitivity and fellowship so
desperately needed in this increasingly mad and dangerous world." ~ Carl Sagan

"Sex and drugs and rock and roll." ~ Ian Dury

"If you lock someone up for smoking a plant that makes them happy, then you’re
the fcking criminal." ~ Joe Rogan

"Which is better: to have fun with fungi or to have Idiocy with ideology, to have
wars because of words, to have tomorrow's misdeeds out of yesterday's
miscreeds?" ~ Aldous Huxley

"I say no to drugs, but they don't listen." ~ Marilyn Manson

“Our national drug is alcohol. We tend to regard the use of any other drug with
special horror.” ~ William S. Burroughs

"A drug is not bad. A drug is a chemical compound. The problem comes in when
people who take drugs treat them like a license to behave like an asshole." ~ Frank
Zappa

4.6.2 Food For The Psychedelic Mind

If you wish to explore and are stuck for places to start:

Terence McKenna. Head directly to YouTube and find everything from his ‘Stoned
Ape Theory’ to his explanation of the meaning of the ‘I Ching’. It is impossible to do
justice to him in a brief introduction, but the breadth of his psychedelic subject
matter, his astonishing yet plausible theories and his unparalleled eloquence have
rightly elevated him to the status of legend.

Robert Anton Wilson. As referred to in the first section, his contributions to Leary’s
Eight-Circuit Model are singularly instructive. There is one interview in particular
worth looking out for, which is published under a variety of titles, including
‘Techniques of Consciousness Change’ and ‘8 Circuit Psychology’.

Quantum Physics. Have you seen the three Dr Quantum video clips from the ‘What
the Bleep Do We Know!?’ documentary? These are essential viewing if you are
unfamiliar with ‘The Double Slit Experiment’ and ‘Entanglement’, both of which are
fundamental building blocks in the understanding of consciousness and the
construct of perceived reality.

This is also an exceptionally good documentary to watch as a whole. Are you far
enough down the rabbit hole yet?

Morphic Resonance. Check out Dr Rupert Sheldrake’s theory, and its potential
application to consciousness.
[“Morphic resonance is a process whereby self-organising systems inherit a memory from
previous similar systems. In its most general formulation, morphic resonance means that
the so-called laws of nature are more like habits. The hypothesis of morphic resonance also
leads to a radically new interpretation of memory storage in the brain and of biological
inheritance. Memory need not be stored in material traces inside brains, which are more
like TV receivers than video recorders, tuning into influences from the past. And biological
inheritance need not all be coded in the genes, or in epigenetic modifications of the genes;
much of it depends on morphic resonance from previous members of the species. Thus each
individual inherits a collective memory from past members of the species, and also
contributes to the collective memory, affecting other members of the species in the future.”]

This becomes particularly relevant when developed alongside other theories and
ideas. One example: given that optical illusions demonstrate a form of pattern
recognition and that this occurs across the other senses too, the mind is in some ways
a pattern recognition engine. Applying this to memory, your memories may be yours
(rather than collective) because the morphic pattern of your last moment fits your
own last moment better than anyone else’s last moment. Ditto the moment before,
and the moment before that, etc. You thus co-ordinate a point-of-view (this is a

Dennis McKenna. Terence McKenna’s brother, for this quote alone:
“All experience is a drug experience. Whether it's mediated by our own [endogenous]
drugs, or whether it's mediated by substances that we ingest that are found in plants,
cognition, consciousness, the working of the brain, it's all a chemically mediated process.
Life itself is a drug experience.”

The CIA. Eyeball this, remembering that this IS the CIA:
[“This is an aspect of quantum mechanics which applies to the fact that any oscillating
frequency(such as a brainwave) reaches two points of complete rest which constitute the
boundaries of each individual oscillation(i.e. movement up or down). Without these points of
rest, an oscillating wave pattern would be impossible since the points of rest are required to
permit the energy to change direction and thus continue vibrating between rigid limits. But it
is also true that when, for an infinitesimally brief instant, that energy reaches one of its two
points of rest it "clicks out" of time-space and joins infinity(see Exhibit 3, next page). That
critical step out of time-space occurs when the speed of the oscillation drops below 10-33
centimeters per second(Planck's Distance). To use the words of Bentov: 11 ... quantum
mechanics tell us that when distances go below Planck's Distance, which is 10-33 CM, we
enter, in effect, a new worid.11 To return to our case in point, the human consciousness wave
pattern reaches such high frequency that the pattern of "clickouts" comes so close together
that there is virtual continuity in it. Then, a portion of that consciousness is actually
postulated to establish and maintain its information collection function in those dimensions
located between time-space and the Absolute. Thus, as the alrhost continuous "clickout"
pattern establishes itself in continuous phase at speeds below Planck's Distance but before
reaching the state of total rest, human consciousness passes through the looking glass of
time7space after the fashion of Alice beginning her journey into wonderland. The Gateway
experience, with its associated Hemi-Sync technique, is apparently designed, if used
systematically and patiently, to enable human consciousness to establish a coherent pattern
of perception in those dimensions where speeds below Planck's distance apply. This holds
true irrespective of whether the individual is exercising his consciousness while in his
physical body or whether he is doing so after having separated that consciousness from the
physical body(i.e. the so called out-of-body state mentioned earlier).”]

The Dalai Lama. Buddhism? Meditation? Enlightenment? This Dalai Lama quote is
undoubtedly a truism: “Broadly speaking, although there are some differences, I
think Buddhist philosophy and Quantum Mechanics can shake hands on their view
of the world." It is worth seeking out more.

PSYCHEDELIC MUSINGS
Many people use trip time to muse about the nature of self-aware consciousness and
what is commonly referred to as reality. I am no different and I always make an
effort to engage such contemplation, via one thread or another. In the prior section of
this book I provide a number of potential avenues for exploration, chosen more or
less at random. One I don’t refer to is time-deflation, upon which I will pontificate
here as a further example, as hypothesized via my own deliberations.

The Dictionary of Obscures Sorrows defines a word for the impression that time
accelerates as you get older: zenosyne. This is a common manifestation of the human
condition. It can be field tested quite easily; for example, by asking a number of
randomly selected elderly persons whether their last 10 years appeared to pass more
slowly or more quickly than their 10th to 20th years.

Why does this happen? Can I do anything about it? These are questions I have
contemplated often, whilst tripping with a number of different psychedelics. I have
reached some theoretical and tentative conclusions.

To explore this I would first invite you to consider how your experience of life is
constructed. With respect to this I will refer again to Timothy Leary’s eight-circuit
model as further developed by Robert Anton Wilson. In a nutshell, you project your
reality based upon previously made imprints on your individual psyche. On an
ongoing basis your imprints are created via sensory inputs (sights, sounds, etc), with
the strongest being made during the imprint vulnerability stages of your life (largely
childhood). The overall structure frames your personal interpretation of everything
around you, whatever that may be.

At a superficial level I would exemplify this using a simple but well known optical
illusion:

\`\`\`
[Source: Jastrow, J. (1899), via Wikimedia Commons]
\`\`\`
What do you see in the first instance? Some people see a rabbit and others see a
duck; in each case this is based upon instant comparison of immediate sensory input
versus existing imprints from earlier life experiences. This idea embraces all five
senses, not just vision, and it applies similarly to thought. All this occurs sub-
consciously.

Behind the scenes your brain is hallucinating and projecting your conscious reality
by virtue of a pattern recognition process (current input / already existing imprints).

[The WorldScape]

Having digested and embedded this concept, let us consider the boundary between
conscious and sub-conscious.

I contend that repetition breeds subconscious. If you do something often enough you
will stop thinking about it and it will become auto-pilot (subconscious) as its existing
imprints strengthen. Driving a car is a good example of this.

I walk to a swimming pool on most evenings, yet I cannot tell you anything particular
to last night’s walk. However, if you beam me to Timbuktu for a 1k walk I will recall
every sight, sound, and smell from that specific walk long into the future. The latter
walk will create a sequence of new imprinting whilst the former walk won’t. In
Terence Mckenna’s terms it is perhaps a form of habit v novelty, and I should also
cite a potential connection to Rupert Sheldrake’s theory of morphic resonance.

My proposition is that fresh imprints are the reference points around which we build
our future perception of past time. A lengthy period of habitual tedium and thus no
or little imprinting will retrospectively have passed quickly; having been consigned
largely to the subconscious. Conversely, frequent exposure to novel or partially novel
events during a period will invoke a commensurate level of new imprinting, forging
conscious awareness and influencing longer-term perspective; and will thus,
retrospectively, have passed more slowly.

If we take this idea into a six month timeframe and compare a period of habit with a
period of regular novelty, the retrospective human perception of the latter will be
that the time passed much more slowly than the former. This is certainly how it has
always worked out during my own investigation and testing.

Over a lifetime it is inevitable that the older you become the less novelty you will
encounter and the more habit you will embrace. This is fundamental to the perceived
acceleration of time (zenosyne). It follows from this that the intentional introduction
of novel episodes at purposely chosen intervals will decelerate time and will extend
your life experience, at least retrospectively. Try it.

It’s also worth pointing out the obvious: unless you are a regular long term
psychonaut, psychedelic trips themselves are likely to constitute novel episodes. This
too is a phenomenon I have personally observed.

Convinced? Probably not, but I invite you to take some of these ideas and strands
and consider them for yourself, perhaps whilst tripping. You might be surprised at
where it leads.

Finally, Roman philosopher, Seneca, considered that the worthiest use of time was
spending it on philosophy and in particular on itself; vis-à-vis considering time, its
properties and how to best use it. Whether or not I am abbreviating him with
absolute accuracy, this certainly provides further food for the psychedelic mind.

*[Note that, I am well aware that there will be a number of other factors in play which influence the
perceived passing of time, but I submit that in the long term the above is a prime driver.]

*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco*

Tobacco is the common name of several plants in the genus Nicotiana of the family Solanaceae, and the general term for any product prepared from the cured leaves of these plants. Seventy-nine species of tobacco are known, but the chief commercial crop is N. tabacum. The more potent variant N. rustica is also used in some countries.
Dried tobacco leaves are mainly used for smoking in cigarettes and cigars, as well as pipes and shishas. They can also be consumed as snuff, chewing tobacco, dipping tobacco, and snus.
Tobacco contains the highly addictive stimulant alkaloid nicotine as well as harmala alkaloids. Due to the widespread availability and legality of tobacco, nicotine is one of the most widely used recreational drugs. Tobacco use is a cause or risk factor for many deadly diseases, especially those affecting the heart, liver, and lungs, as well as many cancers. In 2008, the World Health Organization named tobacco use as the world's single greatest preventable cause of death.

## Etymology

The English word tobacco originates from the Spanish word tabaco. The precise origin of this word is disputed, but it is generally thought to have derived, at least in part, from Taíno, the Arawakan language of the Caribbean. In Taíno, it was said to mean either a roll of tobacco leaves (according to Bartolomé de las Casas, 1552), or to tabago, a kind of Y-shaped pipe used for sniffing tobacco smoke (according to Oviedo, with the leaves themselves being referred to as cohiba).
However, perhaps coincidentally, similar words in Spanish, Portuguese and Italian were used from 1410 for certain medicinal herbs. These probably derived from the Arabic طُبّاق ṭubbāq (also طُباق ṭubāq), a word reportedly dating to the ninth century, referring to various herbs.

## History

### Cultural significance

According to Haudenosaunee mythology, tobacco first grew out of Earth Woman's head after she died giving birth to her twin sons, Sapling and Flint.

### Traditional use

Tobacco has long been used in the Americas, with some cultivation sites in Mexico dating back to 1400–1000 BCE. Many Native American tribes traditionally grow and use tobacco. Historically, people from the Northeast Woodlands cultures have carried tobacco in pouches as a readily accepted trade item. It was smoked both socially and ceremonially, such as to seal a peace treaty or trade agreement. In some Native cultures, tobacco is seen as a gift from the Creator, with the ceremonial tobacco smoke carrying one's thoughts and prayers to the Creator.
Some Native Americans consider tobacco to be a medicine and advocate for its respectful usage, rather than a commercial one.

### Popularization

Following the arrival of the Europeans to the Americas, tobacco became increasingly popular as a trade item. In 1559, Francisco Hernández de Toledo, Spanish chronicler of the Indies, was the first European to bring tobacco seeds to the Old World, following orders of King Philip II of Spain. These seeds were planted in the outskirts of Toledo, more specifically in an area known as "Los Cigarrales" named after the continuous plagues of cicadas (cigarras in Spanish). Before the development of the lighter Virginia and white burley strains of tobacco, the smoke was too harsh to be inhaled. Small quantities were smoked at a time, using a pipe like the midwakh or kiseru, or newly invented waterpipes such as the bong or the hookah (see thuốc lào for a modern continuance of this practice). Tobacco became so popular that the English colony of Jamestown used it as currency and began exporting it as a cash crop; tobacco is often credited as being the export that saved Virginia from ruin. While a lucrative product, the growing expansion of tobacco demand was intimately tied to the history of slavery in the Caribbean.
The alleged benefits of tobacco also contributed to its success. The astronomer Thomas Harriot, who accompanied Sir Richard Grenville on his 1585 expedition to Roanoke Island, thought that the plant "openeth all the pores and passages of the body" so that the bodies of the natives "are notably preserved in health, and know not many grievous diseases, wherewithal we in England are often times afflicted."
Production of tobacco for smoking, chewing, and snuffing became a major industry in Europe and its colonies by 1700.
Tobacco has been a major cash crop in Cuba and in other parts of the Caribbean since the 18th century. Cuban cigars are world-famous.
Cigarettes became increasingly popular in the late 19th century when James Bonsack invented a machine to automate cigarette production. This increase in production allowed tremendous growth in the tobacco industry until the health revelations of the 20th century.

### Contemporary

Following the scientific revelations of the early-to-mid-20th century, tobacco was condemned as a health hazard and eventually became recognized as a cause of cancer, as well as other respiratory and circulatory diseases. In the United States, this led to the adoption of the 1998 Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement, which settled the many lawsuits by the U.S. states in exchange for a combination of yearly payments to the states and voluntary restrictions on advertising and marketing of tobacco products.
In the 1970s, Brown & Williamson crossbred tobacco to produce Y1, a strain containing an unusually high nicotine content, nearly doubling from 3.2–3.5% to 6.5%. In the 1990s, this prompted the Food and Drug Administration to allege that tobacco companies were intentionally manipulating the nicotine content of cigarettes.
The desire of many addicted smokers to quit has led to the development of tobacco cessation products.
In 2003, in response to growth of tobacco use in developing countries, the World Health Organization successfully rallied 168 countries to sign the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. The convention is designed to push for effective legislation and enforcement in all countries to reduce the harmful effects of tobacco. Between 2019 and 2021, concerns about increased COVID-19 health risks due to tobacco consumption facilitated smoking reduction and cessation.

## Biology

### Nicotiana

Many species of tobacco are in the genus of herbs Nicotiana. It is part of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) indigenous to North and South America, Australia, south west Africa, and the South Pacific.
Most nightshades contain varying amounts of nicotine, a powerful neurotoxin to insects. However, tobacco contains a much higher concentration of nicotine than the others. Unlike many other Solanaceae species, they do not contain tropane alkaloids, which are often poisonous to humans and other animals.
Despite containing enough nicotine and other compounds such as germacrene and anabasine and other piperidine alkaloids (varying between species) to deter most herbivores, a number of such animals have evolved the ability to feed on Nicotiana species without being harmed. Nonetheless, tobacco is unpalatable to many species due to its other attributes. For example, although the cabbage looper is a generalist pest, tobacco's gummosis and trichomes can harm early larvae survival. As a result, some tobacco plants (chiefly N. glauca) have become established as invasive weeds in some places.

### Types

The types of tobacco include:

Aromatic fire-cured is cured by smoke from open fires. In the United States, it is grown in northern middle Tennessee, central Kentucky, and Virginia. Fire-cured tobacco grown in Kentucky and Tennessee is used in some chewing tobaccos, moist snuff, some cigarettes, and as a condiment in pipe tobacco blends. Another fire-cured tobacco is Latakia, which is produced from oriental varieties of N. tabacum. The leaves are cured and smoked over smoldering fires of local hardwoods and aromatic shrubs in Cyprus and Syria.
Brightleaf tobacco is commonly known as "Virginia tobacco", often regardless of the state where it is planted. Prior to the American Civil War, most tobacco grown in the US was fire-cured dark-leaf. Sometime after the War of 1812, demand for a milder, lighter, more aromatic tobacco arose. Ohio, Pennsylvania and Maryland all innovated with milder varieties of the tobacco plant. Farmers discovered that brightleaf tobacco needs thin, starved soil, and those who could not grow other crops found that they could grow tobacco. Confederate soldiers traded it with each other and Union soldiers, and developed quite a taste for it. At the end of the war, the soldiers went home and a national market had developed for the local crop.
Broadleaf, a dark tobacco varietal family popular for producing enormous, resilient, and thick wrapper leaves.
Burley tobacco is an air-cured tobacco used predominantly in cigarette production, but also in pipe tobacco as a balance to Virginias and other leaves high in sugar content. In the U.S., burley tobacco plants are started from pelletized seeds placed in polystyrene trays floated on a bed of fertilized water in March or April.
Cavendish is more a process of curing and a method of cutting tobacco than a type, but is used to thicken flavors from other tobaccos that might lack a body. The processing and the cut are used to bring out the natural sweet taste in the tobacco. Cavendish can be produced from any tobacco type but is usually one of, or a blend of, Kentucky, Virginia and burley and is most commonly used for pipe tobacco.
Criollo tobacco is primarily used in the making of cigars. It was by most accounts one of the original Cuban tobaccos that emerged around the time of Columbus.
Dokha is a tobacco originally grown in Iran, mixed with leaves, bark and herbs for smoking in a midwakh.
Perique was developed in 1824 through the technique of pressure-fermentation of local tobacco by a farmer, Pierre Chenet. Considered the truffle of pipe tobaccos, it is used as a component in many blended pipe tobaccos but is too strong to be smoked pure. At one time the freshly moist Perique was also chewed, but it is no longer sold for this purpose. It is typically blended with pure Virginia to lend spice, strength and coolness to the blend.
Shade tobacco is cultivated in Connecticut and Massachusetts. Early Connecticut colonists acquired from the Native Americans the habit of smoking tobacco in pipes, and began cultivating the plant commercially, though the Puritans referred to it as the "evil weed". The Connecticut shade industry has weathered some major catastrophes, including a devastating hailstorm in 1929 and an epidemic of brown spot fungus in 2000, and is in danger of disappearing altogether, given the increase in the value of land.
Turkish tobacco is a sun-cured, highly aromatic, small-leafed variety (Nicotiana tabacum) grown in Turkey, Greece, Bulgaria and North Macedonia. Originally grown in regions historically part of the Ottoman Empire, it is also known as "oriental". Many of the early brands of cigarettes were made mostly or entirely of Turkish tobacco. Its main use evolved to be included in blends of pipe and especially cigarette tobacco. (A typical American cigarette is a blend of bright Virginia, burley and Turkish.)
White burley air-cured leaf was found to be milder than other types of tobacco. In 1865 George Webb of Brown County, Ohio, planted red burley seeds he had purchased and found a few of the seedlings had a whitish, sickly look, which became white burley.
Wild tobacco is native to the southwestern United States, Mexico and parts of South America. Its botanical name is Nicotiana rustica.

### Parasites

Tobacco, alongside its related products, can be infested by parasites such as Lasioderma serricorne (the tobacco beetle) and Ephestia elutella (the tobacco moth), which are the most widespread and damaging parasites to the tobacco industry. Infestation can range from the tobacco cultivated in the fields to the tobacco leaves used for manufacturing cigars, cigarillos, cigarettes, etc. Both the larvae of Lasioderma serricorne and caterpillars of Ephestia elutella are considered major pests.

## Production

### Cultivation

Tobacco is cultivated similarly to other agricultural products. Seeds were at first quickly scattered onto the soil. However, young plants came under increasing attack from flea beetles (Epitrix cucumeris or E. pubescens), which caused destruction of half the tobacco crops in United States in 1876. By 1890, successful experiments were conducted that placed the plant in a frame covered by thin cotton fabric. Modern tobacco seeds are sown in cold frames or hotbeds, as their germination is activated by light. In the United States, tobacco is often fertilized with the mineral apatite, which partially starves the plant of nitrogen, to produce a more desired flavor.
After the plants are about 8 inches (20 cm) tall, they are transplanted into the fields. Farmers used to have to wait for rainy weather to plant. A hole is created in the tilled earth with a tobacco peg, either a curved wooden tool or deer antler. After making two holes to the right and left, the planter would move forward two feet, select plants from his/her bag, and repeat. Various mechanical tobacco planters like Bemis, New Idea Setter, and New Holland Transplanter were invented in the late 19th and 20th centuries to automate the process: making the hole, watering it, guiding the plant in—all in one motion.
Tobacco is cultivated annually, and can be harvested in several ways. In the oldest method, still used, the entire plant is harvested at once by cutting off the stalk at the ground with a tobacco knife; it is then speared onto sticks, four to six plants a stick, and hung in a curing barn. In the 19th century, bright tobacco began to be harvested by pulling individual leaves off the stalk as they ripened. The leaves ripen from the ground upwards, so a field of tobacco harvested in this manner entails the serial harvest of a number of "primings", beginning with the volado leaves near the ground, working to the seco leaves in the middle of the plant, and finishing with the potent ligero leaves at the top. Before harvesting, the crop must be topped when the pink flowers develop. Topping always refers to the removal of the tobacco flower before the leaves are systematically harvested. As the industrial revolution took hold, the harvesting wagons which were used to transport leaves were equipped with man-powered stringers, an apparatus that used twine to attach leaves to a pole. In modern times, large fields are harvested mechanically, although topping the flower and in some cases the plucking of immature leaves is still done by hand.
In the U.S., North Carolina and Kentucky are the leaders in tobacco production, followed by Tennessee, Virginia, Georgia, South Carolina and Pennsylvania.

### Curing

Curing and subsequent aging allow for the slow oxidation and degradation of carotenoids in tobacco leaf. This produces certain compounds in the tobacco leaves and gives a sweet hay, tea, rose oil, or fruity aromatic flavor that contributes to the "smoothness" of the smoke. Starch is converted to sugar, which glycates protein, which is oxidized into advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs), a caramelization process that also adds flavor. Inhalation of these AGEs in tobacco smoke contributes to atherosclerosis and cancer. Levels of AGEs are dependent on the curing method used.
Tobacco can be cured through several methods, including:

Air-cured tobacco is hung in well-ventilated barns and allowed to dry over a period of four to eight weeks. Air-cured tobacco is low in sugar, which gives the tobacco smoke a light, mild flavor, and high in nicotine. Cigar and burley tobaccos are 'dark' air-cured.
Fire-cured tobacco is hung in large barns where fires of hardwoods are kept on continuous or intermittent low smoulder, and takes between three days and ten weeks, depending on the process and the tobacco. Fire curing produces a tobacco low in sugar and high in nicotine. Pipe tobacco, chewing tobacco, and snuff are fire-cured.
Flue-cured tobacco was originally strung onto tobacco sticks, which were hung from tier poles in curing barns (Aus: kilns, also traditionally called 'oasts'). These barns have flues run from externally fed fire boxes, heat-curing the tobacco without exposing it to smoke, slowly raising the temperature over the course of the curing. The process generally takes about a week. This method produces cigarette tobacco that is high in sugar and has medium to high levels of nicotine. Most cigarettes incorporate flue-cured tobacco, which produces a milder, more inhalable smoke. It is estimated that 1 tree is cut to flue-cure every 300 cigarettes, resulting in serious environmental consequences.
Sun-cured tobacco dries uncovered in the sun. This method is used in Turkey, Greece, and other Mediterranean countries to produce oriental tobacco. Sun-cured tobacco is low in sugar and nicotine and is used in cigarettes.
Some tobaccos go through a second stage of curing, known as fermenting or sweating. Cavendish undergoes fermentation pressed in a casing solution containing sugar and/or flavoring.

### Global production

#### Trends

Production of tobacco leaf increased by 40% between 1971, when 4.2 million tons of leaf were produced, and 1997, when 5.9 million tons of leaf were produced. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, tobacco leaf production was expected to hit 7.1 million tons by 2010. This number is a bit lower than the record-high production of 1992, when 7.5 million tons of leaf were produced. The production growth was almost entirely due to increased productivity by developing nations, where production increased by 128%. During that same time, production in developed countries actually decreased. China's increase in tobacco production was the single biggest factor in the increase in world production. China's share of the world market increased from 17% in 1971 to 47% in 1997. This growth can be partially explained by the existence of a low import tariff on foreign tobacco entering China. While this tariff was reduced from 66% in 1999 to 10% in 2004, it has still led to local Chinese cigarettes being preferred over foreign cigarettes because of their lower cost.

#### Major producers

Every year, about 5.9 million tons of tobacco are produced. Top producers are China (36.3%), India (12.9%), Brazil (11.9%) and Zimbabwe (3.5%).

#### China

Around the peak of global tobacco production, 20 million rural Chinese households were producing tobacco on 2.1 million hectares of land. While it is the major crop for millions of Chinese farmers, growing tobacco is not as profitable as cotton or sugarcane, because the Chinese government sets the market price. While this price is guaranteed, it is lower than the natural market price, because of the lack of market risk. To further control tobacco in their borders, China founded a State Tobacco Monopoly Administration (STMA) in 1982. The STMA controls tobacco production, marketing, imports, and exports, and contributes 12% to the nation's national income. As noted above, despite the income generated for the state by profits from state-owned tobacco companies and the taxes paid by companies and retailers, China's government has acted to reduce tobacco use.

#### India

India's Tobacco Board is headquartered in Guntur in the state of Andhra Pradesh. India has 96,865 registered tobacco farmers and many more who are not registered. In 2010, 3,120 tobacco product manufacturing facilities were operating in all of India. Around 0.25% of India's cultivated land is used for tobacco production.
Since 1947, the Indian government has supported growth in the tobacco industry. India has seven tobacco research centers, located in Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Punjab, Bihar, Mysore, and West Bengal which houses the core research institute.

#### Brazil

In Brazil, around 135,000 family farmers cite tobacco production as their main economic activity. Tobacco has never exceeded 0.7% of the country's total cultivated area. In the southern regions of Brazil, Virginia, and Amarelinho, flue-cured tobacco, as well as burley and Galpão Comum air-cured tobacco, are produced. These types of tobacco are used for cigarettes. In the northeast, darker, air- and sun-cured tobacco is grown. These types of tobacco are used for cigars, twists, and dark cigarettes. Brazil's government has made attempts to reduce the production of tobacco but has not had a successful systematic antitobacco farming initiative. Brazil's government, however, provides small loans for family farms, including those that grow tobacco, through the Programa Nacional de Fortalecimento da Agricultura Familiar.

#### Lebanon

Although only being the 35th biggest tobacco producer in 2023, the crop plays an important role in parts of Lebanon. The cultivation of tobacco in Lebanon dates back to the 17th century and today the crop is grown by all religious sects. In the southern parts of the country, the plant's resilience in difficult conditions—including the climate, the mountainous geography, and recurring wars—makes it an important source of income. The role of tobacco in the region is twofold. On the one hand, it is called the "crop of resistance" as it allows the population to navigate the consequences of a decades-long violent conflict and a certain degree of detachment, making it a symbol of hope, resistance, and resilience. On the other hand, the hard conditions of tobacco farming also made it the "bitter crop," as the farming is often times done by women and children without professional equipment. According to Munira Khayyat, tobacco production in the southern parts of Lebanon, like many other sectors where the state is absent (e.g. health care, employment, education), is overseen by Hezbollah and, though to a minor degree, also by AMAL.

### Problems in production

#### Child labor

The International Labour Office reported that the most child-laborers work in agriculture, which is one of the most hazardous types of work. The tobacco industry houses some of these working children. Use of children is widespread on farms in Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Malawi, and Zimbabwe. While some of these children work with their families on small, family-owned farms, others work on large plantations.
In late 2009, reports were released by the London-based human-rights group Plan International, claiming that child labor was common on Malawi (producer of 1.8% of the world's tobacco) tobacco farms. The organization interviewed 44 teens, who worked full-time on farms during the 2007–08 growing season. The child-laborers complained of low pay and long hours, as well as physical and sexual abuse by their supervisors. They also reported experiencing green tobacco sickness, a form of nicotine poisoning. When wet leaves are handled, nicotine from the leaves gets absorbed in the skin and causes nausea, vomiting, and dizziness. Children were exposed to levels of nicotine equivalent to smoking 50 cigarettes, just through direct contact with tobacco leaves. The effects of nicotine on human brain development in children can permanently alter brain structure and function.

#### Economy

Major tobacco companies have encouraged global tobacco production. Philip Morris, British American Tobacco, and Japan Tobacco each own or lease tobacco-manufacturing facilities in at least 50 countries and buy crude tobacco leaf from at least 12 more countries. This encouragement, along with government subsidies, has led to a glut in the tobacco market. This surplus has resulted in lower prices, which are devastating to small-scale tobacco farmers. According to the World Bank, between 1985 and 2000, the inflation-adjusted price of tobacco dropped 37%. Tobacco is the most widely smuggled legal product.

#### Environment

Tobacco production requires the use of large amounts of pesticides. Tobacco companies recommend up to 16 separate applications of pesticides just in the period between planting the seeds in greenhouses and transplanting the young plants to the field. Pesticide use has been worsened by the desire to produce larger crops in less time because of the decreasing market value of tobacco. Pesticides often harm tobacco farmers because they are unaware of the health effects and the proper safety protocol for working with pesticides. These pesticides, as well as fertilizers, end up in the soil, waterways, and the food chain. Coupled with child labor, pesticides pose an even greater threat. Early exposure to pesticides may increase a child's lifelong cancer risk, as well as harm their nervous and immune systems.
As with all crops, tobacco crops extract nutrients (such as phosphorus, nitrogen, and potassium) from soil, decreasing its fertility.
Furthermore, the wood used to cure tobacco in some places leads to deforestation. While some big tobacco producers such as China and the United States have access to petroleum, coal, and natural gas, which can be used as alternatives to wood, most developing countries still rely on wood in the curing process. Brazil alone uses the wood of 60 million trees per year for curing, packaging, and rolling cigarettes.
In 2017 WHO released a study on the environmental effects of tobacco.

### Research

Several tobacco plants have been used as model organisms in genetics. Tobacco BY-2 cells, derived from N. tabacum cultivar 'Bright Yellow-2', are among the most important research tools in plant cytology. Tobacco has played a pioneering role in callus culture research and the elucidation of the mechanism by which kinetin works, laying the groundwork for modern agricultural biotechnology. The first genetically modified plant was produced in 1982, using Agrobacterium tumefaciens to create an antibiotic-resistant tobacco plant. This research laid the groundwork for all genetically modified crops.

### Genetic modification

Because of its importance as a research tool, transgenic tobacco was the first genetically modified (GM) crop to be tested in field trials, in the United States and France in 1986; China became the first country in the world to approve commercial planting of a GM crop in 1993, which was tobacco.

#### Field trials

Many varieties of transgenic tobacco have been intensively tested in field trials. Agronomic traits such as resistance to pathogens (viruses, particularly to the tobacco mosaic virus (TMV); fungi; bacteria and nematodes); weed management via herbicide tolerance; resistance against insect pests; resistance to drought and cold; and production of useful products such as pharmaceuticals; and use of GM plants for bioremediation, have all been tested in over 400 field trials using tobacco.

#### Production

Currently, only the US is producing GM tobacco. The Chinese virus-resistant tobacco was withdrawn from the market in China in 1997. From 2002 to 2010, cigarettes made with GM tobacco with reduced nicotine content were available in the US under the market name Quest.

## Consumption

Tobacco is consumed in many forms and through a number of different methods. Some examples are:

### Enema

Tobacco smoke enemas were employed by the indigenous peoples of North America to stimulate respiration, injecting the smoke with a rectal tube. Later, in the 18th century, Europeans emulated the Americans. Tobacco resuscitation kits consisting of a pair of bellows and a tube were provided by the Royal Humane Society of London and placed at various points along the Thames.

### Nasal administration

Snuff is a ground smokeless tobacco product, inhaled or ‘snuffed’ through the nose. If referring specifically to the orally consumed moist snuff, see dipping tobacco.

### Smoked

Beedi (also known as bidis or biris) are thin, often flavoured cigarettes from India made of tobacco wrapped in a tendu leaf, and secured with coloured thread at one end.
Cigarettes are a product consumed through inhalation of smoke and manufactured from cured and finely cut tobacco leaves and reconstituted tobacco, often combined with other additives, then rolled into a paper cylinder.
Cigars are tightly rolled bundles of dried and fermented tobacco, which are ignited so their smoke may be drawn into the smokers' mouths.
Dokha is a middle eastern tobacco with high nicotine levels grown in parts of Oman and Hatta, which is smoked through a thin pipe called a medwakh. It is a form of tobacco which is dried up and ground and contains little to no additives excluding spices, fruits, or flowers to enhance smell and flavor.
Heat-not-burn products heat rather than burn tobacco to generate an aerosol that contains nicotine.
Hookah is a single- or multistemmed (often glass-based) water pipe for smoking. Hookahs were first used in India and Persia; the hookah has gained immense popularity, especially in the Middle East. A hookah operates by water filtration and indirect heat. It can be used for smoking herbal fruits or moassel, a mixture of tobacco, flavouring, and honey or glycerin.
Roll-your-own, often called 'rollies' or 'roll-ups', are relatively popular in some European countries. These are prepared from loose tobacco, cigarette papers, and filters all bought separately. They are usually cheaper to make.
Tobacco pipes typically consist of a small chamber (the bowl) for the combustion of the tobacco to be smoked and a thin stem (shank) that ends in a mouthpiece (the bit). Shredded pieces of tobacco are placed in the chamber and ignited.

### In the mouth

Tobacco used in the mouth (buccal (sublabial), sublingual):

Chewing tobacco is the oldest way of consuming tobacco leaves. It is consumed orally, in two forms: through sweetened strands ("chew" or "chaw"), or in a shredded form ("dip"). When consuming the long, sweetened strands, the tobacco is lightly chewed and compacted into a ball. When consuming the shredded tobacco, small amounts are placed inside the bottom lip, between the gum and the teeth, where it is gently compacted, thus it is often called dipping tobacco. Both methods stimulate the salivary glands, which led to the development of the spittoon.
Creamy snuff is tobacco paste, consisting of tobacco, clove oil, glycerin, spearmint, menthol, and camphor, and sold in a toothpaste tube. It is marketed mainly to women in India and is known by the brand names Ipco (made by Asha Industries), Denobac, Tona, and Ganesh. It is locally known as mishri in some parts of Maharashtra.
Dipping tobaccos are a form of smokeless tobacco. Dip is occasionally referred to as "chew", and because of this it is commonly confused with chewing tobacco, which encompasses a wider range of products. A small clump of dip is 'pinched' out of the tin and placed between the lower or upper lip and gums. Some brands, as with snus, are portioned in small, porous pouches for less mess.
Gutka is a preparation of crushed betel nut, tobacco, and sweet or savory flavorings. It is manufactured in India and exported to a few other countries. A mild stimulant, it is sold across India in small, individual-sized packets.
Kreteks are cigarettes made with a complex blend of tobacco, cloves, and a flavoring "sauce". They were first introduced in the 1880s in Kudus, Java, to deliver the medicinal eugenol of cloves to the lungs.
Pituri, a nicotine-containing substance traditionally made from Australian tobacco plants, used by Indigenous Australians for chewing and placed between the lower or upper lip and gums.
Snus is a steam-pasteurized moist powdered tobacco product that is not fermented and induces minimal salivation. It is consumed by placing it (loose or in little pouches) against the upper gums for an extended period of time. It is somewhat similar to dipping tobacco but does not require spitting and is significantly lower in TSNAs.
Tobacco chewing gum A gum containing nicotine or tobacco designed to be chewed.
Tobacco edibles, often in the form of an infusion or a spice, have gained popularity in recent years.
Tobacco water is a traditional organic insecticide used in domestic gardening. Tobacco dust can be used similarly. It is produced by boiling strong tobacco in water, or by steeping the tobacco in water for a longer period. When cooled, the mixture can be applied as a spray, or painted onto the leaves of garden plants, where it kills insects. Tobacco is, however, banned from use as a pesticide in certified organic production by the USDA's National Organic Program.

### Topical

Topical tobacco paste is sometimes used as a treatment for wasp, hornet, fire ant, scorpion, and bee stings. An amount equivalent to the contents of a cigarette is mashed in a cup with about a half a teaspoon of water to make a paste that is then applied to the affected area.

## Influence

### Social

Smoking in public was, for a long time, reserved for men, and smoking by women was sometimes associated with promiscuity; in Japan, during the Edo period, prostitutes and their clients often approached one another under the guise of offering a smoke. The same was true in 19th-century Europe.
Following the American Civil War, the use of tobacco, primarily in cigars, became associated with masculinity and power. Modern tobacco use has often been stigmatized; this has spawned quitting associations and antismoking campaigns. Bhutan is the only country in the world where tobacco sales are illegal. Due to its propensity for causing detumescence and erectile dysfunction, some studies have described tobacco as an anaphrodisiacal substance.

### Religion

#### Christianity

In Christian denominations of the conservative holiness movement, such as the Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Connection and Evangelical Wesleyan Church, the use of tobacco and other drugs is prohibited; ¶42 of the 2014 Book of Discipline of the Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Connection states:

In the judgment of The Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Connection (Original Allegheny Conference), the use of tobacco is a great evil, unbecoming a Christian, a waste of the Lord's money, and a defilement of the body, which should be the temple of the Holy Ghost. We do, therefore, most earnestly require our members to refrain from its cultivation, manufacture, and sale, and to abstain from its use in all forms, for Jesus' sake. We will not receive as members into our churches nor will we ordain or license to preach or to exhort, persons who use, cultivate, manufacture, or sell tobacco. Using tobacco by a member of a church or of the Conference after being received from this date (June 28, 1927) is a violation of the law of the church, and the offending party should be dealt with according to the judiciary rules.
Members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (popularly known as Mormons) adhere to the Word of Wisdom, a religious health code that is interpreted as prohibiting the consumption of tobacco as well as alcohol, coffee, and tea.

#### Islam

Most Islamic scholars have condemned tobacco due to its harmful effects on health. The earliest fatwa (religious opinion) against tobacco use dates from 1602. Most major Islamic sects prohibit its use. While tobacco is not mentioned in the Quran, the Quran does instruct Muslims to live healthy lives.

#### Sikhism

Sikhism, a Dharmic religion from India, considers tobacco consumption as a taboo and very bad for health and spirituality. Initiated Sikhs are never to consume tobacco in any form.

### Demographic

Research on tobacco use is limited mainly to smoking, which has been studied more extensively than any other form of consumption. An estimated 1.1 billion people, and up to one-third of the adult population, use tobacco in some form. Smoking is more prevalent among men (however, the gender gap declines with age), the poor, and in transitional or developing countries. A study published in Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report found that in 2019 approximately one in four youths (23.0%) in the U.S. had used a tobacco product during the past 30 days. This represented approximately three in 10 high school students (31.2%) and approximately one in eight middle school students (12.5%).
Rates of smoking continue to rise in developing countries, but have leveled off or declined in developed countries. Smoking rates in the United States have dropped by half from 1965 to 2006, falling from 42% to 20.8% in adults. In the developing world, tobacco consumption is rising by 3.4% per year.

### Health effects

According to the World Health Organization, tobacco kills more than 8 million people every year worldwide, including about 1.3 million non-smokers exposed to secondhand smoke.

#### Chemicals

Tobacco smoking harms health because of the toxic chemicals in tobacco smoke, including carbon monoxide, cyanide, and carcinogens, which have been proven to cause heart and lung diseases and cancer.
Thousands of different substances in cigarette smoke, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (such as benzopyrene), formaldehyde, cadmium, nickel, arsenic, tobacco-specific nitrosamines, and phenols contribute to the harmful effects of smoking.
According to the World Health Organization, tobacco is the single greatest cause of preventable death globally. WHO estimates that tobacco caused 5.4 million deaths in 2004 and 100 million deaths over the course of the 20th century. Similarly, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention describe tobacco use as "the single most important preventable risk to human health in developed countries and an important cause of premature death worldwide." Due to these health consequences, it is estimated that a 10 hectare (approximately 24.7 acre) field of tobacco used for cigarettes causes 30 deaths per year – 10 from lung cancer and 20 from cigarette-induced diseases like cardiac arrest, gangrene, bladder cancer, mouth cancer, etc.
The harms caused by inhaling tobacco smoke include diseases of the heart and lungs, with smoking being a major risk factor for heart attacks, strokes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (emphysema), and cancer (particularly cancers of the lungs, larynx, mouth, and pancreas). Cancer is caused by inhaling carcinogenic substances in tobacco smoke.
Inhaling secondhand tobacco smoke (which has been exhaled by a smoker) can cause lung cancer in nonsmoking adults. In the United States, about 3,000 adults die each year due to lung cancer from secondhand smoke exposure. Heart disease caused by secondhand smoke kills around 46,000 nonsmokers every year.
In children, exposure to secondhand tobacco smoke is associated with a higher incidence and severity of respiratory illnesses, middle ear disease, and asthma attacks. Each year in the United States, secondhand smoke exposure causes 24,500 infants to be born with low birth weight, 71,900 preterm births, 202,300 episodes of asthma, and 790,000 health care visits for ear infections.
The addictive alkaloid nicotine is a stimulant, and popularly known as the most characteristic constituent of tobacco. In drug effect preference questionnaires, a rough indicator of addictive potential, nicotine scores almost as highly as opioids. Users typically develop tolerance and dependence. Nicotine is known to produce conditioned place preference, a sign of psychological enforcement value. In one medical study, tobacco's overall harm to user and self was determined at three percent below cocaine, and 13 percent above amphetamines, ranking sixth most harmful of the 20 drugs assessed.
Tobacco also contains 2,3,6-Trimethyl-1,4-naphthoquinone (sometimes called 2,3,6-TQ and TMN) which is a reversible monoamine oxidase inhibitor of type A and B with a binding affinity somewhat similar to that of clorgyline and deprenyl. It is a stronger dopamine releasing agent than nicotine and inhibits dopamine metabolism from its MAOI activity. Tobacco also contains Harmine and Norharmine which is a reversible MAO-A inhibitor. The MAO-A activity of tobacco alkaloids have been thought to play a role in the addictive qualities of tobacco.

#### Radioactivity

Polonium-210 is a radioactive trace contaminant of tobacco, providing additional explanation for the link between smoking and bronchial cancer.
The radioactive particles build up over time in the lungs and a UCLA study has estimated that the radiation from 25 years of smoking would cause over 120 deaths per thousand smokers.

### Economic

Tobacco makes a significant economic contribution. The global tobacco market in 2010 was estimated at US\$760 billion, excluding China. The global revenues from tobacco taxes in 2013–2014 was approximately \$269 billion.
In China, cigarette manufacturing is one of the few profitable state-owned industries. For example, in 1998 the 1,429 state-owned enterprises in Yunnan province had revenue of Renminbi (RMB) 69.1 billion (US\$8.3 billion) while eight cigarette manufacturing plants alone accounted for about 53 percent (or RMB 36.2 billion) of total provincial industry sales. The Chinese government also collects tax on tobacco products. Tax revenues from cigarettes increased from 740 to 842 billion Chinese yuan between 2014 and 2016. This generated an additional 101 billion Chinese yuan in tax revenues for the government.
In India, tobacco generates approximately 20 billion Indian rupees (US\$0.45 billion) of income per annum as a result of employment, income and government revenue.
Statistica estimates that in the U.S. alone, the tobacco industry has a market of US\$121 billion, despite the fact the CDC reports that US smoking rates are declining steadily. In terms of health expenditures, cigarette smoking contributed to more than \$225 billion (or 11.7%) of annual healthcare spending in the U.S. in 2014. Smoking-attributable healthcare spending increased more than 30% for Medicaid between 2010 and 2014.
In the US, the decline in the number of smokers, the end of the Tobacco Transition Payment Program in 2014, and competition from growers in other countries, made tobacco farming economics more challenging.
Of the 1.22 billion smokers worldwide, 1 billion of them live in developing or transitional economies, and much of the disease burden and premature mortality attributable to tobacco use disproportionately affect the poor. While smoking prevalence has declined in many developed countries, it remains high in others, and is increasing among women and in developing countries. Between one-fifth and two-thirds of men in most populations smoke. Women's smoking rates vary more widely but rarely equal male rates.
Tobacco users must also spend a significant amount of money on cigarettes to maintain regular use, as tobacco products are often heavily taxed by governments. For example, a pack a day smoker in the state of New York would have to spend around \$4,690.25 a year on cigarettes alone.
In Indonesia, the lowest income group spends 15% of its total expenditures on tobacco. In Egypt, more than 10% of low-income household expenditure is on tobacco. The poorest 20% of households in Mexico spend 11% of their income on tobacco.

### Advertising

The tobacco industry advertises its products through a variety of media, including sponsorship, particularly of sporting events. Because of the health risks of these products, this is now one of the most highly regulated forms of marketing. Some or all forms of tobacco advertising are banned in many countries.
