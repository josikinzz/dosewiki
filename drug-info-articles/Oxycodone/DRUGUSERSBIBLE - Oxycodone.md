## Subjective Experience

Oxycodone is an opioid medication which is prescribed to treat moderate to severe
pain, and is available in both instant and extended release forms. It was first
synthesized in Germany in 1916, and was first used clinically in 1917.

As would be expected, it comes with a variety of potential side effects, and clear risks
with respect to overdose and addiction. Indeed, according to the CDC (the US
Government's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), among drug overdose
deaths that mentioned at least one specific drug it ranked #1 in 2011. The message
here is extremely clear.

This is certainly one which I will be treading carefully with. Also note that it is not a
drug to mix with alcohol, or in fact, other medicines. In addition, grapefruit is
commonly cited as a potentiator, and should be avoided.

As a street drug it is sometimes referred to as hillbilly heroin, due to its abuse in the
Appalachian region of the US and its cultural reputation as a poor man's heroin.

My supply comprises a single 40mg pill, which is actually quite alarming, as even a
cursory check reveals this to be a dangerous dose for non-tolerant users. I note also
that it is marked “prolonged release” and is thus of the extended release variety.

The vendor was helpful enough to explain that I could snort this if I wanted to. All I
had to do was remove the wax coating and crush the contents. Given the significantly
increased dose sensitivity of this drug when insufflated this isn’t a route I will be
taking.

So what should I take? Looking at the generic threshold figures, and taking into
account my own physiology, my non-tolerant status, and my lack of enthusiasm for
opioids generally, I decide to pitch in at no more than 10mg.

For more precision, rather than simply cutting the 40mg pill into four approximate
quarters, I use my scales. I weigh the entire pill (148mg) and then cut it into four. I
then weigh each quarter and select one which is just under the requisite weight
(36mg). Note that, as much as I can, I also make sure that the wax coating is
distributed evenly across the four quarters. Overall I am confident that my dose, if
anything, is a tad under the 10mg maximum.

The left-over debris is a combination of white crusty powder and yellow coating. It
may seem a shame, but I bin it as an obvious safety precaution.

One thought that occurs before starting is that this operation may have neutralized
the extended release mechanism of the pill. Regardless, I am now ready to go.

```
T+0:00 I spoon approx 10mg of oxycodone (the 36mg quarter) into my mouth
and swill it down with a glass of water [2:10pm]
```
```
T+0:30 A mellow-headedness is starting to emerge and I am warmer. I feel
less anxious and slightly more relaxed than I was.
```
```
T+1:00 This hasn’t evolved very far. It remains a gentle bubble of warm
tranquillity, which is pleasant but not euphoric. I’m not complaining: it’s a
nice enough vibe with an undeniable uplift and it isn’t too strong. It also
carries a gentle touch of numbness.
```
```
T+2:00 I am still floating along quite nicely with no flip side so far.
```
```
T+3:30 The intensity is now lower than it was earlier, although I remain in a
very comfortable zone. Even though I feel that having more would tip me over
into nausea and illness, I do have a worrying sense that I would redose had I
not binned the remainder of my supply.
```
```
T+6:00 As with some of the other opioids I have experienced, as I tire I still
feel slightly dizzy and a little queasy. This is not particularly heavy on this
occasion, but it comes and goes, and is noticeable.
```
I retired to bed at 10pm (T+8:00), exhausted and feeling down about everything in
sight, which was no doubt part of the come-down. The night’s sleep, however, wasn’t
so bad, despite a couple of wake-ups in need of water.

I believe that I just about got away with this one. I have made some bad decisions
with opioids, usually overdoing it, but here I found a dose which delivered a good few
hours of pleasantness with a payback which was apparent but manageable.

Finally, the warnings with respect to oxycodone are particularly stark and I was wise
to heed them. If you do intend to use this, I would urge you to do the same. The
statistics I referred to earlier tell their own tale.
