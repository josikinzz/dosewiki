DESCRIPTION #
 
General Effects Notes
 The effects of MET have been compared to DMT ("beginner DMT" and "like a combo of DMT & Salvia" both reported on Bluelight). One report on Bluelight describes effects increased and lengthened from co-ingestion with an MAOI.
 
EXPERIENCE EXCERPTS #
 
[25 mg vaporized followed by 15 mg vaporized] "[...] This is a sort of slightly speedy tryptamine, slightly LSD-like state with a warm MDMA-ish center. [...]" -- [Exp 90320](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=90320)
 
[15 mg vaporized] "[...] The come up was about 2-3 times as slow as the come up on DMT. It was strangely reminiscent of something, which I eventually realized was the come-down from DMT. This 'I'm not in the crazy fractalizing weirdness any more but I still feel pretty damn odd' feeling came first, but was almost immediately accompanied by a deeply satisfying feeling of body warmth and comfort. [...]" -- [Exp 89318](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=89318)

**N-Ethyl-N-methyltryptamine** (also known as **Methylethyltryptamine** , and **MET** ) is a lesser-known novel [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) substance of the [tryptamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tryptamine) class that produces powerful and short-lived [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) effects when [administered](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Routes_of_administration) . It is structurally related to [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT) and is similarly unique among [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) due to its short-lived effects, rapid onset and progressive stages.

The fumarate salt has been reported as being active via smoking/vaporization at 15-65 mg and orally at 80-110 mg. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] When smoked or vaporized it has been reported to produce effects similar to those of [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT) with some distinct stylistic variations which include a more grounded headspace, stimulating physical effects, and reduced subjective intensity.

Very little data exists about the pharmacological properties, metabolism, and toxicity of MET, and it has a very brief history of human usage. Today, it is either used [recreationally](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Recreational_drug_use) or as an [entheogenic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entheogenic) substance and has been exclusively distributed by online [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) vendors since mid-2016. Due to its unstudied properties and effects, it is highly advised to approach this novel [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) substance with the proper precautions and [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Harm_reduction_practices) if choosing to use it.

## Chemistry

MET, or N-ethyl-N-methyltryptamine, is a synthetic indole molecule of the tryptamine class. Tryptamines share a core structure that comprises a bicyclic indole heterocycle attached at R 3 to an amino group via an ethyl side chain. Unlike DMT, which contains two methyl groups, MET contains groups of one methyl and one ethyl carbon chains bound to the terminal amine R N of its tryptamine backbone.

## Pharmacology

As with most [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) tryptamines, MET is thought to act principally as a [5-HT2A](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin#The_5-HT_system) [partial agonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist#Agonists) . The psychedelic effects are believed to come from MET's binding efficacy at the 5-HT 2A receptors. However, the role of these interactions and how they result in the psychedelic experience continue to remain elusive.

There is very little information on the human pharmacology or toxicity of MET. The freebase is believed to be active via vaporization at 15 mg and orally at 80-100 mg.

## Subjective effects

This compound has very similar effects to that of [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT) when smoked or vaporized. Its visual effects, such as [geometry](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Geometry) and [internal hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucinations) , are almost identical with the exception of being slightly brighter and synthetic in their overall appearance. The head space, however, has been reported to be considerably more stimulating, grounded, and less jarring than the head space of [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT) , which has led some to describe it as a more recreational variant of DMT. In contrast to [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT) , it also produces a noticeably pleasurable body high that is similar to that of [5-MeO-DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/5-MeO-DMT) although not as intensely nauseating or overwhelming.

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)**
- **[Spontaneous physical sensations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_physical_sensations)** 
- **[Physical euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria)** - This compound has been reported to be intensely euphoric in a manner which results from its powerful tactile enhancement alongside the production of pleasurable sensations across the body. It has been compared to the physically euphoric effects of [5-MeO-DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/5-MeO-DMT) although less encompassing or overwhelming.
- **[Tactile enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_enhancement)**

#### Geometry
 
The visual geometry produced by this compound can be described as somewhat similar in appearance to that of [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT) , [4-HO-MET](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-HO-MET) and [DET](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DET) . It can be comprehensively described through its variations as intricate in complexity, abstract in form, equally synthetic and organic in style, structured in organization, extremely brightly lit and multicoloured in scheme, glossy in shading, equally sharp and soft in its edges, large in size, fast in speed, smooth in motion, equally rounded and angular in its corners, non-immersive in depth and consistent in intensity. The visuals have a contradictory natural and synthetic feel to them which is reminiscent of both [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) and [psilocybin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocybin) .

- It should be noted that these effects are the rarest and least reproducible those that can occur during a [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) experience. They are considered unique in that that simply taking more of the substance does not necessarily increase the chance they will occur, and are said to rely more on contextual factors such as the user's [set and setting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Set_and_setting) rather than the substance or dose itself. Their fullest manifestations are sometimes called "peak", "transcendent" or "transformative" experiences; however, they can still occur on a conceptual or cognitive level that can leave a lasting positive impact on the user.

## Toxicity and harm potential

The toxicity and long-term health effects of recreational MET use do not seem to have been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dose is unknown. This is because MET is a [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) with very little history of human usage. Anecdotal evidence from people within the community who have tried MET suggest that there are no negative health effects attributed to simply trying the substance by itself at low to moderate doses and using it very sparingly (but nothing can be completely guaranteed). [Independent research](https://www.google.com/) should always be done to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe before consumption.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this substance.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

Early reports suggest MET is not habit-forming and the desire to use it can actually decrease with regular consumption. Like with most [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) it is most widely thought to be self-regulating.

As with DMT, tolerance to the effects of MET does not readily occur, though its extended residual effects indicate a mild form of tolerance may be present when used in quick succession. However, it presents little to no cross-tolerance with other psychedelics, meaning that after the consumption of MET psychedelics will not display a reduced effect.

## Legal status

Due to its relative obscurity, the possession and sale of MET is unscheduled in most countries.

- **Germany** : MET is controlled under the NpSG ( *New Psychoactive Substances Act* ) as of July 18, 2019. Production and import with the aim to place it on the market, administration to another person and trading is punishable. Possession is illegal but not penalized.
- **Japan** : MET is a controlled substance in Japan as of March 20, 2023.
- **New Zealand** : MET is an analogue of DMT, so is a Class C controlled substance in New Zealand.
- **Switzerland** : MET is not controlled under Buchstabe A, B, C and D. It could be considered legal.
- **United Kingdom** : MET is a Class A controlled substance in the UK under a generic clause originally added in 1977 that covers derivatives of tryptamine that are modified by alkyl substitution at the nitrogen atom of the tryptamine side chain.
- **United States** : MET is unscheduled in the United States. However, it is likely that it would be considered a controlled substance analogue of DMT or DET, in which case, sales for human consumption or possession with the intent to ingest could be prosecuted under the Federal Analogue Act.

  "wikipedia": `# Methylethyltryptamine
*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylethyltryptamine*

Methylethyltryptamine (MET), also known as N-methyl-N-ethyltryptamine (N,N-MET), is a psychedelic drug of the tryptamine family. It is taken orally or via inhalation.
The drug acts as an agonist of the serotonin 5-HT2 receptors and to a lesser extent as a serotonin releasing agent. It is closely related to dimethyltryptamine (DMT) and to diethyltryptamine (DET).
MET appears to have been first described in the literature in 1981. It was only briefly mentioned in Alexander Shulgin's 1997 book TiHKAL (Tryptamines I Have Known and Loved). The drug was encountered as a novel designer drug in Europe in 2014.

## Use and effects

MET was briefly mentioned in Alexander Shulgin's TiHKAL (Tryptamines I Have Known and Loved) and other publications, where he has stated it to be orally active as a psychedelic at doses of 80 to 100 mg. Its duration, onset, and peak were not provided. The free base of MET has been reported to be active as a psychedelic via vaporization at a dose of 15 mg per informal anecdotal reports. Very little information is available on the effects of MET. However, its effects have been reported to include hallucinations, euphoria, tactile enhancement, cognitive effects, pupil dilation, muscle cramps, teeth grinding, and increased heart rate and blood pressure.

## Interactions

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

MET is a serotonin 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptor partial agonist. It shows very weak activity as an agonist of the serotonin 5-HT1A and 5-HT2B receptors. In addition to acting at the serotonin 5-HT2 receptors, MET is a serotonin releasing agent with lower potency. It produces the head-twitch response, a behavioral proxy of psychedelic effects, in animals.

## Chemistry

MET, also known as N-methyl-N-ethyltryptamine, is a substituted tryptamine derivative. It is closely related to N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) and to other N,N-dialkylated tryptamines.

### Analogues

Analogues of MET besides DMT include DET, DPT, DiPT, DBT, MiPT, MBT, EPT, EiPT, and PiPT, among others. Derivatives of MET include 4-HO-MET, 5-MeO-MET, bretisilocin (5-fluoro-MET; GM-2505), and 7-F-5-MeO-MET, among others.

## History

MET appears to have first been described in the literature by 1981. It was specifically mentioned in Michael Valentine Smith's Psychedelic Chemistry. Subsequently, MET was briefly described in Alexander Shulgin's TiHKAL (Tryptamines I Have Known and Loved) in 1997. MET was encountered as a novel designer drug in Europe in 2014.
