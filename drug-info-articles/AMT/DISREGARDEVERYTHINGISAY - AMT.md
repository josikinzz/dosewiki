**AMT** (**a-Methyltryptamine**) is a psychedelic, stimulant, and entactogen drug of the tryptamine class. It was originally developed in Russia as an antidepressant in1963. Similar in mechanism to LSD and Mushrooms, AMT acts as a non-selective serotonin receptor agonist but also acts as relatively balanced releasing agent of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine. Alongside this, it been shown to be a very weak, non-selective, and reversible inhibitor of the enzyme monoamine oxidase (MAOI), similar to harmine. MAOI is an enzyme that degrades amine neurotransmitters, such as dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin. AMT therefore increases the amount of these neurotransmitters in the brain.

The mechanism that produces the psychedelic effects of AMT is a direct result from its action as a 5-HT2A serotonin receptor agonist in the brain (a mechanism of action shared by all other hallucinogenic tryptamines and phenethylamines).

It is because of this that AMT cannot be safely used in combination with antidepressants, painkillers, stimulants, SSRIs, MDMA, dextromethorphan, and a number of other drugs as certain combinations can cause deadly reactions.

The AMT experience contains a complex and wide array of effects which based on the predefined potential subjective effects index found [here](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effects_index), I will now begin to breakdown and describe.

**Physical Effects:**

The physical effects of AMT can be broken down into five components all of which progressively intensify proportional to dosage. These are described below and generally include:

- **Spontaneous tactile sensations** - AMT’s body high can be described as an intense and constant all-encompassing sensation. In comparison to other psychedelics, this sensation does not manifest itself in the form of a continuously shifting tingling sensation that travels up and down the body spontaneously, instead being felt as an extended unchanging activation of every nerve ending on the body that lasts throughout the entire duration of the trip. This everlasting droning is immensely pleasurable but can become overwhelmingly intense and almost a burden at higher levels
- **Stimulation** - In terms of its effects on the physical energy levels of the tripper, AMT is very stimulating, resulting in jaw clenching and a shakiness and unsteadiness of the hands but encouraging trippers to move around, run, dance, climb and generally engage in physical activities. In comparison, other more commonly used psychedelics such as psilocybin are generally sedating and relaxed.
- **Nausea** - In terms of the physical discomfort experienced on this substance, moderate to extreme nausea is almost consistently reported when consumed at any dosage. This either passes once the tripper has vomited or gradually fades by itself as the peak sets in.
- **Difficulty urinating** - A slight difficulty urinating is occasionally present.
- **Headaches** - Many people report headaches towards the end of the experience
- **Loss of temperature regulation**

**Cognitive Effects:**

In comparison to more traditional psychedelics such as LSD, DMT and Psilocin, the AMT head space is described as not nearly as deep, insightful or profound.

The total sum of these cognitive components regardless of the setting generally includes:

- **Introspection** - This component is consistently manifested only in the context of a non social setting in which the user is alone.
- **Acceleration of thought**
- **Connectivity of thought**
- **Increased empathy, love and sociability**
- **Enhancement of current mind state**
- **Euphoria**
- **Conceptual thinking**
- **Ego suppression, loss and death**
- **Time distortion**
- **Increased empathy, love and sociability** - This component is consistently manifested only in the context of social settings in which one is within the company of others. These feelings of sociability, love and empathy are a little weaker and less sharp than those found on substances such as MDMA and 2C-B but still prove strong enough to provide long lasting therapeutic effects.

**Visual Effects:**

*Enhancements*

AMT presents a full and complete array of possible visual enhancements which generally include:

- **Increased visual acuity**
- **Enhancement of colours**
- **Enhanced pattern recognition**

*Distortions*

As for visual distortions and alterations, the effects experienced are detailed below:

- **Visual drifting** (*melting, flowing, breathing and morphing*) - In comparison to other psychedelics, this effect can be described as highly detailed, slow and smooth in motion, static in their appearance, and unrealistic/cartoon like in style.
- **Tracers**
- **After images**
- **Texture repetition** - In comparison to more commonly used psychedelics such as LSD and Psilocybin, this effect is significantly less intricate and complex although still very distinct in its presence.
- **Colour shifting**
- **Scenery slicing**

*Geometry*

The visual geometry that is present throughout this trip can be described as more similar in appearance to that of psilocin and 2C-E than LSD. At lower levels, they appear to be bland and simplistic but become equal in terms of intricacy and depth to that of any of the classical psychedelics. They can be comprehensively described as structured in their organization, organic in geometric style, intricate in complexity, large in size, fast and smooth in motion, colourful in scheme, glossy in colour, blurred in their edges and rounded in their corners. They have a “natural” feel to them and at higher dosages are significantly more likely to result in states of Level 7B visual geometry over Level 7A.

*Hallucinatory States*

At high dosages AMT can produce a full range of high level hallucinatory states in a fashion that is more consistent and reproducible than that of many other commonly used psychedelic. These effects include:

- **External hallucinations**
- **Internal hallucinations** - This particular effect commonly contains hallucinations with scenarios, settings, concepts and autonomous entity contact. They are more common within dark environments and can be described as internal in their manifestation, lucid in believability, interactive in style and almost exclusively of religious, spiritual, mystical or a transcendental nature in their overall theme.

**Auditory Effects:**

The auditory effects of AMT are common in their occurrence and exhibit a full range of effects which commonly include:

- **enhancements**
- **distortions**
- **hallucinations**

**Smoking vs Oral Ingestion:**

One of the practical things about AMT is that there are two methods of consumption that result in two alternate trips which differ in terms of their duration, body high, and visuals. If smoked, AMT has a quicker onset and a much shorter duration that is far less likely to keep tripper’s up all night and completely unable to sleep. It is also devoid of the nauseating effects found with oral ingestion, but is less visually intense while more physically stimulating. If you are going to try and smoke AMT, it is essential that it is purchased in freebase and not salt form.

**Health Effects, Potential Addiction, and Tolerance:**

The toxicity and long term health effects of recreational AMT use do not seem to have been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dosage is unknown. Anecdotal evidence from people who have tried AMT within the psychedelic community suggest that there are no negative health effects attributed to simply trying this drug at low to moderate doses or using it very sparingly but nothing can be completely guaranteed.

In rats, the median lethal dose or dosage at which 50% of participants die (LD50) of AMT for mice when administered orally is 22 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) and in mice it is 38 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg). This means that for a 60-kilogram (130 lb) human to reach the LD50 value of rats they would have to take 1320 mg or 2280 mg to reach the LD50 of mice. This is between 44 and 76 times the active dosage of 30 mg.

AMT is non-habit-forming and the desire to use it can actually decrease with use. They are most often self-regulating so addiction to this substance is essentially unheard of. It can be prevented by manually limiting your usage of the drug.

There is an immediate tolerance to AMT after ingestion, preventing you from experiencing its full effects more often than every 4-7 days (unless you increase your dose significantly). This also produces a cross tolerance between AMT and LSD, psilocin and various other tryptamine psychedelics.

MAOIs have highly dangerous interactions when combined with almost any antidepressant (particularly SSRIs such as Prozac) or stimulants (such as MDMA and amphetamines), common migraine medications, certain herbs (such as St John’s Wort), or even most cold medicines (including decongestants, antihistamines, and cough syrup) as it can cause serotonin syndrome or hypertensive crisis. In short, do not mix this drug with anything other than the classic psychedelic tryptamines like LSD and mushrooms unless you have done your research and are absolutely sure it isn’t going to kill you or cause serotonin syndrome. 

**Legal Issues:**

- As of April 4, 2003 AMT is classed as a schedule I substance in the Controlled Substances Act of the United States.
- It is legal in the United Kingdom, however, and does not fall under the tryptamine clause, as its substituent is not on the nitrogen position. See “2001 Misuse of Drugs Act: Schedule 1, Regulation 3” for more information.
- The 5-Methoxy cousin, 5-MeO-AMT, is schedule 9 in Australia and AMT would be controlled as an analogue of this.
- Similarly, Canada has no mention of this substance in the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act.

If you want to try this substance, it is extremely cheap and easy to obtain with a quick google search of the term “buy amt” resulting in the first page becoming full of links to legitimate vendors. For those who are lucky enough to have a local head shop in their town, many of us can simply buy this substance in the form of perfectly legal, prepackaged, over the counter pills and skip the delivery process all together.

**Conclusion:**

Although this drug may not be as visually intricate or transcendental as more commonly used psychedelics, this is a substance that still holds its place in the psychedelic world.
