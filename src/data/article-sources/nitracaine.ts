Nitracaine is a synthetic compound classified as a local anesthetic with stimulant properties. It falls into the class of drugs known as local anesthetics, and it is chemically related to cocaine. Nitracaine shares some similarities in effects with cocaine but has its own distinct pharmacological profile. The chemical structure of nitracaine consists of a benzoic acid ester with a para-substituted phenyl ring. It is formally known as 3-(diethylamino)-2,2-dimethylpropyl 4-nitrobenzoate. The presence of the nitro group (NO2) in its molecular structure contributes to its anesthetic properties.

It is closely related to dimethocaine.

## Legal status

Sweden's public health agency suggested classifying Nitracaine as a hazardous substance, on September 25, 2019.
