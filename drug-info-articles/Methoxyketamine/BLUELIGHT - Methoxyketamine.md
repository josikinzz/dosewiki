***Note that the correct full name is 2-MeO-Deschloroketamine*** Also called 2-MeO-Ketamine

I have heared that the ketamine derivate 2-MeO-Ketamine (i.e. ketamine with the 2-chlorine group replaced by a 2-MeO-group, or more precisely, according to IUPAC, 2-(2-methoxyphenyl)-2-(methylamino)cyclohexanone) may have interesting properties. anyone knows something about it?

I just noticed that there is already a thread about it in the "other drugs" section: [http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/594752-2-MeO-Ketamine](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/594752-2-MeO-Ketamine)


but there is not much info yet either.

"Interesting properties" my ass, it's just a closer knock off of K than MXE that vendors can sell

[There was a thread that discussed this](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/504286-PCP-analogs-%28Cumulative%29) and poster claims:

For all intents and purposes, treat this like ketamine. MeO-K has a MW of 233, ketamine has a MW of 237. So it's got a relative potency of 1.017x with no corrections for the group substitutuion.

An excerpt from the thread about arylcyclohexylamines I created last year:

EDIT: oh, I see **sekio** has already posted it but to clean everything up:


At that time I would need exactly 100mg of ketamine HCl to get a proper K-Hole experience so it was really nothing different. It was rather like ketamine-without-panache feeling.![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif) This was a > 99% lab grade sample just like all PCP derivatives I wrote about.


Like I said in the previous thread in the OD, if you count the electronegativity of the methoxy group by the method I used, you get a value very close to chlorine electronegativity. And electronegative groups are placed on *ortho* position to decrease psychotropic effects. So that's probably why you don't have such a bodyload and hard-on-the-mind feeling after ketamine, most have after PCE.


I can ask other people who also consumed this compound from the same batch and via different ROAs if they have some description of the experience in their old notes and I will check my old notes because I guess I collected all notes anyway (but it may take some time, I've got a flight in a few weeks and a lot to do for my moving from Poland).


This just popped into my mind... There are countries like mine (Poland) where there's a list of illegal substances but there's no analog act or anything similar so according to the act of illegal substances this is 100% legal. I guess this one has a chance of substituting ketamine in countries like Poland because in the US and in the UK this is going to be as illegal as ketamine.

The analogue act only applies to schedule 1 (and 2?) substance(s), but I don't know if this compound could be considered an analogue to pcpy or other related schedule 1 dissociatives (if there are any), as I know nothing about orgo chemistry.

Nice to see work continue on K analogs.


Hopefully the U.S. doesn't move Ketamine up to S2. As long as it remains S3 its not subject to the analog act. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


It will be hard to top Methoxetamine with its increased therapeutic value combined with its rational drug design of reducing bladder toxicity vs Ketamine. But, will keep an open mind.

Yeah ... I wonder why this wasn't sold long ago if it's a way to avoid legal issues and get the same subjective effect. Maybe people just didn't know. Well, I guess we'll know that was it if 2-MeO-ketamine is everywhere in a few months, heh.

This sounds fantastic, some samples need to get thrown out. Even if it was less potent it's still interesting.

This is literally the closest you can get to ketamine without actually being ketamine, since only K is controlled in the UK it's legal in theory. In practice I would not be suprised at all if people ban this as an analog or treat it just like ketamine though.

Hey, stop bumping the thread if you have nothing useful to contribute. This is (as of yet) a completely hypothetical compound and bluelight is not a rapid-response forum.

is there any logic behind the 2-MeO substitution? I faintly remember reading somewhere that the 2-chloro substitution of ketamine has the purpose of increasing the opioid activity of ketamine. is that true? it would be great if someone more knowledgeable than me could comment on that.


also, what is the reason for the 2-keto substitution on the cyclohexyl that ketamine, tiletamine, methoxetamine and this compound have in common? obviously, it makes these compounds much less potent (in terms of active dosage), but also less toxic compared to e.g. PCP.

I guess one of the main reasons for putting the carbonyl on the saturated ring is that it provides a starting place for metabolism to munch on the molecule. So it reduces duration of effects and half life of the compound. That makes titrating the dose a lot easier in medical settings and leads to shorter recovery/wake up times.

I imagine the keto-function significantly changes the phamacological profile and therefore subjective effects too (compare 3'-MeO-2-oxo-PCE and 3'-MeO-PCE), but I haven't sampled the latter.

The reason for chloro group on *ortho* position is its electron withdrawing properties, it makes the compound have less psychotropic properties (ketamine vs. tiletamine that has 2-thienyl group instead of phenyl and no electron withdrawing group, if whoever has taken tiletamine, he/she knows it's not really a light drug). Like I previously wrote you can count electronegativity of a functional group, methoxy seems like a good substitute for chlorine regarding both electronegativity and size. Also again, I have taken 2-methoxydeschloroketamine - it's not a wonder drug (although I understand why some are so excited - legal ketamine substitute might show up!).


Placing a carbonyl group on position 2 has already been explained. Easier metabolism leads to decreased half-life and easier excretion. It does change drug affinities at different sites, that's SAR. 2-carbonyl compounds have greater affinity to opioid receptors than compounds with nothing there.


There was some site explaining it all in a simple language but I don't have the address and I don't know if it's still up (well, I noticed such sites often disappear...).

so you think that the ketamine analogue without the 2-chloro-substitution on the benzene ring (i.e. 2-phenyl-2-(methylamino)cyclohexanone if I have gotten my IUPAC nomenclature right) would be even more psychedelic/dissociative than ketamine, which would it make more similar to tiletamine? if one would lengthen the methyl to ethyl to get 2-phenyl-2-(ethylamino)cyclohexanone, one would most likely get a compound of similar properties, but a bit more potent, right? all those possibilities sound so very very exciting to me...![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

Well, 2-(methylamino)-2-phenylcyclohexanone actually existed (not sure if it's still an impurity in ketamine or not, or if it is/was sold as ketamine anywhere, I'm guessing the UK is the biggest "K market", but I think lazy asses preferred to start with plain benzonitrile) on black market and it's simply called deschloroketamine. It's more potent mass/mass compared to ketamine and effects are much more PCP-like, maybe not counting bodyload. It's not really so "wild" as tiletamine, I mean I'd rather describe it as a plain dull dissociative, definitely not psychedelic, not at all. Sure, it's possible to go "holing" but it's not the same after all.


So unfortunately, both 2-(methylamino)-2-phenylcyclohexanone and 2-(ethylamino)-2-phenylcyclohexanone wouldn't get much of attention in manner of longer time. That's my experience with lab grade deschloroketamine.

It's more potent mass/mass compared to ketamine and effects are much more PCP-like, maybe not counting bodyload.

sounds very interesting to me, many thanks for your input! I would definitely like to try them all, just because I am an arylcyclohexylamine connoisseur. also tiletamine is still on my to-do list - if only I could find it... ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)

Yeah, it's legal in the UK at the moment, there's no catch-all clause for arylcyclohexylamines. I imagine that if it got popular (which it surely would), it would be put on the new temporary schedule they're bringing in, and nothing's ever coming off that.

Well, it surely would on the black market and it might even push ketamine schedule up eventually if more arylcyclohexylamines started to show up on the streets (I don't know how ketamine is spread across the UK, I hope it's not hard to find![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)). Anyway, I'd rather see 2-MeO-deschloroketamine coming on the streets than plain deschloroketamine because the former one at least resembles ketamine and the latter is substantially different.

^Ketamine was everywhere in the UK until recently, a change in the law in India has really pinched supply.

Interesting...


I've had street ketamine which sent most people into a psychotic state, how I imagine PCP to be like. It looked and tasted just like real ketamine but had a strange undertone. Perhaps this stuff already exists?

Can we stay on topic? ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


It's definitely a point worth debating whether it's stimulants or dissociatives that get the better hand when it comes to RCs. However this is a topic for discussing 2-MeO-Ketamine, and I suspect a debate over which RCs we need to see more of would last several pages and divert even further from topic than it already has.


All in all, 2-MeO-Ketamine sounds interesting if you think it'll have a similar potency to Ketamine itself Sekio, I look forward to hearing more.

Well, staying on the topic, there's nothing much left to say. I don't know what's going on in the UK concerning MXE and PCP analogs being sold as ketamine but such sources selling something else. But bad move 'cause it's not hard to riddle out K is not actually K if you've had lab grade K and lab grade analogs of PCP and PCE. In this case 2-MeO-deschloroketamine could be a good enough substitute but if it appears on the street, it might really push plain ketamine up in schedules and it's enough for other analogs to be considered banned, end of story.![:|](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eyesclosed.gif)

I would have to disagree with this sentiment. MXE has been a very popular drug for some time now and has a very safe profile of effects. Some users have reported consuming doses up to a gram in a single session without ill-effect. It hasn't been in the media spotlight as an evil drug that kills children like Mephedrone. Also Ketamine has been in the news for the past couple of years as a powerful anti-depressant "wonder drug". There was a major report on NPR just last week detailing the use of Ketamine as an anti-depressant.


I just can't imagine this will be considered as much of a harm as cathinone derivatives and put on an emergency ban list. There's very little street market for K here in the States. At least compared to amphetamine derivatives and cannabinoids.


Just my opinion though.


I'm personally excited for this compound. I just hope my MXE tolerance won't impact the effects of this, I much prefer ketamine to MXE but the latter is so much cheaper.

I'm excited to see this happening, what scares me though is the more Ketamine analogs we have out there, and if the majority of people enjoy them, then I fear that real Ketamine will be replaced. Why go through all the legal BS to get real K out there when you can just have a lab make a shitty alternative legally.

^There was a reply to an MXE report somewhat recently describing a friend finishing off a gram and ending up flopping around on the ground and foaming at the mouth. They were taken to the hospital. The replier insisted that 1 gram wasn't that high for some reason. I suspect they were one of the innumerable k-tards who enable their own gluttony by willfully embracing ignorance and choosing to make dosage judgments from within their bubble-like milieu of fellow k-tards rather than using the wealth of reports instantly and conveniently accessible to them online. I think they're getting desperate during the current drought, turning to MXE, then getting frustrated because it's not K and basically deciding "fuck myself and semi-responsible users, I'm gonna do this shit until I'm in oblivion, one way or the other. If I happen to survive maybe later I'll vent by insisting MXE is a shit product online." I don't know how accurate the report of that one gram dosage is, but it's all I can think of indicating MXE may be physiologically dangerous at a gram or under (at least for some people). 


Then of course who could forget [that thread](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/606071-MXE-overdose) we had here recently by phatass? Mr. phatass took three grams along with massive doses of 2C-P and 25C and went into a coma. He spent 8 days hooked up to IVs at the hospital, which ultimately brought him back from the acute kidney failure he had been experiencing in his (presumably) MXE induced coma. Afterwards he came into PD completely befuddled as to why taking one hundred or so times a recreational dose of an untested dissociative might be expected to result in a life threatening overdose. Phatass was quite tolerant to dissociatives, but, again as above, I suspect it was inconvenient for him to conclude that maybe a tolerant brain doesn't equate to tolerant organs. 


It'd be fascinating to capture some dissociative fanatics and put them in a Skinner box kind of scenario.  Trouble is, if one tries to bag them in their natural habitat tranq darts aren't gonna do the trick... pretty much have to bludgeon them.

if you have a dissociative toleranse 1 gram goes away very quickly maybe not in one session but 2-3 at most. its kinda sad and sucky but thats what you get for doing too much k...

> I would have to disagree with this sentiment. MXE has been a very popular drug for some time now and has a very safe profile of effects. Some users have reported consuming doses up to a gram in a single session without ill-effect. It hasn't been in the media spotlight as an evil drug that kills children like Mephedrone. Also Ketamine has been in the news for the past couple of years as a powerful anti-depressant "wonder drug". There was a major report on NPR just last week detailing the use of Ketamine as an anti-depressant.

There will always be some guy/girl that ruins it for all of us, I've been traveling a lot lately and seeing RC use across the world is pretty interesting how it spreads.


There was a guy a few weeks back I was talking to who said he was IVing Methoxetamine mixed with powdered Cannabis and peach juice.


*Facepalm

Sorry that was off-topic but yes, there are people in this world that do such a thing; it almost screams Methoxetamine ban. The sad thing is, that's probably not even the thing that will kill him in that cocktail; but of course it'll be the blame.


*Also, haven't you guys heard about the whole VICE/roflcoptr mess, it's only a matter of time.

Yeah it's pretty sad that people have a habit of taking wonderful therapeutic compounds and giving them naive pseudo-names and linking them to generally stupid and uneducated drug use.

I know it would be impossible for them psychiatrists to prescribe ketamine for people suffering from depression. But I would like to see ketamine used in the hospital wards for people suffering from depression and anxiety. I can't see that coming. So we get nothing from magical antidepressant qualities of ketamine. Just like marihuana, it's the public enemy number 1 in my country after one party stated they would try to depenalize at least possessing amounts for one's own use (too bad they don't mention how many diseases can be cured or helped in some way with it, they don't quote any scientific journals - that would help a lot of people against it understand it's actually them who is wrong about marihuana; and they're wrong about most psychoactive substances). Another promising antidepressant (or rather its derivatives) is buprenorphine, it worked wonderful for me, it lifted my mood during the period I used it and it was something totally unlike dirty feeling one gets from SSRIs.


Big pharmaceutical companies won't let this all happen because they make too much money off SSRIs, SNRIs, etc. which simply just pretend to help, then you start feeling like a crap so some non-working anti-anxiety medication is added to the treatment. Eventually you're tapered off one shitty (S)(D)(N)RI to be transferred to another shitty one. This generates so much money because these drugs are expensive. In reality even when you compare the synthesis of ketamine or Bentley compounds with the syntheses of any of these novel (S)(D)(N)RIs, you see it costs less to synthesize the former. Buprenorphine synthesis - no refined substrates.


I am really sorry but if such bills like SOPA and ACTA are passed in the U.S. just like that, in the 21st century, then I don't believe ANY substance being a real real antidepressant will ever enter the market.


Really, if it's anybody's fault that ketamine isn't used in medicine as an antidepressant, it's not black market's fault or some "RC vendors' " selling various arylcyclohexylamines.

I'm really intrigued about 2-MeO-Ketamine. Are there any full on trip reports about? I haven't been able to get ketamine since around october last year, everytime i've got it since, it's either been cut to fuck and incredibly week, not even hole achievable. And i made the mistake of ordering MXE and that was just straight up awful, I hope to god it get's banned then hopefully people will stop shifting it saying it's K as much.


 But yeah, i really wanna find something to fill the void.

I described it but it's not a "full on" trip report. It's very similar to ketamine, even in dosage. The metabolism of the two compounds certainly looks different concerning *ortho* position but then again chloro group isn't one of the hardest group when it comes to "ability to leave". I wonder if 2-fluorodeschloroketamine would be of some use and maybe it would last a bit longer. But I guess active metabolites of ketamine are mostly N-desmethylketamine and some hydroxylated on the aromatic ring compounds.

That's so not cool that you'd hope it be banned just because you didn't personally like it. Its not MXE's fault that douchebag dealers sell it as ketamine.

Very unlikely ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


Norketamine still has a chlorine atom at the 2'-position on the phenyl ring. The compound discussed here has a methoxy-group at this 2'-position instead of the chlorine. Therefore the N-demethylated metabolite lacks chlorine and just isn't norketamine.


I personally would like to have the thread title changed, because that name (2-MeO-Ketamine) is kind of misleading. I know, I know, it's just a name, but it's incorrect ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) Maybe change it to 2'-MeO-2-Oxo-PCM or something else more systematic?

Well it appears as if we may have to wait quite a bit longer for this to become available to test as it's (1) route to the general public seems to have been disabled although I'd be shocked if it doesn't become available with in the next year or so especially with the preemptive hype it's been getting

There's an off chance I got given this. I got given a sample from a well trusted source, unnamed of a new RC coming out 'half way inbetween ket and ketamine, that isn't publicly available yet, and hasn't been tried by many people'. Long story short, it was a very stupid idea to take it, it stuck me as very dangerous, and it might well have been 2-MeO-Ketamine, since this is the only ketamine analogue I could find that could be near release. This might not be the right place to post it, but if anyone gets samples of any new ketamine analogues, be very careful!

Well, I was going to write up a brief trip report/warning, but I thought it might get regarded as an 'ID this' thread and deleted. I had already been up 36 hours, and been at a rave the night before, I was very drunk and had been on speed and whizz, but the effects had mostly gone of those. Was a stupid idea to take it, but i did about 70mg, and a friend did about that.. the body high was pretty ket like, but it didn't space me out like ket and MXE do.. I found it to be closer to MXE. It baffled my head.. I thought there was more of 2 of us in the room, I was sure I'd been speaking to other people but my friend reassured me I hadn't. Visually it was at times more intense than any acid I've had.. Only way to describe it is I was very floaty and in a dream like state; I could kind of control what I was seeing to an extent.. I got a weird effect where everything seemed really distant, or the room seemed twisted, and spinning, and I was seeing full on hallucinations, like my friends in my peripheral vision, that where occasionally saying things to me.. When I closed my eyes it was as if they where open. I was full on watching myself walk around the rave I'd been at the night before. None of that was worrying to me, I can handle a trip and I enjoyed it.. If you weren't used to hallucinogenics though I can imagine that it would scare hell out of you.. body high was kind of ket like, but like I said it didn't space me out like ket and MXE.. though I did get some serious disorientation where I forgot where I was. worrying bit came in at its peak, about 2 hours in after a joint, where my heartbeat skyrocketed (I'd guess my pulse 120+), I could feel it through my body, my heartbeat was irregular at times, and I got chest pains. I was full on convinced I was going to have a heart attack.. I managed to stay really calm, but it just didn't go for hours. Then I came down and had a good nights sleep.


My friend took it, he weighs a good few stone more than me, and he only got a body high.. but he did say his heartbeat worried him too, so what effects you attribute to what I'd took you can decide, but in my judgement most of it was due to the RC..the whizz would have been leaving my system by the time my heartrate peaked, and it had only been a minute amount..


It might not have been 2-MeO-Ketamine, but I've heard there's samples of it about to be released, so just be aware that if it is what I got given, it could be dangerous, so wait for trip reports if you get a sample, or do it in much smaller doses than I stupidly did. 


TL;DR Don't be a dick like me, be careful and respect RC's.

I gotta say, and no disrespect, I very much doubt what you got was 2-MeO-Ket. There are reliable sources out there, although I'm not personally aware of any that have got this, sadly theres a lot of people that are full of shit claiming they got the latest coolest new exclusive RC when infact its probably just a mix of any old crap, worse still some unknown Eric shit.


Like you said, be careful and respect RCs. They can be enjoyable to the right people with the right mindset in the right place, but they aint for eveyone.


On another note, I really do hope to see this one fairly soon, I have somewhat high hopes about it.

No disrespect taken.. like I said , I didn't get told what it was, and 2-MeO-Ketamine is the only thing that really fits.. The source I'd got it from I trust 100%, and can tell you it definitely is 'A new RC coming out, not out in the public yet, halfway between ket and MXE'. I can't really say why online, so take what I said however you want.


I think the important part of what I wanted to get across was when it comes out to the public, be careful. If it was what I took, I think it's incredibly dangerous... and obviously if it isn't, it still could be incredibly dangerous. 


I wish you luck getting hold of a sample soon.. I've read samples are being sent out to a vendor that I trusts trusted clients toward the end of this month, but I can't vouch for how reliable that is. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I'd say the media is just as much (if not more) to blame than "the people".  Any so-called news outlet that would do a major story on "roflcoptr"--a stupid acronym made up by probably 12-year-olds--deserves the brunt of our anger.  THEY'RE the ones being irresponsible w/ their reporting by exposing large numbers of people to these drug "epidemics", not the few idiots abusing ROFLCOPTR.  I mean MXE.

I'm not gonah doubt you took 2-MeO-Ketamine as every trip report is appreciated obviously when there is such a lack of knowledge for this chemical. But sleep deprivation along with a come down came to mind when reading your report and the 'hallucination' like effects.

Thats kinda what I meant when I said I doubt it was 2-MeO-Ket. Theres a whole variety of potential chemicals that could be somewhere between ket and MXE and I am sure considering the current K-drought that theres a fair few chemists/suppliers attempting to develop something to fit the gap in the market. I guess my response was directed more at anyone reading this hoping to get hold of some, I've already seen dubious-looking websites claiming to have this in stock, i also recall "Mesketamine" being advertised and hyped a few months back. That was a massive scam too. (I hope this isn't classed as vendor discussion). **This stuff is not commercially available yet.**


I suppose I've learnt to be skeptical when it comes to the RC market as a whole, probably a good way to be. Personally I'd want to know a bit more than just "its somewhere between ket and MXE" before I sniff something, although if its in front of me I may change my mind. I certainly wouldn't go giving anything to my friends without **knowing** what it was.


I just want people to be careful and responsible.

It's been some time since I took 2-MeO-deschloroketamine but from what I remember and you don't forget such ones, I guess (the same as with 3-substituted and 4-substituted etc.), I didn't get any LSD-like effects and it didn't feel like MXE either. Also, there wasn't really much difference concerning bodyload compared with ketamine.

We can only hope. Sounds almost too good to be true. I can't see it lasting long though if its sold with "ketamine" in the name, at least not in the UK anyway.

People have lives, you know? 8) Besides, I can't see anyone stating that they got their 2-MeO-deschloroketamine from a vendor who was just about to start selling the compound. I've never bought anything from the "RC market".

MXE was recently put on a temp ban in the UK until they decide what to list and schedule it as. It's still technically a legal substance in the U.S, unregulated and uncontrolled.

Yeah i doubt they will ever release the ban, i think it's just a way for them to stop the sale of MXE once it hit the headlines as roflcopter in a magazine. I do want this one to come out though, i have seen a few vendors saying it is in research and development, so hopefully it will come out soon. I got a feeling it will get branded very soon just like MXE was called roflcptr and rhinoket etc. I dont really mind if it gets branded as long as it is still only 2-MeO-Ketamine inside. I have already seen one website brand it as -snip- which i suppose is fitting due to the fact it's the successor to MXE, and from what i read, maybe more potent?

I edited your post, that name, while simply a brand name, leads way too easily to a specific vendor, and in fact is also the name of said vendor - so it had to be removed. 


I also don't think we should encourage the use of such misleading names here. Let's stick to 2-MeO-Ketamine, or 2-MeO-Ket if we must shorten it. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Not a successor to MXE except in terms of marketing maybe. Also, see post #58 by adder in this thread:

Regarding your post, I think it's more likely to be vendor hype if you're hearing it's more potent than MXE. Someone correct me if I'm wrong but from everything we know so far it should be a similar dosage to Ketamine, which is backed up by adder's post.


Of course as with any new drug one should start very low just in case.

This sounds very interesting indeed. Especially with the lack of legit ketamine around in the UK right now. Do we think this would share the glorious afterglow and lingering positivity that ketamine leaves the user with? I personally don't like MXE or find it to really do me any good after, more like depressed after it.


Good to see progress is still being made anyway.

Fuck 2-MeO-Ket, lets bridge the fucking oxygens and see what happens, turn the ketone and the methoxy into a MDO, only being half serious here, would like to see 2-MeO-Ket but I want to draw this thing out.

That's not an MDO, it's a peroxide, I think it would be very unstable, maybe even explosive.

EDIT: You also have the amine group in the wrong place, it should be at the same position as the phenyl group.

Is this even available to people? I'm not asking anything about where and how... just AFAIK it was supposed to become available somewhere, then it fell through.


So I'd like for us all to know if this remains a thread solely for those theoretically interested or for the advanced experimenters like adder.


Dosage information is mentioned no more than a few posts above yours ^ apparently similar to that of ketamine itself.


Experience reports are scarce but what little I read made it sound like the major advantage would be a legal one, while the effects would be somewhere in between likened to those of K and more boring and less interesting than that.

This is just what I distill, but by all means: actually reading the thread may be a good suggestion.


If something I say is not accurate, let this be an incentive for you to chime in and correct me.

As is said: peroxides like this are unsafe. They dissociate in violent ways, oxygen may be generated or the reaction might be very exothermic, the molecule may fall apart into two halves (not sure if there is a conjugation mechanism for a six-membered ring but still...).

But yes, placing the amine function like that resembles ketamine more than the other suggestions.


Please take this discussion to the popular ADD thread called 'I like drawing random molecules'. Seriously, if you want to discuss it, quote these posts here in that thread there and let me know so I can mod this 2-MeO-ket thread.

Hope this isn't too close to sourcing -  but yeh after it was announced by one vendor it all fell through, but I've heard from multiple sources that it's hitting the UK soon. 


Edit: Asked for a trip report and as pointed out in the following post one is discussed at length on the first page. I'd already read it at least twice and managed to completely forget having done so 8)

From post #4 in this thread:

> This is ketamine with chloro group substituted by methoxy group. Like predicted before synthesis they are really similar. With such a dose i.m. it was easy to go K-holing. What’s the difference here? Chlorine is very electronegative but not as much as flourine. This is yet to be examined what concrete impact has methoxy group here because from subjective effects it’s really hard to tell if it’s more potent or less potent. Actually I see no difference. Well, at least I can’t report on any. This is as good as plain ketamine and if ketamine is easier to synthesize – why bother?

@yoyo50, I hope there is some way you can identify it really is 2-methoxydeschloroketamine. I should be in the UK soon but there is no way I can use any laboratory there. Also, the problem is no in-depth research concerning its toxicity is going to be performed unless it substitutes for ketamine and become a serious problem with many people getting addicted (e.g. nobody cared about chronic ketamine administration until a few years ago).


Nothing is really too potent to be sold because everything can be mixed with something causing no toxic effects even at bulk quantities. The problem is unknowledgeable people who would probably think they've been chiseled if they found out e.g. glucose mixed with the substance they ordered.

Great another powerful dissociative will be advertised as a 'cheap, legal and healthier alternative to ketamine'. I can't wait to have another big and dandy 'I'm in denial about being addicted to research chemicals thread', if the methoxetamine one is anything to go by.


I enjoy arylcyclohexylamines, they are my favourite class of drugs, but they demand fucking respect unless you want to appear and be treated like an escaped mental patient. I was actually really happy the tide had come in with the novel-arylcyclohexylamines- it's a pity that a bunch of 17 year old british morons hoovering up half gram lines of whatever the fuck they actually buy are most likely going to be the end of this whole arylcyclohexylamine renaissance.


Basically- I can't wait to try it, but I'm not putting making my order off as long as I did for methoxetamine. This shit is gonna be illegal almost as soon as it hits the markets. I'm in no way opposed to RCs, I just think that powerful dissociatives should have order limits. You can't treat methoxetamine like mephedrone and expect it to play out well.

Hi, 

So what is the official name of compound? i mean i have seen the internet flood with "2-MeO-Ketamine" and there was even a wiki page with that name, then the wiki page changed to "methoxyketamine" and it also has "2-MeO-2-deschloroketamine", whats the deal. Why did 2-meo-ketamine get changed and i can no longer find anything official calling it this!! anyone with a biochem degree enlighten me. Thanks

the component in question is basically ketamine with the 2-chloro group replaced by a 2-MeO group. this means that the correct full chemical name is "2-MeO-2-deschloroketamine"; but since also "2-MeO-Ketamine" already makes clear what is meant, that is often used for the sake of brevity. "MeO" stands for "methoxy", hence the name "methoxyketamine", but that is ambiguous; "2-methoxy-ketamine" would be better. again, the "2-deschloro" has been dropped for the reason described above.

Ironically I think Methoxetamine would have been a better name for this compound than for the current MXE, as this simply is the Chloro group changed to a Methoxy group, whereas with MXE the change is a little more complex than that.


Unfortunately we can't go and switch the names around now because that would cause incredibly confusion and make harm reduction near impossible when people would get the two drugs mixed up constantly.

Rigorous nomenclature would assign the name 2'-MeO-2'-deschloroketamine to the compound in question. 2-MeO-ketamine makes no real sense, as an aromatic carbon can't hold 2 substituents in a stable molecule, as that name would suggest; but it is true that everyone with chemistry background could guess what's meant. Seems like it will come down to personal preference: formal correctness or brevity.

I imagine its gonna taste disgusting like Ketamine, plus if it's less potent needing to use more, yuck the drip is going to be nasty. At least with MXE the dose was smaller.

You think the massive flood of ketamine in the UK could be just someone who's synth'd 2-meo before the online vendors got to it and cashed in on prohibition? Truefax or K head conspiracy you decide.

Hi guys, 


Okay good news! I got a sample through the other day of 2-MeO-Ketamine, Methoxyketamine, 2-MeO-2-deschloroketamine, D***Ket whatever you want to call it!! Hope the bloody name can get sorted out soon cuz its really annoying!


Anyway SWIM, tried a small (approx) 0.1 line (insufflated), taste was similar to K, slightly more burning but not much difference to K. 

feeling came on just like K, slightly more runny nose then K. Then another (approx) 0.1 line was done. This prolonged the effects somewhat. SWIM stated (with a happy face) that it is very similar to K in effect, and the potency was about the same. 


May i add that SWIM has a very high tolerance to K, so methoxyketamine may effect other people much stronger. SWIM did not test after this as SWIM wanted to see how far the rabbit "hole" goes with methoxyketamine at a later date with a larger sample! 


Note: SWIM told me about 3 hours later that there was a definite feeling that SWIM had been on something, that was hard describe, slightly different to K, maybe similar to MXE but very very subtle. SWIM said that the duration was the same, but there was this feeling after baseline that was almost retrospective, which SWIM liked.


I will report more on methoxyketamine once SWIM with no tolerance experiments.


But all in all, pretty much the same as K, with a slight very very subtle MXE glow to it, but without the head insanity. Happy days

So fuck. 


If this is more like ketamine that's a good thing, the problem with MXE is the dosing (people underestimate it and get the coke lines out) alongside that MXE doesn't stop you moving like ketamine does aka crab walk. This stuff hopefully should be much closer to Ketamine. Ketamine is fine for partying on, hence it being a popular drug in the electronic music/rave/whatever scene. This post would've maybe been better when MXE first came about, but now it's a bit more the opposite to what your thinking.


Besides...I've been partying on ketamine since I was about 14-15, no harm done there. Didn't make me appear the moron. The mental patient possibly, but you need a few trips in there too.


Obviously though this thing will probably get made illegal faster. Why? Because there is about 10x more attention on 'research chemicals' as there where when MXE first came about (even though there was some thanks to mephedrone) and also because it's going to be much more popular if it is the people like the trip report above describing. I'd much rather the drug that's popular be the doses of ketamine than MXE. 


Can't wait to have a hoof!

been told its some between mxe and ket dosage, so im gonna start with 50mg, as i done 20mg of mxe first time i tried, altho that developed into a huge tolerance about 5g a week, i have no reason to doubt source as ive had stuff that has come out months before and also stuff that wont ever come out, and haven't had mxe/ket in 3 months..

The batch circulating now requires higher dosage than K, but that is to do with less than perfect synth, the lab is working on a better synth route. 


As for the product itself, it is almost indistinguishable from K (but alas requires higher dosage as of now).

Expect considerable cross tolerance, for they're expected to act on the very same targets. Nevertheless titrating up from a reasonable starting dose is highly advised.

I'm definitely interested in trying this stuff but not until more "trustworthy" vendors start stocking it. I've heard all sorts of shit about the impurities found in most batches of 4-MeO-PCP and the like.

Should this molecule be enantiomeric*, like 'regular' ketamine is?

It should do. More interestingly: Does the Methoxy group constitute a stereocenter?

"Normal" synthesis yields the racemic product (i.e. a 50-50 mixture of both enantiomers) - just like it is the case with 'regular' ketamine.

Asymmetric synthesis is likely too expensive for the rc market.


Formal substitution of the chlorine atom with a methoxy-group does not introduce a new stereocenter.

Well, establishing such a procedure can be very labour intensive and requires chiral reagents for every batch.

One can expect that the profit margin isn't really worth the investment (figuratively speaking, they'd be throwing away half of their product). Folks are likely happy enough to buy the cheaper racemate.

Ah, I didn't realise that the other half would be junked. Just that I know people pay more for the S-isomer of ketamine.  ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


Also, as negative / undesirable / dangerous effects are somewhat unknown in a new substance, would the methyl group actually be more 'human friendly'? Just seems to my untrained eye that it is more 'organic' than a Cl.

Well I suppose 50mg would only be a small dose of ketamine too, so it's not so surprising you didn't hole. Still, I'd probably want to be assured of the purity before I started taking 100s of milligrams. If there is a white batch on the market as suggested a few posts up, maybe someone took the time to clean this one up.

so this kid I know said he had a dream about trying some new mystery rc dissociate. He thinks it may have been 2-meo-ketamine in his dream. Help him identify the substance based on the effects he describes.


So after experimenting with dxm and nitrous in his highschool years, ketamine in his college years, and mxe the past year, he was dreaming really hard about doing some more dissociative rc's.  One night he had a dream about ordering 500mg of a new classified mxe replacement. He was hoping that the product was actually mxe or 4-meo-pcp and that the vendor was just pretending to call the product some vague name. But upon trying it when it arrived 3 days later, he soon found out this was a new dissociative he had never tried...


The substance looked very super white like pure dried ketamine powder and the powder was really fine, except for small clumps that looked like how mxe clumps up sometimes due to moisture... upon tasting a dab on his tongue, it reminded him of the chlorine taste of ketamine. He snorted a few milligrams preparing for a potent trip if it was 3-meo-pcp or something similar. Nothing. He took note that it burned more than mxe. Smells slightly like the ketamine chlorine chemical.


15 minutes later, he snorted 25 mg and noticed he felt ever so slightly tranquil and dissociated for a few minutes. He now accepted that this new substance is not very potent and was fearing it may be dxm powder which he never has experienced or seen. Or perhaps 2-meo-ketamine. So he went into his house to do a standard ketamine line roughly 100 mg. After snorting the powder, he felt instantly dissociated, like within under a minute. It felt like the powder directly saturated his brain and was instantly high like sucking on nitrous. He was shocked at how fast it hit him. He has NEVER done a drug nasally that hits him that fast. The wah-wahs were in full effect.


It wore off 20 minutes later and he felt pretty clean and sober within an hour.


Throughout the afternoon and evening, He split the rest of the 400mg into 3 doses. The first two being about 75 and 125 mg, and the last dose roughly 250 mg. He tried to reach a hole but never did. Much like when he was doing too much mxe and couldn't reach a m-hole anymore.


The 250mg does was done at night 2.5 hours his 125mg line. Snorting it would get him almost instantly high like nitrous. And everytime he was high, he remarked at how this substance feels the closest to nitrous out of all the dissociatives he has tried. Did someone make nitrous oxide powder he wondered?


The last dose was pretty fun for him as he sat under the stars and got the usual drifting focus of objects as he tried to stargaze. He noted that there was not much distortion of spacial perception and objects like dxm and ketamine. The drug felt really clean as well. DXM makes him feel the worst bodyload followed by ketamine. Mxe feels alot cleaner to him because of the stimulation but often feels slightly shitty and sick when it wears off. This was a pretty damn clean dissociative feeling he thought. He even ate food right after the peak wore off on two occasions much like he can do with mxe. No nausea either. 


The best way for him to describe the substance is that it felt like an extended nitrous oxide high. The peak hit within a minute of snorting and lasted for 5-20 minutes. Able to act sober within 30 minutes and felt completely ok to "operate heavy machinery" and do normal things by 60 minutes.  He did notice that his eyes were pinning like how they get on heavy mxe usage.


Anti-depressant lingering effects were around for 2-3 days but his nose took a beating and he feels like it is worse to snort than ketamine. The short binge cause His nose to bleed quite easily now.


So what do you think the substance is that my friend had a dream about? After falling in love with mxe, which he likes more than ketamine, he would not leap to order this stuff again, more as a last resort over dxm.

ive come across this, and despite a mxe tolerance that seems to cross over (doses remain about the same and in the 100mg -150mg range...but i would repeat this dose several times in a night). i am afraid to take a higher dose to try to hole before someone else survives and tells the tale here..


i prefer this, it has a longer duration, although is equally as moorish. its harder to sleep on then mxe. its a much nicer feeling as well, less manic, more able to focus even if not actually able to engage (ie watch telly, but if had too much, cant play a video game...just stare at my controller wondering what button is X over and over. ...


powder has been white, with more of less same taste, texture and bulk as floury MXE was...


its become my fav dissociative by far, i no longer miss MXE long live 2-Meo-Ketamine


oh. my only dissapointment, i cant manage to hole on it. but then i have not tried higher doses. after a evening i did experience raise in blood pressure, but not noticably my pulse (i didnt measure either, just by feeling)..this passed in about 20min. after that im afraid to try higher doses in one go. music appreciation is "MEH" MXE and DXM and even 4-meo-pcp-poison makes me want to lie in bed and float off listening to music which sounds amazing, but this substance doesnt quite do that predictably enough, however it is nice being able to talk, and follow films etc 


it is just as morish and compulsive as MXE. just more sedate.

Could the reason that you didn't hole be because of some lingering MXE cross tolerance?

you mean 2-MeO-ketamine has a longer duration than methoxetamine? do you have really 2-MeO-ketamine, or that branded product with the stupid name which may or (more likely) may not be 2-MeO-ketamine?

i was told it was a sample of 2-Meo-Ketamine..but i have no way to tell. i have tried the branded product  (i swore i would never low to that again many years ago after the meth ban, lots of poisons sold as "the next best thing EVER" ...and actually despite the fact that it could be anything, i like that too..i suspect that is left over MXE with something else mixed in it maybe. virtually indistinguishable the branded one, if you have had a few lines has a after taste that TOO MANY of the branded crap has...must be a generic mixer or something. it all tastes the same, slightly nasty in the nose...


both were very similar. the main difference between the two is the 2-meo feels a bit like being underwater. which i guess is k like (only taken k once due to the law) 


at this stage when people are clammering to try the new (hyping) drug, who knows what is being sold, touted and palmed off as anything new by who. ....curse to the lack of regulation. to quote the Wire "what do you do with a product thats not selling? ..change its brand" (or words to the effect)....out of interest anyone have an idea what this branded stuff is? some say it is left over MXE, others that it is 2-meo-ketamine, but i doubt this if its not available yet from trusted places, why would it be for sale in bulk from the lowest of the low under a brand name? (other then to make it harder to ban)


the "branded" one is being sold by the dodgy sites (to say the least)..if you google it, they all look like they could actually be the same site, just different name (snip if thats not allowed)


as for not being able to hole, very likely cross MXE tolerance. i have no idea how long to leave tolerance to get that side of it back, a few days makes a difference to how strong the hit is, but the dissociative trip has not come back....could i have permanently drained my receptors? how long a break should you have to return to normal? (my MXE use and tolerance was very high for a long time, i think my first hit of this did put me close to a hole (i remember now, lots of CEVs and i was on my bed with headphones on blissed out)...again on a second attempt in the garden sunbathing with music on... but since. nothing. :S


EDIT: ad emphasis on not being 100% of the validity that what i was given was 2-Meo-Ketamine...or it purity. it was handed to me from someone else who obtained it. all i can say is thats what i was told, and that was the label on the bag it came from. <shrugs>

Hi, 


I posted a report a about 2-meo-ketamine or methoxyketamine on here a week or so ago and it has been removed. It was a report by SWIM on a labelled sample of Methoxyketamine i had received from a large laboratory in China. 


Can someone explain why it was removed or where it is. Thanks

No....anyone...?


Okay well i remember most of it so here it is. lets hope it doesnt get removed again!


Based on the following trip report, Methoxyketamine or 2-MeO-Ketamine is pretty much the same as Ketamine and doesnt have any of the weirdness people reported with MXE and other arylcyclohexylamine's on the RC market. infact, SWIM was really happy that there was finally a good replacement for actual K available. Lets hope this one gets release very soon. anyway here it is ......


So SWIM (actually really was someone who wasnt me) received the sample from the supplier. Sample was slightly brown colour and smelt like K. Slightly more sticky texture, not as crystal as K, or other RC's like these i.e MXE. 


SWIM has a high tolerance to K, but i dont think had had any in a few days. A small 0.1 maybe 0.2 amount was insufflated (only had 0.1 scales which didnt pick up the amount, next time we will have 0.01 scales). The sample was 500mg so pretty easy by splitting it by eye to estimate how much was in each line. 


upon insufflation, SWIM said it was ever so slightly more burning then K or MXE but not much difference in SWIM's opinion. after 2 minutes SWIM said there was slightly more nasal mucus (nose running) then with others, but again, nothing enough to be annoying, and all quite subjective qualitative things really. SWIM said backdrop was same as K.


After about 10 mins SWIM noticed classic K feeling of wobbliness and dissociation. SWIM smiled after about 15 minuted saying that it was really similar to K, and SWIM was really happy that it was not like MXE! SWIM did another 0.1/0.2 and the effect came on the same. SWIM did point out that there was a very slight feeling glowing feeling that SWIM experienced with MXE but not so much with K. But this glowing feeling was again very slight and not as much as MXE. effect gradually wore off up till about 2 hours later when SWIM said it was gone and in retrospect, felt like there was a definite feeling like SWIM had something ever so slightly different to K. 


All in all the effect were to what was expected of this compound based on its chemical properties. Same dose as K but maybe tiny tiny bit stronger. Same Duration, but again tiny bit longer. feeling just like K, but with slight MXE glow, but without the weirdness of MXE. 


Next report will be of trying to "hole" with it by taking larger dose. and maybe attempt at cooking it up to make it white powder like K or MXE. 


Although we were told by supplier that this was simply first synthesis, and that the next would be more pure with a white crystal appearance. So take in mind the colour and texture of this sample may reflect the trip report given here, as it may have been slightly impure.

Yeah I get the feeling this one won't be about for a while yet, maybe never. 

I've been told they had the batch in the country and it was being tested, a tweet now 9 days ago on one site said testing was complete.


So what's the hold up? Have they forgotten to pick up some baggies? Scales broken?  Im dubious

The fact it has "ketamine" in the name means it's gotta hit the UK market at some point, there's no way vendors would pass up such an obvious cash cow.


But as usual, they have announced it far in advance to create hype, and then proceeded to announce weekly "it's nearly here now!" to continue said hype 8)

I don't wanna go into synth discussion but if this is made the same as K itself it does not follow a route similar to PCP at all that would involve a nitrile such as PCC (which would be the most grave concern as it is with 4-MeO-PCP).


So I don't think there is a direct reason to worry about that sort of impurity unless the lab making it is too sloppy to even get rid of starting materials.


But I wanted to still raise the issue again since if this hypothetically would be a concern (I'm not entirely throwing such a possibility out of the window because I don't know if there are freaky K synth alternatives), I for one would not want to risk a slight improvement over K if I can just get having the safety of getting only ketamine's own fucked up (long term) side effects without having to worry about those of impurities of the unacceptable kind.


I hope I get a chance to try this and give my thumbs up or down on it.

These days lots of K is being intercepted causing draughts, but not sure if they have the right to seize Methoxy-K. If intercepted and having to be analyzed first, unless there is an indication of the true identity it may be falsely identified as ketamine. In any case it will take up time. But I find it hard to believe all of it is intercepted.


I've had contact with someone who sems to already have had a sample, let me check.

Yeah I get that, I am sure it'll hit the streets at some point, like you say there is a market for anything ending in 'etamine' 


I just don't think that anyone who is currently advertising it has had anything other than a few grams of sample from the lab. I doubt it's anywhere near full scale production with a reliable synth yet, can't imagine it's much harder or really too different from synthing ket, I stand to be corrected by anyone with greater knowledge however.

Bang on!


...


Jesus, why are some of youse so impatient about the release of it? Is it just for the sake of it or because you really want to know how it feels? If the latter is true, then you have been answered the question many times. That means you won't lose much if you take straight ketamine instead of the super-dandy 2-methoxydeschloroketamine with its cunning, decadent, effete, overrated, and definitely out of fashion name - like we didn't have enough of all those "methoxies". 


Fasten your seatbelt lest you should get thwarted in hope for when you see this "mexxy ketty" is no better it shall displease you.

Same reason I am waiting on its release... I can't get quality ketamine. If I went for a 4 hour drive and met of with some fucked up people I could possibly get either ripped off or sold some 50% ketamine with the rest being random additions from random dealers... I would like to be able to order a fair bit of this stuff when it is released because it sounds about right and the price shouldnt be too bad.

Well, as far as I know here, there's a problem with ketamine on the street, especially if people were selling it it in powder, now most of them don't do that any more and the rest has some fishy stuff. But if you've got contacts, you can still get pharm grade ketamine. I don't know anyone importing it in high quantities from some countries like Pakistan or some Southeast Asian countries. It's not that big in my country after all. It's not like you could ever buy it entering the club instead and snort instead of ecstasy. It was the most popular when it hit the UK. A few month later it flooded some areas in Poland when some people coming back especially from London had a lot of K to sell it. And it weren't always the biggest cities, e.g. if I had wanted the best K then, I would have had to look in a city 60km away from my city.

Pretty much what everyone else said, I wouldn't have a clue as to where to find "real" ketamine. Even when I had a lot of street drug hookups, I never knew anyone with ketamine. Didn't really run in that circle. 


I want 2-meo-ketamine b/c it IS supposed to be exactly like real ketamine ![:-)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

The more proper name for this compound is 2-MeO-2-Oxo-PCM 2'-methoxy-2-oxo-N-methyl-phencyclamine. Traditional ketamine is 2-Cl-2-Oxo-PCM. 2'-chloro-2-oxo-N-methyl-phencyclamine. The methoxy/chloro are on the benzene ring while the oxo (=O) is on the cyclohexane ring. PCE and PCM denotes whether they have a methyl or ethyl alkylated amine group. What is known as 'MXE" is 3-MeO-2-Oxo-PCE, 3'-methoxy-2-oxo-N-ethyl-phencyclamine. It is fascinating how replacing an atom and geometric modification creates such new and special compounds.

I reckon this stuff will be banned in the UK before it's released. ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)


MXE went onto the temporary banning order in March. The fascists in power have 12 months from that date to permanently ban it under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971. So I expect MXE and other flavours of Ketamine to be banned before March 2013. It also wouldn't surprise me to see Ketamine nudged up to a Class B drug in the UK.


Ketamine (and its chemical cousins) has been demonised in the media recently because, IMO, of its emergence as a effective treatment for depression. The powers-that-be obviously don't want any competition to the current (often ineffective) anti-depressants made by their favourite pharmaceutical companies…

seriously man take of the tinfoil hat...


Ketamine and mxe gets shit because they are very very addictive drugs that most people cannot handle wihtout getting some kind of problems.


I see myself as a responsible drug user because the only drug ive ever abused was weed, but mxe makes it really hard to keep calling myself that.


Anyway ive had my binges with these drugs and im glad i never got stuck for real, but they are not to be take lighty..

> Theresa May commented in her reply to the ACMD that "the next step in this process is for the ACMD to undertake a full assessment of methoxetamine for consideration for its permanent control under the 1971 Act." She goes on to say that she hopes the ACMD will do this as a part of the review of ketamine, "including its analogues" and that this review will be completed "within the 12 months from the making of the current order".[17]

Ketamine is under review, signalling a rise to class B IMHO, and May would like this completed within 12 months of the MXE ban. The analogues are to be included, although an arylcyclohexamine ban will be a very broad one, no good at all for research.

And 2-methoxydeschloroketamine is what, you think? If this gets mainstream, it's on its shortest way to get banned. Especially if there's such a problem with ketamine availability. And there are many people addicted to ketamine taking over 1g a day. That's a lot and causing physical harm on a longer basis. If I were to choose, I'd prefer 2-methoxydeschloroketamine to methoxetamine to stay legal.


I'd really be glad to use some of this stuff to help me finally taper off methadone but no, it's not happening. I don't think I will be in the UK any time soon. Thus, I couldn't really care less. Besides, living in the world where so many harmless plants are put on the illegal substances lists makes you not really care if something is legal or not. Actually I don't really care if what I use is legal or not.


The problem with ketamine in the UK is now some guys having no idea what to do with their lives started buying K in bulk from South East Asia and selling it at much higher prices than it's worth. A typical situation, just like with MDMA... First Ecstasy pills started to be MDMA/amphetamine, then they started to contain mostly stimulants and some poor equivalents of MDMA, now there are things worse even than amphetamines in there. The same happens with ketamine, its quality dropped once dealers saw real business in it and started adding adulterants.

I dont know if this response is out of line but wtf!


I found a guy at a local underground drugforum who actually sold this stuff, it was obviously the first weak batch going around since everyone who had bought from him said it was very weak and almost bunk.


The guy had a good rep at the forum so i doubt he was ripping people off but who knows.

Just received a 150mg sample, slightly beige off-white colour with the label 2-(2-Methoxyphenyl)-2-(methylamino)cyclohexanone. Powdery and a little clumpy, slight nondescript odour. Taken 1mg test sample orally with no noticeable effects after 1hr. Will try a larger sample and provide a full trip report later today.

Ive seen this being labelled as 2-MK and a far better name than 2-Meo-Ketamine if you ask me, selling any new RC with the word Ketamine in its name is just begging to get the attention of the media.

I have also seen this for sale now - but at a price over 3 times the cost of what you'd likely pay for ketamine.

I don't think MK2 is a stupid name, it's just an abbreviation. It's what we are going to call it too, or do you want to write 2-methoxy-descloro-ketamine everytime?

i heard about it in february for fucks sakes, first batch came out april, thats what id normally expect, now another 4 months on top of that! its getting ridiculous, im gonna get street k instead, im willing to accept impurities, dealers and effort to get some now, even when they do bring it out its gonna be insanely overpriced

im probably doing myself a favour

It's more expensive, but it is still available, although I am close to Bristol and so possibly enjoying an abundance that others are not.

I only found prices on sites that haven't had it for sale yet. I guess it's not much as for salaries in Pounds and in Euro (but Western Europe only) otherwise it's always going to be expensive just like with any new and/or popular "research chemical". I don't think ketamine is better per gram on the streets in London and areas around it.

I hope it isn't methoxetamine prices as others have said, that would be ridiculous tbh. hoping for half the amount for this substance on release due to potency but i doubt that will happen...

Can't give prices (against the rules), but accounting for their relative potency it's going to be roughly 4-5x more expensive than MXE.

Also due to MXEs popularity and ketamines it's clear this one wont be going cheap as faster bans are now occurring too so it's all $$$. I'm just happy that there is ketamine around at the moment but looking forward to seeing this one come out. Hopefully wont have any dissociative casualties which MXE seemed quite prone for.

No, but it may definitely vary among sellers right now and still you know it's not the final price. I'm sure it will go up. This has been long awaited and constantly considered as the closest dissociative to ketamine. Right now it's just teasing potential clients.


Anyway, I can imagine it will go very quickly for the black market.

Yeah I somewhere that it only has 40% of the activity of MXE. I'm still looking forward to it though if it has effects that are closely resembling ketamine's. Hopefully this upcoming synth will be very pure.

To be honest, I wonder why they didn't go with 2-bromodeschloroketamine first. Bromine atoms aren't that much bigger and both elements have a similar electronegativity. As I'm not in the UK, so any price is ridiculous for me right now, I would rather go with the aforementioned compound rather than 2-methoxydeschloroketamine.

2-MK sounds much better than Mk2 and shorter than 2 Meo Ket, ofcourse the slang names will always be preferred in certain crowds though.


My point is a name that is a little more under the radar should be used

Anything with ket in the name is gonna have the masses crawling all over it, it would bring a whole heap of unwanted attention to the RC scene yet again. MK2 or 2-MK is just some letters that some may not even look twice at, and with any luck it will be around for a bit longer.

what i was meaning teens are going to latch on to it so damn quick swapping it from 2mk to mk2 as in you got any mac 2 that's all .

we all know who came up with the name and im just a bit surprised that they went with such a blatant advertising tag . any way iv seen a few places now saying it will be on the mass market by august at which point i will have to be dabbling in it my self

I think this may have been mentioned in this thread but I can't be arsed to look through 9 pages......some vendors are selling a new substance called KMEX, is this a slang name for 2-meo-ketamine? or just some random bunk shit they are making money off by fooling people that they already have 2-mk in stock?

I think given the close resemblance of the compound to ketamine it's fairly safe too assume it will be possible to hole on this stuff. The chemical structure of mxe is significantly altered and you would expect it to provide a unique experience, I agree at high doses the confusion begins to get really irritating. 


I really hope 2-mk or Tyranno-Ket or whatever is close enough in structure that it keeps that warmth and sense of mental clarity like k. That's what I'm really looking for.


On another note, and I apologise if this counts as vendor talk but there were a couple of places who have claimed to have limited stock of this stuff and sold out really quick, I was tempted but prices were steep and the vendors were shifty, but just wondering has any of it found its way to bluelights' guinea pigs?

I did receive a sample of what I am fairly sure was 2-MeO-Ketamine (Labelled 2MK from one of the more trustworthy vendors). I had a 150mg from a small test batch sent out to a small number of users. I started off with a small test dose (1mg) to test for allergies and then titrated upwards. First 20mg with no effect, then 40mg also with no effect and then the final 90mg with some very slight dissociative most comparable to to a very low dose of MXE (like 10-15mg). All doses were insufflated, however I didn't feel any effects that couldn't be put down to a placebo. Sorry to disappoint, but I don't know if this was a bunk batch, bad administration technique or just a simple matter of the dosage not being high enough.

Praise the Lord, a Trip Report! Thanks SO MUCH!


Perhaps it's because you've not taken 150mg @ once - but it's surely safer to do so. I'd done the same! After what i've read it seems, that this compound won't be that interesting after the MXE-Hype?!? MXE is just so hellish potent! Made a lil' break till yesterday and i'm still impressed what roughly ~15mgs sublingual did for me.  


For now it's lay-off time until there's some 2-MeO-Ket to test out. But i'm defo waiting what others say, otherwise i'll stick to MXE.

I think that's probably why, but I preferred to err on the side of caution with a new and untested compound. I'm confident that this will be one to try once the commercial batches are available and i'll definitely be trying larger amounts.

Is this pure speculation from the initial test batch or solid fact? A lot of test batches of previous chemicals have been rather weak in comparison to how they are after a few batches have been made and the process refined. 


From what I have read it is apparently the same strength as Ketamine (which is active at a higher dose than Methoxetamine yeah), but given that it should have more similarities to the real deal. A higher dose with a possible K-hole would be preferable over a completely new dissociative that bares more resemblance to MXE in my opinion, that is assuming it is at all similar to K anyways.

^Yeah but 6-APB turned out to be good. I haven't seen anyone shilling this compound yet other than those who are affiliated with those selling it under a brand name. It doesn't really need an advertisement, because everyone knows it will be similar to ketamine.

I hope so. ....I really do I am very excited about it ...If it is similar to ketamine it will be great, it would be nicer if it were more potent if your going to tweak a chemical, it would be nice to make it more potent..i guess having the same strength or  slightly less then K ..it wont be "bladder friendly" and less cost effective then say, MXE, although probably a nicer trip....

Is k-mex supposed to be the same as 2-MEO-Ketamine? I've noticed a few places selling it, but seeing as 2-MEO-K isn't even on sale yet. It seems a little suspect. Probably end up being Tiletamine, DXM or some crap similar at best!

I posted the same question further up the page. It'll be vendors taking advantage of the hype and labelling shitty RC's no one likes to get sale probably

Guys, can we try not to just make posts speculating when this will be released? We don't hype shit here, and this thread has been playing loose with that rule/guideline for quite a while. I know how excited folks are for this, but the reports will come in their proper season.

I was grabbing a whole bunch of things at once, your question was legit, I will reapprove it, sorry. The edited one that you quoted however is another matter.


Oh, and avoid purchasing from people who don't tell what drugs they're selling, and just give you some brand name or something marketable to try to cash in the market for another drug. These practices are very anti-HR.

While I understand the point about vendors coming up with daft names for new compounds, I think it's more of a plan to differentiate themselves from other sellers rather than an evil money-making marketing ploy.

I agree with 7zark7 about branding. There are some vendors which use these names without telling people whats inside the "proprietary blend", but from what i have seen from the branded vendor of 2-meo-ket is that it is so customers simply remember the name and also so that people trust that particular brand as being pure 2-meo-ket, in this regard i think it's okay, still a stupid name in my opinion though! 


I read the information on the vendors site and it explains why they branded the chemical.

^The vendors who brand-name their chemicals are typically the ones who are known for heavily cutting their products or just plain misrepresenting them as something else entirely. I will never buy from a vendor who uses such brand-names and flashy graphics to try and sell their products. 


Brand-names dumb us down, and they are for people who can't be bothered to do their research to find out about a particular compound or class of compounds. If you're a vendor who thinks they need to draw pictures of dinosaurs and give your product a gimmicky name in order to sell it, then you're probably not very serious about the chemistry and pharmacology of such compounds.

I agree to a certain extent  that branding is not for the scientifically minded when it comes to research chemicals, but the truth about RC's is that most (80%) customers dont care about the in-depth pharmacology but rather a cheap substitute to their illegal drug of choice! This also is apparent when looking at the RC in headshops, as headshops often sell more of the branded ones because people know what the chemical does i.e ethylphenidate means nothing to your average Joe, but RUSH or CHARGE or whatever, is quite clear. Although, by this argument there is no need to brand 2-MeO-Ketamine because the drug is in the chemical name!


I will never buy from a brand with unknown chems inside, but i will try out a brand to see what happens. Especially since our extinction brand knew about this chemical very very early judging by their website stats i pulled up. 


only time will tell!

I've got nothing personally against the people behind any particular vendors (other than scammers and those known to have sold blatantly bunk products), and I'm not trying to ruin anyone's business, but I will always avoid those who use such marketing ploys to sell their stuff. I want to see that the vendor cares about their customers, cares about the quality of the products they sell, and cares about their integrity as a reputable and upstanding vendor, rather than doing whatever they can to make a quick buck. I feel this is very important in the unregulated market of RCs, where grave mistakes can slip through the net if consumers aren't paying attention.


I was never fond of the term "Ecstasy" for MDMA, and I am definitely not fond of RUSH or CHARGE for ethylphenidate. It just cheapens the whole thing for me, and it shows that the people you are purchasing from care way more about quickly making big money from gullible fools than standards of quality control.


I can tell you that 2-MeO-Ket will be available from vendors who are not using such marketing techniques.

We have been hyped, stalled and cockteased so much about this drug, and pommeled with childlike trade names that I'm not even sure I want to try this drug anymore. Sure I'll pick up some grams but ACK! Just STFU and then one day completely unexpected flood the market with an awesome product, with this stalling tactic theres a risk the drug is scheduled before it even hits the outlets.

if N-ethylnorketamine was mentioned, then it's also not 3 times as strong as straight ketamine. But I guess everyone can get to that conclusion...

well, obviously the wheels of the RC market are turning... I have tried samples of both 2-MeO-Ketamine and N-ethyl-Ketamine provided by a reputable source (i.e. not the chinese scammer). both gave me ketamine-like effects, but while 2-MeO-Ketamine was much less effective than ketamine (only threshold effects at 150 mg nasally), N-ethyl-Ketamine was more potent than regular racemic ketamine. not 3x potent as ketamine, but more potent, maybe similar in potency to S-ketamine (x1.5). as a dissociatives-connosseur, I hope that both compounds will appear on the grey market soon (from what I hear from the source my hopes won't be in vain), but N-ethyl-Ketamine seems to me the more promising ketamine replacement. time to open a new b&d thread, I guess...

I think this is what's going around in my area (and lots of surrounding areas) but it's being sold as K.

Can anyone who has bought methoxyketamine / 2-MeO-Ketamine describe the smell? And color?


Some of the 'ketamine' has been slightly yellow/beige, and smells a bit like mephedrone, but not exactly mephedrone, but a strong smell that I really can't put my finger on. A tiny bit like bleach maybe.


Any information you guys can give would be helpful, thanks. As I'm suspicious that all the strange smelling ketamine being sold in the area isn't actually ketamine at all. Cheers.

I suspect that with all the R&D thats gone into this over the last few months the price will be considerably higher than normal K (at this stage anyway) so its doubtful this will be sold as street ketamine any time soon. No doubt things may change.


Possibly this stuff you found has gone through a different synth route and has its own impurities leading to the colour and smell.

How much N-ethyl-Ketamine have you used? Even with 90+mgs plugged i only got light effects, nothing to fly away or even hole with. Don't even wanna think about what 90+mgs of MXE would've done, so i dunno if these Ketamine-derivates are really worth the money (and from what i've heard they're damn expensive).

How are you possibly arriving at this conclusion? The material hasn't even made it's way to the niche online RC market yet, let alone had enough time to percolate down to those who would sell it on the streets.


It's highly possible that what you have is impure or cut. Finding out what it is cut with is the task.

the 2-MeO-ketamine sample was a light brown sticky powder. some smell, unfortunately I can't remember what it was like (this trial was already several weeks ago), the only thing I can say for sure is that it didn't smell or taste anything like ketamine, but rather unpleasant (while I quite like the smell of ketamine and N-ethyl-ketamine). my guess/hope is that the material was rather impure, and that quality might increase until this compound finally comes to the market.


the N-ethyl-ketamine was a fine powder, perfectly white. smell and taste were similar to regular ketamine.

Don't even wanna think about what 90+mgs of MXE would've done, so i dunno if these Ketamine-derivates are really worth the money (and from what i've heard they're damn expensive).

I have used 200 mg N-ethyl-ketamine nasally over several hours (of course starting with the obligatory adverse reaction test and then slowly increasing the amound insnufflated). this resulted in a medium strength dissociative experience (still far from holing) quite similar to ketamine with only slight qualitative differences. unfortunately, I am quite a hard-head when it comes to dissociatives (and tolerance of course even increased with years of usage, and as you know, tolerance to NMDA-antagonists is partially long-term; but I have no short-term tolerance at the moment), that's why my effects may seem weaker to the light-heads of you than they might suspect. also, I assume that the effects would have significantly been stronger if I had consumed all of my 200 mg sample at once, probably enough for a hole. comparing with my experiences with ketamine, I estimate that the potency of the (obviously racemic) N-ethyl-ketamine is about 1.5x the potency of racemic ketamine, or comparable to the potency of s-ketamine.


about rectal consume: while it works pretty well with methoxetamine, plugged ketamine is significantly less potent than nasal ketamine in my experience. I would not be surprised if the same was true for N-ethyl-ketamine.


what I found interesting is that despite the increase of potency the change of the N-methyl substitution for an N-ethyl causes, the length of the experience was not increased and quite the same than with regular ketamine.

Hahahhahaha! Are you freaking serous? Boy you need to lay off the arylcyclohexylamines! Or else grow up...


Anyways just to add I can not wait for this compound to reach my hands. I would love too see how it compares to ketamine, but honestly I am much more interested in ethyl-ket. I was not a big fan of MXE, which is the only compound I have tried with a methoxy bond to date I believe (such as 5-meo-dmt vs. dmt). I believe that has something to do with it, but I don't know it is just me. Deschloro-ketamine was an interesting one I came across my searches too, although it was lightly described and there is not much info about it. Definitively more interested in the versions that are less of a mindtrip and more of a body trip that connects with sound, while still being sedating.


Any who just my 2c so I did not just look like a jerk trying to seek attention. Go about your discussions I may be back if I try it.

In my experience with research chems is that they often just have to wait for the product to be up to a certain percentage pure, and that can take a while of refining by the supplier to get rid of all the solvents used in the process. This is why i think many people  are not happy with certain new rc's until the third or fourth batch is release. I think eager vendors just take the first sample they get and decide to sell it to be first!


I'm pretty sure they will get it, just are waiting for the best batch. 


On the other hand, i am still a little worried, as they still have not priced!

So it means so-called "research chemicals" are synthesized by some chemists bunglers? Not implying anything, never bought anything via Internet.

Dear PD-ers, please cut out the "insider talk" about vendors. It's very simple: discuss the compound, not anything about acquiring it. If the prevalence of the compound is lacking, this does not qualify you to hint about 'what is taking them so long' or any other topic in the "acquisition stage" of experimenting with this drug.


Rules are rules, don't be surprised if posts get unapproved and pop off the forum or warnings after persistence.

Full stomach, 100mg 2-Meo-Ketamine

Mental effects: Pleasant, positive 'whooshing' body high, ideal state to watch mind expanding films on big screens - a bit short-lived, though.

Body: Leaves you dizzy, giddy with glittering vision. Stumbling is blatantly obvious, drunken but clinical and cold. Little bit dirty, irritating on the nose at first but soon passes. Mucus isn't bad at all! Definitely do this one sitting down, get your drinks fridge stocked and Js rolled beforehand because trust me, walking is not a realistic option.


Waited quite a while for this one, pretty fun and I'm glad I got to try it.

Yeah, i suspect the "description" on the site is probably made up or copied from some old MXE description. I seriously doubt this is anything special or exclusive.


Same principle as bath salts and any other branded shit, if the vendor can't tell you exactly whats in it then don't buy it.

n-ethylketamine is the same as ethylketamine. The "**n**" simply denotes where the ethyl group is on the molecule. This is analogous to n-n,DMT being the same as what people normally refer to as DMT.


n-ethylnorketamine is presumably the major metabolite of n-ethylketamine in the human body. It will probably have psychoactive effects too, like norketamine. (And possibly physiological effects such as toxicity to the bladder/gall-bladder.)


EDIT: Nevermind the last paragraph, I read Transform's post below and I was obviously completely wrong about n-ethylnorketamine.

**N-ethylnorketamine, N-ethylketamine, ethylketamine and NEK are all the same thing**. Starting with the most technically correct and finishing with the least.


N-ethylnorketamine is the most correct because *technically* N-ethylketamine indicates that you have normal (methyl) ketamine **and** an ethyl group on the nitrogen. norketamine is the name for ketamine without that methyl. N-ethylnorketamine is the name for ketamine with an ethyl group replacing the methyl group.

It's been a while since I did chemistry and even when I did I wasn't great but am I wrong in saying that in the picture above "NEK" and "Ethylketamine" are exactly the same... why include the same picture twice and labelled differently, makes more sense to do the picture once and list all its names?

Just a warning to anyone out there thinking of doing large amounts of this 2-MeO-Ketamine. 


Last night Swim took 400mg intranasal from a trusted supplier listed with CAS no. (7063-51-6) as Methoxyketamine or 2-MeO-2-deschloroketamine  of the arylcyclohexylamine class first reported in 1963. It is an analog of ketamine in which the chlorine atom has been replaced with a methoxy group.


He had also taken 2xPyrazolams to reduce anxiousness from another trusted supplier half an hour earlier, which, in all due fairness, probably caused the blackout and was half if not all of the reason behind this experience.


In an attempt to K-Hole he snorted around 400mg in the space of 20 mins which if was normal Ket would do the trick nicely. He has tried this substance at lower dosages and had ok experiences but never as nice as genuine Ketamine and much longer lasting with a similar starkness and lingering affects similar to those of MXE. He also finds he cannot articulate himself properly for a good 6 hours after having come round. Another strange affect noticed is that he cannot usually sleep for hours after dose and this was another reason for the Pyrazolams, which, just to note, he has also done in combination with this substance before and been fine but not in such large amounts.


Dose was taken at around 10.30pm and Swim enjoyed the usual pleasant effects and watched some of Prometheus before drifting into a nice hole/sleep. He then awoke at 5.30am and had to be rushed to A&E after heart and breathing ceased. 


Swim was awoken from sleep/K-hole (according to a good friend (also a trained firefighter)) screaming at which point Swim went motionless had no pulse and stopped breathing. His pupils then rapidly dilated which he believes to be a sure sign of lack of oxygen to the brain. His friend then called 999 and on the phone was about to begin resuscitation when he found a weak pulse that gradually strengthened. Swim apparently then took two short breaths followed by a deep gulp of air and began breathing of his own accord and luckily Swims friend did not have to begin the process. 


The paramedics arrived and Swim vaguely remembers leaving his room on a stretcher, the trip to A&E in the ambulance and then waking up on a drip. He can remember being asked the usual questions that are asked such as what is your name, when is your date of birth etc. and remembers knowing the answer but being unable to articulate it as is often the case when coming around from a K-hole. Swim is now out of hospital and writing this 14 hours later feeling rather sketchy but very grateful to be alive and even more grateful to his good friend for being on hand at the time. 


One thing Swim clearly remembers is a full K-hole or near death experience just before awaking in his room but is unsure whether this was the drugs or a genuine NDE. It was certainly not the same as the NDE's experienced on genuine Ketamine and cannot be described adequately with the use of the English language although he clearly remembers feeling extremely at peace and fully accepting of the fact that he had ceased to exist in the human form.


This is more of a warning to anyone out there trying this substance. Please be extremely careful if taking in large dosages especially if the substance feels like that of which was described earlier when taken in smaller amounts.


Peace out and please all be extremely careful if experimenting with RC's. Swim will certainly not be trying this one again if any.

Please don't use SWIM. Not only does it not protect you, but it makes your posts hard to read - and as such it isn't allowed here at Bluelight.


Also, trip reports belong in the Trip Reports forum - though you can then link to the thread here if you feel like it ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


mahoosive bendah, your post was unhelpful and not very constructive so I've removed it. Please don't post useless one-liners like that.

Well I have received 2 grams of this substance from an extremelely reputable source. It is white and powdery, not quite as granular as good mxe as stated above. 


Sadly I have been hitting the k all day so it's not a great comparison. I tried a small allergy test earlier and despite my better judgement, given I have to get up and be civil to the in laws tomorrow lol, decided to give it a go.


I eyeballed two large ketamine sized lines, maybe 150mg total. Had half if one, left it ten to be sure i wasn't going to stitch myself up and then smashed the rest. Felt a slight ketamine ish feeling but nothing amazing. Racked up another 150-200mg and the effect seem mild to say the least. Actually there's very little there at all. 


150mg of k gets me nicely wonky but twice that dose felt extremely mild.  It stings a little bit when it hits your nose but the drip feels much less caustic than regular k, nowhere near the nasal assault of NEK. This pleases me at least. 


I am going to reserve judgement until I have brought my k tolerance down a bit but I think, at this point it seems just a bit shit. :-(


Oh and I just noticed its XMAS. Merry Xmas everyone.

I think taking ketamine before definitely had an influence on your experience of 2-methoxydeschloroketamine (too bad *mexamine* is already taken). I guess you wouldn't feel straight ketamine well either when re-dosing.


My judgement about 2-MeO-deschloroketamine seems to differentiate from most opinions so far. I don't know what this "2-MeO-ketamine" sold now consists of as a matter of fact. Back in 2010, the structure was confirmed with NMR spectroscopy. I wasn't under some great impression either, but it wasn't so bad as it seems to be for most. I snorted it a few times (from a small reference dose to 200mg) and injected i.m. twice (50mg and 100mg). On a weight basis it was similar to ketamine. 100mg of ketamine = "deep" K-Hole for me and 100mg of 2-MeO-deschloroketamine intramuscularly was also enough for a "hole". It didn't feel uncomfortable at any point, it wasn't stronger in feeling, it wasn't markedly lighter. By "hole" I mean a general state in which I don't pay attention to my body at all, there's a feeling of floating / hovering / hanging in some undetermined space, time perception is disturbed, and there are characteristic hallucinations present, euphoria is not always present. Intensity of these feelings varies depending on the substance. 2-methoxydeschloroketamine felt "deep" as for losing connection with the body, euphoria was somehow lacking in comparison to ketamine (*2-bromo* would probably be more euphoric if electronegativity of chlorine in ketamine is the deciding factor), but there wasn't any dysphoria to it either (subjectively one could describe any dissociative state as dysphoric), it left me rather indifferent.


Methoxy group here has definitely a lower negative charge on oxygen than chloro has in ketamine. Chlorine has a positive impact on MOP receptors affinity and it shortens duration of action. Thus, long story short such a small difference may result in less dopamine (and less *satisfaction* from the experience), so maybe that's the snag.


I came to a conclusion "why bother with 2-methoxydeschloroketamine if ketamine is easily synthesized in comparison and it's better?". The only reason now may be legality but as this substance has the same dissociative properties, it will shortly be made illegal if it spreads (I'm not sure if it does seeing so many problems with releasing it). Anyway, I thought about using ketamine on the New Year's Eve. And if I had a choice between ketamine and 2-methoxydeschloroketamine, I would definitely not go for the latter, but it's a passable substitute.

You've summed up my feeling exactly there mate. I know having taken k previously means i didn't have a good comparison but comparable amounts left me feeling indifferent, it is markedly similar, maybe indistinguishable from ketamine to people inexperienced with dissociatives, however, given the fact it will shortly be scheduled, costs the same as top end street k, I just can't see the point. 


I have a feeling this one will just sink without trace


I think it will be just as addicting as ketamine. I can see no reason why people wouldn't be able to get psychologically addicted to this the same as k, other than once they try k they will get addicted to that instead because it just does the job better

That's true, it's increasingly difficult to get good k on the street round here (UK) anyway. I think that this product will be banned so quickly that it'll just be easier to get Ket. 

This will sell as long as it is easily available. Once it becomes as illegal to source as Ketamine is, I doubt anybody will be bothering

I have used neither N-ethylnorketamine nor 2-methoxydeschloroketamine from any vendors. I have no idea what's there inside. My opinion is based on substances used during a small research I did a few years ago.


edit:

To make it clear, in 2008 I did a research on some arylcyclohexylamines and their derivatives. The last time I remember I had two mentioned dissociatives was 2010 (actually it was the reason why I thought about getting my notes together then).

Yes, there was a small group of people participating. In the end only part of the research was finished due to inter-faculty problems, not going deep into details. I know my memory may not work 100% good as for concrete dates from that period because of opioids and benzodiazepines.


Batches may vary in effects as there are a few possible ways a chemist could choose when synthesizing these drugs (counting in both the starting materials used and different reagents used later). Also, a proper synthesis doesn't take one day. There are a lot of factors that may have an impact on the quality of the final product such as chosen temperature when heat is needed, chosen solvents etc. I'm sure there are by-products present and it doesn't pay off to clean the final product to gain a few % of purity in the end.

But a decent looking NMR of NEK has been done and I'm no expert but a colleague seemed to think they looked right. I'm still inclined to think that the batch is dodgy but how exactly is eluding me.

The compound is the compound. A couple of % impurity doesn't account for the differences we're seeing here. Did you have access to analytical instruments at all or were you working from published syntheses and hoping your recovered product was what you expected?

I've copied my response here from the NENK thread, as it is pertinent. I stand by my diagnosis, as do others actually doing work in this field. Just don't add up. . .


"Would you comment "hey here are a bunchnof reports i just made up based on SAR speculation and basic arylcyclohexylamine knowledge?" I doubt it. There are many inconsistencies in his reports that caused skepticism in those also working with these substances, and now that a few of these analogs have hit the market big time and are in complete contrast to his reports there is no doubt his write up is fiction. BTCP, bromadol? Gimme a break. Notice how he covered all the well known modifications, and theN after methoxetamine was release edited his post to include n something very similar? Several more of his "reports" don't match up to actual trials with these substances. Sorry, but I, and many others, call bullshit.


Trust beagle, hugo24, and a few others from the old days, not some young kid also claiming to work with fentanyl analogs as a teenager. Seriously? Book knowledge and speculation is one thing. Claiming these as actual human trials is downright wrong."

I haven't edited my post after methoxetamine appeared on vendors menu. If it has been edited, I added neither an N-modified analogue nor any analogue. I was totally unaware what "methoxetamine" stood for when it was released and you can find a post confirming that. It'd be 2-(ethylamino)-2-(3-methoxyphenyl)cyclohexanone for me if I were to post an information on it. I hadn't done that because I hadn't taken methoxetamine by then.


If you find my report on N-ethylnorketamine non-consistent with the effects produced by "NENK", "NEK", or "ethylketamine" released by vendors who are actually as trustworthy as a stranger met in the Internet, that's your problem. Have they ever released some more information to you, so it justifies you hurling accusation like that and calling me "some young kid"? Also, please read with understanding, those were general reports based on experiences coming from various people and they were hardly meant to provide the ins and outs of the psychological effects of all those compounds. It's hard to get the same report from different people on a dissociative or psychedelic, they're not opioids. Not that I'm trying or going to try convincing you I'm right, it doesn't matter to me what you believe in.

It's doubtful what you buy from an online vendor is a single compound. A product is not essentially a compound. Impurities may be other arylcyclohexylamines that are either left-overs from the synthesis or added on purpose to make a product stronger and then a few % may change the overall experience (why not add N-ethyl-deschloronorketamine to N-ethylnorketamine or deschloroketamine to 2-methoxydeschloroketamine? the side effect is making the product "duller"). "2-MK" is almost certainly not just e.g. 98% pure 2-methoxydeschloroketamine hydrochloride salt. These people make money on selling *RCs*, it's hard to expect them to be perfectly honest with their customers.


My colleague and I did use existing papers on syntheses of various arylcyclohexylamines, it's perfectly fine with law, but it would be unacceptable to work with substances not tested with a spectroscopic technique. Definitely unacceptable in academic research.

Adder I want to side with you over some dodgy vendors you clearly know your science and technology vendor in question refused to even show me an NMR but a small impurity is not accounting for the massive discrepancies between your reports and current ones. Whatever happens to potency or effects of this compound, an extra carbon should not cause the agonising pain upon insufflation.

That's the proton NMR for the NENK on sale at the moment, taken independently. Would you not agree that looks pretty damn good? I doubt anyone will be able to compare it to a prediction while we're in the christmas break but even to those who can't assign peaks you can see there's only one compound in there.


I think there are plenty of people here who really do want to believe you, but the facts just don't seem to line up. I would be interested to know how you analysed it, perhaps someone could run a comparison of the current material with the same technique,.

I don't follow the RC scene and I don't visit all threads on ketamine analogues, that'd be really time-consuming. I had this one subscribed. I don't know exact problems stuff from vendors present. I haven't seen spectroscopy work on "NENK", so I haven't analysed it either (and I'm not good at it which I posted about earlier). I don't follow the N-ethylnorketamine thread. As for suggested impurities present in the product, it's a purely theoretical explanation for the product causing effects different from those of the compound supposed to be there. "One carbon difference" may yield a compound with substantially different pharmacokinetics and/or pharmacodynamics, e.g. morphine vs. codeine and in the arylcyclohexylamines series - enlarge the cyclohexyl ring and you end up with something very weak comparatively, add one methyl group at position 2 or 4 in the cyclohexyl ring and the result is opposite. Thus, one carbon can make a difference.


I don't find myself in a position to comment on everything betting my life, I'm well aware that there are much more knowledgeable people here having an access to a lab any time they want. If some line in my post reads "was done", it doesn't mean I did it by myself, e.g. no spectroscopy work was done by me, it takes a lot of time and practice to master this branch of science. Anyway, if I desperately wanted to prove myself right, I guess I would have to violate the terms of agreement I ticked registering here and violate law, releasing materials just like that without essential papers. And it doesn't necessarily concern sharing syntheses patterns used per se but the university rights. There are many students here and many graduates, and I believe the law in the UK or in the US doesn't differ much in this aspect from the law in Poland. Students can't publish anything by themselves, they need an advisor who has a degree in concrete field of science higher than Master of Science. I have posted I'm no longer a student of chemistry and I don't study at my old university either any more. Gaining various permissions and posting content violating BL rules somewhere else simply isn't worth the trouble to embarrass some people (I'm currently preoccupied with something needing as much devotion as chemistry needs). It's not important for me to be recognised here as a superbly talented chemist or whatever. I've never considered my works to be special and I don't feel a need to boost my ego because I feel underestimated. I've never posted here or on forums on chemistry to gain popularity. I can take criticism but offence isn't a part of constructive criticism. Everyone has a right to disagree with me, but I don't think showing disagreement needs additional titles as "some young kid", which was definitely used in a pejorative way (I am young but I'm not a child or teenager either), or "bullshit".


edit:

"I haven't seen spectroscopy work on "NENK", so I haven't analysed it either" that goes to: "I hadn't seen it by then, so I haven't analysed it". The image didn't load before I hit "Post Reply". Still, I would have to pass it to my colleague and discuss it with him to give you my honest opinion sounding like I know what I'm writing about.

Has any one considered that the difference between Adders (or adders freinds) experiences with 2MDK and NENK, and the verified pure batches coming from legit vendors, could be that they contain different ratio's of isomer's because of different route's of synthesis.


I personally think there's a huge variance in different pure batches of normal ketamine. And as I understand it, it's now accepted as fact that this stems from the difference in effect from the 2 isormers of ketamine.

some time after puting on my gum ~1mg i proceeded to test a tiny 20mg line 5-6 minutes later a light headadness and peacefulness but nothing too obvious but also definatly not placebo. i have a high tolerance and  don't feel even this from 20mg ketamine, but it has been more than a month since i have taken any dissociative.  

later tongint i will make a proper test and after that attemt to hole...

wow. so on its own 500mg got me where 300mg of ketamin would(no hole but very close) so i aded 25/25mgs mxe&3meopcp + another 100mg 2meo and i was there! k holed like i haven't from a very looong time. 

my conclusion not a strong as ketamine but the closes thing you would get and definatly worth for comboes. only problem with the mxe/3meo combo is that later in the night i realized i unknowingly dosed myself with 25c, it turned out to be a awseoum trip and all but be caferfull this combo is most likely not recomened... and for the recored my the doses are very high i have high tolerance and they should not be taken as dosege advice. if i wasn't in the comfort of my home some very bad things might have happend lol

600mgs of 2-MeO-K along with 25mgs MXE **AND** 25mgs 3-MeO-PCP sounds like a damn big load to me and i honestly don't think this K-derivate is much better than NEK. But we'll see what others say, i'm not really tempted tbh...

it very good for a booster i go to a state very like a khole but difrent in a way, the closest thing ive felt to a khole. on its on it didn't provide khole but all the other ketamine effects was there its very very similar to ketamine i can't belive it, it just seem that its weaker by waight. 

i like it very much nothing like nenk

i a have alot of toleranse and need 500mg+ ketamine to gole so i am very intereseted to see if possible for some ketamine(k-hole) user without tolerance to hole  on this. i have 750mg left and plan on trying it all for a hole in a week or two

Ok i got a gram of this from a reputable EU vendor yesterday.I have no tolerance issues to arylcyclohexylamines,so last night i proceeded to plug 100mg,i had made sure that the colon was clear first by having a massive shit before hand,the 100mg was ineffective,so i decided to insufflate 100mg,the burn was harsh and the drip nasty,although there was a Ketaminish taste.


The powder i had was white and slightly fluffy.Seeing as the two doses had no effect i decided to plug the remainding 800mg,thinking that this would surely do the trick...Nothing.


I contacted the vendor who apologised for the poor results that i had,he also went on to tell me that the feedback was mixed,but through my experience i`m thinking how could anyone have good results from this product? Now i know why the main UK vendors are not stocking this,i shall not doubt their reasons again.


I had tried some other 2-meo-ketamine from another vendor before this one and that put me in a K-Hole but now im thinking that it was probably Ketamine in disguise as i could not distinguish a difference in effects.


From my experience this product it worthless,it`s bunk and not worth the time or money. I have tried Ketamine and Methoxetamine on many occasion so i do know what i`m looking for.

ketamine doesn't work plugged so why would this ? 100mg was a low dose for me from this

but 300-400 gave me hole fx(nasaly). mixed with other dissociatives worked even better. this is definatly active(for me atleast) and is very very close to ketamine, not as strong but really really near the real thing. definatly worth the money. im going to get myself more of this for sure

What makes you think it doesn't work plugged?? It is just another parenteral way to administer like snorting. And I'm pretty sure it will be absorbed, it is just not that orthodox with K.

I can personally confirm that ketmaine works very well plugged. As solipsis says, anything that works snorted will work the same or often better when plugged.

@ Wayab,i`m afraid i totally disagree with you,if 2-meo-ketamine is active then it would work when plugged,even 100mg insufflated should do something,even if it`s only a threshold experience.


I believe that what my vendor has is 100% 2-meo-ketamine,they obviously didn`t test the product before they bought bulk and now have to shift it,they probably got NMR for purity on paper and thought that it should work...But it doesn`t,thats the reason why most UK vendors don`t stock it,but me being bloody minded i had to find out the hard way.

Most people say that the rectal bioavailabilty is similar or a little better than its oral bioavailability. From Jamshyd's old "Why doesn't ketamine work well rectally?" [thread](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/368797-Why-does-Ketamine-not-work-well-rectally):

NEK is also reported to be ineffective rectally, too, suggesting all three compounds share this property. In any event I would not write off 2-MeO-ketamine because it didn't work well plugged, especially if one has MXE tolerance (which has strong cross-tolerance). I think insufflation or IM injection, like with ketamine, is the way to go if you want decent potency and reliability. I'm not sure if you could easily/safely turn these compounds into their freebase forms in the solution you're planning to squirt up there or if that would definitely increase rectal bioavailabilty or not.

I`m afraid i am writing it off,i also tried it sublingual...The only methods i didn`t try were IV,IM and SUBQ,so maybe it works that way,if that then is the case,for the average researcher thats a load of shit,in general we don`t use these methods for research.


I think the reason that the most reliable,trusted UK vendors didn`t stock this is because they were telling us the truth,it simply doesn`t work for the purpose for which they would be selling it.

so strange... i guess its like one of those like 5meomipt where some poeple get effects and others not. 

i have a friend that gets nothing from 15mg 5meomipt and have read other similar stories.

has anyone tried nasal 200mg+ without effect? i get nothing from oral or sublingual ketamine(never pluged it but have read that its like oral)

It is strange. Last night I insufflated 50 mg of 2-MeO-Ketamine, waited a while, didn't feel much, then snorted 50 more along with 25 mg of MXE plugged, resulting in a much more ketamine-like MXE expererience than usual. Tonight, I plugged MXE, then snorted 100 mg 2-MeO and I'm feeling similarly. 2-Meo-Ketamine is definitely active. This feels much more like ketamine than any MXE experience I've ever had. I suspect the problem is MXE cross tolerance.  Its hard for me to judge because of it.

i tested both nenk and 2meo on their own before trying combos. 2meo is much more stronger, more prononsed effects, very ketamine like and more than 2x times cheaper than nenk, that even with high doses was so-so, there was some dissociation and hints of euphoria kinda ketamine like but definatly not worth the price&doses. 2meo on the other hand i will hopefully be experimenting more in the future

yes i understand you. sory if i am being overly entusiastic but i was waiting for something like that for some time now and this almost hit the spot.

i am puzzled by others reports of inactivity, but they(reports in general positive/negative) are not that many also... so not much can be said at this point i guess. 

i did take magnesium and milk thrisle suplement in the morning before experiments, that could have had some effect but not too much i am sure.

i will report back when i have been trough more experiances, next month probably.

Not really. Regular ketamine synthesis won't yield different ratios of isomers, synthesis that do are very impractical und unlikely to be done in any non-exotic scenario. Usually the synthesis yields a racemic product which means 50-50 ratio (this goes for all substances that have only two isomers like ketamine!), not 70-30 or 15-85 etc, just 50-50. The s isomer will be split up by pharmaceutical companies (a relatively simple process) and the r-isomer will be converted into racemic ketamine again in a separate process. Different companies use different procedures, but this is how it goes down if I'm still up to speed. Isolated r isomer will usually not end up on the street level, since there isn't any medication that contains it in isolated form.


That being said, different batches on the street COULD be resulting from a dealer mixing his racemic with s-isomer in different ratios, but imho that is highly unlikely to be a regular thing and I've never seen any criminological reports suggesting it either. Therefore I conclude that the different ketamine batches you see on the streets these days are either cut with a totally different substance (enough out there, take your pick... MXE (ugh) and tiletamine (YUK!) have been found in street samples) or you are seeing s-isomer vs. racemic ketamine. Also the concentration (assuming it's cut with some inactive substance) can considerably effect the quality of the experience and so can set and setting.

Different ratios of the isomers in street product are still very unlikely, though surely not impossible. Considering how highly sought after ketamine is, this would require a dealer to source both s isomer and racemic ketamine at the same time and not prefer the kicks of being able to offer two different batches over mixing them together. But then if he does mix them, you should see dealers with 4 or 5 different batches (e.g. 60% s, 70% s, 80% s...). Never heard or seen such thing.


Personally, I'd just like to see some plain old phencyclidine again. It's definitely the most kickass dissociative I've ever done (and many times so). I'm at a total loss why it isn't making it's rounds on the street with it's relatively easy synthesis and dissociatives being pretty big nowadays.

Plus, I miss funny news reports of naked people fighting off 5 police officers with a traffic sign that's been hastily ripped out of the concrete by purely primal rage(+pcp) fueled superhuman strength.

Plus2, it would stop all these godamn leeches of rc vendors making money of the low availability of real drugs to internet kiddies. Fucking nasty-ass mxe never deserved 1% of the fame it received.

You definitely find both Isomers on the street in the UK with ketamine, it varies from batch to batch and dealer to dealer and time to time but it definitely happens. I personally love S-Isomer as I find it much better for k-holes. Also ketamine changes in quality quite a lot week to week I find. I've found mixes of racemic and s-isomer also many times I'm pretty sure but you can never tell. 


This substance sounds like pretty shit to me though. The price is ridiculous just buy two grams of ketamine instead with your money and if it's good quality you'll k-hole.

A Did you even read what I said?

B If so, what proof do you have for ever having found the r isomer on the street??


Personally, I can't hole very well with the s isomer, 150mg IM will get me there, but it's not as magical as it is when I inject racemic ketamine. Makes sense considering the whole idea of selling isolated s isomer was to prevent people from experiencing "bad dreams".


Couldn't agree anymore to your last statement, I couldn't agree more. Why is there even a "big and dandy" threat for a substance that seems entirely worthless and pretty much nobody has sampled? I hope you don't need 2g ketamine to hole or were recommending such a dose to anyone in here... It takes about 3-4mg/kg bodyweight for a person to hole when racemic ketamine is administered intranasally. Considerably less for IM and ~2/3 for s isomer. 2g of ketamine should result in something between 8 and 16 breakthrough doses.

Maybe just invest into a dissociative that has proven to actually get you where you want to be, has a solid safety profile (e.g. PCP/Ketamine/DXM even) and which production is controlled by certain industrial standards (the latter 2 in the list, PCP is unfortunately not being administered in clinical settings anymore ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png) ). Why feed those greedy-ass rc vendors while your health and quality of experience takes a hit???

i see... yeah i figured it was an availability issue. couldve saved the question. i suppose its the same down here in germany, i only use the stuff when it flies by (in which case its free). would never pay the ridiculous prices people ask for it, let alone pay for some (cut or not) powder thatll make my nose bleed for days. back when i got to know the substance in 2004, which isnt all that long ago, supply far exceeded demand and when i met people who had it, they usually didnt know what to do with it. even dealers had it laying around sometimes without anyone wanting it. so weird. there also were dirt cheap internet sources. im just glad i had my fun with it back then and dont have to seek out some shady street dealer now that my enthusiasm for it has toned down a bit. im actually kinda glad i dont have a steady source for vials... no explanation needed as to why i am i guess. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

and ye, dxm can be kinda cool, but the side effects are horrible for me in large doses, so i only use it once in a while in doses below 100mg to stop a depression in its roots or to decrease my amp tolerance.


im just wondering... why the hell is there no pcp flooding the black markets?!?!?! while very different from ket, that stuff is so much better than all the other dissociatives ive tried and people would go fucking crazy over it. its basically a gold mine waiting to be rediscovered for dealers/kitchen chemists, yet ive never ever seen it offered anywhere at all locally.

I insufflated 25 mg of this last weekend, just to get a feeler. It really felt a lot like ketamine exept it was maybe ~50% less potent, give or take. 


This weekend I'll try some larger doses, and report back.


Considering it costs half to one third of ketamine were I live it seems actually worth it. It's absolutely active anyway.

I couldn't feel much of 12.5mg racemic ketamine tbh. I don't even I would have during my first trials with racemic k... Either you're extremely light weight or you are actually judging the substance by threshold effects, calling it "worth the money"?

After trying 2-MeO-ketamine a number of times with MXE I've become convinced of a significant qualitative change toward "ketamine-ness" (even though I didn't feel much at 50 mg alone) from MXE alone, and I liked the difference enough to buy a little more. Though I've never used MXE with ketamine, and 2-MeO costs more than I've ever paid for ketamine bought in significant quantaties, with MXE it's more euphoric to me than ketamine at "sub-hole" doses by itself. I can't judge the potency with respect to ketamine because I have an MXE tolerance and the ketamine I have access to I'm saving for when my dissociative tolerance goes down. 


I agree that if someone has a convenient ketamine supply to not bother, and also agree about the rarity of s-isomer ketamine. Ketanest S is the only name brand that I know of that advertises that it's s-isomer. If you're not paying more for it it's almost certainly not s, as it costs substantially more to make whether it's from diverted Ketanest S or custom illicit synthesis.  


Subjective experience is enormously unreliable, especially with a drug that dulls sensation. I personally wouldn't believe I had S unless it both felt different AND came from a supplier with a long and truly impeccable reputation or it said" Ketanest S" on a virgin vial I could match with a company photo. I see no objective reason whatsoever to believe that different companys' ketamine is of different ratios. Everything points to it being all very close to 50:50 S:R, and if it's not 50:50 then it's not a consistent ratio between any individual company's batches (meaning again, effectively, no difference) or else they would advertise it since S is considered more potent and can fetch a higher price. IMO all claims about ratios between brands that are not Ketanest S owe to natural variation in qualitative subjective "propensities" during the time one is in possession of a limited quantity of a certain brand and other times, what dealers say to sell it or jack up the price (or have themselves been told), and expectation bias.


Don't get ripped off.

Then you've had bad ketamine, my freind. 10-15 mg of ketamine is definitely off baseline. it's a small bump and how you take k when you do it recreationaly at clubs and raves, and not to be off your face. Of cause the bumps *very quickly* turns into lines. We all know that.


personaly I never developed any disso tolerance because I always took long breaks between using dissos, and never did them that much.


Yeah, I say it's active because of treshold effects. I thought that was clear from my post. If not I apologize.


I say "worth the money", because regular ketamine is 3 times the price were I live, compared to what I paid for 2-meo-deschloro-ketamine. 


It's probably not worth it if  you live anywere else in europe or US.


That said, There's only one vendor I'd buy it from, and it's not a UK vendor. Know you sources people, because the market is bound to be flooded with fake shit, like when MXE came out.

I have s-isomer ketamine and 10mg is just off baseline but rather subtle. I wouldn't bother with less than 25mg unless I was on something else, and I have no tolerance.

Sure okay, fine. Whatever.


Normaly when I take ketamine I never weigh it out. I just estimate the dose visually. I always start with a small bump and during the night the bumps get bigger and they can sometimes almost be called small lines. But I don't how many mg are in there.


When I took the 2-MDCK I weighed it out on my scale because I wanted to know precisely how much it was. Visually it looked like double of what I would take for starters if it was ketamine, but gave about the same effects.


Which is why I said approximately 50 % the potency. (~ this symbol can be used for approximately, in case somebody don't know)


it should be obvious to any one that this is just my best guesstimate from one very small line.


The point of my post was just to say that it was clearly descernible from baseline for me at that dose! 


Am I making myself clear? 


I bought a gram, so I will be trying some larger lines this weekend. Don't think I'm going to report back though since this thread seems to be full of nitpicky germans.

Wow this seems to have crawled back into the woodwork.  One minute a lot of vendors saying its right around the corner next minute the name of the substance has vanished from their product lists.  Is there a reason for this?  i.e was it found to be illegal/ bunk etc?

I railed 200 mg yesterday. 4 lines in the space of an hour. Actually 2 of them was only spaced apart by 10 minutes.


The funny thing is that it never took of. It was just the same tresold effects as I got from 25 mg 8)


I agree with rising phoenix, 2-methoxy-descloro-ketamine is shit. And no matter how cheap it is, it's stil shit.

I'm sorry I doubted your credibility. I only take ket from pharm sources btw and have definitely never taken any at a rave. ;P I know there are effects off that dose, but surely not enough to judge a substance for it's qualities as a dissociative.

Yes, you're right. I couldn't judge it's qualities as a dissociative from 25 mg.


2-methoxy-ket really is worthless.

I guess there must be a reason [Parke-Davis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parke-Davis) used the name *ketamine* for *ketamine* and not for one of its close analogues. if only we knew about their orginal research... (also see [here](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/594944-The-Big-amp-Dandy-2-MeO-Ketamine-Thread?p=11257863&viewfull=1#post11257863))


anyways, I am really puzzled about the ARC SAR now after ingesting all those compounds... ![:?](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/confused.gif)


EDIT: I have sampled all compounds mentioned, and both NENK and 2-MeO-K seem to be much weaker than regular K. how can it be...?


EDIT2: yes, I am just a poor lab mouse, but I really trust my vendors to have delivered pure samples of all compounds mentioned...

So I became interested in MXE at first because I thought it would be like rolling, but now because it seems like it would be a good opiate alternative and I used to enjoy the occasional bottle of Hydrocodone when I was younger. But since the UK ban MXE seems to be hard to find... **So I have a few questions**: 


1) Is 2-Meo-K the "new MXE"? 


2) What is the dosage like in comparison? 


3) Is 2-meo PURELY a K alternative, or does it have an opium like "buzz". Meaning: Is it at all comparable to the "mellow" felling of morphine? Or the "floaty" feeling of codone? Or the "warm embrace" of dilaudid? (sorry I don't know how to spell "Di-La-Did")


4) What would you say about taking it at a rave?


5) How is it in a setting of 5-15 ppl?

1) Marketing wise, it's supposed to be. Neither is a real gem of a dissociative, but 2-MeO-K seems to be inferior even to MXE.

2) I don't think you can reach full blown dissociation with 2-MeO-K. The threshold is reached at slightly higher dosages than that of MXE, but above that it doesn't seem to have much to offer at all.

3) Imho MXE is even colder than Ketamine. Neither has ever brought on anything I'd even remotely compare to a warm and fuzzy opiate nod. Both get the job done when it comes to escaping reality though. 2-MeO doesn't seem to do so well in that respect either.

4) I'd personally never do it because it would A weaken my memory of the event, B impair my ability to communicate and stay oriented. All dissociatives also makes you look like a total zombie, so if you're paranoid of being checked up by the authorities that might be a minus. In low doses though they can be immensely powerful boosters of both serotonergic empathogens and psychedelics and also stimulants to a lesser degree!

5) I personally have always enjoyed doing full-blown dissociatives in a group. Once you "return to the room" you'll spend some time figuring out whose leg is lying across your chest or the like. :D I strongly doubt 2-MeO-Ketamine would get you anywhere close to such a level of dissociation. It will probably just make it much harder to communicate.


If you're looking for a worthwhile dissociative, try scoring some genuine PCP and smoke dat shit!

I've had trouble finding an answer to my question because there's a lot of mixed up info in this thread (and others on different forums) concerning potency and types of actual ketamine, the genuineness of people's 2-meo-ketamine samples, the naming of this and other similar dissociatives, and various other things... 


So, sorry if it's been answered already. 


**My question:** Does anyone have first hand experience with taking 2-meo-ketamine orally to good (or even just decent) effect? 


I have a fairly large tolerance to MXE, so snorting 2-meo-ketamine is annoying for me. I can't handle 300mg of powder up my nose for very limited effect, and I'd like to try taking it orally because I still have about a gram sitting around. 


I don't mind subtle dissociatives - in fact, I like them very much in certain situations. It's just that, as I said, putting loads of powder in my nose is unpleasant. 


Thanks in advance for any feedback![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

there was one report i think about 500mg orally to no effect. my intiution also says it won't work very well but if you don't what to snort it why not try any way -  your case might be diffrent. You could also try part sublingual/part oral.

Thanks wayab![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


Yep, I think I'll just give it a try and see what happens. 


I've got about 800mg, so I might just try: 


1. swallowing 400mg with water


2. using the other 400mg by making an alcohol solution with as little liquid as possible and holding that shit in my mouth for as long as I can handle 


MXE seems to be getting harder to find so I've dug up the 'bottom of the drawer' stuff (literally the stuff that I've long forgotten about sitting in my bottom drawer) that's been lying around for a while. I found a bit of this and that, and it reminded me of what I liked and loathed about certain dissociatives...  I had a trip down memory lane thinking about the old times with various RCs... 


I actually liked the effects of NENK (or NEK or whatever people eventually decided to call it). Obviously though it would have been the financial death of me if I'd wanted to use it on a semi-regular basis due to its high cost and low potency. 


4-MeO-PCP had its moments, but for some reason I recall having very unpredictable experiences with it (I mean even dosing from the same batch). Some good times, some average times, and some pretty awful times too. 


Anyway, I'll get back on here when my two tests have been done.

you reminded me of this substance and i tested it again today. over all 225mg, first 100mg followed by 125mg(all nasal) 30mins later with a 330ml beer in between lines. i really like this substance. i reminds me very much of ketamine altough its not nearly as good. 

i got hightend apreciation of music, notacible dissociation while still being in the physical world though and that sweet ketamine euphoria. 

it lacks the most profound effects of ketamine like the time dialation and visual aspects and ability to totaly remove you from the world(by itself). 

but i do recall a trip about a month ago that got me k-holing without any ketamine, it was wonderful and it took me to a place i haven't been in years. a true, deep, totaly familiar, totaly alien world that feels just like home in the purest sence of the word but i had to put in the mix quite a bit of substances in high doses to get there: 3meopcp, mxe, nitrous oxide, ah-7921, 5meodmt, n,n-dmt(this dose was very small ~10mg or less) and some cannabis. 

i have mixed these all before and haven't reached a k-hole, so i belive 2-meo-ketamine is responsible for it even though it isn't capalbe by it self(in ok dosages) to achive that. i won't quote doses as they were all very high and such quantities should be avoided but  my tolarence is high( i need 400-500mg ketamine to hole). 

damn if only i could find good old ketamine easier haha, but still its nice to experiment with new stuff risky as it is

Well, I tried the first part of my test, which was 400mg orally (just washed down with water), and got nothing. 


I then decided to give up on trying some sort of half-assed sublingual thing, and just do my best to snort the remaining 400mg in one go. I am not used to snorting large amounts of powder, because the only things I snort are generally RCs which are very active at tiny doses, so it was a gross sensation to have all that shit clogging up my nose. 


Also, I got nothing from that. 


I'm afraid that my MXE tolerance is too high for me to ever get anything out of 2-meo-ketamine. 


So I guess I'm just confirming the most common consensus throughout this thread, which is that the substance is of limited value to most people.

this is very wierd. i am the only one on this forum to get anything it would seem and i have a big tolerance. 

most of my friends that have tested it don't get anything either. but i do have two friend that get more or less the effects that i get. they are novice in dissociative thogh, close to zero tolerance.

yesterday i did another 200mg and wached some movies with a glass of wine. i got a profound sence of significanse to everything even the most insignificant details much like k used to do to me and was kinda half dissociated(when ever i needed to speak or function there was no problem even though before doing it it seemed unlikely).

Can anyone comment on IV administration? I've got a fair amount of experience IVing ketamine, so I imagine this would be similar & most likely less potent. I'm expecting a small (<1g) sample in the next week or so & I plan on shooting it.

Like almost everybody already mentioned in this thread. This compound doesn't work. The highest dose I tried was 200 mg nasally and no effect what so ever. Whereas a similar dose of ketamine would bring me pretty close to a k-hole. Too bad, guess they cannot all be winners.. ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)

Minimal effects even with 300+ mg. Not worth the money (which I know, of course, but just wanted another butterfly to pin to my collection). I think it might be useful for inducing a tiny tiny smidgen of Ketamine-likeness to the experience if combined with some other arylcyclohexamine.

SWIM was given about 850mg of this compound in exchange for a couple of alprazolam tablets. SWIM noted that the nose-clog factor is very high, but his nose never really *hurt*, just became very congested. He said it felt like it took forever to kick in, but this could be due to nasal congestion. 300mg of this compound was enough to put SWIM in that floaty, dreamy space one finds oneself in on a 60mg dose of methoxetamine. He told me that their effects are extremely, incredibly similar. It seemed to him that 2-MeO had more 'sparkle' than methoxetamine, but this could be due to the fact that it was his first time. He says he would do it again, if the prices were to fall below those of methoxetamine. He has a moderate tolerance (and extreme disposition!) to dissociatives.

ok so i know this isn;t very popular one at bluelight but maybe somebody with a bit of chemistry knowledge can help me out.

I just got my order of 2meo from a very trusted EU invite only source that has only gotten me the best quality stuff always. I have ordered from them 2meo already and has always been a slightly off white to tan powder. What I got now is a dark brown powder and I am a bit anxios to try it. I don't think this is a new batch but i cant be sure. 

Is it possible it has degraded? My last order was not even 1/2 year ago and it seems strange to me that I has degraded so fast keeping in mind the stability of ketamine...


Any thoughts ? I did an 1mg alergy test so im just afraid mostly that it can be inactive but contamination is also a big concern...

I ordered recently some MXE from a european source, and it was dark brown and fluffy. It looked very strange. I tried it anyway, took the dosage from 1 mg up to 100 + mg orally to the effect of a huge headache and awful feeling next day (but no high at all). 


Advice is tread carefully. Ended up throwing away my useless stash .

I might have gotten the same batch. 200 mg rectal + 100 mg nasal in combination with 70 mg NEK nasal produced a ~2 hour pleasant drifting, dreamy feeling of rather intense relaxation and dissociation (compared to my earlier experiences with the substance), spent on the bed listening to Moloko. The smell from the powder seems to suggest an unfinished last step in the synthesis procedure - taste was not at all the weak Ketamine-like taste like the last batch from same vendor. So lower purity, but at least seem to have an effect (to the extent that 2-meo-ketamine has an effect).


Ultimately, we don't know until someone run tests on it or do a wash on it or something.

yeah i risked it and tried it and was active. maybe ~20% loss of potency if i have to guess. so maybe its 95% pure? who knows...


that aside i had a great trip with it! a quasy-k-hole that i love very much. ive achieved it two times before. the first two times i added also 10mg nasal 5meodmt& a double nitrous baloon to the mix and didn't take any etizolam. 

this time i used 100mg mxe oral + 50 mg ah7921 sublingual + 5mg 3meopcp + 0.5mg etizolam and 600mg 2meoketamine(first 200 then 400 all nasal)


its a crazy combination i know and don;t recomend it to anyone but being so much in love with ketamine and it being so hard for me to find in the last few years i somehow found this combination wich works great to me. its not a full blown k-hole its more like when you start to get out of the hole and begin to remebre bit by bit who, what, when and where you are. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) fun times 


I guess the etizolam takes the stimy aspect of the mxe out, the ah7921 gives the warm feeling, mxe and 3meopcp the general disociation and finaly the 2meoketamine is the spice that makes it all happen. I wouldn;t advice anyone to try it thouhg as it does not sound particulary healthy combo. quite expensive too haha .

Such a shame.... Came as dark tan powder, at first I thought they screwed up and sent 5-APB as they look identical. Except this smells faintly of K. I'm guessing the purity is not up to scratch judging by the colour. But what I can tell you is that it is very.. frustrating.


After dosing 200mg x2 via IM it almost felt like something was about to happen.. and then it just fizzled out. It is incredibly short acting. Definite anaesthetic effect at the site of injection. And much like coco pops.. it turns the milk really chocolatey!

Not really, the water goes muddy brown.. hardly very encouraging but none the less it does *something* atleast. Albeit not much. If you are looking for magical journeys a-la-ketamine/mxe.. then steer clear. If you've never done dissociatives before then you may have something better to say about it. But I'd advise you to forget this in a and get some real K (difficult as that is for some of us right now).


Disappointment factor 10/10

Don't really know why I got my hopes up. Oh well, there's some money wasted just to say I've tried it.

I got a gram of 2-MeO-K, prolly from the same vendor wayab used, my shit was a fine, tan powder.  Upon insuffulation, it smelled a lot like chlorine.  I prolly snorted half and ate half in a 4hr period, mixing in 5-MAPB and EPH.  All I got from the 2-MeO-K was a vague threshold effect, no dissociation at all.  In fact, when I mixed the same amount of 5-MAPB (200mg) with 250mg DXM, the effect was easily 2-3x better.  I do have a dissociative tolerance, and I don't even consider taking 250mg DXM to equal drug use.  I will not be buying 2-MeO-K again.

I wonder if the magic is actually with the 2-Hydroxy substitution, rather than 2-Methoxy.  3-Hydroxy and 4-hydroxy PCP are both supposedly very active, with the 3-hydroxy group conferring opioid properties.

Don't think many people can recommend 2-MeO. 


I'm afraid I agree with this:

In fact, I'd extend that to shittest drug of any sort. It just didn't seem to produce anything at all dose - well, I stopped after taking half a gram orally and attempting to snort 400mg which was hard going indeed. 


If more is required than that then what's the point. I can't afford something which starts getting active at over half a gram of near pure powder.

Mixing serotonin releasers like 5-MAPB with DXM is VERY dangerous, you can easily cause serotonin syndrome which can be lethal.

Lacking is being too kind, really. I snorted a couple of 100 mg lines and then binned the rest of my gram. The effects simply wasn't worth the effort.

Oooh ok, anyway hopefully I'll only have 1 gram so it's OK, not a big waste.... I'll try it as soon as I received it :D

I'm also wondering if someone got likely pure product (not like some who received dark-colored powder with a strong smell indicating unfinished synthesis or degradation) and went the IV or IM route. Besides impure product it could be that snorting and swalling are simply not efficient ROA for this, would like feedback from someone who injected.

But I would like to see ketamine used in the hospital wards for people suffering from depression and anxiety. I can't see that coming. So we get nothing from magical antidepressant qualities of ketamine**. Just like marihuana, it's the public enemy number 1 in my country after one party stated they would try to depenalize at least possessing amounts for one's own use (too bad they don't mention how many diseases can be cured or helped in some way with it, they don't quote any scientific journals - that would help a lot of people against it understand it's actually them who is wrong about marihuana; and they're wrong about most psychoactive substances). Another promising antidepressant (or rather its derivatives) is buprenorphine, it worked wonderful for me, it lifted my mood during the period I used it and it was something totally unlike dirty feeling one gets from SSRIs.

Eventually you're tapered off one shitty (S)(D)(N)RI to be transferred to another shitty one. This generates so much money because these drugs are expensive. In reality even when you compare the synthesis of ketamine or Bentley compounds with the syntheses of any of these novel (S)(D)(N)RIs, you see it costs less to synthesize the former. Buprenorphine synthesis - no refined substrates.

I am quoting this post from way back in the 3rd page and I've not read the later pages of this thread so I'm unsure Anyone responded to this point but I wanted to address this as while I understand your skepticism, I am very happy to report to that you are quite wrong on this point.


I'm not sure if you live in the US and are commenting on the US medical system/pharma industry, but I am a 2nd year resident in psychiatry and you will be surprised and happy to hear that ketamine and it's derivatives are very actively being not only researched, but actively used in a variety of clinical settings to treat refractory major depression.  The hospital where I am doing my residency treats several patients a week who suffer from depression refractory to conventional treatment with ketamine infusions with great success.  And while this practice is not yet mainstream, my hospital is certainly not the only medical facility that is using ketamine for this purpose.


Additionally Johnson and Johnson is seeking approval and patent for their "version" of ketamine in the form of a nasal spray indicated for treatment of depression.  Now of course ketamine is an ancient drug and therefore J&J cannot make any money with ketamine in its current form...but they aren't letting a little problem like that stand in their way of turning a nifty product- they have simply separated the racemic mixture of ketamine and are patenting the isolated S enantiomer of ketamine and giving it the incredibly unimaginative name, Esketamine (get it.... S-ketamine).


And this is not some Hail Mary that won't make it to market for another decade if ever, all indications are this nasal spray form of ketamine will likely be available for psychiatrist like me to prescribe within the next year, 2 at the latest.  


Another positive that will result from J&J's introducing Esketamine to the market as a treatment for depression, is not to be outdone, several of the other big pharmas are already developing their own NMDA antagonists similar to ketamine to get some of this newly formed market share.  


Now the one thing you may not like about all of this, but I actually agree with, is these new drugs like the nasal spray Esketamine will almost certainly not be available for guys like me to just write a script for it which would allow u to run down to cvs and pick up your own personal bottle of nasal spray ketamine.  It looks like these drugs will only be made available for inpatient usage, and again, as libertarian as I am, I still think it's a good idea to keep it relegated to supervised, impatient usage.  


My reasoning for this position is this- patients w major depression respond dramatically, and almost instantly to these ketamine infusions (for many pts this remission only lasts a few days, but it is a profound response).  As you could imagine, sending a pt who suffers from major depression home with a big bottle of ketamine and telling him to only use it X number of times per week or month is just not gonna work.  We have developed treatment protocols/dosage scheduling which have proven to be effective, while minimizing the abuse potential.


It would simply be too much to expect of a pt with major depression to say, "here's a giant bottle of ketamine, now I know it relievs your depression almost instantly, but only use it every other day for the first 2 weeks, then once a week for the next month, the. Twice a month for the next 3 months etc".  Take a depressed pt and send him home w a bottle of an abusable druf that provides instant relief and there's just no way he could stick to the treatment schedule.

Nay, I thought it was really vile - made me feel very dirty and the trip was pretty cold and not even that interesting (although at the time I had general disso tolerance)... so never used it again after that, not worth the nasty feeling that ruined everything.


Not really that different from the dirty feeling of DCK but less similar to that of DXM... although with DCK it's also a matter of dosage, it seems fine at lower doses but I need a higher one to get something satisfying out of it.

With this 2-methoxy version I didn't take too high a dose mind you..


I wonder if the 3-methoxy version is any better.. oh wait that is MXM right? so yeah better I hear.

Yeah the ban is really disappointing and hopefully we will see it finding its way on the black market, perhaps it takes a little time for the demand to find the supply... for the networks to be set up etc..


I was very happy to find out today I am getting some scrapings of 500 mg MXE this saturday, and 2g K (not sure if S-isomer, possibly) will probably keep me happy for time to come.


I was forced to get rid of my 2-meo-ket and other dissociatives a while back, otherwise I would have kept it simply because I like collecting stuff..

A group of acquintences from the UK told me this. I have had some baggies from different sources, some really felt like S-isomer and less congestion, but most felt like the reports I read in this thread.


Maybe I'll order another baggie from the shady K for proper testing. I tested it with a EZ-test kit for ketamine (mandelin) and the colour of the chemical remained yellow, only a little bit darker than before... Ketamine should get orange, according to their booklet. ([https://www.eztest.com/product/ez-test-for-ketamine-pmapmma-amphetamine-and-ecstasy/](https://www.eztest.com/product/ez-test-for-ketamine-pmapmma-amphetamine-and-ecstasy/)) So my guess is it could be methoxyketamine going around these days, maybe mixed with a little bit of S-isomer ketamine...


Does anybody know of a proper testing lab where I could sent a bit of material to? ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Why would it be methoxyket? As far as i know the cinese stopped making this quite a long time ago. I would figure that shady k would be DXE, just because there is alot of it right now and it looks pretty muh the same a k. So i would figure peeps are pushin that. 

Use your regents and kess us know if it indeed methoxyk or probably just deschloroketamine. Imho

Reagent test was negative for ketamine, though it felt much like it. Deschloroketamine acts way too long for it to be that. I could almost hole on this shady k, but not quite. Also effects wore out faster than ketamine (especially after getting tolerance). The only way to make sure is to get a sample of it to a proper lab somewhere, I guess.
