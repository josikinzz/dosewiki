**Since this is an analogue of MDA and is likely to exert similar action to the MDxx compounds, you should treat this like MDxx and avoid doing this too frequently. Here at Bluelight we often advise "the one month rule", taking a break of at least one month between uses, and this would fit well with 6-APB too.**

No vendor talk please, seems to be common in these B&D threads, but it will not be tolerated. You have been warned.


**--- From the previous thread ---**


Following is a copy from a list in the 6-APB Temp Sticky Thread, it is quite old and you may have different ideas about these effects which were collected with preliminary bioassays with "benzo fury" products.


**Hi there PD,


as you might know there is a massive amount of chatter involving the compound 6-APB (and also 6-APDB) being generated and it is consequentially difficult to get a sensible idea about where we are all standing with it.


That is why we mean to gather every piece of evidence and considerably valuable posts here, so that not every single person has to go data-mining through a lot of junk. Of course, we have to be selective so you can always still go through it if you have specific questions.**


[starting here myself, mods kindly create your own post to work in, at some point we may merge and even reorganize into *evidence and *other valuable posts, perhaps otherwise constructed we'll see]


- could not find an ADD thread about it, am I blind?

- currently working in: *The 6-APB thread v. Is full of dummies* from back to front. Got to page 35 (half).


Distilled generalizations:


From: [The 6-APB thread v. Is full of dummies](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/showthread.php?t=516433)


It seems mostly subjective experiences are posted here between (sometimes saddening) social chatting and many

have the same product which *seems* to be 6-APB, with corresponding effects reported that could fit the bill.

A marquis reaction at least one user did was also affirmative.

However analysis of this product is not expected to be readily forthcoming, also there is inconsistency in the mass of

the big pills / pellets and there might be a general spread in the material as well. This in part would account for the

variation in reactions, then again it might not mean anything at all. The following was distilled from the many posts:


*(effects profile updated 30/11/11 with some changes based on more evidence from experiences etc. I suspect the conflicting reports are due to a lot of other chemicals being sold as 6-APB - Jesusgreen)*

**Duration:**


Note: highly variable and needing more datapoints


*Onset: 45 (or less) -120 mins

Comeup + Plateau: 5-10 hours

Comedown: 4-6 hours

Residual Effects: ?*

**

Possible effects described:**


- Visual augmentation rather than distortion - visuals / distortion are possible though (probably at larger doses?) and likened to the visual effect higher doses of MDMA produce.
- Noted music appreciation, an effect reported remarkably often (from limited info)
- Long, drawn out i.e. dilated experience
- Empathogenic, mildly entactogenic
- Euphoria, though not noted by everyone - Seems to have more quality than superficial stimulants
- Rushing feelings or "waves", ranging from absent to strong
- Apparently not notably 'fiendish'


**Other notes:**


- Not everyone is appreciative of the enhancing effects
- Some find it comparable to MDMA, although significantly less 'hard'
- Others find it quite unlike MDMA or MDA
- Unreliable stimulant effects and euphoria
- It seems that compared to mdma: more side-effects for your euphoria and other expected positive effects
- Not feeling particularly toxic, but still somewhat dirty (consistent with other opinions)
- Most reports seem to indicate significant pupil dilation, however some people only notice slight dilation or none at all. Likely to be dose relevant.


**Possible side-effects:**


- Generally not *terribly* stimulant-like side effect but still there! (high heartrate / bloodpressure), tightness in chest
- Sweating
- Nystagmus
- Dry mouth, seems to absord water from the body like chemically comparable substances
- Pronounced bruxism, jaw tension, grinding
- Warm extremeties / mild parasthesia or tingling, another user gets cold extremeties rather than warm, trouble regulating body temperature like MDMA produces? But due to stimulant effects more chance of overheating than hypothermia.
- Some jitteriness
- Wobbly walking / rubbery legs.
- Difficulty urinating
- Possible nausea / emesis (vomiting)
- Some experience headaches (possibly due to dehydration and/or overheating and/or harmful metabolites or even 6-APB toxicity)
- Insomnia, long duration even longer problems sleeping
- Crashing and washed out feeling hard to predict but definitely to be expected in higher or more frequent assays.
- Some experience diarrhoea the day or two after use.


I appreciated this description by Invert:

Feel sedate, subjectively, in a way that's familiar to me from methylone and mdma; i.e. not objectively sedated, but the pleasure feels sedate, as it were. Not so mild as to be doubtable, as far as I'm concerned, but not so strong as to be overwhelming.

Great summary Jesus. The key themes for me are subjectivity and lack of data points. Just to put a different perspective on the description by Invert: for me, this substance is extremely psychedelic. At low doses - 70 - 100mg, I get into a nice trippy head space, cartoon like CEVs and some minor OEVs. This is in addition to the MDMA like feelings I experience. It is certainly not as 'pure' feeling as MDMA but it does come with the extra psychedelic effects.


However, get this up to doses of 200 - 350 mg (certainly not recommended for all - or anyone) and things get crazy. Constant OEVs - fractals, geometric shapes, warping etc. etc. At such doses, the drop off from peak is extremely jittery. For me, redosing works and actually increases the effects of the initial doses. This can include redosing as much as 6 hours after the initial drop. You do pay for redosing after the peak. An etizolam or some such substance will probably be required to help get you back to earth.

Is there any crosstolerance between 2c-c and 6apb? I am going to a festival for two days  and i thought of taking 2c-c on the first and 6apb on the second day.

What do you think?

I don't think so, besides that if you're usually experiencing 6-APB psychedelic effects, they may be nullified. 


Also I have two questions for you guys: what do you think of 6-APB/5-APB combo alone at home? Do you enjoy it? What are your activities? 


Second question is: can you eat on 6-APB? Eg. pizza? I've never tried.

Thanks.

I tried it once. Pure bliss. I could not stop listening to music  for 7 hours,it was awesome:D The combo is much better then either substance alone, much better euphoria.

I could not eat anything for 10 hours.

How does redosing on this work? I felt a little overwhelmed taking 100mg at once and I'm afraid in a new setting (music festival) I will feel uncomfortable. Would splitting the dose into 50mg capsules provide the same amount of euphoria, but in a slower way, if I take one then the other a little later? I would not mind if this elongated the duration.

i cant understand ppl dosing in the 200+mg range


I find 80mg 2x split 2-2.5 hrs has a good *maybe* psychedelic trip (synthnoids intensify the trippy effects 10x)


I weigh give or take 190 lbs


I recently took 110mg in a single drop and the comeup had me feeling like a zombie, i was rolling so hard i had to walk it off for 40 mins before entering the club, afterwards it was the extreme euphoria i've become used to, but that comeup was rough, it was a weird "cloudy feeling" I had some swirling and tracing visuals, and mad visual static (i typically have visual static anyway)


i think 150mg would knock my socks off, and i have tolerance

How is the headspace on this? I have tried only a few entactogenic compounds (methylone and 4-FA) and I absolutely love them. However, psychedelics give me rather intense anxiety. In particular, the dissociation I get from them is what I do not like. The thought loops, introspective thinking, I can do without all of that. I recently tried 4-FA after a long break from entactogens (please forgive me if this is the incorrect term!) and loved that my head was totally clear -- I was able to think rationally, was not confused at all, felt very grounded in reality, etc. 


I have read much of 6-APB threads and from I gather, the psychedelic effects are more constrained to visuals rather than headspace -- particularly when the doses are kept low. Would this be an accurate assessment?

Yeah, I find the psychedelic effects of 6-apb to be light visuals at best, that being said I've never gone over 150mg and from what I've read 200 is where it becomes more pronounced.

Yep, 200 is a very strong dose, not to be recommended for all. At 200 + I have constant OEVs - patterns, warping, people's faces are very interesting - when people blink I can see eyes on their eye lids. Also the CEVs can get quite intense. Certainly not of the detail of LSD but very cartoon like and vivid.


Body load and euphoria are amazing. 


All depends on what you're after. I only do this once every few months so I prefer to push quite hard. However, if I were looking for a more relaxed experience, anything from 70 - 100 is lovely. 


For me, redosing actually boosts the effects rather than prolonging things. A recent festival experience was very interesting. Redosed after 6 hours and was taken well past my previous peak and beyond. For 20 minutes or so things were rather difficult but beyond that, it was pretty spectacular. 


Again, as I've noted, you do pay for redosing. Really boosts the stimmy ending. Things can get very jittery and coming to a stop is very challenging.


Edit: As for body weight as a measure of tolerance, I see it as a vital factor. However, it is extremely subjective. My friend weighs in excess of 200lbs and needs at least 300 of 6 to get anywhere. As noted above, jerseybrah takes much less than this and is rolling all over the place. I weigh about 62ish kgs and between 150 and 200 is my magic number. I really think physical fitness plays a part. When I was extremely fit, I could roll hard off much less. My fitness has dropped off over the last 6 months and now I need more. I leave a good gap between rolls so I hope it isn't a tolerance issue. However, as with most substances, the first one tends to hit you the hardest.

Don't redose. I've found redosing on APBs drastically increase amphetamine psychosis on comedown, while with no redosing there's no psychosis at all.

I've never felt any kind of amphetamine psychosis after redosing 6. The most I've redosed was 150mg and I redosed twice with that amount. The second redose was pointless, just gave me some stimulation. My mind was calmer after that, than say a night and a day on coke or amphetamine salts. The biggest problem with redosing is the two day wait to feel normal again. The after effects are pretty rough with 6. These include lethargy, aches and pains, and apathy. Plus maybe some lingering visual static, but I don't mind that. Gives me something to watch as I try to sleep for the next few nights.

Yeah, the lethargy can be annoying. However, with the amphetamine psychosis, it's not just me who has trialed with 6-APB with and without redosing. It's other people, too. My after-effect-apb psychosis got reduced dramatically the second time I dropped APB (also with redosing), but tbh i wouldn't risk redosing again. It lasts enough time already and the possible psychosis is just not worth it.

So some people are saying redose, some are saying not to...anyone else want to weigh in on this? 


I like the euphoria of taking 100mg at once, but it just comes on a little intense for me.

^ Redosing is mainly a concern if you're taking high doses. 50mg + 50mg redose isn't going to cause much in the way of side effects, imo possibly even less than 100mg in one go, but at the same time, redosing I find is not that effective. 150mg + 100mg redose was not much more effective than 150mg, but had more side-effects. 


I'd expect something similar, and imo if you found 100mg too much I'd just drop to 80mg and work down further if necessary, 50mg + a 50mg redose would probably be no better than 60-70mg, use more material, and provide similar side-effects to 100mg.

How steep is the dose-response curve for this? Ie. How different is 90 from 100mg? 80 from 90? 


I would test out the perfect dose for me but the fest is already next week so I can't take it again before then.

I would like to know about that also.. I dose the compounds that i dont have much experience with rather low, and like Axed i am planning to take this on a festival next week and i don't want to be underwhelmed. Say my sweet spot is 100 mg, would 85 be too underwhelming or 110 too much ?


I can also combine this with 5-apb as both are under my possesion, would you suggest to go solo with 6-apb or a combo for a music fest, and at what ratio should i go for the combo?

For me, 6-APB has a fairly predictable dose-response curve. Increments of 10mg seem to increase the effects but not to an unmanageable level. As you build beyond the 100mg range, those 10mg increments seem to get more telling and hit harder. It will depend on your own tolerance levels and such but for me, the difference between 85 and 110 is noticeable but not to the extent that I can't cope. First time I took 6, I tried 100. It was enough. 


In a festival setting, you'll not want a super strong dose as the desire to dance and have fun may well be overwhelmed by the substances psychedelic properties. 


The best experience I've had on a night out was to start on 5-APB and move onto 6-APB. I took them at a ratio of 1:1. That was because I had a weak batch of 5-APB. If you have a good batch, you'll need much less 5-APB. I'd probably dose in a ratio of 1 part 5-APB to 1.5 parts 6-APB. The 5-APB provided the energy to get the evening going and the top-up of 6-APB made everything go trippy but it didn't overwhelm my desire to dance. 


On another occasion, with a potent batch of 5-APB, 30mg was strong enough to blow 150mg of 6-APB out the water. It was a lovely feeling but it overpowered the trippiness of the 6-APB.


So, at a festival I would take, for example, 100mg of 5-APB followed at T + 3 by 200mg of 6-APB. You can of, course, drop them together. If I were to do that, I'd probably go for a maximum of 200mg, probably 50mg of 5-APB and 150 of 6-APB. Or adjust the ratio to your taste.

I've heard a good dose ratio for 5+6 apb combo is 50/60 or 50/70

150mg 6 feels to me like 2 x 100mg. I do my 5 and 6 combos at 100mg 5, 150mg 6. Be careful, I'm a hard head with entactogens.

Don't have any re-uptake inhibitors like ethylphenidate before 6-apb. Most of the effects from the 6-apb are completely gone, accept stimulation and mild motivation. Feels like I'm on crap speed.

I had about 150mg max ethylphenidate earlier over about a 5 hour period, last 30mg of that was probably 5 hours ago?

Will see how it goes, nothing special to report yet.


Edit: All seems well :D maybe i had left enough time in between.


Now im seeing why the night i did 250mg is all a funny blur.

Well I guess it would depend on how long you want to be on it. A buddy of mine split 200mg in 4 caps spread over about 6 hours. Never had that intense or a roll, yet it lasted almost 15 hours. Not fun. Unless that is your thing I suppose. I like to peak hard and then come down and be over with it. This lasts way longer then MDxx for me so when its done im done.

I did 140mgs split into 2 70mg caps taken a hour apart this past Friday (the 13th). I spilt the dose to avoid puking,as that`s what normally happens when I take 6-apb. I want to say that the powdered batch I have was nowhere near as good as the original pellets I ordered from 2010. 


I took this dose about 3 hours before I went to go see Weezer play live out doors. Although I had fun I wasn`t really blown away. Before the show I had a hard time walking,not impossible but I had to focus on not stumbling. I was grinding my jaw a bit(I chipped a tooth),I also had no appetite and stayed up till about 5 am even after having more than a few beers after the show. In all,I had a fun time but it was much less intense than what I remembered it to be.

hmm. i guess it`s brown. it has a pancake mix type quality to it and it stick to the end of my knife when ever i try to weigh it out. i think i bought it back in febuary if that helps at all. this is also the same batch i`m having problems plugging,it doesn`t seem to work.

I guess we have the same batch, i bought mine in march and the off white last week.

That s the thing i hate in the RC scene. It doesn t matter if a vendor has a good rating, they can always have some products of bad quality, you never know.

Will waiting around a month reduce tolerance to this chem significantly?, I have been using the branded "Benzo Fury" variety for a while dosing usually half a pill but have found recently that I have comedown much quicker after weekly use of this product which I have now stopped. 


I have also recently bought a new RC brand "Disco Biscuits" which I cannot find any information about, The stupid name should have put me off and I'm too cautious to try it myself despite positive reactions from friends.

I have not, but my girlfriend once did, roughly 80mg i believe, she gets headaches from 6-apb and wanted to see if a lower dose would not give her one. She was completely underwhelmed and disappointed, not worth it imo. Then again that was in the home setting, a festival where your already excited and high off the music might be another story. I'd aim for a higher dose and go bananas though, that is just me

There is no mindfuck with this one, no need for benzos. It s an entactogen with some mild visuals. I would dose at 

least 120 mg or 150 mg which is my perfect dose, because with 70 mg you will feel very little euphoria.

2 things:

anyone tried doing something creative on this thing? music to be exact, if so how was it?


about re-dosage: i'm gonna be getting 250mg. plan is to score 125mg and go out. now, knowing myself when I comeback I'll want to do the rest and play video games or whatever. so what would be the best way to-redose the remaining 125mg? just do everything or maybe something like 60+65?


crash/comedown is a non-issue as I have weed/wine/benzos (yay) and 3 days off (yay).


(did 6-apb 2 times before, last time around 3 months ago so i've basically 0 tolerance to this or anything similar)


thx;p

I love messing with my turn tables on 6. Music is the greatest.


As for redosing, I'd take the 125mg at once. With the tolerance build up, splitting the redose up will probably just extend the residual stimulation. I've found 125mg redose perfect to extend the roll, and maybe even intensify the experience.

I'd say yes, too much use and the magic will disappear. I find it extremely similar to mdma in that respect. I also find the come down and after effects to be worse than mdma, which keeps me from eating too much 6. 


As for redosing, IME the same dose as the initial should be fine, as long as you don't wait too long to take it. 8 hours after your first dose, and you'll probably need an increase due to tolerance.

Serotonin depletion would be my only concern. I've done them in the same week with no problems. Maybe just a small case of the Monday blues. Maybe you'll just need some extra 6 to get you where you need to be.

Suppose that instead one took a modest dose (perhaps 10-15 milligrams) of d-amphetamine at the 6 hour mark. Assumingly it entails milder but similar concerns of neurotoxicity as would simultaneous ingestion of the two, but do you reckon it would prolong rather than boost the effects, as opposed to taking more 6-apb? I'm thinking it would most likely rekindle some of the euphoria and speediness, but possibly be smoother and less jittery? 


In any case, I'm planning to take 6-apb tomorrow so maybe I'll try the d-amp boost and post the results!

Just to add in my two pence on this. Recently, I took an initial dose of 6-APB and then redosed 6 hours into the experience. My redose was two-thirds of my initial dose. After only 30 minutes I sky rocketed past my first peak and had a very crazy time. I only take this stuff every 6 weeks or so (if that) but it was a surprise that the redose hit so hard, particularly after 6 hours. Maybe an extra couple of hours would have made a difference. 


Again, as I've noted, redosing works will for me but it comes with a price and things start getting very jittery towards the end of the experience.

Had the same experience the very first time with 6-APB. I bombed 125mg on empty stomach, and by reports it loaded one to two hours. So when I came to party, it was about 2 hours 45 minutes after bombing, feeling very little. So I've dropped another 125mg bomb. It was mistake and bliss at the same time. After 15 minutes or so, I felt exactly like you - peak appeared and I felt like I was skyrocketing even higher, then I remembered I've just dropped ANOTHER 125mg... good times

roughly 125mg of very high quality 4-fa, this was also with a 6 week break of any releasers too. I though because 4-fa is a light releaser of serotonin and mostly dopamine that I'd be fine, but apparently amphetamine the days coming up to a roll can make it very weak. Guessing this is the case with 4-fa due to the chemical similarity.

I gotta agree with the comedown/hangover being harsher on 6-apb than MDMA or MDA. Keeps it from being fiendish for me for sure. I love the experience but after each session dont even want to think about it for a couple weeks. With MDMA I could easily abuse on a regular weekend basis, with anticipation throughout the week.

Again, feedback is so subjective. I find come-downs on MDMA so much harder to deal with than 6-APB. 6-APB feels like a walk in the park. I do feel much more tired and stripped of energy with 6 than I do with MD but I don't get the blues at all. 


I've found that a gap of at least 6 weeks between experiences keeps things good. Also, I exercise regularly, eat healthy and pre- and post-load before and after the experience. Working hard is another important aspect between trips / rolls. The harder I work, the more I feel I deserve the experience. 


I never feel like I want to take things again for a good month. I always have so many lessons driven home to me during trips that I just don't have the time to integrate them all without waiting for a sufficient period in between.


Edit: In fact, I'm gearing up for my next experience as we speak. Does anyone else get excited in anticipation of taking 6, or anything else for that matter? I know this sounds extremely childish, but in the weeks leading up to D-Day, I start finding it harder and harder to sleep - just because of excitement.

So whats the deal with IV 6-apb? I know that alot of people say its dirty and the labs are putting out an impure product and all this. But say that some one has a fairly pure product and wants to try this route out. 


Has any one else went with the ROA? If so how was it? I havent found much info on it.

**Patterns of use/effect over the past 2 years.**


Hmm. With me it's love and hate. I binge once every couple of months. Maybe 2g over a week. I work and function OK. Wife unable to tell, well, unable to differentiate from my usual stoned persona. We actually have some great conversations with 6APB as my personal secret catalyst.

But, on the morning after, my body aches. The thigh and calf muscles particularly (I'm  postal worker - it can be a bit of a bitch for physical graft).I force myself to eat properly and supplement with tryptophan or 5htp.


 I notice my immune system weakens after such binges. Lymph nodes, tonsils etc are tender/inflamed and I usually contract some kind of *'Manflu' *as the wife calls it.

Mentally, the aftermath is inconsistent. About a week afterwards I become emotionally sensitive, but not in a bad way necessarily. A kind of solemn melancholy seems to grip me for a day or two, so that small gestures of kindness will bring a lump to my throat, or a particular news story of human tragedy will draw painfully intense empathy from me. I gather my wits for a week or so, noting a frustrating slowness of mind that lifts by a week or so.

Short term effects seem negligible (spoken as a reasonably informed but in no way expert enthusiast). The possible longterm effects are, as yet, unknown. The data for longterm effects of MDMA may soon be coming in. Instinct tells me, crudely based on the physical and mental effects of both materials being similar, the processes they alter are not far removed. The stresses which play on these systems that are altered might be comparative in their longterm prognoses.


These are the gambles we take. I guess everyone has their way of getting round this seemingly risky game.

For me it's the creative headspace and drive that I find for a few hours, when I create music on my Cubase system or guitars etc. I can't get enough of that set/setting.

When I hit the end of the bag, there is sadness tinged with relief. I read my body well enough to stay well clear for a while. It's only when I forget how rough I've felt that the stuff starts to worm it's way back into my feebly weak mind. 

I gotta confess. This weekend is one such binge occasion and I have just taken a break from playing my bass intensly for some time. Great fun!

Take care with empathogens such as this. They can become very compulsive sometimes. Peace - Pipp

yeah its kind of like flour. take 115-120mg (no tolerance) and smoke a bit or weed. gotta weigh it though because the dose/response curve is steeper than mdma

If you just ate and then took your dose, then no wonder why you ain't feeling that much. Next time try 150mg on 3 hours of fasting.

well it was a nice experience id say the peak was about 1.5 hours in and lasted about 2 hours after that 


so total about 5 hours after i took it i felt like i was coming down


it was a good experience but i guess my expectations might of been too high


would yall recommend taking a step back and dosing 100mg next time or just bumping it up to 200mg? either way next time i wont eat for more then 3 hours before hand where as previously i ate about 1.5 hours before


oh and i cant smoke weed cuz im on probation but i do think that woulda made things better

Normally I'd say don't jump straight up to 200mg. I find after around 150mg dosing more does increase the pleasurable effects but nowhere near as much as it increases the side-effects and comedown/hangover.


I'd also normally say to go for 150mg again next time, but to take it on an empty stomach this time though. 


Most reports I've heard of white 6-APB were lower quality, and one particular friend obtained some white 6-APB from the same place several times and received different potencies every time, needing anywhere from 150mg to 400mg+. 


With this in mind I'd say take 200mg next time, but no higher. If the 6-APB is high quality then this is a bit more than you should need but you're not into dangerous dose territory - and if the 6-APB is lower quality it should be just enough to kick it up a notch. Just make sure you don't mix it with any other drugs as your heart rate will be raised significantly at this dose if it is relatively high purity. Also take it on an empty stomach if you want stronger effects and a quicker come up ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


Also it's worth mentioning, that this should be treated like MDA and MDMA - dosing frequently will lead to long term loss in effects, and possible neurotoxicity. Keep it to once a month at most. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

150mg of 6-APB the day after taking 125mg 4-fa was amazing, but still a little overwhelming, as I found it the first time. Seeing the Black Keys perform while on this was incredible though. Once I got past the comeup, my nausea dissipated and I know this is cliche but I could feel the music. Only sad part was that it made the set pass by waaay too fast, and my eye wigglies were too strong to focus on the stage for more than a few seconds at a time. Fantastic stuff, although I feel like I have yet to find my perfect dose level for this chem.

Yeah it should have cross tolerance to all of those, especially MDMA. You need to wait a very long time after doing anything similar.

Do you get any effect when you double the dose ?


Also is it long since you took MDMA before you tried the 125mg 6-APB.

If you use 6-APB too soon after say MDMA then yeah, serotonin depletion is gonna be a factor and you'll have diminished effects. Standard advice here is leave a month between serotonergic drugs of any description, though I've found I can get full effects leaving a smaller gap than that. Fortnightly's fine for me, weekly starts taking its toll very quickly.


I do seem to be less sensitive to its effects than many here, and need to dose high to get what i want from it even with a long gap between repeats, and typically aim for 250mg in a single dose. I wouldn't advise you double up and jump straight to 250mg yourself all the same. Try an extra 50 mg next time. IME stepping from 100mg > 150mg > 200mg and seeing where that gets you each time should be ok. 150mg is not so much stronger than 100mg as to suddenly get to be too much. It's pretty forgiving in that respect IMO but the difference each extra 50mg brings is noticeable.

Does anyone know how long 6-APB can keep for. Just I got some and by the time I use it I will have had it some time. I suppose also this question is relevant for anyone wishing to stock up in case a ban comes in.


Would it lose its potency after a certain period of time. Would be interested to hear your comments.

^Don't quote me on that but I'd think it's the same as with most drugs.. just put it in 3-4 closed bags in freezer with no light and it should stay OK for many years.. but nobody will tell you how long is gonna survive a benzofury pill laying on a desk with lots of oxygen and daylight.

My 6-APB has came in the post, although will not be able to try till the end of next week. Just have few concerns, as have read from other forums that 6-APB has totally messed them up. I read about one guy who just took 100mg and it like left him in a nervous wreck for a month afterwards. Anyone on here find this.


I ordered myne from two different online companys. Now I understand that we can't name vendors on here but I feel I would feel better about taking myne if at least knew if the vendors I bought from are safe. I am from the UK, so I was wondering could I send someone a personal. message with the two vendors I bought from to see if they are legit. Just like to know if someone else bought from them also.


Cheers.

Is it just me, or is this stuff deceptively light and fluffy? I just capped some and .1g takes up like 3x the space in the cap as molly. I don't trust my pos scale so I thought I'd double check so make sure I'm not taking too much inadvertently. Looked like a big pile for just 100mg.

My batch of 6-apb is at least 2 or 3 times fluffier than my 5-apb. 100mg 6  takes up more than half a capsule. 100mg 5 takes up about 1/3 of the capsule. And I have older brown stuff.

Got some benzo fury pellets in the mail, took one and was not disappointed in the least.


4 hours of pleasant stimulation, and stronger than MDMA euphoria, then another 3 hours of completely unique visuals and no trouble sleeping.


Have I found an alternative to MDMA?

I'd say the intensity was about equal. I only upped the dose because we had done 4-FA the night before, and wanted to overcome that tolerance. The good thing is the overwhelming part was over before the Black Keys began so I was able to rock out to them 8D

Well I finally got around to trying out this 6-APB tonight. It is now nearly 3am and started at midnight, I took 100mg. Very impressed feeling nice body rushes now as I type this. Perhaps not the loved up feeling of MDMA but defs good. Hard to explain like MDMA in some ways with the rushes and stuff.


I knew the stuff I got was good when I took a 3mg allergy test to begin with, within 15 mins could feel the effects. I am home alone and really enjoying it, just being by myself and listening to the tunes I want to listen too lol. 


So far at 12.00 (midnight) I took 100mg, within 20 mins could feel strong come-up, went outside to smoke a fag and threw most it away was that minced.


I would say for peeps with not much drug exp 100mg would be 2 intense, 50mg be more suitable and still get decent effects.


The 3 hours from midnight to now 3am was very strong come-up intense in a good way. As the high started to mellow now, I went and bombed another 100mg lol.


Will update later.

It is now 23 hours since first dropped. I have been topping up all night. So far I have went through 750mg, I still have 250mg left. So far I would say that 6-APB does lack the very special effects from MDMA. However, I have enjoyed the experience, after all it is 23 hours since I first dropped and have not slept in ages. For me this will be my last chance of a blow out for sometime so just going for it. 750mg in one night seems a lot I know. Just wondering now should I think about going into the other 250mg.


Be interestd to know has anyone on here have similar binges. Topping up seemed to work for me and kept me going all night.

750?!? Hmmm


Just tried this for the 1st time today. 40mg down. Me and mate just testing it before we have a full night on it next week. 


Few games of FIFA and nothing much was happening. Few tingles. But of warm euphoria. 


Then off to pub. Started to work well in there. Only had 1 of my fave test drink, Stella cidre. No need for even that. Just floating along nicely. Everything was super hd, sunshine, tunes on the jukebox. Now home 3 hours after taking it and just chilling along superbly. Great stuff ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) prefer it to the 5apb already.

Yeah I took 750mg and too be honest I feel fine, I started my session 12 (midnight) on Friday night and went right through to 10am on Sunday. So that was a 34 hour session. I started off with a 100mg dose and then kept topping up another 100mg to 125mg thereafter. I went to bed then at 10am this morning and got up at 3pm. Too be honest i am as bright as a daisy, not really even all that tired. 


I still have another 250mg left, I was nearly going to take that as well but decided going to bed was wiser option and just keep it for again.


I defs enjoyed the whole experience, however, now looking back it defs lacks the extra special effects of MDMA. Although when I first started coming up was quite intense, which I liked. Really tripy like come-up. I would not do it every week, maybe couple times a year and when have the house to myself.

It's worn off now totally. Apart from a terrible stiff neck which I always get when messing with these substances, I'm fine. 5htp hour ago probably helped. Even been able to eat a massive pizza. Top marks for 6apb at that low dose.

I'm looking to take some 6-APB in a couple weeks at a concert(haven't tried it b4). It's a 2 day event and i'm thinking about dosing both days 1st day - 50 + 50mg(redose) and the second day maybe 50 + 100mg. I dont want to be straight rolling, i just wanna be euphoric and get lost in the music. One of the main perks of the drug i was also looking to recieve was the possible OEV's O_O'. I've read varying reports, the white pellets are better quality and may give me a little bit of a psychedelic trip? And the tannish brown ones are just crappy rolls? Will dosing 2 days in a row be absolutely horrible for my brain? I'm still recovering from frying my brain back in high school. Just hoping my brain can handle it and that i get every bang for my buck.


Oh and i forgot, has anyone tried weed to see if it intensifies their experience? i know weed generally helps enhance drugs from all other avenues (accept for acid - dno why) but i'm just checking in to see what others thought about the synergy

i guess it makes more sense to post this here than to start an individual topic? i've had 4 different samples of supposed 6-apb powder from 4 well respected vendors. the first 3 all tested to a somewhat dark green immediately with no color change using mecke and seemed to give effects in line with what it should be although we are going off a bunch of reports of who knows what given all the crap that has surrounded this chemical since it became available.  i'm confident that all 3 are different synths.  the most recent batch tested a dark burgundy turning immediately to black.  i've seen so many different reactions for supposed "real" 6-apb i don't know what to think. i'm not aware of any other compounds that test dark green with mecke. and sorry i don't have any other reagents. thanks for any help or input.

I find weed nice on the comedown but it seems pretty unnecessary/ineffective at any other point.

Yeah that doesn't surprise me.  The second time i ever did it i rolled super hard and had a 3 or 4 day hangover and my girlfriend had a horrific hangover for about a week.  Then next batch we did was pretty weak honestly and i did twice as much and had zero hangover, so who knows what is even in half of these batches that are sold to us.

Tried 90mg spread out over 3 doses on Saturday. 1st down with a kratom tea before I started on the booze. Pleasant. Basically just a mood lift/excitement with super senses. Next one down couple hours later. That was excellent. Was slightly drunk too by now too. In the mix in the local bars. Lights now standing out. Music seemed amplified. Confidence sky high. Had a period of about 90mins of euphoria. Seemed to get stronger the closer you got to women and the dance floor :D 

Tried 3rd up my nose. Not recommended. Was so light and fluffy it was like snorting house dust. that was about 3am. Moved onto a club. Living the lights and music, and people watching. Left at 6am, ate some chips, a 5htp, slept when I got in. Dreamt I was still out. Bit dizzy yesterday but no other issues really. 


Only downsides I've found so far are having to rush to the toilet now and again, and a terrible stiff neck. But get that whatever I take.

So whats the verdict on this.. can it be IV'd? I mean does this dissolve in water? Do people sniff this?

Don't know about IV'ing but I do know that to be able to snort this stuff you'd need nostrils of steel.

I always find the first dose has to be in the sweet spot. 150mg for me. Redosing doesn't bring back any of the good effects - only the negative. And if I take a larger dose than 150mg then it's massively less enjoyable. Larger doses seem to drop the good effects and increase the negative to a much greater extent than MDMA.

That 30mg or so I snorted didn't feel particularly harsh, compared to summat like ethylphenidate. But it's the consistency of it that gets you. So fine and light it flies everywhere inside the nostrils/mouth/throat.

Huh, to me it was the worst thing I ever put up my nose 8(

However I agree on the consistency bit, that made it that much worse with the instant coughing fit that ensued.

I'm going to stick to doing this one orally, a very nice substance ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

All the batches of 6/5APB I received had such a fine texture that snorting was not an option, well of course out of curiosity I did try it twice lol but it just made me cough for 5minutes, after attempting to snort like 5mg. 


Both 6 and 5APB are just 100% designed to be taken orally, that way they work just beautiful, no sense in trying any other ROA the hard way. 


Interestingly for me the ideal dose was also 100-150mg, despite being a heavy guy I only had to take the same doses as girls who weigh less than half of me.

I don't fucks with any ROA method for this besides putting it in a capsule. It's so fluffy though, I can just perfectly fit 150mg and no more, although my preferred dose is around 100mg.

Friday night I took a (home made) cap of 100mgs of 6-apb and 50mgs of 5-apb(for a total of 150mg) around 4:30pm. I felt it coming on by 5:30. Mood lift,music sounded better,urge to play my bass and mess around with effect pedals and I ended up chatting with my Mom over the phone for a bit. 


With this last batch I had I noticed that besides being super fluffy it also seems less potent. I was coming down by 7:30 so I took another cap filled with 110mgs of 6-apb around 8:30ish. I stayed up til 3:30 am taking with my 14 year old step daughter about deja vu and astral projection. Something I normally wouldn`t do(but I had a nice talk with her anyway).


The pellets that first came out were much stronger than the batch I have now. I had some jaw grind,no appetite,almost no eye wiggles(I normally do on 6-apb) and no problem going to bed. In general the effects I had were all much weaker and shorter acting than what I experienced at similar dosages(100mg to 150mg).

    I also woke up with a bad headache that lasted until 5pm. I was also pretty groggy and slow witted most of the day. Side effects I`ve only gotten with this batch.


I think it`s time to try out a new batch,I might order again soon.

has anyone commented on this?:


6-apb:  LD-50 (Oral) - 5628mg/kg (rat)

MDMA:  LD-50 (Oral) - 350 mg/kg  (rat)

MDA:  LD-50 (ip)- 92 mg/kg (mouse)  (not sure what "ip" is...)


seems to be substantially less (physically) toxic than the classic MDx's.  perhaps neurotoxicity is a different beast. 


not sure what to think of this....

After reading all your articles on here I think I must be immune to 6apb, 2 nights ago I tried it out for the first time, I stated of slowly 30 mg half hour later andother 50 I just wasnt getting the kick so I snorted another 30 mgs and it hit me. I did enjoy it I have great visial and was happy for a long time howere I had to keep redosing to keep the buzz going. I ended up going through the whol gram in a 24 hour period, I never experienced any jaw clenching or any really bad side affects, the worst I felt was nasea and a major headach which usually happens when messing with serotonin.But I can't say I got anything major for this rc It definitely wasn't work 56.00 for a gram all in one night. Also the empathy was very lacking It kept me more in my own world, Now I don't know if I got a bad batch or what but the stuff I tried was wack and it was from a very reliable source.If anybody has any clues as to what I could have gotten pleas chime in. I want to know if I should use this vendor again or look elsewhere

That's methanol, and not the APB! there's no info about 6-apb's LD50 yet.

the [safety data sheet](http://www.logical-standards.com/uploads/pdfs/english/MSDS-AMP1275.23-01-GB.pdf) you're referring to is (partly) about 6-apb in MeOH solution.


i suppose those new legal high laws in newzealand will get a lot of such useful information to us, but i guess it will still take a while...

I did enjoy it I have great visial and was happy for a long time howere I had to keep redosing to keep the buzz going. I ended up going through the whol gram in a 24 hour period, I never experienced any jaw clenching or any really bad side affects, the worst I felt was nasea and a major headach which usually happens when messing with serotonin.But I can't say I got anything major for this rc It definitely wasn't work 56.00 for a gram all in one night. Also the empathy was very lacking It kept me more in my own world, Now I don't know if I got a bad batch or what but the stuff I tried was wack and it was from a very reliable source.If anybody has any clues as to what I could have gotten pleas chime in. I want to know if I should use this vendor again or look elsewhere

so what you complaining about ?

what you should've done is

1. allergy test

2. eaten 100mg

3. had fun for 9 hours then come down


its not a drug many people snort, and a look though the thread and you will see mixed opinions about redosing. So your 24 bender was a waste IMO, it's just not that kind of drug.

you might want to edit out the price too

No I think I'll keep the price in there, Because that is alot of money to spend for a night. To me this doesn't even come close to good ol mary, I'd put this in the category of a good ol dime bag of weed. I was expecting so much more after reading peoples threads, And where was the empathy? I didn't feel empathetic at all, Also the only reason I redosed so much is because the good buzz went away so quick. It just wasn't close to what it's hyped up to be, If it's that good for everyone else stick with it, it just isn't my cup of tea. Makes me wonder if people just overate it on here


By the way I did the allergy test I just forgot to mention that, I took about 2 mg and waited a good 45 minutes before trying anymore.

Actually now that my head has cleared up a bit I have to say you are definitely right. I think I did do way too much, doesn't it seem like I should have felt some major side effects doing all that though. I didn't really feel any side effects also sleep was no problem after that I got tired laid down and fell right to sleep. The only thing I was really looking for was the empathy I get from mdai and I thought this would give me all that and more. I definitely felt chatty but it was like I was in my own mind I wanted to talk about what I wanted to talk about and that doesn't do much good. I think it would probably have been better to take it before going out somewhere, when I'm sitting here with a computer in my room it gets quite boring. I definitely enjoyed it but it just seemed to put me in my own world which I didn't like. I like to conversate with people, listen to them and just have some great conversations. That is why I tried this rc and when it didn't give me that I tried more thinking I must have gotten some weak shiz. I will try it again in about 1 1/2 months but I think I'll take about 100 mg and go somewhere fun that way I can see if its more fun when I get to conversate with some people. I know ICQ totally sucked when I was feeling it, Everybody chatting at once I just couldn't get into it. I would like some opinions on how long it actually takes people to feel it, I took it on an empty stomach and didn't feel much of anything until I snorted it. I know snorting is harsh my throat burned forever but it sure hit when I did it. I think I'll take about 100 mg about an hour before I go out next time and maybe it will kick in by then. It seems to me if I take small doses 45 mins to an hour apart it just doesnt hit. Its like starting all over again.

Only sometimes. Euphoria is always there, more so than with mdma, ime. But half the time, instead of empathy, I'm filled with my own hedonistic joy. It has given me empathy in a group setting. But, I think it might be better suited for a long night alone. One where I can do as I please, when I please.

Well I finally got a pure batch of the 6-apb. I have yet to try it though. Will let you know how it is compared to the other batch I had which I did not enjoy much at all. 


To me, 6-apb seems like a bad choice now that 5-IT is in town. This is because 6-apb seems like it can't be taken except once a month? That is pretty extreme with the wait period. Even MDA I could take several times a week and get off great every time. So 6-apb must be a lot more draining or something....this is what turns me off, but I'll wait till my brain is fresh (if that ever happens) and try it out. I know 5-IT works everytime I take it, and you never seem to get a tolerance to that stuff much....too bad 6-apb is not like that or I would give it a try sooner, but I don't want to waste the experience by risking it on low brain chemicals.

I had told a friend about 6-apb and she decided to buy some (a rather large quantity at that) and decided that after trying it she did not want it anymore and decided to just give me the rest to get it off of her hands. A buddy and I decided we were going to use it at a festival. We had taken one (aprox.115) at about 3:30 pm and didn't feel much until about 5:00 and only felt like we were slightly rolling on MDMA. By 7:30 we had taken three each and felt a very strong rolling sensation very similar to the effects of MDMA. I had smoked 2 joints after swallowing the third pill and felt pure bliss. I felt kind of lazy and was enjoying just sitting down and taking everything in. When i'm on MDMA I'm ready to go and find it very hard to sit down. By 8:30 the one dj we were all there for was finally on and me and my buddy are in a heavy roll, the music has taken over and i almost felt like i had no control as my body was just in constant movement. Everything from 9pm-12am is one huge blur, i vaguely remember kissing a girl i was with and getting a light show from someone but everything else is lost and i have absolutely no recollection of the last two hours of the festival or getting home. No chance in hell i was sleeping on this and i was rolling til about 5 in the morning before i saw any signs of a comedown. diarrhea for about two days after taking but not so much for my buddy. days after i still had a feeling like everything wasn't right, i felt like my days were just blurred together but maybe it's a summer thing. Every time i had tried to sleep for the next 7 days i was getting some of the most terrifying nightmares i had ever had and found myself almost scared to go to sleep. I also felt a lot of emptiness emotionally, i was depressed and felt alone for a good week after taking these which is never me usually. i am a very happy person generally so to find myself feelings these emotions was daunting. all in all the feeling of the 6-apb was like very strong MDMA in the dosage i had taken. I do not think the feelings after the fact were worth the 5+ hours i got to enjoy at a festival. The week after was a very lonely week for me...

Redbong I'm with you on this, That is exactly what it did to me, I enjoyed the hell out of it but I would really rather have something I can enjoy with a group of people. I would like to find something similar to mdma, Something that will make me enjoy being around people. I wonder what would be a better mix mdai/6apb or 5apb/6apb


I'm still in a way wondering if I didn't just get a shitty batch also, Because I had no jaw clenching and no real side effects, After reading all the reports I figured I'd be in for a shitty comedown, but the worst I had was a major headache and throat hurt like hell, probably from snorting about 100 mg altogether. Maybe I did just get a bad batch.

6-apb is not meant to be snorted. I'm pretty sure its too thick and doesn't break down in the mucus membranes the right way so you wont get the full effect, should of tried popping it for the first time.

I did pop it first almost 100 mg I didn't snort it until an hour and a half passed by and I still wasn't feeling it. Thats why I took it up the nostril after that I did feel it though. Along with alot of pain. I think it might be much better if I take it with some 5apb or some mdai It seems to lack what they bring


I started out on Friday night and ended up doing 1 gram by saturday night and got nothing like what I've read about. Seems like I should have been feeling some major effects. I enjoy sitting around relaxing and chatting with people but I got none of this from the 6, I don't know maybe its just not for me. Maybe I react differently than most people. To tell you the truth I seriously got more out of mdai alone than this. It just lacked the whole social aspect of things.

That"s cause apb can easily take up to a full 3 hours to hit ya, so probably some of the nasty snorted dose added a littlemtomyour overall effect but it was surely mainly from the oral dose![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


Take your planned dose orally and wait for it to come on fully next time, best way bar none imo.


Though if you never got a good effect, then the batch was either bad, you had a tolerance from other substances or simply, apb works really bad for you ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

You got a link that shows 5-IAI was ever synthed? I'm pretty sure any GC/MS results I have seen for substances sold as 5-IAI showed that there was in fact no 5-IAI. I'm pretty sure I read this in the 5-IAI Big and Dandy threads somewhere. Maybe I didn't, but the point still stands that unless it's sent for analysis, you certainly can't say for sure that what anyone received was 5-IAI. 


Anyway, first post! I have tortured though all of the 6-APB threads, and I would just like to complain at the total lack of control from the moderators. I read them all to get as much info as I could about this substance, only to read endless pages of rambling. More recently, the painfully repetitive and off-topic posts from King of Beans. Please, for everyone's sake (and harm reduction's sake), enforce the rules that you run by!


I have tried 6-APB 6 times now, with doses ranging between 100mg and 150mg. This is a very promising substance. My experiences coincide with the other good experiences on here, so I see no use in making any trip reports. I would like to say, however, that I do get very hot while under the influence of 6-APB. I suffer from hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating) so I sweat very easily. In fact, I over sweat, and I often get the chills due to this. I also get diarrhoea during the come-up. These are the only side effects that put me off. I also get a dry mouth, large pupils, wobbly eyes and legs, jaw clenching, increased heart rate, but these don't bother me so much.


Could anyone suggest a remedy for the diarrhoea on the come-up? I am yet to try this substance out in a club, only because of this reason.


I would just like to stress that I personally can overheat very quickly while on 6-APB, and it is possible that you could too. Drinking water and having breaks like you would on MDMA is strongly advised. In fact, treat this substance exactly like it were MDMA. Remember the 1 Month Rule, but ideally 3 months at least is recommended. I have had no bad come-downs or Tuesday Blues with 6-APB, maybe I'm lucky, who knows.


Also, this can take a long time to kick in. Please, for your first time, give at least 3 hours for effects to kick in before you even consider redosing. Also, the high comes in waves. One minute you're fucked out of your brains on tunes, the other you feel completely sober. Don't redose while on the sober part of a wave thinking that you're coming down. Be aware that the high could come straight back when considering redosing.


On the topic of redosing, I haven't had much success with it. The desired-effects/side-effects ratio decreases massively after redosing. It seems that to get the best effects, the first dose has to be just right. You need to find your dose, so start low and work your way up. I started with 125mg and was almost overwhelmed by the experience. Slightly higher and things may have gotten out of control. 100mg is a good starting dose, but if you're new to recreational drugs, or are nervous about your first experience with 6-apb, 75mg would be a good dose to give mild effects, and will certainly not be too much.


Make sure you know how to look after yourself while under the influence of this drug. I would follow the same recommendations as with MDMA. And don't think of this drug as an MD(M)A replacement; it is a wonderful drug in its own right! Perhaps when this gets banned, we will be looking for a 6-APB replacement! And most importantly... have fun! (And before you say that being safe is more important than having fun, remember you chose to consume a research chemical in the first place... By all means be safe, but have fun at the same time)

The combo of 5 and 6 apb is definitely better for empathy, though I still wouldn't say its on par with mdma. Nothing has been ime. I've never had mdai though.

MDAI is a highly Selective Serotonin Releasing Agent (SSRA). 6-APB is speculated to be a releasing agent and reuptake inhibitor of serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine. If I were to try this combo I would definitely be careful with dosages, as to avoid serotonin sydrome. I suspect the same goes for 5-APB. A combo of 5-APB and 6-APB has been tried by many. I would suggest reading these to give you some ideas:


[http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/548570-The-Big-amp-Dandy-5-APB-Thread](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/548570-The-Big-amp-Dandy-5-APB-Thread)

[http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/600567-6-APB-Subthread-Combinations](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/600567-6-APB-Subthread-Combinations)


I have only tried 6-APB so far, but with all the contradicting comparisons I've read between the two, I think they are very similar in effects. 5-APB does seem to be ~30% stronger dose for dose, so if anything, it is more cost effective. 6-APB has been used MUCH more though, which gives me a somewhat more peace of mind than if I were experimenting with 5-APB.


IMO 6-APB isn't a drug to combine with. It acts as a releasing agent AND reuptake inhibitor of the 3 aforementioned neurons, so there is nothing missing chemically. I agree that I do find myself lost in my own world of bliss on this substance, and I can imagine not being very social among a group of friends. To me, this is a drug for those rainy nights home alone. I'm still willing to give it a go in a club before I finalize this idea though.


Maybe some drug combos will work, maybe they won't, but I personally believe this drug is it's own drug and not accompanied very well. Plus you're putting yourself at more risk when combining drugs.

If the larger vendors are lying then the info needs to get out. Someone being 'pretty sure' they may have read something somewhere is hearsay, not evidence. I was asking a question, not making a statement.

Im going to a 12H non stop rave this weekend, so out of all options thought 6-APB would be the best option for such long party, but I was thinking.... If things get boring would top up with low dose mdma be recommendable? Any potential downsides? 


Also, just one more question, anyone tried mixing with K? 


Thanks in advance. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

I've found 6-APB to work fine for 12H "music festival then club" enjoyment, with a redose about 4-5 hours in as part of the plan. You will have definite waves during it, with inevitable trough periods. I find it great though, and am looking forward to doing it next friday at a music festival myself.


Also excellent is AMT with occasional doses of MXE - AMT trip lasts even longer than 6-APB and is also good for euphoria / music appreciation if not quite to 6-APB levels. More trippiness / visuals though with amt. The MXE boosts that side of things nicely towards the end of the trip....

It's very well known for vendors to lie. And I'm positive I read it in the 5-IAI Big and Dandy thread somewhere, but I cannot be bothered to search through it, sorry. Search through it for yourself if my statement bothers you.


Anyway, please does anyone have any suggestions to prevent the diarrhoea on the come-up? I'm hoping to take it in a club in a month's time, and I really don't want to worry about this inconvenience lol.

Works fine for the come up too. I just predose with a couple an hour or so before dropping it, no problem. 


Went out clubbing for the first time a coupla weeks back on it, have always just had nights in with it before. Low dose for me, around 120mg cos I was in straight company and didn't want to be twatted. Found the enhanced music appreciation and desire to dance was there, really chilled out and sociable, good vibe to everything, but it was lacking the energetic bounce and euphoric push I always used to get with Ecstasy ( E circa 1990-91 though it has to be said! ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

And King of Beans, please don't give readers the impression that this is safe to do as often as you claim. For all we know it may well be, but because the fact that we just don't know, we should be on the safe side and be cautious.


If you haven't had great experiences from this yet, then it's probably not the drug you are looking for. This is certainly not an MD(M)A replacement, but I personally can see some resemblance. As for 5-IT, I've heard enough bad experiences from it to put me off, but I can certainly see why some would prefer it over 6-APB.

I found 6-apb to surprisingly be more euphoric than MDMA; however, it lacked the empathy that MDMA gives imho.  Personally, I wouldn't hesitate taking this to a 12 hour dance party as I was able to dance for 7 hours straight with 2 hours of sleep the night before and no food all day.  I found it very stimulating to say the least. YMMV of course as KoB keeps on stating.

king of beans, i love mdma/mda but the problem is it is very hard to get around my area, even if i did get hold of some, i would doubt the fact that it even is mdma or even if it is, it would most likely be heavily cut. so to me this is the next best thing, fuck paying extortion prices for some shit cut supposed mdma..


i really enjoy 6apb/5apb as yeah there not exactly like mdma/mda but there are very similar in effects, and anyway i love the crazy trippiness and visuals 6apb gives, and to me the euphoria is just as good if not better because it lasts a hell of alot longer.


i really advise you to try a high dose in the 150 - 250mg range, its very different, never overwhleming, just pure amazingness

King of Beans, your last few posts have really taught me a lot about harm reduction and the substance 6-APB itself... (sarcasm).


What is everyone's preferred dosage these days? I can remember way back before 6-APB was released in 2010 when a few people had the original samples, and were blown away from doses of 70-100mg. Nowadays I'm reading of people taking up to 250mg as an initial dose. I remember having 170mg once and was extremely overwhelmed, so my doses these days are 125-150mg. Do you think this could be due to individuals' chemistry? Or dodgy vendors/weaker batches? Maybe both? I can say for sure that the batch I have right now is seriously strong, and the thought of eating 250mg of this terrifies me.

Holy shit, tl;dr.


Took 80mg the other night, really enjoyable - very similar to my experiences with mdma, even the loved up feeling. Although, no matter what drug I'm on I either feel loved up or am completely emotionless...

I think the wide range of purity is responsible for the ever increasing dosages. In 2010 when I first took 6-apb,all I needed was one branded pellet and I was extremely high for 7 or more hours. I think those pellets were stated being 100mg?


Now this last batch I had(powder,not pellets) from the same company felt MUCH weaker. I had to start off with a dose of 150-170mgs and often had to re-dose a few hours later when the effects wore off. A 3 hour high from 170mgs is a huge difference from 100mgs and an 7 hour effect.


I hope the next order I get is more potent.

There are many types of euphoria - some people get euphoria from mxe, some from lsd, some from heroin so I think it is quite necessary to explain how the euphoria from the subtance feels. I appreciate all the information given on APBs - it helps me to decide whether/how to use it. Of course as long as the informatino is about the chemicals and not "finding God" or other bullshit...

So I've read some recent rumors that a certain high SoS vendor (with 6-apb needs much less than usual (75mg overwhelmed some)) and causes about a very uncomfortable first 45 min. I can say that is exactly how my 6-apb is currently from that vendor aswell. People stating possible impuritys such as PMA. That vendor is under mgmt changes and closed, another vendor had a similar thing happen at the same time and they dumped there current 6-apb and got a new batch. Can anyone shed some more light on the info? I have a test kit coming in the mail as we speak.

It shouldn't. The speculation was based off the fact the mecke turned green, there are mixed reports on weather or not PMA reacts to Mecke so the actual impuritie is unknown.

I too have experience with varying strength of batches. Unsurprisingly, the stronger batch was from one of my most trusted vendors, and the weaker one was my first experience with another vendor. This RC industry is worryingly dangerous :/


And yeah I suppose it would be helpful to compare to MDMA, I take what I said back. But I really think 6-APB has its own unique characteristics, as can be seen from reading King of Bean's posts. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


And please for the love of God (whichever definition you choose) someone clean up this thread.


Oh, I just remembered the original reason for coming here! What are the differences in effects between, say, 100, 125, 150, 175, 200... mg? I find 100mg too mild, 125mg very nice and pleasant, 150mg to be a little more crazy. I'm tempted to give upping the dose another try, is it worth it? Slightly too much MDMA and I forget most of the night, that seems like a waste to me.

I've gone over 150 once, took roughly 180,  but it was with poor quality 6-apb so Im not sure if the results are accurate. Upping the dose will increase the ending stimulation and make it a bit more trippy. People say at 200 is where the visuals really start to come out. If you do up the dose I wouldn't up it more than 25mg as anymore could very easily overwhelm you, from personal experience when I went from 100 to 125 to 150 (my preferred dosage) and the 25mg increase wasn't too much for me to handle. YMMV

the most ive took is 500mgs in 1 night, i took 2 200mg bombs within 2 hours of each other and a 100mg a few of hours later, it was fair to say i was high as fuck, i was mashed, i couldnt walk straight, my gurn was out of control, shaking, tripping balls, visuals were warping all over the place. i was having the time of my life! haha but by the end things got abit fucked up and got stuck in abit of a psychosis when the high started to wear off but that was eased with some benzos.


the reason for taking so much was that my scales are fucked and i thought i was doing 125mg bombs...


i dont think id ever do that much again, but it was an experience i give it that, and 1 of the best nights of my life, but yeah overwhlemed isnt the word

every time I take much more than 100 mgs, I end up puking my guts out, trippin' out over the toilet, and it takes a lot of willpower for me to stop vomiting, not fun.  It really shatters the positive qualities of the experience if I take too much.  I want a trip, not a trial, some people want to take it further, I don't care to go that deep inside my own head, when my whole visual field is swimming uncontrollably, the sensory overload stresses my shit out.  I just get so zoned out/tranced out/maybe even describe it as "holed" out on it sometimes, 20 minutes feels like 4 hours have gone by.  A good plan, a good setting, and an appropriate dosage are crucial.  I've always found lower doses to be more enjoyable (and easier to remember!)


Having taken it several times, I always enjoy the unique body high/euphoric feelings I get from it, but I want to explore the hallucinogenic aspect more.  So many differences between 6-apb and MDMA, that became apparent the other night, I took some MDMA, and everybody else was on 6-APB.  6-APB lacks the social/empathy push that MDMA gives me.

6-APB tested instantly black more purple though with mandelin reagent. 5-APB turned black instantly. No purple. Any ideas why this is the case?

That doesn't seem too surprising. Blacker tends to be a good sign, and there could be many reasons why it turned black so fast.

I'm pretty fucking stupid. I actually binged on this chemical for twenty to thirty days (I'm not even sure) during my summer holiday. 100-200mg oral each day - 2.5 grams down the hatch. I never re-dosed the same day. Obviously I felt like shit when I stopped, but after a couple of days I felt completely fine. I, of course, cannot rule out the possibility of brain/kidney/liver damage, neurotoxicity and all the other good stuff, but it's now a few months later and honestly - I feel great.

Non of that puts a significant dent into 6_APB, though Theanine will limit anxiety a little.  You'd need something like haldol and a serotonin agonist to block this drug.

Are people still buying those pellets? Convenience is the only advantage of them over powder, but surely the ridiculous pricing and the inability to dose for yourself (accurately) would've put people off by now. The name Benzo Fury is just screaming out for media attention too. If more people bought the powder then 6-APB wouldn't be so under the attention of the government. I mean, just the word "fury" in its name is just begging for it to get banned.

I know that, but my point is that the branding "Benzo Fury" is going to get this more attention than if they were just simply named 6-APB. And the fact that they're pellets makes it harder to adjust doses.


I'm going to be using this at a club in just over 2 weeks, it'll be my 7th experience with this substance. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) I'll be dosing at 125mg to ensure a fun but not overwhelming night. Would it be ok to drink alcohol before I go to the club? I'm only thinking of maybe 5-10 units. Would this dampen the high very much?

Can't speak from personal experience, but my girl drank 3ish shots about 2 hours into the experience, she was extremely hot. From what I understand, It isn't a good thing to do but at least when it comes to MDxx type drugs, many people do drink while on it. I'd personally not recommend anything over a beer or two, just for taste really, can't see alcohol adding to the experience.

I'd recommend going easy on it though, as just as when combining alcohol with other stimulants, it can make you feel like you can easily consume more alcohol AND the drug involved, which can lead to some reckless amounts of drinking/high doses and can be dangerous.

how do you feel the stimulation, crash/comedown, bruxism and other negative side effects like blue tuesdays compared to MDMA or other empathogens? Do you think/feel that this may be more neurotoxic or harmful in general terms than MDMA?

I definitely feel a few hours residual stimulation after the high, but I wouldn't say I experienced any crashes, just a smooth comedown. I certainly get a trembling jaw and grinding teeth, and can be annoying on the comedown. I don't feel depressed at all after 6-APB, but I may just be lucky here. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png) For me, all of these symptoms are much less pronounced than with MDMA. I can't really comment on the neurotoxicity based on how I feel, but I can comment that there feels to be less serotonin and dopamine depletion than with MDMA, based on no depression or urge to redose.


I'd go as far to say that the side-effects are similar to MDMA but much easier to deal with. This is with doses ranging 100-150mg.

Am I the only one who is unable to enjoy this chemical? The comeup is always ridden with anxiety and discomfort and despite several tries at even low doses I always end up deciding to kill it with a serotonin antagonist.


I know it has great potential and I've experienced the waves of euphoria and all the good it has, but there always comes a point where the effects and headspace change begin creeping up way too fast and become too overwhelming. I've had a very negative experience with psychedelics that I never want to revisit and despite knowing that 6-APB's psychedelic limitations are a bit of eye wobbling, color enhancement, and minor headspace changes I can't trust it to let it work, I'm always afraid it's only a second away from showing me a terrifying and heavy psychedelic edge that I don't want.

Sapphires, this sounds like it is is entirely your own anxiety manifesting itself, rather than an effect of the drug itself. 6-APB for me does not qualify as a true psychedelic.  It makes no profound changes to consciousness whatsoever, the headspace is recognisably that of my normal, everyday self. I'm more chilled out, serene, relaxed, open, but that's as far as the changes go. There is nothing to fear there. It's not about to grab your brain and turn it outside out, or show you what the darkest recesses of your imagination look like. It's not LSD. It's a stimulant with a bit of a trippy edge, but it's not a trip. I've gone as high as ~300mg as a starting dose with this stuff ( average at around 200-250mg personally ) and still got nowhere near anything like that. 


How high have you dosed, and at what point have you always bailed out? The come-up once properly underway can feel quite intense, yes, and I can see how you could feel like it's rising too high too fast and going somewhere that's too much because of that but at 2rs+ it levels right out and becomes very comfortable.

I really enjoy 6-APB once I'mw done with the come-up. I too feel overwhelmed at the beginning, and I'm not sure what to do about it. My lowest dose has been 100mg, so I think the next time I'll try 90mg.

Quote from Wikipedia:


> 6-APB is unscheduled in the United States, but not currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration for human consumption. While 6-APB has some chemical similarity to The Schedule I drug MDA, (also known as tenamfetamine), which might make it illegal under the Federal Analog Act, it differs substantially from MDA in that the methylenedioxy ring system has been replaced with a benzofuran ring in which an oxygen atom has been replaced by a carbon atom at the 6- position.

I interpret this to be legal in the US. I also haven't heard of anyone from the US having legal issues ordering some as of yet.

Good evening dear Bluelighters,


Is it normal for 6-APB to take two hours to kick in (105mg, 2h after my last meal) ?


I don't know if it's related but the effects eventually manifested after I've eaten a copious plate of pasta. 

Does 6-APB come up quicker if the stomach is not empty ? That's not the case with MDMA IME.

The come up is much quicker on an empty stomach, as quick as 30 mins. On a relatively full stomach, it can take 2 hours or even more.

People have said they don't see this as a full blown psychedelic, however for me, that's just what it is. In fact this weekend is the only time I have consumed 6apb and the experience was similar to rolling on ecstasy. Every other time I have had it, even on doses of 100Mg I have gotten amazing visuals, an altered state of consciousness and audible hallucinations. I can see why people feel jittery on it as I have myself, also when I try to talk on it, it makes me feel nervous and I stutter, I've also noticed this to be the case with friends.

6-APB in the best club in Manchester in 7 days... I can't wait! Just thinking about this substance makes me excited. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) I'm still undecided on the dosage though. I'm now thinking of 150mg, but I'd love to go higher if I knew there wouldn't be a considerable increase in side effects. Note: I've only gone up to 150mg so far.

In my experience unfortunately pushing for higher and higher doses increases the side-effects exponentially while only increasing the desirable effects by a much smaller amount. I think 175mg would be fine as I suggested to you in PM, but I wouldn't think 200mg+ would give a better ratio of good to bad effects, and I'd think 150mg would be preferable.

I think I'll just stick with 150mg, as all the other times I tried 6-APB my serotonin levels weren't high.

Sooooooo I've managed to score some decent MDMA, and my friend will be taking it for her first time at the club. It's been 7 months since I last tried it, so I'm having trouble comparing it to 6-APB. Which would give me a better time at the club?

MDMA, if its good quality that is, all personal preference tho, i prefer 6apb at home, too much of a mind fuck in a club sometimes, depends on the type of people that will be at the club too

Yeah, MDMA. It has to be said I haven't had MDMA in years so perhaps it's not a fair comparison, I need to see how what's available affects me these days, but even so I don't think 6-APB has quite the same bouncing-about-full-of-beans stimulant push you'd get from good E. 6-APB's a little heavier and lazier IME, and not quite as everyone's-your-best-mate-ever euphoric and empathic. Perfectly relaxed, chilled out, good vibe sociable with a good bit of energy, just not enough to dance yer bollox off for 6 hours straight. Even with MPA added to the mix for some extra clean stimulation 6-APB wasn't quite there. Depends what you want from the stuff I guess.

I can confirm that, during holidays I once tried 190mg at once and the comeup was pure hell, comedown was harsher as well, the peak turned out very euphoric as usual but not really significantly better than say 140mg so no need to take bigger doses, unless you know what you're doing and/or have tolerance to this kind of drugs. 


Damn I myself now need to wait at least full month before its worth ingesting APBs again because I took other shits during holidays..

It's definitely a case of diminishing returns. I've pushed as hard as ~300mg in a single dose. It was not all that much more powerful than 250mg. 250mg was noticeably more powerful than 200mg  but not massively so. Enough that I prefer 250 to 200, but there's not much in it. It seems to be very forgiving stuff to me. 50mg jumps don't suddenly push you into woah, way too much territory, but once you find your sweet spot you won't want to do less, but not a whole lotta point doing more.

I've decided I'm going to take MDMA ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) actually, would a combo be any good at all? I like how 6-APB lasts much longer (at least for me)

2 hours? Peak of 8-10 hours easy, don't even think about sleeping for 16. In fact I'll usually go through the whole of the next day before crashing into bed cos if I do it in around 6pm it's early afternoon before I feel back to base anyways and may as well stay up from that point. Sometimes not being able to talk about sources is really counter-productive and this seems one of those times cos there must be a real question here about what it is you're getting. You ever put it through a testing kit? I've never heard anyone mention anything like a 2 hour peak with the stuff.

When I used empathogens weekly my peaks from 6-APB were only 2 hours long, 3 if I was lucky. I've stopped using them so frequently now so I'll have to try it again with less tolerance.

Maybe. Maybe I'm including some of the slide down but for me the fall off is so slow and gentle as to only become really noticeable at about the 8 hours plus mark. The fall off of effects from a full peak at say +3-4hrs to effects felt at +8hrs is really neither here nor there. I'd still class it as pretty much peak effect. I do dose [very?] high though, and generally have fairly long tolerance breaks ordinarily. Say on average at least a month, if not two between runs. Would certainly explain a massive difference in peak time compared to someone doing a lesser amount of it week in, week out, but even when I've had weekly runs at it I'm not getting a whole lot less than that. Odd.

LOL, yeah, indeed. Effects with this stuff do seem to be *very* subjective, more than I might ordinarily expect of a substance assuming most batches people are using are of similar purity and similarly synthed, some finding it really psychedelic, some not, some finding it really stimmy, some less so. The range of effects felt by users seems to be very broad. Perhaps unusually so?

I only ever get visual alterations, no psychedelia of any sort. But I seem to get much more euphoria than a lot of other people suggest. Maybe set and setting play a big influence on the experience. I usually blast out tunes and I'm in such another world that I probably wouldn't notice any visuals even if they were there. I'd hate to not listen to music while on this though. I think next time I try this I'll be with a group of friends so I'll see how that changes the experience.

is the general consensus that 6-apb while a potent releaser of 5-ht, releases less than MDMA? Any speculation on the 5/6 combo?

Would there be much of a cross tolerance with this stuff & 5-MEO-DALT?


Is 110mg 5apb & 80mg6apb a good dose or would the 5 overpower the 6?

I think the "standard" ratio is 5 parts 5-apb with 6 parts 6-apb. I think that much 5-apb would certainly overpower the 6-apb.

o my Freak!  6-apb is so other-worldly and blissful.  tried it for the first time tonight at 90 mgs.  wow wow wow a million times over.  starts very similar to MDA but ends up way more psychedelic.  it tested dark purple on a marquis.  there's really nothing else this could have been.

way more blissful than MDA or MDMA for me.  feels more benign so far also.  A+ with eeeeeease....

was soooo mashed out for the first 2 hours, i couldn't even do anything but moan and sigh.  never a dull moment....

i will never miss MDA again.

uh-ah.

36h ago 2 friends and I dosed 170-175mg. I'm experienced with a shitload of different drugs and combinations thereof (including heroic doses of various psychedelics, combos like DMT+N2O and so on...) but this experience was among the finest, deepest, most beautiful (probably single most..), instructive and intense (talking of +++, bordering ++++) experiences I've ever had. 6-apb is seriously good. it is GOLD... ![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif)

right now I feel "quite" worn out but mentally still refreshed and inspired. gonna write a trip report when everything has settled.

My 6apb experiences have ended at an amount of about 170mg being optimum.  I just use it at home for listening to music and getting a bit blissed.  Ive added 5apb once at about 100mg/60mg but could not honestly say if anything was greatly different.  As others have mentioned I find it a lazy, heavyish trip.  Too high a dose adds nothing except high body load and more prolonged hangover, for me anyway.  I also find that chucking it in a drink and downing it has been better.  Due to the rancid metalicy? taste I have nearly been sick doing this.  I gelcapped it a couple of times but that took much longer to come up but was less jittery.  I am not gelcapping again as both those times felt less of an experience for some reason.  Maybe a rizla next time.  Duration was much as many have said, 1.5-2 hours comeup and 2-3 hours very pleasant.  Residual stim after and usually a couple of etizolams gets me to sleep.  Lazy/tired the next day, but thats about it.  Definitely heed advice re frequency of use not being more than once a month approx.  Cheers

heres to posting some unsubstantiated link.  if there are batches out there that contain synthesis impurities that are making people ill... you know what im not a chemist so I dont fucking know, but this shit is supposedly highly toxic.  what is 6-apb made from anyways?

i dont get your logic, why the Menthofuran link ?

have you a reason to think this is found benzofurans other than the two words ryhme ?


But, i have wondered 6apb gives me the shits...something to do with the seratonin receptos in our stomaches i guess...?

I get the shits on just about every drug I try, except cannabinoids/weed. Although with MDAI, it just empties my bowels in what feels like a natural way. With any other drug, I get nasty diarrhoea. So from my experience, serotonin action by itself isn't so stressful on my body. Dopamine just flushes everything out of me. Even caffeine is terrible on my body.


I tried 50mg of 6-APB last night, just before going to a house party. The effects were surprisingly pronounced at this low dose. Include alcohol and AM-2201 and the feeling is just swell. I'd go as far as saying it's been one of my favourite experiences with 6-APB; the feeling of contentment was just that good.

Anyone tried 6-APB with amphetamine? I'm thinking about taking this combo later this year @ a techno party. I'll start off with 160mg 6-APB and when that wears off (usualy about 4 hours later) i'd like to bomb some speed. MDMA+speed is highly neurotoxic and I would avoid that combo. Is it likely that 6-APB+speed causes the same risk? If so, I'll just stick with the APB. Problem with APB is that it just doesn't work so long for me. I have pure APB (lab tested) but it just doesn't last as long as with most people. Redosing works somewhat but not a lot. Tried 5/6-APB combo but didn't like it so mutch.

Yes, it was because the two words rhyme, you guessed correct!!!!  I happened to be looking at various essential oils of plants, and noticed the similarity in name, upon looking at the molecular STRUCTURE I found a similarity between the two.  It struck me as INTERESTING because I don't know of many essential oils containing a furan ring structure.  But fuck it, it is indeed a stretch, and the benzene ring isn't even quite right, and it's not exactly a furane ring.


But if some chinese/ other foreign lab produces a batch with toxic impurities, and some fun-haver on the other side of the world dies because of it, the lab can always claim that it was never intended for human consumption so we're not responsible etc.  MDA and MDMA have been synthe'd so many more times in the world than 6-APB, and the synthesis processes have been more highly refined, at least it has a longer history of being made and we have a general idea of what the synth impurities might be (like safrole or piperonal)  but I have yet to hear what synth impurities there might be in 6-APB.  Read through some of shulgins stuff, there are chemicals out there that simply give very low and impure yeilds when made, such that the final product is some foul and inconsistent sludge of 20% purity or less......which does not really seem to be the case with 6-APB, hardly at all, but it makes me wary nonetheless.  


And on another note, I know somebody who took a bunch of 6-APB and nearly got raped because they were too fucked up to defend themselves or have any fucking foresight at all.  Think that over, Doctor Suess.


Not every overdose or death will be documented or accessible on google, or CNN, or even on bluelight.  Just because overdose and death is not being picked up by the mass media does not mean it is not happening.  And the way the shit reacts so slowly to marquis could have a lot of users thinking they got some weak ass molly and that they have to consume a bunch for it to work.


even if the comedown/etardation is different/less harmful or less painful than MDMA or an impure E pill, you could still die from taking it.  matter of fact, I would rather unnecessarily scare people out of taking it and having a good safe time than see people take it and get hurt or die thinking it was safe (from any cause, be it an auto accident, rape, arrest, serotonin syndrome or otherwise)


probably it is better for people to not take it unless they were responsible and familiar with what it is to begin with.

All quite true, however i do believe [ rightly or wrongly ] vendors will do thier best to avoid negative publicity and / or getting thier products banned.

I imgine the chinese labs will be more hygienic and effecient than criminals. 

But you are right its a risky thing to do....i would say a MDMA pill is safer just by the length of time peole have been taking it, rather than any possible mistakes during the production

I have no idea how much of anything it actually releases but you can bet your roll will be  weaker. 1 week is not enough. Tens of people on this board have confirmed that.

judging by the fact that some people dose a gram of 6-apb in a night and wake up feeling decent, it's REASONABLY safe to assume that single doses are not much to fret over.  


try that with MDA and see what happens.  =)

i don't think anyone's tread in those waters....


besides, intuitively, and with careful attention to your body's reaction, you can judge for yourself what is and isn't right for you.

personally, 6-apb felt as clean or cleaner than molly and gave *significantly* less hangover (and i even dosed 2 nights in a row...which i wouldn't do again or recommend at all).  actually it gave more of a psychedelic hangover than an empathogen hangover, which is to say i felt a little spacey but nothing physically at all.  a headache is a tall-tale sign of organic toxicity, and sufficient doses of MDA or alcohol provide them aplenty.  the complete absence, in my experience, of even a minor hangover from 6-apb suggests at least a tentative, relative safety compared to it's brethren.  


and yes, it has been taken in massive amounts for at least 3 years now....while not entirely informative of safety, that still means SOMETHING!

More by mass ingested. But 6-APB doses are typically lower than those of MDMA.

I have several questions about this substance (6-APB).


1.) A vendor that has in the past provided good product to several friends of mine is now only selling what they call "Batch II" of 6-APB.  It is described as "6APB from this batch is in the form of - off-white tan fine powder". This is substantially different from the dark tan and clumpy powder described in what information I can find on this substance.


The claim is that is the exact same substance, just a different texture.  I have read quite a few accounts of white "6-APB" powder being some random chemical rather than 6-apb.


So my question is: Is is physically possible for 6-APB to be as described?


Disclaimer: I am **not** looking for vendor names, pricing or substance ID. I am just starting my interest in chemistry so would like a more knowledgeable person to say whether this amount of appearance deviation is even possible.


2.) If I have done my research correctly a marquis reagent should turn purple when exposed to 6-APB.  All the other info I can find about testing is very confusing.


MY questions for testing are:


a.) What kits work to help positively ID 6-APB?

b.) What colors do they turn?

c.) If not kits then how can I determine whether a substance is really 6-APB? Do I have to send a sample somewhere or what?


As several people have spoken positively to me about this substance I am looking for some harm reduction advice basically.


My thanks.

Yes, there are batches of 6-APB that are very very fine, and tan colored. It tests purple-black on marquis. - however if you cant test with kits, then yes, obviously theres no way to tell without sending it away.

My understanding is that the tan powder everyone's been used to mostly ( let's call it Batch I ) to date is the succinate form. I've had the much paler light tan / almost cream coloured stuff you're calling Batch II this last month from a vendor claiming it's the HCl version. Results were exactly as per previous batches of the darker succinate, no difference whatsoever. Only got the vendor's word on that but no reason to doubt him. Wonder if anyone else can expand on that at all?

@Sepher and SPDemon,


Thank you for the confirmation that 6-APB can actually come in the described "Batch II" physical form.


Also my thanks for the confirmation on the fact that 6-APB turns Purple-Black when exposed to Marquis reagent. However I am still at a loss for what to expect when I use other testers besides the Marquis. 


Does anyone know the answer to questions a, and b from my original post?


I am going to order test kits and would like to know which to order, I apologize for just asking however my research has turned up contradictory information, and I am turning to blue-light for help with its specialty, harm reduction.


My thanks again to all who bother to answer.

I just used a marquis and it turned dark purple.  no other physical tests were made and the substance was A-OKAY....

it was also a strange, clumpy off white/tannish powder.  didn't see any reason to try multiple tests....

I got a few 6-apb pellets a couple months ago and had very much enjoyed the last 2 experiences and then yesterday I took my last one and felt myself heading into a hypertensive crisis shortly after coming up. My heart was going so fast that it didn't seem to be pumping very effeciently. I got concerned but tried to walk it off and calm down but it was no use. I went back inside and put half a xanax under my tongue and hoped that it would slow my heart down. I was pretty sure I was going to need to go to the hospital. I started driving there and decided to stop at a friend's house instead to see if I could ride it out there and avoid the expense of a hospital visit. I took another half a xanax and talked with my friend and let her know what I had taken. I figured she could get me medical attention if I did get any worse. It took a while but my condition did improve and I was able to ride it out. The xanax killed all euphoria and empathy from it too, of course. 


I'm a bit confused as to why this particular dose had such an extreme effect on me. The last one I took felt really mild and I was even considering a redose. It had been about 3 weeks since my last 6-apb trip. I took it in the afternoon yesterday on an empty stomach. I had not taken any other substances since Friday when I did take about ~2 grams of phenibut. I use phenibut twice a week or so. I occasionally do nitrous. I occasionally use small amounts of cannabis. I'm not on any prescription meds. I drink a reasonable amount of coffee or green tea in the mornings. I don't use any other stimulants. 


These pellets look exactly like the latest "official" batch, although they did not come in the fancy orange foil packets. They definitely felt like some sort of amphetamine. I felt fantastic on the last 2 rolls. Any idea as to why this would happen on my 3rd dose? They are supposed to contain 125mg 6-apb. I'm feeling much more wary of RC's at this point. That was really an unpleasant experience and I would caution others to be very careful. That last pellet felt 10x more potent than the others. 


I think I'll stick to cannabis and nitrous from now on. I can see how someone could die from what just happened to me yesterday. Be careful, people.

I can't tell you why that happened but it is possible that the pellet was contaminated or bogus. I suggest that you never purchase 6-APB (or any other such drug) in pre-made pellets/pills/capsules. Rather, buy the pure chemical from a reputable source and a decent milligram scale. Stay safe.

I'm sorry to hear you had negative experience Booda, but I have to say my experiences were basically the opposite:

the only time ever I felt really bad physically (with no euphoria) from 6-APB was after consuming the powder. The pellets always worked beautifully. So go figure ![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif) IMO the chance of receiving crap product are similar in any form, always be careful even with the powder. But the powder is much cheaper than pellets so its better to buy that anyway. 


Disadvantage of both 5- and 6-APB is that it takes sooooo long to comeup and if you take too small initial dose, taking more after those 2-3 hours will never get you as high as if you took higher dose in the beginning. So theres always this risk of high body load if the product is crap.

Off-topic but you had chance to try the 5-APB HCl yet? Much faster come-up, kicking in hard at 30mins and pretty much peaking at +1hr insufflated. Makes a lovely combo with an oral dose of the 6 coming in fully at +2hrs to add a bit more of a psychedelic-esque  headspace and a little extra nonsense to the party. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Yeah, there is no way to know what was in that pellet. But I have a feeling that taking half of it may have resulted in good times. It simply felt like there was too much active ingredient in there. I'm not preaching against 6-apb, I just find it worrisome that there can be so much variation from one pellet to the next. 


I think some people like me who don't have a microgram scale will opt for pellets to try to be safe, when in fact it may indeed be much safer to get the powder if you can't trust the stated dosage of each pellet.

i took 6apb powder for a good year with no scale, always good times.


buy half a g, split into 4, wrap in a skin. theres roughly 125mg give or take 10mg which isnt that much of a difference when it comes 6apb anyway.


never buy pellets, waste of money

^^ you don't need a microgram scale, a milligram scale will surely suffice, considering the doses are pretty high.

180mg of a weaker batch down the hatch. Saved 15mg to snort on the peak. Should be fun.


I'll be interested to see how this compares to ~150mg because the only time I've gone higher was 250mg but I did that with 150mg + 100mg an hour later.

It's got some bite to it, will make your eyes water but nothing like ethylphenidate or something properly razor blade-ish / caustic like that, nowhere near. Quickly passes and not much drip, seems to get through the old nasal membranes quite easily. I did about 50mg snorted, 50mg oral with 100mg 6-APB oral and was pretty damn nice. Much faster first alert and initial bit of stimulation than I'd expect of 6-APB anyways, this being a first experiment with the 5 a coupla weeks back just as it started coming available from my supplier anyways.

I have insufflated crushed pellets before with very good results. I did try powder also this route but found it simply too much in volume and clumpiness.  Got annoying headache both times trying powder this way. Same powder in a drink was fine.  Amusingly the first time I crushed and sniffed a pellet I tried to keep it to myself.  Good times took over and next thing I am waking and looking in the mirror at two very turquoise nostrils. Lesson learned and mrs did not notice!

There tends to be tons of binders in the pellets though so I wouldnt snort those.

Is there any reason to think 6-APB might have MAOI properties? I seemed to experience considerable potentiation taking 4-ACO-DMT a couple of hours after 6-APB.

Is it not just the stimulant push from another serotonergic rather than any MAOI type action? 6-APB will push aMT quite hard dropped together with it, I find I have to stagger dosing to make the combo *'safe'*, 6-APB first and allowed to settle, then the aMT couple of hours in. Still more than the sum of its parts quite often that combo even then, have to dose lower than I would with each on their own. I don't think the exact pharmacology is fully understood yet but I was under the impression it was a fairly straightforward agonist at serotonin receptors, same as most other psychedelics in this class including the 4-AcO?

Hahaha, I done the exact same thing, exact same results. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) Like 6apbhmm says not a good idea. Lot of filler in there to bind up the pellet, as well as the dye. Found snorting 6-APB difficult, the succinate at least, none too pleasant or particularly easy to get up there in the amount I require. Not tried it with the 6-APB HCl yet.

Exactly this 6apb. It's pretty easy to eyeball half a g to a g, and even if your supplier's generous and your chopping out skills poor it's forgiving enough that 20-30mg over what you were aiming for ain't gonna suddenly put you into stupid territory. Would never ordinarily recommend eyeballing, especially with other psyches / stims like aMT for instance where 10-20mg over can be enough to produce wildly different effects to those anticipated but I have few concerns here.

You shouldn't be combining these two at all. aMT is an MAOI, so no wonder it causes major potentiation of 6-APB. There is a very real risk of serotonin syndrome with the combo you are suggesting.

It's pretty easy to eyeball half a g to a g, and even if your supplier's generous and your chopping out skills poor it's forgiving enough that 20-30mg over what you were aiming for ain't gonna suddenly put you into stupid territory. Would never ordinarily recommend eyeballing, especially with other psyches / stims like aMT for instance where 10-20mg over can be enough to produce wildly different effects to those anticipated but I have few concerns here.

what doses do you use for the amt/6apb combo?


i find amt very stimulating even at low doses so combining with another stim must be some crazy stimulation?

Taking each on their own, not comboing I usually do 250mg 6-APB, 100mg aMT, standard doses for me. Never, ever go higher than 100mg aMT come what may. Not a good idea for me. Deemed to be high doses for some people those anyways, the 6-APB at least. Comboed 150-200mg 6-APB, leave to fully peak, at least two hours till I know there's nothing left of the come-up to drive anything further, then 80mg aMT absolute max, sometimes I stay nearer 50mg if I'm just after adding visuals with a bit more of a psychedelic style headspace to the 6. 


Kinda depends what I want to be dominating the experience really, friendly, chilled-out stim or something more properly psychedelic. Serenely euphoric blissful stuff either which way, hugely so. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I love 6-APB and all, but I really think AMT should not be adulterated with anything. It's just such a fantastic drug, and from reading experiences it seems you can get a whole different experience from changing the dose alone.


I think both would be terrible at a club/rave, never mind a combo. 6-APB has music enhancement like no other, but felt very lazy. AMT was extremely trippy AND rolly at 55mg for me, and I had massive life-changing revelations. Thanks go to JesusGreen for being the final line of persuasion to fuel my curiosity for it. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

You might want to consider 6-APB + MPA for clubbing material. It makes a good combo. The MPA adds a cleaner, pushier stimulant hit to cut through what can be the perfectly chilled but quite lazy heaviness of the 6-APB just as you say. Nice synergy between the two, 6-APB suddenly becoming a lot more visual for someone who normally gets no visuals at all from it, and added enough energy and bounce to get the dancing shoes working. Not as much as with E though, it's no MDMA replacement. Comedown is rougher than the usual 6-APB comedown, really thick-headed and foggy, ok after a sleep. No suicide Tuesdays from it. If you do consider it be aware MPA is a methamphetamine analogue acting on the dopamine pleasure / reward system. Some addictive potential there perhaps.

True dat! Very different at different doses. Once you've played with those the attractions of other differences in combo become worthy of investigation though. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

Hello everyone ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


Are there any means of testing the substance to determine whether it's the real deal or not? Sending it to the laboratory is out of the question, unfortunately.


The thing is, a friend of mine recently purchased another batch of 6 apb and after testing 100mg, the effects comprised of a rather nauseous comeup, and after 1,5h of lying down on the bed, followed around 3 hours of being slightly alert, no visuals, no special feelings, barely no music appreciation, just the feeling of immense coldness and dilated pupils. 


After all the reading done on the effects of 6 apb this surely can't be the 'real stuff', although another friend claims the stuff looks the same as the last time they tried it and it was supposedly great...

^ 6-APB should show similar results to MDMA in Mecke and Marquis reagent tests - there's a lot of chemicals this wouldn't rule out, but if it doesn't show similar results you can rule out it being 6-APB for certain.


Do you have existing tolerance to MDMA or similar compounds? If you do this could substantially reduce effects. Also, 100mg for many people is not enough, it's usually enough to get a pleasant experience but not the strong intense rushes of amazing euphoria that people tend to find at higher doses. For me 150mg is my ideal dose.


It's also quite possible what you have is 6-APB but of a lower quality/impure, many people have reported poor effects from lower quality 6-APB at a medium-regular dose, but then when upping it to a high dose the effects are more consistent and better. I personally found weaker 6-APB to be disappointing at normal doses, but at slightly higher doses than higher quality stuff it produced similar results.

6-APB like MDA produces psychedelic effects and is expected to be a 5HT2A agonist, this should explain any potentiation.


Also, even combining the less psychedelic MDMA + Psychedelics, or even to some extent straight stimulants and psychedelics usually results in at least some potentiation of both drugs.


---


Also, smoked micro doses (repeated 1mg and 2mg doses) of aMT on the comedown of 6-APB - given that aMT technically shouldn't be much more of an MAOI than many drugs we don't regard as MAOIs like amphetamine, I figured attempting to smoke 1mg would be safe given with oral a good dose for me is 50mg - and it would not be dangerous at this level, similar to how even combined releasers and MAOIs like PMA and PMMA can be safe if taken at minute doses. 


After smoking 1mg I noticed some mild boost in effects but was still feeling the 6-APB comedown, so I waited approx 20-30 minutes to see how far the effects would build, then repeated this a few more times. After smoking around 10mg over a period of 3-4 hours the euphoria was back at a level similar to the 6-APB peak, albeit less rushy and more relaxed and calm, kind of more similar to MDMA. 


No symptoms of excess serotonin like hot flashes, nausea etc were noted - the level of euphoria increase with such low doses was rather surprising though.


I wouldn't recommend anyone trying this combination until we know more about the safety of it.


That said, a lot of people are doing this combo anyway, and if you must, I'd recommend the smoked ROA and working your way up using 0.5-1mg doses, as this way you're able to titrate your way to a safe dosage rather than eating an amount orally and it all hitting you at once - you can notice if the effects start getting unpleasant/too intense. Also, there was a lot of potentiation and as such, a few mgs smoked should be more than enough anyway.

Thanks for the answer! 


I was doing ecstasy approx. 8 years ago for less than a year. I thought about a higher dose but I'm afraid of the come up then - the nausea was awful enough already. Dunno, it just seemed weird to me that this would be the 'real thing'. :/ There was some 5-MeO-MipT about a month ago (14mg), could this be the problem?

Hey guys,


I'd like to hear your opinions about mixing 5-/6-APB in general and especially for the first experience with the APB-family. I'm experienced with several of the mdma analogues, both in good and very very bad ways. 

I'm thinking about trying 100 mg in total with a ratio of 50:50 or 60:40 (6-APB:5-APB) to keep it on the safe side (I'm really not the thinnest person so this should be an okay dose).


So, what are your experiences with this mix, is there a strong synergy (Are 50 mg each of 5- and 6-APB equal to say 100 mg 6-APB intensity-wise or maybe more?) or is taking them isolated maybe the way to go?


From what I've read so far it seems to be a great combination although I got the impression that negative side effects (like the ones leading up to serotonin syndrome with large doses) are a bit more likely to occur. But of course this is very subjective. I'd just like your take on this whole subject ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


Thanks, gonna keep you updated

I've only done the combo once so far, and it was with the 5-APB HCl now doing the rounds, not the previously available succinate. The HCl seems to have more oomph weight by weight according to some reports I've read. Obviously I can't make the comparison. 100mg 5 HCl half insufflated / half oral + 100mg 6 succinate oral was a very nice mix for me. It was certainly more than 200mg 6-APB on it's own which would tend to confirm relative potency somewhat. Not too much for me, but then I do 250mg 6-APB as a matter of course and have pushes as hard as 300mg ( verging too much there ).


Typical mixes I've seen quite a few users opt for is around 40% 5 / 60% 6, and then there are APB mix pellets doing the rounds which are 50mg 5 / 60mg 6 IIRC, not very far away from a similar ratio. General consensus based on my past reading seems to be dose the 5 a little lower than the 6, even with the succinate. As in all things, YMMV! Others will take a different view on relative dosing no doubt.


So, 60:40 split 6:5, 100mg total exactly as you suggest sounds very reasonable for a first experiment. You may find you need higher to get what you want from it but good starting point I would agree.


Few thoughts on the combo originally posted elsewhere:


> a cheeky little cocktail of ~100mg 5-APB, mostly insufflated, currently 2 hours in, with the addition of ~100mg 6-APB, oral at about +1hrs. Results so far are, shall we say, interesting. Quite noticeably coming up on it at the 30mins mark, quite strong effects felt at +1hr, and still climbing with the extra kick from the 6 now becoming more and more apparent.
> 
> 
> 
> Not quite what I expected. Still feels very subtle and gentle at that dose. I perhaps expected more, though tolerance from last weekends experiments would be one issue, and I generally dose really high with 6-APB as a rule also, single dose of 250mg would be average. Stimulation, mood lift are there, not so sure there's much energy to it though? No visual disturbances to speak of. No real patterning or colouration on surfaces for instance as yet, didn't expect there would be as get precious little of that from the 6. Not quite as euphoric or empathic ( entactogenic might be a better word here? ) as I'd have expected, though always difficult to fully test those qualities when you're sat at home on yer tod, ain't it? Need people and things to really test fully. I'm expecting the 6-APB to add to the nonsense quotient somewhat. Further reports in due course. 
> 
> 
> 
> +3.5hrs feels very much business as usual these last few hours now the 6-APB has made its presence known and settled down. It's got less of a mental space to it I'd say, 5 compared to 6. It's more straightforwardly stimmy. Got a good bit of jaw tension / gurning going actually now I think on it which I don't get too much of at all with 6 on it's own, even at higher doses, 250-300mg. Sweating a little more, occasional hot and colds exactly as I'd expect from pretty much any drug in this class, no biggie, no body load worth mentioning really to speak of. Just very, very chilled out, tunes sounding bloody good, having a little armchair boogie to myself of a night in on me own.

Will be a good few hours yet before I can sleep, sure about that, but on the whole a pretty smooth and enjoyable ride throughout, remarkably consistent in character. No real urge to redose now I'm coming down, know that would be a waste of good drugs would be more properly active again this time around next weekend. Didn't become massively much more visual, though there are tints and colour washes and the merest hint of a regular pattern overlaying itself and repeating across the surface rather than deep in the texture of things like you'd get with your 'classic' psychedelics.

Yeah, usually I'm not that cautious with dosages but I've read quite a lot of reports with signs of serotonin syndrome so I'd like to stay on the safe side for now. I've got both of them as succinate, so maybe I'll do a little adjusting but that's it. What I definitely want to avoid is redosing.


Thank you!

Tried the 6&5 combo over weekend. Brilliant times had. As usual in my bar/club environment. Was gonna be long night so shared 100mg 6apb and 50mg 5apb into 5 capsules and swallowed them at intervals over about 4hours. Few ciders over the course of night too. The 5 gives it that energy kick. Superb. No bad comedown either but no sleep until next afternoon.

I know, i asked this over and over (but never got a decent answer) but why is it, that i don't get the euphoria i knew from MDMA (for example) nowadays? Whatever serotogenic compound i may take, i feel there should be euphoria but it just isn't there - i'm stimulated, more chatty etc., but that's it - and no, i'm not awaiting too much! Is it possible for receptors to really change in a way, that doing serotogenics doesn't do a damn thing anymore? Can this happen with too much abuse in ones perhaps?


I mean i do get euphoric, with mxe for example, but it's an other kind of euphoria/happiness.


Thing is, i did the 6APB today the 2nd time ever (first time @60mgs just gave me headache; it's almost a year ago) and it was ok, like above said, i was more social/chatty (after the somewhat strange come-up), grinding my teeth etc., even my pupils are dilated like i haven't seen them years, but there's no euphoria.


It isn't really the problem of not having it, i'd be more interested in the reason why?

Tonight's the night.


Sooo considering my weight, having both of them in succinate form, your responses and quite a lot of reading I decided to go with 140 mg total with a 60:40 ratio of 6- and 5-APB ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


Let's see what these are made of.


EDIT: 2 hours have passed, reached a stable, but low plateau. A bit disappointing up until now

can't wait to try this again, in a great environment like a show or festival.  def beats taking nasty adulterated ecstasy pills, and people are right:  music enhancement is the true strength to be found here.

Well, Well...Never say never ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)


After 2 hours I got really impatient with the effects. They had already set in approx. 1 hour after ingestion, so nothing was happening which left a pretty bad feeling. The result: I redosed (slowly in a careful manner) and 1 hour ago I took ~110 mg 6-APB which are coming on right now...God damnit FINALLY what I was looking for ^^


EDIT: Holy shit, oooooh yes ^^ The initial 140 mg in total weren't even able to produce a kind of lasting, nice, low-plateau trip. Now I've got to 120 mg 5-APB and 230 mg 6-APB and finally the serotonin is rollin'

That would be a huge dose for me, when I tried it I was going to a free party in a club, put on by my mates! Anyway had 50mgs 5APB and 60mgs of 6APB! Come up just like md for me, slight anxiety but no jitteryness, the next four hours were filled with running round the club chatting to everyone I hadn't seen for a while! Normally whilst on md I keep myself to myself (honeymoon defo over) been eating md for 14 years! Anyway 6 hours after ingestion I thought it would be wise to have a cheeky line off mxe! Tut tut, this is when things got messy, I left the loo's and 15mins later I could feel mxe creeping on, had a girl sat on my lap kissing me, another 15mins pass and my mate describes me completely blanking this rather hot lady, I was apparently just staring at the bar, but my mate says nothing had changed, I could see barmaids dancing ontop of the bar and loads of flashing Christmas lights around them! Anyways I didn't come round til we were half way home only too be told I was kicked out for being too fucked(blasphemy)


Becareful mixing 5 & 6 APB in an unusual environment, being in a club is much different than ROLLING at home, it was pretty weird but enjoyable  none the less, but take lower doses still if you plan indulging in a bit of mxe, the results are Extremely Hallucinigenic!

Yeah it really is and somehow destroys some of its attractiveness for me, guess it must be my weight.


Am I understanding you right that you had some sort of "blackouts" when throwing mxe into the mix?

Redosing for me with 6-APB wasn't all that effective, while I find with MDMA it is. Anything less than half my initial dose and I pretty much won't feel it at all, and I have to get pretty close to my initial dose to get much of a boost. On the other hand, I don't notice any tolerance to the side effects, so if I were to follow through with your idea, I'd have the bodyload of a 180mg dose but with the high of say a 140mg one.


Personally I don't think this is the best drug to redose unless the 7-9 hour roll isn't enough for you and you really want to go a long ass time with it.


What exact problems did you have with the bodyload at 105mg? Bodyload can mean a lot of things, and there are often lots of ways to deal with them. E.g. diphenhydramine or ginger for nausea, magnesium for muscle tension - switching up whether you eat or not. 


I notice for me dosing on a full stomach with various drugs can lead to nausea and vomiting, and dosing while completely empty and very hungry can lead to stomach ache. A happy medium of being well fed but 2-3 hours since eating, or after a very light meal like a sandwich or two tends to be best.

I was nauseous, but not that bad, but felt me overall very agitated and messy, which subsided after approx. 1-2hrs. Reminded me a bit off coming up on shrooms/LSD. After that i was nicely, if not pretty much stimulated but without any euphoria, as said. 


Funny thing is, the day after i felt different, more open, empathic and so on. I was defo more talkative and funny when interacting with other people, normally i'm more the "talk is silver, silence is golden"-type of human ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


So what's your recommendation then? Upping the inital dose? To be honest, the lenght of the effects were more than enough for me, that's a factor i haven't considered with redosing.

6-APB is an MDA analogue, and as such, like MDMA and MDA, once you've got tolerance, it's going to stick for a very very long time, and "losing the magic" pretty much permanently is likely to be just as equally possible as with MDMA.


If you want to avoid tolerance, I'd advise you stick to taking 6-APB once a month at very most, ideally far less than that.


If you already have tolerance I'd suggest waiting 3-4 months before your next experience if you want to get the most out of it, depending on the level of tolerance that may be slightly more than enough time - or that may be far from enough.

Great info, thank you so much jesusgreen!  I love greens and the theory of jesus too, you must be an all around great individual.  Is there any literature on why permanent loss of that magic occurs (chemically or otherwise) that anyone knows of?  It pisses me off when such greatness is taken from me for seemingly no reason.

Noodle, in the short term use of serotonergics like MDMA, and presumably 6-APB will cause internalisation of serotonin receptors making them temporarily unavailable to new substances entering the system until they recycle back out to the surface of the cell. This is short-term tolerance, and why people tell you to leave at least a week between dosing say LSD and similar psyches. Repeated frequent use will cause down-regulation of serotonin receptor numbers over time. This is longer term tolerance,and a longer rest is needed at this point for receptor numbers to rebalance back out. In both cases you simply have fewer receptors available for your serotonergic DOC to activate. You also have potential neurotoxicity issues causing lasting damage which is not quite so recoverable from. Down-regulation and / or neurotoxicity likely account for the loss of magic and mood disorders frequently reported by heavy users of serotonergics like MDMA. The same mechanism is likely applicable here to the APBs.

> T+ 23:00 The rolling had been going on for a very long time now and I was feeling somewhat tired and the effects were wearing off, so we decided we would drop another small bomb each, this time around 50mg, said and done we dropped it and within an hour I felt some very strong warning symptoms, my legs started twitching, the sweating increased from what I am normally used to with high dosages of amphetamine and other stimulants including 6-APB, within 10 minutes I was in such a bad shape that I had to be helped to the bed, another 10 or so minutes passed until I realized what could have happened to me, and had happened to me, serotonin toxicity set in and in a desperate attempt to get help I got my rolling friend to call 911.

My heart was racing at 200 bpm, my blood pressure was up by 200/?(I will check these numbers once I get my hands on the medical report from the hospital) it took the ambulance roughly 40 minutes to get to my house and by the time they got here 3 patrol cars were already on the scene.

Seriously the adivce here is to not redose ever, unless the first dose was so low you dont feel it properly. This stuff is extremely dosage sensitive. Its not like MXE where you can take several more times than base dose and just lay in bed..

Thanks so much sepher!  Is down-regulation of serotonin 5-ht receptors also affected if you take 5-ht before and or after an mda-analogue?  I've read people say the hangover is less noticeable when you do this, but would taking 5-ht during this time make the effects of these drugs even less magic/euphoric over time?

good info sepher and jesus (if jesus was jew why the spanish name - John Cooper Clarke).  Anyway my question tonight is is there a difference between 125mg of powder and a 125mg pill.  I have had powder recently which I found underwhelming in some way, then I had a tablet that came free with a purchase.  I'd been working on about 180mg apb powder but found recent experiences as draining as good.  However the 125mg tablet has a much better effect and was deffo more enjoyable and I definitley felt 'warmer'.  I cant really imagine dosing higher with the powder as the drain is already quite heavy.  I am curious if there are 'additives' that make the BF tab so or is something else at work.  Ive been pretty consistent in not redosing more than once a month. 


Cheers for thoughts.

I'm assuming you're referring to 5-HTP, the serotonin precursor and supplement commonly used in post/preloads. 5-HT is serotonin itself, and not something people take in pill form for the hangover. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


Taking 5-HTP is going to increase your serotonin levels so I can't see any way this would possibly reduce downregulation - if anything I'd see it having the opposite effect and worsening it, but most likely I suspect it simply will have very little if any effect.


5-HTP is more for treating the depression etc, but personally I've never needed it.


Eat a low tryptophan & high carbohydrate diet and you can naturally boost your overall serotonin levels and speed up your recovery. 5-HTP just causes a short peak in your serotonin levels and as such I think the actual benefits people have reported from it are more placebo than anything else, imo - unless they're dosing the stuff constantly all day.

Sounds like the powder is lower quality and/or cut. It's also possible that the pill's dosage is understated - but this is very unlikely and usually the opposite is true. The finally candidate I'd say would be that you're eyeballing your powder and not really taking 125mg - the human eye is no substitute for a milligram scale - get one if that's the case.


You shouldn't really need as much as 180mg unless you already have a fair tolerance to MDMA related substances. I still find 150mg close to being too much sometimes and I've unfortunately really abused the drug over the last year.

cheers jesus for replying.  I have scales and measure the powder.  Ive faffed about with dosages over time but like many I suppose i am trying to find the sweet spot still.  Ive tried capping the powder, popping it in a rizla and chucking it in a drink.  The drink deffo came on quickest (like a train in one instance), but it tastes so rancid ive been trying to avoid that.  Also I like a Marlboro light binge when taking subs although i dont smoke usually, but smoking was way better when gelcapped or rizlad compared to the drink.  Complicated when all you want is a quiet night.  Ive never had any issues with my supplier and have about 9g 6apb at the moment, hence my question if someting could 'assist'.  Ive mentioned elsewhere I tried a 6/5 combo but really could not tell any difference.  I am tempted to chuck about 250mg in a drink next time and see what occurs?

6-APB is a strange animal... I tried various synths but none of them were really satisfying.. It definitely lacks a "push" and often brings me to a mellow but not happy low energy state.. Comedowns I noticed are much more gentle but can last up to a week. However, the lack of domanergic effects makes it easier to recover the energy, the mood however, it leaves in a pretty dark anhedonic territory. Dark chocolate and 5-HTP help to some extent to recover + daily exercise to get those natural endorphins going.

It's a strong substance but not well rounded and often times its effects are hard to pin-point, seem lacking but dosage increases may just leave a person more scattered / sick more than anything else.. It's better to not go over 80 mgs, the odds are more won't be better but worse. If at 80 mgs it is not good, higher dosage definitely will be worse.

I beg to differ. I found 100mg subtle and easy to handle, and quite underwhelming.

20 hours before I could even think about sleeping would be quite typical for me. Doses of 100mg or less would not even touch the sides. It's true there's diminishing returns as you push dose so 250mg isn't massively better than 200mg but enough to be noticeable, but 200mg is a lot stronger than 150mg, and that's quite a bit stronger than 100mg. I regularly dose 250mg friday, will stay awake through till saturday, long, long sleep, lazy sunday then fine for monday back to the real world. No suicide tuesdays so far. I'd barely call it a comedown. Dose / response is very, very variable with this stuff it seems, effects very subjective.

20 hours? Is this with redoses? Even with 250mg I was able to sleep after 12-13 hours. I've never noticed it taking longer than that, and I'm quite sensitive to the sleep-blocking effects of stimulants in general - e.g. unable to sleep for 12-14 hours after a single snorted 5mg dose of MDPV.

I can generally sleep exactly 12 hours from the time I drop 6-apb. Never sooner, it's always the same time as I dropped when I finally doze off, but with the AM/PM flipped...

no redosing at all. Most effects are gone and I would feel fine the next day and I can get on with it as if I have had sleep, but there's not a chance my head will hit the pillow until the next night generally

I had a bad trip on 6-apb the last time I took it with a friend (I've used it a few times before). I ordered it from the same supplier as before and all had been good in my previous trips. I did eye ball the amount we both took and I was sick upon the come up. I'm thinking I could have overdosed, but I'm not too sure. We both had a bad trip too, not just me. What do you guys think?

I'm thinking overdose for sure.  When I dose over 200 mg of 6-apb the nausea can get pretty bad at points. The trick to not over/under dosing is to buy a scale. You can get them cheap. You'll have better experiences and you'll be safe. Even if your mother doesn't know you do drugs, she'd appreciate it if you do it safely. Some of these drugs can kill you. Please buy a scale and use it. Your life may depend on it.


Something I noticed with 6-apb, it seems to expand as it ages. I have mine stored in 3 bags and an envelope at room temperature. When I first got it I could fit 200mg in a capsule easy. Now its a struggle to get 150mg in the same capsules. Absorbing water maybe? Maybe your old batch was just that, old. So, the new batch may have looked like the same dose, but been a lot more. Also, 5-apb seems a lot denser than 6-apb.

I'm no chemist and my understanding is limited so have come up with this reading around and seeing how Olanzapine's mechanism of action compares with Mirtazipine's which I'm more familiar with. Be nice if someone else could comment to check that I understand things correctly here, but . . . 


Olanzapine's antagonism of 5HT2a/5HT2c where 6-APB is believed to bind and of dopamine D1/D2 receptors that come into play with dopamine release due to 6-APB's 5HT2a agonism with an average half life of ~30 hours? I would think it most certainly would diminish it to some extent, yes. Mirtazipine with a similar mechanism of action as an antagonist binding to 5HT2s can very effectively diminish the effects of psychedelics IME, I think through receptor blockade proper and / or tolerance caused by internalisation of receptors. Even after the Olanzipine's out of your system there's going to be some remaining tolerance caused by the internalisation.

5mg of Mirtzapine ( well below a therapeutic dose normally ) used as a one off for the first time in months as a sleep aid almost completely blocked 1.1mg of 25I-NBOMe a day later, barest threshold effects. Another attempt at it five days later produced very little improvement due to residual tolerance. Why am I banging on about Mirtazipine and NBOMes when you're asking about Olanzapine in the 6-APB thread i hear you cry, which is a good question, so let me answer it as best I can. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png) Mechanism of action for both are I believe sufficiently similar for 5HT2s at least to make for a valid comparison. Make of the what you will. Others may take a different view. I guess you could still get effects depending what sort of doses of Olanzapine and 6-APB we're talking about, feel it would be difficult to say to what extent they'd be diminished.

Thanks for the reply! I'm usually careful with the does, but something obviously went wrong this time. Definitely going to get a scale, will be a lot better I'm sure! To be honest when I got that batch I thought it looked a tiny bit different, but nothing hugely significant. Then again maybe I was analyzing it too much. 


Anyways, thanks for the help!

Has anyone else had some crazily potent 6-APB lately? Purchased 500mg last weekend, looked a little less based on my experience with the powder but I purchased it at the bar I was drinking at from a friend and didn't fancy the trek home for scales - split the entire amount between 6 people, one person didn't feel the effects (only had a tiny lick) but all 5 others rolled crazy hard, one said it was her most euphoric drug experience to date, another said it was one of his best, two others were real fucked up and me.. Well I was also on 1mg Buprenorphine so it was also my most euphoric experience to date.


What was odd though was that I've taken great quality 6-APB before up to 250mg and the only visuals I've gotten are a little wavyness around the edges of objects, some brightening, and some colourful cartoon CEVs - maybe a tiny blur.. But that night my vision was so blurred I was literally blind at some points and had to be dragged around half the night because I couldn't see properly.. 


Walking around the town after we came out looked like this:


![images](https://www.bluelight.org/community/proxy.php?image=http%3A%2F%2Ft3.gstatic.com%2Fimages%3Fq%3Dtbn%3AANd9GcRmANrKjOhuqzHQ66hSX3ox7duSfjFKLudMf8Tf6qBslkFDFnFX8ix28adjWA&hash=b34d64e01ab832ad18c6146ec5420fd3)


Thankfully we stayed together as a group so I didn't get loss or stumble off into any ditches/alleys or anything. Went to a friends place and stayed there until I sobered up.


I noticed that my peak lasted a lot longer too but that might have been the bupe, I didn't have any sort of noticeable comedown or hangover other than feeling tired the next day (but I get that with bupe anyway) which was also unusual for me since 6-APB is usually harsher for me, and I'd dumbly even taken it a week before.


I can't see it having been another drug though it felt identical to 6-APB just far far stronger than normal. Was one of the best nights of my life ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) 


In hindsight there could have been more powder than we thought but unless my friend got the bags mixed up he said he weighed it up just before we came out to just over 500mg - and there was still a good 70-80mg or so left in the bag (still is) by the end of the night, which I'll save for maybe come January when my local re-opens :D


Weird because even 250mg didn't come close to that strength and for 5 people to roll that hard, another to take a dose, and there to still be 70-80mg left, from "just over 500mg", is crazy for me.


Guess either my friend made a mistake or the previous 6-APB on the market wasn't as pure as we thought. Either that or low doses oddly act stronger, since I did have that one roll where I took 80mg and rolled harder than 250mg. Iunno, all weird, but felt like posting it in case anyone else had similar experiences.


For reference the 6-APB was off-white rather than the usual tan I'm used to, which in the past has been a bad sign with 6-APB but in general with chemicals is normally a good thing, so maybe it is a sign the purity has gone up. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


(ps don't jump into batch discussion with this, I'm commenting on the overall synthesis purity, since I've never tried any 6-APB that was this strong before, and asking if anyone else noticed a similarity - NOT for you to comment on individual batches and such please! ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png))

Ive only ever had one batch of 6-apb and found it incredibly strong. 

My first time trying it i did 100mg and rolled pretty good. Physically i felt like i was rolling very hard but i didnt get much of the emotional effects i love with MDMA and Methylone (and even mephedrone is more empathetic IME). I also didnt get visuals like people had been claiming to. So i felt like i should push the dose up the next time.

 The second time i took 150mg. Again physically i rolled very hard. Too hard really as i vomited several times through out the night and into the next day. I also felt lingering effects all of the next day and couldnt do anything but drink water and take short naps. I wish i had a benzo or an opiate for that next day because i seriously felt like shit. But i was also pretty drunk when taking it this time so i feel that played a big role in making me feel ill and also not allowing to enjoy this experience. Some positives of this second experience were some nice visuals and mild head trip like you would get from a low dose of a 2c-x but combined with the sort of physical rushes you would get from a high dose of MDMA. 

Next time i plan to take 150mg again but while sober and with a little food in my belly because i tend to vomit from drugs like these at high doses.

For comparison, i like to take 200-250mg of MDMA in one bomb and i found my 150mg 6-apb experience to be every bit as strong as that (but again i cant be sure because i was pretty drunk when i took it). It completely lacks any empathetic effects though IME, which is unfortunate because thats my favorite effect from empathogens, go figure ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png).

I find the empathy to be quite high with 6-APB, but 5-APB and MDMA certainly beat it in that aspect. Not by a whole lot though, and at higher doses the differences aren't really noticeable, and it comes down to it more being a case of me wanting to get up and do things on 6-APB while on MDMA I'll be more happy to lay around just cuddling the whole time. I find it interesting you found Methylone more empathogenic though, I honestly got little empathy from Methylone (even in combo with 2C-B!) and to me it felt more like a cross between a strong DARI like MDPV or Cocaine - and MDMA, but far more rushy and far less lovey.


It's weird though, the time I took 250mg was from the place I'd trust most of all to get the stuff from, and this most recent dose was randomly given to me by a friend who got it EXTREMELY cheap, like ridiculously, to the point that I expected it not to work (can't mention specifics though, no price discussion!) and never told me where he got it from, so it was odd for it to be so much better by a mile.


I wondered if maybe this is the freebase form and the previous form was one of the salts? I'm not sure though, I think I remember hearing 6-APB freebase was an oil, but I might be remembering that wrong.

Jesus would it be possible for you to perform a reagent test on the 6-apb you took? You could compare it to reagent test results you may have performed for other batches of 6-apb in the past or compare it to other reagent test results found around the web. Me for example I have a 6-apb that tested dark green/black with mecke (I forgot the result i got with marquis). I have yet to try it because according to other people's results those results are incorrect, and I'm concerned that I may be taking something cut with a more dangerous substance like PMA or something else. It would be interesting to know if the variable between these batches and the potency has to do with purity/cutting or even completely different substances possibly. The only other way to test this would be to get an analysis at the lab but that's a bit more troublesome..

My latest supplies of the succinate form are only just off white / cream and I've noticed no difference in potency compared to the previous tan batches. Seems identical in every way JG. Could it be the much promised HCl at long last? It's apparently due if not here already? HCl is white isn't it? I dunno if the higher potency of HCL to succinate for 5-APB equally applies here? Anyone know?

My understanding also is that 6-APB freebase is an oil at room temperature, available in succinate and HCl forms only for our purposes at least? Hence the pondering above. I know some UK vendors have been threatening HCl for the last few months, not sure if it is in fact yet available from them. Short of emailing them to ask I'm trying to find the answer to my own question above elsewhere also. Will come back if I get one JG.

Not by a whole lot though, and at higher doses the differences aren't really noticeable, and it comes down to it more being a case of me wanting to get up and do things on 6-APB while on MDMA I'll be more happy to lay around just cuddling the whole time. I find it interesting you found Methylone more empathogenic though, I honestly got little empathy from Methylone (even in combo with 2C-B!) and to me it felt more like a cross between a strong DARI like MDPV or Cocaine - and MDMA, but far more rushy and far less lovey.

i havent had 5-apb yet but would like to try it if it has more empathy. I found 6-apb and MDMA similar in that they both monged me out. I couldnt imagine going out on 6-apb because of how strongly it affected me. i would prefer it at home at night with some music and friends and/or my gf.

I agree that methylone feels like cocaine and MDMA but i still feel strong empathogenic effects from it like i would from MDMA.


Is it possible you could have gotten 5-apb which is more potent by weight.

Another attempt at it five days later produced very little improvement due to residual tolerance.

I guess you could still get effects depending what sort of doses of Olanzapine and 6-APB we're talking about, feel it would be difficult to say to what extent they'd be diminished.

Interesting. Been discussing this elsewhere just today. 5 feels more straightforwardly stimmy to me, as if more dopaminergic. I like the serene and swimmy serotonin feeling I get from 6 more, feels more of a psyche than a stim to me and certainly more entactogenic / empathogenic than 5. This seems at odds with both others' experience, and the chemistry at play which others have led me believe suggests it should by the 6 which is the more domapinergic, 5 more serotonergic. 


Theory: I wonder if the actual balance of neurotransmitters to receptors in a particular individual is what might account for differences in subjective effect, how up or down regulated one system is relative to the other for example? Any thoughts?


**EDIT:**


Jesus, I can take no credit for the quality of the research here, nor am I qualified to comment on its accuracy, but I trust the source to have done his sums correctly. Further to idle musings on whether you might have finally seen the much vaunted and alleged to be imminent HCl at long last:

Now if my maths is correct what that means is, very approximately, 6-APB HCl should be ~38% stronger weight for weight than the succinate. Would that be on a par with what you felt, or wrong ball park altogether?

Well, if the experience I am about to recount suggests there has been a recent increases in strength of 6-apb, it might explain a thing or two.


I have a history of stim/entactogen use after discovering Ecstacy in the early 90's. I've never really overdone it much so I've got a pretty clean slate & I'm small & I've always been ultra-sensitive to psyches, stims & entactogens.


I got some 5-apb & some 6-apb at the around the same time that the hcl version of 5-apb appeared. At some point over the last few months I performed an allergy test with a equal combination totalling 5mg. Obviously I had no effect. However, more recently I began what I expected to be a protracted attempt to find a comfy level for this material. I capped up 10mg of 6-apb & 5mg of 5-apb, ratio roughly as per Jesus instructions, taking into account the supposedly stronger 5-apb. I popped the cap & went to work as a cleaner, genuinely expecting no effects. 


Effects surpriesed me. I felt no obvious come-up, which may have been awlward at work, but suddenly noticed I was feeling quite chilled, relaxed & confident. I was talkative with my client & felt more at ease doing so than I might usually. My skin felt warm, & sensitive such as with a mild dose of mdma. I felt vaguely spaced out & noticed a small degree of tracers & slight brightness to things generally. Despite working hard physically, I did not notice any obvious stimulation but honestly, who would've expected ANY effects at such low dosings. I'll be upping those doses next time, but not by much, I'm very interested in what I can get from loew doses. Though subtle for sure, they were certainly present, certainly pleasant, lasted some hours, & I'm quite pleased ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


Would the effects I've highlighted in red constitute pretty much what would be expected from a small dose of 5-apb/6-apb combo?

That's interesting Si. I've only done so very low a dose the once, ~30mg maybe when a package arrived at work in the morning post was burning a hole in my pocket!  Had a little general mood lift, very, very slight increase in energy, but with a little blurring of focus though. No visual effects whatsoever but this was 6-APB only, get precious little even at high doses. The 5/6 combo is a tad more visual, there's a good synergy there greater than the sum of its parts with them clearly but still very subtle: the vaguest hints of tints / colour washes inclining towards a soft, rosy pink glow to things and a softening of edges, a kind of vibrational intensity to things and occasionally a little patterning and increased definition in textures that allow for it. Phosphene patterns with eyes closed are perhaps more apparent but still *just* phosphenes.

... again, interesting. I love MDMA & I'm sure I've had MDA dressed as Estacy in the past so because there isn't an awful lot of info's about the apb's around the internest, despite the apparent widespread use, I've been reading up on the effects of MDA instead. I'm hoping that the similarity in structure that both the apb's share wth MDA coupled with correct dosage & combination balance of 5-apb & 6-apb I might replicate some or all of these effects. I am of course looking for the lowest possible dose to find a comfortable place that doesn't last too long or bring about some awful, endless come-down. My sero-system hasn't been worked too hard over recent months so I'll be warming up the apb's again soon & I shall report back.

It's close to MDA I think but not quite. My experience of MDA was with snowball Es doing the rounds early 90s, reckoned to be about 200mg+ MDA. Feeling of the 5/6-APB combo is somewhat similar though I believe MDA still had the more push. It was decent raving material in a club with enough energy. Saw The Orb support Primal Scream on them, I will leave you to guess at the euphoria produced rocking along to that! ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

I can concur with the stronger APB findings, as I dropped a 60mg 6APB/50mg 5 APB pellet recently, and was absolutely flying compared to the same dose of APB that was taken a few months prior. Ended up with me sitting on the toilet at 3am, gurning my face off and smiling to myself.

my girlfriend and i love this stuff. just around 90 mg of material and you get a nice, long-lasting (~2 hour come-up, 6-8 hour peak, 8-12 hour come-down; easy to sleep thru with just a bit of etizolam or xanax), euphoric, mildly psychedelic experience with no desire to re-dose and no crash the next day. a perfect compound for those of us who enjoyed mdma and mda in our "youth" but prefer something with a bit milder touch (albeit, a bit more of a psychedelic than an empathogen) in our "old age"!! in our opinion, this is the cream of the crop of contemporary research chemicals (though we haven't yet tried 5-apb, or combinations of the two). we've bioassayed samples from a couple of different vendors recently, and the quality of product has been great. highly recommended!! for optimum use of material, i'd suggest once a month dosing at the maximum; a trip after only two weeks off didn't quite have the same intensity of effects.

@Sepher: I can't really say I'm sure. For my experience to be so much stronger than my prior 250mg experience, with me having consumed far less, I'm not sure the 38% improved potency figure would be accurate. Then again, it's not far out, and the disparity could be due to differences in purity on top of the different salt formulation. 


On a good note, when I finished the bag, I assumed I put it in my pocket, but later couldn't find it, only to be handed an almost 6-APB bag by the guy who gave me it.. But I later found another one in my pocket, so seems like they were different bags, and if this one also has 70-80mg or so in it then I have at least one full dose :D

I find 6-APB similar to MDA, which is not surprising given the similarity in their chemical structure. What interests me though is whether we may one day see N-methyl-6-APB, which is to MDMA what 6-APB is to MDA. It seems reasonable to assume that this chemical would have effects quite similar to MDMA.

There is one confirmed 5-APB report at ecstasydata.org, as something pressed and sold as ecstasy. The marquis and mecke is purple (which would be similar to MDMA / MDA, purple -> black).


No confirmed 6-APB tested there yet, but I would expect 6-APB and 6-APBD to be similar.

What is the difference between 6apb and apdp? My all time fave tipple is a mix of 5 and 6 apb, and bought some pressed pellets that were supposed to be a 5/6 combo, but the label says its a 6apb and 6apdp mix. Might not be true, but if it is, what can I expect? Any different from 6apb alone?

Purchased 500mg last weekend, looked a little less based on my experience with the powder but I purchased it at the bar I was drinking at from a friend and didn't fancy the trek home for scales - split the entire amount between 6 people, one person didn't feel the effects (only had a tiny lick) but all 5 others rolled crazy hard, one said it was her most euphoric drug experience to date, another said it was one of his best, two others were real fucked up and me..

Yes! With my batch of 6-APB, I was completely faced from 100mg. I'm talking crazy eye wiggles that made it hard to see anything, jaw grinding, incredible euphoria... And the come-down was pretty easy, with virtually no hangover the next day. The friends I did it with were visibly rolling balls, they loved it. This is the good stuff! 


This stuff is pretty white and fluffy with a flour-like consistency.

the chemical you are thinking of is probably 6-APDB, it's a less saturated variant on 6-APB (with perhaps somewhat fuzzier legal status in the USA), if you type the two into wikipedia you can see the difference in structure. i've never tried APDB, no clue on the dosage level, but i'd expect the effects to be fairly similar to 6-APB.

My experience with this substance so far has consisted of near weekly doses of 150mg bombed, followed by two 100mg doses administered rectally, with each dose spaced 6 hours apart. Spaced through the night I insufflate the odd micro-line of mdma totalling 60mg for the night.


I notice no degradation of effect between redoses and find each dose builds up to a wonderful psychedelic experience lasting 24 hours or so.


I am also noticing no severe comedown, nor diminished effects from the weekly experiments. I took a week off recently to see if there would be any stacked comedown but found there was none.


This compound seems too good to be true. No tolerance between redoses, or none that I can detect, no comedown, and seemingly repeatable on a weekly basis. Bit too good perhaps, considering a forced break for a few weeks to see if there is any sinister side effects.

Wow, it's astounding you had so much 6APB without feeling wiped out for a few days or depressed. But maybe that's just me.


I do agree, though, that you can keep taking it and it will prolong or build the trip.

that's interesting, i found it to be completely the opposite for me, fairly pointless to re-dose - better to just load up a little heavier dose up front - and i definitely need > 2 weeks to feel the full magic of it again following a night of use. also, i find dosing more than 120-150 mg in a single session to mostly be chasing diminishing returns. beyond that point, you're taking double the quantity of chemical for 10% more effects... really, 90 mg in a single session for me (~140-160 lbs male) is a good, solid trip while making conservative use of my material stock.

I also find redosing to be pointless. 7 day break minimum is required for me to feel effects the next time. 200mg is far superior to 150mg, I can say that for sure! I have no desire to go higher.

I find redosing works great with 6-apb. I'll dose 150mg orally then another 150mg orally about 4 hours later with no diminished effects. 


I do get a pretty sinister come down though. I'm tired, my whole body aches, and GI distress is an understatement. The day after even one dose, I'm useless. Its about the same as an mdma come down, but with mad diarrhea. It lacks the suicide Tuesdays though, which is nice. 


I guess your mileage may vary. Be extra careful using this compound too often! It could be destroying your brain! ![8o](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eek.gif)

Terrible timing , but I've run out of 6apb powder. I've got some 6apb pellets tho that I've had sitting for a while. 125mg supposedly. Never tried pellets. They usually pack the same punch as equivalent amount of powder?

^if the pellets really contain the amount you were told to then yes, it's exactly the same. I actually had my best (and one of the first) APB nights on pellet. But the obvious issues is that vendor can lie to you but it's worth trying for sure!

It's from the same place I've bought powders from with much success. So , trustworthy (as they can be I suppose ) . I've got 5apb powder still so can throw a bit into the mix too if needed ?

i don't really get any sort of crash whatsoever from using 6-apb; i feel fine and have plenty of energy afterward, but the one side effect i always do get is massive diarrhea; it's a stronger laxative than even malt liquor!! i always thought it had something to do with serotonin activity in the gut.

Be careful. After short time of a couple of months this may disappear if you keep going on dosing every week.

I can confirm this. After 4 weeks there really was nothing left, had to take several months off for a break. This is where cannabinoids come extremely useful, 'cause you can cycle your tolerance resets.

Yup! Higher serotonin levels increase intestinal motility and mucosal secretion. [[LINKY]](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17195902) Visit to the porcelain throne shortly after taking anything serotonergic very common for me, as is diarrhoea a day later. aMT far and away the worst for this, absolutely tears through my insides but the APB's sometimes run a close second at high doses. Loperamide FTW!

Yup again. It would be reasonable to expect downregulation of serotonin receptors over time with prolonged repeated use, as per other serotonergic drugs like MDMA etc.

6-APB is believed to have a method of action similar to MDMA, so one should expect an SSRI to have the same effect on 6-APB.


I can't remember the exact quote but the best advice i have heard about mixing empathogens and antidepressants was along these lines: "if you are on an SSRI, presumably you have some sort of difficulty with seratonin regulation so you are best to avoid powerful seratonin releasers due to the possible rebound depression."

of course I understand that SSRIs are over-prescribed. i do not mean to imply that you have a serious mental disorder.

i was very excited to try mdma after discontinuing an SNRI but in the end the high was not worth the rebound depression for me.

While letting your tolerance to serotonin-acting drugs level out, you can smoke cannabinoids/cannabis. I'm not a daily (or even regular) weed smoker, and I always give time for my tolerance to rock bottom to the floor. There was a period when I smoked daily for a few months, but it got seriously expensive and I became incredibly lazy.


And by the time your tolerance to weed/synthetics has sky-rocketed, wehey, time for some more 6-apb.

Anyone combined 6-apb w/ methylone? I am planning on taking 110mg of 6-apb at a festival on NYE that will last ~6 hours. However, there is an afterparty that I want to go to and was wondering if it was safe to take 160mg of M1 about 6hrs after taking 6-apb? The only reason I want to take the m1 is to bump me back into party mode when otherwise I will be starting to comedown off of the 6-apb by then.

Just did 180mg, not pure but i would say decent quality. Third time ever taking it, first time above 100mg.

Dosed at 4am this morning, it's now 10pm (18 hours) and my pupils are fully dilated - not as much as they normally are on most stims but i have little blue left. Was drinking from 8pm->3am but not drunk just kind of tipsy.

no CEVs, had very little all day but still getting OEVs in the form of petronas' - ghost/smoke dogs, pugs, cats, foxes, bull and huge sleeping arab guy? My bedsheets also look like they're moving which is pretty cool. Have to purposefully lose focus in my eyes though, but they are interactive as in they assplode if i reach out to touch them, or they turn away from it. Very real looking. Seem to originate from my blue walls/blue bed sheets only.

Do people get this kind of thing as well?

Nope, I see no reason why there would be a problematic interaction from therapeutic doses of lyrica. The sedative effects may counter the stimulant effects a bit but there's nothing you wouldn't expect.

Yup, I think it was August but it may have been September. The initial 6-APB doing the rounds was poor quality, and it took a good few months until it got to an acceptable level.

Yep,summer of 2010,the (horribly named)benzo-fury pellets hit the streets. I remember going camping that summer twice and taking 6-apb each time. I had a lot of fun.

First effects appear at about 0:30 followed by a rise up to a peak at 1:30, a plateau for 4-5 hours, and then a gradual decline to baseline at about 12:00. Adding an alcoholic drink or two between 2:00 and 5:00 adds a nice color to the experience. Psychedelia is pretty limited at this dose, as is the nausea, but empathy, mood elevation, and sensory enhancement are all present.

70mg is about half of what I need for a euphoric trip. Perhaps I'm not getting pure stuff. 70 gives me some energy and a little empathy but barely dilates my pupils & doesn't last long.

Naw Morkin, it's more likely that 6-APB just has a pretty broad dose range than it is anything to do with quality. I've had it from a few vendors now and it's all been much of a muchness. 70mg wouldn't touch the sides for me, wouldn't even bother with less than 150mg but that would be a low dose for me and somewhat disappointing being nowhere near where I want it to be. By choice I dose at 250mg and still seem to get a lot less than a lot of others seem to get far as the more psychedelic effects go at least. It's all very subjective and individual AFAICS.


Is everyone else finding 6-APB thin on the ground. Heard there's an export problem with bulk suppy?

Seems to be about the same as MDMA for me. I use both very moderately and both give an unpleasant feeling that I am somewhat unable to cope with life in the following days.

Yes - 2 to 3 days later I will experience depression that will last for a day or two. 


However, if I'm using 6APB regularly, there is little to no depression, but also, little to no euphoria during the high.

I have several friends whose eyes get quite dilated with 70 mg! On the other hand, my eyes don't dilate very much with this or other phenethylamines, even psychedelics at clearly active doses.


One thing I have noticed is that I have a weaker reaction than most people I know to most empathogens (MDMA, MDAI, 6-APB) from the same dose and same batch of material. I've pushed MDAI up to 300 mg, where I get distinct brain zaps before I get any overtly psychedelic effects (e.g. visuals). Even with MDMA at 125 mg, the effects I feel are mild at most. I've come to appreciate these drugs as "enhancers" rather than distinct trips in and of themselves and with my adjusted expectations have come much more enjoyable experiences.

Interesting - could you detail those negatives at all?


5-APB is definitely worth trying. For me, it is a lot like 6, only more energising - which also make me more effusive, socially.

**plugging**


on NYE I was aiming for a solid ++ and plugged 80mg (expected effects of ~150mg oral), followed by another 15mg @t+30min after I couldn't hold in the first shot any longer... ![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif)

I usually try to plug every substance and for many it is my favorite ROA but this one gave me immediate negative reactions to my GI-system. the only other time I experienced that was when I foolishly plugged icecold ethanol-water-MXE solution and suffered like I dog for hours ![:o](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f631.png)... so I was already like "nice, here we go: agonizing colon cramps while peaking on powerful psychedelic substances"...popped 2 loperamides, and was relieved with the 6-apb effects slowly (!) emerging and GI issues slowly subsiding.

anyway: there was no rush and potency was hardly increased (felt like 120-130mg) - but god knows how much of the dose was lost due to the nearly instant diarrhea.


sure I was underwhelmed but even underdosed 6-apb is still a nice substance. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) (underdosing it makes me very introspective/withdrawn though. not perfect for partying..)


don't know if I give this another try.

I wouldn't worry too much about nutrients. So long as you eat properly normally, your body can easily go days without food so long as you're drinking plenty of water. Staying hydrated is the key issue, don't you think?

Think we all get grumpy if we ain't fed during normal conditions, but grumpy on an empty stomach & apb just don't happen :D  I personally start winding down the food intake about 8 hours before I start an apb sesh, and start again about 24 hours later. I seem to function better! No nausea for a start.

Depends what intensity you're looking for. As with MDMA, the higher you push the dose, the more stimulating it gets. I would suggest about 100-120mg in a calm home setting where you are looking to gauge the substance and don't need a high intensity experience.

yeah 125mg perfect for indoors, i like to follow it up with another 100mgs about 2 hours in, the  high lasts that bit longer plus the visuals and trippiness starts to shine through alot stronger, not too stimulating either. weed is a must too

Does anyone have specific tips or suggestions on how to avoid the nausea while coming up? I personally handled 75mg (in "pellet" form) just fine, although I had the urge to gag a few times while talking for the first hour or so, but my girlfriend has been nauseous to the point of having to sit in one spot and maybe watch TV for at least an hour after taking it. This happened with 50mg and 75mg... So now she's wary about taking it before going out. She enjoys the trip, just not getting there. 


So, any suggestions? Besides plugging it... Maybe crushing it and parachuting it so it's dissolved into the system faster? Dissolved into some seltzer maybe? Maybe stagger 75mg into 3 doses taken 30 min or so apart? I have lots of ideas, but I'm curious what's worked for other people.

Staggering doses is usually pretty effective for most things. Some freshly sliced ginger tea is always good an lemon essential oil is also supposed to work, although I haven't tried it.

Nor me Morkin, none worth mentioning really on any of the APBs. 


Wintermute, Transform's right on ginger but doesn't even need to be fresh. Half a teaspoon dried ginger powder in some hot water was very effective for aMT come-ups, part of my little pre-dosing arsenal along with Loperamide. Works wonders.

I only say fresh because I've read that powdered is less effective. Never tried it since fresh ginger is cheap and it's nice to slice it thinly and have made it yourself.

Sleep will be hard without a downer (avoid alcohol for that, too dehydrating). Expect at least 12 hours stimulation. At baseline, half a zopiclone will put me to sleep (I'm not a habitual user, just keep it around for 6-apb downers or rare nights when neighbours are loud), but I'll need about 3 to end a strong (120mgs +) 6-apb come-down (usually 1 to get sleepy, 1 an hour later to get to sleep, 1 again on waking up after 4 hours).


Pupils will dilate. Higher doses make me look like a cartoon character (& I fucking love it, it is so funny - I love interacting with people in  slightly ridiculous way with this face & feel like I can be quite cheeky, heh).

Hmm, really need to stretch out a day for this I see. Too bad I don't have acces to benzo's, I'm just looking to test it though, see how I react to it. Will 50 mg's keep me stimulated for 12 hours aswell?

Less of an issue with the APBs but pretty much any serotonergic will go right through me. AMT is a bitch for it, countless visits to the porcelain throne passing pure liquid waste. Not pleasant. With the APBs and others it's less of an issue while I'm high but the next day is bad for it again, so depending what I'm taking I'll either pre-dose, or dose once well into come-down territory.

I agree. I've had the slops the day after APB times. Not terrible, nor pain, but a bit of a nuisance. I don't do anything about it though, except drink water.

Anyone ever had 6-apb powder that doesn't have THAT smell? Every previous lot I've had had that strange marmite/fishy smell / taste, and was tan in colour. This new batch was white, and no smell or taste at all. Was a bit worried about it. Anyway me and a mate gulped down 30mg each and headed to the pub. Pretty dam potent! We normally go through 200mg each or so on a night clubbing so are well used to it. But this was like having around 75mg of previous stuff. Handle with care ?

Purchased 500mg last weekend, looked a little less based on my experience with the powder but I purchased it at the bar I was drinking at from a friend and didn't fancy the trek home for scales - split the entire amount between 6 people, one person didn't feel the effects (only had a tiny lick) but all 5 others rolled crazy hard, one said it was her most euphoric drug experience to date, another said it was one of his best, two others were real fucked up and me.. Well I was also on 1mg Buprenorphine so it was also my most euphoric experience to date.

Hi jesus, just a guess but in all fairness it might not me that far from the truth, might it have been 5-MABP? Have had a batch recently and 80mg was on par with a +150mg 6-apb roll, I too had a lower dose opiates in my system atm and rolled superhard as you and had one of the top nights of my life. Afain, just a thought. But the effects were indeed VERY similar to a full on 6-apb trip,

This right here is the truth, for those prone to crash after a roll the lyrica pretty much kills any such symptoms.

6-apb/lyrica is one of me personal top 3 mixes ever after all these years. Pointless info but yer welcome. Enjoy that apb folks!

I think this batch was around before 5-MAPB announced. A crazy potent batch I have (sounds similar to all recent reports) *has* been tested / confirmed to be *an* APB (via GC/MS). Furthermore, I imagine that 5-MAPB should have a positive Simons test; this batch tested negative.


The speculation I've heard is that this latest batch to go around was a HCl salt vs. the fumarate, which would explain some of the potency kick. I have no idea how one could verify this though.

Yes, is it possible this was 5-APB which is known to be more potent? Many more difficult mistakes have been made in the past, these two are pretty easily confused by every spectroscopic method, label, structure diagram etc. A slip in the naming at any stage could go unnoticed through the chain.

It could certainly be 5-APB; A friend had his 6-APB tested in lab and the result was: 95 % 5-APB. And it was sold as 6-APB by an online vendor.

5-APB HCl certainly has a lot more oomph mg for mg than the 6-APB succinate available up to now, it's a pushier stim all round, 6-APB HCl has finally come available UK from a couple of vendors I think now at last and that's expected to be a lot more potent weight by weight than the previously available succinate stuff too. Only had 5-MAPB once but don't think I would confuse it with 6-APB's tripper headspace, and it's more of a straightforward stimulant than even the 5-APB HCl I've had a coupla times recently I think.

That's actually possible; my assumption of this being 6 was entirely based on the mushroom-like thoughtspace (and lack of stim push) that this compound had, which was consistent with previous reports indicating that 6-APB was more psychedelic. Unfortunately I don't think GC/MS can distinguish between 5-APB and 6-APB very easily. Maybe 1H NMR could, but I'd have to find a lab with that. :/

Everyone knocking low doses -- I don't know if it's my batch or me (I'm not a tiny person), but 70mg was perfect for seeing a show in NYC this past weekend. Almost zero nausea, more like an annoying awareness of my stomach. Euphoria, empathy, danced my ass off for a couple of hours! Only downside was I still grounded my jaw like a motherfucker. Man did that hurt! And I was lacking energy the next day but no serious hangover. 


I may consider seeing what 75 or 80mg is like the next time, but this really hit the spot (8

Quick report:

t:0.00 - empty stomach, oral gel-cap of 200mgs - looked & smelled like the usual, different vendor

t:0.20 - surprised to feel nauseous on 6APB - then vomiting.

t:0.20-2.00 -more empathic, no euphoria as expected. Probably depleted serotonin

t:2.00-4.00 - nicely warm, sweating slightly, chewing gum to ease the jaw tension, not terribly energised, but definitely energy.

t:4.00-12.00 - long slow come-down, eyes stay dilated, nothing good about this but slight energy

t:12.00 - takes a total of 3 zopiclone to get me into a poor sleeping state. Tired next day, but don't get the expected shits.


don't know if this is poor quality, but very likely I'm overdoing it. Looking for alternatives while keeping this stash in the freezer.

My experiences with 6APB, please comment and critique im very curious what your opinions are as I believe I have access to a reliable source with top notch 6apb. Ive noticed very little side effects compaired to some people in europe (USA here).


I discovered 6apb about a month ago and it has totally revolutionized my life. I used to love mdma but the magic seems to have been lost and i feel into a deep depression. Since then i am on zoloft and unable to achieve any feeling from mdma. Then i tried 6apb it was very very magical. Ive since turned my friends, family, neighbors, hell even adults onto it lol they fucking love it. We all noticed the same general roll patterns esp when coming up. 6apb takes roughly 1hr, peaks from 2-3hours. Its like this for all of us, and also half of us are on some SSRI, and we still roll (only side effect is less visuals/eye wiggles). I keep reading people that throw up and stuff its very mind boggling my friends and I have had zero complaints about that. Only stomach discomfort came and went for about 10 minutes in.


**Odd things noticed about 6apb, what are anybodies opinions on the following?

**It seems to be body weight sensitive. IE, females can get a great experience off of 100mg to get great visuals, guys are more around 180mg for like a 175-200lb male.


-Stomach discomfort almost seems to be able to be thought away, if you dont think about it or convince yourself your stomach is just fine it gets way better. Also Ginger is a very safe easy way to feel better.

-The insomnia kind of sucks, however I found that listening to youtube sleep hypnosis knocks me out very fast....

-Driving probably shouldnt be reccomended but feels like your driving a space ship lol

-zero depression, regular life just seems very boring in contrast.

-Vicks vapor rub seems to be able to give me almost full body orgasms, my friends and i notice we seem to get lost in it.

-While i very much enjoy it and everything about it, it seems that sometimes on the comedown my brain wants to do everything at once yet nothing at all.

-My brother and i suffer from bad anxiety, we notice with 6apb we have zero anxiety... if a little tinge of it comes you can literally just say to yourself everythigns fine and continue enjoying your night.

-Time goes by super fucking slow. I had a 6apb party lol and from T1.15 - T2.00 seemed like 6 hours for all of us lol. However, I noticed if i am on it for more than 36 hours towards the end time goes by very very fast.

- Nobody can tell when im on it except other people that are rolling can tell by the way i touch things and my eyes darting around. Coworkers ect.

- Dont go to a movie theatre it seems extremely fucking long, i watched a thriller... i kept trying to figure out how the killer in the movies thought process worked with no success lol....


ok.... my experience with combinations and 6apb + ......

kratom/opiates - greatly enhances euphoria, closest feeling to classic mdma roll

dxm (had a legit cold) - enhances the visuals and trippyness of 6apb, feels like floating in a sparkly wonderland

MXE - Holy fuck be careful of your dosages lol, took 35mg orally and went to the bathroom as it kicked in. Was on toilet looking at towel rack, the rack looked like a concert hall and the little tiles on the floor seemed like tiny little rooms. headspace feels incredibly floaty and almost like i am in outerspace. The 6apb makes the visuals and mood feel like your on an alien space ship. While driving depth perception was very very very distorted. DO NOT DRIVE ON THIS COMBO I ALMOST CRASHED LOL

Benzos - can sometimes take away from the roll a little bit, however they do give you an amazingly warm and comfortable experience.

Piracetam/racetams - Enhance the whole general roll alot, it takes like 2/3 6apb dose to feel almost the same

Antihistamines (diphenhydramine/doxylamine) - doesnt really make you drowsy but almost like a happy lazy feeling

Psuedoephedrine - makes your head space feel extremely clean, thinking becomes almost effortless (i suspect this time of year my allergies may be interfering with general consciousness)

MDAI - didnt really do shit, i felt almost tired. pretty sure due to me being on an ssri and molecular weight the methlenedioxy doesnt stand a chance like taking an ssri on mdma

Methylphenadite - makes what little side effects rediculously strong, especially cotton mouth like a beast. I would caution everybody to seriously try to avoid water intoxication.

SNRI (Effexor) - i havent done this, but friends who take it daily I noticed had zero problems sleeping.... noteworthy


Wow, that was alot but I think my experiences are fairly normal... almost all my friends notice pretty much the exact same. Please comment, thanks =) Lastly: Chemistry question to anybody out there knowledgeable on phenethylamines? Does this rationale seem normal.... Soo 6apb is basically MDA where methlenedioxy has been swapped with benzofuran and amphetamine with an amine. Could somebody take mdma and swap the methlenedioxy with a benzofuran????? a chemistry geek friend told me its possible however the intermediate may be very unstable.

That would be 6-MAPB. 5-MAPB is reportedly making the rounds right now.

dirtyfrank Wait a second.. are you saying you discovered 6-APB just a month ago and already tried combining it with 10 different *kinds of drugs*? It shouldn't even work at such frequency of taking..


Also if I can ask, how old are you? Since you say "Ive since turned my friends, family, neighbors, hell even adults" I assume you are not 18 yet (although you also say something about coworkers so I'm a bit lost really), and you already went through depression from mdma abuse? Maybe you should slow down a bit.. 

other than that I'm happy that you enjoy APB, I guess I always had dirtier batch than you guys get now ( I haven't ordered/taken any for 3 months) because for me and all my friends stomach discomfort was always VERY bad and lasted for at least one hour, somebody threw up and somebody had diarrhea on comeup (like me). It was definitely not just in our heads, when you're so sick you can't think about anything else, you're just sick.

Not only is combining 6-APB with some of the other drugs you mentioned incredibly dangerous, driving on 6-APB and MXE is incredibly fucking stupid. You obviously don't care what harm you might cause to yourself based on this post but you could've greatly injured or killed other people while doing that. I urge you to give sobriety a try and take time to reconsider your destructive decisions.

In most of Europe all (M)APBs are still completely legal AFAIK, which is pretty surprising to me. Maybe it's because it's not very addictive - and people don't do crazy things on it, or at least aren't in mass media.

I had a client blame polish lager for his attack on a cop.  His usual British shop was closed.  Some folk are just tits.  I can barely get across a room on 6apb never mind turn into grasshopper!  Over time I've settled at 220mg being optimal.  Excellent roll but deffo no martial arts.

What would a dose of say 50mg ingested be like? And what about 50mg snorted? Has anyone tried these doses?

He's right. No-one can give you a definite answer anyway, due to individual differences is size, psychology, tolerance, etc.


IME, 50 mgs oral would be "stimmy" but not euphoric. My best time was my first time (as usual, with drugs) where my girlfriend & I took 70mgs, then another 70mg 4 hrs later and had very erotic & pleasurable sex-play for about 10 hours.

I can't read through all that shit. I read like 6 pages of this already. These threads are huge. I'd rather just have someone tell me that has taken the substance at those doses before. Or I guess I could always just find out by trying it myself eventually.

if you're not willing to do the research, don't take research chemicals. so easy.


that said. i've read people saying doses below 100 mg are pretty dysphoric.

that's put me off trying this one for now even tho i have some. i don't wan't to jump in at a full dose but i don't want to do a test dose either if its going to mean 6- 8 hours of uncomfortable stimulation.

I'm not really playing with it when I have done enough research to know that a normal dose is 100mg, and some people have gone on 750mg benders. I'm asking and planning on trying 50mg. I'll be fine.

Will look like playing with words worth picking out doses below 100mg might be *not euphoric* but not disphoric. Disphoric means you have really bad mood, when you take too low dose of a drug you will have just normal mood, not bad mood.

Well, you're about half an hour in, so that make sense. IME, first signs on 100mg /empty stomach/ are around that time.

Actually feels excactly similar to an MDMA come-up, slight sweaty hands, tingles, colours are getting brighter. Should I expect euphoria from 100 mg's or is it wise to add a little bit?

It's hard to know - you'll be different to me. But if you don't reach that peak within an hour - or feel it coming but not going higher - I'd add another 20-50mgs on top - but that's just me. Then again, you might just hit that place as is....

no i mean exactly what i said. i read reports of people having an uncomfortable experience at near-threshold doses.

I'm not worried about "wasting" 50 mg and not feeling anything. that is a built in cost for trying a new drug. I was put off by the possibility that the titration up to full dose would involve uncomfortable, "bad mood" experiences. 


maybe you have tried and felt differently? might get me interested in finally using the stuff.

This stuff is way to expensive and seems a lot weaker than cheaper material. I was interested in this, but going to put that interest on the back burner till I can try 5-MAPB or maybe when I can get a good amount of both 6-APB & 5-APB so I can test both alone and together.


But more interested in the 25x's right now.

Ah sorry I was sure you mean not-euphoric.


I have different experience and so do a few of my friends. When I took 50 mg (from a not so strong batch where the really euphoric dose was in region of 150-200mg) I felt nice, a drug-naive person would have no reason to think I was on a drug because I acted very normally, just had much better mood, slightly more energetic and no nausea during comeup. Except the fact that even such low dose did enlarge my pupils, guess most people know why is that.  


Still I have to say I don't really like APB for clubbing (only took it twice there, other experiments were at home), it just makes me energetic AND lazy at the same time, I am wide awake but don't really want to do anything besides listening to music in headphones or talking. 

For clubbing is better MDMA or MMC or 4-FA imo...


As for price, 6-APB isn't the cheapest among RCs but it's not super expensive either when you consider that it lasts long time. This probably varies region to region a bit, where I live 1 night on APB is still much cheaper than on quality MDMA (which is sold in ridiculous prices in crystal form here, 3x more per gram compared to good meth, and most E pellets are fake useless crap filled with coffeine and tiny bit of meth maybe).

Shaggy, I'd change your name to Fishy Fin (Dolly Parton - Theres somethin fishy going on on those fishing trips you keep going on - perfect for those paranoid moments.)  (I'd only been to the shops but said ....thats it no more fishing for me baby, but I digress).  I have friends who are journalists and they all admit journalism as we know it is dead.  Now its all raping chat boards and FOI requests.  Nothing you say makes sense......yesterday you cant wait to try......today you wont bother.  You can't be assed to read the efforts of pioneers who have gone before you to provide all the info that is avialable.   I am sorry to take this position, its not really my style, and I apologise in advance if Ive broken rules, but I really enjoy the open mindedness of BL and your LACK of interest is neither informative nor interesting.  Take 500mg 5mapb and see what happens....I await the trip report with anticipation and a blank FOI request.  Cheers

(I'd only been to the shops but said ....thats it no more fishing for me baby, but I digress).  I have friends who are journalists and they all admit journalism as we know it is dead.  Now its all raping chat boards and FOI requests.  Nothing you say makes sense......yesterday you cant wait to try......today you wont bother.  You can't be assed to read the efforts of pioneers who have gone before you to provide all the info that is avialable.   I am sorry to take this position, its not really my style, and I apologise in advance if Ive broken rules, but I really enjoy the open mindedness of BL and your LACK of interest is neither informative nor interesting.  Take 500mg 5mapb and see what happens....I await the trip report with anticipation and a blank FOI request.  Cheers

How about instead of taking 500mg of a chem that is similar in price to MDMA, I just get a chem that doses under 1mg, and is super cheap. I don't have money to spend right now on taking 5x doses to feel "good". I'd rather take a small dose and feel "AMAZING". 


So maybe I'll get back to Benzo-Fury soon, maybe it will take a while. I didn't say I was no longer interested in it, just that other interests came along that were more interesting.

What's the best way to avoid stomach discomfort on this substance? I tried on a full stomach and had much trouble keeping myself together. Would taking it on an empty stomach take care of this problem?

Take 6-apb on an empty stomach. It will hit you faster and harder & if you have any stomach upset, there will be less/nothing to shit/puke. IME, 6-apb is wasted on a full stomach.

I usually prefer a light meal in my stomach to an empty stomach. With 6-apb, the only difference I've noted is come on time. It'll take 30-60 minutes longer for full effects.

^ I quite enjoy a small bowl of sugary cereal with the dose and didn't really experience noticeable time delay. Also it guarantees some energy if it ends up being a long one

Not frosted/corn flakes though, chundered them up once and i swear my throat was being cut to shreds when they were coming back up.

Good theory. I like it. But, I think its more like drinking a little too much, or like taking that one extra percocet. Sometimes its gotta come back up. The body is very good at expelling stuff it doesn't want in it. 


If nausea/vomiting are an issue, I recommend staggering doses. And maybe eat a sandwich before dosing. That should help you not absorb too much apb at once.

Yes, serotonin releasers are well known for inducing nausea. Specifically 5-HT3 agonists for sure if you want to get all Science! (although I'm sure other factors play a part). It's not just 6-APB that does this, of course.


There are some reports of people using drops of essential lemon oil to reduce psychedelic nausea (eg for DMT, shrooms, etc.). There is some Science! behind this as beta-pinene, a component in this oil, does seem to be a 5-HT3 antagonist ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17511060](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17511060) -- although the study used ginger, the "chat board consensus" is that lemon oil is more effective due to higher concentration of beta-pinene.)


(Alcohol by the way is a 5-HT3 agonist of some sort, that probably partially explains the puking phenom.)

Apparently it's not the B-pinene, see the discussion [here](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/661264-Lemon-Essential-Oil). Ginger is a great antiemetic though.


I would not be surprised if it was a result of direct 5HT-3 agonism but if not I bet it's the serotonin release.

so does anyone have any added insight as  to how 6apb being a potent full agonist for the 5h2b (or 5ht2b ?) might effect the cardiovascular system as oppoosed to mdma which is only a weak partial agonist for it? im weary to dip into this chem because this receptor is usually associated with cardiotoxicity. does anyone notice extra vasoconstriction or chest pains or anything with this in comparison to mdma? what about knowledge of how all this receptor shit works? thanks

Looks like Karma wants me to try this stuff. I wasn't supposed to get any, yet I will accidentally have some within the next week or so... Hopefully it's as good as some people say & not as bad as other people say... What does everyone think about 25I-NBOMe or 25I-NBOH mixed with 6-APB, not all at once though. With the 25I's I'd say 250-500mcg of one of those + 80-150mg 6-APB.

Generally speaking, combining monamines releasers with 25x is regarded as sketchy at best. I wouldn't recommend it. There's a fair bit of info on this elsewhere in PD if you wanna read up on it.

The only difference to the heart I can perceive is that mdma makes me fall in love with people. 6apb does not. Lol! For real though, it feels no more dangerous than mdma ever did. Feels safer to me than a night eating amphetamines. I could be wrong though. I'm not a doctor. And FEEL is hardly an accurate indicator of safe. Remember YMMV!

What do we know about mixing amphetamines and 6-apb? I'm seeing Porter Robinson tomorrow night in Houston, and am taking approx. 125mg of 6-APB. Would it be unsafe to take around 20mg of Vyvanse a couple hours earlier?


Also, has anyone tried any amphetamines with 6-apb? How did it change the experience and mindset?

^ That's my guess. Nausea and diarrhea later on. Possibly some over stimulation. 


I've found with 6apb that once you hit the sweet spot, more just brings forward the unpleasant side effects. Like, nausea and excess stimulation.

Methylone is probably the mildest of them, if that's what you're looking for. 6-apb lasts for ages and will probably space you out well into the next day if you have any decent amount. MDMA is probably most stimulating, and the most likely to cause emotional imbalance.


So yeah, if you want something mild & unstressful choose methylone.

It's people like you and I who put that data onto bluelight David, don't be too shocked!


You're quite right dezz, in terms or transporter binding at least, 6-APB looks to be significantly more dopaminergic.

WOW...


I took about 80mg slowly over 20-ish minutes. And it started to hit about 45 minutes in...


First thing I noticed was my hands wanted to move, so I was moving my fingers. Then shadows started looking strange and slowly the carpet would move if I stared at it. Then my friend dosed. Both of our pupils were HUGE, we were EXTREMELY talkative and I was personally having wavy visuals and felt AMAZING all night. Not like magical ecstasy feelings, or like I had to rub my face on a cat or anything. But I was happy. We have fish and a lizard, so that provoked a lot of cool conversation too.


I took it at about 10-11pm. Didn't get to sleep till about 9am. Felt amazing the whole time except like the last hour. Lost interest in a movie I was watching and really just wanted to sleep.


I will definitely be trying this again, next time I think I will try 2x 70mg doses, 45min-1hr apart. And not in the middle of the night next time.


What do you guys think about tolerance with this stuff? How long in between trials?

Hard to say. My first few awesome trips in August have never been replicated, but since then I have not been using the same vendor (so my batches might not be as good) & have only had a phenethylamine break for a few weeks.... so I'm probably low on serotonin.


I'd suggest waiting as long as you can.

How many people have IV'd this? I know I shouldn't and I know that I shouldn't even more because I have pressed pills however I will be using a .22um micron filter and weighing pill to work out dosage.

Powder could be just as bad, I highly doubt there will be anything passing through a .22um filter other than, other water soluble contaminants/by-products from the synth that a powder would most likely contain too.

I cant find the study atm, I know it's Australian (micron filters are free here) but a .22um filter removes 98% of pills and is small enough to filter *most* bacteria. It's as safe as IV pills gets. I generally use them for street drugs too, I don't trust nobody with what I put in my veins.

Hi, folks. I've read every single item on all 5 parts of the B&D 6-APB thread. I'm glad to offer my own experience report:


When I returned home from work, I was excited to find that the 6-APB had been delivered. I hadn't planned on experimenting with it that day, but since it was there, and I had a couple days to recover, I decided to go ahead with it. I took 500mg of magnesium to help with any jaw clenching I might experience, and took a multivitamin, and some Vitamin D3. The following comes from notes (in a very rushed, shaky handwriting.):


T+0: The 6-APB came in 50mg green and white capsules containing a very light tan grainy powder. I took 3 orally, and I dissolved half of one in water and took rectally.


T+1:00: I experienced a slight trembling in my extremities. I found myself clenching my jaw, but I was able to resist the impulse. I experienced short, mild rushes of heat and head pressure, and enjoyed the mild pleasure of coming up. I felt that this come-up was very similar to the one I feel when I eat shrooms. Saliva kept filling my mouth, and I made frequent trips to the sink to spit. I enjoyed a cigarette, and drank approximately a liter of water. At this stage, I found myself taking care of short, simple chores, like washing the dishes, feeding the dogs, making the bed... I was listening to some music, and decided to draw a bath.


T+1:15: I observed pronounced dilation of my pupils, and my pulse was strong and fast. The warm rushes were more intense, and my feet were hot and sweating, but my hands were cold. Took a bath.


T+1:30: I found myself leaning over the bath to vomit in the toilet. Nothing came up, but it quelled the nausea I began to experience. My body was starting to get very shaky, but it was pleasurable. A thick haziness obscured my vision, like looking through fog. Movement seems effortless, like my body is self-propelled.


T+1:45: I'm definitely experiencing a stimulant effect from this chemical. My body is tingly, especially in my extremities (hands, feet, face.) I finished w/ the bath and decided I was very comfortable naked. At this point I feel like the full effect was coming upon me, and I was losing balance, and felt like I could pass out. I started sweating, but I was still enjoying the experience.


T+2:00: I threw up violently. But boy did I feel better after that. I thought my internal temperature might be running high, but my digital thermometer actually displayed LO, meaning that my core temp was actually below 95 degrees. I wanted to dance, and I did, but I got bored quickly. The time was really flying by. I decided to turn off all the lights, and felt like now was a good time to physically stimulate my body with self-massage and yoga. I was listening to Francisco Tarrega, the classical guitar helped keep my mood inspired, and my attitude mellow. I started to write, in a mad rush, and it was pretty abstract but neat.


T+3:00: I started to feel like I was slowly coming back to myself. (Little did I know that this ride was far from over.) I was definitely rolling, or at least what I think rolling is like, since I've never used ecstasy. But everything was very pleasurable and just nice! Jaw clenching like crazy though. For the next three hours I was playing with myself to no climax, but it felt good anyway. I drank another liter of water.


T+6:00: I'm back to working on projects again. My mind is back. I smoked a bowl of weed, of the “Cheese” strain. I finally jerked off to a massive (biggest ever) ejaculation.


T+7:00: My eyes are dilated as if I'd had dilation drops administered. They are just big black orbs. My body is so stiff and tense. I'm wiped out. I'm straight shot. Hard to urinate. I must have stood in front of the toilet for fifteen minutes trying to relax so I can pee. It inhibits the bowels and urination.


T+7:30: I smoked a cigarette. It was nice. I smoked another bowl of weed. I'm starting to relax.


T+8:00: I decided to eat some dinner... Ate a big plate of leftovers, and drank some more water. I decided to lay down and watch a movie. It felt good to lay down, but I could tell I was still experiencing the stimulant effects of this chemical. I chugged two high-proof beers to help bring me down a bit.


T+10:00 I finally got to sleep.


T+14:00 I'm wide awake with only four hours of sleep. I'm in a good place. I'm still feeling sharp, like the stimulant is still effective. My eyes are no longer dilated. I could go to work now, if I wanted to. I'm drinking coffee, though, because my body craves it.


Overall Thoughts: This is something that ought not be done more than once a month. It's very potent, much moreso than I expected. I would probably do it again, but like all drugs, I will be sure to be careful. The dosage seemed perfect for me. It was about 175mg altogether, and I weigh 175 lbs, and am 35 years old.

Thanks, Morkin & Redbong.


I don't know which of the two I have. As I reported, it arrived in green and white capsules of 50mg each. The powder inside is a very light tan, but almost white. I will see if I can post an image here.


And yes, gastrointestinal distress indeed. But then, I'd been experiencing a bit of constipation all that week.

I want to add some info for this thread.


I have a friend that was a "candy kid" when he was younger, and recently went home to visit his home town and friends. While he was there he tried some Molly for the first time (but he had rolled A LOT before), and some Acid (he had done that before). He said it was great. Then he got back here and tried some 6-APB and said it was BETTER than the molly he tried in his home town.

He probably didn't get real molly then


I just talked to friend today that tried real MDMA for the first time last night, after doing 6-apb twice with me. I asked for similarities, and he said it was like how cats are similar to dogs, but it was the best drug experience he's ever had. And he's done a good 15 different chemicals.

Yeah I have lost the magic hardcore with MDMA, not so with 6-APB. Feelsgooman, decided to eat my 250mg rather than shoot it in smaller amounts, good decision.

I know I had the wisdom to SAY that this is not something that should be used more than once a month, but I didn't have the DISCIPLINE to follow my own wisdom. I used 50mg a day for two days in a row -- both time I had nice peaks and smooth transitions. Then today, I used the 150mg. I'm glad I've exhausted my supply, because I don't want to end up with serotonin syndrome or something like that -- but MAN is this stuff intense. Always remembering to stay hydrated (this time enhanced with balanced electrolytes), I've been listening to music, cleaning the house, writing... Respect this one. It's worth having around, but contrary to a lot of what you read around here and elsewhere, this stuff is definitely neurotoxic. Hallucinations are still very mild for me. I haven't come close to the trippiness a lot of other people feel. Honestly, this stuff reminds me of methamphetamine without the tweak more than MDA. It does enhance tactile sensitivity, though, in a tremendous way. What I would use it for: Pleasure, Sex, Meditation, Exercise. This is not nootropic, in fact, the mind loses all focus and attends to matters passively, as if through a wakened subconscious. It is psychedelic in this manner. I think that's part of why music is so enjoyable and wonderful. (I'm listening to Zep's The Battle of Evermore right now. Perfect.)


But the plateau after the peak is one of stiffness and muscular tension, especially in my back. No cardio or respiratory problems have been noted whatsoever, and that's saying something, since I typically have anxiety problems, and knowing my autonomic functions got it all under control has made this experience repeatedly enjoyable. I think my blood pressure actually dropped. But then that could be the skunk I just enjoyed. Dang. Stairway to Heaven. Good stuff.


I am an experienced user of psychedelics and stimulants, so I have the knowledge to properly relate what this chemical does against others. Also, I'm not a novice to checmically-induced euphoria or hallucinations, so where I may note mild effects, others may experience more intensely, without past experience to compare it to, and think this is THE way to feel euphoria, stimulation, psychedelia--it is still not as potent as other scheduled chemicals like LSD, Methamphetamine, or even good skunk. I can't comment regarding 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), since I've never used it before.


Wow. Stairway to Heaven is ending now. So, that paragraph took what, eight minutes to produce? lol Bruxilism like a mofo. Damn. And my body aches now. I'll be fine, but I'm going to be feeling this tomorrow. Shit... I have to work tomorrow, in less than 12 hours! Well, the skunk put me down last time, I'm sure it will do it again.


Share your experiences with it with me. I want to know if this is typical of what you folks have been experiencing. And I know we don't talk vendors here on the page, but it sure would be interesting to know what vendor provided the stuff that made you feel that way. Maybe you can private message me. If you do, I'll tell you where I got mine.

The effect of this drug on me is NOT typical of those here or around me, I seem to find it much better than others do. In fact it is by far my favourite substance, and I am used to top notch MDMA crystal. The main reason for this is duration. For me MDMA is a 6 hour experience tops, and that is only achieved with a 40% redose at the 2 hour mark. 6-apb gives me 6 straight hours without any desire to redose. Then a 50% redose seems to give another 6 hours. I used to do a full redose at the 6 hour mark, but now feel that this is too much, not that it didnt feel nice.


So dosing out the way, on to the effects. The comeup starts with an inner warmth/glow that quickly escalates to waves of euphoria. This energizes the body and can make hands a bit cold and can also cause mild waves of nausea. I get up and dance around a bit telling myself its fake nausea and it passes easily. The rushes keep coming and sexual activity can be intensely enjoyable providing there is no hurry for results. Just about anything is enjoyable at this point including sitting back and chatting with friends. 


Towards the end of the first dose I find the visuals start to build. As the waves of euphoria start to decay the redose is administered and very quickly the rushes return. Energy is fully topped up and it is almost as if the real experience is about to begin. The visuals really start to build due to the redose, with fast moving patterns exploding into life on plain textured surfaces. The boundaries of most objects starts to break up. The edges of many things seem hairy at a distance but upon closer inspection the hairs become dissolving energy fields, with complex 3d visual artifacts growing within them. Smaller objects start to dissolve completely into fast moving transparent patterns of light.


After around 12 hours the comedown begins and is quite gradual. But the visuals keep on building. They are not like typical tryptamine/phenethylamine visuals at all. They are not at all intrusive as they can be ignored or intensified at will. Staring at a wall, willing myself to trip can yield some of the most impressive visuals I have ever seen. And then in a blink of an eye I can return to normality and go make a cup of tea. The edges of the cup start dissolving into patterns of light though.


Eventually I get tired and fall asleep easily. Upon awakening the visuals are sadly completely gone, and its a good day to smoke weed and reflect on the experience and try to bring some of the positive energy from the trip to bear in real life. Providing I take it easy physically I notice no negative comedown effect. This is most unusual, most people report quite rough comedowns with this stuff. 


In summary its a bit like MDMA, only less of the empathy push, much better visuals, much more energy, and everything for 3x as long.

did anyone hear about any US bans on 6apb? seems to me that would be the only reason there are no longer any vendors willing to ship to the us. maybe it got too popular?

Florida has banned the APBs. I don't think any other state has though.

ah that might be why then. just a few months ago there were many US sources and now there are zero. seems to be popular in the uk though. i better hold on to what ive got then since i probably wont ever be able to get more in the us!

Well not, it's certainly not as *potent*, but it is very close to matching their intensities in the respective dose range.

Waaay too often currently.


I must have gotten through a session every week for 6 weeks and then a further 4 times every 10 days. Was going to stretch to once every two weeks but think it would be more prudent to have a complete break for a while.

I still roll hard every time. The experience may be slightly diminished from the first times, but not enough for me to have noticed.


I started and have stuck with 150mg every time. But I usually redose at least once. So at least 300mg a night.

That's all I was getting at. But 6-APB is a very potent, and very enjoyable. Each use seems better than the last.


I haven't tried redosing after a high dose, as Tryptamine Bunny mentioned, but may try that when I replenish my supply sometime next month.

I've only redosed once after a higher dose.  That was bit experimental as had additional free time. Took approx 100 mg 4 hours after initial 220 mg.  was quite quickly having exorcist chuck ups.  Can't recall any extra pleasures and felt xtra fatigued next day.   Have also tried equal doses hour or so apart but best results continue to be about 220 mg bombed with some drink. Volvic flavoured water seems to remove most of the taste nastiness.  If you don't get that powder down sharpish you will be retching.

Tryptamine Bunny - I envy your experience! Perhaps I just need to push the dose higher. Also, I probably need to give myself a month to built up some serotonin...

i always redose 6apb, it doesnt really get you  any more higher, it just prolongs the experience and also makes the visuals and the trip go crazy once you get past the 300mg mark. but then obviously you will have a harsher comedown

Yup that's what I found. Although I tend to combine all the all available apb /mapb. Above 300mg spread out over a night is crazy indeed. Not recommended if you like being ontop of things.

That's what I was thinking. 250 mg all at once would have me hurling guts while rubbing on myself. Boring would probably be the last word I would use to describe it. I would probably say intense or scary. Goes to show ymmv! Your product may vary too!

Even on the weakest I've had, 250mg would have me stuck to the ceiling ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I have no magic to MDMA and extremely high tolerance even years after dosing. My IV methylone dose is 300mg, Oral, atleast 500mg to have a decent time. I wouldn't consider taking MDMA below 200mgs otherwise it is just dysphoric as hell. I had consumed methylone roughly 2 weeks before hand and went through 2.5g of methylone another 2 weeks before that  so yeah, my minor (lol) tolerance might have come into play.


Don't try these doses at home kids, getting to this stage took over 3-4 years of abusing MDMA and has left me with pretty severe depression and anxiety issues. I am just getting over my depression now over 2.5 years after stopping abusing MDxx ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)


My good mate who still takes MDMA/pills/meth every weekend and takes around ~200-300mg MDMA to start off his nights took the same as me but took it in two doses of 125mg about 2 hours about had pretty much the same effects as you guys so don't worry I am just a (fried) freak of nature.

My tolerance has stayed for quite awhile, with 150 mg being slightly underwhelming after about 4 months break. I've done it around 10 times now in the past 2 years, with no mdxx tolerance at all before as 6-apb was the first time i rolled, and i only did it every 4-12 weeks tops during that span.  My last session was 200 mg dose to start, followed by 50-100 mg every 3 or 4 hours up until the 18 hour mark when i finally stopped.  I ended up doing about 550 mg total, and honestly i can tell that this chem can be a little toxic if you're not careful, but i havent had any comedowns yet besides a little drowsiness and cramps the next day but not bad.  Overall a lovely chem but i really dont want to do this more than a couple times a year tops from here on out i think the more people push it the riskier it gets...

Well folks, I reupped on Friday. Saturday afternoon I ingested 200mg. It was a little edgier an came with a lot more side effects than the 150 - 175 mg I had been taking. But with the help of some powerful marijuana I was asleep about ten hours later.


Today, the day afterward, I took 150mg, and it has been one of the most euphoric instances yet. I almost thought I was going to black out at one point, when those rushes were seizing me.


Great feeling, though. Now I'm just chilling reading bluelight articles and watching Scooby Doo cartoons.

Correct, Morkin. Saturday, I swallowed for 50 mg capsules. I must be getting used to the upset stomach, because even though I did retch, nothing came up. I find that regularly sipping from a glass of water keeps any nausea at bay.


No hangover, but yesterday, after work, I had some trouble keeping my eyes open.Slept like a baby.


I've been supplementing with a ton of vitamins, minerals, and fatty acids. I'll post the data tonight, in a few hours.

would taking a small amount of 6-APB for example 40mg 6-APB in combination with 5-APB 100mg be of any use? Would the 40mg 6apb extend the duration of the experience or is 40mg 6apb way too low even though it would be combined with 100mg 5apb?


What is 5-APB's duration of effect. Not the whole experience where your left wide awake stimulated, the actual high

When I took 50 mg (from a not so strong batch where the really euphoric dose was in region of 150-200mg) I felt nice, a drug-naive person would have no reason to think I was on a drug because I acted very normally, just had much better mood, slightly more energetic and no nausea during comeup. Except the fact that even such low dose did enlarge my pupils, guess most people know why is that.

cool. i was wondering, how long did you leave between redoses? I was expecting acute tolerance to this drug ala mdma or psychedelics.


I have a week break coming up (last real break for a while). Hoping to finally try this stuff out.

any short-term recommendations on a good mixing ratio of 6-apb and 5-apb(HCl)? chilling at home, close friends-setting... ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Yes, in my experience the HCL is about twice as strong. Of course, my only measure is subjective.


Let us know how your combos work out.

Or multiples thereof. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) Ratio there is a good one. And no, probably not worth buggering about too much adjusting for 5-APB Succ vs HCl, it's all gravy I'm sure.

Never had the succinate so can't compare but no, nothing like double I don't think. HCl < 20% stronger going by all I've read. Weight for weight with 6-APB the 5 HCl hits a lot harder, a lot faster, espesh insufflated. Feels a lot stronger on the come up but not sure peak is very much different in intensity. Make of that what you will, it's maybe not an accurate comparison I'm making.

Here's an experience report from Thursday,


CHEMICAL	6-APB


QUANTITY:	150MG


ROUTE OF ADMINISTRATION:	ORAL, SWALLOWED, CAPSULES


TIME OF ADMINISTRATION:	2013.02.21 1820 HOURS


1900 hours	Drinking lots of water, doing chores. Laundry, cleaning house.


1920 hours	Already feeling come up. A little uncomfortable. I feel that this one is going to be a zippy! Had good 10 hours plus sleep before hand. Lots of antioxidants and other nutritious agents in body.


1930 hours	The impulse to throw up is already intense.


1935 hours	Take a shower!


1945 hours	Drying off, sense of touch strong, a little unbalanced... drinking water helps. Starting to get out of body ish.


1950 hours	Trembling in extremities. Fingertips hot.


1955 hours	Weighed myself: 167.5 lbs.


1955 hours	For some reason there is no eye dilation yet!


1955 hours	Internal temperature, at ear, as measured by optical thermometer: Too low to register


2005 hours	Internal temperature, under tongue (since ear won't measure, for some reason): 97.9 degrees F


2005 hours	Heart rate is: 72bpm


2030 hours	Been getting all the feelings typical, and pretty powerfully, too. Finally get eye dilation, but it comes and goes.


2044 hours	Listening to music, getting a lot of different projects done (simultaneously) – note: I can't believe only fifteen minutes has past. Wow!


2051 hours	Still getting waves, and a good thing, too, because I was worried I wasn't going to get any euphoria, and just stim!


2138 hours	Finished some projects. Heart rate is up. I want to exercise! Eyes fully dilated. Turned off most of the lights in the house.


2200 – 0200 hours	I stopped recording during the experiment, future notes are being typed the day after. During this period I was definitely in and out of focused consciousness. Approximately four hours after ingesting the 6-APB, I find myself in a state where it becomes easy for me to project myself into imaginary circumstances. For example, I can “trick” my brain into seeing what I want it to see, feel what I want to feel, etc. It's quite extra-sensory in this way. Past experiments with dosages larger than 150mg and I'm usually too overwhelmed to control where I want to go with the “trip” and it usually leads to sex (when available) or masturbation. At 150mg, I control the trip somewhat, and music is like a soundtrack to my “movie.”


NOTE: Tuesday night I experimented by plugging 100mg 6-APB and it affected me less powerfully. I had read reports that less would go farther through this route of administration. It didn't that time, anyway. My pupils never really got too dilated, and instead of the pleasurable warm hazy waves swallowing 6-APB produces for me, plugging produced creepy, tweaky, prickly cool waves that made me tense and wanting to accomplish tasks but without the ability to pick a task to do! That one I could have done without.

we were two seasoned psychonauts (X&F) experienced with (higher dose) 6-apb and one guy (M) generally less experienced and no XP with 6-apb. I chose the dose to be 110mg 6-apb and 38mg 5-apb and 100mg 6/30mg 5 for M. preload with 1,6g piracetam each. settingwise we wanted to talk and chill at home with blankets, candles, incense, music, "milkdrop" on a video projector... more therapeutic than recreational.

onset was at ~45, comeup @60. comeup was relatively slow (compared to 6-apb alone) and X&F clearly felt the effect of the 5-apb from the beginning. it feels emotionally clear and has a distinct positive push. effects developed over ~30min and I soon felt that the dose was more on the low side for me&us. not underwhelming but for a home setting it could have been a bit higher. no overwhelming rushes, but a nice and stable "useful" plateau.

nevertheless we were all very content with our state and at least for me it felt very healing. emotional/physical and verbal communication was greatly enhanced, so was music and lights.

a big downside of the experience was the duration: against all my expectations and experiences with 6-apb (6-7h peak), I watched the clock at t+3:41 after ingestion - wondering if the effects might be subsiding already. they did.. ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png) substantial and enjoyable effects lasted way longer but the actual peak lasted 2,5h maybe. we soon got a little bit bored and started to smoke weed which dulled the emotional clarity and usefulness of the state but made it much more hedonistic imo.

at this point someone mentioned DMT and got the answer "maybe later". I didn't touch DMT for nearly 2 years but I somehow immediately knew that I would be smoking it later. fast forward 2 hours and many joints - lush roman-emperor-decadence-vibe - M inhales his first 20mg of DMT ever and has a strong experience with an elf-like-entity inviting him over (after I took my dose I gave him 30mg and he came back talking about him having been "at the source". ![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif) ) I also chose 20mg and am very, very pleased with that dose. I feel very free and clear in the DMT space and also comment on a few visions to my friends in real time ("this is so beatutiful", "how could I forget THAT" ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png) )...

X discovered and worked on some deep emotional issues and resistances during the experience (and also during prior ones), issues that he doesn't feel he can resolve at this time. I felt that the (spiritual) power, beauty and benignity of DMT can only be good for him. it wasn't. not really. he said he felt like a puppet being pushed around and from his accounts it sounded like he couldn't manage to go with the flow of the DMT - as if his resistances were even strengthened by the DMT... 


X&F concluded that the amount of 5-apb was just right but 20-30mg more 6-apb would be perfect probably. we felt that 6-apb is the stronger/"better" drug - but that might be flawed by our prior experiences with 6. M would take more too.

no comedown-issues whatsoever can be reported. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Am going to try an experiment tonight. Plan to drop 150mg of 6-apb, waiting for the unique come-up to complete and when urge to redose arrives, then small lines of 5-apb will be insufflated. I intend to limit my research to the synergies between just these two, but anything can happen in the moment ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Thanks for the report Johannes! Really good read. I've been contemplating smoking DMT during the 6-apb comedown, but DMT still scares the crap out of me. I've had 4 experiences with it in 2 years, and haven't touched my stash in a year. Not that I had a bad experience with DMT, its just a lot to take in. And I always get the "I've really done it this time" thought with the super fast come up. I think it could be the perfect ending to the 6-apb experience. I'll wait until its warmer outside, and contemplate it again.

CHEMICAL	6-APB

QUANTITY:	150MG

ROUTE OF ADMINISTRATION:	ORAL, SWALLOWED, CAPSULES

TIME OF ADMINISTRATION:	2013.02.24 1145 hours

1230 hours	Now that I'm more experienced, I am easily aware of the tell-tale signs of coming up. The first wee twinge of nausea can be felt. The senses are starting to be affected, so very mildly at this point, and I can feel extra warmth in my head, especially behind my eyes.

1300 hours	The concentration of my vision, mixed with the slight churning of my stomach means we're happily on our way to the peak, which is still two or so hours away. Now is when I make the most mistakes typing, because my fingers want to move so quickly. Music becomes more ethereal. Everything does, actually. This is the first time I've done this in the middle of the day, so it's very nice to have pure, bright sunshine pouring throughout the house. It's a beautiful warm day.

1312 hours	Just need to note that this is when the waves are starting in any appreciable effect, and the part where I sometimes feel like I could lay down and kinda-sorta pass out.

1315 hours	So I decided to lie down, to get the full effect. This is the most I've experienced the visual effects of the chemical since I started experimenting with it a month ago. Wow! I have red bands and green spots in my peripheral vision.

1345 hours	Just to give an idea of how stimmy this becomes: I just gave all three of my dogs a very thorough bath, washed the bathroom (and tub), and vacuumed the floors in the house. The visuals are still pretty obvious. This is one of the best trips yet!

1422 hours	Wow, I don't know what is different about this time around, but I'm getting a lot more done than I usually am able to on this chemical. I would have thought at LEAST an hour and half passed since I typed my last note. Drinking lots of water. I took a shower at around 1400 hours, and it rejuvenated me.

1526 hours	For the entire last hour, I've been listening to binaural beats, brainwave generators, putting me into creative states of meditation and self-hypnosis. What a great idea! This has been intense. 

1730	Broke out the photo albums, and was transported into the past. I totally spaced the world out and was exploring the stories of those photo albums. But, with the stiffness in my spine and joints, I realize that the peak has passed, and now it's time to condition for the crash. My favorite way is a gentle toothbrushing w/ a mentholated rinse, some hot tea—a sandwich—and as soon as there aren't any more tasks I want to get done today, then the ultimate in crash-prep: smoking a bowl! I expect this is pretty much the end of this experience. All in all, it was one of the best. Powerful and yet comfortable in every way. I accelerated through the atmosphere and orbited the planet a few times, and now I'm coming down, so far so good. See you all back at ground control. Took 9mg of melatonin, a glass of water, and ate a chicken sandwich. (That wasn't TOO hard.)


Based on the last few experience reports, with 150mg of swallowed 6-APB, I come up around 1 hour, peak between 2.5 - 3.5 hours in, and start coming down at around 6 hours. Note, that unless you can fall asleep, the come down will last another six hours easy.


Edit:


1922 hours	About half an hour ago I smoked a big bowl. This come-down might as well be the plateau for other stimulants/psychedelics. I'm still greatly under the influence, although mostly my muscles are tense, I find it hard to relax my body, sit comfortably... Muscles are just primed, tense, ready to go, but they won't  relax.


Other Thoughts:	So far, in February, (this month) I have taken various amounts of 6-APB from 50mg to 225mg on seven different occasions. I have not noticed any tolerance buildup. If anything, re-administering every few days, even day after day (as I have done on one occasion), tends to make each new experience a bit stronger than the last. (Except when I plugged 100mg. That was unexpectedly mild, and I almost would rather be sober.) I insufflated 50mg with 100mg swallowed during one of my experiments, and I remember that being a good trip, but still not as enjoyable as 150mg taken orally.  Swallowing the powder in capsules is my preferred ROA.


Term effects since I've been using this RC? General tiredness caused by not enough sleep; mornings-after tend to be a bit less-than-real feeling, like I'm not wholly there, like part of my mind is in another room, and not paying attention, so you have to consciously bring it over from its room, where it's been reading a book, writing poetry or something.


Good mixes? I've only really mixed vitamins/minerals and shit like that. I have a very strong feeling that the DHA I supplement with is just good to have, like it keeps all the windows clean and shiny, or opens the blinds, or blows the clouds away, or blinks away the dust. I generally feel good like that about fifteen minutes after taking it. 


Okay, don't know if this is something in my diet or what, but last couple of days I have noticed a distinctive smell from my urine that reminds me of methylmercaptan (or the gas that gives “Asparagus Pee” its smell.) And, I haven't eaten asparagus. This is supposed to be my last experiment for a couple of weeks, anyway, so I'll find out what comes of the weird smell—if it persists or goes away. 


As far as neurotoxicity, I have not experienced any of the zaps being described by others, although I am familiar with the neurotoxic effects of other drugs, like methamphetamine, where I would sometimes wake from a deep sleep disconnected from my body, feeling as though I wasn't breathing, or my heart beating. It was like being in a nightmare when you die, but you don't get that “out” of waking up and realizing it's just a dream. People might have been walking around me, I could sense their presences, and yet I couldn't even scream or get their attention, even though everything in my mind was screaming for help! But nothing of the sort with 6-APB. If anything, it's like accelerating in a rocket through the atmosphere, orbiting the planet for a few hours, and then dropping back into the atmosphere and parachuting gently to Earth.


If anything, I have really learned how to manage the new physics of this altered-reality. Whereas it used to take me up to twenty minutes to relax the muscle that lets me urinate, now I am able to relax that muscle at will. I am even able to focus on close objects when my vision starts getting wacky after peak and into the landing (as it does every time). It has also become easier for me to resist the impulse to clench my teeth or bite my cheeks.


The best thing I have done while experimenting with 6-APB was listening to programmable binaural beats with a pair of headphones. I had the most success with my brainwave generator software tonight than I ever have before. I enjoyed several programs, but really enjoyed 7hz. In fact, as soon as The Who is finished playing, I'll probably listen to the binaural beats again. The best way for me to describe the psychoactive effects of 6-APB is to use Freud's structural model of the psyche, and to say that the “Ego” is largely suppressed, and the “Id” is getting pinged the fuck out. Meanwhile, someone's paid off the “Super Ego” which is engaging in some serious reality-stretching, and the “Id” is in charge and intently playing a wild game of make-believe. Spending a few hours moving from an Alpha state to a Theta state and back again really put the reigns in my hands.


The pleasures of the plateau period of 6-APB persist through the “landing.” Stimulation remains strong. I notice that while I miss the euphoria from the peak, I am yet content with what remains. What happens during the comedown is that the “Ego” suppression slowly loses effect, and the ability to accept the fantasy disappears. I find that it's just as exciting, though, returning to reality, because these are the physics of the rigid world, and for a time, they did not constrain me. It is now 2027 hours, almost nine hours since I swallowed the three 50mg capsules. I enjoy typing this experience report. It is actually a good time to reflect on it all, since I'm both in and out of the effects.


Even after day-to-day use, returning to social life isn't difficult. What remains from the trip are bags under the eyes, (easily explained away as lack of sleep) and a stronger sense of individuality. I tend to notice more self-esteem, and feel good about myself, and have more confidence in my ability to influence the world around me. But, I have noticed decreased patience. And what inhibits me from telling people what I think disappears for a while, too, so I become more reactive. There's still a part of my mind that isn't paying attention until I consciously send a messenger up there and ring the bell, but as my physiology returns to normal, not too much has changed. Am I addicted to this chemical? Not that I know of, as I have never experienced anything like a withdrawal symptom, but I'll let you know the next couple of weeks.


edit:


If the so called brain zap feels like an acute headache twinge, then I experienced a couple of those last night, after taking 1000mg of vitamin c.

Hi just a guy, we usually reserve trip reports for the "trip reports" forum. If you want to think of a title I will move it over there for you and you can link and summarise it here.

For my recent research I decided not to try and make a mix of 5-apb and 6-apb. I should really have tested the 5-apb on its own, but couldnt resist popping 150mg of the 6-apb dow the hatch to kick things off. I like everything about 6-apb including the come-up so didn't mix with anything except some weed while it could still have full effect.

This is exactly how I compare 5-APB to 6-APB, TryptamineBuddy. 6-APB is already slightly shirt on the adrenaline side, but 5-APB is just too sedating. Reminds me of MDAI, but stronger, clearly.

I think you have done more research on this aspect. I seem to have focussed on the hedonistic, ego massaging, euphoric bliss aspects.

Thanks, not a detailed report really, more of a summary of 5-apb and 6-apb interaction. And n2o. And a few things best not reported ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I'd be very cautious if I were you, both of these put a lot of tension on the cardiovascular system, bound to be a troublesome combo.

I think the raised heart rate would be the problem. Vasoconstriction and a fast pulse will lead to your blood pressure skyrocketing.

Earlier, I wrote about how I wonder if there are any side effects from using 6-APB, and I think I was starting to get close to that whole "locked-in-syndrome" feeling. Can any organic chemists among us tell me if 6-APB stops acetylcholine from depolarizing the postsynaptic membrane? Why would it? Because after many uses in a short span of time I remember feeling the suggestion of paralysis... Anyway, the research material is gone and unavailable for the indefinite future, so I'd love to continue to learn through bluelight.

I allowed a week to pass since the last time I had used, and then I used 150mg each afternoon for three nights in a row. Each day I smoked quite a bit of cannabis to force sleep, so I could get 5 - 7 hours of sleep each night. It was the last experiment that left me feeling that disconnect. This may be considered by some to be overuse. I'm learning as I go. I consider 150mg to be an optimal dosage for a person of my weight, 185 lbs.

6-APB most probably has no effect on ACh receptors, no molecules of any similar sort of shape have any anticholinergic action. Probably just serotonin induced laziness. But then again, who knows what was actually in what you took.

What happens when you suppress reuptake of Serotonin, Norepinephrine, AND dopamine in huge amounts and increase transportation of them as well? Like ethylphenidate mixed with 6-APB?

Inhibiting reuptake generally prevents the releaser getting into the neuron so the effects of the releaser will be blocked.

Yes it is. Look at how SSRIs block the effects of MDMA for example. The transporter is also required to work in reverse to flood flood the synapse so it's two fold.

Not going to go into detailed events now and I know this wasn't the brightest move (understatement I know) but I will say that high dosages of this stuff can be very detrimental to your psychological state. I had began to raise my dose to approx 600-800mg every 3-4 weekends (up to 1 gr one weekend) and after the 5th time I had a psychotic break. I began to experience delusions, delusions of reference, paranoia, depersonalization, HPPD, massive depression, and panic attacks. Lasted a year but gradually returned to my normal state with the help of medication.


Please stay safe and watch doseages.

Wow!  That's  pretty rough! I haven't used more than 250 mg before  and that's pretty potent.  I can only imagine what it was like with 800mg... I bet when the  fog  set in it was thick!

Hi everyone,


Was looking for some advice with regard to APB. 


Generally, I'm an anti-drugs person, I have plenty of friends who have done or do drugs but it's never been my type of scene. Around a month ago, it was my first time with Benzo Fury. It was more of an in the moment thing, I wasn't planning to do it that night but sort of just happened. It was my first time on drugs. I loved it. I didn't take that much at all but it was amazing. 


Ever since then, I don't think I've been the same. I've had this sort of numbness in my head ever since, the first two weeks or so, it was quite bad but it's sort of got better as time as gone by. However, it still remains today. It's something weird to explain, it's like a numbness/tingling sensation in my brain/head. I've noticed this sensation has changed places as well at times. I did drink while on it but I didn't drink too much. I also took a week off of going out i.e. drinking after I had done it. This tingling sensation is just there, it's weird, I still just get on with life, it doesn't really effect me, I can do my work for university, still go out etc. It hasn't really effected my ability to do things, I still feel the same. The first two weeks I was tired/dazed, my friend even commented on it but I thought that was just normal. I feel fine now, it's just weird that it's still there as I thought it would go. One thing I have noticed, is that it's worse when I'm tired or after I've been drinking. Before Friday, I hadn't gone out in a good 12 days or so (I think) and I noticed it was getting better, although that could of been to do with the the fact that I was really busy. It's a weird sensation to explain, it's a bit like when say you've been studying all day and it's come to that point when your brain just needs a rest and feels fried. 


It has worried me over the last month or so. And I do believe it's time to see a doctor, something which I should have done earlier I know. The problem is, seeing a doctor requires telling my parents that I've done drugs. Something I can feel I can do, I've already told them about the numbness but the not the drug side. I'm currently at uni, so I live away from home. The holidays are coming up in a week or so, so I'll probably see a doctor then when I'm back at home. It's just going to be an awkward conversation.


Was just wondering if anyone else had experienced this numbness before? Or does anyone have any advice for my situation?


It was my first time on drugs properly, it was a great experience but because of the after effects, I don't think I'll be going anywhere near drugs in the future. 


Thanks.

thing is Ed, funnily enough Drs often have a piss poor understanding and narrow minded outlook on these things. I suspect you will get more knowledge about research chems on here than in your Drs office; just soemthing to consider before getting a written, permanent record on your file at the GPs


about your question;


the 'benzo fury' pellets gave me 'brain zaps' for several days...hard to explain what they're like, like a startling pulse of electricity going through my head, often as i was drifting off to sleep.


i believe they are a consequence of playing with your seratonin levels and not an indicator of any damge done...


as to you experiencing 2 / 3 week symptoms, now i'm not a Dr but thats a lot longer than i've ever heard of.

It could mean 

A - these drugs are just not for you, the symptoms have extended as its the first time you've played with that part of the brain and its just wondering what on earth happened

B - its a coincidence and your symptoms are viral and have nothing to do with the 6APB

C - its psychosamatic and / or you're brain is creating this feeling because you are focusing on / worrying too much about it

that may sound like im patronizing you but i'm really not, 6APB is a mild psychedelic but any psychedelic can play games with you if you let it, most people who experiment with these things eventually have an experience that lingers with them for a while


now i imagine somebody will come along and tell you to get to the DRs sharpish, and maybe that would be the better thing to do, i'm just telling you what i would do, which in a nutshell is wait it out....

if you really want to see the DR think long and hard before mentioning drugs to your GP, they really can be utter twats, the idea that once you've tried one drug you are on your way to being a crack whore or jumping out of a window is more common that you'd think

Thank you for your reply.


I believe it's the seratonin levels but of course I'm not sure.


That's a good point about the worrying thing. My first time was more and in the moment thing, it wasn't planned. I didn't really realize what I had done until I took it. It then hit home and I realised fuck, I've just done drugs. I was quite worried after I had taken it and while I was waiting for it too hit me, once it hit me, I was more or less fine, while I was on it there was bit more worrying but that was mainly because I was nearly sick, after doing a shot, I kept the vodka (or whatever it was) in my mouth for too long. That gave me a gagging feeling but I was fine after that, just couldn't keep still and wanted to dance all the time. I loved the experience, apart from the worrying beforehand. 


My friend said I looked worried beforehand. I'm quite a worrier in general to be fair but that has started to go as I've gotten older, I'm 20 now. The period where my head started to feel better i.e. the period I mentioned above, was when I was most busy and hadn't been drinking. I don't really worry about it constantly but it's definitely on my mind. Maybe should have mentioned this in my original post. I think my worries have gotten worse because the tingling etc hasn't gone away. I did some research online and people have said that it should goes after 2 weeks but I guess everyone is different. 


I think it's probably best to see the doctor anyhow, my problem might be not linked with Benzo at all.

first: there is no such thing as "drugs". there are psychoactive substances with a wide array of pharmacological and psychological effects. please don't talk about "drugs" and stop thinking in terms of "drugs" and "drug scene". what especially annoys me is the notion of "drugs" vs. "alcohol"...many people do it and it's not only scientifically wrong but misleading and dangerous.

if you chose to consume potent psychoactive substances (like 6-apb) it is wise to do sufficient research about the nature of the compound; dose, potential effects, duration, after effects and so on. are you sure you consumed 6-apb? do you know the dose?

end of rant. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


more on topic: your problem sounds psychosomatic. this does not mean that it is no real or that you are crazy...it means that it is probably not created by physical but by psychological mechanisms (very real ones that is). 6-apb (given you indeed consumed 6-apb) is a substance with quite remarkable potentials to change the way you think, feel and experience reality - also in the long run and permanently. this is a feature it shares with other powerful psychoactives such as MDMA, LSD, psilocybin and so on (empathogens, psychedelics or more generally: entheogens). those substances are no toys and should rather be treated as tools for self-exploration and growth. disregarding or underestimating the potential (transformative) power of those substances may lead to dark places. one possible way in the direction of a dark place might be: "taking drugs is against my views. nevertheless I did take drugs without thinking. I even enjoyed it a lot - hell I even had realizations I never thought of, never could have thought of if I hadn't touched drugs. I feel good, no I feel guilty. I don't know." boy, I can't look into your mind but I could see thoughts like that arising and I can very clearly see how thoughts like that can lead to symptoms you describe.

I don't suggest that you disrespected a sacrament and are therefor punished ( ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png) ) but you should be aware of those potential effects and also that it is often vital for a person's psychological and physical wellbeing to debrief and integrate experiences provoked by powerful psychoactive substances. serious psychedelics [on bluelight I'm probably in the minority with this view but I definitely count 6-apb as a serious psychedelic] demand commitment and are often as much 'work' as they are 'play'.

some of those ideas probably sound unfamiliar or even weird to you. I don't know if it helps or furthers deepens you insecurities if I tell you that pretty much everything you hear about "drugs" in mass media or from governmental agencies is simply wrong or misleading - I still tell you cause I think the dissonance between personal experience and (seemingly) consensual knowledge can make adaptive integration a lot harder...


I admit, much of what I said is speculation based on intuitions I felt after reading you post. in fact there is a chance that you do have a physical/physiological problem (not necessarily) caused by a psychoactive substance. it just not very plausible given my experience and knowledge.


btw: I'm 99% sure you are alright. just don't be afraid! welcome to bluelight! ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


edit: didn't read your second post before sending my reply but now I'm even more convinced that your problem is psychosomatic. you seem to be a sensitive and reflected guy. and 6-apb is a powerful substance. this is a mixture that can lead to - let's say - challenging states.

alcohol is a shit drug btw. it's much more obviously toxic (for body&soul) than 6-apb. if you chose to consume it at least don't mix it with decent psychoactives...

Alcohol is a terrible, horrible, highly addictive drug. ![:p](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png) Your problem does sound psychosomatic. Maybe that's not the right word. Sounds like anxiety. Psychedelic, empathogenic, and stimulant substances (like 6-apb) can make an already present anxiety disorder worse. If you do see a doctor, I wouldn't mention that you've been using drugs. Anxiety can present itself in many, seemingly unrelated, ways. What you're experiencing does not sound like a side effect from 6-apb. Did you know your dose? Anyway, keep us posted.

Thank you for your replies, they have helped. 


In reply to your posts. As I said earlier, my experience was more and in the moment thing. I have had opportunities to try MD etc in the past but have always refused. The night I did, the majority of people were on similar stuff as well, I was also with one of my best friends who has done it several times before. He also made sure I was with him the whole night, to keep an eye on me etc. He kept giving me advice and guidance as well. If I was ever going to try it, it would have been best to do it that night given the set of conditions. I regret taking it now but I am young at the same time and I've learnt my lesson which is probably been the best thing about doing it.


I have done research before mainly because so many of friends do MD and other stuff, I thought in case I was to do it, I'd be prepared. I would say compared to a lot of people my age, I am educated when it comes to this sort of stuff. Mainly because I am lectured constantly about it by my friends. I am also aware of the media and their stance on drugs etc.


I agree my situation is maybe psychosomatic. I'm guessing the tingling etc has been bad today because I've been more worried about it hence the post on here. I think there's a link between how stressed/tired/worried I am, and the tingling. 


I still think it's best to go to the doctor anyway. Any more advice with regards to that? It might be best for me to get a check on my overall health. While the conversation between me and my parents and the doctor is not going to be ideal, I think it's probably best for me to tell them about what I took.

I did drink while on it but I didn't drink too much. I also took a week off of going out i.e. drinking after I had done it. This tingling sensation is just there, it's weird, I still just get on with life, it doesn't really effect me, I can do my work for university, still go out etc. It hasn't really effected my ability to do things, I still feel the same. The first two weeks I was tired/dazed, my friend even commented on it but I thought that was just normal. I feel fine now, it's just weird that it's still there as I thought it would go. One thing I have noticed, is that it's worse when I'm tired or after I've been drinking. Before Friday, I hadn't gone out in a good 12 days or so (I think) and I noticed it was getting better, although that could of been to do with the the fact that I was really busy. It's a weird sensation to explain, it's a bit like when say you've been studying all day and it's come to that point when your brain just needs a rest and feels fried.

I'm currently at uni, so I live away from home. The holidays are coming up in a week or so, so I'll probably see a doctor then when I'm back at home. It's just going to be an awkward conversation.

The most important thing is to not let yourself get too worried. Focusing on it will only bring it to light further and reinforces it. Now I'm not saying you can just will it away, but your thought process has to become more positive. As was mentioned, psychedelics are powerful enough to change how you feel and what you perceive, due to the brain's chemistry which is regulated to stay in an optimal condition which maintains your mental health. 


If you feel that concerned, and any amount of self-healing hasn't produced positive results (self-healing methods would be changing the way you think about the situation, physical activities like exercise, eating healthy foods and possibly taking a supplement, taking up a new hobby/project with some passion, meditation, or discussing it with friends and family and gaining support), don't be afraid to schedule an appointment with your General Practitioner. Talk it over with him/her. You could see a psychologist to discuss how you're feeling or even get a recommendation to a psychiatrist from your GP. I'm not a doctor, but from my experience and research, if physical sensation moves around, that can be an indicator of a psychosomatic illness. Also, sleep deprivation and alcohol will put a strain on your body, both physically and mentally, and will exacerbate any stress or anxiety . 


Just to let you know, many people have experienced slight changes after taking mind altering substances. Normally it takes time for the serotonin and dopamine (more complex than just these two transmitters) to once again be regulated so you can feel yourself again. Some cases require medication to speed up recovery and manage your neurotransmitter levels for you. It doesn't sound like you would need to be on medication, but honestly it comes down to what ever makes you feel better.  And if you have always worried, than an anti-anxiety med would probably not be a bad thing. Again, brush it off and don't let it consume you. I've been down that path recently and had to train myself with positive reinforcement. Though with how severe my condition was, I needed medication to counteract much of the chemical imbalance I had. Once the depression and the psychosis receded, I was better able to get a hold of my thought process and reduce the anxiety as I have always done. I also experienced the common "brain-zaps" which is directly related to serotonin modulation, as is seen from SSRI withdrawal.


I think what Johannes was attempting to convey was that you need to understand and take responsibility for doing something you may question, which may cause you to be in a conflicting state causing further stress because that's who you are, but at the same time you should use that acceptance to put it behind you and not let it hinder you. It's an experience that will make you stronger in the end. 


I didn't tell my parents what happened to me. I think I should have, but I didn't want them to worry plus I was ashamed considering I was the one to cause myself harm. I likely would have had more support then the select few friends I told. I was way out there though. Don't beat yourself up over it, it sounds like you are still doing very well. Anxiety can mimic so many ailments and cause your body to feel strained due to your sympathetic system being activated, and stress has a lot to do with it. I will say this though, the human body and brain are very resilient when it comes to repairing itself, especially in healthy individuals (ie no major hereditary diseases or lethal viruses).


There is stigma surrounding "drugs", which in some circumstances it's rightly so. Everyone's body chemistry is different, just like our perceptions, personality, genetics. You start messing with your chemistry, especially the ones that regulate thinking and feeling, and these psychoactives will have a wide range of effects, from intense blissful realizations and feeling one with everything, to extreme paranoia, fear, delusions, depersonalization/derealization, and with some drugs and personalities; addiction. They need to be respected. You *can* come away from either experience with more knowledge about yourself.


How you feel going into a session along with your preconceived notions will also drive how the event and subsequent recovery is going to turn out . Think about this scenario: You have been studying for one of your exams day in and day out, and come exam time, you feel extremely confident about passing the test. Since it was a final, you know you just solidified your "A". Barring any extreme circumstances, you will have felt great the entire day. Now on the flip side, you dicked around and hung out with friends, getting drunk and partying most of the semester and come exam day you didn't study, you are going to have a pretty shitty day. Your mind set is very important when your chemistry is being altered to such a degree.


Sorry for the long post. I hope it was beneficial to you and any others. Now back to our regularly scheduled "research". ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

Thanks a lot mate. Brilliant post, honestly really helped.


One of my positives is that I'm a good observer of myself if that makes sense. Like say, when I get ill, I know what to do and what I need to make myself feel better. I guess, I need to take that sort of mind set now. 


As I mentioned in my previous post, I was feeling better when I was at my busiest, not really thinking about the brain zaps (that's a good way to describe them, thanks) simply because I was too busy, eating well and just getting on with life. I think that's what I need to do now, everyone has helped massively on here but even just looking on here and posting in this thread is not really going to help me too much either I guess because it's just going to make me dwell on the problem. I think research in general is probably not going to be a good thing for me and my recovery. People on here have really helped and I'll definitely look at this thread for guidance again but some of the stuff on the internet just freaks you out even more which again probably hasn't helped by anxiety. 


Now that I look back to the experience, I was pretty nervous before doing it and that probably hasn't helped. Talking to mates who do it regularly they all say that you need to be in the right mind set before doing it which I probably wasn't looking back. I do have a worrying problem to be fair, that has gone slowly as I've got older, I worry much less now but it's probably something I still need to get help for. My parents are fully aware of me worrying too much about things as well.


Getting more exercise should be good for me and I'm definitely going to go to the doctors, probably mentioning my drug experience.

Just one last thing. Sorry to bang on but it has helped posting on here.


Looking back at the period where I was feeling better i.e. before last Friday, I have just noticed that my sleeping pattern was very good. I was going a bed at the same time every night and had a good routine. I noticed when I woke up yesterday (Saturday) I was shattered, more shattered than usual after a night out. Looking at it now, I think that was to do with breaking the routine I had going.

A difference me and my friends noticed on 6-APB as opposed to MDMA/MDA was that during the following week of use, there was a subtle irritation, less patience as you claim, and me and my GF and the couple that rolled with us argued more so than normal. A few other friends voiced the same concern after trying it. It could be just perception, but it was ironic that we all came to the same conclusion while discussing the side effects. The come up and euphoria were different too. More body load via the analogue and a clearer head during the peak and after.

I usually dose 150mg of 6-APB at a time. The effects have been great. I have submitted several trip reports over the last few months. My last order of 6-APB took over a month to arrive. Actually, it never arrived. I just ordered some from a different vendor. I had been pre-loading all month with 100mg of 5-HTP a day.

Sounds awesome :D I've come close to this with high doses (less weakness, visuals intense but not so much as that, I'd say..), excepted I puked at the beginning.

Nice report jag.  I am going for 250mg next week powder.  I've had doses 220-230 before but not had your full experience. I've taken to having htp daily Just cos I find it keeps my mood up.  Possible trip benefits an added plus. I was wondering if others have had 250 mg plus and how that had been. Also wondered if anyone has experience of using two 125mg pellets and any perceived differences from powder.  Cheers

...yesterday I had a 175mg daytrip(that dose pushed me in ++++ territory once) at massive outdoor mayday-techno-party. optional 7mg of 4-aco-dmt.

it was manageable but it's one the edge when there are many people. it's not anxious but the permanent onslaught of transferences is just a little bit too much (exhausting). in fact I spend most of the time on our blanket-base with co-trippers. didn't even visit the dancefloor. tried playing frisbee [usually very experienced] but the feedback between the emotion "*fear*; don't wanna hit anyone" and our physical/mental skills was too pronounced - generalization leads to typical 6-apb epiphany.

skipped the 4-aco-dmt. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

actual peak was 4-5 hours, but the aftereffects are generally worthwhile and enjoyable. there is no crash, not even a real comedown. after 10-12h you're just exhausted and want to sleep, which was still difficult (in spite of smoking joint after joint). felt enlightened enough to ride it out and skipped the benzo. today I'm still quite exhausted but no severe unwanted mental/physical effects whatsoever. feels ok as it is.


6-apb never lets me down. it's a wonderful substance. the emotional clarity is amazing. imo it's more a of learning experience or: sequence of learning experiences than "true [5-ht2a]psychedelics". 6-apb allows you to tackle everyday problems in a very grounded and natural but deep way - while covering you in a blanket of spiritual euphoria and serenity. ![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif)


I'm really, really interested in mescaline (finding a suitable cactus is a hassle). can anyone compare the 2?

Not bad! 150mg is my sweet spot for feeling that way. 200mg and more (as with the other night) and the psychedelia is too much to be that functional.

...yes; ime higher doses than 175mg [never went higher actually, as I was **absolutely** satisfied with that dose before] demand a *safe* setting. it was not overwhelming/uncomfortable this time but I think I would have gotten more out of it in a different setting - also felt a lot weaker than my previous 175mg experience, but that was ++++-territory...not easily reproducible.

obviously ymmv - for me this is mainly a therapeutic substance. or: too valuable to waste it for hedonistic purposes.


btw, I preloaded with: 3 days in advance 150mg of 5-htp, strong ginger tea, 4mg loperamide (having the shits on an outdoor festival, completely fucked up on a psychedelic substance is unfavorable ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)), god knows how much of magnesium before and during the experience and 1000mg of piracetam. everything was very clear&clean, no serious side effects. can't say much about the piracetam but at one point I remember I mentioned that "i can feel it but this setting is too fast to let it shine". piracetam will be involved in my next "safe setting"-experience for sure. for a many-people setting I'd probably skip it.


what about the side effects at 200mg? I guess the vasoconstriction and bruxsim do become an issue...?

Yes... And... it's been a couple of days, and today I've just been such a worrisome fellow. I'm just so damned worried about everything: finances, health... I never get this *hopelessly* worried and nervous -- anxious. I am pinning this on playing with the chemicals. I'm just telling myself that it's not nearly as bad as I think it is, I'm just taking it too hard.


OH MY GOD! I'M NOT TAKING IT TOO HARD. THINGS ARE REALLY BAD RIGHT NOW! OH MY GOD!!


Just kidding. That would suck, though, wouldn't it? :D

recently i was reading a bit about these x-APB compounds on wikipedia and found this:


> 6-APB is a triple monoamine reuptake inhibitor with Ki values of 117, 150 and 2698 for NET, DAT and SERT respectively as well as being a potent agonist for the 5-HT2B receptor (Ki 3.7nM).[1] The subjective effects and structure–activity relationship suggest that it is also a releasing agent.

I always was under the impression that these drugs were monoamine releasers like MDMA and the like. are the wikipedia articles incorrect or not?

"There is now an abundance of evidence, both experimental and clinical, that MDMA and the other ring-substituted amphetamine derivatives act by increasing the net release of the monoamine neurotransmitters (serotonin, noradrenaline and, to a smaller extent, dopamine) from their respective axon terminals.3,26,27 MDMA does not act by directly releasing serotonin but, rather, by binding to, and thus blocking, the transporter involved in its reuptake.3,28,29" [http://www.cmaj.ca/content/165/7/917.full](http://www.cmaj.ca/content/165/7/917.full)


Some background information: There are a bunch of monoamine neurotransmitters in humans. Some are tryptamines, like serotonin and melatonin. Others are catecholamines, like dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine. There are also histamines and other trace amines.


The abbreviations NET, DAT, and SERT refer to different monamine transporters: norepinephrine transporters, dopamine transporters, and serotonin transporters, respectively.


"Ki is the symbol for the dissociation constant of an inhibitor; in enzyme kinetics, Kii reflects the values of Ki that affect the intercept of a double-reciprocal plot, whereas Kis reflects the values of Ki that affect the slope of the same plot." ([http://www.biology-online.org/dictionary/Ki](http://www.biology-online.org/dictionary/Ki) "The inhibitor constant Ki is the concentration of inhibitor which is required to decrease the maximal rate of the reaction to half of the uninhibited value, in the presence of a low substrate concentration. Therefore, the lower the Ki the lower the concentration of inhibitor needed to lower the rate." [http://dwb4.unl.edu/Chem/CHEM869K/C...S/DEPT/biochemistry/kinetics/HTML/PAGE21.HTML](http://dwb4.unl.edu/Chem/CHEM869K/CHEM869KLinks/jeffline.tju.edu/CWIS/DEPT/biochemistry/kinetics/HTML/PAGE21.HTML)


"In pharmacology, an "agonist" is a drug that has an affinity for and stimulates physiologic activity at cell receptors normally stimulated by naturally occurring substances." [http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Agonists](http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Agonists)


However... "New findings that broaden the conventional definition of pharmacology demonstrate that ligands can concurrently behave as agonist and antagonists at the same receptor, depending on effector pathways or tissue type. Terms that describe this phenomenon are "functional selectivity", "protean agonism",[4][5] or selective receptor modulators.[6]" [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agonist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agonist) Something interesting to keep in mind.


I have read all over the place that 6-APB is a serotonin releasing agent. (That's why it's nice to take 5-HTP afterward, to help restore depleted reserves.) My own experiences with 6-APB support this.


So, yep, 6-APB is both a monoamine reuptake inhibitor and thought to be a releasing agent of 5-HT (serotonin), DA (dopamine), and NE (norepinephrine).


I'm such a novice biochemist, but I want to learn! I'm confused about how Ki is measured. Can anyone help me understand this better?

yes, it's mainly a releasing agent. the serotonin release is very likely mediated through the 5-HT2B receptor ([look here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5-HT2B_receptor#Function); especially the footnote 3 is interesting). based on SSRIs attenuating or killing the entactogen effects (and the high Ki values for i.e. 6-APB for serotonin reuptake inhibition), i would even say that reuptake inhibition is working against serotonin release.


a reuptake inhibitor at 5-ht2 is impossible. reuptake inhibition means that it inhibits the function of SERT, which is not associated with specific serotonin receptors.

hi everyone. I did like 20-30 mg ethylphenidate this morning. I really want to do some 6-APB tonight, would this be a bad idea? Let's say 6-8 hours after I did ethylphenidate I take the 6APB.

What I would suspect, with what concentration of ethylphenidate, with a four-hour half-lilfe, is left in your system at eight hours later, will not contraindicate 6-APB, in my opinion.

Very interesting - I've read all the 6-APB threads and there seems to be a really, really wide variety of reactions and experiences.  I am awaiting an order and really hope it arrives at all, let alone in time for a music festival next weekend, and isn't bullshit/a bad batch.


I am curious as to good dosage for an urban setting mostly-daytime techno-oriented music festival, with afterparties around the city which I do not know my way around at all.  I weigh 125 pounds and generally eat like I'm being graded on my nutrition.  Have used MDMA (or things parading as MDMA) maybe 4 or 5 times prior, always in pretty small, not precisely measured doses, never MDA.  Only psychedelics have been mushrooms.  Last shroom trip was early February and last MDMA was November.  I guess I'm a little more interested in the "enhanced dancing" part than the "trippy" part since I'll be in a crowded semi public space.


We'll be staying at a hotel next to the venue so I was planning to lay low for the first hour or so in case I get sick.  All the accounts of horrible explosive diarrhea for days after is not promising seeing as the end of the festival = 10 hour car ride home, but I guess adult-sized diapers exist for that reason.

I'd say 125mg. Every time I do that amount, I roll HARD with eye wiggles and everything, but it's manageable. I was in a cramped electronic club during my first experience, hot and sweaty as hell, my shirt drenched 100%, and was fine.


Also, I didn't experience any diarrhea, at least the pushy kind that needs to come out RIGHT NOW.

I weigh 125 pounds and generally eat like I'm being graded on my nutrition.  Have used MDMA (or things parading as MDMA) maybe 4 or 5 times prior, always in pretty small, not precisely measured doses, never MDA.  Only psychedelics have been mushrooms.  Last shroom trip was early February and last MDMA was November.  I guess I'm a little more interested in the "enhanced dancing" part than the "trippy" part since I'll be in a crowded semi public space.

Loperamide aka immodium ad is wonderful for avoiding the next 2 days on the toilet.


Do you know what form your 6-apb is in? HCl or succinate? It seems to greatly affect your dosage.

Came in the mail a week after order. Vendor doesn't follow their own policy of not shipping to my country apparently.  I only have a Marquis test kit - tested brown, then really dark brown, then black - I've seen mixed reviews saying 5 tests brown/black and 6 tests purple/black.  No fizz so I would guess not HCl.  It is off-white and really fluffy and flour-like.

My 6-APB was very fluffy and exactly like flour, dosing it out was always a terrible time.

Quick question for all your APB heads! In about 3 weeks, I'll possibly be having a experience on 6-APB with a close female friend of mine. I have experience of the 60/50mg 6/5APB combo, but never either-or alone. Therefore, what I would like to know is this: My plan was to drop 150mg of 6-APB as I really want to have a intense and euphoria filled experience, although I was wondering what the empathy/tactile enhancement is like on 6 alone? Considering the female friend in question, I have been wondering if I will need to add 50mg or so of 5-APB to get any tactile enhancement/empathy, or will the 6APB alone be enough? 


Cheers


SR

150mg of 6-apb has always been plenty tactile IME.

I weigh a tad less than 175 at the moment (more around 170) due to I have been slamming the cardio over the past few weeks, so I'm assuming 150mg for me will be plenty. In regards to my female friend, she is around 5"3  (she has a few experieces with high-dose MDMA) but should I dose her slightly lower?


In regards to the experience itself, how intense is the come-up/ euphoria on 150mg? I've read many a report stating that 125mg doesn't really get you to where you want to be (hence my higher dose), and considering I'm used to the eye-rolling madness that are PartyFlock/MortalKombat pills, I don't want to end up dissappointed!


If anyone can add any of their experiences using this dose, it would be great :D

If you want eye-rolling madness, as you put it, then I might suggest 175mg for you, 150mg for her. I personally would turn it into a hedonistic sex-trip. But nahhhhh, if you haven't played w/ any MDxx chemicals or other serotonin affecting ones in a couple of months or more, then you should be good. Keep some marijuana around for the end...


I'm kind of jealous. Nothing is quite like the first time, and to spend it with your lover, priceless.


Let me offer you some of my trip reports and thoughts:

Cheers for the feedback mate, I'll have a read through the links now! In terms of my dosage, would 175mg be too high considering its my first experience with 6APB alone ( I have done 60/50 of 5&6 apb about a year back)..I read a report by jesusgreen which stated 150mg was really intense, but just about right. I do have MDMA at my disposal, but I'm after something which lasts a tad longer than MDMA, as I find that after about 5 hours,  most of the euphoria is gone and Im just left with a glow/jaw clenching.


In terms of nausea, what can I expect? Whilst I have never felt nausea on either MDMA or APB's, my female companion has often felt naseous coming up on high doses of MDxx, so I'm just hoping she doesn't vomit her 6-APB up. Hopefully though the empathy with 6-APB is up there with good ol' MDMA :D


EDIT: Forgot to ask, whats 6-APB at 150mg-ish like on the heart? I'm no stranger to 200mg of MDMA, but I'm just wondering what the comparison in terms of blood-pressure/temp rise is between these two? If I'm going to be in a club when I drop, I want to be aware of my HR if I'll be dancing. My HR on MDMA usually lowers after the come-up.

I bet most of your questions are answered in those links, but just in case:


As far as being tough on the heart -- 6-APB didn't seem to stress my heart or respiratory at all. Even when I went crazy with the higher dosages.


Stick with 150mg -- I suspect it will be your sweet spot, too. As for your lady friend, mybe 125mg is the way to go.


There will be nausea. Just hold it down. If you are able to dry-retch, then do it! Because it's after that reflex that "the buzz finds the groove." On an empty stomach, by the time the impulse to vomit comes around, hopefully most of the chemical has been broken down and absorbed, so even if you did throw up, you would already be on your way.


I've come to anticipate the nausea eagerly, as it means the show's about to start.


And if you are going out ... oh boy... you may not want to take 150mg of 6-APB after all. lol

Not for me! Not at all. Great bloodflow. Almost as good as what I used to call "Viagra-dope." (And that was from a pseudo-MDA synth of my own from the old days where I was playing with a botched methamphetamine synth... Also nearly killed me. Worst psychotic episode of my life. -- shouldn't need to be afraid of that w/ the APB though.)

Good news for me then :D I know the APB experiene lasts a long while in regards to residual stim, but it terms of the euphoria etc, did you find it lasted longer than MDMA? From the reports I've head, the opinions seem to differ based on the dosage. Although I'm assuming with 150mg, I won't sleep much inside of 12 hours...time to buy a crate of beer to get me to sleep!

Someone else will have to answer this one. I have never experienced MDMA.

I know, right?!


I always enjoy some marijuana at the end of an APB trip. It's like pulling in to the motel after a long ass drive across country. Feels good to stretch out and pass out.

Everyone should experience MDMA, especially if they are taking analogues are drugs which are designed to be a replacement of MDMA/MDA; its nice to get a feel for the 'gold standard' so to speak.


How about some MXE at the tail end? I just hope the APB's don't lock up my bladder for like 12 hours....MDMA at high doses makes urinating a issue for a good few hours until the comedown.

Awww, shux. Heck, even ED ought to be a subforum of PD. Based on a lot of what I've read, (since I've never tried MDMA), simply being such a strong empathogen makes it a psychedelic, right? And 6-APB, in my experience, has potent mind-expansioning properties. While I'm a relatively new member of the forum, and know my opinion carries very little weight, I thought I might as well be the first to mention it.


Further, should there be a need for a new moderator with APB experience, I offer my time and services.

Don't you worry, we got it ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


and no, MDMA has psychedelic qualities but it is far from LSD. MDMA releases serotonin, psychedelics usually just bind to it. Since MDMA and 6-APB and similar chemicals actually cause a depletion in serotonin that other psychedelics do not, they need to be treated differently


Hope that explains ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Works for me, although the results of my own research on MDMA and APBs is that they work primarily as SSRI's and don't directly release serotonin, and bind (as you mentioned psychedelics do earlier) and block the transporter involved in its reuptake. (Admittedly ending up in a net increase in the release of serotonin from the axon terminals.)


Cheers!

I expect that if the opportunity to experience high-quality MDMA comes, I shall jump at it. However, the war on drugs in the USA has been pretty effective at keeping this one away from me.

6-APB is one that really interests me... I mean I have a good stock of both MDMA and MDA on hand... but still, with some saying they actually prefer it and that it is longer lasting and more psychedelic, one has to wonder. Kind of pricey though, a gram is more expensive than a G of MDMA. Not quite as expensive as MDA, though.

Dont the dosage on the apbs tend to be smaller though. Wouldnt a gram go further than MDxx?

I've always heard of it being at around the same potency as MDA.. 100-120mg is a light dose with 150mg+ being rather heavy


Not that I'm taking grams of anything on the reg lol, that much can usually last me a year or so.

No I think that's because MDMA is cheap to manufacture and is made in large quantities. 6-apb is quite hard to make in comparison. There's no reason why MDA should be expensive to make, the higher price is due to lower demand.

Well, I know I won't be taking 7 or 8 or 9-APB even if they are psychoactive, lol


7-APB would be the analogue of 6-APB which analogue of MDA which is itself an analogue of MDMA.... that is just fucking sketchy to me haha, I'd rather stick with the known tested drugs than be a guinea pig.

I'm with Folley on this one. Even if 7-APB was active, considering the APB's themselves are not particularly clean, the effects profile of 7-APB would possibly be either underwhelming or even dirtier effects wise...

Just because something is an analog of something else doesn't mean that it is particularly dirtier or more dangerous than any of its analogs. An analog of something else just means it is compositionally comparable/similar to something else.

That's about the relevant MDA analogue from PIHKAL. So it would probably be active, but I'd be shocked if it was good.

every time i have consumed 6-apb i have had an amazing time, just as good as mdma and it lasts for a full 6 hours


smoking bud on the comedown is also very good


now i have a question, has anyone candy flipped 6-apb with lsd or any nbome's? would it be safe?

With such a smooth comedown and similar durations, do you think dosing at the same time would work? 

NBOMe would come up within 30, 6-apb at like 45 minimum, so comeups aren't intensifying each other

I wouldn't dose at the same time. The intensity will ramp up quite a lot on the combo, so you might just wanna feel one by itself first.

well I've got a fair bit of experience with the 6, and will have with the nbome when it comes to actually doing it. I was thinking probably no more than 110mg 6-apb and 'a tab' whatever that is in actual mass... 2 is my standard dose.

Hey guys!


My 6-APB was seized at an int'l border because we took a wrong turn after driving out of our way to avoid borders - faaaaaail. Got a letter from them saying I can petition to get it back but I checked "Abandon Property."  Maybe someday I'll find it again.


One in our party took 50mg in the car and was experiencing crazy vasoconstriction and started rolling while we were detained at the border facility. Not sure he can be used as a guideline as he is on SSRIs and rolled INTENSELY for 6 hours after taking a comparably small dose of MDMA.

^ 6-apb has a longer duration than MDMA. 6h+ is about right.

^I'd getup and start *LIGHTLY* dancing or go for a walk or something. That kind of hear rate on simulants is relatively normal, but obviously is high. Just get some blood flowing so your heart actually has something to do rather than sit still and pump blood to the same places all day

Finally got around to it day before yesterday. I am 55 kg, two others are 100 kg and ~70 kg, all capped 50 mg and had a GREAT time.  Went out to dance, comeup took 1-1.5 hours, no nausea or GI distress aside from the usual "need to take a moment to deeply exhale a few times."  By far the best music enhancer, better than MDMA, floaty descent, no urge to redose.  


I would probably rate 6-APB the PERFECT festival/afterparty drug and dose at like, 4 or 5 PM.  For "regular" nights that don't get going until late, your chances of sleeping are slim to nil.

Some people call it "benzo fury" but I don't think that's too common.  Just 6-APB.


If you're in North America, good luck.  I placed a legal order online just before the UK ban on June 10.

I heard that the batches that went out at the very end were supposedly shit, and cut, and better vendors refused to sell them. Everyone was dumping the stuff that was synthesized sub-par. Scary stuff. Hope you recover quickly, yar.

Thanks Just A Guy.  The vendor I used was rated very highly but you never know.  I experienced zero unpleasant effects during the experience itself - I think this is probably just what happens, if MDA anecdotes and experiences are anything to go by.

You shouldn't be feeling this way for this long. Even when I enjoyed a 200mg experience I was back to normal 2 nights of sleep later.

I've been eating and sleeping well/normally, just feel a little moody from time to time.  I am very sensitive to "bad vibes" and conflict generally and I think ending the evening badly (people around me getting angry) has stuck with me somehow.  200 mg is intense - how did you not die/shit yourself?


Obviously zero desire to put myself through that again for many months.

I have an unusually high jois de vivre -- it's part of why I enjoy psychedelics so much. lol


My trip report is here: [http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/...IENCED-quot-Let-the-Buzz-Find-the-Groove-quot](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/674907-6-APB-200-mg-EXPERIENCED-quot-Let-the-Buzz-Find-the-Groove-quot)


I find that dosing low ends up me chasing a high that never came, and that is in itself a real bummer! Hopefully your future experiences have better results! ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Tryed 200mg of 6-apb last tue and it was great felt less energetic but more sexual than mdma  ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif) that lasted about 7 hrs then went trippy for 4 hrs, comedown was horrible lasted 2 days but I did take mdma 2 days before.

Has anyone experienced twitches the night of the 6-APB comedown that continues even into the next day?  These only seem to occur when trying to fall asleep or when just beginning to fall asleep and cause the person to jolt awake.  I have seen this in 5 of my friends multiple times although I haven't experienced it myself at all.  Doses were all around 125-175mg.

Feeling baseline, normal, maybe better than normal today.  I think I just needed to drag myself to the gym to pick some things up and put them down.


Just A Guy, I read your report while I was waiting for my first order to arrive - I am sort of emetophobic so I don't think high doses are in my future!  


mozokev, no twitches (only 50 mg for me), but I did have overwhelming CEVs as I tried to sleep.  Insane shit I can't describe - similar to what you see on acid when you blink really fast. Between open and closed eye visuals, if that makes sense.

Probably not, yeah.


A friend is heading to a festival with 100mg 6-APB. He's gonna have a great time. I'm interested to see how 100 affects him since he's my height, a few years older, and maybe 20 lbs heavier.

Just a guy re preban apbs I bought 10g 6apb but it's different from the stuff I bought a month before.  This is light brown not tan and less fluffy.  Smells similar but not same.  Seems more speedy like 5 but with a bit of nausea I never had before.  I'm cutting it in at about one third and seems ok.  Wonder if anyone has more info

Meant to add have puked every time over 250 mg.  3 times with all  eing redoses of 100 on 200 approx.  never managed a trial of a straight 300mg as discussed before, just sense it will be difficult.

**The best ever in my opinion**


I'm new here but just wanted to chime in to this thread.  I guess I'm sort of a 6-apb veteran, with over a hundred experiences.  My take is its the best substance I've ever tried, period. I get reliably to a state of "in the moment" euphoria and love each and every time.  I don't seem to ever need to dose higher to get same effects. No urge to redose (with the booster regimen I use) and the hangover is a blissful afterglow (slight headache the second day tho)  It doesn't seem to be addictive - I've been using it once a week for ever and not really tempted to do it more often. Whats not to love?


If anybody cares to hear the dose regimen I've honed over a couple years of use, here it is...

1st off, having an empty stomach makes a BIG difference in effects. My advice is not to eat anything for at least 3 hours before dosing. If you eat beforehand, it'll really reduce the effects.

- Initial dose 160-180mg powder

  This is for the immersive couch potato experience.  If you're going 

  to be doing stuff in public I wouldn't go over 100

- Take a booster of 80mg 1.5 hours after the first dose

  6-apb takes 2 hours to kick in so you won't be feeling the full effects

  of the first dose yet.  This booster does 2 things - it extends the

  effects of the first dose quite a bit, and also if you just do one big dose

  by itself, there can be a sharp comedown with an urge to redose.  

  By taking the booster, the effects slowly taper over a longer period, 

  and the urge to redose is pretty much eliminated.

- (optional) a 35mg redose 1.5 hours after the first redone - This just 

  provides an even smoother comedown and extends (less intense) blissy 

  effects for a bit longer.


Like I said above the next day is usually kind of a nice afterglow feeling, but

the second day can be a little rough, with a slight headache and tiredness.

A couple of 5-htp  supplements throughout the day keep it in check - avoid

caffeine though as the headache will come roaring back.

Once a week is...very frequent.  What setting are you dosing that much in?  


Just ordered a bunch of 6-APDB, which I've read is even better than 6-APB.  Thoughts?

Just dropped a fat 200mg bomb. This is going to be a good night.


Edit: I'll be sure to write a brief trip report, hence why I posted in the first place.

Ok, so the come-up didn't start till 1.5 hours after ingestion, whereas usually (with a lower dose, too) it takes 45 mins. The peak came on quite quickly, which made up for the long onset. I then peaked for about 6 hours, riding the waves which are so characteristic of 6-APB. There were slight visual distortions: morphing, and brightening of light and colour. I didn't trip as much as I usually do, probably because I'd taken 25I-NBOMe 5 days prior to this experience - thus draining my 5-HT2A receptors (responsible for tripping).


The roll was very good. I didn't have any nausea at all, whereas last time I tried 200mg I had slight nausea for about 5-10 mins (didn't vomit though). I did have diarrhoea during the come-up and the day after, but literally every single drug gives me this (usually just during the come-up). My body did get very hot, however, and has been hot for all of the following day. Taking off my clothes was sufficient to keep me cool. The weather is unusually hot right now, and normally heat isn't too much of an issue - more of a nuisance, really.


200mg really is the sweet-spot for me. 100mg was unimpressive, 125mg was comfortable but nothing amazing, 150mg was getting there but still nothing to be excited about. YMMV, of course, but I personally feel that the various dosage guides that can be found online are quite a bit low.


Also, people judge how high they are by how high they've been before. I usually don't dose any drug high enough to be considered "unsafe" - if one could say that - but I have had a few extremely intense experiences. Thus my self-analysis of how high I am is much stricter than that of someone's who hasn't dosed a drug high before. To be honest, I'd much rather be satisfied by lower doses than have to dose medium-high all the time, but my very first drug experience was almost an overdose (due to incorrectly giving trust of dosage to a friend), thus my expectations have been high from the very start.


My dosage philosophy is very simple: start at medium-high, and then increase until I feel that increasing more would give a low effects/side-effects ratio. Also, I only redose on stimulants. Drugs like 6-APB last pretty long, leaving me very satisfied and not wanting more. What's more, the come-down comes in waves, too, so it's never shocking or disappointing when it happens.

Well I suppose once a week might sound frequent.  But I don't drink, smoke weed or even take any prescription meds right now.

One dose of 6-apb per week as the ONLY intoxicant I use - still sound like alot?  ![:-)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I liked reading that report David.  Only thing I'd comment on is the dosage.  I would bet that if your stomach was very empty (like no eating for 3 hours prior) then a 180mg dose would likely put you in the same place.   Evewryone's MMV obviously, but when I did 200mg on a completely empty stomach - my heart rate got a little high.

I didn't eat for 7 hours prior to the experience. My heart rate was increased, although every stimulating drug increases my heart rate. It didn't reach dangerous or uncomfortable levels at any point. The only drugs that have ever made my heart rate way too high are AM-2201 and 5F-AKB-48 (both synthetic cannabinoids). All other synthnoids I have tried, I have loved.


Thanks for reading my post and I'm glad you raised concern over the dosage, because I will admit it seems pretty high compared to average. I have read people saying that their sweetspot is 250-300mg, and I personally feel that may be too much, so I sympathise if one thinks 200mg is too much.

It does if you subscribe to the idea that MDA/MDMA/X-APBs should be used no more frequently than once a month, which many, many people choose to.  However, you would probably know if you were starting to develop a tolerance that ruined the magic and then stop - so keep doing what works for you!


Personally I found my experience at 50 mg so overwhelming that I don't even want it again.  Think my next dose will be on a long weekend at the beach with absolutely nothing to do, several fully charged devices that play music, and my significant other.

Nope, still sounds excessive to me. It's nothing to do with other drugs or general health, the only factor is the risk of SERT damage from SRAs like 6-APB.

Please realize that 6-apb might very well be MUCH less damaging to the serotonin system than than MDMA. It is quite likely that MDMA neurotoxicity (or temporary damage) occurs because MDMA is metabolized by the liver to 3,4-dihydroxyamphetamine (also called alfa-methyldopamine). This is known neurotoxin. MDMA injected directly into the brain is not neurotoxic. 3,4-dihydroxyamphetamine reacts with gluthathione (as far as I can remember) to form a compound wich is toxic to cells, and causes free radicals to be formed via a series of reactions. It is also a common misconception that dopamine metabolites is responsible for MDMA neurotoxicity, dopamine increases neuroxicity as higher dopamine levels mean a higher body temperature, and the higher the body temperature, the less efficient is body's antioxidant system for protecting against free radical damage. MDMA metabolites also inhibit tryptophane hydroxylase, and thus serotonin is regenerated slower than normal.


I dont know if 6-apb forms metabolites wich inhibit TPH, but I do know the neurotoxic 3,4-dihydroxyamphetamine can't be formed from 6-apb, thus potentially making it a much less neurotoxic and safer compound (ofcourse it might have other metabolites even more toxic which are not studied), and where tolerance is less of an issue. I wouldn't be surprised if it takes much longer to lose the magic of 6-apb than that of MDMA/MDA .


I am eager to buy 6-apb and 5-apb and if the combination really is that good comparable to MDMA/MDA, I might never touch the latter two again (or maybe once a year) as they seem to be more damaging.

I agree that 6-APB is likely to be less neurotoxic than MDMA, but I strongly doubt it will be harmless enough to use weekly.

Probably not, that dose is very low and the effects would be subtle enough that you'd probably be able to sleep fine after the experience had faded.

Well all I can report is my own subjective experience.  Ive used it once a week for 2 years and here's what Ive found - there is a sort of hangover 2 days after I use it - slight headache, and tiredness, and a slightly down mood, but I wouldn't call it depression or a "suicide tuesday" like you hear about on mdma.  After that second day, I'm my usual happy self, and have noticed no mood swings, depression, or any other changes that would suggest anything amiss with my serotonin levels.  Of course things could be happening behind the scenes that I haven't noticed yet - But 2 years and >100 doses later, if anything I am at least as happy and balanced now (if not more so) than before I started taking it.  I take 5-htp supplements so that may help me, not sure.

IMO, these class of drugs (6-APB, MDMA, etc.) have a sort of threshold that needs to be reached in order to feel much of anything. When I first dipped my finger into 6-APB I took 40mg and literally felt nothing. A month later I took 60mg and felt very subtle effects.  On my third attempt another month later I took 90mg and was "blinded" with euphoria and eye wiggles. Just my experience but this has also been the same with MDMA.

I would just like to add - 6APB in my experience was absolute poison. Gave me brain zaps which lasted a month, terrible vasoconstriction, temperature fluctuations, naesea and fever-like closed eye visuals. Granted, the 6-APB was dropped the night after doing 500mg of pure MDMA, so the blame does not all lay with 6-APB (as I have had a positive experience previously about 2 years prior on a 5/6apb pellet), but even so - never again.

I observed a lot of vasoconstriction/chills in the first hour to hour and a half, then I started dancing but didn't feel particularly overheated aside from the usual "stop moving, have some cold water" - I did have a couple drinks though which always makes me feel hot and flushed, so difficult to tell.


Still wondering if someone slipped 6-APDB in my 6-APB package since I had such a monstrous roll off 50 mg.  Either way I have some of the former on its way...we shall see.  I'm in no hurry whatsoever to put my brain through that much excitement again.

^ Evidence that alpha-methyl-dopamine isn't the cause or sole cause of MDMA neurotoxicity. This is a fairly old theory and now most people agree that the neurotoxicity of MDMA and similar compounds is a lot more complex and a lot of factors come into play. I think it would be VERY hasty and misguided to assume that 6-APB and related compounds aren't neurotoxic simply due to the lack of formation of alpha-methyl-dopamine.


Even if it was less neurotoxic than MDMA, or even if by a stroke of chance it was completely free from neurotoxicity it's still going to cause receptor down-regulation, and this down-regulation requires a time period of recovery before everything goes back to normal. Overuse will result in anxiety, depression, mood swings, and reduced positive effects from the drug itself and related drugs - which may or may not be long term, similar to loss of magic with MDMA.


Just speaking from personal experience and anecdotal experiences alone I can say that overuse results in severe long term negative effects. After taking 6-APB 8 times last summer in 2 and a half months, I experienced brain zaps for several weeks along with pretty bad anxiety and anhedonia that persisted for several months. It was only about 6 months later when I finally fully felt back to normal. That's after just 8 doses - imagine how bad it can get if you continue dosing every week for longer than that.


If my own testimony isn't enough to convince you, of the group of friends I spend most of my time with in real life, 4 of them were also taking 6-APB every week or two for a period of 2-3 months, varying from person to person. All of them experienced the same problems as me afterwards and one of them completely isolated himself from all social contact for the next 4 months avoiding anybody because he became so anxious and depressed.


In my personal experience I've actually found 6-APB to have a worse effect in this respect than MDMA itself does, and I can tell you without a shadow of a doubt 6-APB weekly is something you certainly don't want to be continuing. Stick to once a month or less.


I know how lovely 6-APB is, and I too tried to convince myself that it was okay to do it more often, but as I found out for myself it's definitely not something you want to be using that frequently if you value your health.

^^Very true. However, there are others such as 'Si Ingwe' (a member on here), who also suffered what we call a ABP Crisis, in which a few sub 100mg uses of 5-MAPB gave him crippling brain-zaps, suicidal thoughts etc (I'l let him fill you in on the rest). Whilst I totally agree that I screwed up with my excessive and stupid use of SRA's in this instance, I stand by my theory that for a select few, the APB's are really poisonous (somehow) to your serotonin system.

I've never had troubles with the APB's as long as you eat healthy, exercise and don't take them more than once a month.

^^The same rule applies to MDMA though. Some use MDMA once, and then complain of DP/DR, anxiety etc, whillst others can use it (in moderation) without issue. I'm sure if I had just used 6-APB I would of been fine, however 6-APB felt far more toxic/dirty to the body than MDMA.....

I agree that 6-APB feels somewhat more toxic and dirty on your body. But this might be because of the longer duration. Sleeping is also out of the question on 6-APB, which can contribute to hangover and post-anorexia, where with MDMA it's often not a big issue after 6-7 hours to sleep and feel refreshed the following day.


In general, sleep deprivation is pretty neglected cause of hangover, but in my opinion it's the largest factor.

This. Hydration and Nutrition closely follow ime. Theres nothing better than a great cosy sleep followed by a large breakfast and some water in the morning no matter what the compound.


sixtyflipping sounds awesome. Timing would be fairly similar to a candyflip but a bit earlier.

Did read a report on 6-apb/an nbome maybe? could have been lsd, it said the 6 overwhelmed the other to the point of nonexistance but i suppose its all dose dependant.

I tried 1mg 25I-NBOMe + 125mg 6-APB. The experience felt like each substance alone, but at the same time. I dosed at the same time. I'm not sure I'd repeat the experience though, given the amount of vasoconstriction.

6-APB and LSD

I can't comment on LSD but combining with 4-aco-dmt was one of the best experiences I've ever had.  I say go for it!


With 6=apb and 4-aco-dmt I had four +4 experiences in a row on it, and I thought I'd found the elusive "repeatable +4 experience"   but then the fifth time I did the combo the magic was gone

At a festival last week, my friend had 250mg of 6-apb in 2 lots. Had the 1st 125mg and waited over 2 hours then dropped the 2nd 125mg.    


Not sure what happened after that but he was starting to feel pretty rough ad went very cold and went a grey colour and his lips went a bit blue. I took him into a dance tent to warm up and after another hour he was feeling ok-ish. I never redosed at that point as I was feeling good off the 1st bomb. He was not getting much off the 1st bomb so opted to re-dose.


Just a reminder/warning to others that 6-apb can take > 2 hours to take effect and redosing withing 2 hours is probably not recommended. YMMV.


My friend is very experienced with MDMA but said he had never felt so fucked ...................TBH I was a bit concerned with his grey colour. I just hoped it was a monstor comeup taking its toll. Anyway, he was ok and carried on taking more 6-apb ober the weekend.


I seriously prefer 6-APB for a 2 day binge (no sleep!).

I think 6-APB is far better than 5-APB in every way in terms of effects. 5-APB to me feels like boosted MDAI, i.e. sedating but more powerful and longer-lasting. This is my experience, and I have read that many find 5-APB quite stimulating. Maybe what I had wasn't in fact the real deal, or maybe it was them who had bunk product. Maybe it's all of us.


6-APB to me has just the right level of stimulation to be appropriate for any situation. I still haven't taken it in a club, but I've taken it in daytime, night-time, alone, with friends, at home, outside, and it's always been superb. I find overheating a consistent problem. I get this with most drugs, but this drug is the worst in this respect. Jaw trembling is treated with chewing gum, sweating is forgiven, cool down breaks are had, and a good time is a guarantee. No bad comedown but severe lethargy the next day.

What because he went grey and was cold. Man you need to read about serotonin syndrome before passing diagnosis about. That sounds fuck all like serotonin syndrome. He was fine a few hours later and continued taking more 6-apb the following day.  All that probably happened was both doses hit him at once. The come up of a high dose of 6-apb will fuckup most people as it hits like a sledgehammer at high doses.


The actual occurrences of serotonin syndrome (apart from on this forum) is very rare and is usually induced by combining a Serotonin releasing drug and a MAOI.

I had 64mg of the HCl salt on saturday, supposed to be equivalent to 70mg of the succinate salt but actually felt it was markedly stronger than that, more like 90mg at least. I suspect this is a result of the succinate content being much higher than it should be. Unfortunately the freebase seems rather unstable so I only got 25% yield in the conversion. I would not bother again.


The first alert was felt in 15 minutes but remained at this intensity for the next hour until a second wave seemed to hit and I felt pretty good. Urinary retention, gurning and dehydration were noticeable.

180mg 6-APB and then when I had *just* started to come off the peak (5 hours after dosing, 3 hrs after the "roll" began) I took the 4-aco-dmt.  I usually take pretty hefty doses of 4-aco since I'm so used to its effects.  For me it was 60-80mg 4-aco insufflated.  


Basically I entered a state for a couple hours where I could ONLY function in the present moment.  I couldn't think about the past or future, I couldn't plan or evaluate or judge anything -  I could only just be.  


Only way I can describe it is I was fully "enlightened" and pretty much became a buddha for about 2 hours. ![:-)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) 

I was very clear-headed and lucid during the experience - happy and focused as a laser beam. 

I reached that exact same state four times in a row with about a month in-between doses of 4-aco.

After my incredible 50 mg mega-roll I am thinking of upping the ante to 75 mg (for security's sake) for a warehouse event next month featuring the most popular and esteemed act in psychedelic electronic music.  Wondering/hoping it will be sufficient or if I should bring more?  I hate having things on my person.

Has anyone dosed with Dramamine or Bonine anti-nausea?  I think it's psychosomatic in my case but I genuinely fear and feel anxious about the mere possibility of comeup nausea/vomiting.

I know everyone reacts differently, but I have had 200mg doses several times without tolerance and felt mildly nauseous for not even a minute. If you're taking 75mg as was mentioned previously, I think the chances of vomiting are small, but if you're prone to vomiting on drugs in general (I get diarrhoea if I don't smoke weed) then maybe this would be no exception. It might be a good idea to post it as a separate thread. I got many responses with suggestions for my problem when I did that. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Planning 75 mg for a warehouse rave/art show thing tomorrow.  Second experience.  


I feel like such a dummy for not stockpiling pre-ban. Doesn't seem there is anything comparable out there.

It's interesting to note how you've come to enjoy the substance. Early on you had bad experiences. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I'm under the impression that the vast majority of material that's going around is actually 6-APDB, especially considering how people seem to be reporting intense experiences from lower doses under the 100mg level

Thanks for the tip re: nausea, I intend to have a small meal ~2 hours prior and dose 2 x 50 mg maybe an hour apart.  I have Pepcid Complete and intend to take meclizine (Bonine/nondrowsy Dramamine) and have a couple Red Bulls for added push - unless the 4-FA I have on the way happens to come today.  Really hope I won't be overwhelmed by 100mg at 54 kg/120 lb, I'll be at a warehouse event and looking to dance.


My first/only 6-APB experience (pre-ban batch but who knows) was 50 mg but I had also had maybe 100 mg of untested "molly" (shameful and not safe, I know) a couple hours prior to dosing 6-APB that did not seem to have much effect.  I had maybe threshold effects from that, and it was only about 1.5 hrs after dosing the 50 mg 6-APB that I "came up."  


I took 40 mg 6-APDB to GREAT disappointment (maybe that's what you were thinking of , Just A Guy) - barely threshold and I became exhausted and felt ill only 5-6 hours after dosing.


As far as finding 6-APB nowadays goes I don't trust anyone - lots of bunk, methylone, and horsefeathers going around.

Dosage suggestions?  My tolerance to MDMA is such that 100 mg is perfect, strong effects but not too much.  70 mg a good place to start?  Are undershots boring and/or annoying with this compound?  100 mg a likely good dosage?


Combos:

Anyone tried the mix with 4fa or 2fma?  suggested dosages?

IME 100-125mg is a good place to start, then move up to 150mg if you feel comfortable and want to take it up a level. 200mg is my preferred dose, but this might be overwhelming if one's preferred MDMA dose is 100mg. 70mg might leave one underwhelmed, but it's better to under-dose for the first time, right? Saying that, I think it's unlikely to have a bad experience from 100-125mg. IME, redosing is very ineffective. This is my experience, take what you want from it. YMMV, of course.

Yeah, I've seen a lot on posts by people here who experienced bad comedowns and side effects.  It seems half were from single/first uses and the other half were from a cultivation of years of abuse of MDMA/stimulants.

Will be dropping a hefty dose of this at ASOT 650. Super excited :D 


I have a question for those of you with long rolls on this stuff. I have done 6 apb twice now and after 4 hours the effects just drop off while others are rolling for a good 6-8 hours.

Could this have to do with tolerance to mdma? And how much does redosing work with 6apb (the reports i have read are very conflicting)

I don't think it's 5-apb, 5-mapb or 6-mapb. 5-apb is about the same potency, looks/tastes/smells the same and the effects/duration are very similar. 5-mapb looks and feels different enough from 6-apb that it would be kinda obvious. Same goes for 6-mapb + 6-mapb is the most expensive one atm.


6-apdb? It's kinda like 6-apb (reports are very inconsistent regarding the exact effects) so I guess it could be that. Or maybe just impure 6-apb? No real way to say for sure without a lab test.

6-APDB on left, 6-APB on right

Both the same consistency - very sticky like slightly damp flour (was wrong about chalky, my bad), a lot of it has to be scraped from the sides of the bag and definitely won't settle like yours.


Unfortunately I have a massively diminished sense of smell and store my stuff with very strong scented chocolate stuff but with a strong enough whiff, the 6-APBD isn't so strong and 'gaggy'


If only there were a cheap way to distinguish the two...


EDIT: NVM pic won't load, I shall return

For below, sounds more like 6-APBD. It's by far not as stimmy as the 6-APB

Is the 5/6apb combo stronger than 6apb alone?  Last time i used 6apb i started with 210mg which turned out to be the sweetspot for full effects. Im now in possession of both and im thinking 125mg 6apb with 75mg 5apb should do the trick.


Or should i dose lower on the combo?

Yeah and i only used it 3 times. 140mg underwhelming, 175mg pretty good, 210mg finally i get what everybody is talking about. Natural tolerance i guess.


Though i have seen many posts on different forums saying 200-250mg is the sweetspot and others roll balls of 125mg. So i guess it varies alot.

Don't know if it's individual tolerance or stronger vs weaker batches.


My next time will be from a different source, but even if it is stronger 200mg total shouldn't be overwhelming for me.

I can drop a whole 200mg MDMA pill and have a great roll without it ever being too much. No comedowns either.

>6-apdb vs 6-apb

The reports are all over the place, for me 6-apdb lasts less and has a lower dose (about 30% for both) than 6-apb. The effects are similar, with 6-apb being a bit more enjoyable.

But like I said reports are all over the place, with some people claiming the opposite...


>Is the 5/6apb combo stronger than 6apb alone?

Not really, 5-apb is a bit more potent than 6-apb (if you have 5-apb hcl and 6-apb succinate which are the most common), but the difference isn't huge. I'd take the same amount in mg except half of each (but some prefer more 6-apb or more 5-apb).

I have a old succinate batch that looks like that, it has been bleached. Normally its tan/brownish


If its the .hcl version its about 10% more potent and will kick in faster.

I'm the same and I've had two different batches. One that looked like pancake mix and another that was the same consistency but white instead of tan. Both were stinky. Both I needed 200mgs to get "desired" effects. Though I don't find the experience to be particularly desirable. There are moments when it is indistinguishable from MDMA but those moments are so fleeting and the rest of the experience is very dirty in my opinion.

The shits, long dirty come-up, nausea..All the reasons I really cannot enjoy the experience really. Plus the killer headache at the tail end, no matter how much I drink or what I supplement with.  

Well combining it with MDMA would probably fix the experience in my opinion as well lol.

Generally I look to things like 6-APB though when I don't have MDMA/MDA, so I wouldn't ever think to  combine the two if I had both.

I'm down to 65 mg of an old batch.  How can I stretch it to get my money's worth, so to speak? I have 6-APDB, 2-FMA, 4-FA, 5-MAPB, LSZ, AL-LAD, tryptamines...

Will you take it in a party setting? What is your normal dosage with 6-apb? I would add 6-apdb and combine it into your normal dose.

I've heard it makes it so much better. Will have to try it myself though.


You can add some 2-fma for energy, but wait till you peak so you know if you need any.

Is 65mg enough for you to consider it at least a low dose? In that case LSZ + 6-apb would be what I would do.

Took 160mg of 6-APB (or whatever the hell this batch actually is) at a fest this past weekend. The roll was shorter than I remember but most importantly the comeup was a bit too intense and/or dirty for me. Mostly because I was in a very packed part of the crowd at a show and I needed some space.


The next time I plan on taking this stuff will also be at a fest. I'm thinking of adding some 4-FA to make it more stimulating. Recommended doses of each?

6-APDB stings like hell when snorted. Not worth it. Also I assume it's less cost effective due to reduced bioavailability.

For anyone wondering, 100mg 4-FA + 100mg 6-APB (which maybe isn't 6-APB? or at least a less potent version) was perfect. I felt like I was rolling on quality MDMA -- pretty easy & short comeup, and the 4-FA added some necessary stimulating to the usually sedating 6-APB. The whole experience lasted about 5 hours.

The next morning wasn't bad, either. I felt like I was lacking a bit of energy and motivation, but eating, smoking some weed and hanging out in the shade (instead of dancing in the sun) made me feel a lot better within a few hours.

If my preferred dose MDMA is around 180-250mg (Not at once, mostly 160-200 starting dose and another 30-50mg later) what would be a good 6-APB dose? I have 140mg, I was thinking a bit less like 110-130mg.


6'4" and around 235lbs (1.93m and 108kg) if that matters.

Hr would say try a lower one first just in case, if you're not going to...


~50-60mg 5-apb + ~50-60mg 6-apb would be my first choice


your suggesting second


But just so you know... 6-APB is closer to MDA than MDMA in effects.

I am aware of 6-apb's effect, I've just seen so many different doses in people. I know it has to do with tolerance, setting etc but the differences are still pretty massive. Some people finding 70mg overwhelming and some find 150mg barely enough.

That's why HR would say start low, lol ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


Otherwise I don't personally know anyone that was either overwhelmed or underwhelmed in the 100mg neighborhood. Of course my personal anecdotes != scientific evidence ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Online data like [http://tripbot.tripsit.me/factsheet/6-APB](http://tripbot.tripsit.me/factsheet/6-APB) also has doses around 100mg as ok. Not that either is a guarantee it'll be good for you.


Why some found 200 mg not enough.... could be bad batches, a lot were, especially in the beginning, could be huge tolerance to similar drugs, could have been cut, ....

Every time I ate a branded pellet(back when they first hit the market) I would get very nauseous during the come up,puke once and then be high for hours. I loved the effects but having to yakk in the bushes does put a damper on things.


After taking a year off,I tried the powered version,which I plugged. No nausea.

Tomorrow will be my first time rolling on the 5apb + 6apb combo. Dosage is 100mg 6apb with 80mg 5apb. (usual MDMA dose 200-220mg)


My friend who has a lower tolerance and never used an apb before will only take 135mg 6apb (usual MDMA dose 150-160mg)


I can't wait!

My friend had a great roll though and plenty of energy. But it lasted only 4 hours.

6apb in februari, MDMA in march, 4fa in may and again in june. 2cb in june aswell. But that shouldn't have shot up my tolerance that much. 

To be honest my first 6apb experience was lacking too. It didn't really get fun untill i went over 200mg and even though it was great i had zero energy from it. I just stood at the party with my eyes closed listning to the music (which sounded amazing)


Im thinking about trying Methylone on my next roll. Im saving my mdma for october.

I might try 5-mapb, but that will probably fuck up my MDMA tolerance and im reading alot about bad comedowns.


I still have plenty 6apb left so i might just wait a couple months and drop 250mg at once.

Yeah it probably is. Im not getting anything im hearing on the forums.

I also have some 6apDb but i want to try it at home first because i hear it has even less energy.


Is it true that 6apDb has less of a comedown and is less of a releaser than 6apb?

^^ Negative.


6-apdb and 6-apb are very similar in effect, and in my experience, 6-apdb was more stimulating and psychoactive than 6-apb.


Again, very similar.

I think I took around 100mg of 4-FA and 120mg of 6-APB. Or maybe a bit more of 6-APB, this was a couple of months ago so it's hard to remember. But the batch of 6-APB I have is less potent or maybe even a different APB, as it feels different from previous batches and I have to take more to get similar effects. 


&I actually put them both in one capsule so they were dosed at the same time.

Same sticky, flour-like consistency. And I believe about the same color. But missing the intense smell of previous batches; a smell so intense that it required me to wear a bandana over my mouth and nose while weighing it out.

china stopped making the stuff because it was difficult and expensive (rumours have it someone fell into a vat too but i'll just leave you with the actual facts...) and found that the other apbs were easier and cheaper. A UK ban came about killing most of the revenue and so exploration into a-pvp type stims started


I'd be very shocked if people still took the stuff regularly, I stocked up big time and only have a little left now

The last time I got 6-APB, which was probably two years ago at this point, it didn't feel like 6-APB. So I think it's been dried up for a while. I miss it though! I think I liked it a little more than MDMA.

As far as i know i think there are 2 batches of 6 apb out right now. 

Both are the succinate version which of course is less potent that the hci. 

I have seen the hci form available but i think its probably a typo. Apparently the hci synth is very very ifficult especially when you are trying to make kilos of it. 

This seems to be maming a comeback which is a good thing, its a safe non neurotoxic version of mda, mdma. I actually thought it was banned in the usa along time ago, because it basically dissapeared after the uk ban. But now it's very easy to find and pretty cheap. 

I havnt tried it yet cuz my vendor is on vaycay. But i do have a Gram of 5 apb to mix I with it (i jave heard thats the best way to do it.

Just got a new batch of 6-APB, I hadn't had any in a couple years. Pretty awesome stuff. I mix 150mg of 6-APB with 50mg of 2-FMA and it's great. I remember previously that 6-APB on its own was lacking in energy, it'd leave me feeling good but kinda lazy/just wanting to chill out. Adding a bit of 2-FMA in there does the trick. One thing I hadn't remembered about this stuff is how LONG it lasts. It starts kicking in for me after about 40 mins, and the next hour or 2 are almost overwhelmingly good, then that overwhelmed feeling disappears but the peak's still there and will last about 6 hours. The come down is very gradual, and even at +10 hours I'm still feeling the effects pretty decently. Not as loved up and euphoric as MDMA but the body high's really similar, as is the desire to have a deep conversation and actually listen to another person's perspective. My fiancee and I spent the entire night just talking, she asked me stuff like "Tell me about your time in Europe" and I went through the details of each country I visited, which took like an hour I'm pretty sure. That type of thing reminds me of MDMA, really nice!


Oh also, at 150mg I don't really notice any psychedelic effects. The only thing I got was at the very end of the experience, when I closed my eyes to try to sleep I was getting some strange CEV's. In the past, I had made the mistake of re-dosing this stuff at 200mg a cap. 400mg of this stuff gets very trippy, but not in a way that was enjoyable at all. After that experience, I never re-dosed this stuff again.

has anyone ever tried to combine 6-apb and mdma to emulate the reputed synergy between mdma and mda? just wondering because it would seem a logical thing with mda being so scarece, but i've never read about anyone trying it out...

I would make sure I have over 24 hours cleared up on my schedule from when I take it to when I would be expected to go  back to normal human type activities ie work and such..

You may not be rolling for 12 hours but you wont be back to normal in 12 hours.

125mg. It may be more 10-12 hours, I'm having a hard time remembering, but the residual stimulation is a bitch.

Yeah still seem to be some legit (spanish?) RC vendors selling this stuff in quantity. No idea on the quality of it though. I decided to bite the bullet and order a couple grams. See if it gets through customs.


Anyone have any idea if the current (succinate) batch is any good? Me and the woman were thinking of dosing 150mg and seeing where that took us?


I'm also surprised at how often I read that this stuff has almost no tolerance or magic loss compared to MDMA.


Many posts saying they lost MDMA magic but 6-APB brings it right back. And people saying even doing it subsequent weekends and it felt just as magical. Unreal.


Plus a 6+ hour roll as compared to like 3? Sign me up!


I spoke to borax and was thinking of adding 2-2.5mg of 5-meo-mipt at some point. borax seemed to indicate from his MDMA-made-from-rc info that it targets a receptor that MDMA does and these RCs don't. (I will of course try 6-APB on its own the first time). Might make it a nicer experience. He said it just might lack quite the lovey empathy as it doesn't release seratonin as hard, but still a more stimulating MDMA that lasts longer but a bit less lovey wouldn't be so bad.


Anyways, super excited I'll report back once I get/try it.

I'm so excited to see that apparently this chem is making a comeback. 


I haven't ordered it in a couple of years, but the last two batches I got were either very weak or perhaps a related chemical. 


I miss the magic of taking 80-90mg and rolling balls for like 5-6 hours!

Most of the succinate stuff out now seems to have a nice medium starting dose of 150mg. 


80-90 is prob a good dose for the HCL version which is no longer made it seems. Taking this with a grain of salt of course I've never done it myself just from reading. Like I said I'll report back once/if I get it. See what customs does.

Ah, good to know thanks! I'm willing to take more if I can get those same great effects.


Did anyone ever get very floury batches with an intense smell? I remember weighing it out with a bandana over my face. Good times.

It came in the mail at least!


It is a light tan very fine powder with not much or no real smell. 


Curious about the potency. I'm going to email again to verify that it is the succinate powder.


EDIT:Confirmed Succinate. Looks like 150mg will be the proper research dosage.

No smell? Huh, every batch of 6-APB I ever got had a strong chemical smell... You may want to start much lower if you don't have a testing kit, just to be on the safe side. 


I do remember it being light tan and extremely fine, though. Snorting it was impossible since it went straight to the lungs!

I mean it had a tiny bit of smell. But nothing like what I've read where it smelled so bad you had to hold your breath while dosing.


I'm waiting for the clonazolams to come in the mail so I can get to sleep so prob try this next week


Won't be snorting any entactogen. Every single one I've ever seen is just objectively worse than oral ROA.

I've seen this before for sure. The most common seems to be 6-APB and 5-APB mixed to create something a bit closer.


Other than the borax combo, the few times I've seen people mix 6-APB and 5-APB, with 2mg of Moxy for some added 'magic' seemed to be the closest to a neurotoxin free long lasting MDMA.


I'm going to have to order some myself I think and try it. Haven't even tried my 6-APB yet though so excited to try it on its own.

5-APB has the same action


it has even abolished mild HPPD after a big weekend of MD


subsequent DAYS are fine, however, there seems to be a metabolite based hypothermic effect after a long (24+ hours) multiple low redose journey -- and yes redosing brings back the peak

Be careful with the 6-APB


It can sneak up and slap you silly 2-3 hours after you THINK you are done, and can take a LONG TIME [2-3 hours] to come up -- making you think a redose is needed because it's weak or cut


Ended up dosing 3-400 mg over the course of 3-4 hours by mistake and the ride lasted 27 hours until baseline

Thanks for the warning. Ya don't worry I'm not much of a casual drug user, when I do any I tend to read a lot (like all 5 big and dandy threads here:D) and yeah the 2+ hour comeup features fairly prominently.

6-APB was definitely psychedelic for me when I took around 150mg. But at the 75-80mg level, it felt almost exactly like MDMA, just longer lasting.


(This was of course with batches that were out years ago. Not sure about potency now)

isnt moxy dangerous in combination with amphetamines en serotonin releasers? I take pretty high doses of 6apb so i won't risk it until i read more reports ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

No. I see people throw about moxy maybe being an MAOI but there is no actual scientific evidence of it that I've ever found. I've also though it would be tough to find, found several people refuting it quite soundly.


In small doses it has no dangers with any seratonin releaser than I'm aware of. It is one of the drugs of choice recommended by Borax on reddit for his Borax combo. Not sure his qualifications but he seems very knowledgable and they basically look like him like a god in /r/researchchemicals


I've also read several reports of small amounts of moxy with the APBs to add some 'magic' and they seem positive.


I will only doing about 2.5mg which should be just over threshold level.

I did 2-4mg of 5-MeO-MiPT 1-2 hours before dosing 6-APB and MDMA and was fine. I felt nothing to suggest caution.

I should probably make an effort to add my experience with combining 5-meo-mipt to its big and dandy thread, because I've had 2 very unpleasant experiences after taking moxy and my prescription adderall. 


The first time i had a bad reaction I blamed on taking too much due to a lengthy come-up, although my fiancée felt fine and I didn't really consider that. The vasoconstriction was so bad that my penis was losing feeling, and i maybe should have gotten medical attention immediately because that's very very scary, but I didn't. Fortunately my penis was fine (thank god!). My hands and toes felt bloodless too, but because the dose was too high, I didn't really think about it. I was too distracted by throwing up and feeling like I had the flu for the next 12 hours.


The second time I took a smaller dose and didn't get sick, but once again the vasoconstriction was alarmingly severe. I was on a walk on a hot summer day and stopped being able to feel my feet (felt like I had 2 peg legs!), and I ended up walking home barefoot to make sure my shoes weren't cutting off circulation. This didn't really help, and I was getting freaked out for sure. After i got home, I had a beer (thinking a vasodilator might help) and laid down trying to slow my heart rate and relax. It got better, but I have numbness that won't go away on the tip of one of my big toes that I'm pretty sure is from that. Both times the only factor that gave me this bad response and not anyone else that took it (same batch) was that i was also on adderall. 


tl;dr


I think moxy is dangerous when taken with stimulants that affect your dopamine levels, but it's probably safe to take with 6-APB alone. Use caution, though.

If you're asking me, then I can't say for sure because it was a while ago. I am on a pretty high dosage of adderall (20mg/x4 daily) but have been for years and my tolerance is pretty high. Due to poor judgement and improper use of a milligram scale (should have diluted the moxy before weighing it) I can't say for sure how much I took that first time. The second time is also hard to say because it was so long ago, and again, I wasn't being smart while measuring doses. I probably aimed for 6-8mg, and same dosage of adderall. 


I never mixed 6-APB with 5-MeO-MiPT, but I did try mixing it with 5-APB (50/50) which resulted in a clumsy, strange high. I had a really bizarre habit of forgetting what I was saying in mid sentence. It was kind of funny and a little alarming at the same time, but mostly just embarrassing. Literally in the middle of a sentence like: "The quick brown fox jumped over the....um....shit, forgot what I was saying again 8)". It felt a lot like a really high dose of MDA.

I just (over)did some 6-apb with the wife this weekend. Friday noonish dosed 2.5mg 5-meo-mipt and 180 mg of 6-APB. Came up pretty good in about an hour and a half. Had a fairly euphoric time. Like 6 hours later redosed with another 150mg of 6-APB. Came back up almost as good as the first time. Way diff than MDMA in this regard.


Had an overall good time. Did a final redose of 150mg which was a mistake. Nothing super negative but just didnt provide much benefit. More side effects, mild increase in rollyness, and yesterday was a total write off. Inital dose at 1pm and final dose at 2am. At 5am took 0.5mg clonazolam and that killed the bad stuff pretty quick and we went to sleep. Next day,was so sluggish and sore I just ended up taking 0.5mg clonazolam 1 tramacet for headache,spent the morning blobbing in front of the TV. No depression like MDMA though which was nice. 


Basically napped and watched movies all day.


Today still feeling a hair tired but soreness is gone, headache is gone, and feeling generally upbeat. Overall would do again, without the last redose. 180 mg with 150ish mg redose after 5-6 hours would have been perfect.


Didn't get any sense of being sick or overwealmed from the addition of the moxy. Just a touch more MDMA like magic for the first half. Prob a touch more visuals at the end (general mild visuals, moving, breathing. But very mild.)

I assume you mean 700 milligrams... I would like to warn people that this is not a safe dose. Maybe what you had was impure or a different compound. ~120mg x2 nearly killed me


Redosing after the first roll to try and bring it back led to severe vasoconstriction and mushroom type visuals. Would not do it again, I felt very unsafe squirming around as the drug took ahold of me with a fierce death grip (presumably from the 5ht2b agonism) 


Be careful with this one people. Do not try and redose, This is more suited for a one time thing. Taking more will only lead to a bad time. Learn from me ☮

It probably depends on the person. 700 mg is WAY too high but I honestly think a single redose worked well for both me and the wife. We got some vasoconstriction but nothing crazy. Even after a second redose, during the beginning of the comedown we were able to have sex. No dusky fingers or toes. Less trouble urinating than MDMA. Gurning similar to MDMA.


The first dose then redose really brought the roll back on, and seemed to have limited side effects for us.


No idea on purity. It is a VERY fine tan powder, smell not too strong. Tasted pretty bad. Came from spain somewhere (can't list sources on here right?). So maybe that batch not super strong.

Anethema, I guess I am looking at the same stuff. I didn't try it yet (or any 6-APB for that matter), but I will report back when I do. So if it really is so much stronger than the other batches that have been going around, what would be a reasonable starting dose? Somewhere around 100mg or maybe even a bit lower?

How safe is this one in regards to carcinogenicity and cardiotoxicity? Epoxide metabolites of benzofurans are [no joke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aflatoxin_B1), and this compound also is a *full* agonist of 5ht2b with a ki value of fucking 6, surely that spells disaster with any regular use? I've done 6-apb twice and 5-mapb twice, and I don't think they're worth the health risks when compared to mdma.

150mg oral dose could still be felt 16 hours after ingestion. w/ minimal side effects, occasionally I could feel my heart pounding, but I didn't get any chest pain which was strange because that is something I struggle with frequently. No nystagmus. Some sweating, and increased talkativeness.   


Subtle OEVs were noticed. It took a really long time to kick in, I'd say 2 hours at least

There's no tolerance between the two. If you're going to be using these chemicals you need to do a LOT more research if you're having to ask about cross tolerance between them.

Hi, does anyone have experience with Marquis reagent tests of this compound? from the other thread with the reagent tests my 6-APB should have turned brown but instead I got a purple reaction similar to MDA:

Hi All,


from searching again I found that this is the reaction I am looking for. Is there any experts on here who disagree?

As Xorkoth has said in another thread... MDA is a heavy drug, and 6-APB is no different. I can report my findings. 


After a heavy test this weekend I realized that this is very stimulating. Do not under estimate this drug. I couldn't go to sleep for over 24 hours. I was over stimulated from it. I rolled for a really long time and eventually got tired of it and wanted it to end.

This is probably cardio toxic. I had a really bad headache the next day with sharp pain. The experience was pleasurable but it is not something I wish to repeat because of the physical side effects. Next time I will do less, and wait longer in between rolls. 


Combined with some weed it led to some of the most amazing music enhancement I've had from a roll in recent memory. It left my body feeling heavily fatigued and stressed. Slept for 13 hours once the stimulation wore off the day after. I have a severe headache as I type this.    


I highly recommend the weed combination to potentiate it.


My dose was probably around 170mg rectally 


I can't be certain but it was for sure less than <200mg

Yeah I know. I got carried away. I think I could've benefited from having some benzos on hand to mitigate the heavy stimulation.


I don't recommend this to anyone, I think I'm lucky to be alive right now. One week later and much more recovery time is still needed.

So if it really is so much stronger than the other batches that have been going around, what would be a reasonable starting dose? Somewhere around 100mg or maybe even a bit lower?

It's definitely pretty potent. I started at around 100mg, after an allergy test, and for me that was about the right place of being clearly active but not overwhelming. The first time I just took it orally and that didn't agree with me at all because the side effects, i.e. nausea, headaches, sweating and jaw clenching, seemed to overpower the positive effects. Although a less than ideal state of mind before dosing might have also played a role in that. I went on to try plugging it (at 90mg) and that made almost all the side effects disappear. A little bit of sweating and jaw tension is always to be expected with these kind of drugs I guess. I was left with a relaxed and dreamy empathogenic high that I enjoyed very much. Not psychedelic at all though, at least at this dose. In fact I ended up taking around 12mg of 4-AcO-DMT to add a little more depth to it, which worked out nicely.

100mg seems like the perfect dose for most people, except for the people that carry a little more weight and need more to get the normal effects of the RC.  I personally have never dosed 100mg and being a user for more than 20 times, I don't have the urge to get to that amount, although it would be nice every once every now and then, I am contempt with the threshold doses.   So each time I would dose, the dose amount would either be 20mg - 30mg per session and maybe a redose for about the same amount a few hours later.  But I would do this for about two to three times per week instead of once or twice a month.  Is there anybody out there that takes small doses or have any knowledge that taking small amounts but taking it more frequently won't hurt you as much as taking normal doses? I understand that you should treating 6APB as an MDA, but does someone out there have the knowledge or information to let me know if taking small amounts frequently is something that can be done and won't harm you, or does it actually harm you more because you are taking it more frequently. Thanks to anyone that has information about this.

I've had bad and dysphoric experiences with low doses in the 50 mg range. It basically just feels like a 5 hr come up. I I found that I need a high enough dose to pass a threshold to have a true roll. Even 100mg isn't quit breaking that threshold though I get some good effects at 1100.

Man, I really wanna sniff some. I sniffed about 250 5-me earlier. Just about enough to have me stimmed and trolling craigslist. For what I dunno, it's just pros and trannies anymore. I think 6-apb would make it even more likelier I would fuck a non passable tranny. ... buuuuut I want to do some. lol.


I'll prolly not do any. I just took 2 mg Etiz, downed a beer, and am hopeing this lil pinner joint puts me in the mood to watch cartoons. Fuck yeah for being able to legally (at least as far as the rest of the people in my state) smoke weed for the first time in five years. I even stepped on my joints toni9ght for a concert. Wasted the first one b/c it was wayyyy to compact to smoke. Walking out of the club like "you got a bowl I got some green" and a dude motion me over. Turned out we have the same name. He saved my ass. One of my fave metal bands and I was really looking forward to smoking. I gave him my green and he got me high off his bowl. Twas nice.

This stuff makes me wank like no others drug... but at a too high level.

It's strange that i's stoning and at the same time it give a trailing amphetamine high like..

I feel like it has too much impact on serotonin and not enough on other neurotransmitter...

I have quite little experience with empathogens, 4 rolls. But a couple weeks ago I decided to order me some 6 APB, tried 70 mg (just to get a feel for it) 2 weeks ago but I didn't really feel anything, that's when I realised it must've been succinate.

For tonight I have prepared 140mg, I guess this is an OK starting dosage? Anything I should know beforehand? I know the come up can be quite uncomfortable.. But I'm really looking forward to it nonetheless ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

IME, 150mg is where it's at. 6-apb is one of those substances where you have to achieve a 'breakthrough' dose to appreciate it - anything less than that is disappointing. I've never felt the come up to be uncomfortable in the slightest but I suppose it depends upon your setting. It can be quite overwhelming, but you need to be able to relax into it. I personally would prefer 6-apb over modern MehDMA any day of the week. 


Proper MDMA is superior, but only by a margin...

The come up is very smooth for me. What is slightly annoying is at about the 10 hour mark, I feel just stimulated but nothing else and I am wanting to sleep at that point but it is a few more hours before that can happen. My experience is with HCl.

I actually didn't feel that much, I partied really hard tho, but most of the effects were physical, with a very slight headspace. It was a killer party anyway, had soo much fun.


Next time I will try 200mg, not being able to pee kind of sucked as I drank liters of water :D, maybe I have a weak batch or something.


If I didn't roll hard, should I still wait a couple of months before trying it again?

HCL I think, though I can't be certain. Was always a very light tan coloured very fine powder, if that's anything to go by...

OK thanks. What I have is sold as the succinate. It looks exactly like what you have described. And a strong smell. I was thinking of maybe taking 150 to 170mg. I want strong effects hopefully this dose will do. 

If I may ask when was your last research with 6-apb?

Personally I have taken up to 180mg of 6-APB and while it was quite pleasurable and fun, it didn't hold a candle to proper MDMA MDA or even methylone or several other cathinones, or 4-FA even.  For me, 6-APB never gets chatty, it never gets lovey, it's just an intense body high, heavy nystagmus, and a heavy/lazy feeling.  And it feels quite taxing, too.  I found 5-MAPB more MDMA-like although it's not as good either, but it feels lighter and less intoxicating/more sociable.

That's interesting. So many different opinions on this chemical.  Proper mdma/mda doesn't do much for me any more. Only back in the 90s and early 2000s did I really enjoy mdma. I think I'll at least try 6-apb and see what it's like. Those first experiences always seem to be nice. Just don't won't to under dose. Would be nice if people would post which salt and what mg they were dosing for more accurate information.

You're right, I wouldn't class 6-apb as sociable at all. But it's perfect for getting mashed on your own...

6 apb is very chatty for me. Not a party material though as it doesn't have a strong uplighting energy to it. I think it would be great for couples therapy. The comedown feels much nicer on the body compared to mdma.

@Fubar- I find it interesting that you talk about 6-apb as an "all or nothing" substance, which I've always found MDMA/MDA to be like.

Went really hard on 200mg succinate tonight, wouldn't go for any less if you have the succinate version.


Great great fun though ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

6-apb to me was fine for socializing.  First time I took it was in a city going to night venues, actually got a picture of me and two cute girls from that night.


max dose ive done was 90 mgs.  even 70 mgs was enough


I mixed 90 mgs with 7 mgs of a 4 sub typtamine 4-ho-mipt, and didnt have a good time.  Had erectile dysfunction the whole week after and was very emotional the whole week.   That said, I was going through a lot emotionally, and this amplified emotions.     In addition i rolled three times earlier that year , 2017, and for me at my age and my experience, thats too much. Not a fan of mixing this was a sub 4 typtamine.


would possibly be interested in trying a higher dose like maybe 100 or 110, or 120, since I have done 90 mgs.  maybe not though. or maybe a redose .

I just read on [Psychonaut Wiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/6-APB) that 6-APB appeared as both hydrochloride, succinate and fumarate salts. Is that true? I thought that it always had been sold as succinate salt. Why should that be the case, actually - has this salt with an organic acid any advantages over the hydrochloride? Also, 5-APB first appeared as succinate and later on as hydrochlorid, wich was advertised as a step forward, because the hydrochlorid acid is lighter than the succinate acid, and therefore, a smaller dose was necessary.


Finally, I just checked the CAS number on my old 6-APB, and it was the one of 6-APB HCl. This could of course mean that it is in fact 6-APB HCl, but also that it is in fact 6-APB succinate (as I thought it was when I bought it), and only the CAS number of the Hydrochlorid came in handy to the supplier.

It could be that this one will become quite rare if the NL bans go through, just saying.


I read on reddit that current batches are quite a bit more potent than previous, even though it's still succinate salt. About 180mg was my sweet spot, but people are now saying it's way too much so watch out, a good dose would be more around 130mg or so.

I can confirm this. 140mg was strong and comparable to 180-200mg from previous succinate batches.

The disparity in potency is quite dangerous, but confirmed my suspicion that batches from the last two years just weren't very pure.

The bans are not 100%, but it seems quite likely, but it's still unsure when it will all go into effect. Benzofurans, and their precursors are on the list at least

That being said, anecdotes seem to align with the .6 (this was actually lab tested by one of the big rc vendors). If i were to do it on its own id probably  start with 200-240

You all that need high doses must either have one weak batches or two need to take a long break


I'm not advising people take long breaks as I although it very well may be best to. If one has a good batch and hasn't done it in a couple years it is best to even go lower than you have before because it definitely was stronger


Same batched since 2017 last time I used this was 2019 over 2 years ago. Highest went was 90 mgs. Last time I use anything similar was  4 ho mipt and two hours later 5 Mapb, kind of a hippie flip ,so to speak ,about a year and a half ago


Did one capsule at 75 mg and the plan was to take a 30 mg booster. After two, three, five  hours it was still quite intensely strong so did not take the booster

I also had a 6-APB succinate sample lab-tested (which I bought at the end of 2019 from a well-known Dutch vendor) that turned out to be pretty strong. Luckily, I started with a low-dose of 120mg (which was enough for me), compared to the usual 180-200mg doses.


Result was calculated as the HCl salt, because the testing facility uses that form as their referance material:

expected: 572.28mg/g 6-APB HCl

unexpected: 109.88mg/g 5-APB HCl


If you take into account that the 6-APB succinate salt is around 40% less potent, the result for the succinate would be as follows (if I did the math correctly):

expected: 801.19mg/g 6-APB Succinate

unexpected: 153.83mg/g 5-APB Succinate


Qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed by ChEckiT through UHPLC-DAD-MS.


Oddly enough, all the 6-APB samples analyzed by ChEckiT over the last couple of years contained 5-APB as byproduct! It's bad that the 6-APB was contaminated but the strong synergy of the two benzofurans is pretty damn enjoyable regardless and it makes me wonder if the other batches going around also contain 5-APB, considering not one of the samples tested by ChEckiT contained solely 6-APB.

Interesting! Is this common knowledge? It's quite a bit...


I personally didn't like specifically adding 5-APB to 6-APB, at the time I thought 6-APB on its own was much better

No ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif) , it's quite a bit of 5-APB. I had no idea 5-APB was a byproduct of 6-APB synths

Oh, sorry. :D Yes, it's quite a bit of 5-APB and I had no idea that it's commonly present in 6-APB samples. At first I thought the 5-APB might actually be 4-APB and that they coudn't differentiate between different isomers, but they told me that both 4- and 5-APB were in their database… So it still remains a mystery.

There were a lot of older batches going around that apparently contained large amounts of 4-APB and succinic acid left over from synthesis which reduced the quality tremendously. It would make sense why they would seek out a new synthesis route that would produce the active (and desirable) 5-APB instead of 4-APB, but my chemistry knowledge ends here, so I don't know how or if they even changed their production methods.

I have an analysis report on 6-apb succinate from a NL vendor (guy that smokes). Any idea how I should dose this? I hear that there are both strong and weak batches going around. I was thinking doing it around 150-200mg


Here is the report and a picture of my 6-apb:

A rule of thumb with any new batch is to start small at a very small dose because you don't know exactly what it is even if it does test good on Marquis test


even then it's best to start on the smaller dose of normal after the first small test

You definitely have succinate. And im fairly certain all the main NL vendors are getting it from the same lab, it is said that a vendor that does not carry it got it tested and it came back as around 60% purity (that same vendor is seeing if they can refine the product). I would personally do 200mg, but safety and harm reduction and all that.

No please don't do 200mg, new batches are véry potent. 140mg had me and my friend rolling very hard for 10 hours before it came down somewhat. [@Blekksprut](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/543717/) 

200mg and we'd have been floored and puking for hours. Older batches probably had more impurities and 180-200mg was my standard dose there.

You said it


My first roll was over 20 years ago. And I took a 13-year break. Since then the most I've done was four times in a year and that was too much for me. One maybe two times a year on entactogens


Last time I did 70 mg 6 APB was plenty and I was going to redose and I decided not to it was it was strong enough a few hours after dosing

Somewhat similar to MDMA, although it's not close enough that any experienced user would think it is MDMA. 

Slower come up and longer duration, less rushy, less impulse to redose compared to MDMA.

No strong comedown in the following days except for less energy and lower mood but much much less so than MDMA.


Would go great with LSD.


Can't remember exact dosage I took but it was close to 100mg.

However it is an analogue of illegal compounds and is therefore subject to legal scrutiny in countries like the US. To remind all of you of Bluelight's rules it is not allowed to discuss vendors, sources and prices.**

Methylone was nice in the fact it felt like an empathogen that could be used more often than others due to its lighter, dopamine heavy effects.  Perfect for a good local club night or something on that level.

I only tried 6-APB once before and I took 4-MMC with it because I heard it had a 2 hour come up. All I remember is having major couch lock and listening to music for hours.


I'm looking forward to sampling this again soon after well over a decade since those benzo fury pellets came out.


Has anyone tried combining 6-APB with 3-MMC yet? I was thinking about trying that combo after I try the 6-APB solo first. I bet a couple of bumps of 3-MMC would put a person right on a full dose of 6-APB.

Well the "official benzo fury" pellets were 100mg. That's my one and only experience with 6-APB so far.


I'm pretty sure those pellets were the HCL salt and not the salt currently in circulation so you may need to up the dose a few mg to get an equivalent dose of 6-APB base from the modern product.

It wasn't bad. I took like 70mg a few different occasions. Was just like a smooth roll. Pretty sure I redosed as well. 


I seem to have a hard head for empathogens from my MDMA use, so it was a little on the chill side I could've upped the dose more probably.

I think that's how the APB's are. Chill.


I'm not sure more will get you there like it will with MDMA or 4-MMC because APB's just don't have the same push.


I wonder how they are if you add some meth. I like to add meth to MDMA too. 4-MMC was just right by itself although I used to combo it with bk-MDMA a lot.


I got a free gram sample of both 5-APB and 5-MAPB when they came out and I did all of both grams in one night and I never felt there like you do with MDMA.

Jesus Christ lmao you did a g of 5apb and a g of 5mapb in ONE night?

I only did 5mapb like once or twice (in normal doses) but I do remember really liking it. Probably moreso than 6apb.

I think I overdid it on the first dose with 150mg of 5-APB and 150mg of 5-MAPB all at once.


See there weren't really any recommended dosage charts at the time and i assumed they would both be around the same potency as MDMA. So I took 300mg which is how much I was taking as a redose when I was rolling a lot last year.


I kept redosing both every few hours at that level trying to get an MDMA like buzz but it never came.


I was super high though. I think I pretty much sat still on the couch all night with headphones in listening to drum and bass and staring off into space.

After staying up all night snorting 3-MMC and 6-APB I no longer think of 6-APB as chill.


The combo has everything you could want from any mdxx type experience.

Also, for me at least, snorting 6-APB is a big win. 


The come up is almost instant and there is quite a big rush. Breathing will get fast. Then colors start to pop and things start getting different visually. Your whole body quickly becomes overtaken by mdxx like warmth.


I definitely preferred snorting 6-APB over my one previous oral dose.

Thinking of trying some 6-APB soon. What is a good first-time dose of the succinate formulation if I'll be going to a rave/party? I'd like to be stimulated and high but still somewhat functional, not looking for a dose that will floor me.

The problem with 6APB is that the purity wildly ranges esp with the succ version, so it depends where you got it, when you got it, but could range from like 40-60% purity. If I were you I would try and find reports from around the time your purchased and try and match up dosage that way. If you can find purity stats take your target mdma dose and divide it by that purity percentage. Don’t be surprised if you need to legitly go as high as around 250mg or even more

No one can say that confidently imo because those succinate batches vary drastically in terms of purity and byproducts. I had a succinate batch lab-tested a few years back that was extremely strong and contained a substantial amount of 5-APB as well. I only needed ~125-135mg for a heavy roll with that one while others report doses of up to 200mg or more and I can say with absolute certainty that such a dose would have me puke my guts out and would not be enjoyable anymore. A friend of mine took 150mg (in two doses) of that exact batch and gurned like I have never seen it before, it was almost scary lol. 


Many of the circulating 6-APB batches contain(ed) substantial amounts of succinic acid, 5-APB, and even moreso the inactive isomer 4-APB which hampered the quality quite a bit and made 6-APB unreliable in terms of dosing. I suggest starting with 125mg, that seems like a safe starting dose to me but there's a pretty good chance that this is too little for you.

My batch is 75% 6-APB, 11.5% 4-APB, and 13.5% succinic acid according to the retailer. I was going to start with 100mg. Do you think that this would be too little? My usual MDMA dose is 120mg of pure MDMA as I haven't used empathogens (other than 2C-B) often enough to develop a tolerance.

100mg will be good I think.


I don't actually like my more pure and recent 6-APB batch all that much. The one I had before where I had to take like 180mg+ was much better in effects.

Might be, but you can always redose if it‘s too little so 100mg sounds good to me. Just be aware that 6-APB‘s comeup can be long (up to two hours) so don‘t redose too early. 


I‘m sure you‘ll have a good time. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I actually found almost sub-perceptual doses of 6-APB to be great for parties as well. Easy to get into the flow, healthy energy and you forget all about it but afterwards you think "damn that was an amazing night", it did its part.

I did it quite a bit with my first and second batches, around 60mg. Don't know what that would be now because the dose response curve is not at all as linear as with the more potent succinate batch. All based on my own trials though so take that with a grain of salt.

So this makes me wonder if it would be a good adjunct substance to some MDxx.  My brother actually did 100mg with 100mg of MDMA and rolled pretty damn good but he’s in that magic lost category so I need to try.


The couple things he said was first he was without his normal Amphetamine prescription and was tired but the 6-APB woke him right up.  He also said after about 6hrs it dropped very suddenly which surprised me but MDA can do that too on the odd occasion.

It was not only me that said this, but also three friends on three separate occasions. Disappointing was the term (they had experience with the earlier batches). Enough time between the rolls too.


I don't entirely know what's off, there used to be some magic element, that golden glow, where everything just feels right. The other times it just felt more clinical, like you're getting steamrolled with dopamine and serotonin and that's it. It's still good, but for me it was thé drug that I reserved for thé perfect line ups. Now, not so much...


There's a pretty fucking sick line up tonight as well coincidentally, I'm still on the fence over what to do exactly drug wise.

Fuck it, I’ll take the 6-APB I’ve been sitting on next weekend too.  It’s been too long of me saying I would lol.


Now question is, how much with how much MDMA? Cuz I’m almost certainly going to mix it. (I honestly don’t know if I trust full doses of the APB’s, they feel safer to me in small doses mixed with other drugs.) I’m thinking 50mg with 120mg MDMA, then maybe a follow up booster of 25/25 each.

Come to think of it, I've actually tried MDMA + about 30mg of 5-APB (maybe 40, or even 50, don't remember), it added nothing good and the 5-APB/benzofuran feel might have even detracted from the experience. But 5-APB is also much worse than 6-APB so...

God damnit well just accidentally got myself an allergy dose, pissed cuz it’s so close to my plans I hope I didn’t inadvertently raise my tolerance or nothing.  Went to sniff the jar and I think I had just knocked it a couple times to get all of it to the bottom.  Soon as I did I felt a burn in my nostril and immediately knew I snorted something.


Tried blowing it out but it was in, even tasted some drip so musta been more than I care to imagine lol.


Definitely a headspace change akin to other empathogens at a low dose, obviously no pupil dilation, but my vision is noticeably altered.

6apb is kind of a bitch for reposing because it takes so long to come up. It’s actually one that you ideally want to nail on the first shot. If you are confident/comfortable in your mdma dosing then frankly I wouldn’t be so afraid to at least match the mg…that is still honestly being conservative

Yea my accidental dosing last night was both unexpected and unwanted which led to a great deal of anxiety for a few hours until mellowing out into a better feel.  Nothing like 5-MAPB where 5mg can be felt and is ok, this was rough but felt rough cuz I didn’t reach a proper dosage.

How would you say that 5-MAPB compares to 6-APB? I’ve heard that 6-APB is virtually identical to MDA while 5-MAPB is more sedating, less clear-headed and energetic, and similar to MDMA.

Can’t really say compared to 6-APB as I probably had 5-10mg at most up my nose, just enough to get a slight taste and to test the waters on low/micro dosing.  Found out it’s not like 5-MAPB at all in that regard.  (Which is strange cuz actually MDA ain’t bad at lower doses.)

Ah.. That I know ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


Good quality 5-MAPB is closer to MDMA.  It takes about 90-120min to fully come up and unlike MDMA it’s a slow gradual climb.  The comeup is marked with anxiety, inability to talk well, and vision blurriness.  All of which subside when the peak hits to a nice clean steady MDMA like experience.


My first roll with 5-MAPB was like my first roll all over again.  I dosed at like 8pm and was still up really good at 3-4am.  Full of energy dancing my heart out, the first time I ever actually said things to people I regretted later.  That good..  All from 90mg.


I’ve watched magical things happen on this drug.  Thing is not all batches are like the one I speak of, some have been lackluster comparatively.

I've heard that it can be a bit more sedating than MDMA. Doesn't sound at all like you experienced that effect though.


Is the fumarate batch going around these days any good? I have access to excellent quality MDMA so I'm hesitant to get an RC that will be "as good"/"almost as good". The increased cardiotoxicity caused by 5HT2B agonism doesn't help its case either.


I didn't use 6-APB at a rave, but it seems like my ideal rave drug based on my experience.

Na honestly I’ve never quite understood why people called it sedating.  Maybe if at home on the couch watching a movie yea, doesn’t have the same jaw gurning intensity but certainly still stimulates me.


I also love how on 5-MAPB I’m so smooth compared to MDMA.  If I was single I’d have no problem finding someone while on it.  Even as it comes down I find myself locked into that state of “relaxed with myself” for a long time.


I unfortunately don’t have any idea on the current state of 5-MAPB as the good batch I bought in 2014 and my most recent which I’m still testing a bit (but seems nearly as good so far) was 2020.


I’ll say this, the drug is VERY worth seeking out.  Even with the risk of shitty batches, when you get the good stuff it’s beautiful.


I’ve watched amazing things happen cuz of this drug, major therapeutic breakthroughs not capable with MDMA alone, complete lifestyle changes overnight (for the better), etc.


I should warn though it isn’t to be played with, as you said the increased cardiotoxicity from 5-ht2b.  My first few experiences were just 5-MAPB (90 and 80mg respectively) and I noticed strange heart issues in the week or so after each one plus some decent depression that hit like days 7-12 after the roll.


I now use it only as an adjunct to MDMA and havent had an inkling of heart issues since.  Plus they each cover the others weak spots, MDMA adds the intense peak while 5-MAPB some additional love, steadiness and duration.

The N-methylated benzofurans actually have a similar agonist activity at 5HT2B compared to MDMA. 5-APB and 6-APB on the other hand are very selective and have considerably higher affinities at that receptor.

No, they weren't, unfortunately.  Not enough participation, and I also rethought the design of the survey partway through.  I never ended up posting any results.  That's why I was excited about your idea though.  I still am, it's just a question of time and energy.

I though because 4-fa is a light releaser of serotonin and mostly dopamine that I'd be fine, but apparently amphetamine the days coming up to a roll can make it very weak. Guessing this is the case with 4-fa due to the chemical similarity.  [techzpod](https://techzpod.com/) [download mobdro](https://get-mobdrovip.com)

All 6-APB is produced by the same company, which makes legal LSD analogues. Unfortunately, they have never recaptured the process from Chinese masters of 2013. Current batches of 6-APB succinate are so weak that hardly anything beyond a mild amphetamine-like stimulation is felt at 100mg. In fact, it took the addition of 100mg and 5-MAPB hydrochloride to begin to roll, and another 50mg of 5-MAPB hydrochloride to have a decent roll. While it was good, it wasn't comparable to 80mg of 6-APB 70mg of 5-APB combination, which would keep one unable to hold back his grin back in 2013. But the side-effects 3 days down the road were very mild as well, though they no doubt were mediated by 3+1 days of Rave-Aid supplementation.  I am just wondering whether it is cost effective. Perhaps 200mg of 6-APB with 50mg of 5-MAPB will make a better sense, but that will have to wait for at least a month. Still, grabbing 5-MAPB, while it is still available makes sense as the current batch of that chemical is good.


I only wish that somebody was still producing 6-APDB which (when preceded by 300mg of Pramiracetam) was excellent for rolling on its own and was an incredible verbal-cognitive enhancer at 5mg insufflated.

[@Pastel](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/226156/) I found 100mg (+65mg 6-6.5 hours later) of 6-APB succinate to be excellent and it was the best roll of my life.


For reference, I normally need 110-120mg of 95%+ purity MDMA for a decent roll.


Maybe you have just lost some of the magic for some reason. Or maybe you got a bad batch. How often do you roll?

Used to be nearly every two weeks in 2013-2014 on good 6-APB/5-APB for about a year. Somehow without a loss of magic, which could not be said at the time about 5-ME, which while being even better, only worked twice for me after which I put it in storage, since it wasn't produced anymore. (And turned out to be easily degradable, even in a chilled, low oxygen container).

Since good 6-APB cl was gone circa 2015, and around which time I ended my RC hiatus and I went back to working full-time - once a year or less. 

BDO is my drug of choice for dancing and for me, it also outmatches any benzofuran/MDXX for empathy.  And just like benzofurans, it is semi-legal.

Anyone Microdosed this as in 10 xs less than dose you'd use, if you would normally roll. ?


Example a person normally takes 60-90 mgs , when they use 6 apb.  They could start at 6 mgs first time.   


Has anyone been on any antidepressants, and Microdosed 6 apb, while not taking antidepressants, and how would they compare?

That sounds like a very bad idea to me, considering how damaging MDMA microdosing can be.

I’ve microdosed MDMA and while it’s certainly not nearly as damaging as a standard dosing regimen you won’t get the benefits you seek.  Very quickly made me feel like shit, I wouldn’t do it.

I had a succinate batch lab-tested a few years back that was extremely strong and contained a substantial amount of 5-APB as well. I only needed ~125-135mg for a heavy roll with that one while others report doses of up to 200mg or more and I can say with absolute certainty that such a dose would have me puke my guts out and would not be enjoyable anymore. A friend of mine took 150mg (in two doses) of that exact batch and gurned like I have never seen it before, it was almost scary lol.

From what I have read 4-APB is unlikely to be inactive.

Yea long time easily over a decade, I only did it for 4-5 days before deciding it was very much not worth it.  I’ll be honest too, part of the reason I did it was cuz I spilled a bag in my pocket and was having a hard time just letting it go.  So every morning I was dabbing out of it lol, I know that makes it even better.

[@G_Chem](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/360545/) time schedule is where I'd dose 6 apb, 45 mgs, Five hours apart, traveling city to city.


Example four pm before a fitness event. Id do resistance exercise , so I would like only 35mgs .  If I hit it off with a cute girl and we end up in this city ,i don't think I'd re dose.and spend time in the city with her 


But if I finish the fitness event and I don't hangout with a cute girl, and yes I have one in mind, still never know as I know a couple girls at this fitness center. 


And if I don't stay in the city, Then I will drivee to a Bigger city about three hours away to meet up with a friend.  We'd go out downtown to night venues.  Right before going out to night venues, clubs, bars, I'd take maybe 45 mgs. I e been going through some depression and feeling a bit low more than normal. Used 5 mapb 20 mgs in Mid June

  Used 25 mgs Mal since then and last week used 27 mgs mal.  Been feeling very moody since.  Would this be a reason to not use any dose of 6 apb?

If you are really depressed then I have to caution you on taking any empathogens. 


I had two different friends in the past who attempted suicide after taking empathogens when they were already extremely depressed. 


One was very depressed and took mdma and ended up in the psych ward claiming to want to end himself and the other tried to overdose on pills after my friend talked her into trying mephedrone while she was extremely depressed. 


So for those two reasons I always caution people to avoid rolling if you're extremely depressed. To me it's like how could you be depressed if you are rolling but I know two people who each spent 72 hours in the psych ward for attempting suicide after or while rolling so not recommended. Thank goodness they both lived!

I wouldn't say depressed just more intense downs and some ups for lack of better words.    The only entacogens I e used in over a year time period was 5 mapb , 3 xs , at 20 mgs.   Before the did 65 mgs  6 apb in September in of 2021, and before that 70 mgs 6 apb in February 2021.   Still would like to go to another city and seek female companionship, of possible, preferably one that meets checklist but if not okay with short term encounter,  esp since in another city.

Current batches of 6-APB succinate are so weak that hardly anything beyond a mild amphetamine-like stimulation is felt at 100mg. In fact, it took the addition of 100mg and 5-MAPB hydrochloride to begin to roll, and another 50mg of 5-MAPB hydrochloride to have a decent roll. While it was good, it wasn't comparable to 80mg of 6-APB 70mg of 5-APB combination, which would keep one unable to hold back his grin back in 2013.

But sadly that shit is happening with all RCs, isn't it?

People says that of mostly everything, 4-mmc, 3-mmc, 2-fma recent batches (being crap), even NEP seems to be worse and worse. In some of those cases seems that the chinese guys were better doing it something that I don't really get (why? I cannot believe that Europe don't have good chemists or better infrastructure).

In some other cases it really seems that the chemists are pressured to find cheaper chemical routes and in some other cases it seems that once the precursors are too controlled the second route (with other precursors) seem to produce worse results...

I hate stupid war on drugs, is just so idiotic and makes no sense. It only harms the scene and the people inside.

I ve done 20 mgs  5 mapb oral and definitely felt entacogen rolling effects.


Off subject bit Mal Microdosed , 4 mgs,  was pleasant.

Yup.  Unlike MDMA the 5-MAPB can be dosed as low as 10mg and still get effects that don’t feel like a waste of the drug.  I wouldn’t do it often like people microdose psychedelics but it can be done.

Had a blast on 75 mgs 6 apb.  Socialized, then danced the night away.   One sexy chick came up to me to dance, with her man watching, we danced.

May have to experiment with a small 5 mapb taking first before 6 apb.  Everyone last night said I looked nervous or anxious.


  I have discontinued weed a couple days before and some chick, devil horns Halloween custome,  offered some banana pudding cannabis.  


Sure got a noradrenaline,na, effect the most it felt like, from 6 apb.   Been thirteen months since used this same batch, it's from 2017. It's stored in plastic so more than likely best stored in glass, never had an issue before but maybe best in glass?   . 


The na effects were high, it seemed.  Almost felt like deep vein bloodflow in legs.  Maybe was imagining.  Can't be too careful.  So going by this 75 mgs 6 apb almost seemed to high on norepinephrine and dopamine, one chick asked if I was on coke, so could be best to lower dose a bit and experiment with 5 mapb micro or low dosed.

Remember all of this is genetic if you have had naturally high dopamine at the time genetically where sometimes you talk super fast and you get anxious, you don't want to spike dopamine too high unless you want to do it for a specific purpose but for general going out you don't want to get it too high.  


Some of the challenges are finding which drugs best work for you at certain times in your life.  And they won't always work the same year after year sometimes your body changes and you have to adapt.

I agree, I have seen amazing things happen with 5-MAPB. Long ago I met this kid, we were both young but I was his senior. I hate to say it, but I was like 18 or so at the time and I think he was 15, maybe 16, but we hit it off right away. He was already into drugs, he was one of my adderall sources, but there was this immediate connection with each other. Unfortunately since then his life has taken a real dark turn for the worse, but I wont mention that here. But we no longer talk because of it, we later fell into bad meth addiction together, but we were like fucking brothers. I miss him dearly but he has decided to take a different route in life than I care to be associated with. Anyways, when we met there was an immediate connection. For his age he was insanely intelligent, very funny, and we got along well. So one day my GF at the time and her family left on a trip to CA and I was watching the house, so I invite him and a mutual friend over to sample some 5-MAPB. They had never rolled but we weren't really excited about the prospect of dosing, we were just happy to be together. I can't remember how much it took, but it was enough. We had a grand fucking night, one that I hold close to my heart but that also tears me up in some ways. During the peak he opened up to us. He told us that he had been abused as a child. Repeatedly by a very close family member. Very severe sexual abuse at a very young age, like from 2 years old and it went on for a few years, and he was still living with the family member and had to keep going on like nothing had happened, because at 15 your powerless in those types of situations. He told us that this had been his month. He was planning on killing himself within the next few weeks because he didn't know how to handle the abuse, but through this experience, he feels that he can live again. After the roll we parted ways, they went home and I stayed at my GF's. The next day he comes back over and tells me that he confronted his mother and his dad, his dad being the one he thought responsible for the abuse. His parents clarified that it was actually his older brother who was the abuser, his older brother who had killed himself years ago because he hated himself for what he had done. I told him how proud I was of him for confronting the issue head on, and that I was very happy that he no longer had to live with his abuser. The kid is still alive, though unfortunately he has struggled on and off with meth addiction and has been in and out of prison. I imagine before too long he will be in prison for many many years.


That was the first time that I witnessed in person the power of empathogens. I had witnessed a life being saved. I had played an important role in saving that life. It was an amazing moment and it brings tears to my eyes thinking about it.


Anyways, I'm wondering G_Chem, what dosages do you typically go for when using both MDMA and 5-MAPB in the same night? Whats your dosing schedule? I'm hesitant to mix emp[athogens because one night my old GF and I got really reckless and mixed a decent amount of MDAI and 5-MAPB and she went through a horrid case of serotonin withdrawal and I felt so awful watching her go thru that knowing it was because I didn't do enough research

This story is exactly the type of stuff I’m talking about, it’s such a powerful medicine and almost more reliably induces these revelatory experiences than MDMA does.  The thing about it though is if the person doesn’t have the proper framework to integrate that it can be traumatic.  This actually reminds me of this Erowid report, I highly suggest giving it a read as it’s in some ways similar.  (But with MDMA..)


Note I don’t fully agree with this persons assessment of the experience he saw his friend go through.  I think it could’ve gone a lot differently of course.

Sounds very therapeutic it made me cry when I first took it as my psychology opened up in a very well mind opening manner which includes the heart opening thinking of others and how selfish I am.


I've wanted to try 6-APB for a long time I think I tried 5 and realized something I was taking interacted with it so I stopped trying to take such things.

I'm very happy that you were able to experience that ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) Empathogens can be incredibly healing, but as others have said, they can of course be detrimental. 


There was a time where I was struggling with PTSD surrounding a psychotic break that I had while in heavy Meth and PV addiction. I wont go into too much details, but my symptoms were textbook paranoid schizophrenic. Grand delusions, everything happening around me was somehow connected to me, but the worst part is that I heard the voice of 3 different friends CONSTANTLY, even when not actively on a drug, and these voices were constantly telling me how much of a freak I was (I was very much struggling with my sexuality at that point), how horrible of a person I was and how the world would be better off without me. This went on non-stop for about 6 months before I attempted suicide. I woke up from the attempt from the voices gone, but I was now left with severe PTSD. After about a year or more of dealing with the constant intrusive thought, I realized that I wasnt going to make it many years before trying to attempt suicide again if I didnt do something to address the trauma. I didnt havve access to a therapist, but I did have access to MDMA. So I picked some up knowing the power that it could have. I contacted 3 friends to see if they were willing to take it with me, so I could talk to them openely about my experience. 2 of the friends were ones who were there at the time, and 2 of the voices that I had been hearing. Anyways, I talked through it, they helped me decipher what I experienced that was real and what had been my delusions.


This was at least 5 years ago now. I still have PTSD but surrounding other traumas that I've experienced. Since waking up the day after this particular session, I have had ZERO PTSD symptoms surrounding this particular trauma. Not only did I get to witness 5-MAPB save a close friends life, I was fortunate to have MDMA save my life. I now rarely use empathogens for recreation or shows (although I dont see anything wrong with that type of use). I know basically only use them if I'm taking it with one or two friends in a quiet, comfortable space where we can talk the night away and see into each others hearts

So I finally got to try 6-APB after having it my posession for almost 10 years. I dosed 80mg about an hour before going to an OTT concert.


Very nice material. Smooth but slow come up and while I took maybe 30-40mg of MDMA about 4 hours in, I think the APB was present for 8 hours.


Overall I would say it was quite similar to MDA, but it has a much slower onset (which I really liked) and a more gradual comedown. It was also less visual, for me MDA can actually get very visual though the visual effects dont seem to last more than 45 minutes or so.


Anyway, would repeat, eventually I will try 5-APB.

Mixed 55 mgs 6 apb with 25 mgs 5 mapbs.  Went to a music battle.  First time I heard something like this called a rave.  Anyways , got in there, tensed up a bit, then socializing became easier.  Talked to a lot of people. Approached girls, one wasn't nice, most were.


  When social interaction became boring I'd dance off to the dance floor or into another social interaction.   Stimulation was a bit high , I'd prefer it less ,this is why I took a smaller dose 6 apb .   I don't take stimulates much, except caffeine earlier , and it did keep me awake far too long into the morning than I'd prefer .


Hindsight is twenty, twenty, I wish I wouldn't have left the club when they close and attempted to hang out with a group of girls that came together as quite a few guys were trying with them , hanging in there.  Overall fun experience and this combo although a bit stimulated, the effects can be part of it.   That is why I wished I stayed with the girls so I could have company into the morning instead of being solo.   I could dose more 5 mapb  less 6 apb for another experiment. .   

In summary, This combo is a good one, for for a night out at a club that plays EDM music. Played some other tribesman music as well, that was oh so nurturing .

The previous post makes me consider seeking out 5-MAPB after not having a sample in my stash for about 6 years. Honestly enjoyed 5 more than MDMA which subsequent to my very first roll always had me feeling as if I needed to redose to reach peak. After falling into that trap enough times, I learned that peak was a carrot on a stick so I had to move on. Fast-forward to my first experience with 5 and I was practically a virgin again. Additionally, redose with 5 was much more advantageous than simply "chasing the dragon" but required quite a recovery period. Required may not even be the appropriate term, perhaps imposed is more accurate. As in, no manner of alarm could wake me the next morning. It was so long ago, but if I recall correctly 150mg was the best roll I've had from any empathogen. While there were some issues with batch consistency in addition to my body tolerance, never felt a waste of a roll with 5-MAPB. I have fond memories of turning my studio apartment into a music hall. Only, I was onstage and also in every seat in the audience. Blissful. Less fond memories of redosing and waking up late for work but I learned my lessons the hard way back then.

Planning on dropping 100 mg with a friend and go to a rave. Would staggering the dose 50 + 50 alleviate the nausea on the comeup? I have the 2013 stuff which I haven't tried ever, hopefully it has aged well hehe. Also, is it too sedating or stimulating in general? I have 4FA too but I really wanted to try this one out.

I am really surprised. I don't remember if I ever tried to plug 6-APB because I didn't think it was pluggable or snortable, and old stack (2011-2013 6-APB) used to work in 30 minutes after dinner. It was better if taken right after dinner! That changed with 6-APB from later batches. 

White 6-APBDB which was available from Germany back in 2014 was very snortable and quite nootropic in very small amounts, but APBs always had nasty smells.

So you’re saying later batches weren’t as good right after dinner? Which batches were the better in terms of feeling?

Unless you take 150 or 160 mg dose and then it's going to get a little harsher and last a really long time and get really really trippy with geometric visuals. Open eye and closed.


Yeah that lasted me about 23 hours. I think the visuals kicked in at about hour 11 significantly. At that dose it's very very stimulating and definitely not like MDEA or methylone.


5-APB OTOH was the most unequivocally erotic, entactogenic, empathogenic, substance that I have ever taken and beats the living snot out of MDMA. Now I happen to take 400 mg instead of 200 mg because I was high already and I couldn't remember if I had dosed or not so I was like fuck it. It couldn't be that bad. So I ended up taking two 200 mg doses of five-APB within like a half-hour of each other.


The erotic pleasure euphoria and body high of this substance is insane. I swear. I actually lost consciousness several times from the euphoria. At one point I was laying on my bed completely naked and the breeze from the ceiling fan blowing across my nipples actually made me orgasm, and I'm a male.


The best thing about five APB to me is that it caused no residual body load or anything. Once the roll was over it was like okay I'm done back to regular life. There was also no tachyphilaxis after even five consecutive days of dosing which I really liked and you can't get away with that with MDMA.

Later batches from the famous Spanish vendor, which no longer exists were getting weaker between 2014 to 2018. They would take 60 to 90 minutes to kick in and consuming food seemed to slow down absorption.  At least 180mg would be required which still would be less rolly and euphoric than 6-apb of prior years. They were of a lighter shade of tan have a milder scent than older batches, probably due to a solvent/purification process.

Interesting. I found dark brown 6-APBs acquired between 2011-2013 very pushy. We would always take them and go dancing for about 6 hours and then kill the trip with etizolam to fall asleep.

I can't tell you my exact age for security reasons, but I am a bit older than you are. I have been exercising daily all my life which is probably the main reason for having energy. I would say the bigger drain are long working hours - I am a very senior professional. I know a few people who are in their seventies and still come to raves or do ballroom dancing.  With the exception of 2011-2012 craziness when I took a sabbatical from work and through dating a burner woman discovered the whole RC scene,  I roll only a few times a year. Last year has been particularly light, as I and my significant other skipped a festival that we usually go to.  When I do go dancing or to music concerts, I mostly rely on BDO, which is extremely euphoric and heart-opening for me. Too bad that unlike with alcohol, I cannot socialize properly on it.

What I did become addicted to during my 2011-2012 RC immersion was reading about RCs on forums! ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Why can't you socialize on BDO? I mean I do get sort of drunk and very euphoric on BDO, and that may be weird if among sober people who knows me. Especially if combined with psychedelics. 


Anyhow, gonna buy me som new 6-APB soon. Have some old that wasn't very good - or I took too low dose and it was cut.


I was born in the 60's and empathogens do drain my energy much more than psychedelics nowadays.

Back  in the day my UK vendor gave me a freebie. A bag  "BenzoFury" containing 2 6-APB pellet's 100 mg.

Maybe the pellet's were overdosed.  But I have never been able to re-create that experience, using weighed powder. Not with 6-APB alone or combo's.


Never tried a higer dose though as I felt the Pellet's where a bit overwelming all ready. To me again flooring and they last quite a while. So you'd had to get a drink  & pee and get up and then notice its subtle psychedelic effect's.

Reminds me of my first batch of 5-MAPB.  Every batch since has paled in comparison.  I still have a little and every time I take it I’m blown away.  Down to my last 100mg tho so it’s being saved for the final experience.  Maybe when I meet someone really special to share it with.  (I like it best mixed with MDMA, so 100 is more than enough for 2.)

finally tried 6apb on its own and wow. For partying, this stuff might be my favorite. There were a few moments more towards the beginning where it was a tad bit sedating and tempered my dancing, but overall it had a push for me to just keep going.


5MAPB/mdma combo is absolutely great for dancing for me as well, but by the end I’m pretty ready to just go back home and chill out to music. 6apb had me ready to go all night at the afters. The trippy nature itself was also quite interesting and unique. Lots of of almost rainbow strobing halo effects off of people is the best way I can describe


This is easily one of my favs at this point

Yeah 6-apb last longer than mdma. When you think its over it hits you.   For empathogenic quality I like mdma and 5 mapb better. 6-apb good for a night out. For a night in 5 mapb is better.  Ive mixed 5mapb and 6 apb , on a night out-its okay but probally 6 apb may be better out.

Well  for me GHB and GBL. Which are pretty identical to 1.4-BDO. Socializing was just one of the effect's. Certainly didn't make me introvert. More then Alcohol it promoted socializing, even with drunk's as the difference is pretty small. Especially if everyone is on MDMA or Stimulantś to.

I'll be partying for two days in a row shortly, likely using 6-apb at some point while also trying out 5-mapb for the first time - so looking for some feedback on potential strategies.


I've been using 6-apb for 10 years or so - it's my go-to party substance.


I've currently also got some 5-mapb - never used it before.


Am in 2 minds about which of these 2 options to go with for my weekend - bear in mind that Day 2 will be a longer day of music and revelry (12-14 hours vs. 7-8 hours on Day 1


Option A: 

Day 1, small dose of 5-mapb (say 40mg) + some MDMA (not great quality) with potential redose of 5-mapb if effects not at all pronounced

Day 2, 6-apb only


I've used this MDMA the day before doing 6-apb before and still really enjoyed the 6-apb. Thoughts on the chances of the 5-mapb on Day 1 having a strong negative impact on Day 2? I've also used 6-apb twice in 3 days and enjoyed it.


Option B: 

Day 1, MDMA with a potential E pill (low strength) if I need an energy boost 

Day 2, small dose of 5-mapb, small redose after a couple of hours, then later in day some 6-apb to carry me through the night. Although if the 5-mapb is giving me enough dancing energy I could just stick to it.

For starters, I would warn against doing 5MAPB to start and then taking 5MAPB again later (1.5h+ after your first), this seems to have high potential to lead to disastrous results for whatever reason. Either stick to doing 5mapb then mdma, or mdma and then 5mapb.


I cannot personally speak to rolling two days in a row, except for the fact that when I go 5mapb+mdma, I feel that I certainly really drain my serotonin, that is to say, I’m not totally sure you are going to have enough to make the 6apb work as well? But I’ve never tried this so maybe just take it as similar caution to any, rolling two days in a roll situation.


If you had 6apb consecutively and were fine, then I’m not sure if the 5mapb should make a difference in that regard.


I’ll be feeling the movement this weekend.

I think my schedule will go:

Day 1: 2cb + g or k

Day 2: 6apb + g or k at end

Day 3: alcohol + k maybe light acid

Great info - thanks. I’ve read conflicting reports re 5-mspb dosage (15-100mg which is quite a wide distribution) and also re-dosing - some do it regularly, some warn against. 


Also curious about 2cb and its suitability for taking in a busy environment like a music festival - worth trying it as a Day 1 option ahead of either 5-Ampb or 6-apb on Day 2? 


From a bit of reading it’s more trippy than empathogenic - so hesitant about doing it in public. Have been on AMT at festivals plenty of times, and it’s sctually another option for Day 1… I have some of that…

Depends on the 5mapb quality, but if pure and hcl the it’s 2x mdma potency. If pre-roll 40mg is a solid dose.


2cb works great for a music festival imo and it doesn’t seem to diminish the potency of other drugs if taken before. It’s become the official Day 1 substance for me every time

Well, I just want to add my 2c to this. 


130mg 6-apb on an empty stomach absolutely not something I would want to do in public. First 45 minutes resulted in nausea and vomiting. Lots of it. Feeling very weak and needing to lie down.


After 1hr recovered, beautiful psychedelic space, though not as profound as a pure psychedelic.


At 3 hrs added 14mg of 2c-b to truly hit the stars.


Highly recommended. Will do 100mg next time.


This is lie at home and soak up the good feelings type of experience.


Tested positive for 6-APB across numerous reagent tests.

I would say the bigger drain are long working hours - I am a very senior professional. I know a few people who are in their seventies and still come to raves or do ballroom dancing.  With the exception of 2011-2012 craziness when I took a sabbatical from work and through dating a burner woman discovered the whole RC scene,  I roll only a few times a year. Last year has been particularly light, as I and my significant other skipped a festival that we usually go to.  When I do go dancing or to music concerts, I mostly rely on BDO, which is extremely euphoric and heart-opening for me. Too bad that unlike with alcohol, I cannot socialize properly on it.

Took it 1-st time at the point of life when i was running low, on emergency fuel.

Exhausted, malnutrition during a relocation of my fam.


Way later, so recent 2021, longterm exposure to external stressors, causing insomnia, bit back.

In form of seizures. Unexpected but after getting info about it, appeared a normal result.

So f*ck dr. s, their useless when push comes to shuff, if you notice them adding to the problem, better back off.


When youre way over the border of your capacitys [mental/ physical].

Getting back to where i am today, meanwhile others resuming stressing me still.

But lesson learned, no more seizure luckely.


Slowly started re-building myself mental/ physical, push myself to do it as anhedonia says NO.

So ignoring that atm. Feeling fit, but no way near where it was where i left off. But its my goal.


Pete & Bas [UK-Grime] are 70 +, energetic and bust bars blowing the young rappers away, high power 'FAN'.

So that gave hope, and when at a party. I dont need drugs anymore. If the music rolls, i go of my tits.

Surrounders might think he is crazy/ on drugs. But sober as i was born.


Danced way more energetic then  when on XTC and or Speed, no more need.  Drugs are catalysts, it the music that does the trick imo.

I would personally go with the borax combo. 6apb for me is much more suited for a night out raving. 5mapb itself is way more intimate and the combo will round the experience out nicely by providing some magic push for the music and such.

Thanks!

Would you say we should take a whole pellet?

I read somewhere that 50mg 5-MAPB alone can be a lot for some people.


So I guess I'd feel safer to take half or 3/4 first & redose the other half / 1/4 1-2h later.

Is that reasonable?

I would personally. 50mg will be equivalent to about 100mg of MDMA. Maybe a bit more with the borax stuff added in, but that’s just me.


Whatever you do, do not take more after the ~1.5h mark of 5mapb. There are some horror stories, so if you do decide to split and redose, see how you’re feeling at 1h and then make a decision.

I'm probably not familiar enough with benzofurans to make a great suggestion, have never done 5apb and only ever went through a couple grams of 6apb. But I definitely preferred 5mapb in general, it definitely felt like a more full empathogen, 6apb, I mean it's ok but to me it wasn't particularly euphoric, just kinda felt like a sorta sparkly mild Amphetamine or phenethylamine (while not even feeling as euphoric as standard amphetamine).


I would personally go with that combo, but I've also tried All that stuff, and I like 5meomipt and 2fma is ok as a stim, so that just sounds like a more full experience. 6apb was underwhelming for me in those types of doses, but I may have had a mediocre batch and I also do just have bit of natural tolerance to those kinds of drugs. If you're comfortable with the environment you'll be in, and are experienced with psychs, stims, And empathogens, it should be ok.


But you may want to start with half of those pills, just in case you have more intense reaction to the benzofuran than you'd expect

We decided to take 5-APB.


First 55mg, since it was our first time with a benzofuran. Then a 40mg booster 2h later, followed by a final 60mg dose another hour later.


It was magnificent. Therapeutic, bonding, euphoric, spiritual & rational.


We started to inhale N2O an hour after taking the third dose, which catapulted us into pure bliss & empathy, interesting thoughts & ego dissolution.

It was way better than my past experiences with MDMA + N2O.


It was beautiful.


Next time I'd take 90mg 5-APB initially.


We still felt loaded 9h after the third dose.

Got to sleep only 12h after the last dose, being awake 26h.


I feel a bit tired, but mostly fine after 4h of sleep. Still have some empathogenic afterglow.

The only benzofuran I've used is 6-APB (was sold as 5-APB about a year and a half ago, but was mislabeled), but have mixed it with ketamine and countless other dissociatives before. I often describe 6-APB as stimmier, less psychedelic MDA that feels more like amphetamine or a phenidate than it does methamphetamine, which is how I'd describe MDMA instead. Mixing 6-APB with ketamine/NMDA antagonists, or salvia really added some magic back to the experience in a way that it lacks when compared to MDA or MDMA. My favorite 6-APB combination was with 2C-B, 2F-DCK and a whippet tank.

I'm a psychedelic hardhead who trips way the fuck too much and who's spent a ton of time with 2C-B, so I usually would end up using anywhere from 50-100mg of 2C-B throughout the night. Open up with a bump or small line of 15-25mg, put 45mg in a cotton candy Faygo, and just sip it throughout the night, considering further insufflation.


Using 2C-B before 6-APB helped me to enter the roll with a better headspace since I fucking love 2C-B and it's tough to feel down when on it, however taking the 6-APB first and then the 2C-B while rolling balls is pretty fun and it makes the roll feel 10-12 hours long all together. I suspect that the latter, or just tripping before/during/after the roll, lead to the best integration after all is said and done.

See I tried 6-apb over ten years, and I recall having some very intricate psychedelic visuals. The degree of psychedelia fluctuated with my 6 or so trials, but all of them had a visual aspect to them. 


Fast forward 14 years ahead and I don’t get many visuals from psychs at all. MDMA makes me feel completely dysphoric, however I did manage to try MDA a couple years and that still gets me going. It can cause some perceptible visual effects, but they’re fairly subtle. 


I’m torn between buying the 6-APB or MDA. I want to mix them with some psychs. 4-ho-mipt is what I’d prefer, but I can grab some 4-ho-met for cheap. Only issue is its short duration may not coincide with the 6apb/mda. Wanted to go with an easier goin trip, but usually I’d opt for LSD. 


Would you say MDA or 6-APB mixes better with psychs/disso/etc.? I have 100mg of 25b-NBOH, but that’s a sketchy one to do or combine.

I would advise against combining 25X-NBXX drugs with any monoamine releaser, such as MDA, MDMA, amphetamine, or methamphetamine. One time I mixed a relatively high dose of 25C-NBOMe, a moderate dose of MDA, and a normal dose of a street Xanny (probably bromazolam). Without the benzo tamping things down, the night might've gone awry, but I'm not going to lie, I had a pretty good time. **I would never advise anybody mix these, both alone are toxic and one has led to countless deaths even at very low doses**. It was about 4.8mg of 25C-NBOMe, 125mg of MDA, and then that street xanny.


The 6-APB I got was part of that hyper potent batch that went out a couple years ago, which ended up being an isomerically pure batch of 5-APB. Threshold was  ~12-15mg, and taking more than 75mg or so was intensely punishing. More punishing than 600mg of pharma Adderall. There was some talk on BL around that time about this batch, it led to some heinous and damaging overdoses because people would get it in and take 150+mg, ending up in pretty rough shape. This shit would often last 10-12 hours, redosing would push it easily past 24 hours of noticeable effects. It was starkly non-visual compared to MDA, but was relatively on par with MDMA's mild visuals (tracers, color enhancement, equivalent to maybe ~75ug of LSD).


MDA almost always mixes better with things than 6-APB, but 6-APB lasts way longer, has more stimulation, and less visuals. I found MDA significantly more empathogenic and "love-inducing" if that makes sense. For mixing with 4-substituted tryptamines, I would highly suggest MDA, as the timelines line up better and I find MDA to be more rewarding in general.

Would like to share my first exprience with 6apb with the community.


Mdma is probably my all time favourite substance but was always real into taking it reponsibly going as far as to rerock anything id get before consumig in order to be 100% sure id be consuming as pure a substance as i could.


Sadly lost the contact and havent managed to find any only pills and after reagent testing none of the ones i managed to find made me think it was worthwhile trying to do an acetone wash and crystalize what was there.


So i found out about 6apb and got some 100mg pills to experiment. I was extra cautious and only took 1 and a redose of half 2h later (big fella weighing 240 pounds).


While i know i should have probably taken 2x considering my body weight it was a good first intro. I spent a good 3h dancing with a friend by the lake shirt off and everyting to old school bassline tunes, the wobbles felt nice. 


It was very gentle and had a few of those mdma like waves of euphoria, but i didnt roll hard. I miss absolutely off my tits on mdma smoking joint after joint and dancing real hard for spells when the music really begs to do it.


I will try a much bigger those next time(probably 2 pills and 1 for redose) and will try getting some in crystal form rather than pills so i can dose more precisely if next session goes as i hope.


The drug was real clean tho, come up took a while but there was nothing speedy or dirty to it come down was real gentle and was able to go to sleep 8h after last dose so happy days.


Looking forward to keep discoveing this substance as well as 5mapb, hoping to find something i can be rolling balls hard off feeling ridiculous bursts of pure happiness and euphoric bliss.


Thanks for reading and would appreciate any comments/advice and such.

If you can't find crystal, don't hesitate to crush up x amount of pills, weigh that pile of crushed up pills, put it in a container and shake the **shit** out of it, and then whatever dosage x amount of pills should've added up to, you can now consider somehwat "ghettoishly homogenized", to try to get them more even. Pill pressing is incredibly difficult to do accurately, and when friends of mine in college would get ecstasy pills in groups of like, 50-100 tablets, they'd reagent test little chunks of say 5% of the batch, and then crush them all up, homogenize as I'd mentioned, and then divide the total crushed up weight by how many tablets they had, and they'd put the powder in gel caps.


It's also worthwhile to learn how to recrystallize your ecstasy via water recrystallization if you want to get the absolutely cleanest product possible.

Very interesting. So you recommend crushing the pills and stirring them and say if 10 pills were 100 mg of active princple and after crushing they weighed x; divide x by the number of pills and take acordingly? Makes sense that crushing and trying to homogenize as much as possible would be the mixture more well homogenous lol.

I didnt know mdma could be recrystalized with water makes sense tho since it is water soluble. Ive always done with isopropyl and then id crush the crytals and vaccum purge.


Thanks for your input it is greatly appreciated. Have you had much experience with 6apb or 5mapb?

I think I've asked this before, but as the benzofurans were made popular after the laws of many nations made 'all ring substituted ampetamines' known or unknown automatically illegal, have people tried other aromatic systems? 1-(1-benzothiophen-6-yl)propan-2-amine for example. I can't find any data or even if the compound has ever been made. But the fact that 4MTA was shown to be active (although had a dangerous side-effect) may suggest that swapping an O for an S at the *meta* position of the benzene ring may provide for something both active and relatively benign.

Had another try with a bigger dose (2 100mg pills and 1 more after 90 min). Should have waited another week since last session but was too curious to feel its effects propperly.

It was very nice indeed, very similar effects ro mdma indeed but without that overwhelming rush mdma can have at times which i find somewhat unpleasant and can bring nausea. None of that with 6apb. Peak was reached at about 3 to 4h in lasted a a good 2h with waves of euphoria where breathing in deeply and letting out a screaming sigh feels seriosuly amazing. Danced on and off for a good 5h and smoking weed feels crazy nice was chain smoking joints and a couple of cigars.

Was able to sleep about 10h after last dose and sleep was restful. Hangover wise only a slight headache though unsure if it could be becausei literaly drank a good 6l of water while rolling, i wasnt even forcing to drink i was just so thirsty.

The come up is real gentle, the few times i rolled hard were very very pleasant and clean and the come down is gradual and slow.

Pretty sure im a fan of this substance.

For me, less than 200mg with the fumarate it's not fun enough, good perhaps for a low-key social setting but if I want to roll hard with the FUMARATE, then 200mg are needed...

Seems that the Hcl version was much better, more potent and it worked nicely a bit over 100mg

Id agree after having taken 200mg and 100mg later. Next time i plan on going 300 mg to roll my spheres off and a redose closer to the peak. Tempted to add some lysergamide to the mix but well see. Looking forward to getting 6apb in crystal form though as well as 5mapb.


Thanks for your input!

According to this article benzothiophene based "amphetamines" are more potent releasers of serotonin than their benzofuranyl analogs. They also have a higher affinity for the 5-ht-2 receptors and cause rats to develop the stereotype head twitch which indicates psychedelic like activity.


Benzothiophenes are just like benzofurans except benzothiophenes have a sulfer where benzofurans have an oxygen (and indoles have a nitrogen).


The three chemicals that they picked out to highlight were 3-APBT, 5-APBT, and 6-APBT. 


5 and 6-APBT are...

We took 70mg 6-APB succinate 40min ago.

The taste was quite unpleasent - salty & sour. The color is light brown & it's from a famos NL vendor.

It starts to kick in I think - I get the typical heat flushes & slight uneasiness in the stomach.


We also took 10mg O-PCE 5h ago, which is slightly effecting us still.


It's gonna be a fun night I think - maybe we'll redose with 5-MAPB boofed, maybe take some more O-PCE + N2O.


Will report back.

Our night was great.

It was pretty heavy substance mixing, since this was the only day we could really go far out for the next 1 & 1/2 months or so.


We started with a small - moderate dose O-PCE (8,5mg) in the afternoon & watched a Ghibli movie & got us some vietnamese food.

Ghibli is the perfect match for low to mid disso doses.


Then we took the 70mg 6-APB succinate after being pretty much down from the O-PCE.

I had some nausea, all in all it was very pleasent though. Did some good open talking & some N2O balloons.

It was relatively strong for me, a bit mild for my trip partner (female). I guess I'm pretty sensitive to empathogens.


After 1 1/2 h we decided to add 40mg 5-MAPB rectally, which was a good choice. No nausea, pretty quick onset.


Then we smoked 2 40mg MET salt in an oil pipe, which made us have mild visuals & produced a mystical, therapeutical vibe.

N2O enhanced the effects considerably.


We redosed 2 more times with 40mg 5-MAPB rectally. A bit excessive, but bruxism wasn't too bad.


At like 2 or 3 AM we started to snort big ketamine lines & I had very interesting visual k-holes & my whole life got evaluated. My traumas surfaced & I remembered forgotten childhood memories, thought about the death of my parents, my kratom dependance, all my pains.


It was very demanding & hurt a lot. It did feel healing though (or at least now I have the chance to turn it to a healing experience by talking, writing & thinking about all that's going wrong in my life).


Now, after 5h of sleep, I still feel very opened, also tired & a bit sad.


This was extraordinary & I'm looking forward to experiment with MET on it's own in the future.


I had zero withdrawal symptoms even 24h after my last kratom dose btw, very unusual

I'm just going through kratom withdrawals right now, one of the worst I went through, perhaps because my use scalated to around 18 grams a day, when normally I was around 10-12, it is like the first time but with more anxiety and less other symptoms, the kava kills the anxiety for a while, but not too much, gotta go for a big walk now before trying to sleep, just to see if it works, my sugar levels (I'm diabetice type 1) are wrecked, like I can barely eat and need to inject almost double insulin.

Your experiment seems interesting and worthwhile but I would honestly wouldn't do it, as it seems pretty unsafe (for my standards). At least you dosages werent' that high, so cool with that harm reduction.

Ketamine alone in small to mid doses can reduce kratom withdrawal symptoms drastically.


A few 30mg lines + 1.25mg Lorazepam made withdrawal from 500-800mg O-DSMT a day rectally feel like a breeze. I only did that for the second & third day to not get addicted to ket / benzos though.

I don't have NMDA antagonists  atm, well, I have Huperzine A that has helped quite a bit in big doses, perhaps because it acts as a weak NMDA antagonist at that doses..

will pick it with me, as I need to do a long travel for2 days (kratom withdrawals while going through a "break up" with an avoidant girl and travelling, not a good moment honestly), will pick my kava kava bag, huperzine A, l-theanine and I have some diazepam and out of date of consumption lorazepam I have here. I hate benzos, but the reality is they help in those moments, I currently have insomnia like a "normal" thing, so the kratom insomnia is just impossible to overcome without a lot of stuff.

Huperzine A is also a potent acetylcholinesterase inhibitor which increases acetylcholine. This can contribute to mental stimulation/racing thoughts so be aware!

Theanine is also an NMDA antagonist and stops the cortisol stress response.


If you can, get agmatine which is excellent for reducing withdrawal symptoms. It's otc and fairly cheap. It shares similar properties to ketamine (NMDA antagonist, AMPA, mTOR).

Since there doesn't seem to be a 5-APB thread, I'll leave that here:


Took 20mg 5-APB (very white, supposedly HCl) in 0.5ml water rectally. Burned a bit.

After 30min it was clear it's an empathogen (we were cautious since it was the first time trying that batch) & redosed 60mg 5-APB in 0.5ml.

Burned a lot & quite long. Should have used at least 1.5ml water.


The effects were quite intense.

More intense than 80mg orally.

The comeup was even pretty harsh, I got very warm.


I think 60mg rectally are enough. I'm more on the sensitive side though.


We combined it with ket / 2FDCK after a while & it was a very lucid, long talk & a loooot of thinking about life.

The combo has therapeutic potential.


After effects were mild.
