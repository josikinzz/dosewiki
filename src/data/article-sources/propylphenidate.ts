## Subjective Experience

Propylphenidate (PPH) was one of a number of methylphenidate related chemicals
banned in the UK via a TCDO in April 2015. As this came shortly after its release, it
had a very limited period of open sale. Falling under the same axe were
Ethylphenidate, 3,4-Dichloromethylphenidate, Methylnaphthidate and
Isopropylphenidate. Fortunately, I had obtained a small sample of 250mg a few
weeks earlier, and was able to test it just in time.

Dosage information had yet to become established, particularly for insufflation, so I
elected to proceed with particular caution.

\`\`\`
T+0:00 Tipping the packet gently, 21mg pops out of the bag. I line it up and
snort. It stings, making my right eye water. I feel the chemical burn as it
subsequently rolls down the back of my throat. [4:22pm]
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+0:05 I can already feel something coming-on as the pain dissipates. A mild
head warmth emerges, and a general stimulation is suddenly present.
\`\`\`

\`\`\`
T+0:10 This has settled down now, into a low level background sort of mode. I
feel fine, more alive than I did, and perhaps with a slight mood lift.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+0:15 Thus far this is completely functional, with no horn or other
distinguishing features. I still have the foul taste at the back of my throat.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+0:25 There has been no significant change since the onset. Perhaps my
head now feels a strange heaviness, and I am warmer. As this is almost
certainly the last time I will sample this compound, I am considering a redose
of perhaps 10mg, to move into more commonly referenced territory. Can I
face that pain though?
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+0:30 I summon the courage and snort the 15mg that falls out of the bag. I
bin the rest as a precaution. This isn’t to say that I believe there is much
chance of compulsive redosing.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+0:45 Perhaps I feel more elevated than previously, and I am certainly
content. This is nowhere near to the main (illegal) stims, but is fairly pleasing
in its own steady way (apart from the now runny nose).
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+0:55 I feel that I have stabilised at this point, as per the last update. I check
my blood pressure. It is 152/78: elevated but only slightly. Pulse rate is
hovering above 60, which again, isn’t far off the mark.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+1:00 Whilst on this plateau I feel generally comfortable. This isn’t bad, but
relatively, it isn’t a high flying ride. It’s just pleasant, at least at this dose.
Without the assurance of popular use, I wouldn’t really wish to push it any
higher.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+2:00 On the two hour mark I am still under the influence, although perhaps
at a reduced level. I feel a somewhat heavy type of head buzz, albeit minor in
nature, and a bit of a tingly feel to my face and arms. My hands are a little
chilly.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+3:00 I am slowly coming-down, and hoping that the night’s sleep isn’t too
badly affected. My poor nostril remains uncomfortable. However, I am able to
eat normally (so no real appetite suppression), and socialise as usual.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+16:00 I spent the rest of the evening blowing my nose, and as feared the
night’s sleep was rather disturbed, at least until the early hours. This morning
I feel broadly within normal parameters.
\`\`\`
I didn’t expect this to light any fires, and it didn’t. However, apart from the painful
insufflation, it was quite pleasant if a little underwhelming. Had it remained on the
market it may have found a niche as part of a combination or blend, but I doubt that
it would have ever been a big hitter in terms of popularity. It isn’t a chemical I would
ever have made a habit of using.

Propylphenidate (also known as PPH) is a piperidine based stimulant drug, closely related to methylphenidate, but with the methyl ester replaced by a propyl ester. It was banned in the UK as a Temporary Class Drug from April 2015 following its unapproved sale as a designer drug.

## Legal status

Propylphenidate is illegal in Sweden as of 26 January 2016, and in Finland since 2017.
