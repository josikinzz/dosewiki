# 5-MeO-DMT
*Source: https://thedrugclassroom.com/video/5-meo-dmt/*

5-MeO-DMT is a psychedelic tryptamine that appears to be an endogenous drug. It can be found in many plants and is also produced by the Bufo alvarius toad.

The drug has been used for centuries in South America and the Caribbean. To this day, it is used by indigenous groups in the form of intranasal snuffs.

It can produce fully dissociative psychedelic experiences, similar to DMT. However, 5-MeO-DMT is far less visual with its effects and seems more likely to cause terror/anxiety responses.
