Methylethyltryptamine (MET), also known as N-methyl-N-ethyltryptamine (N,N-MET), is a psychedelic drug of the tryptamine family. It is taken orally or via inhalation.
The drug acts as an agonist of the serotonin 5-HT2 receptors and to a lesser extent as a serotonin releasing agent. It is closely related to dimethyltryptamine (DMT) and to diethyltryptamine (DET).
MET appears to have been first described in the literature in 1981. It was only briefly mentioned in Alexander Shulgin's 1997 book TiHKAL (Tryptamines I Have Known and Loved). The drug was encountered as a novel designer drug in Europe in 2014.

## Use and effects

MET was briefly mentioned in Alexander Shulgin's TiHKAL (Tryptamines I Have Known and Loved) and other publications, where he has stated it to be orally active as a psychedelic at doses of 80 to 100 mg. Its duration, onset, and peak were not provided. The free base of MET has been reported to be active as a psychedelic via vaporization at a dose of 15 mg per informal anecdotal reports. Very little information is available on the effects of MET. However, its effects have been reported to include hallucinations, euphoria, tactile enhancement, cognitive effects, pupil dilation, muscle cramps, teeth grinding, and increased heart rate and blood pressure.

## Interactions

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

MET is a serotonin 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptor partial agonist. It shows very weak activity as an agonist of the serotonin 5-HT1A and 5-HT2B receptors. In addition to acting at the serotonin 5-HT2 receptors, MET is a serotonin releasing agent with lower potency. It produces the head-twitch response, a behavioral proxy of psychedelic effects, in animals.

## Chemistry

MET, also known as N-methyl-N-ethyltryptamine, is a substituted tryptamine derivative. It is closely related to N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) and to other N,N-dialkylated tryptamines.

### Analogues

Analogues of MET besides DMT include DET, DPT, DiPT, DBT, MiPT, MBT, EPT, EiPT, and PiPT, among others. Derivatives of MET include 4-HO-MET, 5-MeO-MET, bretisilocin (5-fluoro-MET; GM-2505), and 7-F-5-MeO-MET, among others.

## History

MET appears to have first been described in the literature by 1981. It was specifically mentioned in Michael Valentine Smith's Psychedelic Chemistry. Subsequently, MET was briefly described in Alexander Shulgin's TiHKAL (Tryptamines I Have Known and Loved) in 1997. MET was encountered as a novel designer drug in Europe in 2014.
