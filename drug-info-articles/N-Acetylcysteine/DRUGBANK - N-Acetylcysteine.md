14
,
15
,
16
,
17
It has a short duration of action as it is given every 1-8 hours depending on route of administration, and has a wide therapeutic window.
14
,
15
,
16
,
17
Patients should be counselled regarding diluting oral solutions in cola for taste masking,
7
the risk of hypersensitivity, and the risk of upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage.

17

### Mechanism of Action

Glutathione synthetase
Stimulator
Cystine/glutamate transporter
Activator

### Absorption

An 11 g dose in the form of an effervescent tablet for solution reaches a mean C
max
of 26.5 µg/mL, with a T
max
of 2 hours, and an AUC of 186 µg*h/mL.
17

### Metabolism

Acetylcysteine can be deacetylated by aminoacylase 1 or other undefined deacetylases before undergoing the normal metabolism of cysteine.

### Half-life

The mean terminal half life of acetylcysteine in adults is 5.6 hours
15
and in pre-term neonates is 11 hours.
2

### Toxicity

Patients experiencing an overdose may present with vomiting, nausea, bronchospasm, periorbital angioedema, and hypotension.
3
Treat patients with symptomatic and supportive measures.
15
Hemodialysis may remove some acetylcysteine from circulation as it is somewhat protein bound.

### Mechanism of action

A number of possible mechanisms for the mucolytic activity of acetylcysteine have been proposed. Acetylcysteine's sulfhydryl groups may hydrolize disulfide bonds within mucin, breaking down the oligomers, and making the mucin less viscous.
11
,
16
Acetylcysteine has also been shown to reduce mucin secretion in rat models.
11
It is an antioxidant in its own right but is also deacetylated to cysteine, which participates in the synthesis of the antioxidant glutathione.
11
The antioxidant activity may also alter intracellular redox reactions, decreasing phosphorylation of EGFR and MAPK, which decrease transcription of the gene MUC5AC which produces mucin.
11
In the case of acetaminophen overdoses, a portion of the drug is metabolized by CYP2E1 to form the potentially toxic metabolite N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI).
16
The amount of NAPQI produced in an overdose saturates and depletes glutathione stores.
16
The free NAPQI promiscuously binds to proteins in hepatocytes, leading to cellular necrosis.
16
Acetylcysteine can directly conjugate NAPQI or provide cysteine for glutathione production and NAPQI conjugation.

### General Function

Secondary active transporter that functions as a Na(+)-independent organic anion (OA)/dicarboxylate antiporter where the uptake of one molecule of OA into the cell is coupled with an efflux of one molecule of intracellular dicarboxylate such as 2-oxoglutarate or glutarate (PubMed:11669456, PubMed:11907186, PubMed:14675047, PubMed:22108572, PubMed:23832370, PubMed:28534121, PubMed:9950961). Mediates the uptake of OA across the basolateral side of proximal tubule epithelial cells, thereby contributing to the renal elimination of endogenous OA from the systemic circulation into the urine (PubMed:9887087). Functions as a biopterin transporters involved in the uptake and the secretion of coenzymes tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), dihydrobiopterin (BH2) and sepiapterin to urine, thereby determining baseline levels of blood biopterins (PubMed:28534121). Transports prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and prostaglandin F2-alpha (PGF2-alpha) and may contribute to their renal excretion (PubMed:11907186). Also mediates the uptake of cyclic nucleotides such as cAMP and cGMP (PubMed:26377792). Involved in the transport of neuroactive tryptophan metabolites kynurenate (KYNA) and xanthurenate (XA) and may contribute to their secretion from the brain (PubMed:22108572, PubMed:23832370). May transport glutamate (PubMed:26377792). Also involved in the disposition of uremic toxins and potentially toxic xenobiotics by the renal organic anion secretory pathway, helping reduce their undesired toxicological effects on the body (PubMed:11669456, PubMed:14675047). Uremic toxins include the indoxyl sulfate (IS), hippurate/N-benzoylglycine (HA), indole acetate (IA), 3-carboxy-4- methyl-5-propyl-2-furanpropionate (CMPF) and urate (PubMed:14675047, PubMed:26377792). Xenobiotics include the mycotoxin ochratoxin (OTA) (PubMed:11669456). May also contribute to the transport of organic compounds in testes across the blood-testis-barrier (PubMed:35307651)
