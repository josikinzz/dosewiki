**25I-NBOMe can be fatal at heavy doses.^[1]** **It is strongly discouraged to take large amounts of this substance or to snort it. **

25I-NBOMe or 2C-I-NBOMe is a serotonergic N-benzyl derivative of the substituted phenethylamine psychedelic known as 2C-I.

It has nearly no history of human use prior to 2010 when it first became popular due its ease of purchase from online research chemical vendors.

25I-NBOMe was discovered in 2003 by Ralf Heim at the Free University of Berlin. It differs from 2C-I structurally through a substitution on the amine (NH2) with a 2-methoxybenzyl (BOMe) group as shown in the image above. This change in structure results in a sixteen fold increase in potency when compared to 2C-I, allowing even the most extreme of dosages to fit in liquid form onto tabs and blotter paper (which people often mistake for LSD).

There are, however, methods of differentiating between LSD and adulterants like 25I-NBOMe with and without test kits.

For example, one of the key differences between 25I-NBOMe and LSD is that this substance is only active when taken through a sublingual or insufflated route. This means that in order to get the full effects, 25I-NBOMe blotter paper must be lightly chewed on within the mouth for 10 - 20 minutes and never immediately swallowed.

Insufflation, however, is not recommended due to the amount of people who have suffered through dangerous and often fatal overdoses due to this route of administration.

25I-NBOMe is pharmacologically unique when compared to other psychedelics through the way in which it is one of the only full agonists for the human 5ht2a receptor in existence. In comparison, classical psychedelics such as LSD, DMT and psilocin can only be considered partial agonists.

This difference in receptor affinity results in an unusual and qualitatively different trip which based on the predefined potential subjective effects index found [here](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effects_index), I will now begin to breakdown and describe.

**Physical effects:**

The physical effects of 25I-NBOMe can be broken down into six components all of which progressively intensify proportional to dosage. These are described below and generally include:

- **Sublingual numbing** - assuming the substance has been taken sublingually, the very first physical effect which a person will notice immediately after sublingual absorption is a strong, unpleasant metallic chemical taste. This is accompanied by a very obvious feeling of general numbness of the tongue and mouth which can stay for up to an hour after the blotter paper has been consumed. This is the key difference when it comes to determining whether your blotter paper contains LSD or one of the NBOMe series.
- **Spontaneous tactile sensations** - the body high itself can be described as a generally mild, all-encompassing, soft but euphoric tingling sensation. This tingling sensation is also accompanied by spontaneous rushes of euphoria that become longer and more drawn out proportional to the dosage consumed.
- **Decreased bodily weight** - in terms of the body’s perceived weight, this substance consistently leaves people feeling extremely light, often to the point of total weightlessness.
- **Stimulation** - in terms of its effects on the physical energy levels of the tripper 25I-NBOMe is usually considered to be very energetic and stimulating. For most people, this substance induces a unique type of physical stimulation which can be described as feeling extremely energetic but in a way which does not force the tripper to move unless they genuinely choose to do so. For others however, the stimulation can be quite uncontrollable, occasionally resulting in bodily shakes and a grinding of the teeth comparable to that of MDMA and traditional stimulants such as amphetamine.
- **Vasoconstriction** - this is defined as the narrowing of the blood vessels resulting from contraction of the muscular wall of the vessels and is triggered through the way in which 25I-NBOMe’s target receptor (5-HT2A) modulates both vasoconstriction and vasodilation among its many other functions. It can be described as feelings of tightness within one’s arms and legs.
- **Nausea** - as the tripper begins to come up, nausea is not uncommon and can sometimes result in initial vomiting, but passes once this has either happened or the trip begins to fully set in. In comparison to other psychedelics such as psilocin, LSD, 2C-E and 2C-I, this could actually be very considered very mild in its intensity.

**Cognitive effects:**

The head space of 25I-NBOMe is described by many as remarkably light and underwhelming in comparison to the classical psychedelics. It is not uncommon for people to report feeling that their thought stream has maintained general normality in its specific style throughout low to moderate dosages. At high dosages however, mild to overwhelming cognitive alterations become present.

The most prominent of these cognitive effects generally include:

- **Introspection** - this component is consistently manifested only in the context of a non-social setting in which the user is alone.
- **Acceleration of thought**
- **Ego suppression, loss and death**
- **Time distortion**
- **Feelings of fascination, importance and awe**
- **Conceptual thinking**
- **Connectivity of thought**
- **Enhancement of current mind state**
- **Removal of cultural filter**
- **Increased empathy, love and sociability** - the entactogenic effects range from mild to powerful, but are inconsistently manifested. Entactogenic effects for people who try this substance usually become prominent in the presence of others. These feelings of increased sociability, love and empathy do not seem to be quite as strong or profound as those found within other entactogens (such as MDMA, 2C-B and AMT)

**Visual effects:**

*Enhancements*

25I-NBOMe presents a full and complete array of possible visual enhancements which generally include:

- **Increased visual acuity**
- **Enhancement of colours**
- **Enhanced pattern recognition**

*Distortions*

The visual distortions and alterations which are experienced are detailed below:

- **Visual drifting** (*melting, flowing, breathing and morphing*) - In comparison to other psychedelics, this effect can be described as highly detailed, slow and smooth in motion, static in their appearance and unrealistic/cartoon like in style.
- **Tracers**
- **After images**
- **Texture repetition **- In comparison to other psychedelics such as LSD or psilocin, this particular visual alteration is significantly more basic and less intricate in style but still distinctively present.

*Geometry*

The visual geometry that is present throughout this trip is often described as similar in appearance to that of LSD. They can be comprehensively described as algorithmic in geometric style, intricate in complexity, fine and zoomed out in detail, fast and smooth in motion, structured in shape, colourful in scheme, glossy in colour, sharp around the edges and mostly rounded across their corners. In comparison to other more commonly used psychedelics, they can be described as significantly more intricate than the visual geometry found within 2C-I and most of the 2C-x family and are completely on par with LSD, Psilocin and DMT at appropriately high dosages.

In terms of their behaviour, 25I-NBOMe’s geometry leads onto Level 7A visual geometry with Level 7B remaining so far unconfirmed within this substance. They also seem to consistently build up in visual intensity when the tripper stares at a central point. This eventually envelops the visual field and creates the sensation that the tripper has broken through into a continuously shifting geometric landscape or structure with a vast sense of immersive physical size attributed to it.

*Hallucinatory states*

25I-NBOMe is capable of producing a full range of hallucinatory states within the level 1 - 3 range extremely consistently. However, level 4 hallucinatory breakthroughs are reported but very uncommon and inconsistent in comparison to other more commonly used psychedelics such as psilocin, 2C-E and DMT.

These effects include:

- **External hallucinations**
- **Internal hallucinations** - this particular effect commonly contains hallucinations within scenarios, settings, concepts and autonomous entity contact. They are more common within dark environments and can be described as internal in their manifestation, lucid in believability, interactive in style and almost exclusively of religious, spiritual, mystical or a transcendental nature in their overall theme.

**Auditory effects:**

The auditory effects of 25I-NBOMe are common in their occurrence and exhibit a full range of effects which commonly include:

- **Enhancements**
- **Distortions**
- **Hallucinations**

**Health effects, addiction potential and tolerance:**

25I-NBOMe is a very new substance and little is known about its pharmacological or behavioural risks. The LD50 is not known. Some deaths have been attributed to 25I-NBOMe overdoses caused by improper handling and uneducated use of this substance. Its recent widespread use suggests that death is primarily caused from overdoses and not from ordinary doses, particularly from insufflation.

The fact that 25I-NBOMe is active in the microgram range is likely a contributing factor since this makes measuring doses significantly more difficult.

It’s worth noting that although many 5-HT2A agonists have documented safety, none of these have been full agonists so their safety data cannot be applied to 25I-NBOMe.

In terms of its addictive potential, 25I-NBOMe has not been studied formally but due to its immediate tolerance build up which lasts up to 2 - 3 weeks after the experience, it is essentially impossible to use this substance compulsively.

**Legal issues:**

- 25I-NBOMe is unscheduled under United States federal law. However, it could possibly be considered an analog of 2C-I (a Schedule I controlled substance) under the Federal Analogue Act. In this case, sale or possession of 25I-NBOMe with the intent of human consumption would be illegal.
- Virginia, Louisiana, and Florida have specifically scheduled 25I-NBOMe as a Schedule I controlled substance.
- All NBOMe substituted phenethylamines are controlled in Russia.

In other countries, however, 25I-NBOMe is completely unscheduled and freely available to anybody with an internet connection. If you wish to obtain this substance despite the risks involved you can literally type “buy 25I-NBOMe” into google and find several legitimate vendors on the very first page.

Please keep in mind however that 25I-NBOMe is **NOT** being sold by anybody specifically for the purposes human consumption as this would be genuinely illegal within most if not all countries.

**Conclusion:**

In conclusion, 25I-NBOMe is an extremely interesting psychedelic but does not quite compare in terms of visual and cognitive depth if you have access to classical psychedelics such as genuine LSD, DMT and psilocin.

I will not be seeking this substance out again but experimenting with it has certainly been an interesting and enjoyable experience.

DESCRIPTION #
 
General Effects Notes
 2C-I-NBOMe shares some chemical structural similarity to 2C-I and is a very potent 5HT2A agonist with active doses under 1 milligram (1000 ug). Its effects have been compared to 2C-I, LSD, and DOI. There are some reports that effects can be very unpredictable, even with the same person taking the same dose at different times. 
 
 Surprisingly, many reports state that 2C-I-NBOMe does not suppress appetite, cause dry mouth, or make food taste too strange to ingest. Appetite suppression is common on euphoriants and psychedelics and 2C-I-NBOMe seems distinct from LSD, DOI, and 2C-I in this regard. 
 
 There have been several reports of users of 25C-NBOMe and 25I-NBOMe experienced peripheral vasocontriction that required medical attention. Symptoms begin with tingling, coldness, bluing, and numbness in the fingers, toes, lips, nose, and other extremities. Swelling in the hands, feet, and face have been reported. One user reported numbness lasting more than a week after use. 
 
 
Addiction and Compulsive Use
 Though some reports mention that re-dosing is possible, its duration and psychedelic qualities make compulsive use seem unlikely. However, because its use is so new and uncommon, no definitive statements about it can yet be made.
 
EXPERIENCE EXCERPTS #
 
[750 ug, sublingal] "I was laughing hysterically at everything R is saying, and vise versa. The OEV's/CEV's are incredibly intricate an unavoidable. Definitely an incredibly detailed and layered fractal pattern. I am most certainly in a profound psychedelic headspace (i.e. I intuitively understand the universe, society, etc.) [...] It's much more of a pure psychedelic than it's non-benzyl substituted cousin 2C-I, while still retaining some of the entactogen qualities." -- [Exp 93342](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=93342)
 
[500-1000 ug, smoked] "The lack of mind-fuck makes it easier to deal with how incredibly high I instantly get when I freebase it. The visuals are amazing and I've only just scratched the surface. The body high is excellent and very smooth, no jitters that I've notice or anyone I've shared this with. It may not give me any insights or spiritual awakenings, but if I we're really being honest, most of us I think are really after exactly what this chem offers." -- [Exp 95033](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=95033)
 
[3750 ug, sublingual] "[T]he visuals were basically tangible. I could wave my hand in the air and felt as if I was playing with the energy surrounding me, it was absolute nirvana. I remember thinking to myself what a success the blotters had been, as I was laying in my bed in complete darkness staring at my hand, but having the best time of my life. A lot of the visuals consisted of infinite numbers of random shapes, all very reminiscent of the Matrix coding, just much more colorful and happy feeling. There were also massive amounts of trailing, I could wave my hand around in the air creating the most beautiful disturbances in the fields of energy all around me. It was like when you splash in the water and create all the ripples, except this was just air. Everything I would do in the world was just so beautiful, I thought to myself I couldn't believe I was surrounded by this beauty all day everyday, I just have to remind myself it's there even when I can't see it. I can't describe enough how interactive these visuals are, it's seriously unreal." -- [Exp 93644](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=93644)
 
[1000 ug, sublingual] "I loved how easy the comedown was. When I layed down, I was expecting the constant chatter/closed eye visuals I usually get, but my thinking was clear and it was pretty easy for me to fall asleep." -- [Exp 94200](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=94200)
 
[2 blotter hits, buccal, 2 lines, insufflated] "Wow! visuals are crazy and the music is intense, waves of 3D objects have taken over my living room and everything looks beautiful! [...] Amazing party drug! I don't feel very stimulated even though this is a psychedelic stimulant? But euphoria I feel quite allot and this is a really social drug although on high doses its a bit hard to have a real conversation." -- [Exp 95008](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=95008)
 
[1 blotter hit, sublingual/buccal] "25I is probably the most stereotypical/recreational psychedelic drug I have ever used, and I've used quite a few psychedelics. 25I makes me feel good, I have insane visuals, and it doesn't disrupt with my language abilities (that much). It is almost nothing like 2C-I. Just because it has a 16x greater potency for the 5-HT2a receptor DOES NOT mean that this compound is just a 16x more potent version of 2C-I. In my opinion, 25I was more comparable to LSD/shrooms, than any phenethylamine I have used. However, despite its high recreational value, I do not consider this drug profound on the level of shrooms, Ayahuasca, or salvia." -- [Exp 93884](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=93884)
 
[1500 ug, buccal] "CEV strong, really strong. Abrupt changes in ambient lighting cause rapid strobing. Strong erotic component to music, something in it and the feel of the rug and the sensation was really pushing me close to ecstasy a minute ago." -- [Exp 93870](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=93870)
 
[1000 ug, insufflated] "There's a HEAVY sexual pull which I've yet to read about in other trip reports [...] I feel indescribable pleasure. Bliss. Nirvana. This is the ultimate human experience. My life up until this point has merely been preparation for this moment. Everything from here on afterwards will never be the same. I literally FEEL the beauty of the universe in its infinite complexity. My perception of myself is erased. There is no longer a 'me'. [...] This is one of the best if not THE BEST drug ever made. It would be almost impossible to improve. I am done searching for the perfect psychedelic; this is the one. Both low and high doses are extremely comfortable and get more rewarding as the dosage is pushed higher. Under its influence at relatively high doses there was no nausea, no anxiousness, and absolutely no fear." -- [Exp 95009](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=95009)
 
[2000 ug, insufflated] "[T]he visuals totally absorbed my consciousness. Every moment would be "Oh my god! Why are there some many people roaming the woods?" or "SHIT, the ground is splitting open!". The path would seem to wind away into the sky or my friends would seem to be sucked into the ground. Everything including the trees, bushes, sky, and water would melt together to create one single image. [...] Almost every shadow I saw would turn into the image of a human, and artificial source of light would look like an eye. I started hearing people talk to me, feeling animals perch on my shoulder. Basically I just started hallucinating a bunch of things for no reason at all." -- [Exp 92752](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=92752)
 
[1mg, buccal] "The closed eye visuals were calming, expansive, and beautiful. Many of the images reminded me of some drawings of animals by Native Americans. [...] As I sent it, memories of my childhood with her flashed through my mind, and I felt an enormous sadness thinking about how sad I imagine she felt when I left home for college. I cried for a good minute or two, and it felt wonderful." -- [Exp 95147](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=95147)
 
[5 blotter hits, buccal] "My body felt like shit. I wasn't sure if I was going to shit or puke myself all over the couch or wherever I was. [...] In the meantime I could barely move, I felt like I had drank an entire bottle of vodka. But everything around me had gone to absolute crazy town. I mean, I completely lost sanity. There was no coherent theme, there was nothing to keep track of, everything just went absolutely fucking haywire bananas, there was no reality, just crazy morphing walls and images popping into and out of vision a bazillion times a second." -- [Exp 94045](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=94045)
 
[1500 mcg, sublingual] "I saw rainbow prisms coming off of every object - similar to looking at a streetlight at night, but in broad daylight. I also had a significant "disco ball" effect - small spots of light on every surface." -- [Exp 93624](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=93624)

**Sublingual/Buccal**
- Threshold: 50 - 250 ug (micrograms)
- Light: 200 - 600 ug
- Common: 500 - 800 ug
- Strong: 700 - 1500 ug

- Strong: 700 - 1500 ug
 
 
2C-I-NBOMe is most commonly found in powder form, but is also mixed into liquid as well as dropped onto blotter paper (due to its extremely low doses). An additional complication is that some 2C-I-NBOMe is sold as freebase, some as HCl, and some as pre-"complexed" material that is mixed with a substance (HPBCD) designed to make 2C-I-NBOMe more soluble in water and therefore bioavailable. These different forms will all have different total masses per active dose. 
 
 Because of the different forms available, some pre-dosed onto blotter, it is difficult to provide consistent dosage information.
 
NOTES #
 
Due to its potency, misjudging the dose of 2C-I-NBOMe carries very real risks. A substantial dosage error could lead to undesirable or dangerous effects. If 2C-I-NBOMe is in pure powder form, small breezes, accidental inhalation, or touching the eyes or mouth after handling could result in full-blown effects or dangerous overdoses. Because of these dangers, 2C-I-NBOMe powder should be labeled clearly and handled with laboratory methods (goggles, gloves, mask) to minimize risks.
 
CAUTION & DISCLAIMER #
 
Every individual reacts differently to every chemical. 
 
 Erowid's dosage information is a summary of data gathered from users, research, and other resources. This information is intended to describe the range of dosages people report using. It should not be construed as a recommendation of any sort. Individuals can respond very differently to the same dosage. What is safe for one can be deadly for another.

25I-NBOMe
 
Legal Status
 
by Erowid
 
U.S. FEDERAL LAW #
 
Caution : All legal information should be verified through other sources. [ see below ]
 
**U.S. FEDERAL LEGAL SUMMARY**
**NBOMe Series**
- REGULATED: Yes
- STATUS: Scheduled
- SCHEDULE: I
 
25-I-NBOMe was permanently added to Schedule I effective October 27, 2016, after three years of temporary scheduling that began on November 13, 2013. See [DEA Federal Register: Placement of Three Synthetic Phenethylamines Into Schedule I](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/09/27/2016-23185/schedules-of-controlled-substances-placement-of-three-synthetic-phenethylamines-into-schedule-i) . 
[ show old text ] 
On Nov 13, 2015, the DEA extended the emergency scheduling of 25I-, 25C-, and 25B-NBOMe by one year, until Nov 2016. 
 
 On Nov 15, 2013, the DEA added 25I-, 25C-, and 25B-NBOMe to Schedule I using their emergency scheduling powers, making those NBOMe compounds "temporarily" in Schedule I for two years. It is nearly guaranteed that after two years, these will be permanently added to Schedule I. Having these three chemicals in Schedule I also makes the rest of the NBOMe series probable [Controlled Substance Analogues](https://erowid.org/psychoactives/law/analog/analog.shtml) when intended for human consumption. For these three compounds sales, possession, manufacture, and distribution are all crimes under US law. 
 
 In June 2013, Erowid was contacted by an individual saying they were being prosecuted under the Analogue Act for distribution of 25I-NBOMe (unconfirmed). In mid 2013, there was an ongoing federal case in the U.S. by the Department of Homeland Security attempting to prosecute 25I-NBOMe under the federal analog act. [erowid private correspondence with defendant] 
 
 An informal evaluation by Robert Block of Wisconsin's Controlled Substances Board in September 2011 stated that he believed 25I-NBOMe to qualify as an analog of 2C-I (a Schedule I controlled substance in Wisconsin). "I would like to first make clear that all statements made to your questions are 'MY' opinion and I am neither speaking on behalf of the Wisconsin Crime Laboratories or the Controlled Substances Board (I am the current Chair of CSB). [...] It is my opinion that 25I-NBOMe would qualify as an analog of 2C-I [...]." See [drl.wi.gov/board_docview.asp?docid=247&boardid=12&locid=0](http://drl.wi.gov/board_docview.asp?docid=247&boardid=12&locid=0) . 
 
 One technical note about 25-*-NBOMe legal status: The primary (easiest) synthetic route for producing 25I-, 25C-, and 25B-NBOMe uses the related controlled substance (2C-I, 2C-C, and 2C-B, respectively) as the precursor chemical. It is likely that NBOMe-compounds sourced from lower-end sources might also contain tiny, detectable amounts of these controlled substance.
 
U.S. STATE LAW #
 
Although not unique to NBOMe-type compounds, individuals have been charged with crimes (and in [at least one case, convicted](http://www.starnewsonline.com/article/20130923/ARTICLES/130929877/1177?p=2&tc=pg) ) for being present when someone else has died after taking an NBOMe. In the death of Stephanie Hobson, her boyfriend plead guilty to involuntary manslaughter after she died and he had failed to immediately call 911 for medical assisstance in the state of North Carolina. In another case, the husband of [Renee Honaker](https://erowid.org/chemicals/nbome/nbome_death.shtml#2013-honaker) was charged with murder after she took a piece of blotter they believed to contain LSD and subsequently died.

It is strongly discouraged to take large amounts of this substance or to [insufflate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Routes_of_administration#Insufflation) (snort) it. Please see [this section](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25I-NBOMe#Toxicity_and_harm_potential) for more details.
**25I-NBOMe** (also known as **2C-I-NBOMe** , **NBOMe-2C-I** , **Cimbi-5** , **Smiles** , and one of many drugs referred to as **N-Bomb** ) is a novel [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) substance of the [phenethylamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamine) chemical class that produces an array of visually-dominant and stimulating [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) effects when [administered](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Routes_of_administration) .

The name 25I-NBOMe, which short-hand for 2C-I-NBOMe, is a derivative of the phenethylamine psychedelic [2C-I](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-I) . It was first synthesized and documented in 2003 by Ralf Heim at the Free University of Berlin. It was further researched by a team at Purdue University led by [David Nichols](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/David_E._Nichols) . It has been studied in its 11C radiolabelled form as a potential ligand for mapping the distribution of 5-HT2A receptors in the brain, using positron emission tomography (PET).

It is worth noting that compounds of the [NBOMe](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25x-NBOMe) family (any of which could be referred to as "N-Bomb", especially 25I-NBOMe and [25N-NBOMe](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25N-NBOMe) ) should be administered [sublingually](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sublingual) by placing and holding it into one's mouth and allowing it to absorb over a period of 15-25 minutes.

Extremely little is known about the pharmacological properties, metabolism, and toxicity of 25I-NBOMe in humans. It had no history of human use before being sold online as a [designer drug](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Designer_drug) in 2010. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] . It has been associated with many deaths and hospitalizations. Anecdotal reports suggest that this substance may be difficult to use safely due to its highly sensitive dose-response and unpredictable effects.

## Chemistry

25I-NBOMe or 2C-I-NBOMe is a serotonergic N-benzyl derivative of the substituted phenethylamine psychedelic known as [2C-I](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-I) . 25I-NBOMe is a substituted phenethylamine with methoxy groups CH 3 O- attached to carbons R 2 and R 5 as well as an iodine atom attached to carbon R 4 . It differs from [2C-I](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-I) structurally through a substitution on the amine (NH2) with a 2-methoxybenzyl (BOMe) group. 25I-NBOMe shares this 2-methoxybenzyl substitution with other chemicals of the NBOMe family. This NBOMe addition contains a methoxy ether CH 3 O- bound to a benzene ring at R 2 .

## Pharmacology

25I-NBOMe has efficacy at the [5-HT2A receptor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin#The_5-HT_system) where it acts as a Full [agonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist#Agonists) . However, the role of these interactions and how they result in the [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) experience continues to remain elusive.

Among psychedelics, this compound is considered to be pharmacologically unique in terms of the high potency, affinity, and selectivity with which it binds to the 5-HT2a receptor. Contrary to popular belief, it is not a "full agonist" [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] , although questions have been raised about how the effects it produces differ from other 5-HT2a partial agonists, which include the range of traditional psychedelics.

The Ki values of the following targets were greater than 500 Ki: 5-HT1A, D3, H2, 5-HT1D, α1A adrenergic, δ opioid, serotonin reuptake transporter, 5-HT5A, 5-HT1B, D2, 5-HT7, D1, 5-HT3, 5-HT1E, D5, muscarinic M1-M5, H3, and the dopamine reuptake transporter.

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)** - In terms of its effects on the physical energy levels of the user, 25I-NBOMe is usually considered to be very energetic and stimulating. For most people, this substance induces a unique type of physical stimulation which can be described as feeling extremely energetic but in a way which does not force the tripper to move unless they genuinely choose to do so. For others, however, the stimulation can be quite uncontrollable, occasionally resulting in bodily shakes and a grinding of the teeth comparable to that of [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) and traditional stimulants such as [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) .
- **[Perception of bodily lightness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perception_of_bodily_lightness)** - In terms of the body’s perceived weight, this substance consistently leaves people feeling extremely light, often to the point of total weightlessness.
- **[Spontaneous physical sensations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_physical_sensations)** - The "body high" itself can be described as a mild, all-encompassing, soft but euphoric tingling sensation. This tingling sensation is also accompanied by spontaneous rushes of [euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria) that become longer and more drawn out proportional to the dosage consumed.
- **[Mouth numbing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mouth_numbing)** - Assuming the substance has been taken [sublingually](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sublingual) , the very first physical effect which a person will notice immediately after sublingual absorption is a strong, unpleasant metallic chemical taste. This is accompanied by a very distinct feeling of general numbness of the tongue and mouth which can stay for up to an hour after the blotter paper has been consumed.
- **[Nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea)** - As the user begins to come up, nausea is not uncommon and can sometimes result in initial vomiting, although nausea usually disappears when the user has vomited or the trip fully set in. In comparison to other psychedelics such as [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) , [2C-E](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-E) and [2C-I](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-I) , this could actually be considered very mild in its intensity.
- **[Temperature regulation suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Temperature_regulation_suppression)** 
- **[Increased bodily temperature](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_bodily_temperature)**

- **[Headaches](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Headaches)**
- **[Seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures)** - This effect is far more common in doses exceeding a heavy dose and may manifest as status epilepticus wherein seizures last more than 5 minutes or do not stop without medical intervention
- **[Rhabdomyolysis](/w/index.php?title=Rhabdomyolysis&action=edit&redlink=1)** ### Visual effects
 
- #### Enhancements
 
- **[Visual acuity enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_acuity_enhancement)**
- **[Colour enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_enhancement)**
- **[Pattern recognition enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition_enhancement)**
- **[Magnification](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Magnification)** - At higher doses, users can experience a "fish-eye" effect, where magnification changes based on the direction the user is looking relative to the object.
 
#### Suppressions
 
- **[Frame rate suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Frame_rate_suppression)**
- **[Peripheral information misinterpretation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Peripheral_information_misinterpretation)**
 
#### Distortions
 
- **[Drifting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting)** *( [melting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Melting) , [flowing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Flowing) , [breathing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Breathing) and [morphing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#_morphing) )* - In comparison to other psychedelics, this effect can be described as highly detailed, slow and smooth in motion, static in appearance and unrealistic/cartoon-like in style.
- **[Colour shifting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_shifting)**

- **[Scenery slicing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenery_slicing)**
 
#### Geometry
 
The visual geometry produced by this substance is similar to [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) and can be comprehensively described as algorithmic in geometric style, intricate in complexity, fine and zoomed out in detail, fast and smooth in motion, structured in shape, colorful in scheme, glossy in color, sharp around the edges and equally angular as well as rounded across their corners. In comparison to other more commonly used psychedelics they can be described as significantly more intricate than the visual geometry found within [2C-I](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-I) and most of the [2C-x](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-x) family in general as well as completely on par with [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) , [Psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) and [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT) at appropriately high dosages.
 
25I-NBOMe’s geometry leads reliably leads to [Level 8A](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/8A_Geometry) visual geometry with [Level 8B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Level_8B) remaining so far unconfirmed. It seems to consistently be able to build up in visual intensity when the user stares at a central point. This eventually envelops the visual field and creates the sensation that the tripper has broken through into a continuously shifting geometric landscape or structure with a vast sense of immersive physical size attributed to it.
 
#### Hallucinatory states
 
25I-NBOMe is capable of producing a full range of hallucinatory states within the level 1 - 3 range extremely consistently. However, level 4 hallucinatory breakthroughs are reported but very different and inconsistent in comparison to other more commonly used psychedelics such as [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) , [2C-E](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-E) and [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT) .
 
These effects include:
 
- **[Transformations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Transformations)**
- **[Machinescapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Machinescapes)** - This component is an uncommon effect that typically only occurs at very strong to heavy doses. It also tends to be accompanied by overwhelming if not dangerous physical and cognitive effects.
- **[Internal hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucination)** - ( *[settings, sceneries, and landscapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Settings,_sceneries,_and_landscapes)* ; *[perspective hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perspective_hallucinations)* and *[scenarios and plots](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenarios_and_plots)* ). These are more common within dark environments and can be described as lucid in believability, interactive in style and almost exclusively of a personal, religious, spiritual, science-fiction, fantasy, surreal, nonsensical or transcendental nature in their overall theme. ### Cognitive effects
 
- The cognitive effects of 25I-NBOMe are described by many as notably light in comparison to the classical [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) . It is not uncommon for people to report feeling that their thought stream has maintained general normality in its specific style throughout low to moderate dosages. At high dosages, however, strong to overwhelming cognitive alterations become present, which can lead to states of [confusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Confusion) , [amnesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amnesia) , and general sensory overload. The most prominent of these cognitive effects generally include: 
- **[Analysis enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Analysis_enhancement)** - This effect is generally only present at low doses.
- **[Thought acceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_acceleration)** and **[Thought deceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_deceleration)** - Although one of 25i-NBOME's effects is thought acceleration, the opposite may occur at higher doses.
- **[Conceptual thinking](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Conceptual_thinking)** - This effect is considered to be very mild compared to traditional psychedlics.
- **[Anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety)** & **[Paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia)** - This effect seems to occur more readily than other psychedelics, perhaps due to its very prominent stimulating properties 
- **[Feelings of impending doom](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Feelings_of_impending_doom)** - This is generally only experienced during the comedown period or if one has taken a large amount of the substance.
- **[Empathy, affection, and sociability enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Empathy,_affection,_and_sociability_enhancement)** - The [entactogenic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entactogenic) effects range from mild to powerful, but are inconsistently manifested. Entactogenic effects for people who try this substance usually become prominent in the presence of others. These feelings of increased sociability, love and empathy do not seem to be quite as strong or profound as those found within other [entactogens](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entactogen) (such as [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) , [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) and [AMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/AMT) )
- **[Memory suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Memory_suppression)** 
- **[Ego death](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ego_death)**
- **[Amnesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amnesia)**
- **[Novelty enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Novelty_enhancement)**
- **[Immersion enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Immersion_enhancement)**
- **[Emotion enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Emotion_enhancement)**
- **[Increased sense of humor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_sense_of_humor)** 
- **[Laughter fits](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Laughter_fits)**
- **[Increased music appreciation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_music_appreciation)**
- **[Personal bias suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Personal_bias_suppression)**
- **[Increased libido](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_libido)**
- **[Time distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Time_distortion)**
- **[Wakefulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness)**
- **[HPPD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/HPPD)** ### Auditory effects
 
- - **[Enhancements](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_enhancement)**
- **[Distortions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_distortion)**
- **[Hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_hallucinations)** ### Multi-sensory effects
 
- - **[Dosage independent intensity](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dosage_independent_intensity)** - While the reasons for this are not understood, many reports suggest that this substance can produce unexpectedly strong or weak effects even when taken at the seemingly same dose in an unpredictable manner. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] This may contribute to the relative risk it is poses compared to most other psychedelics.
- **[Synaesthesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Synaesthesia)** - In its fullest manifestation, this is a very rare and non-reproducible effect. Increasing the dosage can increase the likelihood of this occurring, but seems to only be a prominent part of the experience among those who are already predisposed to synaesthetic states. ### Transpersonal effects
 
- While they are occasionally reported, the transpersonal effects produced by this substance seem to be significantly less consistent and reproducible than other [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) , which perhaps corresponds with the notably mild changes to one's perceptual and cognitive processes. 
- **[Existential self-realization](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Existential_self-realization)**
- **[Unity and interconnectedness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Unity_and_interconnectedness)**

## Toxicity and harm potential

**Short-term as well as long-term damage of NBOMes have been occasionally tied to serious physical and mental problems on seemingly random people, including memory and speech difficulties, heart problems, HPPD and in some cases Anxiety and PTSD, from particularly difficult experiences.**

25I-NBOMe is a relatively new substance, and little is known about its pharmacological risks or its interaction with other substances. The [LD50](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LD50) has not yet been determined although it is potentially fatal at heavy dosages. [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) advises that due to 25I-NBOMe's extreme potency it should not be insufflated as this method of administration appears to have led to several deaths in the past year.

This substance came to media attention in early 2012 after a cluster of seven non-fatal [overdoses](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Overdose) with the drug were reported in or around Richmond, Virginia. As of May 2013, 25I-NBOMe has reportedly led to five overdose deaths in the United States. In June 2012, two teens in Grand Forks, North Dakota and East Grand Forks, Minnesota fatally overdosed on a substance that was allegedly 25I-NBOMe, resulting in lengthy sentences for two of the parties involved and a Federal indictment against the Texas-based online vendor.

A 21-year-old man from Little Rock, Arkansas died in October 2012 after taking a liquid drop of the drug nasally at a music festival. He was reported to have consumed caffeinated alcoholic beverages for "several hours" beforehand. It is unclear what other drugs he may have consumed, as autopsies usually do not test for the presence of research chemicals.

A man in Australia died from injuries sustained by running into trees and power poles while intoxicated by 25I-NBOMe.

A Brazilian 16-year-old died from overdose in April 2016. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

The addition of 5-HTP can greatly increase the effects of 25i-NBOME and should be avoided. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this substance.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

25I-NBOMe is not habit-forming and the desire to use it can actually decrease with use. It is most often self-regulating.

Tolerance to the effects of 25I-NBOMe is built almost immediately after ingestion. After that, it takes about 1 week for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 2 weeks to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). 25I-NBOMe presents cross-tolerance with all [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) , meaning that after the consumption of 25I-NBOMe all psychedelics will have a reduced effect.

### Overdose

Due to the very high potency and seemingly unpredictable effects the margin between a normal and an overdose of NBOMe compounds is extremely small when compared to many other substances. The exact toxic dose is unclear since it seems to depend a lot on personal physiology, rather than predominantly dose. However, various anecdotal reports suggest that dangerous side effects begin to appear when exceeding 1000 μg and it possibly becoming lethal for the more sensitive people at roughly 2000 μg. Reports of other people surviving much higher doses, sometimes even without any major side effects have been documented as well.

There is also the uncertainty of dosage on blotter paper since it is rather difficult to lay such an exact dosage. Insufflating, vaporizing or drinking tinctures of this substance is highly discouraged because of this and has been tied to many documented deaths . One study found that 25I‐NBOMe and 25C‐NBOMe blotter papers contained 'hotspots' with higher quantities of the drug, implying an inherent risk of overdosing.

The overdose effects of NBOMes are typically a dangerously high [heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate) , [blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure) , [hyperthermia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hyperthermia) and significant [vasoconstriction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction) also accompanied by [confusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Confusion) , [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attack) , aggressive behavior, [numbness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_suppression) or pain, [amnesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amnesia) and often [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizure) . The risks in an overdose include anything from organ failure to cardiac arrest and death [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] . There are also multiple reports of people lethally injuring themselves or falling to death . [Benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) or [antipsychotics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antipsychotics) can help with the psychological effects during an overdose although medical attention should always be called in even a possible overdose of 25I-NBOMe.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .* Due to the highly unpredictable nature of the NBOMe series, it is generally advised to avoid mixing them with other psychoactive substances.

- **2C-T-X** - The 2C-T-X phenethylamines can be unpredictable in their interactions and the NBOMes are known to be unpredictable even alone. As a result, this combination should be avoided.
- **5-MeO-xxt** - The 5-MeO tryptamines can be unpredictable in their interactions and the NBOMes are known to be unpredictable even alone. As a result, this combination should be avoided.
- **Amphetamines** - Amphetamines and NBOMes both provide considerable stimulation. When combined they can result in tachycardia, hypertension, vasoconstriction and, in extreme cases, heart failure. The anxiogenic and focusing effects of stimulants are also not good in combination with psychedelics as they can lead to unpleasant thought loops. NBOMes are known to cause seizures and stimulants can increase this risk.
- **aMT**
- **Caffeine** - Caffeine can bring out the natural stimulation from psychedelic drugs to make it uncomfortable. High doses can cause anxiety which is hard to handle while tripping.
- **Cannabis** - Cannabis has an unexpectedly strong and unpredictable synergy with the effects of psychedelics. Caution is advised with this combination as it can significantly increase the risk of adverse psychological reactions like [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) , and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) . Users are advised to start off with only a fraction of their normal cannabis dose and take long breaks between hits to avoid over intake.
- **Cocaine** - Cocaine and NBOMes both provide considerable stimulation. When combined they can result in severe vasoconstriction, tachycardia, hypertension, and in extreme cases heart failure.
- **DOx**
- **DXM**
- **[Lithium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_(medication))** [- Lithium is commonly prescribed in the treatment of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder bipolar disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_(medication)) . There is a large body of anecdotal evidence that suggests taking it with psychedelics significantly increases the risk of [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) and [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) . As a result, this combination is strictly discouraged.
- **MAOIs** - MAO-B inhibitors can increase the potency and duration of phenethylamines unpredictably.
- **MDMA**

25I-NBOMe is a psychedelic phenethylamine. It’s a potent drug with a low safety ratio, so it’s easier to encounter dangerous effects compared to LSD or psilocin.

Because it has received a lot of negative coverage in the media and has caused multiple fatalities, 25I-NBOMe doesn’t have a good reputation. Nevertheless, it’s typically safe at common doses and some people enjoy its effects.

When using strong+ doses, it may be more likely to cause confusion and be overwhelming than other psychedelics. It could also contribute to HPPD at a somewhat higher rate.

The substance was synthesized in the early 2000s, but it didn’t enter the recreational market until 2010.

Usually it’s sold on blotter paper, but it has also been sold as a powder and liquid.

PubChem: [10251906](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/10251906)

Molecular formula: C18H22INO3

Molecular weight: 427.282 g/mol

IUPAC: 2-(4-iodo-2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-N-[(2-methoxyphenyl)methyl]ethanamine

---

## Dose

#### Buccal & Sublingual

Light: 300 – 500 μg

Common: 500 – 800 μg

Strong: 800 – 1000 μg

#### Intranasal (tentative; not recommended)

Light: 200 – 400 μg

Common: 400 – 700 μg

Strong: 700 – 900 μg

Blotters typically range in concentration from 500 μg to 1500 μg. There can be a bit of variation in their content and you can’t necessarily trust the dosing a seller claims. As such, this is not a drug where more than one blotter should ever be taken. Typically a single blotter won’t be dangerous for an otherwise healthy person. While 2-3 blotters could conceivably be fatal, depending on the concentration.

Due to its high potency, you should avoid any intranasal use.

Onset: 00:30 – 01:30

#### Intranasal (tentative; not recommended)

Total: 5 – 7 hours

Onset: 00:05 – 00:10

## Experience Reports

[Erowid](https://erowid.org/experiences/subs/exp_25INBOMe.shtml)

---

---

## Effects

#### Positive

- OEVs and CEVs
- Auditory hallucinations
- Euphoria
- Mood lift
- Stimulation – [It’s a more stimulating, energetic psychedelic. Though people can often remain seated without issue and the stimulation doesn’t negatively impact the experience.]
- Some entactogen, pro-social, or pro-empathy qualities – [These effects aren’t consistently provided, but you may notice pro-social and pro-empathy effects, especially when surrounded by other people.]
- Increased creativity
- Music enhancement

#### Negative

- Confusion
- Agitation
- Panic and anxiety
- Fear
- Nausea
- Thought loops
- Increased heart rate
- Increased blood pressure
- Vasoconstriction – [Leading to peripheral numbness and coldness.]
- Muscle tension

25I-NBOMe is a little shorter-acting than LSD, but it lasts longer than psilocin and 2C-B.

#### Perception

The visual effects are often pretty intense and can be compared to LSD overall. Dose-for-dose, it may offer more visual activity than LSD.

Significant distortions of your surroundings, trailing, fractals, geometric, and more vibrant colors are all possible.

Some people claim 25I-NBOMe’s visuals are less “natural” than those from the classic psychedelics. Not everyone reports this, however, and it’s not clear how real the difference is. It’s possible users feel that way in cases where the visual effects are prominent but the drug is lacking a strong psychedelic headspace (e.g. introspection and profoundness.)

The perceptual changes aren’t limited to the visual domain. It can also cause auditory distortions, tactile sensations, and smell changes. Synesthesia is possible.

#### Mental effects

Experience reports for 25I-NBOMe span the range from bliss and introspection to terror and confusion. If you stick to a common dose, it can be a fairly clear-headed psychedelic. Whereas using a strong+ dose could significantly increase the chance of confusion and even delirium.

People sometimes report strong mental effects even in the common dose range. There will be differences between individuals and even between experiences.

When confusion is present, it can present with thought loops and an inability to complete basic tasks.

Because there are reports of both strong mental activity and clear-headedness at common doses, it’s difficult to determine what the “average” 25I-NBOMe experience is like.

At strong+ doses, confusion is a much more frequent issue. You should avoid higher doses even just for that reason.

Delirium can develop when enough is used. Delirious states can be dangerous for users and those nearby. Sometimes those states are accompanied by aggression and agitation.

People have put themselves in harm’s way and even engaged in self-harm while frightened and confused because of the drug. You can reduce the chance of those negatives by using a common amount.

Occasionally people like the stronger mental activity that’s offered with high doses. It can facilitate personal insight and ego loss, for example. But if you want to explore more intense mental states, it’s best to do so with psychedelics that are physically safer.

Pleasantness

There are highly variable reports about how pleasant the experience is. This is to be expected with any psychedelic, but 25I-NBOMe might be overwhelming and dysphoric at a somewhat higher rate.

Despite that, many users report quite enjoyable and even beneficial psychedelic experiences. It can offer significant visual changes and a profound mental state, similar to LSD or psilocybin. Some users also find it can be euphoric in an LSD-like way.

It’s one of the more euphoric and mood-enhancing drugs in the NBOMe series, according to some user reports.

#### Negatives

Vasoconstriction is quite common. It can result in coldness and numbness, particularly in the extremities. This normally isn’t dangerous at common doses.

Muscle tension and aches are also reported fairly often.

And 25I-NBOMe can result in nausea, a generally uncomfortable tenseness and feeling of apprehension, and urinary retention (though sometimes increased urination.)

On the mental side, the greatest negatives are confusion and anxiety.

## Chemistry & Pharmacology

#### Chemistry

25I-NBOMe is a substituted phenethylamine and a derivative of 2C-I.

Compared to 2C-I, it’s further substituted at the Nitrogen with a 2-methoxybenzyl moiety. That addition provides a higher 5-HT2A affinity and potency.

The NBOMe name for 25I and other members of that series comes from the **N-B** enzylmethoxy moiety and **OMe** (methoxy).

There are several other NBOMe derivatives where the iodine is replaced with bromine, chlorine, hydrogen, methyl, ethyl, or other substitutions. Those changes yield drugs like 25B-NBOMe, 25C-NBOMe, 25H-NBOMe, 25D-NBOMe, 25N-NBOMe, 25iP-NBOMe, and 25E-NBOMe.

N-benzyl substitutions

(Glennon, 1994) first reported on the impact of N-benzyl substitutions for phenethylamine hallucinogens with 25B-NB, a derivative of 2C-B. It was found to have a higher binding affinity than the parent drug.

It’s hypothesized the N-benzyl moiety is useful in 5-HT2A binding since the benzyl is stabilized by aromatic stacking with Phe339 in transmembrane domain 6 (TM6). Mutating Phe339 typically doesn’t impair the affinity of 5-HT2A agonists, yet it’s been found to negatively impact the activity of 25I-NBOMe and related compounds.

David Nichols’ team has found N-benzyl substitution consistently increases phenethylamine hallucinogen affinity. Though it has a greater impact if the parent compound is weaker.

For example, 2C-H receives a greater affinity boost from the substitution than 2C-I.

N-benzyl substitution paired with an oxygenated ortho position substitution can further increase 5-HT2A affinity. For example, 25I-NBOMe, 25I-NBOH, and 25I-NBMD have a higher affinity than 25H-NB.

#### Pharmacology

Many assays have consistently found it has a low nanomolar (nM) affinity for 5-HT2A. Functional studies suggest it has nearly full agonist properties, at least for phosphoinositide hydrolysis (the PLC-IP pathway). Most of the studies find it’s a relatively high activity partial agonist, though some have found it’s a lower-activity partial agonist.

When tested in vascular assays (e.g. rat tail artery), it was initially found to be a partial agonist. This was based on the extent of vasoconstriction, which was 30% of that from serotonin.

HTR

Animal studies have shown 25I-NBOMe produces a robust and potent head-twitch response in mice, which fits with the hallucinogenic activity seen in humans. This activity is antagonized by volinanserin, a 5-HT2A antagonist.

In this model, it was about 10-fold more potent than 2C-I, but a little less potent than LSD.

(Hanks, 2013)

- Induces the head twitch response (HTR) in mice in a dose-dependent manner.
- 0.01 mg/kg (SC) leads to a significant HTR.
- The ED50 is: 0.078 mg/kg. 
- That means it’s around 14-fold more potent than 2C-I.

Functional selectivity

Some have hypothesized 25I-NBOMe could preferentially activate the PLA2-AA pathway at the 5-HT2A receptor. This could promote prostaglandin formation, thromboxane a2 formation, and inflammation.

This hasn’t been verified and the efficacy studies have generally shown high intrinsic activity based on the PLC pathway.

We also still don’t really understand how the PLA2-AA and PLC-IP properties of a given drug impact its body-wide activity. Nor do we fully understand how other signalling pathways at 5-HT2A contribute to the properties of various psychedelics.

Studies on functional selectivity have shown the parent drug, 2C-I, is somewhat biased towards IP accumulation over AA release. Other psychedelics can have quite different profiles. For example, DOI is a classic example of a high AA release psychedelic and 2C-N only seems to trigger the PLA2-AA pathway.

Clearly there’s a cause of 25I-NBOMe’s low safety ratio, but we don’t know what it is.

- Author interpretation 
- N-2-methoxybenzyl substitution raises the binding affinity and/or activation potency at 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, 5-HT2C, and adrenergic a1a receptors. 
- But it lowers the binding at 5-HT1A and TAAR1.
- Receptor activation efficacy was decreased by the substitution.
- The selectivity for 2A vs. 1A was also increased, which could lead to greater effects since 5-HT1A activation seems to inhibit psychedelic activity.
- NBOMe drugs also bind to adrenergic a1 receptors, which could lead to stimulation at higher doses.

**Other receptors**

As you can see from the above results, 5-HT2B and 5-HT2C binding appear to exist and it operates as an agonist.

Binding data from the PDSP (antagonist assays) as reported in (Ettrup, 2010)

- 5-HT2A: 2.2 nM
- 5-HT2B: 2.3 nM
- 5-HT2C: 7.0 nM
- 5-HT6: 58 nM
- 5-HT1A: 85 nM
- D3: 117 nM
- A2C adrenergic: 348 nM
- D4: 647 nM
- Everything else is over 1 uM

The PDSP data reported in (Ettrup, 2010) shows it has the highest affinity for 5-HT2A and a similar affinity for 5-HT2B. It has a 3-fold lower affinity for 5-HT2C than 5-HT2A, based on those results. Other receptors generally show much weaker binding.

Overall, we have the most evidence for relatively selective 5-HT2A agonism. Beyond that, some of the results are conflicting. (Rickli, 2015) seems to stand apart from the other papers when it comes to the degree of intrinsic activity. Most papers support the idea that 25I-NBOMe is a high activity partial agonist, with around 80-90% activity relative to serotonin (the endogenous agonist.)

**Other research**

(Ettrup, 2010) – Ex vivo distribution research in rats found 25I-NBOMe uptake was greatest in the frontal cortex, moderate in striatal and thalamic regions, and low in the cerebellum.

A lipophilic metabolic was found to account for ~20% of the total plasma radioactivity, but it was only found in negligible amounts in pig brain vs. plasma.

(Catlow, 2013) – Impact on neurogenesis.

- Injections of 25I-NBOMe at 0.1, 0.3, and 1 mg/kg 
- Led to a significant decline in the number of surviving BrdU+ neurons and BrdU/NeuN+ neurons in the hippocampus.
- Whereas psilocybin caused a trend towards increased neurogenesis.

(Halberstadt, 2017) – Reporting on other animal results

- 25I-NBOMe produces similar locomotor effects to those seen with other phenethylamine hallucinogens.
- 0.1 mg/kg will increase locomotor activity, while 3 mg/kg decreases it.

(Braden, 2006) – Investigation of the importance of specific amino acid residues in 5-HT2A

- In vitro tests using wild type and mutant human 5-HT2A receptor cell lines as well as NIH-3T3 cells expressing rat 5-HT2A
- Found the N-benzyl group led to significant increase in potency and affinity at r5-HT2A
- The N-benzyl analogs have their binding significantly affected with Phe339(6.51) and Phe340 (6.52) mutations within the human 5-HT2A receptor. 
- Whereas classic ligands are only strongly affected by changes to Phe340(6.52).
- Phe340 mutation doesn’t appear to negatively impact intrinsic activity of 25i-NBOMe, yet it does reduce binding affinity and potency. 
- Therefore, an interaction with Phe339 may be sufficient to produce a fully “active” receptor.
- These amino acid residues (Phe339 and Phe340) are within transmembrane domain 6 (TM6) 
- That’s coupled to the third intracellular loop (IL3), between TM5 and TM6.
- And IL3 is important for the ability of the receptor to interact with and activate the appropriate G proteins and therefore impact second messenger production.

(Gomez-Jeria, 2015) – Molecular docking study using a model of the 5-HT2A receptor

- Important amino acid residues for 25I-NBOMe docking: 
- Val156 (TMH3), Asp155 (TMH3), Ser159 (TMH3), Ile152 (TMH3), Phe339 (TMH6).
- Only two transmembrane helixes appear involved, TMH3 and TMH6.
- The only interaction common across the psychedelics tests (incl. MDMA, DMT, DOB, LSD, and mescaline) is with Val156.

#### Pharmacokinetics

There’s evidence that demethylation is a primary metabolic route. Some of the drugs produced could have their own activity, such as 2C-I and 25I-NBOH, though the concentrations may be too small.

CYP3A4 is thought to be the primary enzyme involved.

In vitro (human microsomal) evidence shows there is significant intrinsic clearance, which fits with extensive first pass metabolism and insufficient oral bioavailability. Most anecdotal human reports also suggest it’s not readily active when used orally.

Indeed, mice locomotor studies found SC but not IP administration could lead to activity. IP administration exposes the drug to oral-like first pass metabolism.

Given the in vitro and human toxicological data, 2C-I is one of the metabolites. Since 2C-I is much less potent, it’s probably not contributing to the drug’s activity and not enough is produced from oral administration to cause effects. This seems to be a minor metabolic route, although a fairly high 2C-I concentration has sometimes been detected.

The 2- and 5-O-desmethyl derivatives of 25I-NBOMe are rapidly conjugated with glucoronic acid, limiting their systemic exposure and potential human activity.

Papers

(Caspar, 2015)

- Tentatively identified 37 Phase 1 and 31 Phase 2 metabolites in rat urine.
- 2-O-desmethyl-25I-NBOMe, 5-O-desmethyl-25I-NBOMe, 25I-NBOH, and their glucoronic acid conjugates appear to be the primary metabolites.
- A CYP incubation screening involving ten human CYP enzymes indicated: 
- CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 were involved in O-demethylation
- CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 were involved in hydroxylation
- CYP3A4 was involved in N-demethoxybenzylation

(Leth-Peterson)

- Assessed the microsomal stability of NBOMes.
- Found to have much higher clearance rates than the corresponding 2C-x drugs.
- Because 25I-NBOMe clearance (4.1 L/h/kg) exceeds hepatic blood flow (1.2 L/h/kg), extensive first pass metabolism could explain the lack of oral activity.

(Nielsen, 2016)

- In vitro metabolism study using human liver microsomes incubated with CYP enzymes and MAO enzymes.
- Metabolism in this study looking at both 25I-NBOMe and 25I-NBOH was NADPH-dependent
- Intrinsic clearance 
- 4.206 L/h/kg for 25I-NBOMe
- Metabolism was 80-90% inhibited by 1-ABT, a general CYP inhibitor.
- 17 CYP-generated metabolites were identified 
- Formed by hydroxylation, O-demethylation, dehydration, and N-dealkylation.
- Among the metabolites confirmed: 2C-I, 2-O-desmethyl-25I-NBOMe, 5-O-desmethyl-25I-NBOMe, 25I-NBOH, and 4-OH-25I-NBOMe.
- CYP enzymes involved 
- CYP2C19 had the highest activity 
- Full depletion of both drugs during incubation time.
- CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP2C9 were intermediate contributors.
- While CYP3A4 could metabolize 25I-NBOMe, it didn’t metabolize 25I-NBOH.
- None of these were active: MAOA, MAOB, CYP2A6, or CYP2C18. 
- And CYP2C8 and CYP2E1 only led to minor metabolite levels.
- 2C-I formation 
- 2C-I was found from both 25I-NBOMe and 25I-NBOH.
- CYP2C19 had the greatest ability to form 2C-I.
- CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 also formed it.
- CYP3A4 
- Ketoconazole’s partial inhibition of CYP3A4 at 1 uM led to a major reduction in metabolism. 50% of starting compound survived vs. just 2%. 
- When increased to a 5 uM concentration, that increased to 75% of compound remaining.
- After that inhibition, monohydroxylated and O-demethylated metabolites including 2-O-desmethyl-25I-NBOMe were still formed. 
- This fits with them not being formed by CYP3A4 and it shows other CYP enzymes contribute.
- Inhibition of CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 also led to slightly slower metabolism, indicating smaller contribution. 
- CYP2C19 appeared most important of those.
- Author interpretation 
- Primarily metabolized by CYP3A4, but not solely by that route. There’s contribution of CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6.
- CYP3A4 is the most abundant hepatic CYP enzyme and is also found in the gut, so metabolism in the gut could contribute to low oral bioavailability. 
- When coupled with (Leth-Peterson)’s assertion that the high clearance rate exceeds hepatic blood flow, it’s understandable why there’s a lack of oral activity.
- This also suggests CYP3A4 inhibitors might make 25I more dangerous.

(Wohlfarth, 2016)

- Human hepatocytes along with in vivo mouse and human urine data
- Major Phase 1 metabolism: Demethylation, di-demethylation, and hydroxylation. 
- Minor pathway is at the NBOMe ring via N-dealkylation
- Major Phase 2 metabolism: Glucuronidation, though sulfation also occurs.
- Some notable metabolites include: 2- and 5-desmethyl-25I-NBOMe and likely 5-hydroxy-25I-NBOMe

(Poklis, 2015)

- Reviewed other case reports from humans and found the parent drug is usually detected.
- 2C-I and its O-desmethyl metabolites can also sometimes be found.
- Although (Stellpflug) had a case report showing 25H-NBOMe as a urinary metabolite, that may not be a legitimate finding. 
- Poklis found 25H-NBOMe was a trace contaminant in their commercial primary reference material and it’s been identified as an impurity on 25I-NBOMe blotter paper.
- Plus, dehalogenation (such as a loss of an iodine) from an aromatic ring system isn’t known to be a human drug metabolism pathway.
- 2-O-desmethyl-25I-NBOMe and 5-O-desmethyl-25I-NBOMe appear to be the best metabolites to look for in human urine samples. 
- While the third demethylation metabolite, 25I-NBOH, is less abundant.

## History

#### 2003

Ralf Heim at the Free University of Berlin synthesized the drug.

His synthesis involved a reductive alkylation procedure. The starting material was 2C-I, which was reacted with 2-methoxybenzaldehyde.

This produced an imine intermediate, which could be used as a precursor. Then a reducing agent (NaBH4) was used to yield 25I-NBOMe.

#### 2000s

Before it was used in recreational settings, 25I entered scientific study. It has primarily been explored as a tool to investigate the serotonergic system;.

Labelled 25I, namely [11C]25I-NBOMe, has been studied as a radiolabelled tracer for PET imaging.

That work continues to this day, although potentially better tracers have been identified.

#### Late 2000s

David Nichols’ lab at Purdue began investigating 25I-NBOMe and related compounds in the mid- to late-2000s.

They looked at their structure-activity relationships and other qualities of various NBOMe substances.

#### 2010

Internet vendors began selling the NBOMe series and it appears 25I-NBOMe was the first to really enter the market.

It became the most popular member of the series.

#### 2010s

25I has been sold in three primary ways:

- As a “legal” alternative to LSD. [Now outdated due to its scheduling.]
- As itself.
- Misrepresented as LSD.

There’s been a lot of incentive to sell it as LSD or in place of LSD given its lower price point. Particularly when it was legal, it could be obtained for well under \$1 per dose, giving it a higher profit margin.

Some of the misrepresentation has been enabled by the use of blotters, especially in cases where the designs have historically been associated with LSD. People have often been tricked into buying and using 25I-NBOMe blotters.

A large portion of the purchases occurred online, often from dark net vendors or from Chinese vendors. It was also sold on the clearnet for a time. There’s been a lot of re-selling in the real world, often to unsuspecting buyers.

25I-NBOMe was primarily sold in blotter form, though it’s sometimes been found in powder and liquid form.

According to the EMCDDA, 25I blotters are usually pure. But a portion also contain other NBOMe drugs and/or other psychedelics.

It’s possible some of the widespread use was attributable to a large amount of media coverage. Even though the coverage was often negative (i.e. discussing fatalities), it could still increase people’s interest in the substance.

#### 2010s

There has certainly been variation in the contents of NBOMe blotters. Buyers haven’t been able to trust the concentrations stated by sellers.

(Poklis, 2015) – Reported on an analysis of three blotters purchased online pre-late 2013

- Blotters were advertised as having 500 μg of either 25I-NBOMe, 25B-NBOMe, or 25C-NBOMe.
- Obtained through future-labs.eu.
- Results 
- Every blotter’s listed drug was indeed the primary substance, but every blotter also contained some other NBOMe compounds. 
- This suggests impurities are an issue.
- In the case of 25I-NBOMe, these were found at 18 – 29 ug: 25H-NBOMe, 25C-NBOMe, and 25D-NBOMe.
- Dose 
- 510 μg of 25C-NBOMe on that blotter
- 540 μg of 25I-NBOMe on that blotter
- 1500 μg of 25B-NBOMe on that blotter

You can see from the 25B result that blotters may contain significantly more active drug than anticipated.

#### 2010s

European seizure data was compiled by the EMCDDA at the end of 2013. The organization reported that sellers appeared to be based in the EU and China. In some cases they were offering kilograms of the substance.

The drug first showed up in the EU in May 2012. Swedish police identified the substance and reported its presence to the EU Early Warning System in June 2012.

According to a report from the EMCDDA, 14 new substituted phenethylamines were reported to the Early Warning System in 2012. 6/14 were in the NBOMe class.

#### 2010s

Multiple deaths from the substance quickly appeared in North America, Europe, Australia, and other locations.

Between the fatalities, hospital visits, law enforcement seizures, and discussion online, the authorities and the drug-using community learned about the substance in a significant way.

#### October 2011

Russia became the first country to schedule the drug.

#### June 2011 – June 2013

The DEA reported, based on data from nationwide NFLIS labs, 795 cases of 25I-NBOMe being seized. It was typically found in powder or blotter form.

Those reports came from 35 states.

No reports existed prior to June 2011, when 25I was detected in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

#### 2012

Due to there being an outbreak of cases in Virginia, the state placed it in Schedule 1 .

#### 2012

An intoxication case series in the US was presented for the first time at the Annual Meeting of the North American Congress of Clinical Toxicology.

(Kelly) reported a series involving four teenagers in Michigan who ended up in the ED due to 25I-NBOMe use.

The drug had been purchased over the internet. In 3/4 patients it caused seizures. All had tachycardia and agitation. Some of the patients required significant medical treatment.

#### Late 2012

(Lawn, 2014) – Non-representative internet survey of drug users (the Global Drug Survey).

- 22,289 total responses
- 2.6% (n=582) reported using an NBOMe drug 
- 25I was the most popular, accounting for 2% (n=442)
- 25B was the second most popular.
- 81.2% reported using it orally or sublingually/bucally/oral
- 0.8% (n=189) reported using in the last month
- 41.7% reported sourcing from the internet. 
- 39.7% reported from “a friend” and 15.9% reported from a “dealer”
- 95% reported a duration of 3-13 hours, with an average of 6 hours.

#### 2012 – 2013

(Ezquiaga, 2016) – Examining data from samples received by Energy Control, a drug checking service in Spain.

Data was from 2009 to 2015, producing 21,198 samples in total.

- Only 56 contained 25I-NBOMe, all of which were received from 2012 onward. 2013 saw the most reports (n=19).
- Sold as: 
- 42.8% as LSD
- 21.4% as 25I-NBOMe
- 7.1% as 25C-NBOMe
- 7.1% as 25I-NBOMe
- 21.4% as other substances.

#### February 2013 – October 2013

Austria’s drug checking program, Checkit, reported 6 cases of 25I-NBOMe detection.

5 cases involved it being sold as LSD. The other case involved it being sold as mescaline.

#### By 2013

32 non-fatal intoxications were reported to the EU’s Early Warning System. 15/32 were analytically confirmed.

- Belgium (3), Poland (4), Sweden (18), UK (7).

4 deaths were reported, 2 of which were analytically confirmed.

- Belgium (2), Poland (1), UK (1)
- Both analytically confirmed deaths weren’t attributed directly to 25I-NBOMe’s physical effects. 
- Rather, one was “natural causes” and one was “drowning.”
- Behavioral problems could have been responsible for the latter hypothetically.

#### 2013

The DEA reported that from March 2012 to August 2013 there were at least 19 deaths linked to 25I-, 25B-, and 25C-NBOMe.

Those people were aged 15- to 29-years-old.

#### June 2013

Given a temporary scheduled status in the UK.

#### November 2013

Emergency scheduled in the US, effective November 15, 2013.

According to the DEA, US Customs and Border Patrol had seized the drug in the form of bulk powder, often originating from Asia.

#### 2014

As the years have gone on, there have also been instances of people receiving other NBOMe derivatives in place of 25I-NBOMe.

For example, (Laskowski, 2014) reported on two cases where people thought they took 25I-NBOMe, but they actually used 25C-NBOMe or 25B-NBOMe.

This shows an apparent evolution in the NBOMe market.

#### September 2014

25I-NBOMe was the most frequently reported novel psychoactive substance, according to the UN Office on Drugs and Crime.

That data came from 23 countries and territories. 43% of the regions reported the substance.

25I was followed by 25C-NBOMe and methylone. Those were found in 40% each.

#### 2014

(Neto, 2015) – Analyzing the contents of 77 blotters from 27 street apprehensions conducted by local police forces in Minas Gerais, Brazil during 2014.

- 39 blotters from 18 cases contained an NBOMe (25I, 25B, or 25C), representing 50.6% of blotters tested and 66.7% of apprehension cases.
- Indicative of a strong presence of these drugs in the illicit psychedelic market.

#### 2015

The DEA extended its emergency scheduling of the drug by another year.

#### 2016

It became permanently scheduled in the US. 25I was scheduled alongside 25C-NBOMe and 25B-NBOMe.

#### 2017

25I-NBOMe’s overall presence has seemingly declined, likely in part because of its prohibited status. However, it still shows up in the illicit market and users must remain vigilant with testing their drugs.

## Safety

#### Misrepresentation

One of the greatest issues with 25I-NBOMe is that it’s often been sold as LSD or another psychedelic. Because it’s common to take more than one blotter tab when using LSD, people could accidentally overdose on 25I with ease.

There are multiple differences between the drugs that make it relatively easy to avoid accidentally using 25I.

First, 25I blotters have a very bitter or strong chemical taste. LSD blotters can sometimes have a taste, but it’s usually nonexistent or pretty light. If you notice a very strong taste with a blotter, it may be more likely that you actually have a non-LSD drug, such as 25I-NBOMe. In cases where you notice a strong taste, you’re better off removing the blotter from your mouth and getting rid of it.

Taste is an imprecise way of determining what your blotter contains. Therefore, reagent testing is a much better option.

While also imperfect, reagent tests can at least make it significantly less likely that you’ll accidentally use 25I-NBOMe instead of LSD.

One of the best tests to use is the Ehrlich reagent. It’ll yield a purple reaction with LSD, but no reaction with 25I. You can see videos of various reagent test reactions down below.

#### Adverse effects

A typical overdose will include some combination of confusion, agitation, hallucinations, tachycardia, hypertension, sweating, and hyperthermia.

Those aren’t necessarily dangerous, especially if you’re treated in a medical setting.

Usually these symptoms will begin to arise in a moderate form (in other words non-fatal) when using under 2 milligrams. However, by the time you’re over 1+ mg, there’s a clear chance of severe confusion. That effect itself could be dangerous and can result in self-harm.

#### Severe adverse effects

More severe overdoses, typically arising from over ~2 milligrams, include a combination of: greater hypertension, agitation, thrombosis, greater tachycardia, rhabdomyolysis, seizures, metabolic acidosis, acute kidney injury, and hyperthermia.

Unlike with the average lower-level overdose, these cases require significant medical attention to avoid multi-organ failure, cardiac arrest, and other fatal outcomes.

Most of the overdose effects are largely similar to what can come from other 2C-x and DOx drugs. Although it can be easier to develop severe toxicity with 25I-NBOMe than with 2C class substances.

Fatalities

In order of how frequently they appear, these symptoms show up in severe overdoses and fatalities: seizures, rhabdomyolysis, and possibly thrombosis.

Those provide multiple routes towards organ dysfunction/failure and cardiopulmonary failure.

#### Serotonin syndrome

While some people have described the toxidrome as “serotonin syndrome,” that may often not be the best descriptor.

Some of the key diagnostic criteria for serotonin syndrome are: clonus and/or hyperreflexia with tremor. Those symptoms are sometimes, but not always, present in 25I-NBOMe case reports.

One of the few cases where more classic serotonin syndrome symptoms appeared involved 25I-NBOMe combined with fluoxetine, an SSRI. And there was another similar case involving a combination with sertraline, another SSRI.

Even if we don’t refer to the symptoms as “serotonin syndrome,” a serotonergic mechanism is still underlying many of the negative effects.

#### Problematic mechanisms

Peripheral vasoconstriction could be mediated by vascular 5-HT2A agonism. And significant peripheral vasoconstriction and vasospasm can sometimes result in limb ischemia.

The progression from rhabdomyolysis to metabolic acidosis and renal failure is a major problem in overdoses.

Disintegration of myocytes leads to the release of intracellular contents (CK, myoglobin, potassium). Those enter the plasma and can produce renal failure and cardiac failure.

Rhabdomyolysis can partly come from seizures, which are often present with severe overdoses.

Hyperthermia is believed to be connected to sympathetically mediated cutaneous vasoconstriction, which impairs heat dissipation.

#### Risky combinations (list may not be complete)

Other psychedelics, stimulants, tramadol, and other serotonergic drugs.

(Oosthuizen, 2016) – Providing information during the 2016 TIAFT meeting

- 23-year-old female
- Intranasally used an unknown white powder believed to be “synthetic LSD”
- Toxicology 
- Aortic blood 
- 28 ng/mL of 25I-NBOMe
- 1 ng/mL of 25H-NBOMe
- 0.7 ng/mL of 25C-NBOMe

(Kueppers, 2015) – Australia

- 23-year-old female
- Seen intranasally using an unknown substance believed to by “synthetic LSD” 
- Witnesses said she used a line approximately 10 mm long and 1 mm wide
- Shortly after: 
- Began acting strangely, uttering random words, appearing agitated, and clinging onto her boyfriend’s arm.
- She kept intermittently shouting random words.
- Eventually she started thrashing about aggressively, before apparently seizing and vomiting, following by collapse and death.
- Cardiopulmonary resuscitation attempts were unsuccessful.
- Postmortem exam 
- Confirmed congestion of the lungs and the lungs showed mild pulmonary edema.
- Toxicology 
- Confirmed 25I-NBOMe, 25H-NBOMe, and 25C-NBOMe
- Also confirmed methamphetamine, THC, and a small amount of promethazine.
- No alcohol or other drugs.
- Aortic blood 
- 25I-NBOMe was easily the highest concentration: 28 ug/L
- 25H-NBOMe: 1 ug/L
- 25C-NBOMe: 0.7 ug/L
- The methamphetamine was at 0.39 mg/L, considered to be in the lower range of reported normal “recreational” levels and not likely to be fatal on its own.
- 25I considered the primary cause of death.

(Poklis, 2013)

- 19-year-old male
- He was initially trip-sitting for friends and then ingested blotter paper containing “acid.” 
- First time he had ever used the drug or any psychedelic.
- Whereas the other users didn’t report his effects but had experience.
- Friends noticed his strange and paranoid behavior; agreed it’d be wise to change location and go for a walk.
- His behavior become more bizarre and he abruptly walked away from his friends.
- Friends eventually went to his apartment searching for him; found him prone and unresponsive on the pavement near the apartment complex’s swimming pool. 
- He had either jumped or fallen off his apartment balcony located multiple stories up.
- 911 called; he was pronounced dead at the scene
- Toxicology 
- Peripheral whole blood: 405 pg/mL of 25I-NBOMe which is within the range from other intoxicated patients.
- Aftermath 
- Supplier of the “acid” was arrested after the death.
- He told police 25I-NBOMe was used; had been purchased online in powder form.
- Claimed 1 gram would make 2000 “hits” 
- If that’s the concentration that was employed, that’d yield 500 μg per dose.
- Gastric contents from decedent only showed one piece of white blotter paper, indicating he had taken around 500 μg.

(Shanks, 2015)

- 16-year-old male
- Partying with friends and used a drug on a blotter paper.
- Found unresponsive by friends in the morning.
- EMS called; he was pronounced dead

- Mild cerebral edema
- Toxicology 
- Heart blood: 25I-NBOMe at 19.8 ng/mL
- Urine: Positive for 25I-NBOMe
- No other drugs found in the blood or urine.

(Lowe, 2015) – Combination of 25I-NBOMe with other drugs, though it was likely a primary contributor.

- 15-year-old male
- Went to a party in August 2014 and the DJ was reportedly selling mushrooms and “25I (acid)”
- Decedent seen taking mushrooms and drinking a vial of unknown clear liquid
- Hour later 
- Vomiting and convulsion
- Still coherent enough to say, “This is awesome.”
- Laughing and telling people was fine 
- But then he continued to have more convulsions until he lost consciousness.
- Transported to fire station; failed resuscitation efforts.
- Transferred to local hospital 
- Intubated
- Acute renal failure with serum creatine of 4 mg/dL
- Liver failure with AST and ALT levels in the 10,000s
- Coagulopathic w/ disseminated intravascular coagulation-like presentation.
- Died from multi-system organ failure following cardiopulmonary arrest 3 days post-administration.
- Toxicology 
- Blood 
- Positive for 25I-NBOMe at 0.76 ng/mL
- Urine 
- Positive for 25I-NBOMe, 25C-NBOMe, and 25H-NBOMe.
- Also positive for psilocin.

(2014)

- 17-year-old female 
- She was on lithium (potentially serotonin syndrome contributor) and topiramate for mood disorders
- Ingested an unknown substance on blotter paper.
- Presented 
- Status epilepticus, hyperthermia, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, elevated transaminases, acute kidney injury, metabolic acidosis, and rhabdomyolysis.
- Subsequently developed cerebral edema and was then declared brain dead on Day 7 in the hospital.
- Toxicology 
- Antemortem 
- Whole blood: 25I-NBOMe at more than 0.25 ng/mL
- Lithium at 0.34 mmol/L (lower than the therapeutic range)
- Interpretation 
- Even though the lithium was at a low concentration, this case was considered to be a death from serotonin syndrome resulting from 25I-NBOMe and lithum.

  "tripsit-wiki": `# NBOMes

*Source: https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/NBOMes*

These chemicals have nearly no history of human use prior to 2010 when they first became available online, and very little is known about this group of compounds. They should only be used with extreme caution. It's strongly recommended to not take more than 1500 µg of any substance of the NBOMe family, as there have been multiple deaths from people taking just 2-3 blotters.

## Dosage

Effects have been reported to vary wildly between people (example: person A gets a 4-hour body high with barely any visual aspects, while person B gets a >12 hour DOB-like trip with an intense visual aspect). Drugs affect all users differently, but this unusually wide range of reported effects is down, in part, to users being unable to accurately distinguish between members of the NBOMe series, and misrepresentation of doses - a single tab regularly yields between 500ug and 2000ug of the substance.

NBOMes were initially thought to be orally inactive, meaning they wouldn't work if swallowed. However, this is not the case for all NBOMes per se; certain NBOMe salts do have an observed oral bioavailability, with little known about the oral bioavailability of NBOMes in their freebase form. Therefore, when a substance might be an NBOMe, discard the blotter entirely rather than swallowing it, if you do not wish to risk being under the influence of an NBOMe. Oral administration is relatively uncommon and thus undocumented, presumably as a result of the existing confusion about the oral bioavailability of NBOMes. Sublingual administration is the most common, but buccal administration is recommended if you wish to avoid the generally bitter taste of NBOMes.

The doses of NBOMes remain a controversial subject, as deaths have been reported at doses that were previously assumed acceptable. Please use caution, and in any case, **do not exceed 1500µg**!

## Harm Reduction

NBOMes are considered less safe than many psychedelics due their heavy physical effects on the body, and as recreational dosages tend to overlap with what have been fatal dosages. Even so, many reports of death by an NBOMe chemical involve mislabeling of the drug, sometimes by the distributor (example: someone insufflates 20mg of 25I-NBOMe because he/she thought it was 2C-I). Mislabeling or misweighing can easily lead to extrememely dangerous, sometimes lethal, situations. Administration of an NBOMe in its powder form (either insufflated or otherwise) is strongly discouraged, as the potency is far greater than the accuracy of most scales.

Furthermore, due to the physical strain the drug causes one should not use it if there are any pre-existing heart conditions.

See [Psychedelic Harm Reduction](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/Psychedelics#Harm_Reduction) for general information.

25I-NBOMe, also known as 2C-I-NBOMe, Cimbi-5, and shortened to "25I", is a psychedelic drug of the phenethylamine, 2C, and NBOMe (25-NB) families. Since 2010, it has circulated in the recreational drug scene, often misrepresented as LSD. It is the most well-known member of the 25-NB family and the earliest member to be encountered as a novel recreational drug.
The carbon-11 labelled version of 25I-NBOMe, [11C]Cimbi-5, was synthesized and validated as a radiotracer for positron emission tomography (PET) in Copenhagen. Being the first 5-HT2A receptor full agonist PET radioligand, [11C]CIMBI-5 shows promise as a more functional marker of these receptors, particularly in their high affinity states.
Street and media nicknames for this drug include "N-Bomb", "Solaris", "Smiles", and "Wizard", although the drug is frequently fraudulently sold as LSD.
Due to its physical effects and risk of overdose, there have been multiple deaths attributed to the drug. Its long-term toxicity is unknown due to lack of existing research.
25I-NBOMe was first described in 2000. It was first encountered as a novel recreational drug in 2010, and by 2012, NBOMes like 25I-NBOMe had surpassed other major psychedelics like LSD and psilocybin-containing mushrooms in popularity, at least for a time. 25I-NBOMe became a controlled substance in the United States in 2013.

## Use

### Recreational

Although 25I-NBOMe was first described by 2000, it did not emerge as a common recreational drug until 2010, when it was first sold by vendors specializing in the supply of designer drugs. In a slang context, the name of the compound is often shortened to "25I" or is simply called "N-Bomb". According to a 2014 survey, 25I-NBOMe was the most frequently used of the NBOMe series. By 2013, case reports of 25I-NBOMe intoxication, with and without analytic confirmation of the drug in the body, were becoming increasingly common in the medical literature.
25I-NBOMe is widely rumored to be orally inactive; however, apparent overdoses have occurred via oral administration. Common routes of administration include sublingual, buccal, and intranasal. For sublingual and buccal administration, 25I-NBOMe is often applied to sheets of blotter paper of which small portions (tabs) are held in the mouth to allow absorption through the oral mucosa. There are reports of intravenous injection of 25I-NBOMe solution and smoking the drug in powdered form.
Due to its potency and much lower cost than so-called classical or traditional psychedelics, 25I-NBOMe blotters are frequently misrepresented as, or mistaken for LSD blotters. Even small quantities of 25I-NBOMe can produce a large number of blotters. Vendors would import 25I-NBOMe in bulk (e.g., 1 kg containers) and resell individual doses for a considerable profit.

### Dosing

25I-NBOMe is potent, being active in sub-milligram doses. A common dose of the hydrochloride salt is 600–1,200 μg. The UK Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs states that a common dose is between 50 and 100 μg, although other sources indicate that these figures are incorrect; Erowid tentatively suggests that the threshold dose for humans is 50–250 μg, with a light dose between 200–600 μg, a common dose at 500–800 μg, and a strong dose at 700–1500 μg.
At this level of potency, it is not possible to accurately measure a single dose of 25I-NBOMe powder without an analytical balance, and attempting to do so may put the user at significant risk of overdose. There is a high risk of overdose due to the small margin between a high-dose and an over-dose, which is not a risk with the similar drug LSD. One study has shown that 25I-NBOMe blotters have 'hotspots' of the drug and the dose is not evenly applied over the surface of the paper, which could lead to overdose.

## Effects

25I-NBOMe effects usually last 6–10 hours if taken sublingually, or buccally (between gum and cheek). When it is insufflated (snorted), effects usually last 4–6 hours.
25I-NBOMe has similar effects to LSD, though users report more negative effects while under the influence and more risk of harm following use as compared to the classical psychedelics.
Case reports of seven British males who presented to an emergency room following analytically confirmed 25I-NBOMe intoxication suggest the following potential adverse effects: "tachycardia (n = 7), hypertension (4), agitation (6), aggression, visual and auditory hallucinations (6), seizures (3), hyperpyrexia (3), clonus (2), elevated white blood cell count (2), elevated creatine kinase (7), metabolic acidosis (3), and acute kidney injury (1)."
25I-NBOMe can be consumed in liquid, powder or paper form and can be snorted, injected, mixed with food, or smoked, but sublingual administration is most common.

## Toxicity and harm potential

### Neurotoxic and cardiotoxic actions

### Emergency treatment

### Attributed deaths

Reports of deaths and significant injuries have been attributed to the use of 25I-NBOMe, prompting some governments to control its possession, production, and sale. The website Erowid states that 25I-NBOMe is extremely potent and should not be snorted, and that the drug "appears to have led to several deaths in the past year." Several non-fatal overdoses requiring prolonged hospitalization have also been reported.
As of August 2015, 25I-NBOMe has reportedly led to at least 19 overdose deaths in the United States. In June 2012, two teens in Grand Forks, North Dakota and East Grand Forks, Minnesota fatally overdosed on a substance that was allegedly 25I-NBOMe, resulting in lengthy sentences for two of the parties involved and a Federal indictment against the Texas-based online vendor. A 21-year-old man from Little Rock, Arkansas died in October 2012 after taking a liquid drop of the drug nasally at a music festival. He was reported to have consumed caffeinated alcoholic beverages for "several hours" beforehand. It is unclear what other drugs he may have consumed, as autopsies generally do not test for the presence of research chemicals. In January 2013, an 18-year-old in Scottsdale, Arizona, died after consuming 25I-NBOMe sold as LSD; a toxicology screening found no other drugs in the person's system. The drug is the suspected cause of death in another Scottsdale, Arizona, incident in April 2013. It is also cited in the death of a 21-year-old woman in August 2013 and the death of a 17-year-old in Minnesota in January 2014, as well as the death of a 15-year old in Washington in September 2014. In October 2015, a 20-year-old UCSB student from Isla Vista, California died of "acute hallucinogenic polysubstance intoxication" with an additional significant cause of death being "sharp force trauma of the upper extremity", according to a statement from Santa Barbara County Sheriff's office; the autopsy determined Sanchez was under the influence of two hallucinogenic drugs at the time of his death: ketamine and 25I-NBOMe. The noted sharp force trauma refers to a deep cut on Sanchez's right forearm, which was caused when he punched and broke a large residential window while suffering hallucinations.
25I-NBOMe has been implicated in multiple deaths in Australia. In March 2012, a man in Australia died from injuries sustained by running into trees and power poles while intoxicated by 25I-NBOMe. A Sydney teenager jumped off a balcony to his death on June 5, 2013, while on 25I-NBOMe.
In July 2015, 25I-NBOMe was involved in the death of 18-year-old Liam Miller in York, England. Miller was stabbed 32 times by his close friend, Samuel Donley, during a psychotic episode after both had ingested the drug. Donley also attacked a passer-by and inflicted self-injuries before being detained. He pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility and was sentenced to six years and eight months in prison. The court described the incident as a "drug-crazed frenzy" and highlighted the extreme psychological effects associated with 25I-NBOMe.
25I-NBOMe has been linked to a major case on January 20, 2016, in Cork, Ireland, which left six teenagers hospitalized, one of whom later died. At least one of the teenagers suffered a cardiac arrest, according to reports, along with extreme internal bleeding.
At least one suicide, and two attempted suicides leading to hospitalisation, have occurred while under the effects of 25I-NBOMe.

## Interactions

2C drugs like 2C-I are metabolized by the monoamine oxidase (MAO) enzymes, including both MAO-A and MAO-B. As a result, 2C drugs may be potentiated by monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), such as phenelzine, tranylcypromine, moclobemide, and selegiline. This has the potential to lead to overdose and serious toxicity. In contrast to 2C drugs, 25I-NBOMe has been found not to be metabolized by MAO-A or MAO-B and instead only by cytochrome P450 enzymes. Other 25-NB drugs besides 25I-NBOMe were not assessed.

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

25I-NBOMe acts as a highly potent full agonist for the human 5-HT2A receptor, with a affinity (Ki) of 0.044 nM, making it some 16-fold higher affinity than 2C-I at this receptor. 25I-NBOMe induces a head-twitch response in mice which is blocked completely by a selective 5-HT2A antagonist, suggesting its psychedelic effects are mediated by 5-HT2A. This study suggested that 25I-NBOMe is approximately 14-fold more potent than 2C-I in-vivo. While in-vitro studies showed that N-benzyl derivatives of 2C-I were significantly increased in potency compared to 2C-I, the N-benzyl derivatives of the related compound DOI were inactive. 25B-NBOMe is a low-potency weak partial agonist of the rat and mouse trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1) but is inactive at the human TAAR1.
The affinities and potencies of 25I-NBOMe at the serotonin 5-HT2 receptors have varied in different studies. Its affinities (Ki) have ranged from 0.044 to 0.6 nM for the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor, 1.91 to 130 nM for the serotonin 5-HT2B receptor, and 1.03 to 4.6 nM for the serotonin 5-HT2C receptor. Conversely, its potencies (EC50Tooltip half-maximal effective concentration) have ranged from 0.76 to 240 nM at the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor, 111 to 130 nM at the serotonin 5-HT2B receptor, and 2.38 to 88.9 nM at the serotonin 5-HT2C receptor. The drug shows biased agonism at the serotonin 5-HT2C receptor.
25I-NBOMe also has weaker interactions with multiple other receptors. Kd values for interaction with the following targets were greater than 500 nM: 5-HT1A, D3, H2, 5-HT1D, α1A adrenergic, δ opioid, serotonin uptake transporter, 5-HT5A, 5-HT1B, D2, 5-HT7, D1, 5-HT3, 5-HT1E, D5, muscarinic M1-M5, H3, and the dopamine uptake transporter. 25I-NBOMe is inactive as a monoamine reuptake inhibitor and releasing agent. However, 25I-NBOMe has been found to increase dopamine release from mouse striatal synaptosomes similarly to methamphetamine in vitro. Likewise, 25I-NBOMe has been found to increase dopamine levels in the nucleus accumbens in rodents in vivo.
A radiolabelled form of 25I-NBOMe can be used for mapping the distribution of 5-HT2A receptors in the brain.

### Pharmacokinetics

25I-NBOMe is metabolized by the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. It does not appear to be metabolized by the monoamine oxidase (MAO) enzymes MAO-A or MAO-B.

## Chemistry

Like other 2C-X-NBOMe molecules, 25I-NBOMe is a derivative of the 2C family of phenethylamines described by chemist Alexander Shulgin in his book PiHKAL. Specifically, 25I-NBOMe is an N-benzyl derivative of the phenethylamine molecule 2C-I, formed by adding a 2-methoxybenzyl (BnOMe) onto the nitrogen (N) of the phenethylamine backbone. This substitution significantly increases the potency of the molecule.

### Synthesis

25I-NBOMe is usually synthesised from 2C-I and 2-methoxybenzaldehyde, via reductive alkylation. It can be done stepwise by first making the imine and then reducing the formed imine with sodium borohydride, or by direct reaction with sodium triacetoxyborohydride.

### Analogues

Analogues of 25I-NBOMe include 2C-I, DOI, 25B-NBOMe, 25C-NBOMe, 25I-NBOH, 25I-NB3OMe, 25I-NBMD, 25I-NB4OMe, 25I-NB34MD, 25I-NBF, and DOI-NBOMe, among others.

## History

25I-NBOMe was first described in the scientific literature, in the form of conference abstracts, by Ralf Heim and colleagues at the Free University of Berlin by 2000. Then, in 2003, Heim described 25I-NBOMe in his dissertation. 25I-NBOMe was further investigated by a team at Purdue University led by David Nichols in 2006 through 2008. 25I-NBOMe was encountered as a novel recreational drug by 2010, and by 2012, NBOMe drugs like 25I-NBOMe had eclipsed other psychedelics like LSD and psilocybin-containing mushrooms in popularity, at least for a time. 25I-NBOMe became a Schedule I controlled substance in the United States in 2013.
