## Subjective Experience

Whilst chaliponga is generally used as an ingredient of ayahuasca, I have occasionally
encountered reports which claimed a degree of success via the route of quidding.

Whilst this sounded unlikely, I decided to experiment regardless, and procured the
requisite material from an online vendor.

I placed the leaves into my cheeks, and held them there whilst they dampened. I held
them and held them, for what seemed to be an eternity. I found it to be extremely
difficult to forget that this stuff was there.

I got little. Perhaps a minor change in headspace materialised but perhaps not.
However, as the leaves are supposed to be fresh, and mine were quite old, the chance
of significant success was always going to be minimal.

This one was filed in the basket: try again if you ever obtain fresh leaves.

## Summary
Diplopterys cabrerana is a shrub native to the Amazon Basin, spanning the countries of Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru. In the Quechua languages it is called chaliponga or chagropanga; in parts of Ecuador it is known as chacruna—a name otherwise reserved for Psychotria viridis.
D. cabrerana and P. viridis are both common admixtures for ayahuasca. Both species are rich sources of  DMT, a tryptamine thought to be endogenous in humans and many other species. D. cabrerana additionally  produces 5-MeO-DMT.
The plant stores the alkaloids N,N-DMT, 5-MeO-N,N-DMT, and N-methyltetrahydro-beta-carboline in its leaves and stems. Leaf samples were found to be 0.17-1.75% N,N-DMT, but only trace amounts of N-methyltetrahydro-beta-carboline occur in the leaves. The leaves also store methyltryptamine and trace amounts of bufotenin.
Cuttings of D. cabrerana are transplantable. The cuttings are either planted in soil directly, or rooted first in water.
