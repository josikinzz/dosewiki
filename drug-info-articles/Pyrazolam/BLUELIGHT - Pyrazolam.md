Anyone know anything of this? A Google search showed up absolutely nothing for me. It's it coming into stock on Monday and I asked my vendor and all he seemed to know was that is was a benzo.... The formula kind of gave that away though.

I'd hazard a guess that you aren't going to find any knowledge whatsoever about that chemical, let alone anyone who's tried it, without inside info. I'd suggest being extremely careful, also you might want to ask in ADD about the safety of that compound - I'm not an expert but as far as I'm aware, a pyridinyl sidechain on a benzo is unheard of and could potentially cause some very unexpected effects. Same to a lesser extent with the bromine - although brominated benzodiazepines do exist I've never heard of it being subsituted in that position before.

Doesn't bromazepam have a pyridinyl group?

unless i'm spelling stuff awfully  - which is very common


Bromazepam is : 9-bromo-6-**pyridin-2-yl**- 2,5-diazabicyclo [5.4.0]undeca- 5,8,10,12-tetraen- 3-one


But this one would also be a triazolo family a la xanax and triazolam

Correct, but that pyridinyl group is part of the benzodiazepine skeleton, as opposed to in this poster's case where it's in a side chain. Note the name given above ends with "-benzodiazepine"; this type of naming procedure is basically shorthand for "a benzodiazepine with the aforementioned sidechains", whereas the IUPAC name you've given for bromazepam (which is totally correct) doesn't use the "-benzodiazepine" shorthand. Hope that makes sense, I'm kinda benzed.

From what I read about this benzo in German drug forum is that it comes in 0.5 and 1 mg strengths. 1 mg is equivalent to 0.5 alprazolam and it is a short-acting benzo, just like all other triazolos.


Another coming out is flubromazepam and Demoxepam.

I havent tried the compound, but should be receiving some relatively soon.


Would hazard a guess at it being more anxiolytic than hypnotic... but who knows, nobody I'm in contact with has tried it yet.

If the doses are as low as 0.5 mg, wouldn't it be strange the first vendor I found selling it. Selling a powder form relatively cheap, over pellets? I mean profit wise it would make little sense...

its possible your vendor knows jack shit about what he's selling concerning proper dosage and could care less as long as he continues to sell product

but I do see your point


I'd wait these ones out and wait for other sources of info to surface concerning dosage and effects - no use in just blacking out because you took too much of an unknown benzo and possibly end up in a situation you don't want  to be in (driving your car whilst blacked out ... etc)

And for the same reason I'd avoid alcohol like the plague before I was familiar messing with any of these new benzos.

Well naturally, I'd purchase some as soon as possible. I always do with new compounds, especially when the price seems to be something that will fly up at the same rate as the knowledge of the substance. I will just hold off trying it until more it known. 


I can't seem to find an exact match to this RC in any journals on the Internet though. There are close compounds, but not this exact one. Does that strike anyone else as odd too, them going for a totally new chemical over one of the hundreds that are established yet still legal?

It appears the fact that doses are 0.5 mg is correct. The original vendor that 'was' advertising it as being released over the coming days at half grams and grams has changed it to 0.5 mg pellets, slightly more expensive than Etizolam. 

From what I have gathered from various vendors, it is 'hard hitting' with 9 - 12 hours half life. So slightly better than Etizolam perhaps... Or just vendor hype!

I doubt it's anything like triazolam, but maybe more similar to estazolam or alprazolam. Many benzos are "hard-hitting" - especially the hypnotics.


Remimazolam is a benzo I want to try.

Im wary of any RC benzodiazapene after some of the horror stories Ive heard about phenazepam. Im definitely interested though. Adrandell, you should write a trip report after you try it ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png). Just be careful lol

I have little experience with benzo's (Valium and Etizolam) and only use them to sleep if I'm having trouble, so a trip report wouldn't be much fun. (took at midnight, slept for X amount of hours... Haha ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

as far as I can see there is only one UK vendor selling this rc. This is the same vendor that sold rti-31 which was a total waste . They basically spent money trying to synthesize rti-31 and couldn't do it but still sold it to their customers to get their money back so before u buy be careful as the vendor cud be doin the same with this rc. It seems strange that there is only one vendor selling this rc.

It is definitely more similar to the triazolo benzos (alprazolam, triazolam, estazolam, etc) than it is to bromazepam, but because it does have similarities to bromazepam I think that it would be more anxiolytic, but with decent sedative-hypnotic effects. So maybe it is more similar to alprazolam but with slightly more sedative properties (but falls short of triazolam's sedative-hypnotic properties). I think it is likely more recreational than alprazolam as alprazolam is really not that recreational, despite what many like to think. Xanax is really just a superb anxiolytic, but has very poor muscle relaxant and anticonvulsant properties. It has moderate sedative and amnesiac properties and that's all that alprazolam is.

They made the grave error of selling Phenazepam in powder form and not pellets though, so there was many mistakes made with dosing. So I can see peoples irritation at the release of a sub-mg benzo. But with this (and Etizolam), they have gone for pellets being the main form, so as to avoid errors occurring and informing people of proper dose size at the same time. Even if it is more expensive, it should see less mistakes being made (making it safer) and hopefully prolong its legal status too...

The main vendor selling this gives the following binding data:


α1 3.84±0.25


α2 1.31±0.19


α3 1.48±0.21


α5 3.72±0.32


As far as I know, this has never been synthed before, never mind tested *in vivo* or *in vitro*, so I'm guessing that this is pretty useless?

What is the concern about over safety if ppl know its active at 0.5mg? What I mean is, are people worried that the drug may be toxic?  That the drug maybe active at the microgram level? That a vendor will masteknly put 5mg per pellet instead of 0.5mg? Or just that people might be reckless and stupid with the stuff?


If one were to take 0.25mg or less as a test dose, wait at least 12 hours before redosing, work up in 0.25mg incriments to hit their individual sweet spots, use aa scale if in powder form and don't mix with anything, then is there something to be worried about other than the vendor itself supplying the wrong chem/dose?

Some people have a thing for benzos. When I was using Etizolam I would dose 2mg and always end up dosing again, to the point where I would end up going through 80mg in 2-3 days, and not remember what the fuck happened until my friends gave me a report on my stupidity. The problem with Etizolam is that it's active metabolite has a longer half life than the drug itself. It build up in the system and will fuck some people over.


The majority of people here aren't going to wait 12 hours to redose. They will wait a bit, but they will redose and it will build up in their system until they either go to sleep for a bit or black out, finish gobbling down what stash they have left, and wondering where the days went.

^ while this never happened to me with etizolam, it definitely did with phenazepam.

in regard to benzo RC's, i checked a few vendors and found that pyrazolam sounds definitely interesting,but  because it is mainly sold as 'pellets' it has the same problem that etizolam has - that is a lot more expensive on a dose to cash ratio. even though i find etizolam vastly preferable to phenazepam, i've just ordered three grams of the latter, mainly because i only have a certain amount of money every month to spend on drugs, and while eyeballing doses of any pure benzo powder *will* end in disaster - i made the mistake of assuming that because of my experience with benzodiazepines this didn't apply to me - if a proper solution is manufactured using a weighted and verified amount of powder the problem with dosing becomes non-existant.

Its not that simple which is why its a bit dangerous. I could care less as anyone with any intellect knows that potent chems equal dollar signs and people will do whatever it takes to get those dollars so why not let them release them as long as they aren't outright harmful(who knows in the cases of ones like these where no human trials have been undergone, while I am excited to take a new triazolo(?) benzo come about I am also not excited to possibly be prey to weird side effects that can happen with anything, though I wouldn't have to worry to much as I doubt I would dose it much but...still!). Benzos especially certain ones have a bad tendency of causing accumulation of certain metabolites which can cause them to increase largely not only when redosing but it will then once again increase the amount of time total to clear all of it from your system. Plus phenaz's real problem IMO was its half life, it is never much shorter than a couple of days for anyone and benzos already have the whole causing retrograde amensia combined with the blacked out redosing people do(you may think this isn't you but its literally everyone, just think if you could amplify ethanol's loss of inhibitions and multiply it ten fold and you've reached benzos....if you play with benzos you'll eventually find yourself waking up with little recollection of what happened and ten pills less than you were supposed to eat). People also don't relieve how truly subtle some benzos effects are/can be, the ones that are mainly anixolytic with little muscle relaxation can be fairly hard to notice especially at lower doses if your not anxious when you ingest them which leads to redosing. Another thing to note is that phenaz had a somewhat lengthy come up from what I remember so many people would stupidly redose a few hours in thinking they weren't getting anything when really things just hadn't kicked fully into gear yet.

I get what u mean with the longer lasting metabolite, so is it that this new chem also has an active metabolite, or  that nobody knows whether or not it does?


B/c I've gone too far and woken up days later with no cash, phone and an empty bag of pills too often to count, so I don't think the problem is even limited to RC benzos, it can happen with well known and relatively short acting benzos too if u just take things too far

I have been told the same by 3 vendors now. Short come-up, hard hitting and 9 - 12 hour half life. I have not taken Xanax, so I have no idea if it is similar to how that sounds.


I'm surprised no one has bought this and left more information yet? :/

Not by much more than Etizolam still is if bought in small amount though... So with 1.5 - 2 times the half life, it works out better value in a way!

The only two vendors that are shipping pyrazolam are NOT shipping to Canada, USA or Australia. Anyone else claiming to carry pyrazolam is a fake! 


lastest, where are you from? If you are from the US, Canada or Australia then you are NOT going to get any shipment. 


BEWARE ALL NORTH AMERICANS. THE ONLY LEGIT 2 VENDOR WITH PYRAZOLAM ARE NOT SHIPPING TO THE U.S. OR CANADA!

Yeah I'm prescribed the 0.25mg triazolam. It's very important to write down or somehow record this: Time, Drug, Dose.


I use my phone for this, as a poly drug user it's important to know what you've taken over the day.

I have some in my possession now. They look like Etilaams, but white.

Been an hour and a half since I ingested 0.5...they taste like shit and I'm not getting anything yet to speak of...just nailed another whole one.nothing to write home about yet I'm afraid. Ignore hard hitting comments in my opinion. My benzo tolerance is currently fairly low as well. Will let you all know.


I wouldn't say they look like etilaams but more like white versions of the chalky,chunky blue all the way through RC vendor etizolam. I'm sure that's what you meant latest, etilaams are very thin by comparison.


FYI I tried holding under my tongue but couldn't take it...I'm known to crunch pills in my mouth but not these! So I'm still holding out hope...

I've only ever had the branded, blister-packed etilaams so I wasn't comparing vendor-made etizolam. But on on closer inspection I see you're right - they are quite a bit thicker than etilaams. I only sneaked a look earlier because I'm at work - I picked them up from the post office on the way in. I'm so damn bored I'm tempted to drop one right now.


They sound pretty disappointing - my benzo tolerance is fairly high due to using more etizolam than I should, so I'm likely to get even less from them than you.

I might be wrong but with etizolam being a thiendiazapiene these white tabs claim to be a straight benzo so you should be ok...take one mate, I have now had two, half a bottle of wine and a k cider...still waiting for that special something...I might be under playing my tolerance but right now I'm happy I only got 10...


Lastest get hold of an RC vendor proper chunky etizolam blue or red pellet. Proper good consistent product that in my opinion. Tolerance doesn't grow as much as with pasaden etc


The 2mg reds well had the potential to ruin my life!

So you're saying the vendor etizolam is better than etilaam and other branded stuff? Interesting.


I was wondering about the thieno / benzo thing actually - I was under the impression that etizolam was legal because it wasn't actually a benzo, but if pyrazolam is legal too then I guess I was wrong.

Zopiclone is a thien and illegal...they fucked around with something to make the structure of etizolam outside the law. And yes vendor etizolam is far better IMO however some cheeky fuckers have popped all the etilaam out of the packs and are selling them as etizolam pellets...non branded RC lab pellets are very chunky, blue all the way through and utterly tasteless at 1mg. The 2mg red ones are an exceptional product!

Actually, yeah, last time I bought etizolam it was loose tablets in a baggie but they were definitely etilaam. I wondered why they bothered to take them out of the original packaging.


Pity about the Pyra - I'll let you know how I get on with mine on Monday. Also, I'll be giving some to a friend who has no tolerance, so it'll interesting to see what they do for him.

That sounds like a brand naming for some vendor to up the price of an already widely available chemical or mix of chemicals. Email whoever is selling it and ask what the active ingredients are and let us know!

I had 1mg (two .5mg pills) last night and I didn't really notice any subjective effect from it. I do think they helped with sleep though - these days I don't sleep well at all without either etizolam or dph (I'm trying to rely on the latter more than the former for obvious reasons) but I slept fine last night so I reckon the Pyrazolam was doing the job that my normal hypnotics would usually do. 


None of the muscle-relaxant or amnesiac effects that I used to get on etizlolam were present, but cross toleration with etizolam might well be to blame for that. The only way to know for sure is to take larger doses but I don't want to do that - in fact as of today I've decided to quit all GABA related stuff for the foreseeable. Not sure if I can pull it off but I feel I should try at least.


EDIT: I should add that I took 3-MeO-PCP a couple of hours after the Pyra, so it wasn't at all a well conducted experiment! Having said that, it does make it all the more likely that the Pyra helped me sleep as 3-MeO is quite stimulating.

Because, benzo's, expect for flunitrazepam and temazepam in some states, are schedule IV substances. The analog amendment shit only applies to Schedule I and II substances. Same for the UK where benzo's are Class C, and Analogue laws apply to Class A&B.

Okay well my no benzos or alcohol rule lasted all of 48 hours and tonight I decided to have a couple of beers and give the pyra other try. Considering 1mg gave me no noticeable effect I knocked back four pills equalling 2mg. That fucking worked and no mistake - my muscles are mush and I was banging into the walls as I made my way upstairs. No particular euphoria but I definitely feel benzo'd up - I doubt I'll be able stay awake for more than about half an hour.


So the stuff works for sure, but unless your tolerance is zero you might well need more than 1mg to really feel it. Do start off low though if you're new to this stuff.


Jesus, well like I said the stuff works no question. I have a serious blackout regarding what happened between my last post and waking up this morning, but a count of my remaining pills shows I ate another two (1mg). So that's 3mg in total and this morning I feel pretty out of it. So be careful with this benzo, it's definitely effective - just because you don't feel much from up to 1mg doesn't mean you won't black out at 2mg.

looks like it could be another case of wildly random doses in each 'pellet'.

I remember several freebie benzo fury pellets that were like that, and even different sizes. apparently it was a pressure problem with the machine. some of them were knockout others not very effective (the tablets).

^ Maybe - the pellets don't seem well made at all - they start disintegrating as soon as you put them on your tongue. On the other hand if .5mg pyra equals 1mg etiz then I'm not surprised that 1mg of pyra didn't do much - I take 2mg of etiz very regularly and don't feel much from that any more. I suspect that if I took 6mg of etiz last night instead of 3mg of pyra then it would have turned out much the same.

Hmm, you would think they could think of a more apt brand name for 5MEO-DALT really. It has no effects that would 'blast' you anywhere. It's rather mild!


I think I may give this Pyrazolam a miss for the time being, maybe it will improve in a few batches though. So I'll give it a few months before trying them out!

Lol read this while about to bite one in half. Maybe this chemical takes a while to reach peak blood concentrations? Something to be careful considering there is not a lot of information out there.


Im currently on 2 Pyrazolam 0.5mg tablets. Both taken within the last hour. I have a heavy history of etizolam abuse so tolerance may be high.


Will report back.

feels like 0.25 etizolam but again I have a heavy tolerance up to 15-20mg in a day been clean for 2 months. I have had a lot of artificial cannabinoids almost 500mg of am-2201 think its shit batch tho off a reputable supplier as well (tut,tut).


pyrazolam seems pretty bullshit and not value for money 3 hours in on 1mg though I have a heavy history of benzos

Pyrazolam does not seem to be very euphoric, the come-up is pretty drawn out. 


Having 3mg of them made me pretty intoxicated but if you have a tolerance 


they dont offer good value.


Good for ending Ethylphenidate cravings though, etizolam can be dangerous and addictive.

Perhaps for killing a cluck, but it won't get you high. Especially if you get withdrawals, I imagine you would have a much greater tolerance than me.

i really enjoy etizolam and weed but it can be tooo sedating, i think these might be better cos it will just be the anti-anxiety part which i like the most, as i sometimes get weed anxiety, its nice to have a care free stoning from time to time ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I've tried 1mg while on an oral dose of am-2201, then a few smokes of ur-144. It was nice. I'd say the euphoria is equivalent to etizolam. I also didn't feel as groggy the next day as etizolam sometimes does. (Even though it's only very mild grogginess.)

Can anyone compare this an actual benzodiazepine, rather than Etizolam which is a thienodiazepine? I assume it is going to bare more resemblance to a drug of the same class rather than one of a similar, structurally close class...

Benzodiazepine and thienodiazepine are just categorizations.  In terms of effects, etizolam is much more similar to classic benzodiazepines than olanzapine, which is a thienodiazepine antipsychotic.

Thienodiazepines are analogues of Benzodiazepines, granted they are categorisations of GABA agonists. But they are still a different class of drug, albeit only slightly. (They are as similar as a cathinone is to an amphetamine). 


I'd also say it is best to compare a compound, to a compound with a long standing history and of the exact same classification. Rather than a relatively new RC or foreign medicine, that is an structurally similar and only analogue of the comparison...

After trying Pyrazolam, I would say it is a lot less euphoric than etizolam and diazepam although it shares the amnesia/blackout/clumsy traits and length of diazepam.

Could Pyrazolam be an effective hypnotic after a night on stims? I hate not being able to sleep when I want to. Etizolam didn't really do that for me, just made me feel like a wet towel. Also felt really slow the day after due to (I think) etizolam's incredibly long half-time.

Pyrazolopyrimidine class of drug most likely. One of the newer anxiolytic chemicals I'd guess but who knows? Trademarked names like Camphetamine for fuck sake? It's all a bit smoke and mirrors with RC's these days.

1. Demoxepam isnt very new and its basically nordiazepam (i have a post about this if you want to find out more).


What worries me is that unlike etizolam or phenazepam this benzo is not used in any country! Also there isnt even a wikkipedia article on it. There is no place to see the pharmacology or at least half life and such.


**Is this a purely RC benzo? (as in not used in medicine?)**

Etizolam is about the shortest acting benzo ive ever had and ive had most of them. I dont know where you are getting your information but it's wrong.

^ All benzos are structurally similar to each other. Just because pyrazolam has a chemical structure similar to triazolam it doesn't mean that it will be like triazolam or that it will be as short acting as triazolam. Alprazolam and triazolam are very close structurally, but effect wise they are like day and night. The tiniest change in a molecule can produce great differences between drugs.

According to the interweb, demoxepam is the active metabolite of chlordiazepoxide therefore would be 'norchlordiazepoxide'? No?  Stand to be corrected - those GCSE grade B's don't equal a PHD, granted.  Would be very interested in this if it eventually came to market, Librium has been a good friend to me in the past

yeah, chlordiazepoxide is a fairly mild benzo, and to the best of my knowledge not more or less toxic that any other of the classic benzos.

Yes. Your right I was thinking lithium not Librium. 


Lithium is very toxic and has caused severe permanent  damage to patients. 


Librium for anxiety fairly safe. 


Lithium for bipolar very toxic. 


Haha. On my drug book it has a warning for look a like sound alike warning. 


It looks like lithium is is only in generic and is advised to be give in a medical facility that can check levels often. 


My apologies for my error.

Oh yeah it could go that way with me too but I REFUSE TO ABUSE ANYMORE. Strict medicinal purposes with these. 0.5 mg works as an active dose easily. Strict situational use defo on the cards, not an everyday thing IMO.

Etizolam was a thienodiazepine while pyrazolam is a benzodiazepine derivative - so to answer your question yes, it is an outright benzodiazepine.


It is one of the triazolo benzo's similar to bromazepam, triazolam and alprazolam in structure and, presumably, abuse potential.

So as etizolam is one of the theino benzo's - would you call that an outright benzo too?

No, it is a benzodiazepine analogue. It falls in the same class as brotizolam.

Well I just ordered 15 of the 2mg Etizolam pellets, and they are rock solid with a really good press, expensive. But I have taken like 5 or 6 of them, yes (12mg of Etizolam) to be correct. And I barely feel any effects, and it has been over an hour and a half. I have a benzo tolerance, but it should be much lower since I am on a Diazepam taper down to 15-20mg/day. So you think I should be able to feel the Etizolam? 

Especially if I have anxiety.. I mean, whats up with these pellets? I have had better effects when I was on a much higher dose of Opiates and the 0.5mg Etizolam Mcleouds Pharma blistered from India were stronger than these.  These pellets that are made in the UK are not up to par with the etilaam or any blistered Etizolam for that matter IMO.

This compound is a benzodiazepine, not a thienodiazepine, and is a very close structural analogue of alprazolam. Pharmacology isn't my strong suit but I'd be surprised if it wasn't also a pretty close functional analogue.

About when benzos are more sedative vs. exerting more anxiolitic properties: (from wiki, yes) *Different benzodiazepines have different affinities for GABAA receptors made up of different collection of subunits, and this means that their pharmacological profile varies with subtype selectivity. For instance, benzodiazepine receptor ligands with high activity at the α1 and/or α5 tend to be more associated with sedation, ataxia and amnesia, whereas those with higher activity at GABAA receptors containing α2 and/or α3 subunits generally have greater anxiolytic activity.[10] Anticonvulsant effects can be produced by agonists acting at any of the GABAA subtypes, but current research in this area is focused mainly on producing α2-selective agonists as anticonvulsants which lack the side effects of older drugs such as sedation and amnesia*

How do you know what you got was pyrazolam? 

How does anyone know what they've been getting is not etizolam, or phenazepam, or a mix, or even strait alprazolam powder (pressed into "pellets" in this case), etc?

If you read what i'd said I was discussing the differences between the two, saying etizolam is a thieno, and pyrazolam is a benzo. It's a triazolo benzo like alprazolam and triazolam.


EDIT: That wasn't meant to sound condescending. Sorry i'm in a bad mood.

And I barely feel any effects, and it has been over an hour and a half. I have a benzo tolerance, but it should be much lower since I am on a Diazepam taper down to 15-20mg/day. So you think I should be able to feel the Etizolam?

I have had better effects when I was on a much higher dose of Opiates and the 0.5mg Etizolam Mcleouds Pharma blistered from India were stronger than these.

Are you talking about the pink ones or another version I haven't tried? I swear by the pink ones mate. If you pay around a pound for one of these it is excellent value for money. I think your benzo tolerance may have something to do with you not experiencing much! Plus, less is more with etizolam.

im certainly interested in this one. is it possible to purchase it in blister packs by a pharmaceutical company like intas, or does pyrazolam only come in pellet form?? the more i hear on these, the more interested i become.i find etizolam to be weak, but the buzz is perfect. i just expensive for me to enjoy them. id also like to try some phenzepam. im a (fairly) responsible benzo user. i could handle having powder but would much prefer a legit tablet like the intas etilaam. i dont buy pellets. i think i got scammed by an rc vendor ordering 10 pellets for 1 euro a pop. and after 4 years benzo free, i needed 3 to feel anxiety free, and interested in little things.

ALSO. 

As it's duration of action is 6 hours - does that mean you'll still feel the effects until 6 hours later ? Because with etizolam i find i don't feel any effects w/e from it a max 2 hours later.  How long is Etiz's duration of action

Sorry that my reply comes 5 months after your post. I've only just taken it in, and it made me wonder if anyone has had tests done on these ? Does anyone know for sure it is a brand new chemical, and not just some chemist who thought "we'll chuck in a bit of this, a bit of that, and tons of this and mix it all together." And hope someone wants to buy it.


I've just tried a couple of these for the first time today. It's very noticeable that they hit different parts of the brain to what etizolam does. Pyraz seems to turn me into a selfish shit who doesn't care; whilst on etiz I feel as if i am focusing on and considering others more. In effect i become a nicer person on it. It lowers the unhelpful parts of my disposition; anxiety, excessive inhibition, also minimizes anxiety whilst smoking noids.


Pyra doesn't do all of this for me. YMMV ?? i Don't really like they way it makes me feel so far, but further experiments will follow.


Anyone felt anything similar, or is it just me ?

IIRC etizolam has some kind of effect on serotonin levels. Maybe that has anything to do with the euphoria and social behaviour changes that many people mention.


But even if that isn't the case, i made the same experiences with other benzos before. For example: Benzos like Alprazolam and Triazolam make me selfish, i don't care about anything and i lose interest in almost everything. On the other side, benzos like Bromazepam make me warm, interested in other people and raise my mood. It doesn't even feel to me like these substances are related.

^interesting theory and id have to agree. xanax makes me feel the same way. its like the "crack" of benzos. i like etizolam ALOT tho. it does make you feel really good and open and it doesnt have that crash, that xanax often has.


^and yes the intas brand 1mg blister packs are the way to go. aside from knowing a reliable source for etizolam powder.

You mean the pyraz and the etiz both had the same 'sherbert dip, vitamin c' type taste ?

Much less sedating, more clear headed. Not much euphoria but very good for day time anxiety.

interesting, yea, alot of benzos seem to specialize in sedating. thankfully benzos dont make me tired. i can stay up all night on klonopin putting puzzles together. sounds like a cleaner, less messy benzo than xanax. would be cool if it had less amnesiac properties as well. i want to check this one out, i just ordered phenazepam this week. just waiting on it to become more available and consistent, for lack of a better word. would love to see these in blister packs or on my vendor i trust with powders.good looking out guys! keep us posted! -aphex

The description lynx gives above is spot on.


I just received a free sample. 5 lovely yellow tablets. They are the same shape as the last ones but the press seems more professional. The taste is not that horrible same one as the those last white ones (and the bright blue etiz) so I was able to hold it under my tongue for at least ten mins.


They seem to have an added euphoric quality as well, nothing mind blowing but these are defo better than the last ones.


Do people really find xanax not messy? It can knock my socks off! And as an ex smack head that's a real bonus!


For me Pyrazolam will always be just an anti-anxiety tool, and not much more. However, these new ones do seem to have something else about them, or maybe i've just been blagged by the colour!

Yeah, I slammed 1mg. I haven't injected any other benzos so I really can't compare, but there was a definite rush - not one of euphoria, but of a massive strength of confidence, reassurance and anxiety release. Kind of like that feeling when thatt whole 2mg Xanax bar hits you, except it's instant.


The weakest IV effect I've had - not surprising since the others are cocaine, oxycodone, morphine, heroin - so not necessarily worth it, but otherwise I find pyrazolam overwhelmingly weakk. Like alprazolam without any of the other intrinsic effects , and in terms of anxiolytic effect I'd rate it around oxazepam.

I took 1.5mg two hours ago. The first time I've tried it. Nothing. No euphoria, minimal (if any) anxiety reduction. They may be bunk but they are as described above and I got them from a reputable vendor. Or rather, one that I've never had any problems with at all in the past. I think I may be genetically predisposed to not feel any of the recreational effects that many report with benzos as I've never had any from etizolam either (though they are great as an anxiolytic). Just not for me, I guess.

I have 3mg of this left. I took about 5mg of etizolam across the space of this morning - last one about 8 hours.

I'm off out tonight and didn't want to waste anymore etiz so thought I might just do the full 3mg of pyraz and see if I get any reaction from it (mainly for anxiety), given how I got nothing yesterday on 1.5mg I'm guessing not much. Are there any particular risks with mixing this and etiz, given how long ago i took the etiz?

^^ I didn't bother in the end, but I did do 2mg of pyraz and 2mg of etiz this morning and didn't feel anything other than what I would from 2mg etiz on its own, which isn't much tbh (I have developed a tolerance with etiz, that's for sure - even though I space out when I take it several days, weeks and one time two months inbetween taking any - my problem is that when I do take them I binge across the day (3mg to start in the morning, then 2mg again a few hours later and maybe 2 or 3mg later that night).

I've decided to give up on pyraz though - as I say, it's probably just not for me as others are clearly getting a lot from them. Oh well... ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)

Yeah, I think it's more a panic thing with me - if I have something I'm really anxious about like an interview or something, I'll take 3mg when I get up before eating anything, then a couple of hours later just as I'm leaving I'll take another 2mg sublingually and then take another 2 or 3mg chopped up in a wrap to take about half hour before I get there. And then later in that night if I'm going out I'll take about 2-4mg depending on how I'm feeling. When I first started taking etiz (and phenibut) much smaller amounts would knock me out (I could barely hold me head up), now at worst I just feel a little tired later in the evening, so tolerance is definitely there but that's to be expected.

Anyway, maybe all that has screwed my chances of getting anything from pyrazolam, so for now I'll just stick to etiz.

Everyone else's mileage may vary obviously, and seems to judging by reports upthread...

^that actually does sound like alot. i go through 5-10 on an average benzo day. usually stop at 5. i like to take 2.5 in the AM and 2.5 around noon when they wear off. you would benefit from a longer lasting benzo, like klonopin or phenazepam (careful) if you cant get a script. valium works good too and lasts very long. if i do 15 mg valium in the AM i am fine with taking like 2-3mg etizolam to finish out the night. i have like 2 or 3 days a week i do this. i try to keep it from being a problem, but it already kind of was before it started, if ya know what i mean. i have a weak pre disposition to benzos. but opiates are way more anxyiolitc and enjoyable for me. plus they relax my muscles and i have alot of tense muscle issues. i try to alternate between opiates and benzos, very slippery slope. but who cares.

Hi


Pyraz seems all to be in 0.5mg pellets but peps need a minimum 2-3mg for a littler effect. Seems weak. Should have made 1mg pellets atleast.

Well anyways, i have 10 pellets for free on the way from a newer batch, lets see if its the same or the first one i got differed any?

Had been eating alot of xanax latly, might have been therefore..but will feast from xanax (already tappering) and do those other pellets in 1-2 maby 3 different dosage (depends) and give a complete report for you guys who need more info ( i know benzo´s since am 13years old) anyways i have been looking for the POWDER but it is nowhere, i think this is safe enough to sell in atleast small amount of powder (10-20mg small small baggies) or pellets with higher mg but can cut in 4 (like rivotril or some other benzodiazepines from africa/asia, or the faustan diazepam brand from italy(?)


If i need 5 to feel like a real tab of benz. Than i see no reason to play with rc´s like these if your not in a country where it is impossible to find or harsh penalties.

Not only since its never the real thing but you also pay 3x-5x the price of equal benz..............

As for me if there was powder would buy for a year or 2years to have it but then not a dollar per mg or more like the pellets cost me here.


Anyone know a site or a thread with pyraz "experience reports" then please pm, been awile since i was in here (been living in asia and forgot my password until now)

Now back in this best forum. Hi all old school frieands :D


Btw, Those of you who have had pure powder and triead it, what do you think about the pyraz 0.5mg pellets going round in UK right now? 

Do they contain 0.5mg ? Are they even? Like all 0.5mg not 1 is 1.2mg and another one has 0.2mg in it ? 


Merry x-mas and a happy new year 2 all bluelighters ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Having read that this is water soluble... exactly how soluble is it? If I just dropped a pill In a glass of water and waited 24h would't it be dissolved (other than the binders I guess)? An no, I'm not planing on injecting it or putting it in somebody else's drink (or anything else immoral and or dangerous). Just curious is all.

I'm not sure about that, but by grinding it up into a small amount of water, I was able to get it to dissolve... At least judging by the effects of injecting it, I felt definite benzo effects.

Thanks mate. Other than grinding it, did you do anything sopecial (heating the water or something)?

Also do you thing it be stable in vodka instead of ordinary water (worried of growing some moulds or something)?

I tried a few of these yesterday. The feeling is quite nice (a little better than etizolam as far as I'm concerned). But I agree on what other's have said - they are a bit expensive and weak, would probably be better if they either came in 1-2mg or were a bit cheaper. The duration could be a bit longer to.


Haven't tried dissolving them in water, but they melt in your mouth really quickly.

Ive been eating since thursday, so far so good. 

Ate 3 today after work, beginning to get calm :-D

There is also flubromazepam. It's still harder than etiz/pyr to find and there aren't many reports out so far. But according to the few I've read it's supposed to be quite nice.

Maybe we'll now more in a few months when reports start coming out in larger amounts.


However so far etiz is the rc benzo to go to - cheap, effective, easy to find and strong enough.

I hesistantly add that Phenezepam is also relatively easily available. Tons of safre handling research is essential before diving in.

Oh yes, totally forgot about that one. But like you said if  you're not going to be extremely cautious with it just leave it alone (just read the horror stories about it, net is full of them). If you really want to try it, don't forget some peg and dose really low.

Phenazepam pellets were at one point available and in circulation, and it is my experience with these that left such a good impression of the drug on me - it is in my top half of benzodiazepines I've tried.

Really? Shame I missed them, only ever saw the powder. Which wasn't that bad except for being really hard to dose. Pellets would have solved a lot of phenazepams problems (aka shitheads who thing you can eyeball a substance active in the mg range).


Anyway regarding pyrazolam, my final opinion is that it's not a bad benzo but just has a shitty price/effect relationship compared to etizolam. Especially for people with some tolerance. Would be a nice experiment to have some one who never tried benzos before eat a pellet or two and describe it's effects.

Hey bluelight people. Hope everyone's ok, staying safe etc. 


I've had a glance through this thread and felt the info to be a bit patchy. Apologies in advance if I missed something - that would be bloody typical of me. Just give me a verbal boot in the arse if so.


Basically, I've got 20 pyrazolam pellets coming and this will be my first experience with them. They're just for recreational use - instead of alcohol. I quite liked etizolam after stims but found then too sedating for recreational use on their own. 


I'm mainly keen to get ideas about safe dosing. any other tips or suggestions also appreciated. 


If anyone has a moment to share their wisdom, I'll be eternally thankful. Well, at least as long as I live anyway. Can't promise gratitude after that cos, let's face it, who knows?  ![:-)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Oh yeah, also, I'm assuming that as it's a Benzo, it's naturally going to be addictive. Is that right?

Yes, it's addictive like all other benzos. Can't tell you exactly how addictive compared to the others.


Regarding safe dosing... well most people agree that it's quite weak, especially if you got the 0.5 mg pellets, so unless you mix it with other cns depressants (like alcohol), it should be quite safe, with the worst thing that could happen probably being the classic 'ate a whole a bunch of benzos, did stupid shit, don't remember any of it'.

Hi again


Sorry, I thought I had replied already but my post must have failed or something. Thanks for the info. I've now given it a couple of goes. Once, for safety, at 1mg in the evening. The second time was 2.5 mg on the subsequent evening. 


Certainly the second time, the mood lift was detectable, albeit mild. The wierdest thing though was that it made me feel compelled to go to bed. Hold on, hold on, I know that doesn't sound wierd - so I should explain: I don't mean it made me feel tired. It made me actually start thinking: "what I would love to do is go to bed and watch a film or something." I repeat - NO tiredness. 


So I do this. I go up, get comfy, put on the film, feeling perfectly awake and cheerful whilst doing all this. Then I start watching and that's it, I'm gone. 


I didn't get 2 minutes into the film!! But at no point did I feel tired or start nodding. 


That's the first bit. 


The second bit was the dreams. I have NEVER, bar none, had such insane, intense, disturbing and humorous dreams. This I was not expecting. I woke up in the early hours, and felt like going back to sleep - but the rest of the night was filled with so many mental dreams that the quality of sleep was poor. Nothing like the all-night stint you get from many other benzos and sleepers. 


It might have been different if I hadn't been woken up in the early hours. Noise outside did it. I will try it again when I know there won't be any disturbances. I am guessing that I will sleep through, then come through the REM sleep with mental dreams, but wake up feeling more refreshed. 


Based on that, I would say don't use these in the evening if there might be disturbances in the night. 


Anyway, we'll see what happens next time. 


Thanks for the reply Catman.

They are 0,5mg. 


Ive eaten totally about 150 of them over a month period. 

I stopped cold turkey and got no bad effects. 


I like pyrazolam becouse it removes my anxiaty and dosent get so drowsy or high /stoned. 

Perfect in my daily Job.

Not seeking to be argumentative; but did u see what happened when the uk etiz vendors started getting greedy/scared of customs. They boshed thousands up thousands of inferior cheapo chalkk tabs in their bathtubs or sheds, and the pills were estimated by userd to contain btween 0 and 5 mg each (for a supposed 1 mg pill). 


The only way id touch phenaz in pill form would be if you could satidsfy yourself 100 % they were legit.


Its nice in PG anyway, a few ml of that and the couch and remote is your oyster. Maybe the big pharmas were worried about lawsuits considring how potent it is. So far its the only thingh that i can feel off 1mg. 8- 16 mg + you wont wake up until  abt 10.30 pm the next day first time you dose that high. Threres no need though really. is there its just playing silly beggars as my grandad used to say. Like who can drink 20 pints (of beer - not phenaz) in 2 hrs and all that shite. I mean  so what, give yourself a fuckin  medal.

No offence taken, you make a good point. I've heard various stories that confirm what your saying about etizolam. Lucky my vendor remains legit and I've never had any complaints regarding the dosing of his pellets (scorred blue on the outside, white on the inside, I think they are just repackaged pharmaceutical ones). I'd say more but with the whole no vendor talk thing, I think that this is enough.


Won't comment much about phenaz pellets, since I've never actually seen one. I do agree however if they were improperly dosed it be almost as bad as powder.

Right I have said it before and I will say it again, this is not a recreational drug! Do not buy if looking for monging out.

I highly doubt that it would be worth it. Phenazepam itself only has two states Part 1. Threshold effects typical of benzodiazipines but which you won't *feel* in any recreational way, Part 2. blackout.


That's just my opinion, but hanging on for it pre-dosed out for a panic attack might be worth it, but as a recreational drug, no.

it will be nice with a few joints if you tend to  get anxious/paranoid on weed alone. will give you more of a relaxing  mentally high, no mind  racing thoughts and introspection

i'd don't know about combining it with a few joints (not a fan of weed), but it is a nice benzo for anxiety that doesn't cause much sedation, the main problem is that if you have any tolerance at all you'll need a more than one of the 0,5mg pellets for a noticeable effect

i was talking about pyrazolam by the way. i'll test some in a few days and do a thorough report. i took some etizolam the other day so i'm trying to remain as benzo naive as possible for the new experience. i think i am naturally anxious so i should experience something from 0.5mg. we will see!

Hey.  I have been taking etizolam for around 10 months now, and don't even have a high tolerance with them (3mg a day max).  The entire time I've been taking them I've never had to up my dosage.  However, the withdrawal symptoms I get when I go a while without taking are horrible. (No sleep, no energy, twitching, lots of dry retching, constant anxiety etc), but because of the mental dependance and really short half life they are basically impossible to taper off.


My supplier just got pyrozolam in and I was just wondering would it be a good idea to switch to these given the lower dosage and seemingly almost double half life, thus making it a lot easier to taper off altogether eventually.  Anyone able to confirm if .5mg of these actually does last up to about 6 hours?  Or if they have the similar relaxing, anxiolytic feel?

Switching to a benzo with longer half life and strong anxiolytic properties for a taper is sound thinking, but why on earth would you hop from a little known rc to a completely unknown one to get it done? You probablydon't want to hear this or you wouldn't have asked this particular question, but explaining your predicament to a physician who can prescribe a proper and reasonably safe replacement, suggest a taper regime and monitor your progress would be the right thing to do. Ceasing benzos isn't to be taken lighty, hardest form of habit to break imo, I wouldn't fuck around going about it DIY style.

Demoxepam isn't anything special, on one hand it's okay and on the other hand there are worst benzos. 


There's a thread on it started by 'reflekt' and you should find it if you use bluelight's search engine however from what I remeber in that discussion is that it breaks down into nordiazepam (which in turn metabolizes further to oxazepam and temazepam). BTW b/c it metabolizes partly to temazepam doesn't mean it gives the same effects, it has its own effects (better than phenazepam but not as good as etizolam or diazepam). 


In other words demoxepam should be treated as nordiazepam. In my experience it kicks in within 1hr and there are some anxiolytic effects however they might last 3-4hrs while the lingering after effects last another 24hrs or so, doesn't linger as much as phenazepam but you will feel it the next day (more so than diazepam or clonazepam).  


p.s. Should be worth noting I've never had Librium so I dont have the best refference since it's the principal metabolite in Librium....like Soma v.s. Miltown (meprobamate) or codeine v.s. morphine, there is definatley a difference in pro drugs and their mother drug. Hope this helps and I too am waiting on more reports regarding pyrazolam.

I've been trying out .5 mg tablet's lately and I can't say much about them. I use etizolam semi-frequently, more so recently than in the past; but I never use more than 1 mg a day so I don't expect my tolerance is too horrible since I still feel desired effects from etizolam (easy sleep, relaxation). The most I can say about pyrazolam is that it really does seem to ease anxiety. I feel quite fearless on pyrazolam, and I'm a little bit more daring than usual - which can be a good and bad thing. One experience I found I was very sedated; more so in fact than on etizolam. For the other occasions, however, I've noticed no sedation. 


Interesting anxiolytic, probably better for people looking for help with anxiety/drug tapering.

I ordered 10. I found I needed 4-5 swallowed for much of an effect '(Xanax-lite'). But I noted the 'water-soluble' bit on the website & crushed/snorted 2.... wallop. It was like 15-20 seconds.


Can some chemist explain this. I know heroin acts in seconds and morphine takes minutes, is there a reason for this?


Sorry - new-bug, just wanting to understand.


Thanx.

it's funny really, since both clorazepate and chlordiazepoxide are metabolised to desmethyldiazepam, but they are markedly different in their effect. while clorazepate is quite pleasant if subtle, chlordiazepoxide is just... shit. it's a centimeter above tetrazepam in the useless department. also i have never heard of desmethyldiazepam being metabolised into temazepam, do you have a source on this

Come on guys, give some proper feedback.


I've taken 2mg of this today, in combo with 3mg of etizolam (the etizolam was dosed about 4 hours in between) and 1mg of Pyrazolam two hours ago and snorted 1mg just now, as far as I can tell it has killed my anxiety but other then that I don't feel much goodfeel so to speak, that shit really clogged up my nostril tough. But I am very anxiety plagued so we'll see. I'll get back to you in an hour or so when the effects should have kicked in properly. Maybe I'm just totally ignorant of benzo effect or benzo like effects, but not much of anything really.

Okey, here is some feedback, this is not something you get particularly high on, you don´t feel much drugged up but it makes uncomfortable situations very durable! I took two 0.5mg pellets when I woke this morning as I have severe anxiety related to any social situation, and particularly school. Today I´ve been able to sit down with my teacher for two hours as she has taught me "newnorwegian", witch I struggle with horribly, and I´m still sitting at school alone doing schoolwork, something pretty much once in a life time for me. It doesn´t give me particular pleasure but it def makes social situations lots more enjoyable without making you feeling fucked up. It keeps your personality quite intact I must admit.


But in my honest opinion I don´t find this a valid treatment or substitute for it. The pellets are quite expensive for the amount of bang you get for your buck, etizolam is way more "powerful" by it´s dose, two etizolam = four pyrazolam in terms of anxiolytic effects, ofcourse in a different manner, Pyrazolam is way more effective in regular work/school/productivity then Etizolam but it´s just not cost effective, rather get regular Xanax from your doctor for free.


And I don´t know dosage of regular use of Xanax for GAD but it sais on this website I found it´s 0.25-0.5mg, as a starter dose, three times a day. That would be equivalent to quite a lot of money per day, probably the same as a nicotine habit. Atleast where I live.

i've lost the hypnotic effects of etizolam. 

regardless in the mix of anti-histamines and alcohol

but the pop three to knock me out has been long gone.

i still get muscle relaxation and general ease after stim use


in terms of "recreational" 8) benzo use, etizolam is far more prevelant imo for abuse versus pyrazolam


edit: i always take at least 1mg pyra

Hm...I must be unusual in my reaction to pyrazolam then. It should be noted that I am already on a prescription GABAergic, chlormethiazole, but every time I've used pyrazolam, its had a kick like a pissed off mule. Which is odd for a benzo, I seem to be quite difficult to sedate with most of them.


I've no acquired benzo tolerance, but familar with a fair few, its certainly amongst the stronger ones I have tried, although I can't compare with any of the other triazolo-substituted benzos.  alprazolam and triazolam both are blacklisted from NHS prescription in the UK according to my psych med prescriber's handbook (no, I'm not a medical professional, it just makes for a useful reference at times)


Nasty tendency to cause blackouts though, I've had 250 pill buys dissappear before, and woken up several days to a bit short of a week later thinking 'what the fuck just happened' ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)

awesome benzo, .5 is enough for me to eliminte nxiety for a while. Very little recreational value but that's exactly what i like about it. I need a benzo that can calms me down without too much sedation. I can also use it as a sleep aid if i take 1mg. I like it more than etiz, also lasts a bit more for me

Took two 0.5mg pyrazolam pills and I find it brilliant for day time anxiety. I then decided to take one more 0.5mg just before I headed out and it made me feel slightly too slow to function properly, it was too calming and I think I was speaking quite slow. 1mg is probably the best dose.

Dam, gotta be careful aye. When I abused Etiozlam I had total memory loss and drug induced sociopathic tendencies. Not as bad as Valium, but I was taking over 10 for a few days. Though I do have a bad reaction to some downers. Thanks for the tip mate, I'll be extra cautious now ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I would like to hear your experiences from using this drug, I have also a couple of questions  :


Is it safe and harmless to use Pyrazolam ? What are the dangers from using this drugs ?


How would you compare the effects of Pyrazolam with effects of Xanax or clonazepam, oxazepame ?


What are the pros/cons of this drug ?


Have you experienced any tolerance issues and withdrawal symptoms ?


If anyone has any experiences with Etizolam, How would you compare these two drugs (Etizolam vs Pyrazolam ) ?


Thank you in advance !

After obtaining around 30 pharmaceutical grade Etizolam (Sedakopan tablets), 50 generic EU professionally pressed Etizolam tabs, and 50 pharmaceutical grade Pyrazolam tabs, SWIM's had many experiences with them and there are very comparable differences btwn each other and rx benzos. Years ago, SWIM was a serious Alprazolam addict and in those years he was prescribed large doses of many additional benzos, mainly Lorazepam, Clonazepam, Oxazepam,  Diazepam, and his least favorite 'Mother's Little Helper' or Chlordiazepoxide and even Phenobarbital for when he was trying to kick Xanax). 

   So the prescription benzos I would most liken Etizolam to would definitely be a cross between Ativan and Klonopin with a slightly shorter duration. For the first hour Etiz can give a very calm stimulating effect, but the sedation always sets in after a while. SWIM's first time trying Etizolam was with a bunch of insufflated Ethylphenidate. He had a black out after half a g of Ethyl and 4 or 5 1mg Etiz. then came to the next day feeling miserable with only 11 of 20 Etiz. left. But a week later SWIM tried the Etiz. by itself and found it rather euphoric for a benzo-type drug. The trick is to slowly titrate your dose and do it .5mg or 1mg at a time. When using in responsible moderation Etizolam is a very fun RC. According to wikipedia, Etiz. actually becomes more active the longer you take it*, but realize using Etizolam every day for a few weeks can & will result in severe addiction.

   Pyrazolam is nothing like Etizolam, nor is it really like any prescription benzo SWIM's encountered in the days when h had 4 to 5 doctors writing monthly scripts for various benzos and formulations of amphetamine. Like many people say, Pyrazolam's main effect is definitely anxiolysis. Even at 1/2 a mg it releaves moderate anxiety and a great deal of stress. A 1 mg dose of Pyrazolam reminds me of a 3 gram dose of Phenibut. With 2 to 4 mg doses one becomes very care free and SWIM found it easy to start blabbering on and on about bullshit. There isn't really euphoria involved beyond a minor extent. This would make a magnificent medical benzo to replace Xanax. There's almost no sedation at 1 or 2 mg and it is very effective at cutting anxiety. Also, after taking too much Ethylphenidate 1 mg of Pyrazolam effectively slowed the heart rate and made SWIM comfortable again without cutting the stimulant buzz. Although Pyrazolam lacks the hypnotic, amnesic (which I hate), muscle relaxant and strong sedative properties it would be ideal for anxiety at work or when one needs a buzz without getting drowzy. Hope I could help...

Ive had major anxiety lately, receiving a 3 grand bill (payable next week btw) victims of crime, bad day today.


Took like 3mg etizolam, 1mg or was it 1.5mg pyrazolam, and 300mcg catapres (clonidine) as I was also on md pee vee and had to go for a big walk to go get my methadone.... didnt need heart to explode on the walk upihll.


Having a high benzo tolerance and being on stims, 2-3 hrs since last pv dose, I wanted to nodd off! I still am... (its just been 3-4 hr) so yeah, I feel great. I need to try and lower my tolerance. I did take some phenibut last night (forgot how much i capped up, i think maybe 250-300mg?) no noticeable effects from that, except I slept (but I was exhausted)


I am already over my anxiety attack/suicide/lets drink my cyanide water mix now.. though amazing, Life saving though addictive I do not have daily thoughts like this, maybe twice a week i get BAD compared to just.... anxiety I spiral out of control, anger hatred and self harm entails usually.. Etiz and Pyrazolam work well, I only have about 30mg of etiz left and 45 or so .5 pyrazolam, (and other traditionals, 4mg alpraz, 10 or so 2mg loraz) but I try and stay off the loraze especially with its long-er half life. I think this pyrazolam stuff is really the go for my non-general anxiety but panic attacks..and anxiety brought on by triggers, I am able to sense my mood and can medicate accordingly.


**NSFW**: 


I do have etaqualone to try out (carefully) when I am unaffected by anything else, and  will try  and get my benzo tolerance LOW too but it's hard being me right now...Really really hard.Like, almost to the point where I amthinking about my 6th attempt at taking my own life, except instead of downers, with 3 grams of potassium cyanide. So this stuff is a lifesaver.I went to my doctor again (he has given me valium and xanax in the past in LESS stressfull circumstances, but only like..... 7mg in a month, ONCE, and 50x 5mg valium, ONCE, and 15x .5mg xanax ONCE. when I had a benzo tolerance at around half of where I am now (4mg xanax to fix anxiety).


The fact this stuff is not metabolize into any known chemicals, it is water soluable if  you need to IV yourself or IM shot for QUICK relief (i cant wait for the powder, I stupidly made my etizolam 1mg/ml or so, perhaps 1.5) and i cant inject straight PG, needs to be diluted to 30%! That's a huge needle if I ever needed a panic attack fix. Because when I lose it i normally end up breaking something and or someone, or myself. Although I am trying to not take benzos because i only need them every so often, which is how it should be. The reason i'm on methadone is because I was abusing opiates for their anxiety relief, not the high so much..


Love this stuff, but yeah I take 5-HTP, multivit's, L-Dopa (awesome), and phenibut (MAYBE, i have some... I hear its like benzos on w/d though, i dont need further tolerance.... research to do there!) and vitamin D every day... Anti depressants make me suicidal and i'm sick of not doing it properly, and sick of even trying it. I need to get treatment for my mental issues but all i do is get laughed at because I am honest about my self medication and drug use. But I have been diagnosed by  multiple doctors and forensic psychs with BPD, BiPolar mixed traits, and ADHD in jail, with stratterra given but no continuation because GP laughs at me and no psych to contact -- I forgot the jail psychs name ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png) ) 


5mg dex is perfect for me, or 1-2mg xanax, or possibly 0.5-1mg fof this stuff when i have trouble/anxiety./suicidal thoughts/anger rage/ whatever. But I am drug tested and with my mental health being self treated I could end up in jail just for trying to not follow a bad path for the 6th time.  (I' might make a thread in the other forum detailing my crisis and situation instead of being so vauge here). Life saving medication right now. The Health system in South Australia is FUCKED for mental health patients, especially those who self medicate and dont just slash wrists to kill themselves but eat 100's of Alpha blockers, antihistamines and 3-4grams of seroquel.... not a cry for help any more, this coming appointment on the 3rd of august with my methadone doctor who i just fond out is a psychiatrist and addiction specialist also.... he may be helpful to me, I love htis doctor anyway... doesnt treat you like a cunt scumbag junkie fuck when he knows you're there to turn your life around.


**Fuck, yes I am on** stimulants, **sorry for the post. Ill hide my life story/suicide/thankgodforthismedication rant in NSFW tags above**

^No offense but I think doing stims, especially MDPV is very contraproductive in your situation. And if you want to lower your tolerance, quitting any stims would definitely decrease the need for downers.


On Topic: Compared to Etizolam I found Pyrazolam to be pretty lame and non-recreational at doses from 0,5-1,5mg but it is very functional.

More so than Lorazepam in my opinion. I haven't tried Alprazolam so I can not compare the two.

If someone seeks an Anti-anxiety Benzo with little to no sedating effects, this one fits.

A bit weaker and less recreational than Xanax, never tried the others.

It's mostly just anxiolytic so if other benzos make you tired this one maybe wont.

Cons not recreational, a bit weak (especially if you have some benzo tolerance).

No, but I never took enough for a long enough period of time.

Etizolam is both anxiolytic and hypnotic, a little stronger, much more recreational and is better value for money.

There are also some anecdotal reports that it has a milder withdrawal, but then there are also reports of people having quite bad withdrawals, so it's not something I would count on.

Oh, no doubt. No offense taken.


There are reasons I do these things that go beyond a simple "i'm addicted" because I'm not.. It's more "I had 50 bucks in bitcoin left and thought i would get rid of it"


But there is other reasons like being tied to the house by my leg, so boredom results in stimulant use. (and lots of time on facebook, drinking lots of coke, eating junk food) but I am very very careful about my use of benzos, only using them when absolutely needed (like yesterday's major depression/sucidal ideation and subsequent binge on everythign I have except alprazolam,lorazepam,MBZP and Etaqualone.) Had like 12 drugs in my system. Stupid. 


Stimulants or not. Benzos always save my mood from spiralling out of control into suicidal (or violent of intervened with) behaviour and thoughts. I have had 5 different psychs tell me things from BPD, ADHD, Extra Chromazone ?, Bipolar, Temporal lobe epilepsy. No further help though.


I prefer Xanax, but this is more attainable since my doctor just laughed at me when I asked for help for my anxiety. But thanks for the 5 repeat levitra 20mg x8 script. :/ its lovely breaking girls when they dont expect it.

Anyway ^ that,i is off topic.


Pyrazolam I find better than etizolam, because I dont need to get high I just need to function. It's like when you've been taking xanax, dosed up to 2mg maybe 2 or 3 times a day for panic attacks or whatever you have.... you will not feel the sedation and the CNS deprssion is minimal, but the anxiety relief is the same.


Same as me on methadone (80mg pd), does not even get me a touch high, i cannot feel it "kick in" but give me 2-3 days and i can sure feel without it. I do not want to be this way on benzos.

When on the brink of a nervous breakdown at work I took a single .5 mg pellet sublingually and wow! It saved me. I felt great for the last 3 hours of my shift then felt calm and peaceful for the next 8 or 9 hours. At 1.5-2 mg + it can be quite recreational. If taken with a small amound of etizolam this adds a really smooth euphoria to the pyrazolam.

Yep, I like pyrazolam. Clean and functional. 


It's a handy thing to have in the benzo toolbox for times when you simply need anxiety relief without feeling and looking fucked up. 


Good stuff.

Guys.


From what little info I've gathered, all benzos can cause blepharospasms, but Etizolam has a significantly higher chance to cause that side-effect, and for that reason I avoided it, despite the higher recreational value that others have reported. What about Pyrazolam? I know it's a bit early, it being an RC and all, but anectodal experiences should suffice for the community for now.

Heyo! Thought I'd share som of my Pyrazolam experiences. Bought 10 of the yellow ones to try them out. I have no benso-tolerance but have eaten ALOT of alprazolam, diazepam and clonazepam(and the usual sleepers, zolpidem, zopiklon and nitrazepam). 1 0.5mg tablett is very noticable against anxiety and general angst. For sleeping 1mg should be enough for most people who just want to calm themselves down a bit but 2-3mg might be needed for thoose who really needs a sledge-hammer to fall asleep.


Just got a 100pack to try them out some more. One thing I noticed is you get alot more sluggish after using them as a sleeping-aid compared to nitrazepam. Anyone know why the after-effects are lingering so long?

I brought some; found the effects very sluggish. They seem to make time fly past, so quite hypnotic. I took the tablets orally, and the effects kicked in after a mere 15 minutes. I slept very deeply on them, and felt groggy the next day. Overall I found pyrazolam very sedating, I have to add though that  I'm not experienced with bentos.


I personally didn't enjoy the effects; I would only use them to ease comedowns, possibly as a sleep aid. It's interesting to note how cheap these things are compared to etizolam.

So has anyone came to a conclusion if these things are the Alprazolam Analog they are being made out to be ??


Edit: What I meant by that is it anything like Alprazolam at all ??? The chemical structure looks nice, but so did Diclazepam and that was a failure :-s

Just posting to say I think it's amazing how differently people are responding to pyrazolam. I mean, it's a given that everyone will respond to substances in different ways, but I don't think I've seen such a wide variety of reactions listed as with this one. 


Personally, having been on and off benzos for years now, and having experienced a few different types (alprazolam, diazepam, etizolam, temazepam, clonazepam, phenzepam), I was amazed when I tried pyrazolam, because I find it to be the single most "mono" action benzo out there. I mean, I find it quite effective at killing anxiety (from which I unfortunately suffer and am scripted valium), but it doesn't seem to me to have any other effect whatsoever. 


If I take a higher than normal dose of etizolam or alprazolam, my motor coordination is noticeably impaired, and this is twice as true for clonazepam. A high dose of diazepam or temazepam will space me out and make me drowsy. 


But with pyraz, a high dose has no effect other than removing anxiety. I'd rate it as the single most functional benzo I've ever tried for therapeutic use.

pyras is so strange i can take as many as i want and have no anxiety and no slugglish or tiredness/drowsiness. i take em out while i do my excising and everything.


pyras are just pure anti anxiety, theres no euphoria or drowsiness or much muscle relaxation, not very recreational on there own.


ive took  pyras for days on end in silly doses with no rebound anxiety or withdrawl

It took it 4 days in a row, and experienced  reduced sleep quality for a night, but was fine. (4 days is my max) In comparison when I have a drink, I feel anxious and jittery for around 48 hours. How many pyraz have you taken max in a day btw?

Tried a couple the other day. Good for sleep, and might help those who are a bit on the nervous or jittery side....or suffer from gad. Otherwise, bit f a waste.

In my opinion, it's hard to answer this because of the subjectivity of people's experience, but as I said a couple of posts up I have found pyraz to be extremely useful for managing my anxiety without experiencing any of the "side-effects" (which are often the desired effects for people who are using them recreationally) such as drowsiness or impaired motor coordination. 


I really like Diclazepam, and as I am scripted Diazepam for my anxiety I find it similar but - as some people have said before - more like a cross between etizolam and diazepam. So if I take a double dose of diclaz, or a quad dose of diaz, I feel noticeably slower in my reaction times and have short term memory issues. 


I can take quite a few pyraz without noticing anything other than a reduction of anxiety.

Yeah, its useful for anxiety if you need a functional anti anxiety pill without feeling stoned. I've taken it tonight, and I'm feeling a more typical response (the first time I felt sedated). I feel incredibly calm right now and I'm coasting, but I'm also alert and clear-headed. That could be a good or bad thing, it depends what ur looking for in a benzo. I do enjoy these however.

^ I think it's a great thing. 


I have to do a lot of driving, and I worry about taking more than my proper (ie. scripted 10mg of diaz per day, which is nowhere near enough for my tolerance) amount and getting behind the wheel. 


I never drive if I feel that my reaction time has really slowed down, but on occasions I have choice (I live in an area where the last bus is 9:30pm, and my girlfriend sometimes finishes work well after that time, thus can't get home unless I pick her up). So taking pyraz is a good short-term solution, because it does not affect my coordination. My girl has commented on this (my driving) so I know it's not just my imagination...

Iive still to get some but if it's the case that it's pure 100% anti anxiety with no recreational effects or potential for addiction then it sorta sounds like something doctors could hand out with no worries, defoes gna get these.

You've hit the nail on the head; they just make you really calm, no sedation. They can be much cheaper than other RC benzo's as well. Imo they have far lower abuse potential than other benzo's; I can take them or leave them.

Quite a cute little pill to swallow. Curled up on the sofa watching tv with my wife, I found myself cracking multiple facetious jokes.

Thats the only downside if you've had diazepam, these things won't seem quite the same, and as I said I need to do quite a few to get good effects.

Breaking News :D


Gave these a second chance yesterday upon wakening took 4mg so 8 pellets all in at once, no Diazepam or anything else.


I was going out for the day and took a fair bit of fairly strong coke which didn't work obv because I was on these, these things are amazing , pure quality anti-anxiety benzo with very little side effects, I'm not a chemist but that Triazolo thing you can definately tell its there, Iv'e only ever had Xanax once but I remember it like yesterday, 


These things are the closest to Alprazolam I've had yet, I didn't take a single MG of Valium the whole day, didn't even think about it.


To me these are Long Acting - Legal - Xanax - Without Sides !!


Don't know about you guys but I'm stocking my medicine cupboard up, they hut every single spot a benzo should hit, fuck Etizolam with that eye twitching shit, sketchy as fuck , and Diclazepam just doesn't kill the stomach nerves if you are dependant on Benzos, Pyrazolam all the way ! ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


Edit: This is coming from a guy who has been taking diazepam and lot's of other benzos every day for years , been hospitalised through W/D seizures, the lot !

The only worry I have is these getting banned , they are not as cheap as they're made out to be when you add up how many pellets you have to take, the dudes who came up with this obv knew this and that's why they are in 0.5mg form. Just hopefully no idiots try and get a buzz from these and end up ODing, that's what normally causes media attention leading to becoming illegall, I think the buzz chasers won't really be interested in these tho or you'd probably just fall asleep if you took too many.

Getting banned is always a big worry; all it takes is one moron being crazy, and before you know it there's a full-blown moral panic, followed by banning. I just hope they don't apply these analogue laws here. I've been stocking up on stuff like this, just in case....


Great point about the price v dose; they're clever to make the doses so low (I need to take around 8 in a go). I'm looking into buying the drug in powder form

and it seems to be surprisingly cheaper than tablets. What I really wanna do is cut out the middleman and deal with a Chinese wholesaler, but it seems so risky.

I took higher doses than that: 3mg pyrazolam, and 6mg etizolam. I was also on suboxone; the feeling was an incredible calm, and a full-on gouch.

It would be a lot less intense at the dose you described, and the bupe is also a factor.

I've had 6 so far tonight, planning to use up the rest of my supply. Have to be careful I don't get hooked on these RC benzo's....


I think a lot of the people who are getting nothing from these are probably not taking enough; as you said, the vendors are sneaky with doses and making them appear a bargain.


Edit: have you tried this aprazolam? I know they're big in the states, but here it's mostly diaz and temaz (I believe).

Alprazolam is fuckin amense , had it once, best benzo for me ever, just the proper feeling, no anxiety whatsoever, calm as fuck, cool as fuck, mood lifter, clear headed, everything. A lot of people abuse it but I don't abuse benzos man, the feeling I get from just the sheer relief of anxiety is enough "euphoria" for me, Nitrazepam and Temazepam totally different story , hypnotic motherfuckers, don't get me wrong I love them as well like all benzos but Xanax (Alprazolam) defoe my no1 choice for everything. And Pyrazolam is the closest legal thing to it, I'm actually saving up my Diazepam and taking these, got another 250 coming tomorrow ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


Mate be carefull if ur taking Pyraz everyday u WILL become physically dependant and depending on how much youv been taking and how long for there is a very high risk of seizure when ur stash runs out. Trust me.

Yeah, I'm using them occasionaly enough (2-3 days a week). And I prob won't buy any more for a while. Its a worry, cause I get hooked on things fairly easily, and I don't wanna be spending a lot on them, because their not cheap at the doses you need.

Christ that fucking terrible! I've heard some bad experiences with coming off it, but convulsions seems like the very worst reactions; I've heard it can even be fatal...Are NHS providing with the ammount you need to stop you getting so bad? Maybe getting in touch with a drug service could help you; I think benzo addiction is a high priority for these places, and you could get funded for an patient treatment centre.


Btw I'm done with pyraz for a while my eyes are blurry as hell, think I took a bit too much, but the coffee helps keep me awake. Think i need to sleep for a bit....

Sounds like this could also be useful for managing a stim comedown without falling asleep. I get really sketchy after meph or coke sessions where I have to stop re-dosing and stay awake for a while.

This could be perfect for that; they'll calm you down without sedating you. But the doses are small, so you might need to take quite a few to deal with a heavy comedown.

Yeah the fact that Etizolam powder is easily available in my opinion is extremely dangerous. Pyrazolam are quality , Ive been taking 4mg upon wakening with cup of tea in bed (the mrs ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)) and soon as they hit me, on with my day, they last on average 7 hours I reckon, I've got 2000 of them coming tomorrow ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) Happy Days :D

Holy shit! Pretty jealous of you right now; I'm down to my last twenty...

There's always my etizolam stash I guess....


Btw is it safe to use benzos 3-4 days in a row? (I mean to avoid dependence).

Cheers, I'm taking a night off. So far I feel fine, but they're calling my name....

Funnily enough i can take or leave the etiz, it's the pyraz i prefer.


Edit: damnit! I gave into temptation and took some pyraz. I have twelve left; I'll take them tonight, and not be able to have anymore if I like it or not. (I'm broke  for a week). I didn't have a seizure or anything; just knowing they were there drove me crazy....

I've just bought ten of these to give them a try.  I have zero benzo tolerance so this should be just the thing for chilling me out and getting rid of some stress and tension.

Not to downplay benzo addiction or withdrawal at all- I've had 'minor' benzo withdrawal & it was worse than 'upper moderate' opiate withdrawal in sheer unpleasantness (different symptoms obviously, but you know)- but it's a hell of a lot harder to get addicted to benzos than it is to get addicted to opiates. MUCH MUCH harder.


To put things into context- under medical advice (you're having a mental breakdown and genuinely need benzos) it is perfectly acceptable to take a course of *therapeutic* doses for 1-3 months, though they should not be immediately withdrawn & rather tapered down. If you have been taking *therapeutic doses* (no more than the equivalent of ~20mg of diazepam a day) for less than 3-4 months **you will NOT experience benzo withdrawal**. You **will** however experience rebound effects that can be quite unpleasant for 1-2 weeks (insomnia, anxiety, occasional mild tremors) which is wise to both taper off benzos as well as making a genuine effort to not 'rely' on benzos. To continue my 'mental breakdown' example, even if you've been prescribed 10mg diazepam X2 daily you should always make an effort to only take them if you need them- on a good day you should try going without or halving your dose...due to most benzos long half-lives you're unlikely to be completely without benzo metabolites so regularly missing a day is gonna do more good than harm.


Now, everything that I've said only applies to people who are either prescribed short-term (1-3 months) daily benzos or who are prescribed benzos long-term to be used as needed...that is more or less how benzos are prescribed these days, it is exceedingly rare for someone to be put on long-term daily benzo use these days (though it does seem to be far more common in the USA, but that has to do with their entirely privatised medical system rather than best practice). 


The whole point of being prescribed benzos is to help get into a situation where you don't need benzos...it's kinda ironic that benzos are considered excellent anti-anxiety medications (despite their addiction liability) for the very reason that- in conjunction with therapy- taking benzos in a controlled manner result in you *not needing to take benzos anymore!*


Now, if you're abusing benzos (i.e. rapidly developing a massive tolerance due to huge doses/redosing) the situation is different...but it still takes quite a long time of *serious* benzo abuse in order for you to experience minor withdrawal (in addition to normal rebound anxiety/insomnia). To use my experience as any example-


I used a LOT of benzos when I was kicking opiates- for ~10 days I was taking 60mg of diazepam a day + a minimum of 15-25mg of Midazolam plugged (equiv to 45-75mg oral/equal to 60-90mg diazepam) to sleep with 250mg of temazepam also consumed during the 'peak', then I continued taking 20-40mg of diazepam for another 2 weeks. By this point I was completely past the opiate withdrawal and I ran out of diazepam/midazolam & despite my insane doses I only suffered rebound insomnia/anxiety, which was barely noticeable as I was still sleeping badly anyway. I went for ~10 days with no benzos then I obtained 500mg of pure alprazolam powder...I'm not a big fan of alprazolam, I don't like the lack of sedative effects, but the PAWS were starting to hit hard and I went through the alprazolam in about 35 days, averaging 10mg a night to sleep...but when I was having bad opiate cravings/going out on the smash I'd take 20-30mg over the night in 10mg doses. One infamous night I took 40mg...fucking chaos man.


Anyway, once I started to run out I decided that I had to try to taper and not buy any more benzos. I managed to taper down to ~5mg a night to sleep then I had like 3-4 days of bag licking, so 1-2mg doses...then it was cold turkey, just a fat ounce of beautifully manicured cannabis. That DID cause withdrawal, but they were at the minor end of benzo withdrawal- but still worse than minor opiate withdrawal by a long shot. I literally didn't sleep at all for 3 days then only slept in 2-3 hour blocks for about a week...it was actually bad enough that on the third night I actually went and bought a small amount of methadone just so I could sleep (did the trick & didn't cause a relapse) because I was starting to hallucinate slightly from sleep deprivation. I was also angsty as hell, it was like being a teenager again. But you've gotta remember I had been taking the equivalent of 200mg of diazepam nightly, just so I could sleep- I'd take 30mg of alprazolam, snort some ketamine and smoke some spliff and try to convince myself I was nodding at least once a week. I was a fucking trainwreck- as far as I'm concerned I got off *light* considering how badly I abused benzos, particularly alprazolam (which is STILL one of my least favourite benzos FFS!!)


You're smart to be cautious when it comes to messing around with benzos, but as long as you use a little common sense you shouldn't have any problems. Don't take them daily, even at therapeutic doses, for more than week at very most...and if you have a particular need for them (e.g. opiate withdrawal, death of loved one etc) aim to take them for no more than 1-3 months and try hard to be honest with yourself about whether or not you actually *need* to take benzos today.


Withdrawal comes on considerably faster if you obviously abuse them- if you are regularly taking megadoses, particularly of long acting benzos, you are far more likely to experience 'genuine' withdrawal in as little as a month of constant use. Always taper off benzos, it will make the withdrawal considerably less unpleasant/dangerous.


Seizures are NOT common unless you have been dependent on benzos for a prolonged period of time- if you are genuinely at risk of having a seizure due to benzo withdrawal *you will know*. Why? Because you have either been taking benzos multiple times a day for 6 months + or you have been abusing the fuck out of them, taking ten, twenty times the normal dose multiple times a week. You will have bruises on your shoulders from clipping the edges of doorways, you will constantly be hiding things and forgetting where they are, your pants will be covered in stains from various stuff that you've spilt on yourself and your erratic and unpredictable behaviour will be alienating your friends. 


Unless you're experiencing severe benzo withdrawal you are very unlikely to have a seizure...and you're gonna know if you'll experience severe withdrawal if you go without! Seriously, I think half the time people use the 'threat of seizures' as a justification for not doing anything about their benzo dependence until it reaches a point where they **are** at risk of having seizures!


I'm not saying it doesn't happen, but seizures are very rare unless you're either heavily addicted or you've been dependent for ages.

I was surprised to hear the length of time it can take to  become dependent on benzo's.  Of course, psychological dependence can occur a hell of a lot more quickly; they are very "morish" , I guess. When I did my  in-patient detox for alcohol they gave me large doses of librium on a 10 day taper. The detox itself was painless, but I was highly anxious for months afterwards and I've know idea why. I always assumed it was the librium, but I guess that's not it, considering my use was short-term.


Are gabba b agonists effective for withdrawing from gabba a agonists btw? I assumed this was the reason they give benzos to people in alcohol dt's....

If so, maybe the reverse is true; maybe using a gaba b agonist (phenibut for example) could help detox from a benzo.


Of course, I know jack shit about chemistry.


Edit: I wonder why big pharma don't have their grasping claws on these things yet? If they do, we can kiss goodbye to our beloved RC suppliers. Possibly a patent thing...?

limonov-


Thank you for your story. That is crazy - you seem like a super-strong person to go through that.


You mention continue use of benzos, ie; continued use for 1-3 months. Now , What is your opinion on using them occasionally for extended periods (years)?   For instance, once a week, or once every two / three weeks- even months, for when it's really needed. like going on a first date, or meeting girls. 


no benzo works for me, except Valium and Etizolam. Valium has a very small anti-anxiety effect, so I don't do it any more, but 1mg of Etizolam does wonders.   Last time i did Etizolam was 14 days ago. No withdrawal. 


I think if suffer from depression, always thought it was anxiety though. I masked it for 3 years with opiates- I never got addicted, I kept use to once a week for when I went out to parties or something social.. Amazing?


I am now doing the same with Etizolam as I just don't want to fall into a trap with opiates. 


Maybe I should talk to a doctor, but what can they really do? Nothing I'd assume


Are there any anti-depressants that work just like tramadols snri effect? Are there anti-depressants that you don't have to take everyday for them to work? I don't like putting drugs into my body every single day. But tramadol's snri effects seems to work right off the bat - And I really miss that. Not the opioid effect.

Hi there zzz101, there are many, many ssri/snri's on the market right now; they are the decades "wonder drug", after all, and are being pushed heavily by the pharm companies. I've no idea the difference between SSRI and SNRI drugs, but I've been on SSRI's for six years now, and they're excellent for depression, and I mean great.


I was originaly taking citralopram, but they made me restless and it was hard to sleep on them. I now take mirtazipine, they are a relatively poweful sedative, and also an appetite enhancer. (I've gained weight!)


None of these drugs (ssri's at least) kick in instantly; it can take quite a long time for the brain to regulate it's serotonin to normal levels, even with ssri assistance)For me, it took around 6 weeks, but the effects can last months, even if you stop taking the drug, so it's not vital you take it every day.

My first SNRI was Effexor, It took effect pretty quick but my system had to get used to it. The first few days i felt like I took a very low dose MDMA I even had dilated pupils, which was awkward as people around me started to notice and thought I was also more customer friendly than usual =)

After a few weeks it evened out and worked great especially at dosage above 150mg (aditional norepenephrine action i believe) 

BUT... Forget a daily dose and expect to pay the price, instant withdrawal syndrome resulting in freaky brain-zaps, some head aches and an overall hung over miserable feeling.


I have ADD and during this time I was also taking Concerta (Methylphenidate) during this period of about 8 years.


If I took my meds and made sure to have my precription renewed in time, (weekends without Effexor are hell and I also remember raising hell at the pharmacy when my script wasn't ready too) 

I was on top of the world. Things were going better and better. 

Only...eventually after a year or so, my girlfriend started complaining I was losing interest in her.. Although this had multiple reasons... decreased libido was part of it.


I figured what the hell everything is going super smooth, it's time to quit and get on with business, so I did. A week taper halving my dose and then a few days prozac. I was my usual self and behaving like the old dog again, gf didn't complain neither did anyone else.

Things seemed fine. In hind sight they were not.


Depression and social anxiety slowly crept back in and I became less confident, this combined with a fresh coke habit which made me a bit paranoid, I fucked up at a lot of things while still riding the wave to sucess that had already lost momentum. 


Anyway...almost back on topic guys...

I figured I made a bad desicion so started Citalopram an SSRI my doc said would probably keep my libido intact..It did but didn't do anything else either, thinking it might take some time again I stayed on it for quite a while, but eventually I was still not the vibrant and more confident me and was dissatisfied with the results I got from Citalopram.(except the nice vivid dreams)


As I was no longer with my girlfriend I decided to give Effexor another go as I was desperate to get out of this hole I had further dug for myself and I had become quite lethargic. I hadn't been this depressed before and Effexor certainly didn't have the same effectiveness as the first time I was on It. (this seems to happen when people have quit Effexor before)


Also I thought my levels of Serotonin were either too low or not having much effect due to a more pronounced depression and lack of sleep. Also, when I would take melatonin, I still couldn't sleep well, only briefly to wake up extremely foggy headed. A visit to a sun tan fixed this. I stopped using Melatonin with Effexor after that, but when I was off I tried again, with the same result: dull headed when waking up, tanning studio worked better than coffee.


So I started reading in to my meds and the first thing I discovered were articles regarding up-regulation of receptors and that long term Methylphenidate causes upregulation of dopamine receptors causing basic reward stimuli no longer being experienced as such but more or less only triggering fight or flight response resulting in fear and apathy in general, because one is no longer rewarded accordingly... 


Could this percieved shortage or loss of effectiveness and longer discontinuation syndrome be caused by up-regulation by k-Opiod receptors?

These detect abnormally high levels of neurotransmitters and kind of make receptors less sesitive to protect the brain from posible toxic high levels. Down regulation on the other hand is painfully slow...Perhaps long term SNRI use also triggers adjustment in sensitivity?


More research seems being done now and it seems a more logical aproach to modify KOR instead of the underlying mechanism. From what I understand with the little knowledge of neurology I have gathered in the last few months SSRI's, SNRI's, and to an extent all medication that chronically create a surplus of a neurotransmitter will (with extended use?) cause the k-Opiod system to upregulate the relevant receptors, causing misery down the (longer) road.


Are there exeptions or has modern medicine been prodding away in our mysterious skulls once again, just to learn they almost got it but not quite? 


For ones who like to experiment:

Sub perceptual micro-doses (2 dried leaves 0.5 gr) or if you like the effect a lager dose of Salvia Divinorum seem to have a long lasting antidepressent and anxiolytic effect (a few days to a week) due to k-opiod agonism.


[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2721268/](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2721268/)


Anyway I stopped taking Concerta and Effexor and after a more prolonged and nasty withdrawl from the latter (brain zaps for 3 weeks tried suplementing with 5-htp at first (when off for a few days) with little effect, so after that didnt work, the next day and after that took 5 mg Citalopram when they got really annoying It has been 3.5 weeks now it used to last only a few days last time. But it seems my mind is almost back to normal and feel much better now and I look forward to experiencing some fun times again! 


But finally back on topic: 


How does Pyrazolam's withdrawl potential compare to Etizolam? 


As I felt like crap today: lack of apetite, nausia, insomnia, just blegh.. You know.

But these symptoms could be very well related to the stuff mentioned above or does a general nasty wheezy stale feeling sound familiar? Would you say i'm having withdrawal of the soul shattering type or the 'you probably shouldn't take 3 or 4 in one go kid' kind? XD

I have been nibling a couple now an then (2mg at night to get some sleep) for the last 2 months maybe 50-60 intas in total although I am a bit surprised at the amount, I hardly munched a strip at a time.. All super responsive a few days on then a few days off etc..  I rarely If ever take more than 3 days in a row as I also have other things to take, do.


-How close to trouble am I walking Is there still hope for me?

-Do I need to get all drastic and taper or just take a few weeks off?


Update:

I brazenly took 1mg Etizolam around 04:00 and I felt slightly better, but not much.


I didn't want to take more as it might be better not to, and at some point one must go to sleep without the aid of mental lubricants.


(I mainly use them for sleeping and 1mg of Pyrazolam also did the job just fine probably even better as I woke up with a clear head, would switching up have aditional benefits regarding dependency/half life/side effects?)


I will probably stay awake and try to have a good early sleep tonight to get back into the groove.


Hell maybe I have some totally unrelated funky ailment and I'm posting for all the wrong reasons, but I think I already feel an improvement underway. 


(If this was too much of topic. I apologize feel free to move when needed)

I'm glad to hear you're getting it together. You obviously have more ssri exp than me,(I've only had citralopram and mirtazipine), and that effexor sounds scary as fuck! Brain zaps after missing one day....? Shit. I can miss my mirt for a week and feel fine. You seem to know your AD's; what exactly is the difference between ssri and snri?


Regarding pyraz WD's, I haven't a clue- I've only started them recently. You're on a very low dose, so that will play a major role (I gobble them like sweeties; I did 12 yesterday, the last of my stash). Some people are saying these new rc benzos are easier to come off and slower to form a tolerance than "traditional" benzos, but there's very little hard data. It's frustrating. You may possibly experience some rebound anxiety and reduced sleep quality? Anyway, it's very good you're on a low dose. I suggest you PM mydrugbuddy; he's tapering from rc benzo's, and knows his stuff.


Edit: Sorry, I just read that you're careful to cycle; very wise. I really wouldn't worry too much, I think you'll be fine. I'm also a bit worried: I've been using pyraz and etiz way too much, around 4-5 day's at a time, large doses. I've given my stash to somebody I trust, and will use phenibut to cope with rebound anxiety.

20mg Diazepam per day W/D WILL cause seizure !!!! Never read the full post but it will !! You need to get your hands on lowest doze of valium/librium possible that takes the cravings away then very slowly lower it at extremely tiny doses over a long period of time, sorry if this is already covered but after the shit I been through I always need to warn people that they WILL take seizures.

Thank you for your in-sight . I might stay away from trying anti-depressants for now. Going to try out St John's wort tomorrow. waiting a day longer as two days ago had 2.5mg Etizolam over 2 days. I can still feel its effects well into the next day. That's when the depression starts. It's pretty horrible. And now I'm feeling a bit of relief that the depression is almost over (hope it's not a mood swing?) But it felt like Tuesday blues to a T.    I will not be taking Etizolam again. It makes me depressed. It's not withdrawal.  


Etizolam would be so awesome if it wasn't for that. 


I want to try Pyrazolam, will post my experiences if i ever do.

I'm thinking of switching from Diazepam to just Pyrazolam, it works a million times better for me, Diazepam is only good in stupid doses, not sure how this would affect me going from a up to 200 hours half life to a 8 hour half life with no metabolites because I've had seizures one being deadly,


most people do the opposite to detox, I'm on a Detox just now but I think I'm just gna be honest with the Psychiatrist and tell him I've been using these and show him the chemical structure next to Alprazolam chemical structure (almost identical)


I'm currently at 30mgs of valium per day wich just does not work, I think the half life is far too long for me to feel the proper effects of it, and I MUCH prefer the clear headed, mood lifting, no sedation that Pyrazolam does , I do still get little cravings for the typical muscle relaxants Librium, Valium (amazing combination for me for the stomach nerves)


No idea what the doc would do if I told him about the Pyraz, he can't cut me off because I was put on the programme on leaving the hospital through the massive seizure I took, I don't believe you can get Alprazolam on the NHS, so no idea how he would react, playing with my head a bit actually thinking about it , to be honest or not to be honest.

It's always a dilemma re honesty: you get some real hard case docs out there, it all depends on your past experience with him. Why not make the switch to pyraz, and just not use the diazepam but cash the scripts? (Probably terrible advice, I know). It's funny you mention Librium; I believe it actualy contains amitryptaline, funnily enough, at least according to wiki.

Librium was the 1st ever Benzodiazepine (Chlordiazproxide) Alcholics are given it for the shakes it has the exact same half life as Diazepam , Diazepam is one of it's metabolites and that's how benzos began, I really like Librium and Valium together, 2 classics, and can't forget the old Temazepam I'd love a few of them right about now, DOPEMEGENTLY  empty ur inbox so I can pm u back mate ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

I tell you what those librium are perfect for alcohol withdrawals. When I did my detox a while back they eliminated almost all dt's. I was on a 7 day taper, starting on very high doses. It's funny-I noticed not a single effect from the librium whatsoever......none at all.

I think because Diazepam is a metabolite of Librium it potentiates it so you get the full effect , I would swap a valium for Librium any day of the week , both 2gether are a much better combination for me anyway, I've actually thought of just trying a high dose of Librium it's the stomach nerves that it kills just pure relief for me , I could go some right now lol

It seems to be very hard to obtain. By the sound of it, it's only used for alcoholism the se days (although I could be wrong). It's interesting that it was the very first type of benzo and it's still used. I have to be careful; I'm using these rc benzos too much lately, I'm quite worried actualy.


BTW U may need to re-send your pm benzoman, as my inbox isn't showin any new 'uns.

I'll do that now, yeah mate u obv like benzos for whatever reasons but if u aint got a script to back it up when u run out ur fucked, if Etiz if ur favourite use it twice a week , or Pyraz , that would be ok, not sure about the half life on the Diclaz its defoe longer tho Etiz is short and Pyraz is about 8 hours with no metabolites, do u smoke weed ?

Yeah, got your pm. I havn't smoked for a few months, but I have a deal with a mate: he grows high grade misty (you've never seen so many crystals 

Its proper). The deal is he keeps the good stuff- the bud etc, and I get everything else for free! I'll get shopping bags full of leaf at a time. Obviously leaf is usualy shite, but this stuff...it's far, far superior to soapbar. (I think a lof of the crystals fall onto it or something). I'm not a big fan myself, I'll smoke a few times a month with a beer maybe.


Anyways, I'm gonna go 2 days without a benzo, see what happens.


Edit: did 10 etiz monday, 8 tuesday, 6 tonight.(I'm all out till my powder arrives) From what I gather a taper is still important even for short term use.

Ok here's my 2 cents worth on Pyrazolam and benzos, but first some background..


I suffer with chronic social anxiety and have taken Diazepam and Xanax on prescription (and my fair share of generic versions of these which can have variable effects), plus I use Etizolam regularly for sleep. So I know my benzo's and the dosage, the effects they have, both for anxiety relief and for sedation/sleep..


I obtained Pyrazolam (yellow pills scored from a well known RC vendor) as it looked like a cheaper and possibly good alternative to Xanax (my favourite benzo of choice for social anxiety and the most effective for me). I had high hopes for it, because of the longer half-life (9-11 hrs compared to Xanax < 6 hrs) and it's supposed to be less sedating than Xanax at higher doses..


Some have described Pyrazolam as "Xanax-lite". I would position it somewhere between Xanax and Diazepam in terms of effects, which are quite subtle and creep up on you. It does seem to have typical onset time if taken orally (40mins-1hr), despite claims of a fast onset. 


It's quite weird actually how Pyrazolam works and difficult to put into words.. the only way I can describe it is like imagine a steep curve... at the bottom flat part (on 0.5mg) you have mild anxiety relief akin to 5-10mg diazepam (but without any sedation)... then suddenly, bam, if you up the dose of Pyrazolam (1.5mg-2mg) expecting more anxiety-relief, you're knocked out and sleeping.


So, for me, it is nowhere near as effective as Xanax for anxiety. Simply no comparison. If you're suffering bad social anxiety and expecting this to do for you what Xanax does, save your money and buy Xanax instead.


Yes, it has some type of benzo effect and you feel less anxiety (and sedated/sleep inclined at higher doses) but it's definitely not as precise and effective as Xanax is at targeting anxiety for me.. Xanax has a much faster onset too for me (especially if taken sublingually, i.e. dissolved under tongue)


Compared to Pyrazolam, Xanax not only removes anxiety totally for me but even makes me social. It doesn't sedate either at low to mid dosage (0.5mg-1mg), whereas Pyrazolam just takes the edge off anxiety, so I have to re-dose and end up crashing and sleeping on 1-1.5mg.


That said, experiences and effects tend to vary a lot with benzos. People use them for different reasons and have different tolerance levels of expectations in terms of the effects. I wouldn't dismiss Pyrazolam as benzo, but I also wouldn't say it's a great alternative to Xanax (or Diazepam for that matter) due to it being unlicensed, RC status and safety questions..


Here's how I use benzos:


1. Extreme Social Anxiety = Xanax (0.5 - 2mg)

2. Combat re-bound anxiety/withdrawals when not taking Xanax = Diazepam (5mg)

3. Sleep = Etizolam (0.5mg)


Two comments/warnings I would like to make for those new to benzo's..


1. Xanax - not really a daily/long-term solution for social anxiety due to its short half-life, tolerance develops, dependency and withdrawal risks. 

2. Etizolam - if used daily for sleep, serious risk of Blepharospasms (eyelid spasms leading to droopy eyelids).


I have experienced both the above:


1. I now need repeated dosing of Xanax to get the same effects (I started on 0.5mg and now need 2mg, years on) and experience severe re-bound anxiety sometimes if I don't take it.

2. After using Etizolam nightly for 12 months, I have begun experiencing eyelid spasms that come and go, which is worrying.

I am a big fan of Xanax , sever anxiety like yourself, 2mg is my sweet spot , iI have been taking 4mg Pyraz every morning as soon as I wake up for the last wee while, and my tolerance has risen but I am not going over 4 (learned to respect these drugs) , I think you maybe had a bad day , maybe worth another go especially if your a Xanax man, either that or it just does something different to you as we are all different, 


As far as Etiz is concerned I got facial muscle spasms the SECOND TIME I used it, sketchy as fuck, that was on 5mg tho, people may see that as a high dose, I think 1mg Etiz mixed with 4mg Pyraz would make a nice Xanax Alternative ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


Edit: Just thought I'd mention Etiz makes me behave foolishly and brave at high doses, I think all the Etiz lovers are gna have horror story's in a couple of years, with that eye twitching shit , already read a couple.

HEyy all..my rhesus monkey just heard that his O'l uncle Bill the Rhesus monkey had sent off a package of 10 1mg Pyrazolam & 10 2mg diclazepam . Rhes is quite happy to hear that these benzo treats are on the way as they should serve to go well with the other batch of treats on the way..which is consisting of sum mephedrone and sum o-acetylpsilocin Alll of these substances will be completely new for monkey, he has not touched RC's since  0'10 when sum etizolam and aMT fell his way.


But Rhes is super pumped for this Pyrazolam he hopes for good things..with the same hoped for diclazapam ..rhes hasn't had much benzos as of late..as he has been staying relatively clean since rejoining the methadone program.

my monkey knows all the dangers associated with methadon+benzo cocktails and what can happen..and he assures me that the utmost care and vigilance.

etizolam is so much better and you can get it in pharmaceutical form unlike pyrazolam which only has a mild anxiolytic effect. etizolam hits much harder and recreational wise has the nice muscle relaxation and sedation.

^^ exactly what i came here to ask.   does pyraz have any of the muscle relaxation that say klonopin does for example.  sounds like pyraz sucks for benzo tolerant peeps. except for certain cases i suppose.


i wonder now which is more muscle relaxing: diclazepam or etizolam

I've known benzo tolerant people who've had a great time on pyraz, it's all in the dosage; those standard 0.5 doses are miniscule, even for somebody without a tolerance. So just expect to need to buy larger amounts of tablets. I have a minor tolerance, and it takes me at least 3mgs to get positive effects from them.


Oh yeah SlumSurvivor, I missed your last pm 'cause my inbox was full; I have room in there now.

What are the therapeutical doses?

Does it have good anxiolytic properties? What's the half-life?

How fast is the onset?

What's the black out factor on this substance?

Haven't done em for months now. I believe the powder is available from a few UK and EU vendors, but these are only for "advanced customers" whatever the hell that means. I'm presuming its for big spenders only. I'll buy some when it becomes available to me; the purposely low doses being punted mean you need to do a lot of pills-it's not cost efficient. I'm not sure if there are "branded" pyraz or not, I've only had generics. In fact, my vendors entire range of benzos are generic. I've heard a lot of bad reviews on generic pills, but every one I've had has been excellent quality. They're also significantly cheaper than blistered pills. Btw is there any such thing as blistered pyraz, such as intas or etizest for example?


Right now, I've got 250 diclazepam on order, because I'm bored of etizolam. At the right I use them that's a 3 month supply. I really like the sound of these; they last a solid 12 hours, meaning I'd need to dose once, they're supposed to also be good sedatives with muscle-relaxation properties. They haven't had rave reviews, but I'm still optimistic.

It's weird the very first two I took gave me strong sedative effects, which I can't explain. But the next time I took it as a person with zero tolerance, it took me 3mg to get those classic pyrazolam effects; superb lack of anxiety with zero sedation. So, I love pyraz, but I need to use too damn many of them. I could try a new vendor I guess, but I trust mine to deliver quality gear.

I have to say if I only take 1 tab before work or something similiar, its working like  charm. But today I took 2 0.5 Tabs and maaan dat sedation is heavy. 

Its Strange cause I allready have a good amount of benzo tolerance.


And in addition to that I took 3 pyras at my last friday and it felt exact like the two I havev eating this morning. 


Any one knows a different between the white and he yellow tabs ? 

IMO the yellow tabs were way more effectiv as a good anxiolytic.


Sry for poor grammar ^^

Depends on where it comes from (pills), just got 250 sent my way for less than £40, which IMO is pretty reasonable.

Pyrazolam is a Xanax Potentiator, I imagine same with any Triazolo, for people wohe only use the Triazolo type, good for the medicine cupboard.

Aye.


I've actually no experience with the other triazole ring substituted benzos, as I'm from the UK myself, and according to my GP's psychotropic prescribing manual (no, I am not a GP, but its a very useful reference guide, came in handy when I specifically wanted info on chlormethiazole, which I'm scripted for seizures of the myoclonic type), and alprazolam is blacklisted here, not sure if triazolam is, but any sensible GP wouldn't prescribe it, other than perhaps for a short term single dose as sedation prior to an intrusive or difficult to cope with procedure. I sure wouldn't prescribe it, were I a doctor, without very, very special cause to do so)


But I quite like pyrazolam, in spite of my usual benzo preference if I do get any, being for nitrazepam. Always found it capable of knocking me out cold with a bare minimum of effort, despite being scripted the chlormethiazole.

Hm, I wouldn't know, having never used a private doctor.  A-I'm poor, and B-my NHS-trained GP is a wonderful, compassionate guy, without an attitude problem (E.g 'I'm the doctor here, I know what I'm talking about and ONLY I know what I'm talking about), so I can discuss things on an equal footing, and if one of the two of us needs an explanation of something the other can give it and know they will be listened to.


Considering I'm a pain patient on strong meds for a bad set of joints that is a blessing I know I'm lucky to have, especially with also being on multiple other meds that are, or potentially could be considered desirable.


If I get the chance to try alprazolam, of course I will bioassay it, likewise triazolam. But 250 pyrazolam tabs will last me a LOOOOOOOOOOOONG time.

I ordered x 10 a few weeks back - thought I'd give 'em a bash. I took x2 and I felt quite loose and relaxed but not sedated. I thought they were quite good. Then Boom, nothing else whatsoever. Downed the other 10 and it's as if they just stopped working. :-/

I actually quite like pyrazolam although I reckon the tablets could possibly have been 1mg; a lot don't rate it but it's quite pleasant in a mild way; doesn't seem to have the muscle relaxing effect or little but still a great hypnotic without the knockout effect

It wouldn't so ideal for halting a major trip but I took a load towards the end of a good dose of shrooms and they were pretty noticable and a nice slide down

Pyrazolam is a good Benzo for me, there is no doubt about it, it like my Xanax alternative, beause it is a triazolo and the chemical structure is almost the same, it definitely is not the same, but for those times when I'm in a sticky situation, moments of madness etc where I would sublingually take 2mg Xanax, gubbing 4mg Pyrazolam can calm me down much the same because it is also water soluble so the second it hits the stomach it starts taking effect and it lasts a few hours as well, it really is an innocent benzo with no side effects or metabolites, perfect for the person with acute social anxiety for a one off every now and again, it is not a recreational drug at all !!


But.. try taking Etiz with it , haha 4mg Etiz with 4mg Pyraz creates a hole new drug ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) Well it felt good when I done it anyway.

Ordered a large amount of these whilst blacked out after 3 flurobrazepam (zero tolerance).


I suffer with GAD and have found that just 1 0.5mg pellet (yellow) a really excellent anxiolytic, makes me feel like a regular guy and not some para-zombie.


Have tried up to 1.5g with booze and didn't notice much synergy.


Some joker said that mg insufflated is nice and its made me a lil loopy, but I spose if you like that sort of thing then crack on.

Burn is bad tho, not MDMA bad but way worse than ket IMO.


I mostly want to use these for therapeutic reasons, so far I have taken them 6 days running but no more than 2mg total which is 4 pellets.


Generally I think my use will be a max of 1mg a day


Is this is safe? How many days should or can you use without developing tolerance at these levels

Doing grams of a substance that is active at 0,5 mg is definitely not safe, and mixing sedative-hypnotics with other downers like booze is a big no-no, especially in those dosages.

Aye, these arent strong by any means. If you are an anxiety sufferer though they are excellent, reduces anxiety with little to no side effects, maybe a wee touch groggy in the morning but nothing a cup of coffee camt fox.


Very little recreational value though, which is a good thing for me i guess =]

The comments in this thread always really surprised me. I really liked these. The strangest thing though is how I see everyone saying Etizolam is better and then saying that's because Pyrazolam isn't recreational - when for me it was almost the opposite. (not quite, Etiz is lovely and recreational, but Pyraz feels more silly and upbeat) 


Etizolam was always great, nice and chill, real lovely relaxation, and was always awesome for dealing with anxiety, getting to sleep, or dealing with comedowns/hangovers.


Pyrazolam on the other hand is more uplifting and bright feeling, and a little silly - kinda like Diazepam (another favourite of mine). There's nice muscle relaxation like Diazepam too, and it lacks the heavier stone of more sedating benzos like Midazolam etc.


Personally I've tried quite a few benzos now and not found one that I didn't enjoy - but Pyrazolam is definitely one of the better ones I've tried. It made for a nice mixer with opiates too, a tad less risky than more sedating benzos - but this isn't a combo you should attempt, just me posting my experiences. I was always careful with such mixes at the time and yet I still could have easily gotten hurt, so yeah.


Some of the benzos (including etiz in the list) I've tried are:

Clonazepam

Etizolam

Midazolam

Diazepam

Diclazepam

Pyrazolam


And a few others. 


Out of those, Diclazepam and Midazolam are best for sleep/potentiating/stoning body highs - though Diclaz has a bit more of that clear uplifting high like Diazepam - Etizolam was always hands down the best at calming me down even if I was having the world's worst panic attack ready to explode - and Pyrazolam and Diazepam are the nice happy positive ones to chill with friends, be a bit silly, and party - or go about a normal day on a low dose completely avoiding any normal stresses or anxieties. :D


(didn't comment on Clon because I only tried it once during an MDPV comedown and remember little of it)


Oh, just to add though, if you're one for the more sedating benzos like Midazolam, Temazepam etc - you probably won't like Pyrazolam, unless taken in fairly high doses. It's more of a daytime benzo. The kind of thing that you could take if you have anxiety and want to treat it without being impaired - or for partying where you really don't want to get sleepy like many benzos would get you.

About 8 hours roughly, they are really nice if you just want a genuine anxiety destroyer, bear in mind the chemical structure is almost exactly the same as Alprazolam (Xanax), they are like an extended release very mild version of Xannies , it has been said a couple of times.

Wouldn't even compare 0.5 to any amount of Xanax TBH, I think 1mg of Pyraz = slightly under 0.5mg Alpraz ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

I'm happy with what this chem does.


I've mentioned it somewhere else (hopefully not in this thread, lol) on BL.


I get daily head pressures from something anxiety related, pyraz demolishes this pressure. Makes certain situations a lot more bearable working day to day. 


With other benzos I have to dose a lot lower to achieve this, I think it has to do with more sedation, causing more issues for my head pressure. With pyraz it's a really clean experience for me, no mind fog, no forgetfulness, no f@&#ing head pressure!

Really?! I didn't know that, and honestly that shocks me....


Well that proves to me once and for all that similarity of chemical structure is no indication whatsoever of similarity of subjective effects, because in my subjective experience those two benzos could be polar opposites! 


I detest aplrazolam because it removes ALL my emotions and leaves me feeling stupified and about as human as a brick. Pyrazolam on the other hand does one thing only - removes anxiety. In my experience, having tried around ten different benzos, pyraz is the only one that has this super targeted effect. 


In my eyes, it is the paradigm of what a benzo should be: something that negates anxiety without disrupting other faculties. I believe it's the safest benzo available and I have wondered why this isn't the gold standard medication in the treatment of anxiety. 


Of course, as I've said before, people have radically different reactions to drugs, and nowhere else does this seem to be so vividly demonstrated as in the field of benzos. It's truly amazing how different people's subjective experiences are with this class of drug. I mean, all drugs elicit different reactions in people, but it's usually within certain parameters - *degrees* of difference. With benzos it seems that people can have any and all kinds of experience, they are simply so unpredictable. 


That's why everyone needs to exercise extreme caution when advising others on benzo related matters. Drawing on one's own subjective experience of a certain benzo can be entirely irrelevant to another person.

From what I've read it seems that this substance is mainly available in the form of pellets. I was wondering if anyone has came across pure pyrazolam powder? I have a couple vendors who take requests and thought this one may help me lower my etizolam intake. I find it strange that there is an abundance of etizolam/phenazepam powder while the rest are usually sold as pellets.

When I'm out of hospital, I'm thinking of giving this stuff a crack. I wonder why I am always compelled to try new benzos when I already know of and can get hold of quite a few good ones? Hm.

Alprozam powder is super easy get if you use your noggin. I love Pyrazolam just ordered 100 with 100 Etizolam.. But using the logic of "chemical structure is similar...therefore backing up that effects are similar" is ridiculous and bad science. The two drugs are both good for anxiety but feel completely different. You will only get disappointed going into pyrazolam expecting xanax like buzz.

For me it's the other way round, pyraz seems to leave my body very quickly, unlike diclaz and fubromazepam. 


Yesterday morning I consumed 4 of the flubromazepams as I had a doctor's appointment and just having to sit in a waiting room stresses the living shit out of me, afterwards I got on my daily kratom(I use it for maintenance).


Anyway at some point in the afternoon, I started being bored, given that I'm on anti-biotics I decided not to drink, I foolishly tried to get a buzz off the yellow pyrazolams, between lunchtime and bedtime I have consumed 16 of them, as in 16 pellets, one of them was crushed and snorted.


This morning I got up fresh as a rose. Something similar happened last week, same thing, no problem, getting up in the morning, I guess they are perfect for people with jobs, they don't make you look fucked up, don't give you slurrish benzo speech, don't make you stumble around like the village drunk from an Irish novel. Perfect


Of all the benzos I have tried I find them the easiest to wake up in the morning.


A few weeks ago I played around with some diclazepam, took the last one after dinner then dozed off watching a film, I only woke up the next day when my mother came back from work, which means that I was probably asleep for almost 20 hours.


Anyway I'm down to my last 4 pyrazolams, I think I will crush them and snort a couple of monster lines. Sorry nose, but you suffered worst when I was doing ethylphenidate everyday. Unless I find something around the house I can plug them with.


Later guys

hey guys im new here, 


just wondering if anybody else here has tried high doses of pyrazolam, maybe i have a cross over tolerance from etizolam, but I've taken 24 pyraz, 0.5mg = 12 mg total) in the last 34 hours just to try and keep a nice anxiety reduction level .. I did get a nice sleep in between though. but yeah it seems i have to double or tripple drop to get any of these effect, but they make no difference on my mood really. 


but i was wondering what the limit is, seeing as they are sold in halves you feel really guilty taking 4 at a time, if anybody else has tried? and what side effects that might have. if anybody has experience?

Expect all the typical niceties of benzodiazepine overuse, including memory loss, decreased coordination, and the potential for injury and seizures, paranoia, malaise, intense anxiety in withdrawal.

Hi all! New to forum &#55357;&#56835; i was vey interested in trying the chem when i read about its anoxilic effects as i do suffer from anxiety, and yes i i dont need to be lectured on abusing them etc i am pretty sensible. I wanted to use it to try and take the edge off when walking in a busy place for example which i tend to get anxious about or on busy trains etc. 


I have tried etizolam before however didn't find it calmed me or my racing thoughts in the evening, worrying about things that have happened/bad day at work etc i usually just had half once a week maybe but I found it too sedating to be used fuctionally to help with angst.


My bloke introduced me to the world of drugs, sensibly btw i was very interested he has a fair bit of expereince whereas me, just a handful of times. Anyway me n my bloke have had etiz plenty of times, him more then me, and we tried pyrazolam saturday in the day and went out for lunch, i had 1mg he had 0.5, however the effects were pretty unexpected, it took around an hour or so to feel anything, my bloke describes it as being similar to being stoned, i felt like not wanting to do anything, tiredness, a 'heavy body' type feeling, slighty floaty, faily calm, it was fairly nice tbh. I was expecting a big releif of angst but it didnt seem to happen as i was still nervous asking for the bill for our lunch etc, though i did chat more then usual to the waitress. My bloke said he wasnt too keen on the pyraz and that its something he would have for sleep.


Me however will try it again, sunday night i tried half and felt no effects an hour later, so had the other half - 0.5mg, and didnt feel that same feeling as i had on saturday, tolerence maybe?? I didnt notice any effects to be honest Sunday night, but maybe it was hard to tell as i was at home and not in an angst provoking situation, though i was worrying about monday morning and did have some angst about the day and took the pyraz to see if it would calm me for sleep and get rid of the angst like alot of other posters have said. I didnt get that sedated on it either though i do think it gave me a good sleep. Felt anxious today, rebound angst??? Anyway will try it again at weekend maybe to check whether sunday nights effects or rather, non effects were due to tolerence or something


Oh the 'stoned' type effects on Saturday didn't last too long a few hours at most, i don't know about the anoxilic effects as i was home before the stoned effects fully wore off so after those initial stoned type feelings maybe it could help with anxiety.


Sorry for my spelling i mean 'anxiolytic' - anti angst

tried this again today, day off work wahoo! Wanted to see what anxiolytic effects it would have whilst out. I took 0.5mg then went out with my mother somewhere (no she didn't know id had anything) i felt a little spaced out. I had another 0.5 about an hour and half later and felt a little bit more spaced out, and did feel calmer. Felt tired also. 

I'm beginning to think that from reading others' reports that maybeee this batch i got isn't great, i really don't want that feeling of being sedative or spacey, i purely wanted the anxiolytic effects, most things i have read about this says its great for relieving anxiety, which i think it did to a point but its hard to tell as i felt fairly tired. Though i had a flubromazepam for the first time last night, which made me very tired... not etizolam feeling at all just a heavy tired feeling and woke up feeling still slightly tired/spacey this morn which must still be on my system as i felt a little odd when i fot up. I thought seeing as tho pyraz isn't supposed to have much sedative/hypnotic effects i would tryit whilstput - times when i get anxios. I think it helped eith angst a little bit but again, i felt a little spaced out and tired. 

Will buy some more from a different site and see how they go with me.

This sounds like a wonder drug for anxiety, similar to bromazapam but shorter lasting? Is this available in the US from a shop or is it underground? Haven't found much info by googling.

Does anyone know if Pyrazolam is interchangable and fully substitutable with other benzos please ? Particularly thieno thingies like etizolam? I wouldnt want to become addicted to 2 different classes of benzos?


 Im allready addicted to etiz, and am finding pyrazolam preferable for taking at a new job at work as its not too strong as a sedative, but works great for anxiety.

Most of them are highly cross tolerant. If you're dependant on one and in withdrawals from say etizolam, valium would stop it and vice versa. I'm pretty damn sure of this, but someone correct me if they don't quite have the cross tolerance I think they do.


In other words, you can't be dependant on valium and etizolam and stop the valium and increase the dose of etizolam and be in withdrawal, they're both gabagerics, and the withdrawal is from messing with the same GABA receptors.

thanks for the second opinion, i kind of hoped this was the case, and thought that it would be pretty unlikely to be possible to become addicted to 2 different types of benzos, but just wanted to get some more opinions to increase my peace of mind, and to make sure i wasnt going to unecessarily create twice the problems for myself. Etizolam does hit exactly the same receptors that traditional benzos do so it makes sense that it will be cross tolerant with other benzos.

Imo if taken regularly it's the same as other benzos. However since it lacks recreational effects it's much easier to stick to 'as needed' dosing. Because trying to get high with it is futile.

research of 2.5mg over 3 hours proves great in subjects. anxiolytic properties but no recreational value. As expected. This can be used for work if you can't get a normal benzo that helps you or find the ones you get a script for to be to hypnotic or brain foggy. Every individual is different.


EDIT: if taken a lot this could certainly cause WD or rebound anxiety but like black53 said it's easier to stick to 'as needed' doses.


Final EDIT: added 1mg etizolam pink football branded kind to my research and ingested my medical cannabis hash oil tincture, slept until it all left my system woke promptly at 630am. Got about 6 hours sleep.

it is certainly cross tolerant. and don't let its relative lack of recreational effects, it can induce withdrawals.


i thought it would be a good tapering benzo.

I just got 50, already took my daily Etizolam so I will have to wait until tomorrow morning to try them. Silly prices at the moment, wondering if there's a big cull of this industry coming. Smaller than the Etizolam pellets I got from the (V-WORD), bright yellow.


Really hoping for a longer lasting Etizolam, or something that resembles Xanax, so much hype and hysteria around that drug - heard it gives you superman like confidence but at a price.

Have to agree with the consensus in this thread after trying them, seem to kill the nerves dead but lack the euphoria of Etizolam. So this is Xanax lite hmm, might be handy if you are facing a stressful situation but I prefer the warm fuzzy feeling that Etizolam give. If they end up getting banned I might buy a load. Weird dreams, not as weird as Propranolol but, I do like dreams.

Gah, you should have went with clonazolam 0.5mg pills, they're going on somewhere for cheap is all I can say here. And I'm not mincing my words, it is very cheap compared to every other rc benzo out there, from what I know anyways.


Pyrazolam sounds like clorazepate, better than oxazepam but not by much and very functional, like clorazepate, clorazepate has to turn into nordiazepam in your liver, so it's kind of an effect-less valium until it's processed by the body. So yeah it takes longer to kick in, but that's as close as a legal benzo I could compare it to. I thought about triazolam, because it's either 50-50 about how euphoric it is, some people's bodies must not like that triazolam is only 50% orally BA, i've seen people rag about it which surprised me greatly. I'll most likely never know, triazolam has been removed from all provinces but one, Ontario. Apo stopped producing APO-Triazo and there's nothing else but simply "Triazolam 0.25mg" now, I notice that the 0.125mg are gone. Sorry about the off topic last part, I'm just sad that it's the only benzo thats in Canada i'll never have a chance to try, I got a feeling A&A Pharms won't make any more once the remaining stock of 0.25mg pills are gone.


I never bothered buying pyrazolam or diclazepam for that matter because I'm rx'd valium everyday and xanax prn so I only got interested when flubromazepam appeared and now all the other triazolos so my observations are purely investigative.

Pyrazolam.. for me this past week has been a life saver..

I suffer with anxiety and have tried a whole list of medications (Mainly SSRI and SRNI) and none have done anything. I'm now on 450mg per day of Pregabalin (which I recommend VERY highly), so this may mean that the Pyrazolam is more potent when I take it? I had tried them earlier in the year but I dont like to do benzo's to often. 


So I ordered 20 x 0.5mg.. I miss a lot of uni because of my anxiety and I was feeling particularly anxious on this day but I had to go in for group work! So Right after my 150mg capsule of Pregabalin, I took one 0.5mg Pyrazolam.. I felt no sedation, but in 30 minutes my anxiety was GONE.. and I mean GONE GONE! I was able to talk to members in my group and came out of my shell. No worries, no awful thoughts, I was productive and felt comfortable (I haven't felt comfortable in a work/uni environment for.. well as long as I can remember!).


My question is can I take these once or twice a week will this cause any dependence problems? I know there is a risk I might start taking them everyday because I felt so.. well to be honest, I felt normal, how I should feel in my day to day life.  So say I took 1-2 0.5mg pills , once or twice per week (when I cant handle my anxiety), I wouldnt get withdrawals if I did stop? From what i've read it takes few weeks of daily use of benzo's? But I will only be using for an as needed basis?

It lacks effects? News to me, I find it the *only* recreational benzo, and it is light on producing amnesia. Doubly positive.

I've tried 2mg for breakfast and I feel quite spaced out after 60 minutes, Anxiety has gone. I could easily use these for a night on my own watching TV with a few steady drinks I reckon, but maybe not 2mg.

Has anyone experiences with high doses over 5mg? It feels really nice if I use 2-4mg over the day, I imagine a combination of Tetrazepam and Alprazolam to feel similar, nice muscle relaxation without beeing too sleepy or sedated. Does anyone know the "danger zone" from more or less strong triazolo-benzos like Triazolam, Brotizolam or Alprazolam? I would love to experience high doses of this but have a feeling that those triazolo-benzos are somehow more dangerous than most others, or is that completely wrong and 5x the amount of for example Alprazolam ist of similar toxicity as 5x the equivalent dosage Diazepam (or similar) for example?


Btw, for everyone using this for Anxiolysis: Even doses of 250mcg/0,25mg have subtle mind-relaxing effects, I have no anxiety problems but had really much stress the last month´s, I even developed hyperthyroid symptoms for about 2-3 weeks and had a lump in the throat from much anger, shouting, insomnia coused by short-acting cannabinoids, loss of a beloved pet etc., and the first dose of 250mcg brought my mind away from that constant "stress-trip" that felt like the opposite of GABA, like a light GABA-withdrawal or partly the effects of muira puama (gaba antagonist). 

It calmed me down but with no side-effects like sedation or muscle-relaxation wich only comes at higher doses but can be felt from 1mg up. The half-life is also perfect, 6 hours and no metabolites, so theres no hangover as it wears off over night with no "incomplete feeling" that long-acting benzos can couse when you´re coming down the next day which can lead to unnecessary (how do english people learn those words? Isn´t it impossible to hear if theres an "c" or "s" ?!) redosing.


This drug has imho much more potential as an effective anti-anxiety and anti-stress medicine than for example Alprazolam or Lorazepam with much less abuse-potential than other Benzos or Z-Drugs as you would need doses of 2-3mg or more to get really "high" which would mean you had to take almost 10 0,5mg tablets which wouldn´t be cheap compared with other Benzos like Alprazolam.


oh and is it normal to have the urge to write and talk when taking benzos? I often get really creative and talkfull like right now on pyraz, especially with etizolam, is that a usual benzo effect or is it more like I´m most of the time so stressed that only with benzos I feel so free and loose that I can relax and think about creative projects etc.? Many friends tell me they only get sedated and a bit drunk? I guess you have to have some kind of stress or anxiety to feel that euphoria, but I can´t remember that I ever felt so free with a calm but thoughtful mind even when I hadn´t those stressful times. It feels a bit like those first days from holidays when you can "feel the blue sky" and everything that bothered you falling away.

It's even better than it's close relative Alprazolam, even though it's nothing for recreational use (but i've never found any Benzo recreational and too dangerous for this).

There seems to be no straight line between recreational and medicinal, for example if I had weeks or month´s full of stress and take some Benzos in "mind- and muscle-relaxing" doses on a weekend evening like other people would drink a beer and avoid physical and psychological diseases coused by stress while enjoying the effects at the same time - is it recreational or medicinal?


edit: Pyrazolam at doses of 250mcg (or even a bit less, 0,25ml of a 0,5mg/ml Propyleneglycol solution has subtle effects, maybe the PG´s effects on absorption and blood brain barrier have to do something with this) up to to 2mg are useful for stress with less "spacy" feeling that Alprazolam can produce and doses from 2-5mg are muscle relaxing without much sedation.

Got around to Clonazolam, agree with you it is potent stuff. Etizolam is still King for general useage though, I really wouldn't take Clonazolam on a daily basis, mentally that feel would be very addicitive.

Yesterday I ate 1mg (2 yellow pellets) with a medium benzodiazepine tolerance.


I must say this benzo is quite hard hitting (quick comeup ~ 25min). Really anxiolytic, pretty much no sedation. Very chilled feeling to it and long lasting! I can still feel it a bit today, feel carefree and relaxed.


This one is great for anxiety issue and it last a while ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I loved Etizolam for awhile but it came to a point where it just makes me nod off to sleep, even when I'm wide away. So I pulled out Pyrazolam and.. wow. Maybe it's not so much the difference in benzos (that's certainly important) but that one should change up benzos to account for conditioning and changes in brain chemistry (tolerance.)


I posted about Pyrazolam here: [http://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads/764427-Wow-never-gave-Pyrazolam-a-chance?p=13158397#post13158397](https://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads/764427-Wow-never-gave-Pyrazolam-a-chance?p=13158397#post13158397)

@itsonlyme123: I wouldn´t count on that for everyone, I also thought Clonazolam (and Flubromazolam) had to be great benzos and ordered more than I actually needed to have something for my friends but everyone disliked it, either they said they didn´t get much effects or that it just wasn´t euphoric at all. They all prefered combinations of weaker benzos (Diclazepam, Flubroamzepam) over the ´zolams.


Personally I never came across any Benzo as euphoric as Etizolam, please can´t anyone make a slight change to Etizolam that doesn´t kill it´s euphoria? I would like to think you could do something on the halogen, but it seems if Phenazepam and Flubromazepam have worlds between them this could also be the case with Eti.

Having only recently discovered this, I have to say this is up there with my favourite benzos, pharma and RC. It is largely anxiolytic, and very potent in this regard, which suits my purposes (I don't have much trouble sleeping), it doesn't feel too compulsive or at least I can put it down relatively easily for long enough to avoid any dependency/addiction, in reasonably large doses I also find it quite euphoric, but perhaps that is due to my personal circumstances. I take around 2 - 2.5mg in a go for decent effects (for me) and these last long enough but not too long. Pharmacologically speaking, it is also interesting as it is apparently not metabolised and leaves the body as the same compound it went in as. In addition to limiting the strain it has on your liver, this also means that there are no lingering metabolites that can increase the risk of physical dependency if done too often. 


I think if you up the dose to very high, it can begin to become more sedating too. It is available very very cheaply in the UK at the moment as well, hence the additional attraction.

No love for any RC benzo's, but I do like Pyrazolam a lot. It's got a lovely subtlety to it that melts away your anxiety but doesn't leave you feeling like shit

With my limited experience with pyro. It has more potential than other benzos on the market imo unless you just want to get fucked up. Not only relieave anxiety i found this more recreational than others tbh. And i've tried alot, etiz, clonazolam/epam, diclaz, diaz, alprazolam, flubromazepam, etc Although i think flubromazepam has the best potential here, pyro is very underrated. Currently waiting on 50 1mg pills ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) Better get here..


^To the above poster, couldn't agree more.

Big up these.  I had 0.5mg today in a live, important situation - I felt like 'me' but just with the anxious thoughts gone and natural enough to pass as normal.  I don't know why people need to do more. I did find this dose slowed down my thinking just *slightly* at some points, so wouldn't want to have pushed it further.


Will definitely be stocking up.  Anyone know what the shelf-life for these is?

Pyrazolam can be insufflated. You could take even less, 0.25 say if you enjoy it for these very real purposes. Although I'd suggest Inderal 10mg (not the larger doses for actual cardiac issues) for situational/pre-performance anxiety, it controls the physical response to anxiety that starts the gears of the vicious cycle that is anxiety + medication. I wish all doctors tried Inderal 10mg before benzos.

I tried this out yesterday, I think it is pretty good. I had 1mg in total in the evening and felt super relaxed and had a good long sleep for a change. The effects have pretty much worn off by this morning. Previously I have been using diclazepam, but got sick of it because it lasts so long and I would still be feeling the effects for over a day.

So I acquired some 0.5mg for a current bout of general & social panic disorder due. As doctors in the UK tend to give antidepressants I thought I would give these a go in the interim while waiting of Mirtazapine to start working its magic. I have tried .5mg day one, very little but some anti anxiety effects. Day 2 1.5mg at 9am, met a friend for coffee at 12, still some little anxiety but managed to get through it. Both doses were oral and gave me a jelly leg feeling and little sedation. Had a doctors appointment at 6 so at 5 I broke a 0.5 in half and crushed and sniffed 0.25. It BURNED for a few minutes but then WOW. No anxiety whatsoever and no jelly legs, relaxed but not sedated. Managed to flirt and have banter with the receptionist at the doctors & thanked her for her efficiency (not like me at all). Up the nose felt alot clearer and more anti anxiety inducing then oral, anyone else found this?

**(y)**


Okay so after some further research I just thought I would give my opinion. For general / social anxiety disorder this stuff is unbelievable. 1.5mg is the sweet spot for me. I finally feel like a human being enjoying life again. That is, I feel as a normal person should feel. This is euphoric for me, but only in the sense it allows me to be myself, which is euphoric when its been such a long time of pure panic whenever being in a situation which doesn't just include me and myself. I have no fears whatsoever. I 1.5mg with a 0.5mg after about 6-7 hours is enough for the whole day, taken only on days I have to go to class or work, so 3 days a week I don't need this stuff. But when I do have it I feel so confident its unbelievable. I have never taken any benzo for recreation so I don't know if it would be recreational for someone who seeks it. I certainly feel different, but only in mind and not in body. This is a hugely therapeutic drug, used responsibly it will help if you have anxiety issues. I can get through work and class on this stuff with people not noticing, well they do notice that I am more inclined to ask questions and challenge ideas in class, but no drunk like state I got from Etizolam when I tried that about a year ago. Finally, up the nose had no real benefits, I just had to find the correct oral dose which I think I have now done.

Sounds like it would be really helpful to me but Im terrified of the possibility of withdrawal. 


I have never had an urge to take benzoes alot- not of the diazepam I bought a gram of once or the etizolam I tried a couple of times but I would always have a  fear in my mind of it becoming a habit. but certainly there was never any urge to take more.


I wonder if this has less addiction potential if taken just once/twice a week? I mean it has a short half life comparatively to other benzoes doesnt it with no metabolites. So as long as it isnt in your system then you wont get withdrawals if you leave a few days in between is that correct? Or does it still wear down your receptors or something?


Seems it could have huge therapeutic potential to me. I have never wanted to go on anti depressants 24/7 which seems to be the cure all for doctors here in the uk as you mention. If you just sneeze once they want to put you on a non stop regimen of anti deprresants for AT LEAST 6 months!


So has anyone here had some experience taking them over a long ish range of time ie a few month-1 year without experiencing problems? I mean on and off not constant dosing. 


Taking benzoes must be possible in this respect because my dad was prescribed diazepam for panics he would get when going to the city centre and he would just take them now and then and he stopped taking them a while ago and he didnt mention anything about any problems.


But Im just so terrified of even the possibility of physical addiction.

I would say the addiction potential is mostly influenced by the individual user, for example I had taken Etizolam daily for almost 3 or 4 month´s and then just gradually reduced it to 0. I use benzos since almost 10 years on and off. I always tried to keep enough space between doses and had the half life in the back mind so it wouldn´t accumulate. Also I never take them regularly, for example one day 1mg, the next 0,5mg, one day without any, then 2 days with 2mg, then 0,5mg and after some weeks at least 1-4 weeks without any, etc. so my system wouldn´t try to adapt the receptors to an specific amount of stimulation. 

The worst addiction problems I have are Nicotine, Cannabis and synthetic Cannabinoids because I used them for years constantly all day without any great changes in dosage and no day´s off so a heavy physical dependency evolved.


If one has the willpower to take a day or week off and not take something so regulary that it becomes routine there is very little chance to get addicted. I tread Benzos similar to Opioids and Alcohol and never had withdrawal problems.

Pyrazolam is great for anxiety and not as moreish as other euphoric benzos. Not having anxiety is my personal euphoria, not like ecstasy euphoria but Ive battled benzos since I was 13 I'm 21 now and it still affects me. Pyrazolam is best for me for this reason. I was a fiend to benzos,  needing 80mg valium daily not to have a panic attack and enevatably fits. My preferred dose when I was 15/16 was 150mg In a day if I could, it consumed me I've gone up to 400mg before and still been able to function. Took over 3 years to get down to my current dose of 0.5mg and my life is still just panic. Pyrazolam is the best of all RCs! (I should mention I know it was stupid but benzos were my crutch after events in my childhood)

No But I have IV'd it and it is effective. With a good filter it will leave behind what seems to me 100 percent of the binding which is a yellow sludge and fills the syringe up with a clear liquid. 1mg IV provides a nice relaxed anxiolytic feeling. No rush or anything and it it took a few minutes to realize it was working.

Hand alcohol, Alcogel or what u call it in english will remove the yellow in seconds, I take a paper and sum alcogel on it and roll the pill in it and there it is a lovely white pill, then I crush it and snort it. Works wonders of any other pills with a layer on them.

Okay so I have been taking Pyrazolam for two months, 3mg in the morning and maybe another 0.5 at around 5pm for anxiety. I have gone a couple of days without in between and had no withdrawals. 


In the interest of harm reduction I feel compelled to let people who read this thread to let people know of a recent stint in A&E. Now I am no way saying the Pyrazolam and my health problems are related, but I think it is worth noting as there could be a link, which unless people post nobody could see if there is a relationship between Pyrazolam and what happened to me.


I had been suffering shortness of breath for a couple of weeks. It was only when a friend was on the phone to me and I was walking to the shop which is about 3 minutes down the road that she said "what are you doing, your not having sex while on the phone are you" that I realised how breathless I had been getting. I put this down to smoking too much I had been smoking alot recently with being in my final year of University and finding it quite stressful. Anyway things came to ahead about a week later when I woke up with a really bad pain on my right side under my ribcage. This was mainly in the middle of the night when I had been lay on that side. Within a couple of days I was in constant pain (really bad pain, especially when taking a breath) and was getting breathless while showering. I went to work at the weekend and everyone said I needed to see a doctor or ring 111 for advise due to getting breathless just when talking. Anyway went to the doctors on the Monday and she checked me over listened to my lungs and took my BP and heart rate and sent me up to A&E. After a CAT scan it showed up that I had pulmonary embolisms on both lungs and lung infracts on both lungs too. Basically blood clots on the arteries in my lungs and part of each lung had seeped blood due to the pressure behind the clots and therefore damaged the tissue. 


Now I am okay, after a week and half of treatments and on anticoagulants and Dihydrocodine for the pain I am finally feeling better and can breath better again (though the coughing up blood is unpleasant). They have told me that these clots were formed in the lungs and not as an effect of DVT, but they cant do further tests for 6 months once I am off the anticoagulants.


Like I said, I am not saying the Pyrazolam has caused this, I am a smoker (or was until this). However I thought it was worth noting as even the doctors thought I had researched my symptoms online and was just emphasising pulmonary embolism symptoms because they were so shocked I had this at the age of 27 with no/low risk factors for it. After the CAT scan her words to me was "I have come to eat a piece of humble pie, would you like to know what you have wrong". I think it's worth mentioning as I take no other RCs and although unlikely, Pyrazolam could have played a part.

Pyrazolam is incredibly functional yet highly potent anxiolytic. Don't underrate it, just don't expect sedation. Expect to feel very relaxed. The stuff I get from the UK is always excellent quality. Also found it useful to taper off other benzos. However, it'd definitely moreish.

Got pyrazolam and was pleasantly surprised. It didn't cause sedation for me, which was good. I take 2mg Xanax for sleep at night. I do not ever take the Xanax during the day, even tho my anxiety is pretty bad. Sometimes I have a hard time doing small things like going to the grocery store if I see it is crowded. 


But got the pyrazolam, took one (it was a light blue round pill, very similar looking to Etilaam, but dissolved differently under tongue. I could feel the pyrazolam within 15-20 minutes. Was able to get my daily stuff done, with little to no anxiety. Which is great for me! So far I like pyrazolam. It helped with my anxiety without making me dysfunctional. I didn't noticed any loss of coordination or anything. Felt productive on it. 

I only plan on taking as when needed for anxiety

Yellow tablets (0.5) contain sodium lauryl sulfate. This is used mainly in detergents and cosmetics (shampoos, ...) and can cause mouth ulcers and skin irritation. This substance is not allowed (in Europe) for food use, so i wonder what effects it can cause on the stomach and intestines ?

Sodium Laruel Suflate is a common excipient for orally dosed tablets and the EU considers it to have GRAS status (generally recognised as safe). See [this review](http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Report/2015/08/WC500191475.pdf) by the European Medicines Agency.


> There is currently no EU regulatory guideline or recommendations in place relating to the acceptable levels of sodium laurilsulfate (SLS) in medicinal products. The vast majority of SLS use is in oral products (tablets and capsules) where it rarely displays any adverse reactions. It is not recommended for the injectable or ophthalmic routes.

> ...
> 
> SLS is a Generally Regarded as Safe (GRAS) excipient and is included in the FDA Inactive Ingredients Database (dental preparations; oral capsules, suspensions, and tablets; topical and vaginal preparations). In the EU, SLS is included in non-parenteral medicines.

Thank you for the document. However, I read this and...it's not very clear :


> There is currently no EU regulatory guideline or recommendations in place relating to the acceptable levels of sodium laurilsulfate (SLS) in medicinal products. The scope of this safety assessment is limited to medicinal products applied to the skin or the scalp, such as creams, ointments, gels and shampoos, which contain SLS...

> 
> 
> ..This review will not cover its use as an excipient for other dosage forms or routes of administration (e.g. tablets and capsules, liquids for oral administration or toothpastes), or where SLS is used as active ingredient (e.g. laxative enema preparations).

And this is not very reassuring:


> SLS is a moderately toxic material with acute toxic effects including irritation to the skin, eyes, mucous membranes, upper respiratory tract and stomach.

I had also read that the substance was used as an insecticide:

I'm starting to think the above posters are confusing sodium laurel sulfate (a food additive) with Sodium laureth sulfate (an irritant).

To be clear, the EU regulatory document I linked to above is about sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), not sodium laureth sulfate (SLES).

Well, I had to take just 10 in an extra gift after getting my last supply ( I can get many benzos in continental europe and some of the UK stores moving are going to move and add in a few things some of us have been waiting for and I said well "well why the hell not Pyrazolam 0.5mg".


So today when I woke up I didn't take my supposed to be taken with breakfast 10mg valium and 6mg bromazepam and just had 1.5mg of pyrazolam, being told it is shit since so long. I got knocked out. Maybe not having worries shuts me down, but I didn't work (I work by contract at home so it's not a tragedy, just gonna have to double down tomorrow) until 3 pm when I woke up. The hell? I though it was something like clorazepate (and just at the 15mg dose, the 7.50 and 3.25 I never even saw (they're weird lookin' pills, 15mg is a gelcap) which was like this is hyper functional anti-anxiety medication (clorazepate does nothing itself, turns into nordazepam through the liver).


So, what's up with this, could it boost back the clonazolam I took for bed 10 hours before (0.75mg)? Well, I'll try just one for the next time my band gets together, they know I got the talent, I just spent 5 years or so with a guitar amp and all I could do was use this jack and plug it into the mic entry of my sound card and use a program called FXBOX which is an amp emulator with many preset sounds and it also lets you play with it like a real amp, with a good desktop sound system, it' alright, but its too much to carry to practice, thankfully it allowed me to record everything good I came up with in some jams I did by myself where I literally invented songs on the spot, when I got into ''the Zone" ya know, thanks to fxbox i got 400 mp3 files of sessions, there was a positive to having to sell my 100 watt peavy transtube technology amp for half price I got it just to get a shtload of Dilaudid 4mg (Purdues). Anyway, I've played in front of crowds of 200 people between 2000-2003 and right now I'm not comfortable compared to the other guitarist in the band who really shreds, I want to write some riffs or I'm out, I can do without writing solos, My burly fingers were never meant for them. Maybe it can be used in a utilitarian way, but 4mg is a lot. They are yellow pills which have lemony taste with a score.

Then you have love for one. As for those who all jerk around about how great Etizolam is. It is largely euphoric, like  very very euphoric, like xanax and flam can be, especially in blotter form and like taking 4mg at once. But after that I feel maybe 45 minutes of anxiolysis equal to 5mg valium and then it's gone. I'll get some Etizest from an european vendor (even the powder I can get in Canada does the same thing), maybe the actual pharmaceutical used in Italy (they have Etizest brand in Italy, right?) before I discard it. Clonazolam in moderate amounts >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Etizolam for me, it lasts long, it makes you act normally, more social, it makes me leave my room and call people. I'm speaking of taking 0.5-0.75mg-1mg in the morning, having shots of soft liquor in the afternoon (like Amarula 17,8%, just 2), and then all my social anxiety goes away and I don't need to take clonazolam again until bed time (and I'll have my Rx'd valium usually instead for sleep). Since I got a 250 0.5 blotter sheet, I've seen friends I've ignored or who have "ignored me" (their job requires them to leave town and go far up north the province, it's where all the job is, well there's Montreal too but mostly for construction, and my friend who has all his diplomas in things related to construction even was accepted to University with a regular degree in "General Construction" never wants to endure the hell that is summer in Montreal all the humidity of that bubble, which he says gets worse when you are up there 150 feet in the air...ugh, with my fear of heights that would be impossible for me Anyway, I'm the only one with the stay-at-home job and for a while it was only part time because of that fucking Sarcoidosis which is finally gone, took 11 years of my life that bitch, and yes it was proven through the few tests that can prove it after they tried to say it was worsening of my small asthma to emphysema, it was none of that. But they caught it in the 3/4 of the time, we suddenly become disease-free in about 10-15 years. 


Anyway, that's not a thread about me, sorry about that. But I should have put some attentionto pyrazolam, maybe just as another main benzo booster. And I think there was 2mg pellets of that stuff originally...oh well, I know I'll be able to continue buying some if I want some even with Cameron's mind boggling law. I guess the British have to suffer the same way Canadians sufferd under Harper, who strangely didn't give a shit about drugs, only the ex prime minister of Ontario caused the whole Oxycontion Scare and removal from the market (while Oxy IR 20's were still around), I bet she had Purdue lobbyists or something cos they knew the patent for Oxycontin was soon to be over, and it was, a couple months after OxyNeos showed up, 6 companies started to make generic oxycontin like the old ones lol. But I'm thinking Cameron is even more insane than Harper. Harper was only a loud mouth about Russia,spoke up at the slightest attempt by Russia to give Ukraine a better deal than the EU,and that whole USAID, NED, CIA thing failed and Russia just took back some of its original territory. He only did it for electoral reasons, Canada having the largest Ukrainian diaspora, although none of em speak Ukrainian and haven't since 100 years...Gretzky used to say his grandfather was Russian, but now he says he was Ukrainian...blah blah blah stop me please 8)

Hello i was thinking of buying 250mg of Pyrazolam powder and wondered about the ratio with mixing it in water to try and allow me to somehow stick to to my usual 0.5mg does to get me up and about in the morning. Cant seem to find too much about it on this site nor internet. Anyone any ideas of the best way of achieving my goals. Thanks

I don't think it soluble in water, PG would be better. If you want a 0.5 mg / 1 ml solution you need 250 mg Pyrazolam + 500 ml PG

Hey has anybody ever seen pyrazolam or phenazepam in powder form? 

I ordered some stuff from Chinese vendor and they always have a habit of labeling there products with the first letter in my case a "p" it's a mustard yellow powder insoluble in water but will dissolve in PG or VG with quite a bit of heat and stirring

 I'm not asking for an identification and I'm just asking for if anybody has ever seen Pure pyrazolam powder

with this being water soluble, anyone tried shooting it? any good?


are there any other water soluable rc benzos? someone told me norflurazepam/n-desalkylflurazepam might be, but it's not. which is too bad, because that's a good one with a really heavy feel like midazolam.

never seen pyrazolam powder, but i've seen batches of both clonazolam and bromazolam that were orange with poor solubility even in pg. both were spectrometer tested, so i know they were clonazolam and bromazolam.

super confusing when you quote and cutout the handle that your're quoting. still appreciate your replies because you're smart and knowledgeable.


you can shoot benzos by adding pg. i hear thats not good for you. was wondering if there are some you don't need pg for.


is .9 percent sodium chloride solution for inhalation acidic enough (.9 percent sodium chloride solution for injection costs about as much as pure cocaine in denver)? or if by medium you mean the substance, is pyrazolam acidic enough?

While we're on the topic of solubility, would pyrazolam be soluble in ethanol (95% everclear) and if so, how many mg/ml do you think? Got my tolerance down and thinking of trying this stuff out soon and everclear is my go-to for etizolam solutions at 5mg/ml. I know others use PG but I'd prefer to avoid that if possible.

It means that it's only marginally soluble in water without the aid of an acid, I'd stick with things like ascorbic acid if you want to inject it, seems pretty harmless. Sodium chloride has no appreciable effect on ph values btw.

I just solved 1 g Etizolalm in 1 litre PG - It was no problem. I always make the PG hot in a water bath before I put my substance in it, and I always put 1/4 PG out of the bottle before i put the substance in it so that i can rinse what's got stuck in the funnel so that I really have my 1mg/1ml solution. Works perfectly for me and lasts not long until you have a homogenic solution. Of course, in between take it out of the water and shake it like hell, then do a hot wather bath again. I guess I did it three times in a row and everything was fine.


JJ


EDIT: Oh I'm very sorry, we are at the Pyrazolam, not the Etizolam-Thread. Until my amazon-ordered PG arrives I'll make a Pyrazolam-solution 1mg/1ml and will tell you how it went.

Yes, I have Pyrazolam in powderform and made a 1mg/1ml solution out of one gram. I just did 4 mg ( have to admit I have an extremely high benzo tolerance). Since Im not feeling too much I'll d o a bit more now and let you know then...

Ok, it solves, but in a way I have never seen: 


the brown glass bottle looks like there is fog inside, and it still got better but there are still big pieces of the substance to that i think i unfortunately have to filter the Pagoclone again. Ugh.

Hi there,


an update to the Pyrazolam: WOW. I mean I was up the whole night doing loads of benzos and cocaine, so I immediately tried 8 mg Pyrazolam because mytolerance is so fucking high, I never expected it to knock me out for a few hours. And from all I have read people were not even satisfied with it because they complained its not strong enough...


Perhaps it's the bars they are sold and they are much underdosed? I never ever took any bar of anything, i always prepare a solution, hopefully a homogenic one, and normally always with PG, f ew times with Vodka. In PG everything solves quickly normally. But for the Pagoclone its perhaps not the right solubent, I dont know.....


buuuuut : I love Pyrazolam now. I'm in love.

Got my tolerance down and thinking of trying this stuff out soon and everclear is my go-to for etizolam solutions at 5mg/ml. I know others use PG but I'd prefer to avoid that if possible.

Hi,


why do you avoid PG? That's the only soluble that is not harmful for the body as far as I know (correct me if Im wrong). I made a litre of Pyrazolam yesterday and today I already have a homogenic solution. I gave it a few hot water baths, shaked it a lot and repeated this a few times and 24 hours later it dissolved completely.


JJ


EDIT: I made a 1mg/1ml solution.

Because I don’t want a 1mg/ml solution, I want higher concentrations. I’ve also read that PG can mess with your gut, which is the entire reason I use BZDs (medicinally for pain).


Also it seems like people have a hard time getting Etizolam to dissolve in PG and have to heat it; with 95% ethanol Etizolam completely dissolves in a matter of minutes at high concentrations, so the amount of ethanol I consume ends up being only .2-.4ml at a time (or zero ml if I let it evaporate on something first) which isn’t much at all. It seems like PG is much worse for dissolving Etizolam yet everyone uses it, and I don’t understand why. I don’t want to heat my drugs.

I'm considering getting a small order of Pyrazolam.  I've been searching for a benzo I can take while enrolled in classes that won't hinder my ability to retain information and focus. From what I gathered thus far it seems to be uniquely clear headed in its effects. Obviously any benzo will interfere with memory to some degree, but as far as Pyrazolam goes how intense are its amnesic properties? Also, have others had any trouble with rebound anxiety from Pyrazolam? Many of these RC benzos tend to leave me in severely hypersensitive state following moderate use, so it'd be nice if this one were more forgiving in that regard.

Heavily benzo dependent and has been through the gamete of both prescribed and non.


recently tried norfluraz. as a taper and was very disappointed   with 4mg pyraz plus .25 kpin I'm fine all day    Pyraz seems to be excellent at creating anxiolysis without "bartarding you"


I'd be interested in some other experiences since this is my first

I'm feeling as if it IS a bit less "drunky" than other RCs, even my prescribe pins.


I took a relatively large dose (4mg) and I feel  baseline (anxiouslessness) but without intoxication

For me still it's a very mild benzo. I compare it to the Z-Benzoes, Zopiclone or Zolpidem. So - meanwhile it's not my favourite one anymore, because I like the very sedating, hypnotic ones more.

Pyrazolam is strongly sedating at high dose. And that sedation is felt next day due to long duration of action.


My batch is tan so maybe it's a bad batch. It can upset my stomach (could have been a coincidence) and when I tried to vape it I got a terrible and near instant headache.

I didn't find it's duration very long and what do you consider a high dose? I haven't gone over 3-4mg, so maybe I need to increase my intake. How potent do others find Pyrazolam? I acquired this batch from an unfamiliar source, so I'm not too sure about it's quality. 1mg of pyraz feels like .5mg of alprazolam.

Yeah that is about right as far as potency from my experience. Is your batch a tan/brown color? 


I find that pyrazolam is ok at lower doses (1-2mg) as its both effective for anxiety and both barely and simultaneously clearly perceptible. At high doses (5mg+) I find it sedating, amnestic and sort of depressing, producing a certain sadness that is rather uncomfortable.  Other benzo make me sort of sad, but pyrazolam takes the cake (again, only at high doses).


Benzos, while incredibly effective, are poisonous. Its like paying for anxiety relief with a credit card with an interest rate you can't afford; the rebound is 100x than the original anxiety. 


Ultimately who knows what the fuck I actually have, though I think with high probability it actually is pyrazolam. Not a fan but it's functional at 1-2mg.

So, my prefered RC vendor sells Pyrazolam in 3 mg pellets. That sounds like a huge dose to me, but reports on the needed dose in this thread were all over the place. What is the current consensus? I'm looking for functional anxiety relief.

has someone already found the max solubility of Pyrazolam in PG? i made a solution 10mg/ml and it has a yellow tint instead of being clear does this mean its not fully dissolved yet? Am using a wax warmer as a cheap multipurpose hot plate idk the temp but probs around 160 its in a clear glass bottle i have heated and shaken for around 30 min is this just one that isnt as soluble in pg and takes awhile or is the solution over saturated?

Same here 3mg's. If they are dosed as said you never know. A whole one was perfectly functional. But I do have a tolerance. 


Back then, UK day's, the pellet's were 0.5 mg. Same effect's purely functional. Back then i had no tolerance. so that would be about right. Start slow and work your way up and you ll  find out what this Benzo exactly does. I still don't know.

IIRC then pyrazolam is soluble in water! You could make a good solution with watered down vodka if you're taking it orally or rectally.


Pyrazolam works great plugged and sublingually at doses of 1-2mg depending on tolerance of course. I think the most I ever took was 4 or 5mg and this was really strong.

It's not a sedating benzo, the least sedating I've ever had in fact. Feels really mentally clear and it destroys anxiety so well!!


I'm utterly astonished that this benzo wasn't picked up and marketed really. I honestly think it's the best benzo for anxiety going because it doesn't fuck you up and has RELATIVELY low abuse potential compared to Xanax and diazepam. Really underrated 'zo.

I think I've head pyrazolam referred to as "Xanax Lite" and this is a very apt description. Unless I've made that up, but regardless it reminds me of alplrazolam but less dangerous.

Alprazolam has an obvious sedating feel which Pyrazolam hasn't. Ime.


For me they are worlds apart. Sedative/ hypnotic/ strong anxiolytic vs slight anxiolityc.

I suppose. They are very different in their hypnotic effects, but I really do think pyrazolam is a great for anxiety and one of the least abusable benzos due  to the lack of sedation.

I'd have thought it would be a pharmaceutical companies wet dream...

Clobazam is not even noticeable in normal dosage (20 mg), like Pyrazolam (3 mg) . So in that regard they are a bit alike. But Clobazam is, on paper. a very effective med for Epilepsy. 


No idea what the receptor affinity's of Pyrazolam are,.

My Midazolam nosespray, the better one. Was based upon MaltoDextrine. No idea how this aids the absorption trough the nose. There were no acid's in there, just that and Saline water.


But the other one's I had were based upon BenzylAlcohol. And that ones stung like a Bee and clogged my nose up.

It works pretty well for that, not sloppy and disinhibited like etizolam or alprazolam. However if the dose is high enough it does eventually get sloppy.


Like all benzos it can leave you feeling sort of empty and depressed however.

A chiral methyl @ 3 (I think it's (S) doubles alcohool-like activity and reduces onset and reduces douration and reduces potency by 2 needed (0 mg)

Pyeyzolam, mynazolam and pyeyzoolam wierw fist generation.


3-methyl of like above dobles potency and halves duration more like souble potency


3-methyl pynazolam is so safe 2.5mg dose and is a fast-acting antidepressant. Take one and in 15 minutes all depession is gone.

Adding a 2'F increases potency by x10 (and with (S) 3 mthyl x20 i.e. 2mg.

2 milligram for each of the alcool mimics snd the latter has a plateau effect so it's safer.


Cost is £20000.g i.e. £2 a drink.

AA clockwork orange style milk var open 24/6 wouldv be cood.

Ok had my first try with pyrazolam today.  I have almost virgin tolerance to benzos so the amounts I post about are probably far less than others.  Put it this way, I am glad I started with 1 mgs.  (yeah I knew the 4-6 mgs suggestion was too much for me when I read that)   It hit quick.  Felt calm as if in a dream.  If I layed down I would doze.   Seems somewhat stronger than etizolam and for sure had an effect as where sometimes with a same dose of etizolam I don't feel much but if I lay down will be snoozing.  Did not get any depression written about and honestly most benzos taken during the day make me feel flat and apathetic.  So they all do that to me.  I had planned on a few naps today though and got some in ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


Loosens inhibitions the same as xanax and etizolam for me  I can't speak on duration yet.  Does not seem as lingering as long as bromazolam and fades like etizolam. Just had some kratom and another 1 mgs more pre dinner just now  The goal is to go in and out of sleep on the couch tonight  You know, escape from this BS stressful day.  But as far as only good for anxiety and not as sleepy, well that is probably more for people that use a lot of benzos.  I may not be able to tell the different between xanax, ativan or pyrazolam.  I know that some people can and have learned the subtle differences


On a side note as I research I read a lot of posts.  And when etizolam was readily available a lot of people seemed to think it was weak, getting up to 10 + mgs a day where even that stopped working.  Seemed to get some hate when it was around called overrated a lot.  NOW, when we can't get it anymore the whole "pre ban" etizolam folk lore is out in full force as the greatest thing. lol  I for sure think nostalgia factors in when we look at our past and drugs we can't get anymore.  But as we can't get it people put it up on a pedestal.  To me it was my favorite way to get a good nights sleep from a therapeutic dose.  Woke up refreshed.  The closest to that now is fluclotizolam.  And may very well be pyrazolam too, I will know after I go to sleep.


I like the lighter, short acting benzos and my hope is a whole slew of them will be developed and available.  I have no issues with this class of drugs.  In fact I am not sure I could even take them 3 days in a row  I need to clear my head.  So occasional use has worked for years for me when needed.

Yeah it sounds like the typical pyrazolam experience. It's not a benzo to know yourself to sleep with, definitely all about the anxiolitic effects rather than the drowies.

I have to say I took 1 mg at 12:00PM, then another 1 mg at 5:00PM with some kratom.  For me that was too much.  I do not remember the night.  And I did sleep.  If fact in and out of sleep.  I am so glad I did not take more.  So my advice for someone benzo naive like me is trying .5 pyrazolam to start.  I understand why some years back there were .5 mg pills.   Suggesting more than that should be taken with caution.  I know people that take a lot of benzos can do 2 + mgs of this.  To me I am sure that is way too much.  And very happy I did not do that.


I think sometimes buzz words get taken as fact.  The notion that pyrazolam is not recreational. No benzo is recreational for me.  I use them as utility drugs on occasion. But pyrazolam hit quick and I for sure felt it.  Just like any other benzo. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  But for people that can take a lot of benzos I can see how this does not make them as sleepy as bromazolam.  But it can for sure be used for that.


Anyhow I think it is a solid benzo.  I think I am going to read all of [@AlsoTapered](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/573863/) posts on the subject as there is a lot of info here.

I had one of these 0,5mg pellets that they sold years ago. Didn’t feel much because I also had 2mg diclazepam with it. Now last year I had a proper test with 2-3 of these 3mg pellets. Found it to be a rather lame benzo, much less good than simple diazepam. Guess the triazolo doesn’t go well with the pyridine ring…

It's definitely more of an anxiolitic. I'd say it could be marketed as "Xanax lite" as it doesn't clobber you as much as any other benzos I've had, except clobazam, strangely, even though it has "clob" in the name; clobazam was really mild and disappointed me. I do like my hypnotic benzos though,

Taking large doses can feel recreational in a way, but only if you find benzos recreational. It makes anxiety evaporate.

I would recommend anyone naïve to benzos start with 0.5-1mg as well. I'd say 1mg pyrazolam is about equipotent to 1mg alprazolam, it just isn't hypnotic. It used to make me feel a bit manic, as I'd feel so free if anxiety without sedation.

Beware those that like to take benzos sublingually, though. It is water soluble which is unusual for a benzo, but it's acidic as fuck, so burns/ulcers occur if you try and take the pellets sublingually.

I used to take them plugged. 3mg plugged with 300mg dihydrocodeine was a fucking special time I remember. Please note, this could be dangerous to repeat unless you have tolerance to both opiates and benzos.

I noticed with the solution of 2 mgs a ml that it is acidic and is bitter and burns.  I had to look that up here to see.  Etiz and bromaz don't have a taste for me.  Bromaz a little sweeter but mild.  Alpraz and diazepam are bitter.  But pyrazolam was pungent.  So I can see that.  It did taste like battery acid.

I found 20mg of clobazam and 1mg of pyrazolam to be a VERY potent anxiolytic. I guess that it's because the mixture of a 1,4-benzodiazepine (pyrazolam) and a 1,5-benzodiazepine (clobazam) means that the combination acts on many more GABA subunits. It still wasn't hypnotic but it I was too chilled out to even roll up a cig (not like me).


If people don't know, researchers have produced the triazolo derivatives of clobazam (and it's 7-nitro analogue). I can honestly see someone producing something like:


1-methyl-8-nitro-6-phenyl-4H-[1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-a][1,5]benzodiazepin-5(6H)-one


Which is about 20 times more potent as clobazam. The chemistry is a bit more involved but the 1 report I have suggest that 1mg was as potent as 10mg of diazepam. It was also said to be quite euphoric BUT one report does not really tell us much - expectation can be important.

Wait till you have taken Clobazam, when that was available. Even a whole pill you notice nothing like the general benzo's. But even less then Pyrazolam, I could feel a bit sleepy on that. Not Clobazam.

It's kind of interesting that clobazam has an activity ceiling. The maximum adult dose is 40mg/day which is supposed to produce anxiolytic (but not hypnotic) action equal to around 20mg/day of diazepam.


In fact in the 1970s researchers tried treating children who suffered from Lennox-Gastaut syndrome what was termed 'superthereputic' doses of clobazam. It was noted that their was no improvement in symptoms but their was also no increase in side-effects (sedation, hypersomnia, ataxia, amnesia and so on).


Now, nobody has identified WHY clobazam demonstrates a ceiling effect but it may simply be that at 40mg/day receptor occupancy approaches 100% and/or because clobazam is a low efficacy ligand. It's worth noting that from the late 1970s until the early 1980s an Italian team studied the QSAR of the 1,5-benzodiazepines and substitution of the 7-chloro with a 7-nitro doubled the activity of the drug in a similar manner to the same substitution in 1,4-benzodiazepines (i.e. diazepam --> nimetazepam). Further research showed that addition of a triazolo ring (e.g. nordiazepam --> alprazolam) increased potency but did not remove the activity ceiling.


Oh, and '2 substituents did NOT increase activity (unlike the 1,4-benzodiazepines eg. diazepam-->fludiazepam).


In short, it appears that it's possible to produce a 1,5-benzodiazepine which is as active as diazepam but thus far nobody has been able to find an example which does not have a ceiling in it's effects. That said, it it's possible to emulate the effects of 40mg of diazepam/day then I suggest that it still represents a reasonable target.


I should also mention that mixing clobazam with diazepam (for example) seems to produce pronounced sedation with potent anxiolytic effects. I'm presuming that this is because the 2 drugs combined have significant affinity for 12 different GABAa receptor subtypes. I admit I only got to try the mixture once but the subjective effects seemed far more than simply additive.

Over here it' s 80 mg/ day for adults. But due to shortages it not available.


But how comes all benzo's seem a bit alike, while this one is the oddball. Epeleptic's can get it as co-med. It was a godsend on some occassion's. But I never noticed anything resembling a benzo signature. But it did enable me to recoup sign's of upcoming insult's.

Wow, really? I've actually tried taking 900mg of clobazam at once and the side-effects were no greater than those delivered by 40mg/day. Sure, the duration of action was MUCH longer because even after days, their was still more than the ceiling dose in my body.


I have posted hotlinks to the papers that demonstrated the ceiling in a pretty robust manner. Maybe it's some specific condition (not identified in the 70s) that benefits from 80mg/day but that makes it a great drug - the side effects have a much lower ceiling than the activity... which is something I've only seen in PARTIAL agonists. So that's a useful insight for me, thank you [@emkee_reinvented](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/121874/) 


While studying the design of the alcohol mimic, we had several novel compounds called 'the supercats' (because our novel 1,4-benzodiazopines were named after our cats (Sniper = pyrazolam, Lettie = Pynazolam & Sally = pyeyzolam) so any intercepted E-mails wouldn't identify what was being discussed. I thought it silly, but Nutt insisted).

So top-left is our precursor (clobazam). There are name-reactions to concert the 7-Cl to a nitro (Friedel-Craft) or an ethynyl (Suzuki coupling) in 1-pot techniques, we didn't need a good yield or worry about side-reactions because preparative chromatography was used in all cases and if it cost $2000 to buy 500 grams of clobazam, it saved >$2000 in designing and optimizing a specific route.


Now nitrazam was certainly more sedating but of more interest was that it wasn't a potent seorotonin-releasing agent as pynazolam proved to be. Etylazam WAS alcohol-like. Importantly, it was able to mimic slight intoxication. The big problem wasn't that pyeyzolam wasn't good at simulating alcohol intoxication.. the problem that it was TOO good. If a person swallowed 20mg (as a 1mg/mL solution) their was barely an effect... but if that same person swallowed 30mg a week later (to ensure first dose has been entirely excreted) then they would be VERY 'drunk'. 


But then we did get interested in finding out if it were possible to produce a more active version of etylazam. So we produced the triazolo derivative of clobazam and it proved to be around x4 more potent - not the x10 exhibited in the 1,4-benzodiazepines. But subjectively the product was very similar to clobazam, a reduced duration of action due to it being excreted unchanged.


Now we did then swap the halide for an ethynyl to make pyeyzam. I never got to see the instrumental data on that one. I was just sent a 1.5L plastic bottle with the legend 'Super Sally - 1mg/ml + 3mL/mL' which proved to be a superb base for cocktails. A phone-call confirmed that it should simply be treated like any clear alcoholic spirit. 


Then we ran into the financial hurdles. We HAD a product that accurately simulated all of the positive effects (relaxation, increased happiness, reduction in anxiety, disinhibition and so on) of alcohol without any of the negative effects (mood lability, increased aggression, retrograde amnesia, anteriorgrade amnesia, nausea, ataxia, increased urination leading to dehydration, loss of judgement & so on). As far as alcohol's effects on the brain, (almost) all of the positive effects are mediated by the a5 subunit and (almost) all of the negative effects by the a1 subunit.


That's because pyeyzolam is a5b1y2 selective while pyeyzam is a5b2y2 and a5b3y2 selective - the mixture of two compounds produced a drug that was overall LESS selective but importantly, avoided a1 activity which seems to be a key element in physical dependence of alcohol developing as well as some of the negative effects alcohol causes.


But then we reached the position where, even when we provided our boss with the estimates for the cost of developing the mixture, it proved to be a difficult problem. Because the only legal way to introduce a mind-altering drug we knew of was to have it licenced as a medicine, any mixture would double the risks, double the costs and potentially double the time. Our aim was simply to get it accepted as a medicine to treat dependent alcohol users. We even found that Tipplersbane mushrooms contain a natural compound that is an aldehyde dehydrogenase inhibitor which we intended to add as in effect, it's action is like that of Antabuse (disulfiram). It felt like we had it and it would all become easier after three years of hard work.


After a few months were informed that financially, we HAD to find a single compounds that would substitute for the 2 candidates we had already found. That was a shock. The earlier stuff was all based on the research of others (who are cited in the patent) but this was something for which their was no known scaffold that would allow for a selectivity but had no beta selectivity.


We spent about 6 months researching all the papers that used the kavalactones and various other natural intoxicants first to find the subset whose effects were mediated by GABA activity and then we went through every paper and patent that dealt with anxiolytics, hypnotics and even anti-epileptics. We kept on expanding and expanding the search... it started to look like their was no evidence that such selectivity and activity was possible with a single candidate.

Checked it in '98 it was 40 mg max. In the newest edition 80 mg a day max, for Epeleptic's. Best benzo concerning side effect's totally unlike Clonazepam I think or any other benzo I know. 


To bad there is a shortage, and dr's see it as abuseable. they accused me of abusing them. A addiction dr. stopped the script my Neurologist didn't object. So back to RC's, Pyrazolam being one of em. 

Till I rediscovered Mulungu.

But thanks for Pyrazolam, AlsoTapered a gem. 

But in my possesion is now a bag of Mulungu which besides the being best sleepaid ime. Its also a better anti-convulsant then Diazepam.

I tried 80mg again... nope, no more sedating or anxiolytic than 40mg... it just meant I didn't need to take any more for two days. But as I said - it it's even more active at 80mg.day but produces no more 'side effects' then that is a great thing.

It's water solubility and basic nature are because in place of the usual (2-substituted) pendent benzene ring, it has a 2-pyridyl motif.


It would take a while to list all the reasons we chose that but solubility was one issue. It's not super-absorbent in water but their are alternatives to water for use in a nasal spray.

I actually had the chance to test out pyrazolam before a physical exam.  I always get nervous at doctors. So I have a lot of anxiety.  But just under 1 mg and it took away all that anxiety and I felt good.  That is about the best I can get out of benzos.  And a situation that I would use them.


I admit when I research these things here and reddit the comments are funny.  Ex.


"pyrazolam makes me feel so good, but it is not recreational"

"pyrazolam makes me feel the best out of any benzo but does not get me high"

"I just feel normal on pyrazolam"

"pyrazolam is crap"

"etizolam is crap...."

"pyrazolam gets me higher than any benzo...."


The normal range of responses to any benzo.  I think the funniest insult thrown at a benzo is when someone said etizolam feels like diphenhydramine. Then the next person says that about flualprazolam or some benzo.  Very funny responses as they are so individual.


I will say pyrazolam should be used as alprazolam is used.  I mean I can get sleepy on it but I don't take benzos a lot.  But I was aware at how quick it got rid of that anxiety in my chest. I consider it a good benzo.  Stronger than is posted about here.  1 mg is strong for me.  .5 seems best for those situations.


Also reading through the thread I notice alsotappered said it is not detectable 24 hours after taking. That may be one of the quickest benzos to exit the body.  I like that.  Not keen on these 48 hour half lives.  The quicker it can exit me the better.

Yeah, I wouldn't bother putting it up my nose. I may have tried snorting a pellet waaaaybback when it was legal in the UK, but I can't remember if it was really painful, but due to the ulcers I'd get taking it s/l I'd deffo rule out long term nasal use.

Oral was fine and hit quick like alprazolam tbh.

I also agree it should be used in place of alprazolam. Far less likely to cause dickheadedness and blackouts, but a great anxiolitic.

Sublingual use of benzodiazepines


![pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.bluelight.org/community/proxy.php?image=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov%2Fcoreutils%2Fnwds%2Fimg%2Ffavicons%2Ffavicon.png&hash=38a93253fc15d6430d52f4a6d11ea7d5&return_error=1)

					pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
				


TO THE EDITOR: Benzodiazepines, available in oral, intravenous, and intramuscular dosage forms, are widely used in the treatment of anxiety, insomnia, and muscle spasms. Some of these agents are also employed in preoperative sedation and in the management of various seizure disorders. The sublingual use of two benzodiazepines (lorazepam and triazolam) was recently described in a review by Sussman.' That information, however, was based on anecdotal reports, according to the author (personal communication, Norman Sussman, M.D., New York University School of Medicine, April 1985). 


Reports regarding this unique mode of benzodiazepine administration have been few. Caille and colleagues studied the pharmacokinetic properties of various lorazepam formulations, each given as asingle 2-mg dose! Sublingually administered lorazepam was absorbed more rapidly than that given orally. Furthermore, the sublingual route compared favorably with intramuscular injection into the deltoid muscle. It should be noted that three distinct tablet formulations were tested sublingually, one of which was the trade oral tablet. The absorption of the trade oral tablet when given sub lingually was superior to the same tablet given orally, but was somewhat inferior to a special sublingual tablet. Using the intramuscular preparation as the reference standard, the bioavailability of the oral tablet was higher when administered orally rather than sublingually. The same tablet, when given orally, was slightly more bioavailable than the standard intramuscular form, as was the special sublingual tablet.


 Greenblatt and associates in a similar study reported rapid and nearly complete absorption of lorazepam given sublingually either as the trade oral tablet or a specially formulated sublingual tablet using single 2-mg doses. Orally administered lorazepam was comparable with that given by the sublingual route. The intramuscular injection into the deltoid muscle was found to be the most rapidly absorbed of the three preparations, but differences in absorption were reportedly not significant. Gale et al. tested the efficacy of a sublingual preparation of lorazepam against an intramuscular injection of the same as premedication for 150 patients undergoing minor gynecological surgery. A single dose ranging from 2 to 4 rng was selected depending on the patient's weight. Those receiving the drug sublingually had less recall, an earlier onset of sedation, more drowsiness, and a longer recovery time than those who received the drug intramuscularly. The authors concluded that sublingual lorazepam was superior due to its rapid absorption resulting in more drowsiness and amnesia.' It is not known, however, whether the sublingual preparation used in this study was the trade oral tablet or a specially formulated sublingual tablet.

The delivery of lorazepam and other benzodiazepines by the sublingual route may offer significant advantages and increase their versatility. The trade oral tablet currently available in the U.S. is rapidly and nearly completely absorbed from both the oral mucosa and the gastrointestinal tract and, when used sublingually, compares favorably with intramuscular administration. Sublingual use may eliminate the need for intramuscular injections, which are often associated with pain and discomfort. The intramuscular form also requires refrigeration, has a short shelf-life, and is more expensive than oral tablets.' The sublingual route may also be used in patients who are unable to swallow, regardless of the etiology. A more attractive use of sublingual lorazepam may be in patients who are allowed nothing by mouth for whom parenteral administration is the only current alternative. In view of these possible benefits, we believe that the sublingual use of lorazepam and other benzodiazepines warrants further study to correlate pharmacokinetic data with concrete clinical evidence of efficacy.

I've tried around 30 different benzodiazepines and in every single case onset is comparable to IM injection. Pyrazolam was specifically designed to be water soluble as we initially intended to produce sublingual films BUT the only manufacturer able to produce the films was based in Japan and the lead-time was about 8 months. Too long since we had no idea how long it would take a Chinese vendor to offer a knock-off version. We need not have worried. I've been shown samples of Chinese-made pyrazolam and in every case it was yellow suggesting the presence of the intermediate thioamide. Now the thioamide isn't toxic BUT anyone who is happy to allow an impure produce is just as likely to leave the intermediate acetyl hydrazide and that most certainly IS something to be concerned about.


In nations like India sublingual clonazepam (banana flavoured) is produced for children. I do not think making tablets taste 'nice' is conducive to safety but their you go, it's not a guess, not even an educated guess. In fact, I note online that 'banana klonapin' was noted by people buying from shady sources.


BTW oral bioavailability of benzodiazepines is still very high but pyrazolam was specifically designed to be a selective anxiolytic with a fast onset and believe me, 1mg of the powder under the tongue worked in a matter of seconds and any you do swallow still winds up with 83% (oral) bioavailability.

The fisrt pellets contained 0.5 mg, but for me it starts working noticeable at about 3 mg. Even then it stays functional, it does make me a bit sleepy. but way lesss forced then Alprazolam. So yes totally agree on that. Its imo the better of the two. But hey what do dr's know ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) .

Yeah I have a low tolerance. But I wonder if those .5 pills from years ago were bunk?  Most people say they had to take a lot if you go back in this thread..  And other people said it did nothing.  But I can feel .5 mg.  I can feel it as it kicks in and takes the anxiety away.  Of course it could be low tolerance for me.  Some people here can take larger amounts of drugs too naturally.


I notice you found mulungu emkee.  I have said it for years, it will become important in the years ahead and a valid drug will come of it.  I was using mulungu to come down from psychedelics before I used etizolam.  A handful of the bark simmered for 20 minutes for sure affected me like 10 mgs of diazepam.  The only issue is there is a lot of bunk bark out there.  Valid bark works great though.

> TO THE EDITOR: Benzodiazepines, available in oral, intravenous, and intramuscular dosage forms, are widely used in the treatment of anxiety, insomnia, and muscle spasms. Some of these agents are also employed in preoperative sedation and in the management of various seizure disorders. The sublingual use of two benzodiazepines (lorazepam and triazolam) was recently described in a review by Sussman.' That information, however, was based on anecdotal reports, according to the author (personal communication, Norman Sussman, M.D., New York University School of Medicine, April 1985).
> 
> 
> 
> Reports regarding this unique mode of benzodiazepine administration have been few. Caille and colleagues studied the pharmacokinetic properties of various lorazepam formulations, each given as asingle 2-mg dose! Sublingually administered lorazepam was absorbed more rapidly than that given orally. Furthermore, the sublingual route compared favorably with intramuscular injection into the deltoid muscle. It should be noted that three distinct tablet formulations were tested sublingually, one of which was the trade oral tablet. The absorption of the trade oral tablet when given sub lingually was superior to the same tablet given orally, but was somewhat inferior to a special sublingual tablet. Using the intramuscular preparation as the reference standard, the bioavailability of the oral tablet was higher when administered orally rather than sublingually. The same tablet, when given orally, was slightly more bioavailable than the standard intramuscular form, as was the special sublingual tablet.

>  Greenblatt and associates in a similar study reported rapid and nearly complete absorption of lorazepam given sublingually either as the trade oral tablet or a specially formulated sublingual tablet using single 2-mg doses. Orally administered lorazepam was comparable with that given by the sublingual route. The intramuscular injection into the deltoid muscle was found to be the most rapidly absorbed of the three preparations, but differences in absorption were reportedly not significant. Gale et al. tested the efficacy of a sublingual preparation of lorazepam against an intramuscular injection of the same as premedication for 150 patients undergoing minor gynecological surgery. A single dose ranging from 2 to 4 rng was selected depending on the patient's weight. Those receiving the drug sublingually had less recall, an earlier onset of sedation, more drowsiness, and a longer recovery time than those who received the drug intramuscularly. The authors concluded that sublingual lorazepam was superior due to its rapid absorption resulting in more drowsiness and amnesia.' It is not known, however, whether the sublingual preparation used in this study was the trade oral tablet or a specially formulated sublingual tablet.

I have taken dozens of the original 0.5mg tablets sublingually with no issues whatsoever.


Now I've seen images of Chinese-made pyrazolam and it was YELOW and clumpy - I have no idea what the impurities were but I can 100% confirm that pure pyrazolam is white.

Even when we optimized the synthesis, we still had to use preparative chromatography to obtain the 99.8% purity we deemed safe. But their is a hydrazide intermediate which we decided had to entirely be removed for the product to be safe. Now I'm just guessing that the Chinese didn't male the effort to remove it...


It's also a potential carcinogen so I wouldn't touch it.


In ours the 0.2% was bromazepam (the precursor) and thiobromazepam (one of the intermediates).  Both are safe and indeed both are GABA PAMs but just not very potent so they essentially don't alter the subjective effects.


BTW another one from that series might be out soon. It's totally different but worthwhile.

Aftter Kratom my vendor suddenly offered Mulungu. Whole bark and a extract. These both were so unique as inducer's of sleep they alway's kept a warm place in my brain.


FFWD 10 + year's and its widely available in many forms. As i developed a sleeping disorder in the recent past. The past week I bought a bag of the Bark. Look's genuine but I have not tested it so fingers crossed. If my memory is correct it should work like a charm. It made me sleep totally unlike a dr. s sleep aid would. Even Melatonine feels more psychoactive then Mulungu as it makes my dreams more lucid.


The best sleepaid imo I've encountered, natural and synthetic's. Works on the cholinergic system, Where Nicotin is a anxiolytic Mulungu acts opposit as anti-anxiolytic. That it also worked against seizure's, anxiety and asthma was new to me.


JackARoe did you ever feel anything from it? As to me it seemed clear off any noticeable activity, it just made me sleep real good. With dreams, no groginess when waking up.

^ I did feel the mulungu.  Similar to how a small dose of diazepam hits but of course wore off quicker and cleaner.  I have zero benzo tolerance and at that time had not even had a benzo in years.  But coming down from a trip I could for sure feel the mulungu relax the body and mind.  I did use it for a few years before I tried etizolam.  For a while etizolam was all over and easier to get.   I do need to revisit mulungu as the only thing I did not get was amnesia.  A regular dose of a benzo will leave me with holes in my memory.  Pyrazolam too.  But mulungu just sort of slowed me down.


Amnesia from benzos is a very strange thing to me.  To almost not feel anything, think you are about sober and then the next day can not remember a bunch of things is a little freaky.  Makes me wonder how an amnesiac is used in medicine or if it is just a side effect of benzos.

Wonder if Mulungu will beat a Benzo in regard's to getting you to sleep? Think so.


There were nights I took hands of Benzo's ( brotizolam, norflurazepam and/ or flubromazepam) only to become relaxed, Muscle relaxation, amnesia and residual grogginess. Without actual sleeping. But Mulungu had non of these aspects. Then again I was pretty Benzo naieve 15 + years ago. And had no sleeping disorder.


Read up in my med records online yesterday.

They write I have Apneu, so should not sleep on my back, and no deep sleep/ NREM. Which means every proces in your body gets disrupted. Healing, immune function, neurogenesis and memory a.o..


Ps. Opipramol an discontinued med also had this effect on me. Clean sleep, nothing that resembled a Benzo or Anti-Histamine.

Mulungu (Erythrina  mulungu) appears to contain a mixture of alkaloids including erysotine and hypaphorine (and diverse other alkaloids in lower concentrations).


Now hypaphorine AKA (αS)-α-carboxy-N,N,N-trimethyl-1H-indole-3-ethanaminium, inner salt ANA tryptophan betaine which the body is able to decarboxylate to, wait for it, DMT and tryptophan. I'm sure people aware that the latter allows the body to readily produce serotonin which has previously been used as a sleep aid as the body is able to serotonin and melatonin.

Those you mention I have not even read about. Do they have similar action. Or other effects?

quoting Wiki about the leaves and bark effects by the two above.:

Clobazam has a ceiling I just recently know, ideal for anxiety btw. Maybe Pyrazolam has one too. At higher doses it does get 'sleepier', 3 mg. Never took more. 


Without answering your last question. Look it up its easy but not allowed to answer. Wondering atm how I could methaphorically answer it. And not breaking the rules. No the answer can easy be found check NCBI.com.

Ah, okay, I didn't realise that question isn't allowed, so will edit.  Certainly within the range I've taken it, effects ramp up with dosage, as you'd expect, and it is possible to become sleepy on a regular dose.  (Most I've done in one go is ~1.5mg.)  However, it's not what I'd use if encountering anxiety on stims or trying to get to sleep after a sesh.  It's main advantage (to me) is that it can be used for a very light effect.  As someone who gets a lot of anxiety, I'd rather use very occasionally and lightly (so almost close to placebo) so as not to become reliant.

Pyrazolam does have a ceiling but it's rather high. About 20mg. Take more and the (quite potent) effects simply last longer. 100mg, for example,, lasted around 5 days.


Don't forget, pyrazolam doesn't undergo metabolism - it's excreted unchanged to the more pertinent question is 'how fast can the body excrete pyrazolam'?

Recently I had posted about trying pyrazolam.  But something really struck me as too important to not address. It could be internet banter, reddit crap or whatever, but people are saying there has been no pyrazolam in a few years and anything we get today is not pyrazolam.  Now I can say what I bought hit quick, lasted not too long and was not sedative at all unless I sat down and shut my eyes.  But seems a lot of Reddit know it allss say we are getting something other than pyrazolam.  Turns out a few people tested a few vendors powders and it came back as bromazolam or bromonordiazepam.  I can say what I had was not like bromazolam at all.  And I understand bromonordiazepam takes a while to hit and lasts a day.  And honestly if what I had was not pyrazolam then whatever it was that enabled me to work one day in a decent stress free mood without being drowsy was good.  If it is not pyrazolam a vendor should come clean as it was a decent benzo.


But what all this says to me is I had always wondered about some vendors.  When someone describes FXE we realize it may not be that chemical.  But we have megathreads of people describing the effects of the substance they bought.  I guess this all goes back to the quality we all deserve and sometimes the crap we get fed.  I mean I assume vendors are out to make money.  Why would they care about correct labeling or quality.


For me I never bought RC's.  I was always gifted them from people that were in the know and already vetted it.  My little pyrazolam purchase was on my own, and when I finally do something on my own I am hearing it is not real.   So we either have know it alls on reddit calling everyone dumb for thinking they have pyrazolam or it truly is not being made today.  I can't tell where the truth is.

It's synthesis is too complex. It took 18 attempts to perfect just the amine --> thioamide step.


When flubromazolam is an order of magnitude more potent, why make pyrazolam? The whole point of pyrazolam was it was just a safer anxiolytic. It was never meant to be used to get high.


I took a silly amount because it was my project.


Pynazolam and pyeyzolam are more interesting.

Yes that is the banter I am reading.  And expensive.  So to that I say whatever I had should be made public.  It was good.  I can not put that into any of the other categories of benzos.  It was not bromazolam (no placebo effect) but i also never had any of the other ones that were just banned besides etizolam.  I doubt a vendor would use those and it seems the others were very long lasting.


Who knows, maybe it was pyrazolam.  I just wanted to address the ideas about some of the substances and effects we post about.  I had always wondered if everyone always gets what they think they bought.  And also makes me wonder if I should delete my posts although people post about a drug without testing it.  But we should be aware that we may not have what we think.

It was specifically designed to be less abusable and less dependence-forming than other benzos. You didn't miss anything special.

What I had for sure had abusable qualities.  ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)   Not so much for me but anything that hits quick without sedation would be abusable for someone.


Thanks AT-2, I was wondering if you had suspicions and you did earlier in the thread.  I mean unless we test any drug we get we can never be 100% sure.  Just something to be aware of.

Well nothing special in is how you look at it. As I find it a very valuelable benzo because of it's lack of to much sedative or cognitive effect's. If I had the choice Clobazam would be perfect, Pyrazolam is a close second one. Just ordered it.

I agree. We wanted to explore the QSAR or many related compounds and since pyrazolam is made from bromazepam, it was the easiest place to start. the nitro homologue, pynazolam has a really unexpected action in increasing extra cellular serotonin levels so it's a very prompt-acting anxiolytic with robust antidepressant activity. A nice detail is that unlike every other nitrobenzodiazepine, the aromatic nitro moiety isn't reduced so no toxic metabolite (toxic compared to other benzodiazepine metabolites).


Then pyeyzolam is a very selective a1b1y2 PAM and I will be blunt - it makes you drunk. It isn't potent but we worked up to 30mg and it feels like a couple of bottles of wine. But unlike alcohol it doesn't cause amnesia, mood lability, aggression and loss of executive function. Nobody is going to take pyeyzolam and pick a fight, go on a crying jag or forget what they did while under the incluance.


We did actually produce pysazolam which replaces the 8-ethynyl moiety with a trimethylsilyl moiety. In animal models this was also a5b1y3 selective and apparently similar to pyeyzolam but it was more toxic. 


Could we have done more? Well the pseudohalogens might have been interesting but the things we sought were:


1)Selective a1b1y2 PAM

2)Selective a5b1y2 PAM

3)Selective a2/a3b1y2 PAM.


So we were lucky in that with this class of compound, the in-silico modelling worked.


I should add that the giant in the field of mapping EVERY SINGLE different subtype of the benzodiazepine site of the GABA receptor was carried out over 20+ years by one Professor James T. Cook at MCU. He's forgotten more than I will ever know. He did a lot of work and it makes an interesting read.

Thank's for inventing some very interesting compounds. Pynazolam and Pyeyzolam never became available to me, but I would def try them. Probably with great expectation's, after your post. "Long shot, kick it it bucket".


Why wasn't any exploration done on the -Zam's.

"Long shot fail"? Pagoclone was a fail. I tried it, no Ethanol replacement.

I do hope you get the chance to try them. I am informed that someone in another nation is now perfecting their own pynazolam synthesis and presuming they do, you will be able to give your opinion. For me it was the antidepressant activity. I wondered if doctors could prescribe it's short term use in people suffering clinical depression. Just to span the time it takes for more conventional antidepressants to work.


I would guess 5mg [TID] as it improves mood but isn't euphoric per se. Not perfect but of utility to doctors (well, patients).

Due to some Epileptic insults i got slight acces to Clobazam and found  it very special.


Never abused it, it suppossedly has a ceiling to the effect's. But for a Benzo it was so different that it would deserve some more analogue's, just to see where it possibility's lie..

Bought this as a substitute to my declining stash of valium to taper off with, this is one of the cleanest benzos I've ever taken, but these 3mg tabs are as small as a microdot almost and I can only crush them into powder to reduce the dosage, which sucks. I think earlier in the day I only took 0,5 by what little amount I was able to cut off with scissors, just took the rest and 15 mins later I'm uh, extremely calm, no sedation whatsoever, no euphoria either, bit lightheaded maybe. I've been doing valium daily for a couple months now, so it's a notable difference. I like it, feel like it will come in handy in certain situations, but yeah, tapering from 20-5mg valium daily and then taking 3mg pyrazolam is pretty much back to square one. At least the anxiety about running out is gone.

Yeah, its perceptible at very low doses, like 500ug, maybe less. One of the most clearheaded benzos.


High doses (like 5mg) kind of make me feel depressed and anhedonic. Higher doses can cause sedation as well as disinhibition.

Anhedonic is pretty to the point at this dosage, I can get very emotional on valium, I feel like this blunts all emotions more effectively than anything I can recall so far.

Well I gave pyraz another shot and it’s versatility is impressive. As others have stated, the ratio of sedation to anxyiolyis is ideal for daytime use without compromising memory. Mind you I just detoxed of a brutal amount of benzos 4 months ago and forgot how severe symptoms are. How i became dependent on them once more is beyond me. Been stuck on them on and off for half my life, but this last run lasted daily round the clock for 3 years straight, going through untold amounts of RC powder particularly etizolam, bromazolam, and norflu (which became my ultimate fav, but the concurrent half-life’s begin to build like crazy). Still not right after nearly half a year of cessation. Anxiety is way worse than before benzos. I’ve detoxed off every drug imaginable and nothing comes close to benzos. Also just killed a gram of 3-ho-pcp in under a month somehow.


I’m a bit confused of pyraz water solubility. Will saline not do the job? I know IV benzos is superfluous, but have one rig and want to bang a 4f-mph goofball (4f-mph is quite lackluster as well, but feels way smoother then other ROAs). Normal mph has a pronounced rush so perhaps it’s the fluoronation hindrance.

Their must be demand for Pyrazolam atm its available, 3 mg pellets. They are not sedating or long acting. 

Actually they are on the edge of unnoticeable. Its an wonderful creation on par with Clobazam ime. Thanks ![🍁](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f341.png)


Given the choice, which is absurd atm, Flubromazolam is not even a benzo i would buy again, same for Bromazolam. 


And what was really a dud was DesMethylFlunitrazepam, sounds good/ did nothing as far as i could tell. 

The vendor accidently twice sent me this instead of what i ordered, 2-nd i returned  it and got what i orderd. 

Not worth trying, but who knows others may like it.

It's a pure anxiolytic. Little sedation and hypnotic. Very functional. First dose is the strongest. Many say it's their favorite and wants some.

Hey guys I was recently blessed with the opportunity to try out pyrazolam and since it's kinda rare I decided to look into other ROA to increase bioavailibility. 


I've read several times that benzos can still be boofed despite most being non soluble in water . Apparently they just need be suspended in a solution but don't neto actually dissolve. 


Well Apparently pyrazolam does happen to be water soluble and many say it is very effective when plugged.  So I'm just wondering from those who had tried successfully, is pyrazolam really water soluble and do i need to make a solution with ethanol or PG or is water alone gonna work fine for rectal administration?


Thanks!

In my research for ALDH inhibitors I found Durian fruit contains some, including diethyl disulfide.

It's excreted through your kidneys unchanged, just eat it. Rectal use of benzo is only really needed at home if a family member/partner is having a seizure.  Or, for riskier users, you realize you took too much of a stimulant or psychedelic and need to abort, ASAP.


With few exceptions, there is no real rush plugging recreational benzos, IV'd. A rare exception would be when plasma levels are reached very fast, as seems to be the case with Avizafone vs Diazepam (which can causes some antidepressant effect, for those with little tolerance or in withdrawal.


"Effective"


That said, you would reach higher plasma levels faster, which may be desirable and feel a euphoric "relief" from feeling "fine". That's al it does; it's a sobering benzo imho.
