# MDMA

## Effects
MDMA mainly causes an increased release of the body's own messenger substance serotonin. At the recommended dosage, about 80% of the available serotonin at that time is released. This release triggers a feeling of euphoria, lightness and light-heartedness. Sight and hearing change, touch and music are felt more intensely, inhibitions are reduced and the need for contact is increased. The effect is described as empathogenic (triggering a feeling of closeness and connection to other people) and entactogenic (touching the inner self, intensifying emotional perception). The simultaneous release of the neurotransmitters noradrenalin and dopamine has a stimulating effect. This reduces the feeling of hunger and thirst as well as tiredness and increases alertness. Body temperature and blood pressure also rise.

## Dosage
Swallowed max. 1.5 mg MDMA per kg body weight for men, max. 1.3 mg per kg body weight for women. Lower doses are recommended for rectal and nasal use.

## Risks

### Short-term Risks
Side effects are jaw spasms, muscle tremors, urinary retention, headache, nausea/vomiting, increased pulse and blood pressure. The heart, liver and kidneys are particularly stressed. There is also a risk of life-threatening overheating as body temperature rises and the body becomes dehydrated. In the case of an overdose, hallucinations are possible. When the effect wears off or on the days afterwards, depressive moods may occur.

### Long-term Risks
After a consumption experience, the body needs at least 4 weeks to regenerate the serotonin balance. If one does not allow oneself this break in the long term and consumes repeatedly after short breaks, the probability of a permanent restriction of spatial awareness increases. This risk also exists after repeated high doses. Intense and prolonged use of ecstasy can also lead to a change in the serotonin system. A form of dependence with psychological symptoms can develop, especially if ecstasy use is linked to a certain activity, for example if it is always used at parties and partying without ecstasy afterwards is no longer possible. In the case of snorting, the nasal mucous membranes and the nasal wall are damaged. Rectal use can cause irritation in the rectum.

## Safer Use
- If you want to be sure that your pill really contains MDMA and know the dose, use drug checking. If this is not possible, first consume only one third of the pill.
- Do not add more right away, but wait two hours for the full effect and then decide.
- Avoid mixed use with other substances.
- Avoid alcohol and drink enough non-alcoholic beverages. Approx. 3 dl per hour is enough. Isotonic drinks are best to avoid hyponatremia ("water intoxication").
- Take breaks from dancing at parties and get some fresh air.
- Do not wear headgear, except in strong sun (danger of overheating!).
- Do not take ecstasy immediately after a meal, but also not on an empty stomach. It is advisable to have a light, healthy meal a few hours before.
- Accept when the effect runs out. "Re-spiking" increases the toxicity (poisonousness) of MDMA.
- Give yourself time to recover and take regular breaks (at least 4-6 weeks) to restore serotonin levels.
- If you use MDMA nasally, follow the safe-sniffing rules. If consuming rectally, use lubricant to minimise the risk of rectal irritation.
- If you are taking medication, ask your doctor about possible interactions. If you are taking psychotropic drugs, the use of MDMA is strongly discouraged (risk of serotonin syndrome)!
- Ecstasy can cause asthma attacks in asthmatics and epileptic seizures in epileptics.
- People with high blood pressure, heart problems, hyperthyroidism, liver and kidney diseases or circulatory problems should refrain from using MDMA.

## Adulterants & Extenders

In addition to the side effects typical of MDMA, there is a risk of taking misdeclared substances, pharmacologically active extenders and high-dose tablets when consuming ecstasy tablets. Even ecstasy tablets with the same logo or appearance can differ greatly in terms of composition. In 2020, a warning was issued for 90.8 % of the ecstasy tablets analysed due to a high MDMA content (> 120 mg MDMA). 41.7 % of the tablets contained more than 200 mg MDMA in 2020. Such high doses can lead to health problems.

### Common Adulterants

**MBDB**

**MDA**

**MDEA**

**Synthesis by-products MDMA**
In addition to DPIA (bis-amphetamine or di(beta-phenylisopropyl)amines), MDP2P and 1-benzyl-3-methylnaphthalene were analysed in ecstasy tablets. Little information is available on the risks of these synthetic by-products, and the interaction potential between these synthetic by-products and MDMA is completely unknown. MDP2P(3,4-methylenedioxy-phenylpropan-2-one) is a precursor substance for the synthesis (production) of MDMA. This is an indication of an incomplete synthesis process. The risks and side effects of this substance are unknown and there is no information on mixed use with MDMA. Whether and how MDP2P influences the risk of consumption cannot be assessed.

**Metoclopramide**
Metoclopramide is a medicine that is taken for problems in the gastrointestinal tract. It relieves nausea, irritable stomach and heartburn and prevents vomiting.

**PMMA**

**m-CPP**
m-CPP (meta-chlorophenyl-piperazine=1-(3-chlorophenyl)-piperazine) is a piperazine derivative in powder form and is mostly sold as ecstasy in pill form.

**PMA**
PMA or paramethoxyamphetamine is a stimulant and hallucinogenic substance, closely related are PMEA, 4-ETA, 4-MTA.
