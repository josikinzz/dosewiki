MDMA
 
Basics

DESCRIPTION #
 
[MDMA Images](https://erowid.org/mdma_images.shtml)
 
MDMA, or 'ecstasy' is a 'psychedelic amphetamine' that has gained popularity over the past 20 years because of its ability to produce strong feelings of comfort, empathy, and connection to others. It most frequently comes in tablet form, although it is also found in capsules or as powder. It is most frequently used orally and rarely snorted. MDMA use is closely tied to the underground rave (and dance club) scene throughout the world, but has also been widely used by therapists as an adjunct to psychotherapy. 
 
 Because MDMA is so popular and because it goes well with dance parties, the demand for it usually exceeds supply--especially at any given location on any given night. This creates an opening for unscrupulous individuals to sell virtually anything as 'ecstasy'. While 'ecstasy' is the popular name for MDMA, the functional definition of ecstasy is any pill represented as MDMA on the street. Ecstasy pills are notoriously unreliable in content, more so than most other street drugs, and commonly contain either [caffeine](https://erowid.org/../caffeine/caffeine.shtml) , [ephedrine](https://erowid.org/../ephedrine/ephedrine.shtml) , [amphetamines](https://erowid.org/../amphetamines/amphetamines.shtml) , [MDA](https://erowid.org/../mda/mda.shtml) , [MDE](https://erowid.org/../mde/mde.shtml) , [DXM](https://erowid.org/../dxm/dxm.shtml) , or--in rare cases-- [DOB](https://erowid.org/../dob/dob.shtml) , and don't necessarily contain MDMA or any psychoactive. This problem has led to the development of simple [MDMA testing kits](https://erowid.org/mdma_faq_testing_kits.shtml) that may help give the user a general sense of the content of a pill.

Effects Classification [#](https://erowid.org/effects-classification)
 
Euphoric Empathogen; Euphoric Stimulant; Entactogen; Phenethylamine
 
[Dose](https://erowid.org/mdma_dose.shtml) #
 
A standard oral dose of MDMA is between 80-150 mg. Most good quality pills contain somewhere in this range, generally 80-120 mg. A large percentage of users find that, unlike with many other psychoactives such as LSD or mushrooms, there is a 'sweet spot' in MDMA dosage. Once this spot is found, higher dosages are not particularly desirable as they don't increase the sought after effects or duration.
 
Price #
 
The price of MDMA varies wildly depending on where it's purchased and in what quantity. Prices are much higher in the United States and Canada than they are in Europe. In the U.S., a single tablet purchased at a commercial event can cost as much as $50 though more commonly $10-$25. In the United States, purchased in higher quantities MDMA generally sells for $80-$200 per gram (about $8-25 per dose), with wholesale prices as low as $40 per gram. In Europe, in 2008 and 2009, prices were much lower at around 30-80 Euro per gram and 2-8 Euro per tablet.
 
[Law](https://erowid.org/mdma_law.shtml) #
 
MDMA is illegal in the United States (Schedule I) and in most other countries. It is also listed as Schedule I in the International Convention on Psychotropic Substances, an international drug control treaty.
 
[Chemistry](https://erowid.org/mdma_chemistry.shtml) #
 
3,4-methylenedioxy-N-methamphetamine (MDMA) is a synthetic chemical that can be derived from an essential oil of the sassafras tree.

[History](https://erowid.org/mdma_timeline.php) #
 
MDMA was first synthesized in the 1890s and later patented by Merck pharmaceuticals on December 24, 1912, but it wasn't until the mid 1970s that articles related to its psychoactivity began showing up in scholarly journals. In the late '70s and early '80s MDMA was used as a psychotherapeutic tool and also started to become available on the street. Its growing popularity led to it being made illegal in the United States in 1985 and its popularity has continued to increase since then.
 
Terminology / Slang #
 
The Substance:
 
MDMA; Ecstasy; X; XTC; E; M; Adam; Molly, Thizz, Beans (Tablets); Rolls.
 
The Experience:
 
Rolling; X-ing; Thizzing; Wigging; Tripping.
 
[EFFECTS](https://erowid.org/mdma_effects.shtml) #
 
When the full effects of MDMA manifest, barring an uncommon negative reaction, users are likely to find that suddenly everything is right with the world. The primary effects sought by those using MDMA recreationally are the emotional openness, euphoria, stimulation, reduction of critical and cynical thoughts, and decrease of inhibitions that can accompany its use. MDMA is used by some individuals in a therapeutic setting to attempt to work through difficult interpersonal issues. Although MDMA can cause nystagmus (eye wiggles), most individuals experience few prominent open or closed eye visuals. A small percentage of users report significant visual distortions.
 
Onset #
 
Depending on how much and how recently one has eaten food, MDMA generally takes 30-60 minutes (although sometimes as long as 2 hours) to take effect. Unlike with many other psychoactives, the onset of MDMA is very quick. Often at the point one realizes that perhaps they are starting to notice effects, they are already 'launching' quickly towards the peak. This quick and extremely sharp 'launch' can be unnerving, feeling a bit like it's too quick and hard to know when it's going to end, but the feeling generally only lasts a few minutes until the full effects are reached.
 
Duration #
 
The primary effects of MDMA last approximately 3-4 hours when taken orally. For many people there is an additional period of time (2-6 hrs) where it is difficult to go to sleep and there is definitely a noticeable difference from everyday reality, but which is not strong enough to be considered 'tripping'. Many people also experience a noticeable shift in mood for several days after use; for some this is a period of depression while others experience lifted mood.
 
Visual Effects #
 
Visuals Summary Needed.
 
The Crash #
 
Some users of MDMA experience a dramatic worsening of mood as the peak effects wear off, often called the "crash". This is often the result of coming down from a wonderful experience, not wanting the feelings to go away, and being sad, scared, or annoyed afterwards. Crashes do not happen after every experience and some users never experience them. One of the primary problems associated with crashing is that some users find themselves redosing in order to stave it off.
 
Hangover #
 
**[Hangover and the Week After](https://erowid.org/mdma_effects_hangover1.shtml)** 
 Many users report feeling extremely drained the day after MDMA use. This 'day after' effect means for many MDMA users that they need to plan 2 days for the experience: one for the peak experience and one recovery day, with very little planned. Many users also experience some level of post-MDMA depression, often starting on the second day after the experience and lasting for up to 5 days. A small percentage of users report depressive symptoms for weeks afterwards. Alternately, some users report feeling better than normal for a week or so after taking MDMA. The negative after-effects of taking MDMA appear to be worse with higher frequencies of use, higher dosages, and perhaps total lifetime usage.
 
[PROBLEMS](https://erowid.org/mdma_health.shtml) #
 
One of the primary problems with MDMA is the low quality of street ecstasy. Street ecstasy, especially pressed pills, is often mixed with a wide variety of adulterants that can cause a variety of negative side effects both unpleasant and dangerous. MDMA is a known neurotoxin, but how damaging it is to use is very controversial and [quite complex](https://erowid.org/mdma_journal.shtml#neurotoxicity) . 
 
 Negative effects can include overheating, nausea, vomiting, jaw-clenching, eye-twitching, and dizziness, as well as depression and fatigue in following days. After frequent or heavy use, some users report bouts of dizziness or vertigo which gradually subside after cessation of use. There have been problems with MDMA users experiencing [dehydration, hyperthermia, hyponatremia](https://erowid.org/mdma_health_water.shtml) , exhaustion, blackouts, and a few cases of death generally while using MDMA at clubs or raves. MDMA users would be wise to drink water and take occasional breaks. 
 
 Another possible difficult situation arising from MDMA use is the release of emotions which one may be unprepared to deal with. This could include confronting past episode of abuse, re-experiencing painful memories, encountering emotional crises, or unearthing previously unrecognized feelings either alone or while in conversation with friends and loved ones. In these situations, therapists suggest one should try to remain calm and avoid fighting the feelings. Find a supportive friend and a safe, comfortable space to sit while working through the feelings. If at all possible, try to find support among friends as emergency rooms are poorly equipped to handle emotional crises. 
 
 Many users report that their enjoyment of MDMA seems to decrease as total lifetime usage increases. Some users report that E 'loses its magic' with as few as 10 experiences, while others have reported hundreds of uses before the empathic qualities fades or disappears. Most users stop taking E because of either an increased awareness or an actual increase in negative side effects during use, a reduced quality of the high, and increases in the post-MDMA depression and day after hangover. Most users report that when using more than once a month, or merely over increased total lifetime use, they need to increase the dosage in order to get positive effects with MDMA. Increased dosage is associated with increased side effects, hangover, and week-after depression.
 
Contraindications #
 
- Do not take MDMA if you are currently taking an MAOI. MAOIs are most commonly found in the prescription anti-depressants Nardil (phenelzine), Parnate (tranylcypromine), Marplan (isocarboxazid), Eldepryl (l-deprenyl), and Aurorex or Manerix (moclobemide). Ayahuasca also contains MAOIs (harmine and harmaline). MDMA and MAOIs are a potentially dangerous combination. Check with your doctor if you are not sure whether your prescription medication is an MAOI. Avoid taking MDMA if you are currently using the protease inhibitor Ritonavir. This may be a life-threatening combination. Individuals with a history of heart ailments, high blood pressure, aneurysm or stroke, glaucoma, hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) disorders, or hypoglycemia may be at higher risk. Avoid strong stimulants in combination with MDMA. Avoid high doses and frequent use. Recent studies suggest that the heavier and more frequent the use, the more concerning the long term after-effects may be. A small percentage (1-10% depending on race & family history) are "slow metabolizers", who have low levels of a liver enzyme (P450 2D6) which metabolizes many drugs, including MDMA (as well as Prozac, DXM, and many other pharmaceuticals). These people may be more sensitive to MDMA, might require lower doses, and should be cautious.
 
Addiction Potential #
 
MDMA has the potential to be psychologically addicting. Individuals who use it regularly may find they have an increased desire to continue using it. There is a short period of tolerance after MDMA use. Using MDMA two days in a row is likely to lead to a greatly diminished experience the second day, though spaced 7 or more days apart, this effect is lessened. Some users report noticing reduced effects for up to 2 or 3 weeks after initial use.
 
Long Term Health Problems #
 
There is an ongoing debate about the possible neurotoxicity of MDMA. Most experts now agree that MDMA is neurotoxic, but there is little agreement on what the consequences of this toxicity are. Alcohol is also a neurotoxin, for instance, as are many other medications. There is some evidence of changes to the brain in those who use MDMA heavily and/or frequently and a few studies have shown reductions in memory & increases in depression and anxiety, but these studies have not been completely verified and debate continues. This is a very complicated issue.

DESCRIPTION #
 
Some people are considerably more sensitive to MDMA than others. Those using MDMA for the first time or using material of an unknown purity and strength should be extremely careful. 
 
 Based on research from multiple labs, the effects of MDMA can increase non-linearly with increases in dosage. That is, increasing dosage from 100mg to 120mg (a 20% increase in dosage) can cause more than a 20% increase in experiential effects level. See [Harris DS, Baggott M, et al. 2002](https://erowid.org/references/1410) and [de la Torre R, Farre M, et al. 2000](https://erowid.org/references/382) . The current theory is that some metabolic pathway becomes saturated/overwhelmed somewhere around 1.5mg/kg and above, resulting in higher plasma levels and effects levels. The specific metabolic reason for this non-linearity [has not yet been proven](https://erowid.org/mdma_pharmacology1.shtml) .
 
CAUTION & DISCLAIMER #
 
Erowid's effects information is a summary of data gathered from users, research, and other resources. This information is intended to describe the range of effects people report experiencing. Effects may vary dramatically from one person to another or one experience to another based on a variety of factors such as body chemistry, age, gender, physical health, dose, form of material, etc.

MDMA Dosage
 
by Erowid
 
---
 
 
MDMA generally comes in the form of small tablets, capsules, or white powder. When found in tablet form (often referred to as "ecstasy"), it is common for MDMA to be combined with any of the following substances : MDMA, Caffeine, MDA, Methamphetamine, DXM, MDE, Pseudo/Ephedrine, Ketamine, BZP, and TFMPP. Chemical analysis of ecstasy tablets has found from 0 - 120 mg of MDMA as well as a variety of the above substances. Trying to calculate dosages from tablets containing unknown quantities of MDMA can be difficult, but a high quality tablet of street ecstasy (those containing MDMA alone) generally contains between 80 and 120 mg of MDMA. Some unusual tablets (especially in Europe) [contain 150mg or more](http://drugsdata.org/results.php?high_dose_mdma=1) . The chart below shows what are considered recreational/therapeutic dosages for pure MDMA HCl (the most common crystalline form), measured in milligrams. Note that most Ecstasy and even crystalline MDMA is not 100% pure and may contain fillers or other drugs. See [DrugsData.org (formerly EcstasyData)](http://www.drugsdata.org/) . 
 
 
- Oral MDMA Dosages: Oral MDMA Dosages
**Oral MDMA Dosages**
- Threshold: 30 mg
- Light: 40 - 75 mg
- Common (small or sensitive people): 60 - 90 mg
- Common (most people): 75 - 125 mg
- Common (large or less sensitive people): 110 - 150 mg
- Strong: 150 - 200 mg
- Heavy: 200 + mg
 
 Onset : 20 - 70 minutes (depending on form and stomach contents) 
 Duration : 3 - 5 hours 
 Normal After Effects : up to 24 hours 
 
---
 
 **Overdose Effects:** 
 Vomiting, headaches and dizziness may result from too high a dose of MDMA. Some people are considerably more sensitive to MDMA than others. Be careful if you are using MDMA for the first time or using material of an unknown purity and strength. Always start low.
 
**Every individual reacts differently to every chemical. Know your Body - Know your Mind - Know your Substance - Know your Source. Erowid's dosage information is a summary of data gathered from users, research, and other resources and should not be construed as recommendations. Individuals can respond differently to the same dosage. What is safe for one can be deadly for another. Start low with new substances. Have trusted companion/guide/sitter/friend present and/or available.**

Health
 
by Erowid
 
**WARNINGS** : 
 
- Dangerous Interaction : MAOIs. Do not take MDMA if you are currently taking prescription MAOIs. MAOIs are most commonly found in the prescription anti-depressants Nardil (phenelzine), Parnate (tranylcypromine), Marplan (isocarboxazid), Eldepryl (l-deprenyl), and Aurorix / Manerix (moclobemide). Ayahuasca also contains MAOIs (harmine and harmaline). MDMA and MAOIs are a potentially dangerous combination.
- Dangerous Interaction: Protease Inhibitors. Avoid taking MDMA if you are currently using the protease inhibitor Ritonavir. This may be a life-threatening combination. See [Case Report: Interaction between MDMA and Ritonavir (Norvir)](https://erowid.org/mdma_info1.shtml) .
- Dangerous overheating. MDMA use can lead to hyperthermia (overheating) especially in those who are exerting themselves for long periods of time. It is important for users to pay attention to their bodies and make sure they aren't overheating. Take breaks from dancing. Step outside for a moment if the temperature in the room is high. Make sure to drink enough, but not too much, water.
- Individual sensitivity varies widely. A small percentage of users seem to react with extreme sensitivity to MDMA and experience overly strong effects at normal doses, including hyponatremia, unconsciousness, seizures, and other serious medical problems.
- Stimulant combinations can be dangerous. Avoid other strong stimulants in combination with MDMA, which can increase heart rate, blood pressure, and body temperature risks.
- Water Poisoning. Some ecstasy users overreact to the overheating and dehydration issue by obsessively over-drinking. When drinking large amounts of water it's important to mix in sports drinks or salty snacks to avoid the [very real dangers of water poisoning and hyponatremia](https://erowid.org/mdma_health_water.shtml) (low salt), which can cause serious health problems including death. MDMA can cause changes in the body's antidiuretic hormone, leading to much higher susceptibility to hyponatremia. Drink water, but don't drink too much.
- Seizures. A small number of MDMA users have reportedly had seizures after taking moderate amount of pure MDMA, more common in smaller women and with higher doses. See [References Search: MDMA Seizure](https://erowid.org/references/refs.php?A=SearchAdvanced&Abstract=mdma+seizure) and [Experience Search: MDMA & seizure](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.cgi?S1=3&Str=seizure) .
 
 
**CAUTIONS** : 
 
- Health Condition Contraindications. Individuals with a history of heart ailments, high blood pressure, aneurism or stroke, glaucoma, hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) disorders, or hypoglycemia may be at higher risk.
- Hyponatremia. Some users seem particularly sensitive to MDMA's effects on the antidiuretic hormone (ADH, aka Vasopressin) which can lead to serious or even fatal hyponatremia, even without ingesting too much water. See [References Search: MDMA & hyponatremia](https://erowid.org/references/refs.php?A=Search&Abstract=mdma+hyponatremia) .
- Neurotoxicity Risk of long term changes to serotonin increases with dose and frequency of use. Though complex, people who use very high doses, re-dose repeatedly, or take MDMA frequently could experience mild, but persisting reductions in certain types of verbal memory or a mild increase in depressive symptoms. See [MDMA Neurotoxicity](https://erowid.org/mdma_neurotoxicity.shtml) .
- May worsen depression. MDMA use can exacerbate depression in some users and cause depressions with heavy or frequent use.
- Crashing after peak. MDMA use can cause severe [crashes](https://erowid.org/mdma_effects2.shtml) after the peak effects wane, resulting in depressed mood, crying, and extreme lethargy in some users.
- Hangover. MDMA can cause [hangovers](https://erowid.org/mdma_effects_hangover1.shtml) in some users lasting between 1 and 7 days.
- Frequent use may worsen symptoms. Avoid high doses and frequent use. Over the last 15 years, many studies have shown that the higher the dose and more frequent the use, the worse the long term after-effects may be.
 
 
**PURITY ISSUES** : 
 One of the primary problems with MDMA is the low quality of the material sold on the street to recreational users. Tablets of street "ecstasy" frequently contain an assortment of psychoactive substances, either mixed with MDMA, or in place of it, or may contain no active ingredients at all. Other substances found in street ecstasy include MDA, MDE, PMA, caffeine, ephedrine, amphetamines, DXM, and occasionally DOB. 
 
 Caffeine, ephedrine, and amphetamines will produce less empathic effects than MDMA with more stimulation and feelings of restlessness. MDA and MDE are both similar in effects to MDMA and it may be difficult for even experienced users to distinguish between them. MDE is slightly shorter in duration than MDMA and generally has a lower peak and less euphoria than MDMA. MDA lasts longer and generally produces more visuals and psychedelic effects than MDMA. The effects of DXM, which has become more common in street ecstasy, can be extremely unpleasant if you're not expecting them: strong disorientation, dizziness, nausea, grogginess or strong sedation, and at high enough doses, dissociation from the body.

**DEATHS** : 
 
- Rachel Clute (April 10, 2012), 19, died of "anoxic encephalopathy due to toxic effects of methamphetamine and ecstasy" according to the Honolulu Medical Examiner's Office. [ [HawaiiNewsNow](http://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/story/17405734/police-investigate-death-of-uh-hilo-athlete) , [Star Advertiser](http://www.staradvertiser.com/news/breaking/147271455.html?id=147271455) ]
- A paper documented 202 deaths in England and Wales associated with Ecstasy between 1996 and 2002. Only 17% of these had "ecstasy" (MDMA, MDA, MDE, or PMA) as the sole drug involved. ( [Schifano et al. 2003](https://erowid.org/references/refs_view.php?ID=6209) )
- An examination of ecstasy-related deaths in Florida found at least 7 were caused by [PMA](https://erowid.org/chemicals/pma/) and not MDMA/MDA/MDE. See [Ecstasy Deaths in the State of Florida: A Post-Mortem Analysis](https://erowid.org/references/refs_view.php?ID=7640) (Goldberger et al. 2002)

**U.S. FEDERAL LEGAL SUMMARY**
**MDMA**

MDMA is Schedule I in the United States. This means it is illegal to manufacture, buy, possess, or distribute (sell, trade or give) without a DEA license. 
 
 MDMA is being studied for medical utility around the world. The medical research may eventually result in changes to the legal status. However the bad design of the United Nations 1970 Single Convention on Psychotropic Substances and the United States' worse Controlled Substances Act will inhibit and hamstring moving psilocybin out of the class of drugs that have near-total prohibition.
