​

**Description:**


> AL-LAD is an alkenated / alkylenated analogue of (6-nor-)LSD, or differently put a 'homologue' of LSD, that has a slightly lower potency in practice and somewhat shorter duration of effects than LSD although it showed higher potency in theory. It gained recognition after Alexander Shulgin described the substance in the book TIHKAL, although David Nichols and Albert Hofmann described AL-LAD 12 years before that in an article. However until recently AL-LAD has not been known to have been available on the market.
> 
> Because it is not an alkyl analogue it bypasses UK drug analogue laws. In this early stage of availability on the market AL-LAD is quickly gaining popularity, having a lot of the virtues of LSD and even advantages over it, although opinions and reactions always vary as per YMMV.
> 
> Until recently history of use in humans was quite limited, and positive reports do not guarantee physical safety. If it has remotely the therapeutic index LSD has it should be considered physically quite safe, but has not yet been proven, as far as I know.

**Wiki & Analysis Data:**


**NSFW**: 


> Brief overview - What is AL-LAD?
> 
> 
> 
> AL-LAD novel hallucinogenic developed originally by David E. Nichols and popularized by Alexander Shulgin. It closely resembles LSD in chemical structure and has very similar dosages and effects.
> 
> Chemical and physical properties
> 
> 
> 
> AL-LAD is a 6-alkylated analogue of nor-LSD. (mod edit: the allyl group is an **alkenyl**, not an alkyl, because of the double bond)
> 
> Effects
> 
> 
> 
> Effects can be felt within a quarter hour to an hour or more. Physically the experience can include a warm body high, elevated heart rate and increased energy. Visually the effects are similar to that of LSD (depending on the individual). Users often report euphoria and music enhancement. Some users report a merge between audio and visual aspects of the experience.
> 
> Pharmacology, toxicity and general safety
> 
> 
> 
> DOSAGE : 80 - 160 micrograms +.
> 
> DURATION : 6 - 8 hours.
> 
> Very little is known at this stage about the toxicity of AL-LAD and potential long-term effects. As with any RC, caution should be exercised. No deaths or hospitalizations have been reported due to it's usage so far (august 2013) there is no data for lasting negative physical effect.
> 
> AL-LAD is every bit as much as potent as it's sister molecule LSD and should be treated with equal respect. This chemical is a powerful psychedelic and the effects are mostly mental/visual. Most online reports have been positive with no complaints of negative physical effect after the experience has ran its course.
> 
> Bad trips are always possible with almost any psychedelic and AL-LAD is no exception, with reports mentioning things becoming much too intense and 'cartoon like' at higher dosages. Always make sure you know how much you are ingesting and do so in a safe environment where you feel comfortable. NEVER ingest a psychedelic if you will be working or driving.
> 
> There scarce data regarding the combination of AL-LAD and other substances. Combination with MAOIs (monoamine oxidase inhibitors) carries the same risk as with many other psychedelics, however since this combination has not been documented it can NOT be recommended at this point.
> 
> Dosages and consumption methods
> 
> 
> 
> AL-LAD is easily dissolved onto blotters or can be taken in suspension, held under the tongue or on the gum and cheek. Anecdotal reports mention this compound being active orally, unlike LSD itself. A mild dose can be as low as 80 micrograms, with a intermediate dosages around 150-200 micrograms. Higher dosages have been reported up to 300 and 400 micrograms.
> 
> History of usage
> 
> 
> 
> There is not a much credible data because of the scarcity of this compound, however Alexander Shulgin has written an extensive report of his own self experimentation in TIHKAL entry #1.

> SYNTHESIS: To a solution of 66 mg nor-LSD (see under ETH-LAD for its preparation) in 2 mL freshly distilled DMF under a nitrogen atmosphere, there was added 48 mg anhydrous K2CO3 and 30 mg allyl bromide. When TLC analysis indicated that the nor-LSD had been consumed (30 min) all volatiles were removed under a hard vacuum. The residue was solubilized in CHCl3 (5x5 mL) and the pooled extracts dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 which was remove by filtration. The filtrate removed under vacuum leving a residual white solid. This was separated into two components by centrifugal chromatography (alumina, CH2Cl2, nitrogen and ammonia atmosphere), the first of which was the major product. After removal of the solvent, this was dissolved in hot benzene, filtered and cooled. The addition of hexane prompted crystallization of AL-LAD (N-allyl-nor-LSD) as a white crystalline product weighing 66 mg, yield 88%. It had a mp of 88-90°C and an [a]D + 41.8 (c 0.44, EtOH).

> QUALITATIVE COMMENTS : (with 50 µg) "I am aware in twenty minutes, and am into a stoned place, not too LSD like, in another hour. I would very much like to push higher, but that is not in the cards today and I must acknowledge recovery by hour eight."
> 
> 
> 
> (with 80 µg) "I had a mild effect, although the doors to my repressed feelings somehow really become opened up. There was nothing transcendental here, but there were moments where I felt a conscious separation from the world about me. None of the profound meanings that I had hoped to have explained were explained." 
> 
> 
> 
> (with 150 µg) "I felt it in less than a quarter hour, and was shooting up past a +++ in another quarter hour. Fast. Just like LSD but without the vaguely sinister push. A little time slowing, randy, no body disturbance. Dropping at six hours and totally tired and going to sleep at twelve hours. I will repeat."
> 
> 
> 
> (with 150 µg) "Simply beautiful. Erotic and music absorption after second hour. Clear thinking with superb imagery and good interpretation. Easy, gentle sleeping. Next day -- serene, clear-thinking peacefulness. One of the best materials ever."
> 
> 
> 
> (with 160 µg) "I took 160 ug at 11 AM on an empty stomach and lay down to listen to a hypnotic relaxing tape, with eye shades and headphones. The onset was very gradual over two or three hours. There was some visual distortion similar to LSD, but mild. I decided that this was about as intense as it was going to get, so I lay down in the living room with the others. The experience continued to intensify over the next hour in intermittent waves. I had to verify that I was actually in a physical room rather than in the music I was hearing. There was never any fear or panic, but I chose to retreat to a private place for the next couple of hours. Soon I started to feel worse and I tried to gain some insight and relief from my negative attitude. I prayed, and I cried, and I began to feel calmer and had more positive thoughts as to how to deal with the others, but I was still afraid to go out into the group. I was afraid that my hopelessness would bother them but I eventually went back out at about the five hour point and the rest of the day was spent pleasantly and smoothly. I took 2.5 g of L-tryptophan to sleep, and I slept well, waking twice."
> 
> 
> 
> (with 160 µg) "I pretreated myself with 40 milligrams of inderal 40 minutes beforehand, took the AL-LAD, and went to bed with eye-shades and ear-phones. There was a very slow onset. The effects were best described as very short bursts of loss of contact with my body, which became increasingly intense and frequent as things progressed. It became really trippy, like acid. There were no visuals with my eyes closed, but when I removed my eye-shades the floors were melting, and the wall patterns and the wood ceiling really flowed. My body felt very blob-like, and I had to get help from my sitter to get up so I could pee. I was very affected by music. There was a very long down-ramp, with physical excitation appearing to linger longer than psychic excitation. Pretty much out of it by 12 hours and I felt well the next day."
> 
> 
> 
> (with 200 µg) "This was taken on the tail end (seventh hour) of an MDMA experience. I felt it quickly, but it never got to a super level. Complicated erotic, good talking, looked pretty stoned, and yet I still had cognitive integrity."
> 
> 
> 
> EXTENSIONS AND COMMENTARY: This is one of the several very potent compounds in a large series of 5-alkylated analogues of nor-LSD. Most of them proved to be less potent than LSD, and considerably less dramatic. The Inderal mentioned in one of the comments is a trade name for propranolol, an antihypertensive that reduces nervousness.

> > AL-LAD is an alkenated / alkylenated analogue of (6-nor-)LSD, or differently put a 'homologue' of LSD, that has a slightly lower potency in practice and somewhat shorter duration of effects than LSD although it showed higher potency in theory. It gained recognition after Alexander Shulgin described the substance in the book TIHKAL, although David Nichols and Albert Hofmann described AL-LAD 12 years before that in an article. However until recently AL-LAD has not been known to have been available on the market.
> > 
> > Because it is not an alkyl analogue it bypasses UK drug analogue laws. In this early stage of availability on the market AL-LAD is quickly gaining popularity, having a lot of the virtues of LSD and even advantages over it, although opinions and reactions always vary as per YMMV.
> > 
> > Until recently history of use in humans was quite limited, and positive reports do not guarantee physical safety. If it has remotely the therapeutic index LSD has it should be considered physically quite safe, but has not yet been proven, as far as I know.

> > 
> > Effects can be felt within a quarter hour to an hour or more. Physically the experience can include a warm body high, elevated heart rate and increased energy. Visually the effects are similar to that of LSD (depending on the individual). Users often report euphoria and music enhancement. Some users report a merge between audio and visual aspects of the experience.

> > 
> > AL-LAD is every bit as much as potent as it's sister molecule LSD and should be treated with equal respect. This chemical is a powerful psychedelic and the effects are mostly mental/visual. Most online reports have been positive with no complaints of negative physical effect after the experience has ran its course.
> > 
> > Bad trips are always possible with almost any psychedelic and AL-LAD is no exception, with reports mentioning things becoming much too intense and 'cartoon like' at higher dosages. Always make sure you know how much you are ingesting and do so in a safe environment where you feel comfortable. NEVER ingest a psychedelic if you will be working or driving.
> >

> > 
> > 
> > AL-LAD is easily dissolved onto blotters or can be taken in suspension, held under the tongue or on the gum and cheek. Anecdotal reports mention this compound being active orally, unlike LSD itself. A mild dose can be as low as 80 micrograms, with a intermediate dosages around 150-200 micrograms. Higher dosages have been reported up to 300 and 400 micrograms.

When TLC analysis indicated that the nor-LSD had been consumed (30 min) all volatiles were removed under a hard vacuum. The residue was solubilized in CHCl3 (5x5 mL) and the pooled extracts dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 which was remove by filtration. The filtrate removed under vacuum leving a residual white solid. This was separated into two components by centrifugal chromatography (alumina, CH2Cl2, nitrogen and ammonia atmosphere), the first of which was the major product. After removal of the solvent, this was dissolved in hot benzene, filtered and cooled. The addition of hexane prompted crystallization of AL-LAD (N-allyl-nor-LSD) as a white crystalline product weighing 66 mg, yield 88%. It had a mp of 88-90°C and an [a]D + 41.8 (c 0.44, EtOH).

> > (with 160 µg) "I took 160 ug at 11 AM on an empty stomach and lay down to listen to a hypnotic relaxing tape, with eye shades and headphones. The onset was very gradual over two or three hours. There was some visual distortion similar to LSD, but mild. I decided that this was about as intense as it was going to get, so I lay down in the living room with the others. The experience continued to intensify over the next hour in intermittent waves. I had to verify that I was actually in a physical room rather than in the music I was hearing. There was never any fear or panic, but I chose to retreat to a private place for the next couple of hours. Soon I started to feel worse and I tried to gain some insight and relief from my negative attitude. I prayed, and I cried, and I began to feel calmer and had more positive thoughts as to how to deal with the others, but I was still afraid to go out into the group. I was afraid that my hopelessness would bother them but I eventually went back out at about the five hour point and the rest of the day was spent pleasantly and smoothly. I took 2.5 g of L-tryptophan to sleep, and I slept well, waking twice."

The effects were best described as very short bursts of loss of contact with my body, which became increasingly intense and frequent as things progressed. It became really trippy, like acid. There were no visuals with my eyes closed, but when I removed my eye-shades the floors were melting, and the wall patterns and the wood ceiling really flowed. My body felt very blob-like, and I had to get help from my sitter to get up so I could pee. I was very affected by music. There was a very long down-ramp, with physical excitation appearing to linger longer than psychic excitation. Pretty much out of it by 12 hours and I felt well the next day."

Most of them proved to be less potent than LSD, and considerably less dramatic. The Inderal mentioned in one of the comments is a trade name for propranolol, an antihypertensive that reduces nervousness.
> > 
> > 
> > 
> > A comment is appropriate concerning the use of the prefix "nor," as in the name of this material N-allyl-nor-LSD and of its immediate precursor, nor-LSD. Its exact meaning is that there is an alkylated nitrogen atom somewhere that has lost an alkyl group. The original term is from the German phrase "N-ohne-Radical" meaning N (the nitrogen) without the radical (meaning the alkyl group). The removing of the N-methyl group of LSD to form the N-H counterpart is a text book example of this usage. Unfortunately its use has slopped over to embrace the removal of an alkyl group from a heteroatom of any sort. Recently I learned of a metabolite of ibogaine that has lost a methyl group from the indolic oxygen atom (a methoxy has become a hydroxy) and the compound was called noribogaine. The correct term, to retain the use of the parent ibogaine word in its name, would have been desmethyl ibogaine. The removal of something is usually indicated with a "de-" or a "des" prefix ahead of the item that has been lost, as in deoxy (or desoxy) ribonucleic acid, DNA, which is ribonucleic acid (RNA) missing an oxygen atom.

Very fucking deep stuff but I've been too afraid too explore it on larger doses (after my first bad experience with it).  What I love about Al-Lad is the pure positivity futuristic random images.  Everytime I just get this emptying of all badness and everything I think positively enter me and cleanses me.  Very damn weird.

Very fucking deep stuff but I've been too afraid too explore it on larger doses (after my first bad experience with it).  What I love about Al-Lad is the pure positivity futuristic random images.  Everytime I just get this emptying of all badness and everything I think positively enter me and cleanses me.  Very damn weird.

Shamanism,


you said that your MDMA usage wasn't causing any negative afterglow, how you worded this sounds like this dosage is right for you. you also mentioned that you expect different results from different chemicals and I think that this is absolutely justified. MDMA works totally differently than the common ergoloids and tryptamines. individual ergoloids and tryptamines also work differently than some of the other psychedelics in these two classes. you can't expect the same response from every chemical


in saying you might burn out if you combined excessive 4-ho-met and AL-LAD i am suggesting that with these two chemicals excessive doses could result in trouble integrating the experience. if you rock out over the line you'll know. if this happens all that your looking at is a few days of weirdness with the more balanced chemicals such as LSD (and probably something similar with 4-ho-met/AL-LAD). every chemical is different and every person has different body chemistry. some people have after effects lasting several weeks with the NBOMes

Why these two chemicals? AL-LAD is pretty easygoing, I don't see how adding it to another substance would make it more difficult to integrate the experience. If anything I'd expect the opposite, that making half your dose AL-LAD would make it more clearheaded and straightforward.

Responsible combinations have never proven to be any more taxing for me than individual psychedelics.  Of course if you go too far it will be, but if you lower the doses of each and combine things that are safe to combine (such as a 4-sub-T and an ergoloid), you shouldn't expect anything negative to come of it that couldn't come from just taking one or the other.

It will be there's still a huge supply but previously the vendors have nearly all been UK, it might take a second but more will pop up. I bet many of the old UK vendors sold off the rest of their stocks nearing the ban that was leftover....

I really hope so, as I dont have the funds to order more.


It seems some say the ban will likely make al lad dissapear, but other seems very positive about the fact that the demand is too big for it to go away.


was al lad manufactured in UK? if not, I dont understand why the ban would affect every country then.

Bitcoin itself is a legal payment method even if some sides or practices to it are or border on the dubious or illegal. Keep advice to one post redirecting to parts of the forum where there is bitcoin discussion (hey big tip..), or just a post. Or rather use a PM to explain.

What is against the rules is anything related to sourcing or acquiring drugs so certainly let's not dwell on enabling all you folks to buy illegal drugs. It's just not what the forum is for.

It made my night after puking my guts out from funky chicken.

 AL-LAD definately intensified everything, but in my mind it wasn't difficult just very relaxing and fun.


*I don't know if a bad trip happens to everybody and where you draw the line on bad or that with more experience you could steer it more. Perhaps not with every material, but I'm curious to how much you can do with refocussing on something else or see it as a good thing and dont fight it perhaps if it is personal trauma that emerges you need to deal with that sort of thing, sure people have bad trips but do very experienced trippers still get them?*


If you are having a really difficult trip you take a benzo, but in some more managable situations I could see 4-HO-MET as a softner, more mellow, makes you feel at peace, warm etc. I could see this material as someting that might ease and prevent difficult (but still managble trips), or mellow out substaces that are a bit analytical for the moment. Becase in this regard it definately relaxes you.

Perhaps even sub treshold or tresholddose of 4-HO-MET, could smoothen the roughnes of some materials.

shamanism, I don't think you can get down by going more up. 

if someone is in trouble because of too much psychedelic effect adding another psychedelic  will make the effect more intense. 

what you are hoping  is that the memory of the warm pleasant trip with come with the dose but that will not be the case.

the effect  will be additive though hard to measure and predict.


thousands of nightmare trips have occurred by trying to smooth a hard trip by smoking pot, 

 instead of smoothing the experience the troubled trippers end up finding that everything just got so much more intense.

Yes you are abolutely right there.


I'm sorry if my posts were too hypothetial in this context,  was more thinking along the lines of 'tofu' 2C-D and this binging the fun back in. But only at still magagable doses of the other substance. 


I'm not hoping for someting to happen in any way, I certainly wasn't hoping for a memory of a good trip to  emerge and bring someone 'back to life' after egodeath either.8)


I don't reccomend this to someone having an intense bad trip. But I would think if you were on a 150 AL-LAD trip and it might get 'difficult' and you're out of benzos or don't want to call it quits for the night than a low dose 4-HO-MET could could very well smoothen it out for you and get the fun back in.

I should have purchased more AL-LAD when I had the opportunity. I obtained only ten tabs via two purchases (same batch) and I have only four or five left. Ditto regarding LSZ, which is another jewel and in some ways better still. My crystal ball suggested that a potentially fine lysergamide "replacement" might see the light of day in the near future though. Let's see how that goes.

I took 300 ug a few days ago, with some tolerance (150 ug a week before). It was incredibly visual. Very complex fractals, this kind of stuff. Looking at paintings was astonishing. Coming up was a bit rough given the context (a crowded new years eve party) but everything quickly became hilarious. A friend of mine mixed it with 2c-c and he couldn't stop laughing the whole night. It was so visually intense for him that he couldn't use his phone any more. I have about 5 friends who tried al-lad, and each one of us simply love it. I hope it will remain available after the uk ban.

So after two mostly uninspiring trials of AL-LAD when out and about in unfamiliar environments, I found that I wasn't finding the level of introspective (or visual) interest that others have. First test was at 150ug, second was at about 225ug. I have a high lysergamide tolerance generally, so I suspected that had a part to play.


Both experiences left me feeling a little edgy, with a few visual distortions (breathing/shifting) but overall lacking in character. 


Before the ban came into action I made use of the remainder in my comfort-zone (my bedroom, with an array of choice re: music, comfort and entertainment). 


Dosed 300ug this time with another 150ug top-up one hour later (450ug total).


WOW.


Some diclazepam & pyrazolam dosed at the same time took the anxious edge off the first hour of the experience. By hour 4 I found myself sitting on my window sill, taking in the fresh night air, marvelling at the stars and listening never-more intently to Russell Brand quip about Ghandi, and Lawrence Krauss describe the nature of the cosmos. I laughed with inner glee - that unavoidable, self-prepetuating chuckle that lysergamides invoke - and reflected on the significance of their words. I cast my eyes around as the fullest range of colour and shapeliness of my surroundings offered itself to me. I fell in love again with what little my tiny ape-ish mind could see, hear and think. 


The darker edge of the lysergamide experience - the part that opens up less comfortable memories and thought patterns for scrutiny - didn't seem to interrupt the experience (though this is something I don't resist or fear, so perhaps I find those insights less troubling than some). The benzos certainly lent a blanket of comfort to the trip and I think I'd find the anxious 'edge' a little uncomfortable without them. I had no trouble drifting off to sleep aided by an extra Etizolam as the trip tailed off, though I was already quite tired. 


The following day I felt very tired but noticed no other unwelcome 'comedown-type' effects. 


After such an explosive final experience with it I join the many others here that will be sad to see it leave. All I can say is god bless and goodbye, 'our lad.'

I find it very hard to believe that available of this will end, people love it too much and it's gotten too widespread.


Governments should really let good, quality, relatively safe psychedelics like AL-LAD stay legal because illegalizing things just causes people to synthesize new, often much sketchier substances to replace them.  Their misguided attempts at prohibition only result in more harm (NBOMes are a great example, they should have just left the 2C-Xs alone and we wouldn't have a plethora of deaths and damage from new, dangerous substances made to replace them).  It's not like it will ever be possible to stop the production and availability of psychedelics, so illegalizing the good ones is just irresponsible of them.

I've begun to see something good that comes out of these bans. Without the previous rounds of bans, it's likely we never would have gotten this lovely AL-LAD. Illegalizing the good ones is tragic, but it does force "the industry" to find new turf, which inevitably turns up some dangerous ones like the NBOMes, but it also turns up some real gems, like AL-LAD. 


It make a pretty fun game too. A riveting, real life drama.

The industry didn't invent AL-LAD. There was already evidence it was a quality chemical. If all safe drugs were legal it still would have been synthesized.

No, I know very well that the industry didn't invent AL-LAD, but it certainly mass produced it and brought it to my mailbox. It's one thing for a chem to be synthed on small scales in reseach labs, it's another to bring it to the masses.


I think if all drugs were legal it wouldn't have been synthesized for the market, because they would just be making LSD instead. Look at it this way: we never heard of AL-LAD on the blackmarket before it made it onto the clearnet right? It's not like AL-LAD was unheard of by the labs producing LSD, it's just that there's no point in them synthing a new chem that is one step extra vs. LSD, is less potent, and they would have to convince people is worth trying.

You never read TIHKAL? And you honestly think no one would synth new or obscure drugs if they were all legal? I think that's just absurd, man. There would be plenty of demand and plenty of money to be made. People aren't buying these drugs just because they're legal. A lot of people like exploring new compounds.

Doldrugs: Shulgin definitely wasn't producing AL-LAD for the blackmarket. AL-LAD has been discovered since a long time ago, since the 70s or something, but you never ever would find it on the blackmarket (as in, available for purchase through clandestine channels), because there was no incentive for an underground lab to make it on a scale where it can reach the masses, so normal drug users just didn't have access to it. AL-LAD was not on the map for 99.9% of us until a year or two ago. 


Fast forward a few decades from the time AL-LAD was first produced in a research lab in Japan (apparently), to the UK in 2012 (or whenever it was) where virtually every tryptamine and phenethylamine has been banned, and suddenly there's an incentive for a lab to produce AL-LAD, and market it to the masses. And as a result this beautiful thing happened where suddenly anyone, almost anywhere on this planet, could trade a few bucks for an experience with this magical chemical.


I'm not saying the bans are good, just saying there's a silver lining to all this. The bans drive exploration by the market. If it weren't for the last round of bans in the UK we wouldn't be enjoying AL-LAD right now. I look forward to what the country with the cutting edge of the drug bans produces next.

Ehh people are always jumpy around bans. Who cares if the UK has banned it? The UK bans everything and we still have 99.9% of their banned chemicals anyway. IMO besides the newer AL-LAD vendors, most UK vendors are trash selling gross pellets and other stupid shit anyone with half a brain would care about....

I didn't say Shulgin produced it for the black market. But people definitely heard of it because of him. And if drugs were legal, I'm willing to bet the drug he called "one of the best materials ever" would have made it to market.

I don't think so - AL-LAD has been "known" and legal most places for at least 30 years, but it didn't show up until 2012. I think that the reason it showed up is because there was market for it, and the reason there was market for it was because a whole bunch of stuff was taken off the market from bans.


People love to blame the presence of NBOMes on the bans, I'm saying that by the same token we actually have some pretty good stuff too.

I think you're right that bans played a part in getting it out there, but I think legalization would have done the same. Nbomes didn't have a high profile positive review behind them. I think you're vastly underrating the market for novel compounds. 4-aco-dmt and 6-apb are legal most places and have been around forever. Why have any other additional compounds been made? Why aren't people just using the same chemicals?

Neither of those are UK legal. UK legal suppliers are just selling benzos, ethylphenidate, bk-2c-b & completely worthless shit now. There's a 'new improved' replacement for 5-meo-dalt on the way apparently. Novel compounds are produced for the UK market to replace what has been banned here.


I think if LSD was legal we might never have seen AL-LAD, since it's made from LSD, has a low yield & is less potent, it's much more expensive to produce than LSD. I don't know about you, but I'd much rather have LSD than AL-LAD & I wouldn't touch an nbome with your tongue.


Is 'spice' a big thing in US states that have legalised recreational marijuana? Who would smoke head shop blends that taste of perfume & make you foam at the mouth if they had a good selection of cheap legal weed?

I doubt it. Like I said were psychonauts and enjoy different realms of conciouness. Why would things be different if it were legal? When these chems were legal it's not like the only one available was LSD. Off the top of my head there was psilocybin, DOM, PCP, and etc.


Also even if MJ were legal id still smoke synth noids just like my explanation above there all different flavors. Though I don't partake in that spice garbage and never really have and IMO was a bad thing to attempt to compare and contrast.

A lot of compounds are never seen on the black market after they have been banned, because most people think they're not worth producing/selling/buying compared to drugs that were already illegal. There are a few exceptions. I don't see any dealers offering jwh-018 in the uk for example, despite it being the best synthetic, might as well just get some good weed. There are obviously a few drug nerds that get a kick out of trying novel substances, but most RCs are never going to be mass market.


I expect the rest of the last batch of al-lad has been sent to europe to be sold because it didn't sell out & there weren't heavy discounts on it, but I doubt there will be much more after that.

While 018 is grandness and is an old favorite I'd still take some of the newer series over it. Granted a combination of the two like some AB-FUBINACA and 018 would be godly....

Synthetic cannabinoids are all uniformly awful, so comparing them to AL-LAD doesn't make any sense. AL-LAD is a unique chemical with benefits over acid: shorter duration, more visuals, clearer headspace. It's not better than acid, but it's good and it's different enough to warrant use. The fact that the yield is less has nothing to do with anything; the price would reflect that.

Almost all synthetic cannabinoids have (relatively) novel structures unlike those of natural / classic cannabinoids like THC while AL-LAD is a very close analogue or even homologue of LSD. As far as RCs go, only small modifications to a molecule are less of a leap of faith for me like novel structures with unknown toxicologies.

Any reason why direct analogs of THC (or even better, CBD) haven't been explored by the RC community? Legality?

Finally got to try this great material a couple of weeks ago, was an experience that had almost no negatives aside from having to go back to normal life the next day with little sleep.


Sad to see it becoming less openly available with the UK ban. For what it's worth the stuff my friend and i had was laid on blotter with a picture, as opposed to the chemical symbol/name.


My friend had previously had the classic cream coloured symbol/name blotters several times and found them to be about twice as potent. 


Less potent is not an issue for me because i am not looking for completely immersive psychedelic experiences right now, but others may find this information useful, especially as the source advertised them at the same mcg amount (150) as the cream blotters, which seems to be inaccurate- whether deliberately or due to improper preparation.


Kind Regards

I would personally opt for structure / name printed blotter if possible, those seem to be laid professionally while with other blotter that is uncertain, especially considering it's harder to do at a smaller scale.


Me I am interested to hear what the new next lysergamide rc in line is, and I am not in the UK so will try to go for some AL-LAD still (I want a little bit of liquid, probably said that before, just seems nice). Hopefully LSD and AL-LAD are not *too* hard to match. Well surely there are a lot of possibilities, but remember they have to be very potent.

What is the tolerance build up with this like? Had 2 150ug tabs 4 days ago, and had 3 today. Feels much less intense today.


What's the best amount of time to wait between trips?

I agree, two weeks is fine, but I still had a great experience with 300 ug one week after a 150 ug trip. I remember seeing a table showing the decrease of LSD tolerance over time, but I can't find it anymore, I think it was on Bluelight but I'm not sure, could anyone help ? From what I remember, tripping again after 4 or 5 days is a waste of blotters.

Had a beautiful experience taking 200ug with a couple friends last night. It was their first time using psychedelics and they both said the trip was life changing. I had some intense OEVs staring at a painting and the mind fuck was almost at a perfect level. My only complaint was how short the trip was (after four hours and I significantly come down). Its too bad al-lad is strangely expensive, otherwise I'd stock up. Thinking about getting some 4-aco-met as an inexpensive substitute. 


**EDIT**: I also want to note that one of the people I tripped with is prescribed Citalopram (SSRI antidepressant, 40mg a day). In the last B&D people speculated that her experience with AL-LAD would be hindered because of it, but we all took the same dose and her trip seemed to be just as intense as myself and the third friend who are not taking any medications, and in fact she described tripping for almost an hour longer than I did. I instructed her not to take her medication on the day of the trip but she had been taking it regularly up until then. Guess we just got lucky!


Anyways, AL-LAD really needs a nickname- im sick of all my friends calling it "fake acid" or "lsd" just because ay-el el-ay-dee is too much of a pain to pronounce

My trips used to have a recurring theme of how i should stop tripping and using so much mdma. I didnt listen and a few weeks later got serotonin syndrome. Havnt touched anything except booze/benzos/kratom/alcohol since but now im feeling better im looking forward to a trip in the near future. Sorry getting off topic here.. so yeah.. AL-LAD!

Ah this as I if I haven't said it enough already, this is a fucking marvellous marvellous chemical :D  So glad it's still alive and well for the time being!


Editing this for a question but what does one say about combing a tab of LSZ with Al-LAd or even a half?  I did this last year at a psytrance festival but started with half al-lad, several MDMA pills, and LSZ way later in the night which was fucking incredible (although ultimate headache of doom after).  However, I know these timings are all over the place so how about the combo, minus MD of course, together at the same time?

I greatly enjoyed 150ug LSZ and 150ug AL-LAD together. The come up was terrible though. I only did it once, so I have no idea if the come up was an anomaly or a reproducible side effect of the combination. But it was an hour of dysphoria and uncomfortable body load. After the come up it was great, all side effects disappeared and it was an excellent experience.

AL-LAD can have quite a deep, intense headspace if you do enough. My last trip I was lost in a world of physical thoughts manifesting as maze-like collections of spirals in a void and I was jabbering nonsense for two hours straight. I thought I was the dying thoughts of an ancient alien civilization at one point. My thoughts were physical objects I sent into the void to fit into the helixes. It's certainly a much lighter headspace at lower doses while being surprisingly visual, but the potential is definitely there for powerful mind states.

Wow. Wow. Wow. I was going to pass on this because I thought it would be so similar to LSD. I am so glad I didn't.


I took 200 mics and even took 100 more in vain at 4 hours in because I was so sad to see the experience winding down.


This IS my new favorite compound for the time being - surpassing MDMA, psilocybin, LSD, N2O, etc.


Great Britain I feel your pain! Thankfully the rest of Europe continues to fight the good fight. I'm getting a sheet and hounding it for myself. Truly remarkable material.

I really enjoyed this experience it was really colerfull , bright , many visuals , everything tasted intenser , tracers , deep toughts. Going to do Al-Lad again with two friends of mine.

It won't be nearly as good if you do it 2 days in a row... I even did AL-LAD 3 days after I did it the first time and it was quite underwhelming.  I'm saving my next dose for maybe this weekend or something, it will have been a couple of weeks by then.

Holy fuck. Finally tried this stuff yesterday at 300mcg.


Absolutely incredible. Visuals were extremely strong. I can't imagine taking more than 450mcg of this stuff. The physical feeling is so gentle, I experiences zero nausea whatsover on the comeup. It is not pushy at all. Two hours after dosing it really started to go. This stuff takes a long time to kick in and peak. 


Walked to the convenience store in the middle of a blizzard and it was so fucking trippy. This stuff is the best. Glad i have 48 more hits of it.

I took 525ug of this the other night (3.5 hits).  It was a really fun trip, I was at my friend's house and took it at about 6:45pm, my other friends were going to take it too but didn't end up doing so so it was just me tripping but it didn't bother me at all, particularly since AL-LAD leaves me quite intact.  After a couple of hours I realized I had really intense visuals and I was in a great and humorous mood, similar to my last trip where I took 300ug and then 150ug an hour or so in.  This time the come-up was slightly awkward, whereas the last time it was absolutely effortless.  I ate dinner about 30 minutes after taking it, 15 minutes after I had swallowed the dissolved blotter paper. 


The visuals were really something.  I don't usually get much in the way of visuals anymore, surely due to my past abuse of psychedelics, but I was getting vivid, colorful tracers and everything was alive with brightly colored waves and fractals.  At one point I coughed really hard and for about 5 seconds afterwards, my vision was 100% overtaken with fractal mandalas.  It was DMT-level in complete saturation of my vision, I literally couldn't see anything but the fractals.  It faded pretty quickly, I think it was because of the rush of blood to my head/eyes from the coughing.


After dinner we hung out and then went to a psytrance show downtown.  At the show I had a total of 55mg of MXE in 3 doses, and then a couple of hours in I went for it and also had 20mg of 4-HO-MET, because for some odd reason I felt the AL-LAD way less at the show.  As soon as I stepped into the dark, blacklight-lit room, the visuals went away completely.  I still felt great, and the MXE eventually crept in and really disinhibited me a lot, and I got into the dancing and the music a lot more.  I ran into a new friend unexpectedly there and that was cool, no troubles socializing at all (humorously, he had taken 3.5 hits of LSD for the show).  I also had 3 beers over the course of about 4 hours.  When the 4-HO-MET kicked in, it didn't make a huge difference (20mg isn't a very high dose of it for me, I seem to have an unusually large tolerance to both lysergamides and 4-HO-MET - but not all 4-sub-tryptamines), but it did enhance the flowy, merging elements of the MXE.


I had a lot of fun that night, and afterwards we hung out at my friend's house for maybe an hour and a half and ate some pie and laughed a lot.  They had taken MXE and 2 of my friends also took 2C-B.  We smoked a few bowls and had ridiculous conversations in which we found great humor in analyzing.  We talked about cat and dog pee a lot for some reason (we all have pets), and then giggled relentlessly about the fact that we had been talking about it for so long.  By the time we wanted to sleep (4am), I was fine to drive home.  The visuals never returned after they disappeared at the show, but I remained in that great state of mind all night; though somewhat modified by other things, the AL-LAD bliss remained there at the base of everything.


One thing I noticed that was less than perfectly pleasant was that I had this weird gas pressure in me.  I got unusually full from dinner (I ate less than I usually do by a good bit), and once I started tripping, I started feeling what felt like uncomfortable bubbles of gas in my body.  They were in my stomach but it seemed like they were traveling up into other parts of my body too.  I'd feel sharp pain points if I leaned too far on my side, for example, and I could squish these pain points around as if they were bubbles of gas.  I also noticed that when I walked around a lot, I felt a strange burning inside my upper legs and pelvic area, which I was interpreting as some strange form of vasoconstriction.  It was an unsettling feeling, and the gas was annoying.  But when I went out and got to the show, both the gas and the burning suddenly disappeared, never to be seen again.


Overall I still think AL-LAD is a real gem. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  It's not deep, at least it hasn't been for me so far, but it puts me in a wonderful mood and state of mind, it feels good, and the visuals are beautiful.  It leaves me feeling great the next day too.

My glowing experience with AL-LAD was 200 mcg with 100 mcg redose in vain. I had taken 5 mg 4-aco-met the day prior and that did not seem to affect the trip in a negative way. I took 350 mcg 3 days later in again in vain. It has been 8 days since that and I only have 150 remaining and would like to possibly dose today. I think 150 should be enough for a full experience, but can someone with more experience speculate on whether 8 days is enough time for that tolerance to subside?

I don't even know if I would call it tripping, more like enhanced reality. 150 mcg was splendid. I hit the sauna, played basketball,  and ended up in my bed masturbating to 'Lifestyle' by Young Thug. Don't judge ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

Looking at a couple of years of storage, I don't think that putting it in solution would be a good idea, because degradation occurs much more readily.


I don't think that any credible evidence was brought forward that would give reason to suspect that the tabs are not dosed at 150ug. Hence, does it really matter if you buy 10mg of crystal vs. 10mg worth of tabs? Of course it does - the crystal is a headache to handle, unless you plan  to use it all within a short span of time, which it sounds like you don't.

I bought 23 tabs mid August 2014 and I now have 17. That's 900 micrograms in 5.5 months. My most common dose would average out at 0.25 tabs and the most I have taken is 0.75 tabs at once. I'm a big fan of low dosing psychedelics. I like the mild body buzz and listening to music, hiking, having some drinks with friends or playing guitar on my doses. I would say I haven't had any negative side effects.

about 6 months of every weekend either 2x 1/2 blotter or 2x 1 blotter, sometimes mixing lsz and al lad

it's a bit excessive maybe.


this weekend did 1/2 on saturday and 1 tab of DOC on sunday which was astonishing, though I like Al Lad and Lsz better than DOC it's up there

I thought I would check this thread tonight to see if anyone was talking about this.

I am pretty sure the blotters I had lastnight were dosed a fair bit higher than 150ug. I've done al-lad at least 10 times at doses between 150-450ug and lastnight I took what I thought was 225ug and it was a +450ug experience.

Until lastnight i thought al-lad was a playful tame psych with good visuals, I have since learnt of its reality melting, ticket to the selfless rainbow vortex effects.

Hold on - is this generally accepted as true?  I always thought that exposure to oxygen degrades lsd faster, and thus having it in solution or gel tabs/pill/microdot was the best form for long-term storage. (The acception being tap water, whose chlorine is definitely detrimental).  I remember reading somewhere that Owsley said that blotters were not an appropriate long term storage form (then again, he thought broccoli gave him cancer)

Pills / microdots basically contain tiny chunks of dry crystal, with the added benefit of shielding them from the direct environment by the fillers.


Gel tabs should also be fine, the dryer they are the better - undried gel still contains water which can ionize the drug making it more susceptible to degradation.


Blotters are just another matrix for dry solid material, just not as protective as pills probably. The only reason I can think of why blotters would not be ideal is that there is some form of intermolecular interaction, like H-bonds or vanderwaals forces, that are different from the ones in pure crystal. I doubt it is an issue, and it is probably a LOT less important than your other storage conditions i.e. amber glass or other UV-shielding, inert anhydrous gas, and protection against temperature fluctuations which may actually be the ones doing most harm, rather than elevated temperatures themselves.

yeah! at one point, I was sure I would never come back to reality.  I couldnt imagine me coming back sober and living my life, going around, after this kind of experience. the visual were very strong, like I couldnt see parts of my room only if I wanted to concentrate on it, patterns were everywhere.

the connection I felt between me and my surrounding was beyond seeing it with my normal eye, but with my whole being. At one point, Ive seen very alien stuff, the source?, kind of scanning me. I was a bit nervous during the peak and my GF began worrying for me as I couldnt make a normal sentence anymore, my heart was beating very fast: my girlfriend told me she was seeing my heart beating out of my chest and my jugular veins poppin out. that was during the alien stuff scanning me and all that kind of crazy stuff. I think I was on the verge of breakthrough of some sort. I was really feeling as if I was gonna die. then my grilfriend shook me and saying me: hello, hello, wake up. I was gone! I didnt knew what I was and why I could normally see reality as I do in sober life. The connection between me and the world was complete and the difference I normally make about it was totally destroyed and I saw the fallacy of me. I was looking at the beauty of my girlfriend, all the swirling, I could look at every pigment of her facial duvet swirling. her face at some point was covered with circular points 


there's no point trying to describe what I saw and felt, its impossible, but after reading people taking 450ug and saying thats where the fun begins, I thought 225 would be a walk in the park. wrong!

MY life has been change, the profound realization that any detrimental thoughts, judgments, we have about anything in the world are really detrimental for me and even more important, how all those judgments are false as we dont see reality as it is. I understood love and peace in really tactile way and how that is the only thing we can feel that is beneficial for us and others. I could see so clearly our responsibility for the whole world. crazy stuff.

^Wonderful. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  I have yet to experience anything profound on AL-LAD... well I've seen profoundly weird things happen that were shared by the others in my group, and experienced moments of intense synchronistic hilarity, but nothing spiritual.

people differ  in  the meaning or intent of the word "spiritual"

but it does render one "appreciative"

even in hilarity 

which is way better than gloominess

(and probably more spiritual too)

Good point - to clarify, I meant I have not seen any hint of the connection to the universe or the oneness so far in AL-LAD.  It was deeply therapeutic however, because I hadn't laughed or appreciated the small things like that since I was a kid.

Hello everyone,


I have a question for AL-LAD. I plan to take a quarter of blotter of a new batch (150µg). I'm wondering if it's OK to wait 1 hour after ingesting the quarter of blotter to redrop the remaining? 


Is 1 hour OK or too late?


Also, how long AL-LAD last again? And finally, is this chemical speedy or not? Bodyload is OK?


Thank you :D

Id say, in my VERY limited experience.

1h starts to feel really good, light as feather, transparent, laughing a lot, music amazing, ect

2h to 5h peak

then gradual comedown and back to almost baseline after 7-8

After an hour you will increase the effects but it won't be nearly as much as if you took it all at once.  IMO, 37.5ug (a quarter of a 150ug blotter) will be threshold or even not noticeable at all.


I find it energizing in the same way as LSD but not speedy.  I experienced absolutely no bodyload of any kind even at 450ug, not even a come-up really, I just started feeling good and kept feeling better.  It's really perhaps the friendliest psychedelic I have ever taken.  I applaud your caution but I think a quarter of a blotter is definitely too little.  If you don't want to take it all at once, I'd take half, and then add the other half.  But again it won't be as strong as if you took it all at once.

I decided to take a quarter for harm reduction because I'm gonna drop it in a friend house but with a lot of people, we're celebrating 3 birthdays. I think I'm still gonna take a quarter, wait an hour and redrop the remaining quarter. Just want to be safe.


Next time i'll do an half at once.. I want to go progressive on the dosing.


Thanks again ! ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

quarters worked with most lsd I have had but not with this.

I can feel 1/6, but it's just on the very fringe of what I can perceive. 1/4 is pretty low too, but more perceptible. I've never done 1/2 but I reckon pupnik is right about that being a good entry point, or maybe 1/3.

Sure why not! Keep in mind that al-lad seems to have a very slow onset. For me LSD takes about 20 minutes to begin, al-lad is more like 1-2 hours. So if you take quarters every hour it might really drag that onset out, which could be fine.


Spacing the dose out like this will surely diminish the effects to some extent, but I think it will be a great experiment. Let us know how it goes if you do go that route.


I'd probably take 1/4 or 1/3 every 30-45 minutes to condense it a bit, but I'd love to hear how 1/4 every hour goes.

I would advise against taking a quarter tab then another quarter tab then another quarter tab. You will get effects, which are positive, but you will not get the psych experience from something that low.


My first time trying it was camping with a group of friends and I started with 1/3rd tab then increased incrementally through the night to 1.5 tabs total. I never got any visuals and the effects were more of a focused happy stoney headspace. It was fun but I was left wanting more.


I have taken a 1/2 tab many times and I was able to remain completely functional and social (I wouldn't do it when you have responsibilities but at a party or something it should be fine).

i agree, for me just 1 150ug tab isnt enough. u will trip.... but like i said i dont have time for half steppin' lol my 300ug al lad trip was kinda intense, just confusing and a headache , NOTHING crazy u wont freak out taking 2 or lose yourself. personally id suggest 1.5 al lad blotts for first time experienced users.... 1 would leave me wanting more. bc @ 300ug it wasnt too crazy i felt like if i took less i would have def been disapointed @ 300ug i WAS disapointed ONLY with the visuals everything else was great, i expected insane visuals from 300ug  at least the same as 150ug-200ug lsd level, there were visuals but not the kind im really looking for. i like intricate pea style visuals with patterns . i heard a guy here describe the visuals perfectly. swaying/breathing walls/carpet and everything looked like i was watching a 3d movie w/o the glasses. there was that light rainbow aroa on everything but wasnt real pronounced and would go away when looking hard. nothing wow ing, disapointing to me and even low dose lsd trips r visually exciting for me but that being said even though i felt i wanted more visuals from al lad i wouldnt take more than 300ug bc i think it would be to intense/confusing for me and i wouldnt take less so its just ok to me, its only not a 5/5 bc its not as visual as id like and to achieve the visuals i like i would have to take to much , more than 300ug is my max with this .... but still not ego loss or anything..

Day 1 - 10mg of 5-meo-mipt without tolerance: strong enough trip for the situation (day at the beach with the family). I still didint get what people refer to as "MDMA-like high". Little to no visuals


Day 2 - no drugs


Day 3 -  approx 180ug of AL-LAD was enough for a very nice day at the beach! Colours enhanced, light trails. Giggling like a stoner.. This was much better than 5-meo-mipt.


Day 4 - i upped the doses to make up for tolerance. Before going to the beach (again), I Took 300 ug of AL-lad and, one hour later, 10mg of 5-meo-mipt. 

These two drugs mixed well! I expected to be a little bit higher than the daybefore but I got MUCH higer than that..

 Visuals were pretty strong: colours were vivid, trails were everywhere, everything was sparkly and full of life. This day i thought the beach was much more stunningly beautiful. Some times I doubted my vision, I thought I saw fish in the water but I am still not sure if I was hallucinating. 

At some moments I felt it was a little bit too much for a day with the family. I started to notice how my parents and my uncles are aging. I remembered how they were when young and felt a certain sadness for them. This lead me to contemplate the ephemerality of our human existence and the iminence of death. how insignificant our life is compared to the universe, and how I am some times wasting my brief existence with futile things.

My mother is still only 53, but this image of my old mom and her similarities with my grandma is still stuck to my head.


Anyways, i thought this little TR would be good to show that my body did not grow too much tolerance with this drug regimen. I have never taken 300ug without tolerance, but it was certainly much stronger than 150ug.

I took one tab of 150ug the other day. My first impression is that this is not acid. It is not bad, it is definitely a psychedelic, fairly visual, but I felt none of the electricity that I feel from acid. The direct connection to your emotions and nerve centers that lsd, for me at least has. At this dosage I noticed a distinct lack of physical involvement, with the exceptions of a mild analgesic effect, and some jaw tightening. Next time I try it, I will have to increase the dosage and see where that leads. I could see this being a good combination with the 4-X series of tryptamines. I also found that it combines really nicely with some good sativa.

I usually don't mix RCs because I already got unexpected results with some experiments, but in this case, the effect of the AL-LAD was very gentle/light and we wanted to extend the experience by turning it into something different and darker.


Some months ago I've tried the following combo with very good results (I was taking psychedelics -mostly/at least- once per week, so I had a pretty good tolerance):


* +00:00 oral 150ug AL-LAD

* +03:00 oral 60mg MDMA 

* +04:30 oral 16mg 4-AcO-DMT


It was *pretty* intense and good, no detectable body load, specially the change from the residual effects from the AL-LAD to the 4-AcO-DMT. It could be described like "from something happy, silly to the profound darkness". The change can be pretty dramatical for unexperienced users (one of 4 of us got a bit scared), but I personally enjoyed it a lot. Most probably, suppressing the MDMA and taking the 4-AcO-DMT before it's going to be better.

Cool, I just made some small amount of AL-LAD (2.5 mg) into liquid allacid in a tiny dropper bottle using 96%. I don't trip frequently these days so I don't want to store much in solution.


Didn't use latex gloves so hopefully (or not hopefully?) I didn't pull a Hofmann ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)


Maybe it's pointless but I always wanted to have / try liquid acid... In any case it is good to feel that I have my 0.1 mg scale for a reason!

I am planning to try this substance before diving into the real LSD. I think the shorter duration will be a great introduction to lysergamides. Even though, I have tried LSD once, but it was a rather mild dose combined with something else. Looking forward to a profound psychedelic experience.

I tried al-lad + lsz and it was way too much body load. Surprisingly, mdma+mda+al-lad+weed is not a lot of body load.

I took 300ug last night. I hadn't taken AL-LAD since last summer and I was eager to revisit it. I even had a dream about it the night before last. The trip was wonderful, as always, even if the peak was a bit shorter-lived than usual. The plateau was its expected length, though. One of the many things that I love about this compound is the ultra-smooth onset and drop. AL-LAD is really clean on the body!

I have only tried AlLAD one time and it was 300mcs. 

Kept saying to my gf the entire trip how 'clean' it felt on the body, Amazing stuff


Way better than L in my opinion. ALLAD doesnt fuck with my stomach.

With 300 ug taken orally Saturday night, I had an amazing experience. Clean, euphoric, and slightly stimulating body buzz. No negative physical side effects whatsoever, aside from sweaty palms, but hey I didn't care! Duration of 8-9 hours before I could sleep.


It's been a while since I've taken LSD, but this certainly renewes my absolute love of legitimate lysergimides. Crystal clear beautiful fractal visuals. Very geometric for me. After the peak, visuals settled into a pale green aura, almost like my dark room was covered in the light of neon green colored blacklights. 


This is the type of stuff you take if you want to just sit for hours in sheer bliss, merely contemplating the beauty of life. Love it. Certainly could be a situation "enhancer", as mental effects aren't too strong even at this dose for me, YMMV. I believe in higher dose it could be a more introverted trip, though I have tried it at 450 ug, with similar results, maybe a little more body load with 450 Ug.

If you're used to acid would definitely try more than 150ug, I find one tab doesn't get me far enough and prefer 225-300ug region. I don't see any purpose in pushing AL-LAD into much higher doses as I would rather take acid or another psychedelic. It definitely is lighter but has that signature lysergamide feeling. I find it doesn't carry the same energetic push though similar to what you're saying that I find with acid really speeds up my associations with context of things/thoughts which is one of my favorite things about acid.

Is there any reason to low-dose this? I'm new to this compound, but I've got a couple decades of lsd use under me belt lol! I usually allergy test any new compound, but if I'm comfortable with lucy should I dive in at a full dosage(150mcg)?

If you're sure what you have is al-lad, that it's really 150ug, and you have lots of experience with lsd, I think you'll be absolutely fine at 150ug. I still did a test of about 1/16 a tab at first just in case though.

Tried 300 ug of Al-LAD yesterday, the conclusion that I arrive at is: That she is pretty, but not too deep. At this dosage for me, it reminded me of the start of a good acid trip but never really took off. I had lots of visuals happening, but otherwise felt disengaged from the experience. I even took ~15mg of 4-ACO-DMT about half way in to fill out the experience, which helped connect a bit more, although I believe I had already hit tolerance at that point, so not a lot of effect from it. I believe I will get some 1P-LSD and see what that has to offer next. It should be noted that I have had decades of LSD experience, so the comparison is inevitable for me to make between the two.

I just had another glowing experience with Al-LAD and some ethanol. 


I went to a big electronic show with my friends  and since I am going to Coachella in a few weeks, I wanted to save my serotonin. I popped 150ug and had about 7 beers throughout the night and had the time of my life. The Al-Lad never made me too cloudy (I felt that I was far more lucid than my friends who took decent doses of mdma) but allowed me to really enjoy the music and the lights.

AL-LAD is so great.  I took 300ug of Al-LAD and 1 strong hit of LSD recently... it combined perfectly, just as I expected it to.  It basically resulted in the best parts of both drugs; lots of psychedelia, mental stimulation, euphoria, visuals, and sociability.  Pretty much perfect. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I took my first whack at this chem on Sunday. Wow. Nice. Gentle. Like DOC with a little more body buzz and slightly less visuals at one 150ug tab. Shorter duration, obviously and I was able to bai after 8-9 hours with ease. Afterglow was, and still is a little, (that might be the 4-fa I took this morning) persisting and beautiful. Might have to get a sheet for long term storage. Overall this is definitely top three alongside DOC and 4-x-met

I don't know, it was a pretty good hit.  No one really knows how many ug of LSD they have unless they lab test their tabs.  I'd guess maybe 80ug.  Just a guess though.

> 			Tried 300 ug of Al-LAD yesterday, the conclusion that I arrive at is: That she is pretty, but not too deep. At this dosage for me, it reminded me of the start of a good acid trip but never really took off. I had lots of visuals happening, but otherwise felt disengaged from the experience. I even took ~15mg of 4-ACO-DMT about half way in to fill out the experience, which helped connect a bit more, although I believe I had already hit tolerance at that point, so not a lot of effect from it. I believe I will get some 1P-LSD and see what that has to offer next. It should be noted that I have had decades of LSD experience, so the comparison is inevitable for me to make between the two.

I took 200 ug last night... It has "Almost" everything LSD has but lacks the ability to enhance feelings, emotion, Deep thoughts etc.  I was seeing the visuals but my body was without the euphoria and no mind fuck so to speak...  Music was amazing though... 


So in two weeks i'm going to try out 1p at 200 ug... If it is anything like i read earlier like the 60's & 70's which i'm very familiar with, I will be mused.. hopefuly

I get a tremendous level of body and mind euphoria from AL-LAD, physically it feels almost empathogen-like for me.  It greatly enhances my sense of humor and makes everything seem so funny.  But I agree it mostly lacks in deep thoughts, at least at the doses I've taken it at.  I can imagine you could get there with it sometimes.

AL-LAD definitely can be very mentally strong but it does take higher doses.

It's still available. But yeah...it's certainly more difficult to get. I have some from 2013 that's been in storage and working just fine. Just went to a show two weeks ago and did 450ug with splendid results. It's a beautiful substance. I have a bunch of 1p-lsd that's on tap for some time soon...


And as far as head-fuckiness is concerned, at higher ug's I find AL-LAD rather so. Not as deep as other psychs, but I think it really shines at +300 ug doses. I didn't even really appreciate it at lower doses. Just reminded me of under-dosing the "L". Same with LSZ. I didn't even enjoy it until I exceeded 300 mics, but I am a hard-head like that.

I brought a bunch and shared it with my psychedelic naive friends at Coachella last weekend - they were utterly blown away by how fun and foregiving it is for a huge festival.


A few even said they would take this over MDMA - which, at this stage in my drug career, I agree.


Absolutely amazing substance.

Hey everyone I'm sorry, I am very new to these forums and am not sure what the etiquette is for these things but I was wondering if anyone could help me out, I just had some al-lad arrive in an envelope that was cut open... The post office people said it just could have gotten caught in the letter sorting machine but it seems kind of suspicious. I am afraid to research this chemical for fear of it being tampered with... And I'm not sure how to add photos to my posts :/ but I took a couple that really show what it looks like, it looks like the left side of the envelope has a poriferated verticle line and that side of the envelope has been torn off... Inside theres a piece of paper and a plastic ziploc containing the chem with "AL 10" written on it and its all there. I guess what I'm trying to ask is, do you guys think it was tampered with?

I worked at the Un- deliverable unit in the USPS mail... It is true what they told you... Letters do get damage all the time... don't worry about it. If they seen what it was.. they would have turned it over the the postal inspectors... You would have been approached the day of delivery.. Our job is to reseal it and stamp it damage... 


If it came (letter) from another country, then customs would have busted you already... But they are not looking at letter.s.. mostly boxes.. and they have dogs to detect things... LSD and the like are not looked for...

It's common knowledge that sniffing pretty much any drug will make it work faster than oral. I don't think I need a source for that.

No it's not. Plenty of drugs don't work well if you snort them. And acting faster isn't the same thing as acting better.  


AL-LAD is so potent and fast acting... again, why go through the trouble?

Has anyone had any of the most recent AL-LAD from the UK-Polish-Canadian vendor. I just received mine and it looks the same except it wasn't vaccum sealed or whatever that plastic was that you had to cut off.  It was a 25 hit sheet folded in half in the bag. I'm sure it is legit, just was wondering if anyone else has gotten any recently.

I received some about a month ago, ordered a month before it arrived. It was securely vacuum sealed and labeled. It was flat, also a 25 hit sheet. 


On a related note, I ended up going for the two, 150 ug hits. It was quite a bit stronger than I expected. I'm thinking a tab and a half might be my butter zone. The body load was a bit much, lots of leg tension. Confusion was also present but to a lesser degree than the leg tension. Overall, I think I need a few more trials if I want to go this high or higher again. Great material though!

I don't think that's true. It supposedly depends on wether it's water or fat soluble, maybe some one else can expound since I'm on my way out. For instance, it's pointless to snort most benzo's, if I recall correctly.


Anyway, LSD has an awesome oral BA, no reason to take it any other way. and there's no reason to think AL-LAD should be any different.


I heard about in the eye, but I never heard about any one botherinng to snort it.

Yeah LSD has near 100% bioavailability orally, there's really no reason to take it any other way.  I would assume AL-LAD is the same.

I am going to Bay to Breakers (It is a 10km foot race that is followed by 100,000 drunk people in crazy costumes partying down the course). As it falls on my birthday every year I usually take MDMA and drink to celebrate. This year, I am very close to being done with MDMA for good so I am considering taking 150ug of the Lad instead. 


We do not run the race, rather we slowly drink our way down and stop about half way through the course at Golden Gate Park to participate in the massive party and people watch.  


Anyone have any comments about this plan? I have gone to raves and danced my ass off on only lad and booze so I do not think walking a few miles whilst under the influence will be a problem. 


Also, my GF took 75ug for the first time at Coachella and absolutely LOVED it. She is pretty inexperienced when it comes to psychs but LAD is her new all time favorite drug. Do you think a jump to 150ug would be too much for an event like this?

Me and my friends find AL-LAD to be a great drug for hiking and outdoor adventures that involve physicality, so I bet it would be great for your purpose too.  It's so friendly and warm and non-anxiogenic, and while it's not specifically stimulating like LSD, it certainly doesn't impede your ability to do physical activity.  I also find alcohol to mix well with it, though I wouldn't want to get full-on drunk personally just because it would probably blot out some of the effects you're looking for.  Well, until the main trip is over anyway, then getting drunk is something I would consider doing (and have done).

Exactly, I actually prefer AL-LAD to MDMA these days. I get the fun adventurous energy blast from it like MDMA but is I do not feel nearly as mongy or no do I fiend for a redose.  I also feel fine when AL-LAD wears off. 


I am definitely going to take 150ug with my backpack full of cold beer and a few joints. I love how well it mixes with ethanol. Too much booze on MDMA and I become a sloppy mess.

I think that's a good plan. AL-LAD has become my favored substance for concerts. 150ug leaves me functional but definitely altered and the shorter duration compared to LSD is pretty convenient.

^my doses can't be used as an example because I am dependent on benzos. I took 600ugs of LAD, 60mgs of 4-ho met and ~150 of mxe but remember benzos dull psychedelics so I have to compensate a bit.

I would be very surprised if liquid ALLAD in the nose was NOT faster than eating blotter. I have a lot of experience and liquid L in the nose is the best way to take it by far. It kicks in within five minutes.

I could understand it if it was a DOx we were talking about, but LSD already has a pretty fast and smooth onset imo. Yes, there's no reason to think AL-LAD is different than LSD in its bioavailability, but it is still  true that it can sometimes have a longer drawn out onset, so I guess I see the point there. 


I don't think I'd bother personally though, it's not like you're wasting material by taking it orally.

You might lose material in the process of making nose drops, though, for a negligible reward.

I haven't tried the combo myself, but I'd like to and I've noticed a few posts from people who have. It seems to be a winner!


To start out I'd try 100µg AL-LAD with a half tab of LSD, dropped at the same time. The reason I think simultaneous dropping is best is because the AL-LAD has a slower onset, so it should offset the two peaks a bit, which I think is more interesting that trying to line them up. And the whole thing should wrap up in the LSD length of time.


If you wanted to try to line up the peaks, probably drop the LSD about 45 mins after the AL-LAD.

Tried AL-LAD again - fantastic - I enjoyed how it opened up a whole different level of beauty and profundity to LSD and has a very different style all round. It isn't as clear headed as LSD - I found it less easy to socialise and chat on the comedown. It is generally more gentle and domesticated and a bit more plain fun than LSD but it is wrong to think it can't open you up to some  very deep states because of this. The auditory was astonishing.

Losing the ability to identify common things like numbers is always a funny part of tripping. I remember once at a low dose of LAD I had to stop playing poker with my friends because I had to keep asking someone "what number is this?" on the cards!

Just for the record, I've had a bunch of AL-LAD that I bought in 2013, exactly two years ago. I've been faithful in storing it, and for those wondering how it would fare, if stored properly, let's just say very well. I took 450 mics the other night and I don't think it has lost any potency at all. It was quite a night. And, I had a slight bit of tolerance, perhaps, from a 400 mic experience with 1p-LSD 5 days previous. Just reporting back for those that may be curious about its stability. In other words...it's pretty damn stable up to this point, which makes me happy since I have about 50 more tabs of it. I also have about 50 of LSZ which I also got around the same time, and I'll test fire that in the coming months. Same storage methods, same vendor, and I know it was good when I put it where it as in 2013. Also, I really dug the 1p LSD, althought that shit lasts a LONG time. In fact, I took it at 4 pm and even at 3 am, I was having light visuals and some stimmy effects. Only with 30 mgs of Valium did I get to sleep about 5 am the following day. Felt great the next day though! If possible, I'll grab a sheet of the 1p for good measure... ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

The term "proper", when it comes to lysergamides can be extremely subjective, given that some people will store them in airtight containers in a cool, dark place, and consider this "proper" storage. While others will store it them in freezers with certain gases to totally make sure no degradation occurs and consider that "proper". Care to elaborate?

Ha! It's funny a'cuz I've had a tab and a half 'on deck' for about a month and a half. Last night, I was antsy for a trip, but really wanted a body buzz. I decided to pop the half tab (75ug), and see where it got me. Well an hour later grocery shopping with my wife, I finally felt something (probably because I remembered it). It was that DMZ of intoxication, the middle ground; I was unsatisfied and muddied the waters with 50 mg of so-so cocaine and 15mgs oxycontin. Had a gin and limeade with dinner which I wasn't really hungry for. 

Followed by coitus (no issues with functionality, just a little numb, outlying goal).But my point or discovery was that my horribly improperly stored for a month plus al-lad was as potent as I would expect my properly stored stuff. I however am kind of tired of half dosing trying to make substances last. I'm not saying I'll overboard, but no more pussy footing. Also, I took a zolpidem to help me sleep which it did not.

*It makes me glad I have both LSZ and AL-LAD in storage. I bought 100 of AL and 50 of LSZ a year ago after trying a smaller quantity. I still have about 80+ al and 45 LSZ in amber vials, with a dessicant and O2 absorbers for overkill, even though I open and re-purge the gas-tight container with Argon every couple of months. And for the record, they have held up well. A couple of weeks ago I popped 300 of AL and got slammed pretty hard. I also did 300, then 450 of the LSZ several months ago, and they were totally active, with no seeming loss of potency. I have had them stored this way from the day I took them out of the vaccumed mylar, and seems to be working out well. And just as an FYI, I have gotten MUCH better results with higher doses of LSZ. 150 was to weak, 300 really nice, and 450 very similar to the mother compound. I also found out that doing LSZ seems WAY better while outside or at a concert venue. The inside just seems "off" for some reason. AL, however, is really my new favorites psych, having been a huge lover and consumer of LSD, which is hard for me to get now. Used to be easy, but I just don't have the hook-ups at my age.*

So I've finally researched this a number of times with dosages ranging from allergy-test on up to 300 mcg. So far, I agree with most experiences regarding clear-headedness and gentleness, but there's no way it's more visual than LSD - at least up to 300mcg for me, ymmv. I still plan on either a 450-600mcg dose whenever time will allow. As far as the visuals, I thought they were a little unique in that I experienced ribbons of color/light kind of shooting across my field of vision. And I didn't get much in the way of stimulation, maybe some minor stimulation - and I'm very sensitive to stims. One other thing is that I experienced a nice internal tryptamine vibration torwards the end of the trip - very nice stuff, can't wait to combo this with some quality L or ETH-LAD!!

I took 225µg of AL-LAD 3 hours ago and I feel nothing ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)


I ate some food 4 hours ago and took 1.5mg Pyrazolam at 4PM today.


Do you think the Pyrazolam dull the trip completely because it have a long half life ?


I'm very disappointed !

That's possible, Kishka, but I've noticed that you've been tripping too frequently these last few months. You might have developed significant tolerance; the benzos won't help either. I suggest that you take a break for at least one month.

Second experiment, with 6 months of no hallucinogens to completely reset tolerance...


300mcg. Oral, not sublingual.

26 year old male

Very experienced psych user (hundreds of shrooms and L trips)


Exact same reaction as my first time. My body loves this stuff, it comes on so gentle and light. After 30 minutes, I felt a light sensation feeling in my chest and throughout my body. It barely grows, but the visuals get fast starting around an hour. This stuff takes time to get going, literally an hour it really starts. Some things I noted during the trip... this trip was definitely weaker and slightly less visual than my first experiment. I blame the food I had in my stomach. The first experiment (same dose, 300) was consumed on an empty stomach with a clean GI tract, right in the morning. The visuals were AWESOME. This time the visuals were slower to get going an didn't really hit the movement level that they did the first time. Again, no tolerance and I hadn't had a benzo for weeks.


Conclusions:

Eat light before this stuff. Like soup or salad light. And not eating is the best, or letting the food digest first. I just imagine it in my stomach getting stuck in the mashed up wad of digesting food.. its just not ideal scenario if you want maximum absorption of this chemical. Which i do.


And.. this stuff is definitely shallow. When people complain about the lack of a spiritual component (i use that lightly, i am an atheist and not spiritual at all).... People are correct when they say this. It is pure eye candy. I can't imagine what three hits would be like (450mcg). And I would never take four (600). Fuck that. 


At the end of the day, I would eat this over LSD every single time. It is 5x more smooth on my body although their is some mental confusion on it. Good clean L doesn't confuse me at all and I can think extremely clear.

I believe how benzos can weaken a trip is really understated, IMO. I'm not even talking about the same day of the trip. In my experience I have noticed weakened effects if benzos had been taken within the  past week. Theres cases in my town where kids getting really good WoW and then complaining its fake or they don't feel anything. The thing is, they were taking klonopin.


You simply cannot trip and get off the correct way while on a benzo, unfortunately it is just impossible. Also they stay in the system really long I think thats why the weakening of effects can happen even after days of not taking them.

@ waferz: I agree regarding the benzos. That's what I mentioned to Kishka a couple of posts above yours, but got not response. Some of these drugs have a rather short half-life, but some don't -- the longer the half-life, the more the substance will interfere with psychedelic action. This is especially apparent if benzos are taken on a regular basis, and even more so if psychedelics are taken more than once per week.

Thats actually not the case for everyone. I personally don't find benzos do much more than remove my aniexty and change the trip slightly but don't really dull it. I've seen others say similar things too. It's definitely not the norm but.... 


From what I remember, Pyrazolam isn't that potent and has a short half life. Also that it's a pretty basic anxiolytic. You would have definitely at least felt something from 225ug of AL-LAD.

Like you said, it's not the norm, but... different metabolisms result in different effects. As for Kishka, if her metabolism is in your group, then we can chuck it to either too much tolerance or degraded AL-LAD. I bet that the former was the culprit, but we won't know until she tries more, after a period of abstinence, from the same batch. The bottom line is that 225ug of AL-LAD should yield, at the very least, a rock solid ++ in nearly all cases.

Yup, I think it was probably a tolerance issue. I will try it again in a few days and see how it works. Normally it's not degraded, i tend to be over maniac about this ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Seriously, any one taking AL-LAD, 1-P-LSD, ETH-LAD dosed on premade blotters have absolutely no idea how much they are taking.


The blotters aren't evenly laid, even on the same sheet. That's the whole point. Two adjacent blotters can easily absorb a 50-100 ug difference by accident. In my opinion. It's very small quantities we are talking about here, and you would need to spray it on, or place single drops with a micropipette to get totally exact doses per blotter. Using soaking, which must be how the official blotters are laid as it's the only viable method for massproduction, will always cause hot/weak spots.


I am completely sure that if you have the powder, and use a laboratory grade ug scale and volumetric dosing, then you won't get as big a variability in potency as people are finding with these novel lysergamides. Obviously, set, setting and internal body chemistry is also factors, but uneven distribution is in my opinion the biggest culprit.


Don't get me wrong, most of the blotters are approxemately the same strength, but some are clearly weaker, and some clearly stronger, even on the same sheet.

@ Kishka - My Magic 8-Ball said "outlook good"! Don't forget to come back to tell us how it went!


@ Bassoon - In your opinion, is that the norm or the exception?


@ Everyone - It's extremely important to stress that buyers of lysergamide powder must use a professional microgram scale, a professional micropipette, gloves, goggles, and a PM2.5 mask.

Yeah seriously I would love to have powder but it's very damn expensive.... I don't think the blotters of AL-LAD i had are bunk, because I tripped from them and they are from 2013... 


I think I didn't trip of 225µg was due to the pyrazolam I took (1.5mg which is considered to be a strong dose) and the fact I haven't wait longer to trip again...


On a side note, how long should someone wait before able to feel full effects? 7 days or 14 days ?


Thank you again tho ![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif)

I'm inclined to agree with pretty much everything that you've been saying. It's all very reasonable. My guesstimate is that the average mass-produced sheet will contain tabs with deviations of up to +/- 15%, but most of them are within +/- 10%.

I've been doing a sloppy and informal experiment to see how much AL-LAD degrades. 


I have some AL-LAD tabs that I've had lying around at room temperature for over a year now. Most of the time they've been wrapped in tinfoil, and then nestled in some dry rice kernels in a sealed container, so they've been kept mostly dry and dark, but not cold. I've been playing around with micro-doses of these here and there over the year. The other day I dosed an aprox. 30µg slice of blotter, and it had what I reckon is the same level of threshold activity that I noticed about a year ago when these tabs were brand new.


I think AL-LAD is pretty stable if it's kept dry and in the dark. There was talk some time ago that this molecule is fragile and more prone to degradation than LSD, but as far as I can tell there's nothing in particular to worry about with AL-LAD. Let's hope the same goes for ETH-LAD!

Have to concur, had AL-LAD stored in an airtight container in the dark at room temperature (which sometimes translates to over 30C in this neck of the woods in the summer) for two years. Recently took a tab, still the same old.

Mine still seem to be doing quite alright..


This time AL-LAD had the CAPS on! ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)


1 and then 0,5 tab an hour later let my 'museum dose' while fishing quite unexpectedly evolve into a rupturing ++++


Perhaps it was the lack of external stimuli that triggered this, (it was dark, looking at blackness off still  water in front) but this one hit me good and hard.. I dont know if you can trip harder.. (probably ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)) So a plus 5 seems a bit definitive but effects in order of appearrance:


-starting with very heavy blurry fractalesque oev

-[time dillation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Time_distortion)

-rite of passage type associations

-[becoming one with your environment](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Unity_and_interconnectedness)

I remember showing off a bit (due to previous association) walking home quite fast over a very narrow sidewalk while dodging various objects, while ablaze... At times only seeing me seperating the road on my left which became white and void with orange and purple plumes of energy on my right, it was like a wind tunnel smoke flaming effect with on my right these plumes of energy and void and me walking like some sort of cord dancer half eveporating on the edge of an abyss.. At times only experiencing this or actively moving trough various states of being that were sometimes visable as bright glowing orange/red particles entering me it looked quite spectacular and felt amazing...

-[feelings of interdependant opposites](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Feelings_of_interdependent_opposites)

-[conceptual thinking](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Conceptual_thinking) very cool but need to think this experience over to put into words.

-[level 8A geometry](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Level_8A) 

Experiencing this for the first time could be a bit creepy as it felt like an intelligence that was evaluating or testing me other than my thoughts triggerring this, so I was overthinking my responses.. 


By thinking it didn't matter anyway as this was clearly some cosmic event ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) and my petty thoughts would hardly matter now, so I should just enjoy it.. (by then safe at home) I would let go and it would evolve into a total dissolution of self into a fractal vortex often consisting of 4 equal parts of various imagery, sometimes holy men or sometimes conceptual particles swirling into one ness. Like being drained upwards..


Looking back it's pretty cool how you can steer the character and intensity with thought and some of these things are so funny now.

I've never had such intensity or control before with other materials, and 1 tab of AL-LAD didn't produce any visuals for me the first time I tried it and only lasted 4 hours this time 5/6 hours with a small redose at the end (100mcg which was a bit of a waste) so it tailed out at 10 hours


Are these effects common at an initial dose of 225mcg and something you can reproduce and improve upon with more experience?

I've got to get some of this stuff....the more I hear about it te more I think it would be right up my alley


Other than I'm sure it wouldn't last long enough....my metabolism is speedy and psychs never last very long for me....when they say something lasts 4-6 hours I'm always on the 4 hour end....in fact normally I'd be dead sober in 4 hours like with a 4 substituted trypt....I'm dead sober in 4 hours

I was at a wedding this past weekend. The booze dried up pretty early so I ran to the car and grabbed a few tabs for myself and my friends. We took them and had an absolute blast. After the wedding was over (just as I was peaking) we went to the casino at the hotel we were staying at. We all played craps until about 3 am. I was able to play coherently and won about a hundred bucks. 


It was an absolute blast tripping while gambling with a big group of your friends. For the most part, people just thought we were drunk (although I was a bit sweaty and my pupils were huge). 


All the lights and noises from the casino were a trip for sure. It was hilarious. Another amazing experience with an amazing substance.

Hi,


Ok so it was probably due to tolerance and Benzo now!


I tried AL-LAD again 4 days ago, 150µg without any benzo in my system and almost had a bad trip on it!


It was CLEARLY active, I experienced scary thought loops and mind blowing music distortion aswell. 


Trip lasted 9 hours and even strong visuals !


Still clearly active, was my own fault !


Even got me by surprise, I was overwhelmed during the comeup and kind of lost my shit, I had to go to tripsit.me to have some help ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


Good stuff btw !


PS : The tabs was from July 2013 so it's still potent as before

I'm glad to hear that your AL-LAD is still good. I was pretty sure that the issue was tolerance and the benzos, so thank you for confirming it. Both will sneak up on you quickly. The result of that is dulled trips. Some people say that this isn't so for them, but that's because they're used to their trips being less than what they could be. They're missing out on the full potential -- good and bad -- of what these substances can do.


I suggest that you carefully taper off the benzos (if you're still taking them), and instead, have them around for emergencies only (i.e. panic attacks, or to calm down an unbearably negative trip). That way, you'll understand the full effects profile of each and every psychedelic -- physical, and most importantly, psychological. One of the most rewarding things about psychedelics is the challenge to have to mentally resolve difficult experiences. Such experiences, if successfully dealt with, often (almost always, in fact) build psychological fortitude, and therefore, character -- this can empower you "in real life". It's all in the mind, after all. Meanwhile, they can also lead to excellent introspection, problem solving, and even breakthroughs. Tolerance and benzos decrease that potential.


Alright, I have to go now, but have a good night, Kishka. Catch you later...

Yeah I must say it was challenging, I know now why I thought AL-LAD was only visual and no mental, it's because I was taking Etizolam or Diazepam before the trip so I only had the visuals. But damn without them, I had plenty of mental effects and I was not used to it... It was overwhelming.


AL-LAD is deep, not to be underestimated.

I noticed some confusion with this stuff @ 300mcgs...


Went to use the microwave and entered in some arbitrary amount of time (like over 10 minutes) when it only needed 20 seconds.. thankfully I caught myself but it made me more aware of the 'mental fog' this stuff has versus regular L.


Regular L, to me IME, has a crystal clear mindstate where focusing is not a problem at all.

Perhaps a tolerance break would be beneficial? In my experience,  AL-LAD is the easiest psych on the mind (easier for me than THC). But with anything, if you start pushing it, it can bite back.

Tried 150ug of this last week and I'll be taking the same amount tomorrow. Would there be any contraindication in using a small dose of 4-aco-DMT after 7 or 8 hours, when the effects have mostly worn off?

No contraindications, but you might not get much psychedelic effects by that point because of tolerance (or you might still, not sure). It will keep you up a lot longer. The most likely scenario I imagine is that you'll get a tiny extra psychedelic boost and be up for an extra 4-6 hours.

I did,  but  I never had beads of sweat, but I was warm.  It could be like this for some people, another reason to titrate accordingly.  What does one do if they think they are overheating anyways?

I felt like i was over heating during experiments with the first release batch of AL-LAD blotters. I never dosed any higher than one and a half tabs. 

The sensation of overheating i experienced felt as if my core temperature was rising to an uncomfortable level though i never had a thermometer to hand to check my actual temperature at the time. 

The overheating feeling would manifest towards the end of the plateau. The AL-LAD experience for me usually kicked in very quickly and i would be back to baseline within 6 hours. I have never felt like using it since my first experiments because of the overheating sensation i experienced, though i do still have some samples stored in deep freeze should i get the urge.

I am quite experienced with tripping having first tried LSD back in the early 1980's and then going on to try a different number of psychedelics over the years. The only other times i have had a feeling of overheating has been during some mescaline experiences after ingesting cactus preperations, but only a small number of these sessions resulted in a feeling of overheating and nowhere near the degree i felt with my AL-LAD experiences.

Wow...thanks , I'm glad that I'm not te only one...yeah i would like to know if this is the same type of hyperthermia that one would experience on MDMA? What does one do in this situation and just how dangerous is it? I'm surprized this issue has not been addressed before. Is this a symptom many psychedelics can produce or is it pretty limited to MDMA? Or phenethylamines ? What is the exact action of this? I noticed it only has happened only on my higher dosed trials so it seems dose dependant

Overheating seems worse with stimulants (like mdma, amphetamines, phenidates) than psychedelics. If it gets bad then of course it's dangerous, you can dehydrate, get heat stroke & it's possibly associated with neurotoxicity, in extreme cases it can kill. In that situation you try to cool yourself down, rehydrate yourself (drink some water & electrolytes like salt, but not too much), use water/ice on your skin, go somewhere cooler, etc. If you get so hot that it's making you feel ill then seek medical attention.


I often seem to get cold hands & feet on psychedelics, can't remember getting sweaty like on mdma, possibly too much dopamine/serotonin/adrenalin causes overheating. I think most psychedelics are serotonin agonists rather than releasers, but some do both. I guess AMT could increase body temperature as it's a triple releaser like mdma, maoi & psychedelic too, I only tried a threshold dose & noticed some increase in body temperature. I'm not sure how well studied al-lad is, if anybody knows exactly what it does.


Wiggling my fingers & toes or moving around seems to help the cold hands & feet. Weed sometimes helps with the body load, and it usually boosts trips, but it failed to do much when I took al-lad.


One of those grey 150ug al-lad blotters seemed almost inactive to me & mildly unpleasant. I didn't trip off it at all, I just got muscle tension, some stimulation, a small panic attack for about 5 minutes, dilated pupils, a slight sickly/weak feeling & that's all, didn't feel hot or anything, no visuals even eyes closed, no euphoria, couldn't even manage a giggle at a comedy on TV, I was higher before the al-lad from a small spliff. I know 'bad acid' is a controversial topic, it's probably some small impurity that caused the grey colour, the amounts would likely be too tiny on one 150ug blotter to do much or anything at all, but I didn't like it. It was possibly some tolerance from my bk-2c-b/5-meo-dalt binge that ended 9 days before, bad state of mind & a boring night in alone, but it didn't feel right to me at all, it was my first & only al-lad trip though. Some of the body load & slightly clouded thought continued for 24 hours, like a mild acid hangover, but most of it was gone in a few hours.


I don't usually get panic attacks, I don't remember ever having one before & certainly not since, it only lasted a few minutes before I calmed myself down, but it was intense, my heart rate went up to 180bpm (33 years old, normal resting rate about 60bpm for me, measured on a fingertip pulse oximeter), but it started from anxiety that I wasn't getting the expected mental effects, just some body load, worrying I'd been sent the wrong drug, etc.


I will have to try it again sometime, maybe it was just me that night, I wasn't in the best state of mind after a long psychedelic binge, but I'm not in any rush to do it. I've got 3 other psychedelics that I haven't given a fair trial either, another two I know I love & apparently mushroom season has started early too... so it's 7th on my list of psychedelics to try.

Had some scary trips myself on 300mcg. Music sounded alien and evil haha.

I think the blotters aren't even in dose. Most 300mcg trips are beautifull, but i had two instances of the trip feeling like i took double or triple the dose and ended up feeling like i was going insane (even the terrifying trips ended up being awesome in the end though)


Thought i was dead once too, but still kept my shit together.

I think I've had that overheating thing last sunday when my head felt  very hot. I haven't had that before (have taken ten blotters in total over  the course of a year and a half; last sunday I had taken 1 blotter of al-lad  and half a 1p-lsd). It didn't last very long but it was slightly  disconcerting for a while.


Something I observed with al-lad a  couple of times was how I distinctly noticed the exact moment the  plateau ended. It was literally a realization: 'ok bang so now it's  over'. I call it being kicked out of paradise but I think I picked up  that phrase from this board.

@ Kishka...I also bought a lot of AL-LAD in 2013, and it's still potent as hell. And while I don't have time to get into it right now, I find it amusing that people sometimes say that you can't go "deep" with AL. WHile I agree it's nothing like LSD in that regard, it can kick your ass at high doses. I have built a tolerance lately, taking 1-P, ETH-LAD or AL each weekend for about 6 weeks, I took 750 ug's (yes...but usually do 300 to 450 anyway) last weekend and I tripped so hard and such huge ego-dissolution that I was like semi-conscious, and drifting in this strange space where stories were playing themselves out that had nothing at all to do with the music I was listening to. It was almost like a blackout, but deep in psychedelia, for sure. I really felt like I got hit with a psychedelic sledge-hammer...in a good but very serious way. AL-...while not as beloved as LSD or even high dose mushroom trips, is really a phenomenally useful tool, and I've learned a lot about myself experimenting with it.

Hi,


Does any of you by the way knows if AL-LAD is toxic or physically dangerous?


What are the chance of dying from lets say an heart attack, stroke or dropping dead? Does it carry the same safety profile as LSD?


I've seen a video where Dr David Nichols mentionned that AL-LAD was x3.48 stronger than LSD.


Any ideas? ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Not at all, unless say you were already predisposed to that sort of thing. Then you may drop whenever. Lysergamides have shown some of the highest safety profiles of all psychedelics. Comparatively at least(not to make them sound any less safe!).


Nichols is most likely talking about agonism because ug for ug LSD is stronger. Either way strength means nothing..... LSD is active at 45ugs but dependent it'd take forty thousand times more to kill you(and that's just me going off the top of my head it may well be eighty...). 


I know it's difficult to help but your a thousand times more likely to drop dead of a heart attack after years of OCD sorta stuff then just a dose of AL-LAD(also if your worried about these things, learn about them there are few things more interesting...plus that way you won't be trusting some random internet people...![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)).

Hi,


Thank you Help ! So we could established that AL-LAD is very safe ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

had some al-lad wrapped in paper in a book in my bag which got very hot (up to 40 degrees). My bag also got soaked one day at the beach. A few days later they were indeed still very active. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Is there possible any sniffing dog which can detect a sealed bag of gram of al-lad in airport or any customs?

How is it possible, that im so very sensitive for even threshold doses of tryptamines like 4_ho_met and 4aco-dmt, but 150μg of AL-LAD barely made my trip a + experience? 


I've done it twice, on empty stomach, had the blotters under tongue for a few minutes, then wash it down with a big glass of water. I did experience a short duration of happy giggles an hour later, I did see some patterns and letters that appeared to breathe in a magazine i was reading meanwhile, but i really had to focus to get these visuals, focus to a point where i wasnt really sure if i had mild OEVs or if it was all just a placebo effect. Nothing even close to hallucinations on tryptamines i previously had experienced.


I just wonder, what am i doing wrong here? Its the most expensive drug i've purchased but so far, even weed gives me a more psychedelic experience than this. Did water maybe destroy it after i washed it down with the water? Whats your idea why im failing here?


Thanks

Everyone is different.  I am kind of a hardhead to everything now (except, strangely, DMT), due to past overuse of psychedelics, but when I first started tripping, I took low doses of tryptamines and phenethylamines compared to most and would get blown away.  Conversely, with LSD, I was never able to push past threshold, even when friends taking less of the same batch would be off their face.  Fast forward to current times, I find the same is true with lysergamides.  AL-LAD, for example, I don't really bother taking less than 300ug of, and I prefer 450.

Interesting. I don't consider myself a particularly heavy user of psychedelics. I've taken them around 10 times in 2 years, although i must say, that last month 30 days ago i took a huge dose of 4 ho met (75mg) so it could've heavily altered my tolerance for psychs. 

I will test if low 5-10mg doses of 4ho met also fail to produce a trip for me, like they did in the past, so i know if i gained the tolerance for psychs

I finally got around to trying the ~150ug sample blotter of AL-LAD I got off one of the darknet marketplaces. I think I've had it in my possession for at least most of this year, but stored in a cool, dry location. 


Two hours after dosing, I barely felt anything more than a few alerts to suggest that there was, indeed, a drug in my body. 

With great disappointment I then ingested half a tab (~600ug) of 25B-NBOMe. This seemed to combine nicely with the AL-LAD, as I believe I tripped harder than I have from that amount of 25B by itself in the past. 


Although both chemicals are known for being visual, my trip was lacking in that department. I was in an environment known for sensory overload (a party at Alex Grey's Chapel of Sacred Mirrors), and the various sights seemed somewhat enhanced but weren't particularly inclined to morph in my vision. I wasn't bothered by this though, as everything there is already so incredibly beautiful to begin with. 

Headspace was very shallow, allowing me to enjoy everything going on around me without being sucked into introspection. I realized afterwards that I did not have any thoughts about the men in my life (romantically speaking), which is something my thoughts almost always go to while tripping. This realization really defined the lack of mental depth for me. 

Although at the same time that I was not having profound thoughts, I found myself making clever remarks to my friends, despite the fact that I sometimes had difficulty getting words out. Some psychedelics seem to make me wittier than others (4-HO-MiPT is another that tends to have this effect). And during the car ride home, where I might usually be quiet and/or fall asleep, I was the chattiest on in the car. I blame this on the stimulating nature of 25B. 


A couple other interesting effects: 

- Warped audio perception. Sounds seemed to come from the wrong location. I noticed this a handful of times throughout the night... I always find audio hallucinations very interesting as I do not experience them too often. 

- Disjointed thoughts and images while trying to fall asleep. They occurred quickly in succession and mostly unrelated to my conscious thoughts. Towards the very end of the night as I struggled to sleep, the images started to become disturbing (gore, human waste, etc.) They didn't particularly frighten me, but I actively tried to make them go away. Closed-eye visuals are by no means unusual for me to experience while trying to sleep, but these immediately seemed different than the typical.


I managed to fall asleep about 9 hours after dosing the 25B, but with much difficulty. I almost reached for a benzo, but finally got myself to focus on the darkness behind my eyelids until there was nothing else.

It is quite possible that the reason that you are not experiencing much of an effect from the AL-LAD is because you "wash it down with a big glass of water".  Assuming that there is chlorine in the water that you are drinking, and chlorine is known to quickly and efficiently kill LSD.  I did a quick google search to see if chlorine killed AL-LAD in the same manner that it does LSD, which I assumed it would based on their structural similarities and found this;


"AL-LAD molar mass = 349.4693

1 gram of Chlorine would destroy 4.9g of AL-LAD


50ug of AL-LAD = 0.000000143074084 moles

50ug of Chlorine would destroy 245ug of AL-LAD

therefore 10ml of tap water would destroy 245ug of AL-LAD"

It's not unusual to feel little from 150ug of AL-LAD. Now, I am a hard head, and usually do 450 to 600 of AL. But even when I first tried it, 150 was barely perceptible overall. In my estimation, AL-LAD shines when you start to up the dose to 300 and beyond.

Nope, I am aware of the effect chlorine has on LSD and as such did not want to risk it with AL-LAD. I didn't drink any water for at least an hour after ingestion. 


I am not particularly a psychedelic hardhead, and my last trip before this one was three weeks ago. Based on trip reports, I know a lot of people find 150ug underwhelming, even though others have a ++/+++ experience from the same dose. I was just hoping to be in the latter camp ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png) oh well. 


I'd like to try AL-LAD again at a higher dose, but for now I am more interested in sampling 1p-LSD.

Great info darkstarcrashes, I did not know (chlorinated) water could destroy al-lad. I drank it because i always had a bit of trouble swallowing the blotter alone. I always sensed it got stuck in my throat, which is why i made a mistake of washing it down. Maybe next time, i will take a beer or a shot of vodka instead ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

This whole thread is intriguing, I have not yet (deliberately) ingested any lysergamide RC - although I continue to eat LSD probably more often than I really need to.  I have quite a few pet "projects" going on at the moment, although I may be interested in either buying some 14lb watercolor paper or some blotter art and laying a few sheets of one of these novel chems, assuming that I can find them in their pure form somewhere on the darknet.  I see that there is some inconsistency with dosage & effect here with the AL-LAD, I guess I will browse these forums and trip reports and try to determine what the "best" (subjective, I know) lysergamide RC is out there that will suit my purposes.  I am open to suggestions as well, and may also consider just making the liquid solution and dosing it from a vial...

I'm quite inexperienced with psychedelia. I have done two low dose and one moderate dosed mushroom trips. I've done al-lad 2 times, 150 ug the first time and 225 the second and I have tried 1p-lsd once, 50 ug.


The first time al-lad I experienced only minor effects. A few closed eyed visuals, colours were a bit brighter and a good lift in mood. I ate a big breakfast just before and after 5 minutes having the blotter under my tongue I tried chewing up the blotter, but it became a small hard ball. I swallowed the blotter.


225 ug was a different story. I took that on an empty stomach and held the blotter under my tongue for 20 minutes before swallowing. 

I was tripping unexpectedly hard. With 3 dimensional shapes floating in mid air. It was manageable though, but I was glad I was at home. 


Next week the liberation of our city is celebrated and I would like to try 150ug of al- lad again to see if I did something wrong. If  there is little effect after 1.5 hours I want to take 75 mg MDMA to ensure I have a good time. This is half the MDMA I normally take.


Do you guy's think that there is a big chance that the experience will be to overwhelming?

I think that 225ug will be to much for me to do in public.


There will be a big carnival lots of live music and a large fireworks show.


Other options are half a tab eth-lad or a tab of 1p-lsd.

What's the consensus about oral vs sublingual activity?


Just speaking from personal experience, directly swallowing half a standard 150µg tab provided absolutely no noticeable effects (with zero tolerance), whereas (in another trial), sublingual administration of the other half of that same tab showed clear activity.

I don't do sub-lingual, and don't even cheek it. I swallow it (usually between 450 and 600 ug) and I trip hard. Comes up within 35 to 40 min, with anything after an hour intense enough to find a place, with a heady, strong trip coming, and not go anywhere.

Ate 1/3rd of a 150µg tab last night at a nightclub, mainly to stay awake while suffering from jet lag. I enjoyed a decently mild trip, small amount of nausea but relatively stimulated & trippy mindset for 6 hours. Small amount of visual effects, nice body high. The party was overcrowded so it was kind of perfect not to be too high.

^haha! I did the exact same thing at a festival in Colorado! I was so dabbed out of my mind that I couldn't even keep my eyes open, so I took about 1/3 of a hit of allacid just to freaking wake up and was surprised with a nice low level trip. I didn't think that I'd even feel that low of dose 50ug!

AL-LAD's duration makes this chemical especially attractive. I prefer slightly shorter experiences than LSD and this could be an alternative. Several of y'all have had this chemical awhile. Is this chemical also as potent as LSD? Compared with LSD, is this chemical at least as stable?

AL-LAD is certainly less potent than LSD, I'm guessing it is about half as potent, but I think it does depend on which part of the dose curve you're talking about. 150µg seems less potent than a typical street tab of LSD purported to be 100µg (but likely 60-100µg).


From reports it seems like AL-LAD may be harder to handle at high doses than LSD is, making me think that it might be less efficient, but be a more effective agonist ultimately. As in, it's a partial agonist, but maybe on the scale between partial agonist and full agonist, a little bit more towards the full end of the spectrum than LSD is, yet at the same time less potent per µg than LSD in the middle of the dose range. Just conjecture.

Yes it's less potent, probably roughly half as potent like perpetual said.  It seems similarly stable also though I have no proof.  I have had some hits for a while and last time I tried one it was still just as good.

found this chem pretty enjoyable the few times I took it by itself, albeit a little weak (even at higher doses). However, I'd like to warn everyone, I would strongly advise AGAINST comboing w/ 25x (IME, 25c). While comboing it with LSZ proved to be an incredible, flooring, beautiful experience, AL-LAD was horrific (BOTH times - can't believe I tempted fate again!)  - some truly scary thought loops, as well as cutting in and out of consciousness and uncontrollable intrusive thoughts. Oh, and nasty brain zaps. Just a real unpleasant ordeal that seemed to last an eternity, despite a rapid recession of effects after 2 hours.

Hey guysvib have a question why v is the al lad crystal so damn dark? I was always told the more white the lsd the better. For example the best lsd called needlepoint is <99% pure. and as the name says under a microscope it looks like needlepoints. Its white in color then there is fluff which is <99% pure.

Then the color changes to a silverish color and most of the time you will be getting that need point is really hard to find because the yield is probably lower and the chemist will keep it. 

Then it gets dark there is another grade called Amber crystal its still good but as you get less or this less clean people find the lsd to be. There is other crystal lsd that v is as dark as the al lad, I have never seen it but all who have say it is super dirty feeling.

The first and only time I tried it I tried 2 hits and felt nothing but I think the benzos I had Messed it up. I want to try it again but its dark and the purity of this is less than 1p lsd which is <99% and eth lad 99℅ and they are both white crystal. The al lad however is <97% and listed as dark grey powder. So I guess it's really dark siverish in color. 

I'm think shulgin described it as a white crystal.

Possibly if <99% grade al lad was made  the dosage will go down? Because it's expensive compared to lsd. Butthe visuals it what interests me the most about this I have heard they are quite strong. 

Anyway having to take 3 tabs at a time to get a good trip for 6 hours isn't ideal.

If you're disappointed with the potency of the 97% pure AL-LAD, tear off 9% of an blotter to get the missing 15mcg. Or don't take benzos when you trip.

I just heard a report from someone who said their ETH-LAD crystal was black, and you're saying it's white.  Is there some oxidation happening after it's been exposed to air/light for long enough?

Okay so if you go to the only supplier that has 1p eth lad and al lad and click details you can find this info.

1p lsd <99% white fluffy crystalline powder

Eth lad <97% grey powder

Al lad <97% DARK grey powder

In going on the assumption that the darker the crystal the more impure the synthesis.

Hi guys


I bough some blotter from the most known shop just before the ban (so, not the fist batch). The big white blotter, with the name writen on it. I fell that these blotters are really dosed lower than other I got previously from another source.


There is really a big difference, if I consider that the one of my other source are at 150ug, the  one "with name on it" seems to be at 100ug, probably less. 

I use to take 1,5 blotter with the first one to reach my sweet spot, and with 2,5 blotter from the other, it is still weaker. 

I tried many time each batch, so it's not a set and setting cause or something else....


I am the only one to find the blotter "with the name on it" of the last batch pretty weak ?

I have only tried AL-LAD with the name printed on it from some time ago, so I can't comment on any differences in potency.

I've tried the official blotters many times and all felt like the doses were  equal on all.

For what it's worth, I know that many people found lower doses of AL to be less than thrilling. I know that I've gotten it from "the" places that most other people got them from, and I didn't really enjoy it until I went beyond 300 ug. Now, I am a hard head, and prefer about 450ug of AL, but even when my tolerance was non-existent, one tab that was alleged to be 150ug was nothing to write home about. But...when I pushed the envelope with it, it shined, especially at 450 to 600, like I said. Having said that, I don't even enjoy LSD the way I want unless I am above 300ug as well, and like 400 to 500ug preferably. But that's me, and I don't recommend high dosing unless you know what you're doing.

I have a vivd memory related to usage of LSD and time.


I remember the LSD was coming on, peaking. I tried to determine the exact time since ingestion and tried to record the current time.

I had an old style analog clock. The thing made no damn sense to me. I did not understand why there were 12 numbers on it. Why 12? Why not 10? Or 24? I knew one revolution of the hand was 60 minutes, but why would 60 minutes equal one hour? What is with the 12 numbers? Every time the number increments, there is an extra 5 minutes that had passed. It made absolutely no sense at all. I couldn't determine how much time had passed from 12:30 until 1:50. It was utterly maddening. What was time? Who decided on this arbitrary fucked up way of record keeping? What did it mean when the little hand was between numbers? How can anyone ever be sure what, where, and when they are, precisely? Wouldn't this information be required to make an accurate assumption about your place, and when? You would never read the current time, as by the time you read it, more time had already passed. 


I went into a full-blown crisis over this, so desperately trying to figure out the passage of time. It did not help that at some instances the clock seemed to be moving backwards, or not moving at all. It was so absolutely frustratingly hellish. I was sure time did not exist anymore. Then i got the fear. What happened if time stopped? How could it be started again, if in the absence of time, you were not able to formulate the intent to do something about it? Would you be forever stuck in a timeless world, with nothing ever happening ever again? 


Madness! I took a pendulum, tied it to my bed lamp, and pushed it. The soothing swinging undulations reassured me, that time was indeed still passing, and i gave up all endeavours related to making sense of time. 


The memory of this still trips me up sometimes when looking at a clock.

Thinking of giving this a try. From reading this whole thread, it seems like there is a huge dose curve. I'd be inclined to think maybe the blotters are not uniformly laid. 

I wonder if 1P is more uniform in its dose response? 

Anyone have experience with both care to comment?

I don't know, I just think there is variability in individual response. I've done AL-LAD five times and it has always given me the expected results... I've had it from two different batches. My girlfriend hasn't noticed any variability in the tabs neither. I've had a couple of experiences with 1P also, and I would say they are uniformly laid, but in he first big and dandy thread some people were claiming otherwise.

No matter what you think, do not take more than one tab at first.


150 mcg is quite a dosage, first time i took 1 1/2 tabs of this stuff and i bit off a bit too much, was not ready. 


If these are indeed laid "professionally", and have 150 mcg of AL-LAD on it then that should produce an unmistakable effect.

I agree, one should always start with 1 tab if they haven't taken it before.  I have a high natural tolerance to lysergamides, always have, I'd take LSD with friends from the same batch and I'd barely feel it while they'd be tripping hard.  For me 300ug of AL-LAD feels nice but weak... 150ug is threshold, I barely notice it.  450ug is where it gets good for me.  But I wouldn't recommend anyone jump in even close to there for their first time.

just got a batch of powder from my vendor who was currently running a sale.  i bought eth last time and the powder was a dark sandy color from what i can remember.


the al was dark black looking and almost clumped and stuck alltogether.  anyone else have experience with the powder and know the correct color?  just wondering if they offered the discount because they got a bad batch or not.  thanks for any input!

I suspect it's either got a slight impurity (even slight impurities can dramatically color a compound), or it's been around a while and has oxidized a bit and they're trying to get rid of the rest of it.  Either way, I've heard that the black AL-LAD is still plenty good.  I've never personally seen any of the lysergamide powders so I am just reporting hearsay.

just had some friends dose 300mics with a 150 redose 90 minutes later.  they had a fabulous time with one even reporting full blow hallucinations in the dark outside.  

maybe its just myself that is javing trouble with this one.  im starting to suspect im using too frequently and building a tolerance fast to this one.  will give it a few weeks and see what happens.

Mh, i took 1 and 1/4 blotter of 150 mcg AL-LAD yesterday. 


There was definitely something, but i couldn't put my finger on it. Visuals were non-existent unless you REALLY focus on something.

There was a fantastic body feeling though, and i got the munchies like crazy. I went through 1 pork chop broccoli mashed potato dinner, 3 Nacho and cheese plates with onion and bacon, 6 twinkies, 1 bag of ruffles sour cream and onion and the remainder of the bag of Doritos that i used to make the nacho plates with. Wow. 

Tactile sensation was heightened, head-space sort of half-way there but not really. But holly crap did i feel great physically.


Vision went blurry instead of crisp and clear like with ETH-LAD, and there was no body-load that i can not attribute to the massive amounts of food i ingested. But even then, the food felt soooo good inside me. I smoked some cannabis at what i thought was the peak, but it only enhanced my body-buzz and did nothing whatsoever for the visuals and headspace. I took the most pleasant poo of all time, showering felt orgasmic, and there was no real come-down either. Tactile sensations were amplified, music and sound completely undistorted, but some time-dilation was felt around the three hour mark. Minor.


I went to sleep undisturbed, woke up and felt great. None of that LSD afterglow unfortunately either. Last time i had some lysergic compound was two weeks prior on 250 mcg of ETH-LAD, and that was far more intense and visual mindfuckery than this.


AL-LAD, at this dosage, seems a very easygoing, gentle, light and pleasant compound. It was much more of a mental tonic than a psychedelic at this level. Will try 2 or more hits 2 or so weeks from now.

I find it to be easygoing and light at every dosage I've tried (up to 450ug).  For me even 2 hits (300ug) is pretty underwhelming but as you say, very enjoyable, but 3 starts to get really good.

I am not to say that i was "let down" Xorkoth, but you need to be someone who has worked with lysergamides before to appreciate the effects of it. If i would have never done acid, and 186 mcg of AL-LAD was my first experience, i would swear to you that nothing was happening at all. 


But if you have some experience and know what and where to tune into, there is unmistakably something at work very mild and easy going. 


So far ETH-LAD seems to produce a more pronounced effect that AL-LAD at similar dosages. And by pronounced i mean qualitatively. I was barely functioning on ETH-LAD, had to take a rest almost the entirety of it and firmly hold on to the trip, but AL-LAD, 3 hours in i could swear i took nothing at all, and push the pseudo-expanded, quasi-intellectual headspace aside. I even picked up a phone-call from work who wanted me to work overtime, near the peak of my experience, on acid, i would have hid in the closet under three blankets if that happened. 


AL-LAD was Simple, enjoyable. Maybe i will eat the remaining 3 3/4 tabs all at once then? I don't mind having something have it's way with me for a while.


On another note, AL-LAD seems to be shorter acting compared to ETH-LAD. ETH-LAD was still going at the 12 hour mark for me with the visuals. After 8 hours of AL-LAD i was so comfy on the couch in such a nice and happy place i was drifting in a sleepy blisfull euphoria. Not much at all anymore.


Also i comlained about muscle cramps with ETH-LAD before, especially lower legs and upper thighs, during and after usage, AL-LAD left me feeling completely at ease and no muscle cramps, but a horrendous gut ache that gave birth to a 12 pound baby boy the next day.


Now, i just gotta give 1P-LSD the ol' college try, whaddaya figure? two tabs to start? 1 3/4 of ETH Lad was Strong, 1 1/4 of AL-LAD was Light and Pleasant, but 1P-LSD seems to be dosed lower (100 mcg) as well, so, 2 tabs? Do you have any experience Xorkoth you can share with me? I am not worried about taking a little too much and have it get strong on me, i am more concerned with taking a little bit too little and have to wait for tolerances to reset again.

Given your descriptions of other lysergamides I would think 2 tabs of 1p-LSD would be a good place to start.

For whatever it's worth, I think, based on using Al over the course of 2+ years, that you build a wicked tolerance from it/to it rapidly, and you have to take longer breaks than even LSD to avoid having to take more and more. I got to a point where I was using it every two weeks and after about 2 months of that, I was up to a whopping 750ug to get where I wanted. Yes, I am a hard-head, and yes, I like to trip hard, and yes, AL seems to be such an easy going chemical (for me) that large doses don't phase me or make me anxious. Having stopped for a while (about a month) I did some LSD, very good LSd at that, and quite a bit of it (400ug) and my trip was definitely not what it should have been. As others have speculated, there's a strong cross-tolerance with other similar psychedelics brought about by AL that seems longer lasting than that of other drugs in it's class such as ETH-LAD, 1P-LSD, LSZ, and LSD. Just a theory, but I was, at one point, saying to myself, "What happened to these tabs?", when, in fact, I just built up a tolerance that required having to take fuck-tons of it to trip properly. Just food for thought...

Just wanted to chime in here and say AL-LAD really goes well with LSD! Holy shit! I was at a tool show on 300ug AL, when I was feeling the vibe or something and dosed 2 hits of L - the synergy was beautiful! The visuals seemed brighter and shinier, almost like everything was super glossy plastic. The only slight downside(for me at the time) was the stimulation and duration was increased. I didn't come down until about 14 hours in the next morning, but it was worth it. I've been experimenting with AL for a while now, and it seems pretty shallow on its own, so it was refreshing to have the LSD bring the depth to the fantastically-smooth AL experience - and I was surprised how the two different effects merged into one unique effect. Highly recommended, but plan for a kinda long ride!

Yes, it's an unbelievable combination. Not sure I could handle myself in public though.

When I tried it I had multiple strong peaks unlike anything I've ever experienced.

The AL-LAD definitely intensifies the euphoric aspect of the trip, yet keeps you grounded in some odd way (IME anyway!)


Noticed the same downside - was too wired to sleep for what felt like an eternity.

If it wasn't for that I'd dose myself tomorrow!

al-lad is a very reproducible positive trip with little depth but great sensory input.


its the best for clubbing, really fun to dance on with a lack of paranoia which is good for overcrowded dingy venues with poor lighting and rough crowds dancing to jungle and drum n bass. mixes well with phenibut

Totally my experience too. I did 150 and it was pretty lame thought i maybe was tired or too soon from last acid trip. Then i did 150 again and had same results. I was going to give up on AL-LAD but decided to up the dose and then found it's one of my favorites. If you are taking lots you really kind of have to buy sheets with this because it's expensive if you are taking 3-4 hits at a time and paying the highest price for a little strip. 1p is more bang for your buck I only take one hit of that at a time.

So would you say depth and mind-effect wise it compares to something like 4-HO-MET?

 I was always a little hesitant and afraid with dosing since I'm not really into super deep psychedelics and just looking for some fun. 4-HO-MET was pretty optimal for that. Will AL-LAD be as well?


btw, can sign whats been said above me on dosing (75ug wasteful, 150ug boring with bodyload, 225ug still not very interesting).

Personally I found 150µg entirely worthwhile, even at around 25µg it was slightly trippy. But at 150µg it was still pretty light so I can see where people are coming from who find it underwhelming. I haven't gone above that.

my group is doing 600ug plus now weekly.  i tend to start at 300ug and move to another 300ug 90 minutes later.  but some of the harder heads in the group seem to be less sensitive and have to 450ug plus to even get above baseline.  i agree with above posters as this seems to build tolerance.  i found ETH stronger per dose and dont remember gaining much of a tolerance.   this week we try 1p for the first time.  i worry because the others think they need to start high because of their AL experiences.

Without much tolerance, i took 450 mcg of this stuff, and by two hours i wasn't sure i was feeling much of anything at all, but then i looked at the ceiling and it blew my mind. Black shadow clouds and swirling points that aggregate mass, i looked back at my monitor, and thought, holy fuck i could pass as sober right now. 


There was no body-load of any sort, and the head felt very clear. When i got up and moved about i knew something was off by t+ 2:30, when i noticed a strange kind of music that seemed to be playing in the background somewhere faint. 


I found myself able to read and digest information, i got this idea in my head that i wanted to learn how one could calculate the outside perimeter length of a fractal, i didn't figure it out, but i learned so much about these wonderful mathematical monsters that i could have not done on any other lysergamide.  Apparently the length and boundary of a fractal depends on how big your measuring stick is, the smaller of a unit you can measure in, the larger it becomes, which seems paradoxical.

For me, 2 tabs of AL is good, 3 is better but not wise in public, and 5 is the threshold of a break with reality.

After reading about as much as I could on these 3 newish lysergamides, I decided to try 1P first out of these 3, I took 150ug and was blown away and enjoyed the trip. What a powerhouse! I put in an order instantly to try the AL-LAD and ETH-LAD after further reading, it arrived today and I plan on dosing this weekend. 

A basic summary from my reading comparing to LSD.. AL-LAD is shorter acting in duration, a less intrusive head-space, easy going, less potent, more visual, euphoric, giggly. Where ETH is more potent, most are considering it almost empathogenic, produces nausea in some, especially higher doses, very connecting, "spiritual" rewarding experience, with intense visuals and less of a sinister head-space.

So I thought, why not combine the 2. I was considering trying 150ug AL-LAD with 50ug of ETH-LAD. I haven't found too many reports at all of this combo, if anyone has tried it would love to hear their experience, if not I will let you guys know mine soon enough.

^ yes please report back on the combo eclipse3130, I've been really wondering about that one, and don't think I've noticed a single report. 


I don't think there's anything wrong with the ratio you suggest, but I think it will be leaning to the AL-LAD side at those doses. Personally, I would shoot for an even balance of the two, which I'd say would be something like 100µg of AL-LAD with 75µg of ETH-LAD. I think probably just dose them at the same time - the eth first hits over half hour to an hour, and then has a second plateau around 2h, AL-LAD creeps in over about 2h from what I remember. Ideally you'd want to try each one independently first so that you can understand how they combine better.


Edit: I think the ratio I gave above might be a little ETH-LAD heavy. Maybe the balanced combo would be more like 50µg ETH-LAD with 100µg AL-LAD. Hard to say, and I'm interested to see what others think.

Tried 150ug last night. It was very mild and boring. I'd equate it to about 75ug of real lsd. Had some visuals such as painting moving a little, my emojis on my phone moving up and down (always happens) and my phone lock screen which is of the universe was moving as well. Expected way less deepness but I got super sucked into the movie speed racer. Taking 450ug in about 3 weeks

It seems this stuff has an unusually long tolerance, 14 days with no psychedelics after trying 150ug of AL-LAD prior I took 200ug and didn't have anything to show for, I just had an odd sensation in my neck throughout, it never developed into anything, at all. Must be more of a dopaminergic agonist, read elsewhere needs 4 weeks to reset.

I have also found that AL-LAD has a ridiculously long return to baseline and has a wicked cross-tolerance with other psychs. I have to wait 2 to 3 weeks to drop anything and truly feel it, and even if I wait 2 weeks, it seems like I have to take way more AL to get the same effects. It almost has a perma-tolerance feel to me, at least. I've wasted a good amount of AL- ETH-LAD and LSD not waiting long enough between trips. It's the only downside to AL, for me. For those that think AL is "boring", start getting into the 600+ug range with it. It will fuck up your program. Not recommending it unless you really feel like taking big doses like that. I think that AL has been under-estimated by some that don't venture into high dose territory. I've done a ten strip with tolerance and it was something, I'll tell you. And 6 to 900 with no tolerance can be pretty damn earth shattering, with some of the best CEVs and OEVs you'll ever see.

Took 450ug last night. Craziest visuals I've ever seen more than regular lsd. Little rainbow circles appearing out of the person's head I was with. Then everything looked like the matrix like all green and with numbers. Disappointed that the peak seemed be crazy short like 1.5 - 2 hours after that it was basically 5 more hours of minor distortions with no introspectiveness which was kind of boring for me but I'm sure would still be interesting for a novice tripper

Also had a buddy go for 400ug and was crazy visual intense for him. I wonder what the cause is for such a long tolerance reset, it has a hefty cross tolerance with the other lysergamides as well. The day after I took 200ug of AL, I tried 300ug of 1P thinking it would have to do something because I felt absolutely nothing from the 200, ended up feeling like a micro dose at best. I wonder how long it will be for my tolerance to baseline.

I've got a couple questions about AL-LAD, so anyone feel free to chip in (or not ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png))


I've tried LSZ @ 75, 150 and 225 ug. A complete bust. Blotters were either weakly laid, degraded (doubtful considering how I stored them) or my body just didn't take to it. 1P-LSD from 25-200 ug (tolerable at all doses, although stomach felt a bit weirdish when I first tried it in July/15....not so now). Eth-LAD once at 100 ug. That kind of snuck up on me. I wasn't expecting much, and for the first 60 minutes it was that - nothing. Then it clicked in suddenly like I've found Salvia to do when I used that.


So I've managed to obtain some 150 ug doses of AL-LAD and was intending on taking 150 ug after a 6 week break from any Lysergamides. Is that a reasonable amount of time for a tolerance reset?


Last question - how stimulating mentally is this? With 1P-LSD I was easily able to stay awake , stretching a Friday working day out to 24 hours total wake time (waking up at 6:30 am, going to work, coming home and then dropping at 6:30 pm). Actually I found it to be close to ideal for dealing with hypersomnia. When I first tried 1P-LSD I didn't like the fact that I couldn't sleep on it; and now I rather welcome it because I end up getting more done, even if it is pointless stuff.


thanks for any information, tips or pointers.


Tom


[Oh yeah....how is the overall appetite on this?]

If you've taken 1P higher dosage than Al-Lad I'd say you'll find the 150ug underwhelming.  However, of course to be on the safe side go for it but I wouldn't expect the full treats of what AL can give you at that if you have prior experience with the others.  Mentally it's very stimulating!  Very euphoric with lots of visuals!  You'll be imaging futuristic worlds in 3D neon colour geometry closed eyes.  Saying that it is much shorter than the others - give or take 3-4 hours.  For me, I normally come down around 7 hours and can sleep no problem after that.  It's not as draining as LSD either so you should be good to choose whether you want to call it a night or keep doing what you're doing.  I've taken it at parties for 12-15 hours and been fine to stay on!  Appetite wise, thinking of it, I've never eaten anything substantial whilst on AL.  However, the odd fruit or sweet goes down a treat of course!


Come up time for me takes about 2 hours, sometimes even 3 to fully peak.  It really is a gem of a chem.  Very positive and fun, and music for me is just as good as it's big brother (in higher doses).

I've got a quick question, I received my AL-LAD blotters and they're very small, smaller in comparison to ETH-LAD, 1P-LSD, or ALD-52 blotters, they came from the same vendor, which I trust, but I just thought it was odd.


Also, unlike the aforementioned chemicals, these contain no printings with the chemicals name on it, they are blue and have cartoon pictures of hotdogs, or hamburgers printed on them.


Anyone who had the same blotters, or knows why they are smaller?

About a 3th smaller I assume.

For immoral redistribution reasons, I'd presume? Not sure if they are similarly sized to street tabs of LSD, but that seems like a logical thing. Otherwise the vendor is just getting the blotter from a different source. The vendor who started distributing this chemical doesn't carry this anymore in blotter form, at least, so might be a different person put in on a different paper. 


Don't think anyone can help you much further than this, have you tried talking to the vendor? The RC scene is situated in such a way that customer service is very important and they would be glad to help probably.

Probably.

It's AL-LAD, I don't doubt it for a second.

He's a stand up guy and tests all his products at Energy Control before selling, but his previous products are all labeled with the chemical's name, that's why I asked if anyone has seen these before.

Yeah that naming thing was policy by the original source, I think. Any more and we'll be braking BL-law, so let's not do that.

Haven't taken AL-LAD in a month but had minor tolerance to other psychs, tried to take 250ug of AL-LAD last night which 250ug of LSD would of rocked me, the AL had zero effect again. This stuff has crazy cross tolerance. I'm gonna wait 2 weeks and take 450. Hopefully it does something.

250ug is pretty much a minimum dose for me anyways, this one starts being good around 400ug for me. Much less potent than LSD, though the dosage curve is a bit more steep.

@BlueMerlin: I have the same blotters you are mentioning. I tested one (100ug) and thought it tasted a bit bitter, but I have never tested AL-LAD before, only read that it's supposed to be tasteless. Have you tested it yet?

No bitterness at all for me, completely tasteless, if they are blue with cartoon hotdogs on them then I guess you just imagined the bitterness.


I'm not sure if I really like this one though, I get a lot of jaw clenching, very annoying, makes me much more tense than regular LSD.

Does anyone else notice a unique and weird tolerance with this one? For some reason it's just really hard for me to trip on, even waiting a week or 2 with no psychedelics and other people experience not too much tolerance. It's my favorite but sadly looks like can only be used once a month at most for me, cross tolerance to all other psychedelics as well. Just trying to save people the wasted product and time I experienced, I waited 11 days after trying ETH-LAD took 200ug of AL with zero effect, cross tolerance with mush, normal LSD as well very heavy, along with having its own tolerance of 2-3 weeks, where as normal L you could trip weekly if you wanted.

For what it's worth - 


April 22 - 150 ug Al-LAD after a complete 8 week break. Minimal effects, but possibly due to being 'in transit' to me ~34 days. May have been subject to temperatures of 30C for days at a time (a complete guess)


April 29 - 75 ug Al-LAD + 100 ug Eth-LAD (also 34 day transit). Very strong effects, almost a bit too much. So either Eth-LAD not affected by  transit, synregism between the two or I just respond weakly to Al-LAD. Who knows


May 6th - 300 ug Al-LAD from a new shipment that was only 13 days in transit. I was a bit hesitant because this was the largest Lysergamide dose I've taken; but I wanted to find out if the first shipment might have been degraded or if I had a tolerance at all. No conclusions about degradation, but I can easily say I've got no tolerance/cross tolerance at least within a 2 week/3 use period. I actually found this hellishly strong. Maybe with no tolerance it would have been too much? Hunger was stimulated, much more so than on any other lysergamide, I ended up cooking a burger 4 hours into the trip (couldn't stop laughing because I kept saying to the burger 'I win you lose'). Alcohol consumption was moderate; 3 beer and 1 cider


So there ya have it. I seem to have about a 1 week reset.


May 13rth - 300 ug Al-LAD Absolutely no tolerance. It actually seems a bit stronger upon subsequent use. I was expecting a big tolerance for using the same amount 2-3 weeks in a row, but got thrown for a loop when it was stronger.

What's the dose response curve like on this?  While I haven't read through the whole big and dandy, I've read quite a few pages without finding a good answer.  I've taken 300 ug, which gave decent visuals, but not much mental effects.  I was thinking of doing 600 ug next time, but wondering if it's too much of a jump.  Going up by a smaller amount might be sensible, but risks wasting material and time if it's going to be another underwhelming trip.  Reports seem to indicate that this is pretty forgiving, and I'm OK with being a bit overwhelmed, if that's even possible.

I find 450 a lot stronger and better than 300ug.  I haven't tried 600 but the jump is a lot between 300 and 450.

All the lysergamides can be stored for quite a long time this way, assuming they're properly sealed from air.  Not sure exactly how long but you're not in danger of them degrading anytime soon.

Aah, many thanks, Xorkoth. Then I misunderstood. I thought I'd have to take my blotters all at once in the next days, before the AL-LAD degrades into something else. :D


As you have experience with both : Could you perhaps briefly compare the effects of this to those of 2c-e ? I just take 2c-e as reference, as it is the last (and one of the serious) psychedelic I've consumed and never had any lysergamide (I know I'm a virgin by Steve Job's definition).


And in general, are there any serious differences between the effects of the lysergic acid RCs ?

^^^^ This. I've been taking Al-LAD once a week for ~2 months, slowly increasing the doses. Once I started doing 300 ug, subsequent trips became stronger, almost as if there was a catalytic or inductive effect.


I finished off my stash with a 375 ug trip, and it was much stronger than a 300 ug trip. Just a guess, but most people will probably have slightly different dose response curves depending on physiology, weight, age, overall health, etc. 375 ug wasn't (for me) uncomfortable, but I did get 'day after' nausea.


Mental effects? Phenomenal anti-depressant activity, wild chaotic thoughts that jump all over the place and an utter inability to do anything (once I'd started something, I'd immediately think of something else and have my attention diverted to or drawn by that).


I did become rather disgusted by the amount of food that I ate. I'm not sure that I was actually hungry (not like with MJ where I would be ravenous), but I kept eating because of the 'novelty' of trying new bits of food.

Hmm, 2C-E and lysergamides are quite different.  In general I find 2C-E to be quite neutral in character, and very intensely psychedelic to all my senses and my thoughts.  2C-E is way stronger than AL-LAD and a more powerful psychedelic.  AL-LAD is, for me, a euphoric, giggly state of mind, with interesting visuals quite distinct from LSD or anything else I've tried, with interesting and amusing effects on thought.  


As for the differences between LSD analogues, I find 1p-LSD and ALD-52 to be fairly indistinguishable from LSD, but ETH-LAD and AL-LAD are both distinct, unique chemicals that are substantially different enough from LSD to make them all worthwhile for different reasons.  AL-LAD is the most different I think, and also the most euphoric.

I really like AL-LAD though.  I have also read of some people having really deep experiences on both AL-LAD and 4-HO-MET (separately I mean), even though both of them seem rather shallow to me.  ETH-LAD on the other hand is quite psychedelic.

I've got some AL-LAD 150ug tabs from a reputable vendor that I've been wanting to try out. My next "time" I have that would suit taking any substance would be next week when I'll be going clubbing with some friends which would include drinking as well. Would it be a bad idea to take 150ug prior to clubbing having not experimented with AL-LAD prior? I'm mainly concerned with acting like a fool/being nonsensical but I'm also wanting to experience "some" visuals and am afraid that too low of a dose(75ug or 100ug) will be underwhelming?  I've experimented with 4-aco-dmt a nice bit and I have done a medium dose of nbomes so its certainly not my first experience with psychs but will be my first in such a busy environment. Generally speaking I manage to compose myself fairly well.

Fwiw I'm about 150lbs/5ft9 . Also curious if eating prior will have an effect, although I don't figure that it would since it is active orally?

Taking stuff orally actually does get dramatically affected by food in the stomach.  However lysergamides like AL-LAD are actually absorbed sublingually/buccally (through the mucous membranes in the mouth), if you hold the tab in your mouth, so it shouldn't matter.

I've taken a single 150 µg tab in a club setting - totally manageable and nicely euphoric. You should be able to remain well-grounded. Not sure how alcohol would interact with it.

I do however find that AL-LAD makes my body feel weird/alien, which doesn't make for the best dancing (unlike LSD).

2 tabs, I'm not sure how many mics, I think 100 each, didn't produce any CEV at all for me, OEV were limited to color enhancement and some very mild breathing.Which is strange for me, I'm usually a lot more sensitive to LSD.


But the headspace was interesting, no deep introspective thinking, but very positive analytical and clear minded.


Bodyload was a bit confusing, it puts me in a state between activity and passivity, quite restless and indecisive at times.3


Again lots of jaw clenching, and I'm taking magnesium this time, didn't really help, I think I'll try L-Tyrosine next time.

L-Tyrosine is a dopamine precursor. It will just amplfiy the mentioned side effects or did I miss something ? Did you mean L-Arginine ?

Some more research with this compound has been published a couple of weeks ago: [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/dta.1985/abstract](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/dta.1985/abstract), confirming the lesser potency of this compound (relative to LSD) amongst other things (LSZ is equally potent to LSD).

LSZ  is equally potent as LSD perhaps in its ability to induce mice into twitching their hairy little heads. It certainly is not equipotent to LSD in man. It's also a very different experience than LSD, which calls into question the  whole "which one is more potent" debate - how exactly do you compare potency across two different kinds of drug experiences?

Lysergamides aren't that much different from each other structurally, and I'd be able to tell if I was on any type of one, they have a certain feel and characteristic, lysergic acid in general. I'd say the potency is fairly easy to differentiate between the main ones, AL-LAD is the weakest, 1P is near identical, ETH is the strongest comparitively to LSD. Because they are all dosed in micrograms, 100 micrograms of each one has a different intensity and effect. Though the experience and effects are altered, it still resembles lysergic acid and you can make a comparison based on how the same unit of dosage matches a certain intensity. 


I haven't tried AL-LAD since my last post on here, but I remember clearly the first time I tried it was stronger and better than my trials after. Im going in for 250ug with no psychedelic tolerance, it usually takes me 2 hours to feel the first effects and 3 hours to even start tripping on this one anyway.

Yeah LSZ is weak and the worst of the bunch - LSM was better but that seems to have died a death. AL-LAD was stronger than LSD in prehuman trials if I remember. As for AL-LAD being shallow - Fab as it is I would go with that to a degree, there is a less intellectual component contrasted with LSD but I have still had very interesting and deep trips; it’s a different area. I guess LSDs depth doesn’t guarentee depth and the opposite is true for AL-LAD

Ah, gotcha.  The same is true with 1p-LSD... according to lab experiments with rats, by checking the head twitch response, they estimated 1p-LSD to be 30% the potency of LSD.  In my opinion measuring physical responses in rats and other animals is no way to determine subjective potency in humans.

I thought I'd chime in here about SSRIs and AL-LAD because I scoured around the internet for a month and found no info other than SSRIs reduce the effect of LSD. So anyways I've recently been put on 20mg citalopram for insomnia and mood, I've found it not very beneficial for me but am still weening down. Last weekend at a mountain festival I went for 300 Mocs and it hit me harder than normal almost lol. Just thought I'd note that ymmv. TR to come

300ug of this stuff was terribly disappointing. Not even close to the awesomeness that is 200ug 1p-LSD.

After going through tons of AL-LAD, I can tell you that it is not as potent as LSD, aside from all the other things it does not share with LSD. I also found that AL doesn't really shine, for me, until you go above 600ug. I wouldn't even bother with less if I had little to no tolerance. If I DID have a tolerance built up, I'd shoot more for like 750-900mics for a real experience. But that's just me, and I don't recommend those doses for others, of course. It also seems to have a wicked cross-tolerance with other psychs, and you are better served by waiting 2 to 4 weeks to reset tolerance with AL.

Yea. I tried it only once at 150ug.  I've got lots of experience with LSD25 which I never mix with other substances - I suppose I'm a sort of purist (I love the sharpness and clarity of the experience).


Anyway, I found my one experience of AL-LAD very disappointing.  The words that came to mind to describe it were "mongy acid".  I lacked the mental and physical lift (energy) that L25 invariably gives me. Set and setting were good; the dose was from a reputable vendor with previous good reports for the substance.  It seemed to live up to the reports but then the reports I read were that it was, on its own, lacklustre.

I am beginning to wonder if that AL lad is degrading. It was made at least 2 years ago. I think the powder is good but the blotters are losing some power. 

I say this because when this first hot the scene everyone loved it. Raved about it. I remember after the first batch was gone how many people were waiting for more. 

And back then no body ever mentioned having to past 600ugs to trip. Seems like 300ugs back in 2013 was plenty enough for most. Shulgin did say I think about AL LAD that it degrades quickly in solution. It's not in solution just blotters. And they were probably laid years ago. 

Thank my humble opinion.

yeah my first trial with al-lad was 300ug in liquid form from the very first batch. I was completely shocked by the intensity of the visuals and easy going headspace, it was my go to psychedelic for about a year as i wasnt after the life changing aspects of LSD anymore. But the last few times ive tried it the visuals where far less intense so maybe its like MDMA in that the first time cant be beat for a lot of people. Either that or it does degrade after a few years although my tabs stayed good for over a year or more and not always stored in ideal conditions but the visuals never matched that first time.

You'll only get a stimulant effect, very mild as well, even 100 produced no more than a stimulant effect.


I think you can just start with 100.

200 feels somewhat like 40-50ug LSD headspace without visual distortions for me.

I took about 25µg at an outdoor music festival last year (or was it 35µg? I forget), expecting it to be almost unnoticeable. I was surprised to find it a little bit trippy, some music and visual enhancement for sure. I wouldn't call it stimulating at all, maybe a bit wiring and calming at the same time. I guess stimulants can be like that too though.


It was nice!

I did not take it, yet. I think I'll take a low, but not micro dose for recreation, soon, as MDing (microdosing) psychedelics did not work out that well in the past for me. Whereas MDing tryptamines was a total waste (dysphoric and agitated) vs. phenetylamines were more suitable (minor stimulation but not really utilizable/enjoyable either).


But AFAIK LSD (and perhaps 2c-d?) is the most decent MDing tool. Correct me if I'm wrong. That is why I considered to give MDing AL-LAD a try.

Long term I don't know, mushrooms did have a great effect in the 2 month or so daily microdose trial I had.


Microdosing lysergamids have a stimulant effect, completely different to what mushrooms did, you could test your personal preference.


AL-LAD is not very potent dose for dose so it's probably not the most suited for microdosing, 50ug is probably the absolute minimum as microdosing is considered.

I recently combined a low/medium dose of Eticyclidone (15 mg) with a microdose of AL-LAD (~35 ug, a quarter of a blotter, that is supposed to have 150 ug on it) and I observed, that it certainly added a rather distinct compassionate quality to the otherwise cold and mainly physical effects of that particular dissociative.


So while the effects of a microdose of AL-LAD that low - I must add that I did not have any tolerance to 5ht2x-agonists and a low/no tolerance to NMDA-antagonists - might not be perceivable on its own, they can add a serotonergic component to drugs, that lack effects in that regard, without being the central source of effects for the experience.


No negative side effects were noted.

I should bump this. I have no idea how this got down at the bottom of the second page.


I remain amazed our community has these opportunities with lysergamides. These wonderful chemicals are vastly safer than the other NBOMe, DOX, ect. Previously the possibility of exotic lysergamides readily available was unimaginable. While these are available I should probably obtain some.


Could I have an idea of the blotter designs this is available in?

^There's a pic of the blotter on the first page. I've been researching this one for over a year, and I must say I can get a great short-lived trip out of it at 300-450ug, but it never really gets mentally deep and the come-down seems to happen very quickly. I don't know if I'd want to go much higher than 450-600ug because of body load, but it'd would probably be fine at higher doses. Al-lad is an extremely forgiving lysergamide imo. Also combo'd well with 2f-dck in my one experience fwiw.

Ok I have a question.  I got that exact blotter art but it was NOT for AL-LAD it was for ALD-52. 


But I did order AL-LAD and the blotter art looked like a mini hundred dollar bill.  Unfortunately I have ate a good amount of them, and only have 6 left. So I am going to try take a picture and post in a minute of what my "AL-LAD" looks like. I trust my vendor very much. Or I did anyways... Haha. jk

To be totally honest, I wouldn't know AL-LAD from ALD-52. Like I wouldn't know the difference in how one should feel on one or the other.. I have little experience with LSD/Acid and phens. 

I am more experienced with tryptamines. I have never done "real" LSD/acid (except one time about 15 years ago, when I was about 14 years old and that experiences is very blurry and unclear in my mind and can't remember a lot of it. The only thing I remember is one minute was having great fun, the next I was terrified, scared and out of my mind. 


Anyways so did anyone else get this blotter art for AL-LAD or was yours the hundred dollar bill print.

Or did anyone get that blotter art and it was for ALD-52

The darn thing is so small with only 6 tabs left. But you can kinda see the art. It looks like a one 

hundred dollar bill


thats the AL-LAD I got. And it is only 100mcg

btw- that's a really bad picture. I took with iPhone  and tried to edit the color so it looked more defined. It looks fucked up. By its on a blotter, and the blotter art is a 100 dollar bill...

I dont get the purpose behind this print. I would never lay somthing as remarkable, and loving as lsd or ANY lysergamine, on a print that has the sum of all evil on it the mighty dollar bill. 

Its crazy how somtimes the print on the lsd effects the nature of the trip. 

I mean at least do what hippys did in the 60s and make blotter art. If you call that art you are a moron, life is not all about how much $$ you have its about how you choose to live it.

300 to 400ugs is a good starting point should be enough to get you somewhere. Depending on if you have any tolerance. Al lad is pretty damn boring below 300ugs imho.

 Usually most people, at least latley on this thread have been dosing all the way up to 600ugs and still dont get floored. Its a wierd one with its cross tolerance and how long that tolerance takes to subside.

I don't know, I also find the dosage tricky with this one. At 300 ug I start tripping too hard, extreme ego dissolution, confusing headspace, fractals and colors overtake my visual field... I mean is awesome, but my last trip with it was at 225 ug and I think I ended up enjoying it more, I felt more in control and present in my trip while still having worthwhile effects, whereas in my 300 ug experiments I just felt run over by the experience, with no chance to interact with it. 


Anyway, I'm conscious that my response is rather atypical. Most people on the web are saying that at 300 ug this one just starts feeling psychedelic at all. But my point is that dosage with this one seem to have extreme individual variability, or at least there's a couple of people out there that seem to be specially sensitive to it (Like me!), while others are very hard-headed toward lysergamides in general. I haven't noticed being specially sensitive to any other substance, and I try to keep my tolerance low, but I still trip more or less once a month though. 


So in the end, the old mantra of "Titrate your doses up slowly" seems to be, like always, the way to go if you want to find the sweetspot. But as a sidenote, I think if you overshoot it with this one, it's not too bad. I haven't had a negative experience with it. Even when the headspace gets confusing at higher doses, it's not anxiogenic at all. Certainly the most forgiving lysergamide out there.

I agree 300 could be too much but it deff seems 150ugs is really underwhelming to the point you dont even get to expierence the true nature of this lysergamine. Seems like 300ugs is most peoples starting point. 

    But isnt "Titrating your doses up slowly"  a big no no for lysergamines? I mean if you start 1 week at 150 then wait a few weeks and try 300 i understand that rhetoric and its the best way imho to find your "sweet spot". But really with lsd you gotta dose it within a hour of first ingesting it. Otherwise it doesnt really boost your trip at all due to how fast a tolerance is developed. If you take 150 wait for it to kick in then take more you are really just prolonging it right, not increasing its effects?

But you are dead on about it being forgiving you can guide yourself and your psyche pretty easy on this one and then its over in 8 hours. 

Too expensive for me to justify buying anymore. Considering i need 3 tabs at least to get where I WANT TO BE. One day someone will make 200 ug blots for the same price as 150s cuz there is a shit load of al lad left still.

HAPPY TRAILS!,

My good friend trips hard off 150ug, generally he takes a half tab (75ug) with AL-LAD.  Then again he also takes like 8-10mg for 4-sub-tryptamines, 15mg for 2C-B, etc.  He's just really sensitive to everything.  That would be nice. :D

Price is the one thing that keeps me from ordering those in bulk. For the price of 100 blotters of whatever legal lysergamide I can buy double the ammount of decent LSD, and beeing the effects of those new lysergamides really virtually identical to LSD, I don't see why stock those over the classic, apart than for crossing some weid substances from our psychonaut to-do lists...

Agree, for me 150 ug is pretty underwhelming and the 300 ug borders on being too much. Still enjoyable though, but I don't really see the point to push it further that point. 


And yeah, by titrating up I meant several different instances. Dosing a couple of hours latter it's a waste, for the reasons you already said.

Tried 225ug today, two of the standard, gray-white name and chemical structure blotters. About 1 hour in, I felt a steady peripheral stimulation kick in, but nothing developed beyond that. No visuals, no thought changes, absolutely nothing aside from some vague body tension. 


The tabs arrived 4 months ago, and I've been keeping them in their original plastic baggie, away from light but with otherwise no special protection. AC runs fine here; although it certainly got hot outside, temperatures in my room never got much above 23C or so, and humidity was reasonably low as well.


I can't imagine they would degrade that quickly, but I have no one else I could offer these to, so who knows. I haven't tripped in 4 months; took a 25mg 4-HO-MET dose in late April and had a wonderful experience, but since then, I've been too busy to set aside time to trip until now.


Still feeling fairly wired, but other than that, well, nothing. Disappointed.


Edit: Made the original post about 2 hours after dosing. At the 3hr mark, I finally noticed a transition; the tension relaxed a bit and gave way to a mild, lightly pleasant body high, with some faint shimmering and waving of patterned surfaces, and slightly more saturated colors. But it really wasn't much at all, comparable to what I saw on 10mg or so 4-HO-MET. At about 5 hours I get a sudden surge in anxiety and looping thoughts, and nearly have a panic attack; thankfully I was able to calm myself down over the next hour. Ended up taking 2mg etizolam at 6 hours to kill the anxiety and lingering body tension. 


The whole experience was just weird compared to the glowing reports I've seen elsewhere. Maybe lysergamides just aren't for me.

I tried 150ug for the first time and for me personally there were zero visuals and overall it was very underwhelming but im still very interested. It was obviously active, but very strange. I nodded off a couple times. Not very stimulated at all but from the bodyload and visuals I feel like I should double it next time and that should be perfect. Probably going to try again in a week or two.

Yeah many people, myself included, find 150ug to be threshold.  It's less potent than the other lysergamides.  I like 300ug, but it's also underwhelming.  I find it gets interesting at 450ug but still primarily recreational.  Quite euphoric and visual though, with tons of laughter and fun, even though I've never had anything resembling a profound experience from it.  I think of AL-LAD as the 2C-B of lysergamides.  Not very potent or profound, but quite euphoric and visual when you take enough.

I haven't had AL-LAD since it first came out in 2013 and I have a small lot stashed away for the future. The grey/white blotter style with name and molecule.


I remember eating 2 tabs, 300ug on an empty stomach with no tolerance and it felt so overwhelming. Within 20 minutes I started having visuals and 1 hour later I was unable to see across my living room. 

Everything exploded in neon colors and complex visuals I've never seen before. My whole house turned into another world and it was very hard to navigate around. When I closed my eyes I had visuals synergize with the music and It felt so blissfully euphoric.


At some point I lost track of time and reality and was "away" for like 1 hour.

The whole experience was over in a short period of time and come down felt easy and I was able to sleep 13-14 hours after ingestion with no help.


For me it sounds like you guys are getting bunk, underdosed AL-LAD or maybe have a very high tolerance.


I am very keen to dig into my old stash just to try and see if I get the same result  as in 2013. 


My blotters aren't stored in the best conditions. Not air sealed and in a warm, damp basement. I Hope they haven't degraded too much.

Mine came from the same presumed source (though I have crystals, not blotter), and I mirror Xorxoth's dose-range down to the ng. I guess this one does vary a lot person-to-person, because I just can't seem to get the dose right. Tried 240ug for the newcomers and some were having a great experience, while others didn't feel much.

I've got 1.5 tabs of the original go around left. I always found 1 to be satisfying.  My wife got us tickets to see dark side of the moon performed live in October, so I know exactly how I'm going to use them. 


Unless it doesn't play well with food. Thoughts?

I have the same blotters.  The original 150ug ones with the molecule on them.  People often jump right to bunk/underdosed when others' experiences don't match their own, but the real answer is that everyone is affected differently.  Many people find AL-LAD to be much less potent than LSD, in fact so did Shulgin.  But some, like you, find it to be quite potent and strong.  It's just like how some people require 50+mg of 2C-T-7 to properly trip, while others have powerful trips at 20mg.  Differences in metabolism, enzymes, etc can account for a wide variance in effects.

Back when I only tripped 1-2 times per year, 150ug was great but I've never had it last longer than 6 maybe 7 hours. It has an abrupt drop off too, one second your tripping then your suddenly your down. I don't know what dude above is talking about 13-14 hours, shit!

There's *something* about that first batch...I don't know what it is, but that batch is blessed with energy that I did not detect in subsequent iterations.

There were a couple of batches of the 150ug name/molecule blotters, though. Unless you have been following/ordering AL-LAD since the moment it first became available, it's going to be difficult to determine which batch do your blotters come from.

Are the same pre-conditions required before consuming this substance as with LSD, i.e. :


- not being hungover

- set and setting have to be suitable

- having a lot of time


? Or is this substance on the same harmlessness-class as 2c-c,4-Ho-MET ?

IME for non-heroic doses with 2c-c and 4-Ho-MET the danger goes asymptotically to zero. Set and Setting are negligible prerequisites.

so you are saying that your mental contents and psychological disposition at the time you trip do not contribute to the psychedelic sequences that occur?

To stay on topic. A good dose of AL-LAD (300ug+) depending on your sensitivity to psychedelics, will need much greater care for set and setting than either 2C-C or 4-HO-MET would but still not as much care for set and setting if you were to be dropping a good dose of LSD.

Not if I stay below 30mg insufflated/50mg orally for 2c-c or 20mg 4-HO-MET. I tried those in pretty fucked up set/settings and did not experience bad outcomes. Though 2c-c is in a class of its own in that regard, as 4-HO-MET can be too stimulating for some situations.


Sorry for off-topic. Thanks for the opinion @sean107.

Hi guys, I'm hoping someone can tell me about muscle tension with AL-LAD. Any comments on overall stimulation, anxiety generation and sleep issues afterwards are much appreciated as well. 


Also, dumb question - can blotters be reliably cut in half etc., as in the dose is spread uniformly throughout the blotter? 


Thank you.

Tried this compound again at 450ug and was very unimpressed. No real visuals to speak of. Some tracers but that was about it. I was really disappointed because so many people have had amazing visuals with this one. I just may be one of the people that dont respond very well to it. Im going to try 1p-lsd or ALD-52 next time.

Yes, the blotters can be cut in half as, at least for the ones I've had that have the molecule and name printed on them, the sheets are soaked, leading to roughly uniform distribution.


I find AL-LAD to no more stimulating than LSD, or perhaps less so.  It also lasts shorter, only 4-6 hours with maybe 2 hours of residual, and a much more rapid ability to sleep than LSD.  I find it to be extremely warm and friendly, very euphoric with lots of laughs.  I can't imagine feeling anxiety from it, at the very beginning of the come-up, I get a grin and feel great.  To me, AL-LAD is the 2C-B of lysergamides.

I was really disappointed because so many people have had amazing visuals with this one. I just may be one of the people that dont respond very well to it. Im going to try 1p-lsd or ALD-52 next time.

I find it to be extremely warm and friendly, very euphoric with lots of laughs.  I can't imagine feeling anxiety from it, at the very beginning of the come-up, I get a grin and feel great.  To me, AL-LAD is the 2C-B of lysergamides.

I only have a small supply of AL-LAD so I don't want to waste it, but does anyone have experience with micro-dosing with this substance?

I have a bit of experience microdosing it. I found 20-25mg to be the sweet spot for me for the barely-perceptible-but-still-real tweak on a normal headspace. I found it to be very a useful tool at microdose levels! 


However if you only have a small supply and don't want to have to replenish it, I'd recommend you save it for actual trips where you get a more full appreciation for it's effects.

What did you find it useful for ? I ingested 35 (quarter blotter) micrograms on top of a medium dose of 2-oxo-PCE and it added a very emotional and pretty euphoric (for that dose) edge to the experience. Never microdosed solo. (In fact that microdosing combo was my one and only experience with al-lad ever).

Thanks for the report. That helps to estimate the consequences of microdosing AL-LAD (microdosing never worked for me solo, but I do not have much experience, tiny doses of 2c-e just made me agitated a bit and more alert perhaps).

Recently had an experience with a low dose AL-LAD (75 micrograms) + low dose 2-Oxo-PCE (15mg) at t+2h30min. It is now my goto-combo. A very functional insightful state was created. Reminded me of a time when I took spiritual practice very serious. AL-LAD seems to be a perfect fit for my purposes (it does not amplify chronic pain in low doses like many vasoconstricting substances and the duration is short). Pure bliss.

Did you use full doses of both or just half ones ? I like to have a rather clear mind, which was totally possible on a low dose combo. Not so sure about higher doses.

Remember any ones experience is just there own and they vary a lot - I find it at least as stimmy as LSD (just in a different way)and can be tense coming down - I also get more like 9-11hrs total off it - it is generally very easy mentally and very well worth trying either way

Do any AL-LAD blotters have a bitter, slightly metallic taste? I ordered some from a trusted vendor, though I did not test them. Anyway, I licked one and it was bitter. Far more so than LSD, but nothing too horrible. Is this normal?

maybe dirt from the handler's sweaty fingers, or maybe residue from the plastic packaging - if your tongue is not numbed by the contact, you are ok.

I recall a while ago there was some strawberry printed blotters sold as AL-LAD that actually contained an NBOMe ... That was years ago, though. Apart from that time, I don't think I've ever heard of AL-LAD being intentionally mislabeled. Maybe the bitter taste was just ink ?

Thanks everyone, I think it was just the ink. The blotters had more ink than I've ever used but the bitterness wasn't like pervasive or anything, plus being the idiot that I am, I took 3 and have no ill effects to speak of.

Go to the quick reply box at the bottom of the page and write your question/message.  Then click on the 3rd last icon on the menu bar at the top of the space for the reply. This will open up a dialogue box entitled "insert image".  In this box it will also say:


Add an Image from Url

There will be a single line width box for the URL.  Copy and paste your image URL into this box ([http://.](http://.)..........).  Hit "OK" and the image will be embedded in your message.  Then hit "send"

That should do the trick.

> It was at this point the doctors told me when I came in that my heart rate was at 210bpm, and said had I not come to the hospital that I could have very easily had a heart attack. The blood flowing to my internal organs was also incredibly restricted and could have caused organ failure had they not pumped me with something to ease blood flow and decrease restriction. The official diagnosis was “polysubstance abuse”. But I’m not sure. Would I have had the same reaction without the cocaine and weed? I really can’t be sure.

But if you read the TR, you can see that the 5 lines really didn't do anything much - so if it was bunk Coke then it may not even have been equivalent to one line of more potent Coke!  So the Coke may not have been such a significant factor - and weed is not known to cause vasoconstriction or really any untoward effect apart from possibly a panic attack.


This leaves AL-LAD on it's own as the possible culprit.  Curious indeed.  And very worrying for the TR poster.

Hmm... I had the exact same stomach ache once after taking al-lad (225ug or one and a half blotter, the ones with the name and the molecule printed on them). I've used al-lad six times, dosages ranging from 75 to 300, the other five times I was fine. I didn't notice any cardiovascular problems though.


The pain went away after two hours. It was excruciating but I kind of enjoyed it because it lead to some deep reflections on the nature of pain. At the time I had the habit of going cycling during the come-up/ first part of the trip, so I thought my bended posture was the culprit, being on a racing cycle and all.

I actually got a bad stomach ache from AL-LAD once too, at 450ug (which is the dose I prefer, 300ug or less seems weak to me), it felt like gas pain, but it wouldn't come out.  It was quite sharp, this pain, but it went away after I started moving around a lot.  Didn't ruin the trip at all but it was something to deal with for a while.

I'll just put a little TR out here.


I tried 150ug AL-LAD last week for the first time. It was my first trip around friends (I've always tripped solo) although I was still the only one tripping. We were just gonna drive an hour to a little scenic island with a conservatory, small aquarium and zoo and just chill out there.


I started getting the effects in about 30 minutes. After an hour or so of dropping we stopped for lunch. As with LSD (and it's also being mentioned in a few posts right before this), I got a pretty bloated stomach with this one. I couldn't eat much. Usually cannabis or ginger tea helps with that, but I had none. Thankfully, it wasn't more intense than 100ug LSD and manageable. The taste of food wasn't amplified as much as with LSD, but the smells were quite strong. I left my pakced sandwiches in the car and by the time we got back, I couldn't stand that smell because it felt so intense. I was having visuals at par with 150+ug of LSD, but almost no headspace to speak off. It was just like a little light show.


And it stayed that way. I felt a bit out of sorts, as if I wasn't completely there, but otherwise was as good as sober as I browsed through the exhibits. Later on, we messed around a little golf at a driving range. My first time and even though I failed to connect the club with the ball in my first few attempts, I got pretty good at sending the ball far. All I'd hoped for with my first time. We also did a little putting practice and that was fun too. I never thought I'd like golf, but everything was coming together so nicely. The weather was perfect, so was the chemical in my head, and I had friends around! I've never laughed so much on a trip. Most importantly, they were having a good time too. That had me somewhat confused. I felt I was having this amazing time only because of the AL-LAD, but that may not be completely true. I'm sure it significantly amplified that joy though and made it easy for me to immerse myself in the activities.


After that we just sat around with many geese and ducks and watched the sunset. After returning to the apartment, I had a fuckton of cannabis with lots of different people. From having lived an entire year almost alone, this was a huge change. Even though I had some anxiety during all that, I could ignore that and focus on interacting with new people. By this time, weed had given rise to it's own little headspace and like with all psychedelics it synergized perfectly with this one too. My thoughts became more analytical and I suddenly found myself wishing to become an observer in this drama. Classic cannabis + psych depersonalization.


By the time for dinner, cannabis had helped with the gas and I was hungry. I'd had too much though, and was a little scared to eat a lot for fear of laying unnecessary stress on the GI tract. Still, I had a decent dinner at an Italian restaurant. It was a party of sorts and there were 20+ people on the table. Luckily, I found the corner spot and could inconspicuously phase out. I loved the flow of thought in my head throughout the wait for food. At times I would get this desire to interact a little with others and try a bit. Never got the conversation anywhere, but I never felt anxious, ashamed or guilty about it. Another friend was also about as high as me minus the AL-LAD and was pretty much "not present" at the table. I could feel that others who were all sober, did not seem pleased with our inebriated states. That annoyed me a little, but again, unlike LSD, AL-LAD did not take me deep into the implications of their behaviour. Just had me wishing that I could explain them the positives of drug use.


The time for that would soon come though. After dinner we played a little poker and before retiring, the topic of drugs came up. Me being the only one experienced with the illegal variants was being bombarded with questions. I showed them how I kept a log of all my drug use and how I thought it can be positively integrated in life if used responsibly. At the end of all that, I felt somewhat satisfied for having adequately responded to their negative reactions to drug use. I'm not sure about it, but I felt good at having shared knowledge about something that has been blanketed in lies and false propaganda. I really don't know if all this interaction would've been possible on LSD or shrooms. They don't let me wander outside my head for long, but again, I don't have any experience using them in social situations.


Overall, I loved this one too (what haven't I loved so far?). I still have 4x150ug AL-LAD left. I find most dosages listed here to be pretty high (srsly, you guys feel nothing on 150ug AL-LAD? How?), but I still want to go for a 300ug trip. I'd do 225 before that though and if that feels too much (like 250ug LSD was more than what I needed) then I'd step down and just enjoy the gentler effects.


Anyway, this was all I learned from AL-LAD at 150ug. Colourful and visual, gas build up, very chilled out headspace, subtle social push, synergy with cannabis and no mental burden.

Thanks for sharing. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  Sounds like you don't have anyone to trip with and you hang around a lot of non drug-users.  That's kind of a bummer (would be to me anyway) but kudos on handling it well.

I don't hang around anyone to be more accurate. For this little trip, I was on a little vacation at one my friends place and all these other non drug users were his friends. My drug friendly friends are in another country (although one of them just got here and I plan on doing a 4-HO-MiPT experiment with him while he does MDMA for the first time).


Around these new people, it was somewhat difficult handling their obvious judging looks and condescending opinions, but that just motivated me to be better. I would like people to form a positive opinion for the social momentum to shift towards acceptable drug use and there is no other way to do it than interacting with them under the influence. I would consider it a success if I sowed the seeds of doubt for the drug propaganda they've been brain washed with since childhood, in at least a couple of them.


And sorry for digressing. None of this has anything to do with AL-LAD. So let me get a couple questions for you.


1. Given that you need a high dose to feel the effects, do you not even get any visuals at 150ug?


2. Does 300 or 450ug come with the headspace of a comparable dose of LSD or is it still predominantly visual?


Thanks!

I do not get any visuals from 150ug of AL-LAD, that dose feels nice but it's threshold, I don't feel substantially altered (compared to the same dose of LSD/ALD-52 where I am definitely tripping at that dose with some visuals).  At 300ug I get light visuals but it still doesn't get me all the way there,  At 450ug (the highest dose I've tried, done it multiple times), I get strong visuals (of a very different nature than LSD) and a unique headspace.  It is not deep like LSD, but it's still powerful.  I feel a great sense of hilarity at everything and communicating is somewhat difficult yet fun.  Coincidences seem to be magnified, but there is no spiritual depth to it or particularly useful insights.  It's more or less just a lot of fun, extremely euphoric (to a greater degree than LSD) and full of laughter.  I like it a lot but I wouldn't use AL-LAD to try to have a deep trip, for me it's a social thing.

Hello ! Just for those interrested : few years ago there was a debate  about a second batch of al-lad being weaker than the first one, blotters  not as potent... The vendor always claimed it was the same and accused  tolerance, set and setting, ith analysis at hand. I myself have a bit of  different batchs, dispose of many pychs, so I kind of forgot the 25  150mc al-lad blots I have from the very beginning of it. I recently  wanted to try some again, and took 1/4. This was one of the most intense  trip of my life, and there have been many many, I could not count them :  this time, insane visual and auditory effect, confusion, ago loss,  ++++, and eventually paranoia... from what I thought to be about 37.5mc  of the mollecule, which seems impossible to me. There might have been  set and seting as well, but not so much ! I nsist on the fact that I'm  very very used to all the lyzergamides recently accessible to us, at  micro/normal/high doses. Those blotters seem wird, greyis and completly  black on one side of the page (including on the 1/4 I took). Notice that  the row material in powder/crystal form is greyish/black... The vendor  had my complete trust, and I still trust him. but I was confident that  blotters laid at such a factory level would be the most consistently  dosed. I was wrong I must admit now... So coming back to the debate : I  think the second batch of blotters was not underdosed, but rather that  the first one was really but not consistently overdosed. I would have  never thought that one of my most intense trip would come out of 1/4 of a  4 years old blotter, off a chemical I'm very acquainted to... Sorry for  my porr english...

Nice post  emilium.  A good reminder that the idea that a "legitimate in another country" laboratory should be producing more reliable and accurate dosing does not necessarily hold true. There have been many "illegal" acid producers  who have a sense of fairness when creating the substance. Just part of the risk inherent in all production processes - it's happened with lemonade, cooking oils, etc., etc.  At least the safety profile is good!

Took 1 blotter rated at 150mcg of AL-LAD along with about a third of a  100mcg of ETH-LAD yesterday with my girlfriend (she took 75mcg, half a  tab of AL-LAD) and was very pleasantly surprised that the trip was very  visual and quite deep for AL-LAD. Had all three isomers (METH, AL and  ETH LADS) on papers sitting in the baggie for about couple of months, I  precut them in halves for easier dosages for camping trips, there were  only couple of them left in there.


Subjects: 170Lbs male with about 10 years of extensive psychoactives  research which includes: DMT, Mushrooms, 4-Aco-DMT, 4-Aco-MET,  4-HO-MiPT, 4-HO-DPT, LSD, AL-LAD, ETH-LAD, Mescaline, Allylescaline,  Methallylescaline, 2C-P, bk-2C-B, MDMA, Amanitas, Salvia, Amphetamines  and other stims. Previous trip was on 20mg 4-Aco-DET about a week ago.  My girlfriend is about 120Lbs with a lot less experience and with a lot  less tolerance to serotonergic psychedelics. We ate a breakfast muffins  with cheese and egg and had coffee about two hours prior the experience.


Set & Setting: Late night (we both work night shifts and it was our day off together) in a little busy moods.

We have both preloaded with 500mg Phenibut and I also took a gram of Piracetam.


T=00:00 - Took tabs and decided to put on the movie "Being John Malkovich".


T+00:30 - We both agree that there is an activity going on already.  Colors are more vivid and there is a characteristic AL-LAD gigglyness,  body becomes feeling lighter.


T+01:00 - An hour into the experience and I'm seeing slight visual  trails, webs of light and my brain is starting to have the warm energy I  usually get from lysergamides. The movie at this point is very funny  and we're laughing our asses off!..![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

 I start the fireplace in the living room and it's glow producing very  nice sparkly visuals. Time as a concept slowly dissolving. Some cannabis  smoked.


T+01:40 - We have a conversation, smoked some more cannabis, got even higher! ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

We  look at each other and as we are we start realizing that we are alive,  that we are extremely complex organic living beings, infinitely complex  chemically balanced creatures with consciousness, that we are right  here, right now, sitting next to each other and that realization fills  us both with such emotional charge, we both burst in tears. At this  point we just closed our eyes and were sitting forehead to forehead,  just listening to the crackling fireplace and each others thoughts. I've  never experienced telepathy on anything but classic LSD but this time  it was definite. We both were able to produce beautiful colorful moving  aztec-type of CEV's and transmit those to each other's consciousness,  very unique type of communication that I value a lot in psychedelics.


T+03:00 - Drinking green tea with chocolate, eating mandarins, smoking  pot and playing vintage Sega videogames! Rolling nicely but feeling that  the trip is on the decline already.  Conversation is a lot easier than  my previous trials with AL-LAD (Could be due to partial decomposition of  my material, or mixing with ETH-LAD, or both) so we talk about all the  things in the world, the night feels magical and I so dont want to think  about going to work the next day...


T+04:00 - Decided to have an indian food dinner with some beers,  enjoying it, although not sure if really hungry at this point. Very nice  glowing is still going on, with eyes closed I can still see some  interesting visuals but fading already.


T+05:00 - Took a shower together that became very intimate pretty soon...) 


T+06:00  - Sex was great, even though the concentration was  not perfect, it was long and expressive,  very animalistic, with some angry notes in it,  powerful orgasm resulted in a burst of purplish-red-yellow-green colors  and extreme bodily pleasure. Lysergamides are great for sex imo,  especially AL-LAD and regular LSD (ETH-LAD seems to produce more  introspection for me).


T+06:30 - There is still some stimulation going on, so we both take  tablet of Cardimap (Rauwolfia Serpentina - herbal anti-psychotic),  tablet of Validol, some extract of Kava and Valerian Root and try to  fall asleep. Was dreaming vividly in about half an hour or so. Woke up  pretty refreshed although I wish I would not have to work today...


I have noticed some weird ear popping effect this time, like there's too  much air in my head and its coming out of my ears, but of course, most  likely it has something to do with an inner ear, Ive had similar effects  with mushrooms and DMT at times. Also, every time I take AL-LAD, the  experience is different for me, but I guess, Its a good thing, and this  time both of us didn't feel the annoying excess of energy as the last  couple of times we tried it.


Thank you for reading friends! ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

AL-LAD is my favorite, but it's the lysergamides that give me the most vasoconstriction.

Can be frightening when I see the tip of my fingers at the very last part of the trip.

 - in that case I'd suggest preloading with some vasodilators, safe ones like Sulbutiamine, Magnesium and Garlic extract, some Agmatine maybe. They work for me but then again, vasoconstriction usually never bothers me.

Tried it for the first time, 80 ug.


Was seriously pleasant. Normally lysargimides cause a lot of manic thoughts. Felt serene. 


Minor changes in perspective. Really faint CEVs, wasn't sure if I was imagining it.


Was only a casual night in. My partner was just drinking alcohol and it was a good match. Drunk and psychedelic normally don't mix.


Vasconstriction sucked. I used l-arginine but I have a tightness to my chest that's really annoying. Probably need to think more about using a mix of vasodiliators.


Hour 8 now - I think I'll be able to sleep soon.

This is better than Eth-lad and 1p-lsd. At 180ug no mindfuck at all, nice visuals with a lot of morphing.


Come up with a bodyload that wasn't unpleasant at all but definitely present! Some may don't like it ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

In my experience, a lot of chest pains form psychs could come from extreme bloating, that would cause the diaphragm to push up and physically cause heart aches and generally unpleasant chest tightness. I have found that taking Simethicone (antibloating OTC med) helps pretty good with that issue.

Also try magnesium before and after the trip to reduce negative body effects.


I like my AL-LAD with a little of ETH-LAD mixed in. AL-LAD does not agree very well with LSD imo. I have also tried all three isomers together (1 hit of LSD+1 hit of AL-LAD+1 hit of ETH-LAD) that yielded a very weird trip with a lot of confusion throughout and unbalanced energies.

Vitamins like magnesium, vitamin c, vitamin b12 and omega 3 should be taken before, during and after tripping. That is the best way to reduce or even completely avoid negative body effects. And of course a lot of water during the experience.

Mixed a 150mcg blotter of AL-LAD with 18mg of AL (Allylescaline) last night that yielded a quite colorful and sparkly trip that lasted a lot longer (total of 11 hours compare to 5-6hrs of AL-LAD by itself) and felt at least 1.5 times stronger than AL-LAD by itself. The bodyload was about the same as without AL, but I felt a lot more inebriated and I felt a lot more connection to my body, the trip was more euphoric too.


During the trip I was enjoying both CEV's and OEV's, got pretty involved in the visual theater actually! Neon colors -greens, yellows, lots of purple and blues. CEV's were corresponding to music in a weird kind of winamp visualization simple plugin style - flat grey and black geometric surfaces that were morphing and rippling with colors as the music played! ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


There was an interesting moment of very nice classic fractal psychedelia when I was observing myself laughing at myself when observing myself laughing at myself when observing myself laughing at myself and to the infinity - it actually became a visual image in my head that started to come out and become a quite bright OEV! 8(


Not much of the introspection but the previously building up conflict between me and my girlfriend was resolved after the peak subsided as it became very clear that we are both trying to protect our egos and prove worthiness to each other by exhibiting "I don't care" behavior and playing "mind games". 

Love is all we need! %)

That's funny about your recursive laughter experience.

It's really interesting to read about your experiments involving these 'scalines (MAL, AL etc) Volsam, they a very under-explored group of chemicals. 

Poetic to combo the allyl 6-sub lysergemide with the allyl mescaline analog. Just need to add a tryptamine allyl sub (MALT or DALT) to complete the holy trinity of allyls ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

I find AL-LAD to be perhaps the most humorous psychedelic I've tried.  I find things funny to a really profound extent, finding humor in the meta realms.

- Its funny, I have had a similar thought but couldn't find any allyl trypts... :D


I definitely feel resemblance between all allyl-, methyl-, ethyl- and propyl- compounds (lysergamides-phenethylamines-tryptamines). Methyl- being the speedy ones with the strongest effect, allyl- being pretty strong and stimulating too but with muted psychedelia although nice glowing visuals, ethyl- being quite slow and transparent but pretty serious, introspective and with unexpected visuals, and propyl- being stimulating, a bit dissociative and very "bodily" and not very psychedelic. But that's just for me ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Smoking a bowl on the come up (180ug) was the wrong decision. The experience got blurry and it made it hard to relaxe. No bad trip at all, but uncomfortable af. It's waaay better not to smoke at all (except cigarettes) and leave it for the come down.

Totally agree with this.

For some reason I find that ald52 in particular causes bloating, to the extent that it can sometimes get mighty uncomfortable. I haven't experimented with Al-Lad as much, but experiences so far have given less bloating.


Pre-dosing with l-arginine before every trip is a ritual with me (I often dose it again after about 4 hours) as well as magnesium and I have found that I do not suffer any vasoconstriction  (even on relatively high doses of DOC at 4.5mg).


On the mixing front, I found mixing eth-lad with ald52 to be extremedy challenging (then eth-lad can be challenging on its own and it was a dose of 200ug eth-lad + 125ug ald), but am interested in mixing al-lad and ald52. Eth-lad + al-lad also sounds interesting.

Yes, ETH-LAD + AL-LAD does sound interesting! What dosages have you mixed Volsam? I was thinking 150-225µg of AL-LAD with about 50-75µg of ETH-LAD would be pretty cool. 


Last time I did ETH-LAD I had a strong intuition that using ETH-LAD as the minor component in lysergemide mixtures was a really good direction.

With some of not very successful combinations I'd feel that substances are  tugging my psyche apart and I can't find the balance, but combination of  AL-LAD and ETH-LAD always feels nice and natural for me! ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


I'd normally take 1 part of ETH-LAD to 3 parts of AL-LAD, so if taking a single 150mcg hit of AL-LAD, I'd add about 50mcg of ETH-LAD. The trip becomes more rounded and complete, ETH-LAD adds missing depth and insight imo.


I want to try predosing with L-arginine as well! ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

What's the L-arganine for?


That's the kind of ratio I was thinking about, good to hear it went well. Really want to try it.

L-arginine is a vasodilator.  Good for combatting vasoconstriction.

Please tell us more about it. I recently had about 180ug and smoking a bowl during the come up turned it into a unpleasant trip. Not a bad trip, just not as clear and happy as usual with Al-lad.

I try to remember it because it happened a few years ago. It's all there but I have to dig it up.


It was one of the most meaningful trips of my life because it was the first time I took psychedelics with my big brother. It was his first time taking any psychedelic which made it even more profound. I had taken AL-LAD once before that, those blotters were sold as 192µg per blotter if I recall correct. I think I tried one before taking ~450µg and I remember that it felt mild compared to LSD. I took it alone and had a pleasant evening with myself, this was when I was 21-22 years old I guess. I was fairly new to tripping then and the experience was so smooth and easy I was ready to take a high dose, but oh boy I had no idea what I was going to experience when I more than doubled the dose.


It was dark autumn night and I tried to tell my brother what it was going to be like. I don't know if I prepared him for it well or not but after all everything worked out. I remember I was starting to have a bad trip at some point when I was peaking when I lost the perception of where I am, I was in my room but I couldn't see where I was. I remember my brother giving me my keys for some reason and it took a lot of time to understand what he was giving me because I really couldn't see or understand what it was. At some point I went to the toilet to pee and that was when it really got scary. The visuals were so overwhelming I couldn't pee, I remember seeing spiders coming from everywhere. Now I know it was my pubic hairs that were the visuals and they came at me so strongly I panicked and thought they were spiders. :D I had arachnophobia as a child and that's the reason I saw them I guess. Like most psychedelic trips going south, it's all about facing your fears.


Well I had to go out of the house to my yard to pee, my brother calmed me and helped me because I was really starting to lose it. After I got to pee all was ok again for a while. I remember at some point we were sitting on the couch in the living room with my brother and he was cutting my toenails because I hadn't cut them for so long time :D


I also remember that we went out again, maybe for a smoke, and I was tripping so hard I couldn't see the yard of my neighbour. We went back inside and listened to music, all was cool and we thought the trip was basically over - that's what usually happens when you get used to the effects I have realized.


That is when we started to smoke weed, and we smoked it so much, it was some strong sativa strain and I think I have never smoked so much weed in a night. How stupid we were. :D 


Maybe 15 minutes later it started, everything melted, my brother went to the other room and I was alone in my room laying on my bed. I closed my eyes and it was the moment of breakthrough, there was no difference if my eyes were open or closed, all I saw was the universe. I was flying in space at the speed of light, I could paint anything I ever wanted in my mind and it would come to me. I remember fantasizing about fucking and it felt better than real sex, it was orgasmic, there are no words really. It was pure ego death, there was no concept of me or I, I was gone, I don't know for how long, there was no concept of time. It was truly one of the most remarkable experiences of my life.

Okay so im interested in giving this one more shot. I haclve one question though. I hear that al lad is very visual, but is it more visual than lsd?

Are the visuals more intricate or complex. Cuz they would have to be for me to dish out as much dough i would need to trip. It seems that 300ugs is kinda the point where it gets intersting.

How was your first time? I thought the visuals had a Aztec style. I also found it hard to walk on 225ug (I had a tolerance though, took some the weekend before). It was heavy but in a beautiful way. A lot of people say Al-lad is more visual than Lsd. I can't really compare the two, because my last time taking Lsd was maaaany years ago. From what I've experienced and read 300ug will blown your mind and the visuals will be out if this world. Maybe even to a point where the visuals will almost cover your entire sight. Almost every trip report on this substance with 300ug is out of this world.

Ok, I thought you took Al-lad before, because you said another shot ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) If you really want an intense trip you should probably take 300ug. If you don't have a tolerance, it will definitely hit you HARD! The visuals will definitely be very strong. I recommend staying inside for this one, but it's up to you. My next trip will be 250ug and then if it goes well I'll try 300ug. I started step by step from 170ug to 185ug to 200ug. Meaning I definitely had a tolerance (tripped every weekend). I read reports where people took 300ug and for some the visuals were overwhelming and some even started hearing unpleasant sounds. Maybe you should start with 200ug or 250ug, if you don't have a tolerance. Good luck! Waiting for your report ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Yes jesus it was incredible and just you are right i cant replicate it.

And ps. Mr gratfull i have tried al lad when it first came out at 150 ugs and i thought that lsz was stronger. Imho

I also stored them improperly in a fridge and al lad is fickle as a.f and degradges quick so mabey thats why i diddnt feel it.

I really just want strong visuals. Thats all im really after at this point. I almost got there with 1 hit of lsd (unkowm dose) and 1 hit of ald 52 (125ug) but after the peak they died out. quickly. I am on kpins but i dont take any the day of the trip so im guessing the half life of the drug is dulling the effects. 

Its starting to get frustrating. 

Anyways im guess i should pick up some before its gone lol.

concentrate on the tip of your nose

as you breathe in, mentally say "beginning" (at the beginning), "middle" (at the middle), "end" (at the end), 

and as you breathe out,  mentally say "beginning" (at the beginning), "middle" (at the middle), "end" (at the end).

if you notice a long breath, mentally say "a long breath".

if your mind wanders, bring it back


you should be asleep in short order.

I have a similar problem with lysergamides. If I take them after noon, sleep is always very hard to obtain. I will be rolling around in bed, restless, and there's always a chorus of these weird clickety-whooshing wah-wahy sounds in my ears - very distracting.


Really the best way how to avoid this issue, for me, is to dose early in the day. Or trip on mushrooms instead ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) I like them a lot more than lysergamides, anyway.

I just eat downers and then boom within an hour or two I'm out; some people think that's 'cheating' though.

If taking downers for coming down/beeing able to sleep is cheating, so it is snorting cocaine for beeing awake, or eating psychedelics for personal improvement. So why the fuck take drugs?

Downers feels like cheating to me, so allow me to explain my train of thought ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) 


It's because I'd be cheating myself out of what I find often often to be the most productive/useful part of the trip. A great time to reflect and integrate when I'm coming down. I'd rather be a bit tired the next day than miss out on that. But I often do have a boozy drink at the end of a trip to wind things down anyways.


I find sleep deprivation from psychedelics to be a lot easier to manage than sleep deprivation from other causes. Not sure if it's just the afterglow, or if the psychedelic state allows some amount of the regenerative effects of sleep to happen while you're actually awake or what. Maybe PD sleep deprivation is easier to put up with just because the previous PD experience can be so refreshing. 


When I took a full dose of AL-LAD, I really craved a good strong hoppy beer near the end of the trip. It became the only thing I could think about ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) And it was delicious!

I also don't mind being unable to sleep from psychedelics as I find myself comfortable and thoughtful.  Sleep deprivation the next day is pretty nice too, it sort of maintains the trips slightly, especially with long-lasters like DOC or AMT.  I have sometimes taken etizolam at the end when I really just needed to sleep, but generally I try to ride it out.


I don't consider it cheating though, it's just the way I prefer.  I will say, if you never let a psychedelic wear down all the way on its own, you're definitely missing part of the trip.

Oh, I also enjoy the psychedelic comedown and after effects, and just force myself to sleep in the few cases I need shit to do next morning. I usually dose myself on the weekends in order to avoid that behaviour and beeing able to enjoy the psychedelics the whole experience.


I usually end the trip with some beer, cannabis, GBL, benzo, or a mix of them all, but just because I'm a GABA-stuff lover, not in order to cut any bad trip or after effects ^^


The thing is, I can't consider using drugs as a tool or for recreation cheating at all. Believing that would be accepting 90% of my life was a cheat x)

Next time I'll definitely start earlier since I agree with that the come down is nice to experience as well. Even lying awake in bed not being able to sleep is ok. But I guess I'll try with some benzos or GHB next time if I can't fall asleep - just to see if keeping my rhythm affects the afterglow in a different way..

Had another adventure with Alladin last friday. I think I'm in love with this substance. 225ug seems to be perfect for a night with friends. Lots of laughing and deep conversations. Smoking weed at the 3h mark was also nice.

So what do y'all think, would 150ug AL-LAD + 100ug LSD be pretty much equal in strength to 200ug LSD or 300ug AL-LAD? Or do they have a 1+1=3 synergy?

I haven't mixed the two personally, but I would be surprised if they had a 1 + 1 = 3 type of synergy. I reckon you're strength estimate is about right.

I'd say that dose sounds about right. Tried it twice: 

150 AL-LAD + 2/3 of a strong LSD hit, was pretty much perfect

225 AL-LAD + 3/4 of a medium LSD hit - too much AL-LAD, got super confusing and overwhelming

Hi guys, a very good friend of mine is having his 30th birthday party this weekend and I was thinking of dropping AL-LAD there. The thing is that I don't want to be "weirded out" because I want to hang out with everyone and enjoy the party, but I'm afraid the acid will make me uncomfortable... do you think this is doable on lad or I should roll instead?

AL-LAD, to me, is a great choice for a social psychedelic.  However some people seem to have a much stronger trip on it I've noticed, so if you haven't tried it before, try it first in a situation where you feel more comfortable.  I find that AL-LAD makes me feel silly and it can make me lose my train of thought pretty easily, and I laugh a lot.  It's amazing to take with friends where you all take it.  It definitely does intoxicate me and alters my behavior, but I feel very comfortable and euphoric, not weirded out at all.  That comes down to me having tripped a whole lot of times over the course of about 16 years, and me being in situations where I didn't care how I was perceived.  Honestly for a party, if you don't know everyone there well, I'd go for a roll instead.  If I did know everyone there well, and there weren't a lot of people, I'd probably choose AL-LAD instead.

Can anyone compare very recent batches with the older batches? I have never only done Al lad once and I think it was just 1 tab, didn't feel much. I have heard people complain about the new brown paper is weak at 4 hits. I understand that the dose for Al lad is much higher than LSD or ald-52, but am I seriously gonna have to drop 5 hits to get some decent effects? Or are these posters either tolerant to lysergamines or they are taking benzos which dull the effects. I wonder this because Al-LAD  pretty expensive per dose and it's obviously a novelty because of that, if I have to spend almost 30 to 50 bucks for 1 trip it's probably not worth trying in my opinion. Again not asking for price comparisons or any sourcery but I would like to get somones opinion on the most current batch's quality and if it's exactly the same as previous years.

The thing is that I don't want to be "weirded out" because I want to hang out with everyone and enjoy the party, but I'm afraid the acid will make me uncomfortable... do you think this is doable on lad or I should roll instead?

Cool, thanks Xorkoth and Mr Grateful. I will drop the LAD then, and cross out alcohol. I don't like weed so that isn't an issue. If things get freaky I think I can go to a private room or the toilet and ride it out for a couple of minutes.

I'll let you guys know how it went ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Don't worry, it won't get freaky or weird unless you take like two or three tabs. That's why I love Al-lad. Enjoy the party ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Oh! I kinda chickened out/didn't feel like it, so I had a couple beers, some drinks and had an amazing time anyway. My girl is taking a very important exam this tuesday and she already told me that if she passes we're going to get high off anything I want on saturday, so we're probably dropping lad next weekend :D

Ok ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) Al-lad will definitely not disappoint you. Once I tried it with two beers and some weed every now and then and it was still amazing.

@ShroomySatori 


I would take Al-lad and if its too mild you can take another tab of Al-lad. This will definitely give you a good vibe and you'll be in control of things. And I wouldn't mess with heroin at all but that's just my personal opinion ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


Yeah and I think it would be better if they each take one tab of Acid. If its too mild they can still take a half of tab. I think two tabs for the first time have the potential to become overwhelming. Peace


P.s. The best thing you can do is stay sober like a trip sitter.

If you're a experienced user one tab of Al-lad will have you act like a sober person if things get critical. Two tabs of Al-lad are still manageable imo, but three tabs is another level (450ug). I couldn't do shit but go to the bathroom when I was on three tabs of Al-lad ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Thanks for the advice Mr Grateful! I am a heroin addict for 5 years so I am certainly not going to be in withdrawal while this experience is going on ![:!](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/argh.gif) but I plan on sniffing my regular daily dose, not being high just well. And keeping it a secret from my little bro of course.  


I'm experienced enough to take the AL-LAD for sure, and I think it would be fine that way. However, I am still dealing with a breakup and we were together for 5 years and it just completely broke my heart. She ran away. I'm dealing with a lot and I might stay on my version of sober. If I end up taking the Aladdin it definitely wouldn't hurt though. I think I might just get really sad about my past girlfriend though, I wouldn't want to be thinking about her and I know she would pop up at some point. However, combined with my heroin I don't think it would phase me. I'd just have a great time and be a little more sober... I really want them to freak and have a serious hardcore life changing trip. I just know from past experiences that I should probably wait until I'm over it and I'm just not. I'll see how I'm feeling about it that day. If I'm in a happy mood and not sad over her, why not. Knowing me, I'll take AL-LAD : ) it's a nice middle ground between a full blown acid trip, and being sober. I've taken 1 tab a bunch of times and have two sheets of the stuff, one of my favourite psychedelics.

I admire your honesty. 


Ok, if so they won't figure it out. You seem like a good guy. I believe you can beat heroin and live a life without it. You probably know exactly who to contact. Go for it ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


Yeah that's probably the best way. If you're feeling really really good the Al-lad won't do no harm. Once I tried having bad thoughts while on Al-lad but it just didn't work. It's really the friendly version of LSD.


Be careful and report back. Peace

Just feel like I have to say it, but if you're trying to beat heroin, shooting it for the second time is totally the opposite of the way to do that... don't let a painful breakup get you deep(er) into opiates.  Not sure where you're at with opiates but god damn if everything isn't 100 times worse pretty soon after it's temporarily numbed for a bit.  The deeper you go, the worse everything becomes and the harder it is to do anything about it.  Take care. ![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif)


If you're to the point that you really don't believe you can do it and you've tried everything else, you might consider ibogaine.

I'm sorry for being off-topic, but I'd also suggest trying 4-Aco-DET, if available, for addiction issues. IME it has the strongest potential to view and correct my sins, troubling thoughts, self-escapes and self-judgements of anything I've tried so far (I have not tried ibogaine and neither was I addicted to opioids).


AL-LAD can be pretty introspective too if you put your mind to it and take at least 300mics. Keep in mind increased vasoconstriction with increased dosage - Agmatine and Magnesium could be of benefit with that as few members mentioned across the forum.

Also  L-arginine is good for vasoconstriction if taken before a vasoconstrictor.

So I will get high on heroin, possibly shoot it for the 2nd time and then get really high on aladdin while watching over my little bro and his friends tripping mad balls on acid. Just to make sure things are chill, and I'll have a little valium on hand in case they are not. Since, I will probably give them two strong hits. Strong as in, a quarter blotter will produce a mild trip and half of one freaked me out one time. I'll report back for sure!

Like Xorkoth said, you shouldn't shoot it. Especially not if it's for the second time. Just don't do it. If you really have to do it stick with sniffing it.

I've been reading research papers on lysergamides, and one of them had an analysis of 4 AL-LAD blotters. It must have been an early batch because the paper is about AL-LAD and LSZ. The blotters, advertised as 150ug each, contained about 156.32, 157.64, 183.95, and 216.39 micrograms of AL-LAD hemitartrate. For some reason, a lot of people assume that the RC lysergamides are dosed accurately, but those are some very unevenly laid tabs.

That makes sense since alot of people were getting huge hits or misses back then. And I got weak tabs :-(

At least they are not UNDERDOSED! ![:-)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Micrograms to 2 decimal points? You got a source - be interested to read it - certainly had a couple of goes way back that really went way over that expected.

The AL-LAD was measured as a salt, but the LSZ was measured as freebase. If you calculate the equivalent amount of LSZ as the hemitartrate salt, it averages at about 150ug.

Aladdin is so chill. It's a damn shame he is going to be gone soon. My favorite lysergamide right now. My girl and I took 150 mics and watched the first NBA final game with my pops while he sipped on Milwaukee beast. Good times my friends.

I just don't get this drug. If I want a soft experience I surely don't think about lysergamides or tryptamines, I go for a 2C-x or some other phen.


Everytime I take this one, whatever the dosage, it feels so underwhelming for what I look after a lysergamide. A waste of money for sure, when 100ug of good old LSD are for me a far better experience than 300ug AL-LAD.


I supose that's because I'm always searching at least some mindfuck or introspection when taking a psychedelic, and I have got hard times getting visuals from any psychedelic at all, so AL-LAD just feels like beeing sober.

To each their own I suppose. I get real nice cartoony visuals, tons of euphoria and nonstop laughter. The lack of mindfuckiness is actually what I love about alladin. Acid without the headspace. Just pure FUN. Definitely not sober though...

Aladdin is a great name for a drug. I'm gonna watch [Aladdin](http://www.princessmovies.tv/disney-princess/aladdin.html) next time I have/am with/am on Aladdin. I've got two gel tabs of LSD now though.

True. For an introspective experience you have to take at least 300ug of Al-lad (not recommended for beginners). On 450ug I immediately jumped into different dreamy realities when I closed my eyes. I also had very very strong OEV's and it was real hard to walk and talk. Did smoke some weed with it which definitely gave it a boost.


But the euphoria is crazy with Al-lad. It's like the Mdma under the lysergamides ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) 


Any experiences with AL-LAD + LSD? Think is a nice combo.

Don't switch over to oxys. Lol they are as bad as hearoin if not worse. Get on bupes or methadone and get off the shit.  Trust me you won't regret anything. I sure as hell don't regret quitting. Lol

hen I am crying myself to sleep every night at this point over my heroin habit. It has hurt me so much. I have a fun weekend with friends planned and I plan on taking 2 or 3 doses of al-lad and blowing my mind. 


I smoked weed for the first time since last September the other day and it was really psychedelic cognitively speaking, not sensory. My habit was staring at me everywhere I looked. It's been 5 years and it is time to stop, or die. The trip isn't going to hurt. I've been tripping for a decade or longer and I expect to have a lot of suffering and negativity come up. So I'm choosing a light-hearted substance to make up for that, it should still be really deep.


I'm really excited and I'll be surrounded by friends. The focus will be the habit (I won't be using around them, I am too embarassed and we have always tripped out on acid and Mdma together, my friends are silly), I have learned how to shoot up recently. i shot up 4 doses in a row over a couple days, each into a different vein and I disposed of all my IV equipment today. It made me feel violated and I will never do it again but I want to see if a trip can help me come to any further insights. I cry myself to sleep every night over my habits and problems so maybe it can help, and I've done it before. Lone my aladdin, love my weed, love my dope... but the dope has hurt me too much. 


If not, I have ibogaine to resort to. Whoever said oxy is worse than heroin. LOL. Oxy's did not hurt me a tenth as much. Not a thousandth. They did nothing... I did not suffer like this until I used heroin extensively. I'm using them today, and I'm not the slightest bit high, oxy is useless to me even if I take 400mg a day. It's nothing compared to the quality heroin I get. Heroin is something you progress to from oxy. And don't tell me what to do when I know I have a problem.

Man up and get some help op... In the end you are the only one that can help yourself here.

 So yeah we could go on and on about this for a couple pages but remember that this is the Al-LAD thread and this is nothing related to Al lad.

I think you may find better luck in heroin/oxy threads or other drug treatment threads. 

We love you and want to see you well so with that being said stop crying yourself to sleep get a grip on your habit like I had to through whatever means, wether that 'cure' is iboaga, Suboxone or methadone.(or better none) 

 Anything is better than a Oxycontin/heroin habit.

 I don't care how pure you think your shit is man it takes 1 bad batch to die. Unless you are getting those Oxys directly prescribed to you from a doctor there is no way of you knowing that those pills are not counterfeit and there are a lot of counterfeit Oxys out right now full of fenanyl. 

 That is a race to the grave no one wants to see. 

Much love and light and be well in the coming days. 

Let's get back to AL LAD ?

I'm taking 600 micrograms of AL-LAD tonight thought and was going to report on my experience. I was just describing a little of the set and setting. I'll be with some great friend on a fun adventure.

I'm taking an amount that I think will permanently change me. 

I plan on quitting without subs or methadone or iboga but that is irrelevant I was just mentioning that I am have an opiate habit and I also have experience with AL-LAD and I'm seeing if it might help me find my way. I had a really great afterglow when I've taken it before, but never that high a dose. 


I'm really excited for tonight!!! It's going to be a wonderful time, seeing my friends after so long. It's a good time to trip and work through some issues and have a fun time with my old pals. Really psyched! I have decided to take 600 micrograms. 


I wouldn't be posting in this thread if it wasn't related to AL-LAD man. I love the stuff, and by the way, I don't deserve to be bashed like this for mentioning I have a drug problem. Let's get back to AL-LAD right, and ignore the drug addict who is taking it for potentially therapeutic purposes. He isn't a human until he gets help, and his word is meaningless until he stops taking opiates. It's not as simple as replacing it with a maintenance drug. Being experienced with all sorts of psychedelics, before and after injuring mg spine. High dose AL-LAD is is calling out to me today, I'm not going to question it, but take the 4 blotters tonight.  feel really comfortable around my friends and they don't judge me for that or tell me to quit as I have a disability which is beside the point. But, I really think the could be awesome. Iboga is dangerous, people die from caridovascular-related complications. I know what I am, I don't need a 10 line lecture when I've already started to contfront this a long time ago. 


This *is * AL-LAD. Not everyone takes psychedelics in a happy mindset to report on headspace and visuals. If I said I was depressed or trying to get over a relationship or something like that I wouldn't be treated this way. I don't need my problem to be brought up and be told to look elsewhere. AL-LAD is calling out to me and I don' question why. Every time I take a psychedelic, it's unplanned until the day that I take it. I'd like to report on whether or not this helped with my dependency, depression, chronic pain and several other issues. I don't need to be told to "man up" for fucks sake. I am a man, I am a 29 year old solid dude and taking opiates does not make me any less of a man. I'm not a pussy. I had a severe injury and it seems that you are very judgmental, or maybe since you took the same drug you are treating me like shit for taking it as well (at least, that's how I'm perceiving it. I'm taking it as a fucking insult).

No need to get offended bro. I wasn't bashing you, I don't know you tour situation and don't claim to. All I suggest is you get help. I have lost 5 high School friends this year alone to heroin/Oxys.

Finally I had an awesome trip with this at 450ug mixed with ketamine, 3-meo-pcp and 2-oxo-pcm. Still not my cup of tea, and would prefer 250ug of LSD over this. An overall lackluster experience, but with awesome OEV (Still worse visuals than with LSD or ETH-LAD)

Yes, the later produced brown paper blotters of AL-LAD definitely have more inconsistency and generally I found them to be underdosed compared to the first white/yellowish paper ones - I have three different sheets from different times and maybe it's just biased thinking but I like the earlier batches more.

I think I messed up my blotters. Had to use the baggy for something else and packaged it loosely in some chocolate paper. Took half a blotter yesterday to test it and could barely feel it (take psychedelics maybe every 2 months).

I find a half blotter of AL-LAD to be barely threshold honestly, for me 1 blotter is very light, 2 is moderate, and 3 is where I want to be.  Seems a good bit less potent than the others.  I'd try taking a full dose next time and see what happens.  It's definitely possible it degraded, which would suck extra bad considering AL-LAD is about to become a unicorn...


How long was it packaged badly?  If just for a day or a couple of days it seems unlikely it would cause a significant amount of degradation, unless it got damp or was exposed to light a lot.

I just stuffed 24 blotters A-Lad supposedly 150 mics each into an brown bottle with 50 eyedropper measures of  distilled water (each measure looks 1/3 filled - easy to repeat later)

I have been shaking the bottle intermittently and will remove the paper tomorrow, and chew before tossing. after that I will try 2 droppers worth on the weekend, expecting ~130 mics maybe.

^^ Just curious, why did you do it that way instead of leaving it on blotters?  It's more stable dry than wet.  Was it to standardize in case the blotters were unevenly laid?

Careful when you chew those 24 blotters - even if the AL-LAD dissolves perfectly (which it should) there should be a lot of the liquid remaining in the blotters. I feel like I don't need to tell you this, but just in case..

You should weight the blotters before you soak them, and then after you have wrung them out. Then with some maths you can figure out how much AL-LAD is in them based on knowing how much solution is in them, and how concentrated your solution is.

Why not just purchase the powder and make a more acccurate solution? That way you know for sure how much you're dosing.

I'm still in physical withdrawals 2 weeks later, so I haven't dosed this yet. I decided to get clean first before taking a long acting psychedelic because I didn't really want to do heroin when I was high, or be sick. 


I'm going to smoke DMT today though and see if it will help. I'm a little concerned because of how weak my body is, but my willpower is very strong and I've been having insane cravings for heroin heroin heroin fucking heroin so I need to do something. I woke up today and decided to smoke DMT, randomly, but I don't question my desire to use a psychedelic. I haven't used any psychedelics in a year and a half, apart from Mdma and I did have a psychedelic experience with it when I did it that time so it does count in this case. 


And Bigazznugz I was in a really dark place, I didn't mean to offend you man. I could die too, and I have a LOT to lose. I too like big ass nuggs haha. Soooo much more than little popcorn buds. I don't think human incarnations are very common and it's killing me to be sitting around braindead like this...

Status on my nut {remember I took my low or irregularly doped  dark AL LAD blotters and put 24 (from a set of 25) into a 100 ml brown dropper bottle with 50 droppers of distilled water (50 ml).}

After shaking them up for the better part of 2 days,  I  took out the paper from the water, squeezed it into the bottle and popped all 24 sqished blotters into my mouth hoping to catch what did not go into solution, and thinking it may not be that much. (maybe I got half or 1ml of water in the whole wad)

20 mins later I do have some alerts that were stronger than the full tab I had on the weekend. 

If it stays this way, it is probably placebo, and I will go for 3 droppers full (3ml)  - equal 1.5 blotters. 

I still don't believe they were 150 mics each as advertised. but who knows maybe just irregularly applied to the paper, or altogether bunk (still possible from where I sit)


edit: 1.5 hours later, I have the effects of 1/3 tab lsd slanted into the direction of AL-LAD - not manic, but visually enhanced, and emotionally buoyant, mentally silly. that is just from chewing on the paper debris - that which  did not dissolve and what adhered when removed from solution. I think I will not try the liquid tonight. but will on sunday or saturday.


edit: 1 hour later, having walked outside I rejig what this feels like

it is more like very strong lsd - a full tab or more

I cannot read instructions about my camera or anything.

I did figure out how to put on air conditioning.

enjoy!


edit 1/2 hour later - how to explain being so accidentally stoned with no idea how much I took but it's AL-LAD and it's less than 3 milligrams and it's lovely- that's for sure, but this is definitely jamming. I took everything out of my pockets, did amazing things with SD cards and computers, turned of the AC and opened al the windows 

again.


I sure hope there's something left in that bottle, but I may need to wait more than a week to check.


edit: 1 hour later - still raging - great visual patina over everything - more like living in a prism the sunset is glorious golden and pink light is pervading everything. all the usual village sounds amazing birds, even scraping of sticks or whatever, lovely stuff.


edit 90 minutes later - leveling off  but still enhanced - It was a good session. 

Eating was not easy to do, so I didn't.

a pipe might taste nice.

OK 3 days later could not wait - so I took 2ml of the water described in previous "experiment"  (to alleviate variable dosage experience with the so called 150 mic blotters - the first one of which seemed very under dosed) and an hour and 20 mins later  this is coming on as very sparkly indeed! subjectively like 75 mics but could be more, at least I know how much push and sparkle to expect from two droppers now, and I am confirming that 3 days is adequate (for me) to have very little tolerance having used more than 75 mics during the cleanup of the experiment.


(edit: the tolerance break was not long enough to get the full value, but at least I know that there is a good amount available per ml (dropper) when next I come to this substance, rather than the hit or miss disappointment from the unevenly laid blotters - which, if evenly laid, would be preferred for storage)

150ug of AL-LAD bioassayed over the weekend, after being stored with dessicant in sealed containers in the deepfreeze for more than 2 years. Absolutely no noticeable loss in potency. For anyone considering stocking up on a lifetime supply of this before it vanishes, I believe it's going to have a long shelf life under these kinds of conditions.


edit: it was stored for 3 years, just realized

AL-LAD will kick your behind if you take enough. I have had some of the single, greatest COVs in doses of about 500-700 micrograms. I have also encountered some of the trippiest headspace as well. I find that, again, it is really one of the greatest psychedelics ever at high doses. It takes some time and effort to find your sweet spot, but when you do, it is something else. Probably my favorite one besides LSD, but because it is shorter acting, you can squeeze in experiences more efficiently.

There's a new report on Erowid from someone who claims he accidentally ingested 3000 µg of AL-LAD, but something doesn't quite add up. How did he not trip for days on a dose like this?

Not exactly the full bandwidth of lsd, but rich on euphoria, and fluid impressions:

I was not as verbal on al-lad that I might be on lsd,  but just as visual and intuitive.


here is an odd way to think of it, if you have a place to park it:


al-lad is like a fresh new economy car, shiny, adequate acceleration and brakes, tight suspension, air conditioning and sound system. - what more could you want? it is enough, lovely.


lsd is like a top of the line Cadillac, luxury, power in reserve, speed, safety and satisfaction at every turn for every passenger. It is more than enough, lovely.

Is it worse in others?  will 200ug provide OEV, COV, full conscious shift? how long does it last?  and again is there a body load?

Yes, it has OEV's starting at 200-300 ug. CEV's starting at 175-200ug. Less bodyload than Lsd. More euphoric than Lsd (the euphoria is crazy, I fucking love it). Laughing throughout the trip is a part of Al-lad. 


Duration 5-8 hours depending on how much you take. Smoking weed definitely enhances the experience a lot. 


I took 450ug and almost experienced ego death while just sitting on the couch, but I didn't let go cuz I was with friends. It was really really intense but beautiful. I couldn't even walk straight. 


If you're experienced with Lsd, you can easily start with 200-300ug but don't underestimate Al-lad. 300ug will have you flying and feeling fantastic with OEV's & CEV's. And yeah there's no mindfuck/headspace until 450ug. Everything is clear and not dreamy like on Lsd. A experienced user will find one tab (150ug) underwhelming but starting at 200ug everyone will have a really really good time. Peace

Much less body load than LSD. I get a body load on like 50ug LSD (probably not these days, I feel like I am getting more and more comfortable with psychedelics as I continue to trip out, and also taking higher doses... my brain is totally fried still. I'd probably take a ten strip of lsd next time too) but on 1400ug AL-LAD I did not have one (1500 micrograms sorry haha, 10 hits). I'd give yourself 3 days to recover with this type of dose. You have to take a high dose, higher than acid. Very colourful psych. Also, whenever I closed my eyes, whatever I thought about in my mind would appear in front of me so it can have CEV too. At the peak I couldn't see around me too there was so much colour and fractals. 

Profound too. I felt like my good friend had the exact opposite life as me so far. Tried explaining but it is too hard. I had some profound thoughts about little/big brothers and how it affects ya. I just tripped the fuck out, to understand you would need to have experienced my life from birth. haha. There was to so thing as well. Life only a dream, and we're the amazing of ourselves. Here's Tom with the weather. lol. That is seriously what it was like.

I was never afraid or anxious to and I have a panic disorder. It was amazing but holy fuck am I exhausted from it. For something with such light body load to psychedelic effect, it really wiped me out. Didn't leave my bed yesterday while recovering and also I slept for the longest sleep ever. Acid I can't sleep for like 20 hours after the trip. I'm still seeing these colours on the screen. Light pink, yellow, and green. It was like me and my friends laughing out asses off after life was said and done about how my life was played out reverse time. Also, duality. Duality was a huge part of the experience. 


This just totally changed my life. It brought me to tears. I truly see it as the culminating experience of my existence. I can see through logic how this is going to change my life. 

My memory is fried though. The message I got was that there isn't much time in life. I love my life and myself and I do no want to waste any time on this planet. I'm going to keep up with my hobbies every day, start taking job applications seriously, get the fuck out of this place more often and possibly chill at the beach with a friend today. I am going to address my benzo and opiate habits and be patient. The trip has completely changes my perspective on life. It was much more valuable than my dmt trips I've recently had, since I'm trying to quit opiates (correction: I have decided to quit opiates) and I'm two weeks out and have been having cravings, it's totally ruining my life though so I've been tripping a lot. I feel like the trip has changed some aspects of myself that were negative. I feel like this one has to be taken in high doses, in fact I feel like every psychedelic should be taken in high doses.


Make sure you have three days off if you are going going to take a dose like that. I have the best afterglow from a drug I have had, but no energy. When I took 150ug before, I had a wonderful energetic afterglow but totally although overjoyed, two days later I am still totally wiped and seeing pastel colour on the screen.


What's totally tripping me out about my trip in hindsight is that the speed of light, compared to the present moment. I feel like I'm lagging behind the present moment and that is somehow very significant to me (I have studied physics extensively, and always understood that but never saw it as so profound). Since my mom doesn't get the concept lol. Also the average difference between being born as a little brother and big brother was really tripping me out.

@ShroomySatori


You shouldn't recommend people to take very high doses of any psychedelic if you ask me. Maybe that's you, but maybe some one else will trip the fuck out and jump out the window becaus he's seeing a rainbow slide. 


I took Al-lad about 12-15 times (I didn't count) and 450ug had me shaking, it was really intense. You're talking about 1400ug..I don't know dude. Sounds like too much for a regular tripper if you ask me. No offense, just my personal opinion. Peace

I disagree on the bodyload part - AL-LAD is much weirder on my body than LSD. Makes my brain feel like jelly, and leaves me pretty fried the next day.

Al-LAD make my body temperature feel weird. Not sure if I really get hyperthermia or if it's just my temperature perception that gets messed up. But I feel a little bit uncomfortable with my temperature on it during the come-up. That's about the only side effect I get though.

Seem like people react different when it comes to the bodyload. I had 100ug of Lsd about two weeks ago and the bodyload was pretty present even during the trip. With Al-lad I have a little bodyload during the come up and after that I feel nothing but euphoria and a very mdma like feeling.

Mr Grateful, did I recommend a high dose? Sorry if I did. I don't think I did but I'm not gonna read through my post again. It was the first time I have taken a high dose of an LSD type drug, and it was one of the greatest trips of my life. I was having more body load when I took 150 micrograms than 1500. It's just the way it goes with trips with me. It really depends on my state of mind. Apparently not so much body... since I have been in opiate withdrawal and still am. 


I wasn't recommending a high dose, at least not intentionally. I have been at my wits end trying to quit heroin and that's why I did this, and also why I smoked DMT a couple times last week. I haven't used psychedelics in around a year and a half, I have zero tolerance to them. 


I don't know why I would take offence to that, I am an opiate addict using psychedelics to try and help me get clean of them and that definitely impacts the recommendation part. My best trips happen when I need the most help and centering in life, personally. Also, body load and freak outs are so random on psychedelics. Depends on so many factors. You might have a clean acid trip one time, and then one that feels really dirty a month later. I've heard of this happening frequently so don't count on this not having one because I didn't one time (I have during other times with much lower dose).


Anyways, it was one of the best trips of my life and if it helps me get clean I'm really not complaining. And, it totally did help a lot. I haven't had cravings since the trip, I've been too overwhelmed by the experience to have them.

I'm really glad your last experience helped you with your addiction, but imo it's better to say that every psychedelic and it's dosage should be taken step by step. Anyway let's not make a big deal out of it. What I am really curious about is how this trip will effect your addiction in long term. Hopefully it will end your addiction.

The trip reset my habits, opinions on things, it feels like I am learning how to do everything for the first time but it's like remembering a dream... it was a wild trip and I hope that it will not only end my H habit, but will also be a catalyst for change in most every other aspect of my life. I feel like a new man and I don't think I can ever be the same after that but we'll see, I already haven't done any H in several weeks. Since the trip, I have been taking 30mg oxy because I otherwise can't walk as my back is so messed up. I am totally cool with that as it is the only thing that has ever worked and made me function after my injury. So, I can't actually go 'clean' (I fucking hate that judgemental bullshit word) but 30mg oxy isn't shit. I was up to 300mg of really good quality H. Last time I picked up my oxy's, I went through them in 3 days. This time, that seems completely foolish to me. I really honestly can't see myself taking more than prescribed - and if I do, I will make up for it by taking less on a lazier day. Sure there is this opioid crisis but I also have a crisis. I have a facet joint problem in my thoracic spine that renders me completely debilitated physically. I used to be an athlete and had a very serious injury 7 years ago. I've been in extreme pain ever since unless on an opiate, and I spent 2 years before using them because I was a weed/psychs person but when I started getting panic attacks from the pain and stress I knew what to do. 


Anyways, I'm not too worried about that. I don't think I'm worried about anything anymore - I couldn't get out of bed the other day and I'm eating a lot of food, keeping healthy, doing yoga every day, playing guitar daily too, actually applying for jobs (it's always fucking tomorrow), not worried about women either after a 5 year breakup and feeling overwhelmed, better family relations too. Hopefully this super positive energy keeps going. I am curious about the same thing - how it will affect me long term. I don't know if I will ever take psychedelics again, I don't really see the point once I have finally gotten the message that I wanted. I don't need to know shit else to have a great life. I'm not interested in breaking a mild oxy physical dependency right now, because my spine is royally fucked and I just quit heroin, I don't find oxy's mentally addictive (only smokable and sniffable things and I don't have that) and do they ever improve my quality of life. There's a difference between physical dependency and addiction and I am really hoping that I will break the opiate addiction as if I don't I'll end up on H again. I just don't see it happening. I can't see that happening anymore at all, I don't even have an H connect anymore. I don't give a damn about taking 30mg oxy for the rest of my life or if people like to bash that since people in extreme, 24/7 pain shouldn't get relief. If I can't control it then I'll have to quit down the road, but of course I can control it. I am the imagination of myself as Hicks would say. 


Really therapeutic drug, just how I'm feeling today is remarkable. More motivated than I've likely been all year.

Yeah seriously, that's awesome, an accomplishment. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  It sounds like you're in a great place, just make sure to do the work now to maintain this.

Thanks! And yeah... I can't even really remember when I last got high on H... at least 3 weeks ago. I don't really care, I will never touch it again so long as I live. I spent the first two weeks in bed shaking, shivering, tossing and turning while my muscles were on fire and my nerves were totally shot. It had been essentially five years of constant abuse, as I have chronic pain well that's how it started. 


Thanks for the advice too man, I know I could be right back there in a moment but I cut myself off of all quality H connects and they were tough to find around here. I didn't really realize it was an accomplishment until just now. I laid in bed for two weeks... then I walked 10 kilometres, after slowly working up to that with restorative yoga, and today I just went for a fairly long bike ride. I'm going to be exercising daily for sure and if I get any cravings the rest of the year I am totally taking some sort of psychedelic because I am NOT going back to that fucking bullshit. It was the most miserable, fucking misery I think I have ever experienced! Not the whole time it was wonderful at first of course but after five years my life was utterly ruined. 


Yeah like I don't plan on abusing psychedelics, but I am interested in taking a higher dose of DMT next time (maybe 80mg as opposed to 50) and well I definitely wouldn't take any more AL-LAD than that haha. Had my fair share of that and yeah so my 1500 microgram trip was in pretty serious withdrawal still. I was bedridden, and the drug gave me energy to walk that 10km and I was sweating buckets. That is some fun detox right there, I'm feeling wonderful now but I know it won't last. Every day is different and I am gonna have to be patient. Psychedelics have been a bigger help than I ever would have thought. 


I confronted my addiction during this trip. I was like yo, if you're gonna quit, if you ever are actually going to, why not now? It's always tomorrow, because you never want to suffer through it. I was at 2 weeks when I tripped and I was still physically sick, I was having extreme cravings, something needed to be done and I have a sheet of AL-LAD so I just took ten of them and had one of the wildest days and nights of my life. I haven't had a craving since. In fact I am furious at myself for using that disgusting dope. I'm quitting pot too. Everything has to go except for psychedelics and the odd benzo when I have a panic attack. 


Thanks though guys since that motivated me to keep clean, and it is not easy after being on heroin constantly for a really long time. I can't hold a glass of ice water without feeling like it's a winter night in Canada without gloves on. There are so many things wrong with my body but ever since this trip I've been relentless about getting over it.

Yeah, exercise is important for sure.  Actually just in general, your life feels a lot better when you're physically fit.  But yeah isn't it crazy how horrible opiate addiction feels?  I was on them for 10 years, I only did heroin for a while, it was kratom for years (taking a fucking lot of it many times a day, I'd wake up at 6am every day with my legs unable to stay still and my nose running and feeling the despair), and then I was on poppy tea for years.  I liked poppy tea more than heroin (I never IVd though), and honestly the withdrawal wasn't worse with it, I felt sicker and it lasted longer but I was less restless.  With kratom I would get restless BODY syndrome, I would lay awake all night in bed, thrashing my legs and arms too uncontrollably, sometimes I'd punch my leg as hard as I could for like 10 seconds straight until it went numb and I got 30 seconds of relief.  At some point I would just start screaming, the feeling was so overwhelmingly maddening, and usually by day 5 I'd break down from lack of sleep.  I'm prone to restless legs anyway, as a kid I had them a lot, especially at night, and I HATE HATE HATE that feeling.  With kratom it spread into my arms equally badly, I've never experienced that except with heavy kratom withdrawal.  With poppy tea it was just a need to squirm, not nearly as restless.


But yeah, I experienced a lot of those, but for 2 weeks I was visiting my family and my oldest and closest friend was also there.  I was of course on poppy tea, and he was really on heroin, and I decided to try it.  Every couple of days we'd drive into the city and score some.  I didn't have any poppy tea with me so I was just doing heroin (nasally).  I started to feel those withdrawals, and there is something uniquely terrible about them.  There's this darkness there, this apathy, that was really bad to me.


Anyway yeah, I had resigned myself to being on them life, I tried so hard for so long, I did manage to quit for 8 months once and I still went back.  I wanted to die I was so miserable, and I basically hated myself because, like you said, it's always tomorrow that you'll quit.  I betrayed myself every day, it started to fuck with my head a lot.  Plus I was in an abusive relationship which was ultimately the reason my addiction had gotten so bad, because I was trying to hide from it.  I was fantasizing about how to die because it was a strange sort of mini-relief from the despair... ahh, that would be so nice to stop existing.


Then the relationship ended, and I started to come out of my cloud, spend time with friends, life my own life and not be an an emotional slave experiencing stockholm syndrome anymore.  I was still addicted, and still having a lot of trouble with it, but I decided I needed to just make it happen for myself, because I felt excited about the future, but I knew opiates would prevent it from manifesting good things.  I started to think about ibogaine, and over 2 months it turned from a passing thought to a fully researched and planned idea, into reality.  I did a flood dose at home with supervision, and it changed everything for me.  It interrupted my negative patterns basically, on some deep, semi-conscious way.  It sounds like you've experienced a trip that has interrupted negative patterns for you too. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  I experienced some light residual withdrawal symptoms after the dust settled, and it was hard to sleep for months because I'd get a bit restless but only at night, but I honestly didn't care, it was like, dude, you were insane for 10 years of your life, you'd have to be an idiot to go there.  I haven't had a craving since, it's been 3.5 years.  I also started exercising and making sure I was eating well, and I identified things in my life that weren't working for me and things that I wanted or needed (not material things but activities, people, stuff like that), and made some changes.  I basically altered my lifestyle in the ways I felt I should.  It sucks that you can't help that you have chronic pain. ![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif)  But always just remember the fact that the most abject misery you've ever experienced is the result of opiates, and that should be enough to remind yourself that it's not fucking worth it. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


Anyway... I finally made the investment and ordered a nice stash of both AL-LAD and ETH-LAD.  I'm pumped!  I've done AL-LAD in doses from 150-300ug a good handful of times and I love it, but I've only done ETH-LAD once and found it very interesting and nice.

Re: body load, I'm also shocked at what people say, less about AL-LAD and more about how it compares to LSD. For me, LSD has absolutely no body load even at 1000+ mcg doses, whereas 300 mcg of AL-LAD gave me one of the worst body loads I've ever had on a psychedelic. Individual differences, man.... The trip was still awesome in every other way though.

I found myself questioning the report as well, but not for that reason. I have so far found it to seem like a myth that increasing the dose to that level also increases the duration that much.... I've taken around 2000 mcg of LSD and still only peaked for four hours, and only had visuals and euphoria linger for a few hours longer than normal. I doubt there's any amount of these lysergamides you could take and genuinely trip for days, and I immediately doubt either the honesty or understanding of the subject of anyone who claims they have.

Oh yeah, there's individual differences for sure, and I think your metabolism theory is probably a pretty good guess. I also feel like my LSD trips and some other psychedelics too have gotten a little bit longer with age honestly, and I have spoken to others who said the same thing about their trips, and I would suppose that could be related to changing metabolism too.


I do find duration to increase slightly with the dose, just not anywhere near to the degree that would be required for that, it's really no different than the way it's worked for basically any other drug for me. So, I wouldn't be surprised if every so often the right combination of slow metabolism and high dose has produced an LSD trip lasting a full twenty-four hours, maybe even a bit more, but *days?* Nah, I'm not buying it.... Maybe you'll have HPPD for that long, but not actual trips.

There's another massive overdose report, where the person is back down after 8 hours: [https://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=102145](https://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=102145)

The way I understand dosage and duration is that they are only slightly interrelated. Increased dosage merely increases magnitude of effects, which can slightly increase duration indirectly. I wrote this analogy a long time ago in BL, and it seemed to resonate (pun intended) so I'll repeat it now:


Imagine you strike a bell. It will sound, and gradually diminish until silence. Now if you strike it twice as hard, it will sound much louder, and take longer to diminsh because it started out louder, hence a little longer to settle down to silence. The sound isn't going to sustain for twice as long. It will basically decay at the same rate towards silence, but it will remain above the audible threshold for longer just because of being louder in the first place.


Drugs work more or less like that. 


Exceptions might be when exceeding certain thresholds use up all of an enzyme like MAO for example, and then your body takes a longer to replenish that enzyme. Not really sure if that ever happens, but I can imagine it happening with something that requires hefty dosages like mescaline. Pure speculation - don't treat that conjecture as anything like a fact.

Xorkoth I can relate to a lot of what you are saying. Congrats on quitting by the way, I will soon be there myself. I don't think anything can stop me I'm just so fucking done with that evil drug. I was in a shit relationship too, by the end of it she had no respect left for me and it had been five years. She was fuelling my drug use, absolutely as she was beginning to constantly stress me out. The way it ended was awful, and fucked me up for a while. This was just last autumn as well and I started using way more H at that point since I just didn't see that breakup coming at all. 


And yeah it's like, there are some residual withdrawal symptoms left but they are so easy to ignore now. I feel like my mind has been reset, and since I was practically out of withdrawal, why ever go back to that Hell. It is truly hell that place. You don't see it coming before it's too late. It's not worth it at all and I'm so done. Being bedridden for two weeks when I'm not quite 30 years old yet is fucking ridiculous and I have a lot of weight to gain back. 


Its not even just that either, it's everything: my career, my health, my relationships, my hobbies. I feel that my thoughts on everything are changing after the trip. I didn't even plan it either... I was so sick of the withdrawal, laying in bed depressed all day, that I just took the ten hits. Ever since I've been spending my days out of bed, going biking, I went to the mall, like I am actually doing stuff that will help me recover, and yoga will help a lot too. All of those things like just moving around and eating healthy will help my endorphins rebuild as opposed to laying in bed depressed. I even think it's possible that down the road I might not have chronic pain anymore. I am working on strengthening my core at the moment. 


The worst part for me is how I have so much time to make up for, I am so motivated in a lot of different respects, but in withdrawal I couldn't help but, as you say, toss and turn in bed, soaking the sheets through, shitting myself, vomiting, etc. for TWO WEEKS like it was just fucking crazy how bad something could feel. I think it should be called restless body syndrome and then there are the full body muscle aches that make me feel like my nerves in my upper arms are burning alive. And yeah, I can relate to the feeling of just wanting to scream; feeling trapped, like it's never going to end. Although I guess I was pretty high (I always sniffed H, apart from 4 injections this year). 


I haven't been depressed since, which is remarkable. 4 days now since the trip. I've actually been doing stuff too. Pretty exciting these changes! : ) I hope they stick around and honestly I think they will.

Awesome man, I bet they will too. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  Good job.  It's good you're doing stuff to replenish your endorphins.  Like I said, exercise is so crucial right now, so I'm glad you're getting out and doing it.  make sure to eat well too, that really helps you feel better.  As in, lots of vegetables, fruits, and protein of some sort that isn't factory farmed if possible.

Wow, really?  That sucks!  For me AL-LAD is definitely more present in the body than LSD, but I find it very pleasurable.  LSD also has virtually no bodyload for me, it feels primarily transparent, like there isn't a chemical affecting my body.  AL-LAD produces an obvious body effect, for fortunately, for me it's really pretty wonderful-feeling.

I think this is because lysergamides have very short half-lives, you're still tripping after it's eliminated from your body (if I recall correctly, please correct me if I'm wrong).  This is contrast to some other drugs.  In general isn't it true that duration will be mediated by half-life?  So that if you take a lot more of something, then after one half-life it will still be present in sufficient quantities to still feel the drug, hence lasting longer than if you took less.  I know with the DOXs, people who take a lot more will trip a lot longer.  hence the stories of people tripping for days on DOM back in the 60s... they produced 15mg tabs (or was it 20mg)?  And people would take several and not come down for days.

All that stuff to replenish my endorphins started happening after my trip as well. I feel like the trip started it because it went on for so long and for a huge part of it after the peak I was walking around outside (something I hadn't done in like... 2 weeks at least, seriously). And I got really hungry from that and started eating again and kept everything going. 

Before then I was having trouble walking around the gardens out back or even getting a glass of juice. I am cooking again. I'm still struggling a bit with appetite but I got right to the cycling and long walking and now yoga. Keeping hydrated too and managing to sleep well. I just got groceries the other day too so I have valerian for sleep, whey protein powder, lots and lots of fruit and veggies. Pretty much my whole life is centred around recovery right now and that isn't going to change because why ruin my life with dope, I'd rather have back pain (which might actually go away in time if I am less sedentary about it). 

Thanks man, I'm curious to see how long this goes on for. I was feeling like complete shit and I have no complaints now at all, maybe a little nausea but I'll have some ginger for that. A few days ago I was in a hopeless hell. If I get cravings in some days time, I'll smoke DMT again. Wiped me out much less than this stuff but I needed to trip heavily and for long.

This is mostly true. For most drugs the half-life is going to be greater than the duration of effects- so you stop feeling it well before ~1/2 of your dose is eliminated. For LSD though, this is the opposite: the half life is about 3.6h, but the drug effects can last for almost 3x that duration! [A study was just published in Cell](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2016.12.033) this year that shows that LSD has very slow dissociation kinetics from the 5-HT2A/2B receptors, which could explain it's extremely duration.

Has anyone noticed a pattern with headaches after Al-Lad?

I note that I get a headache 2 out of 3 times after Al-Lad  at any dose, high or low, mixed or not mixed with other lysergamides.

**I cannot completely rule out the after effect of wine and/or raki (alcoholic grape distillate),.**

I usually drink something to cover for my being mentally unusual or "fluffy" in a group.


Last night I had a bit of 1p (-30mics @ 5pm) mixed with Al (- 50mics @6pm) some raki (2oz) at 5:15pm and some white wine at 5:30PM (4 oz) 

This produced a very social and euphoric relief with family members after a very hard week of computer software architecture consulting.

I had about a liter of coconut water through the evening.


Later @9:30 I had some hashish (2 tokes from vape pen) but the headache had already started - and it carried through until 7:am. even with tylenol and advil.


Most relief was felt this morning after using OPTREX brand eye wash (witchhazel in water), and a big coffee.


Next time I will avoid alcohol when putting Al-Lad into my system (at least 3 next times, so I can eliminate the effect of alcohol)

^^^ I've noticed it happens to me often when I drink and use cannabis with certain psychedelics, especially on a mixtures of tryptamines or lysergamides with phenethylamines. I think the headache has something to do with blood pressure inside the head or at least that's my gut feel for it.

So with the known combos (that includes AL-LAD) I simply avoid using too much cannabis and avoid alcohol. 


My remedy is usually a mixture of kratom and mate teas, Palmitoylethanolamide, Magnesium Citrate and Agmatine. Ibuprofen goes next if nothing helps.


Also theoretically preloading with some blood thinners like Aspirin or garlic extracts would help with this issue I think. I've tried garlic so far and it seems to help ease off the load on blood vessels.


But even eliminating alcohol might already be enough and definitely worth trying! ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

LSD also has virtually no bodyload for me, it feels primarily transparent, like there isn't a chemical affecting my body.  AL-LAD produces an obvious body effect, for fortunately, for me it's really pretty wonderful-feeling.

Yeah, it does. ![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif) You should definitely feel lucky about that. If it wasn't for the body load I honestly think AL-LAD would be one of my very top favorite psychedelics, it was fantastic in every other way and I want to say aside from that actually possibly the most euphoric drug I've ever taken. Hopefully I can figure out a way around it with future trials, as I did just a get bit more of it to stock up on....

Well I ate a quarter of mushrooms last night and it destroyed me. I think I experienced ego death (something like that, maybe not all the way... it was just a quarter but it rocked me). My trip was a blank slate of conscious experience. Then my logic came back and I couldn't figure anything out. Straight up confusion. I got in a thought loop like, I just can't fucking figure it out and it's right in front of my face, I just don't understand, I am using my fucking physics logic like what the fuck?? I couldn't have told you my name, or anything at all about myself, only speak or write using logic. I don't get it, I was kinda starting to freak out and then my hot new friend who I am completely falling in love with helped me remember that I was 'Shroomy'. She's just like... did you eat all those mushrooms you had? I'm like OHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH and then I kept forgetting for a while but everything started coming back - oh right, language. I speak english. I've been using it this whole time. I felt like I was creating my own reality. Eventually I remembered everything about who I was again and then I had a cute chat with my cute new friend who is just so fucking amazing. I am glad I got off opiates because I never would have met her if I hadn't. 


Ten hits of al-lad was really intense too but in a different way, far more visual and far less mindfuck. The shroomies are always the little fuckers that get me. I couldn't even speak, and I was having trouble moving. It was actually kind of hard on my body and I'm sleeping today off. No more psychedelics for a while haha. I've been clean a good while and I've had these high dose trips. And I'm kinda preoccupied with this whole romance thing she has been AMAZING so far : )

Hell yeah man, talk about a boost to helping you be happy with your life apart from opiates!  A new romance you feel awesome about is one of the most sublime things in the world. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


I'm gonna take 300ug of this tonight, gonna jam with my band and hang out and finish mixing our last EP.  I've been coming off phenibut, it's been 16 days, and to help deal with it I've been drinking more often than usual.  I'm pretty sure it's making it worse, but band days are the biggest trigger for me because everyone else is drinking.  I'm hoping AL-LAD will not only provide a fun state of mind conducive to music that isn't alcohol, but that I will get something from it.  Honestly half the reason is because I love AL-LAD and I just got my order in yesterday, I really just want to taste it again, it's been years. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

We both can't stop thinking about each other : ) it's really really nice. She's visiting family but I will get to see her again soon and it's like, still progressing in my opinion. Even just thinking about her and we talk every day too and I just can't wait to see her again. She helped me realize I was on shrooms yesterday haha. Cutest chick I have connected with on this level by far and we are both in our prime, 30, so it's just sweet and she's totally giving me a bit of a break for the next couple weeks because I have been completely honest with what is going on with me good and bad. 


These trips are helping too but like when the right girl comes along all randomly when I'm a recovering junkie and she's actually chill and right for me I wasn't even looking haha I met her on a ten strip of this stuff (the al-lad) when I was coming off that journey. We have had to talk a lot about stuff. I just was blown away not expecting that to happen at all I wasn't looking and she has been amazing. It's like it really couldn't be better right now and it's like she came like magic into my life at just the right time and if I fuck this up doing dope again I will be the biggest fool who ever lived because she is special this one and she's being patient with me as I continue to withdraw. She just wants to hang out and chill anyway so it's not like she's pushing me too hard yet, apart from when we get at each other hehe but even then cause of Low-T levels I'm like fuck. She is being so good to me I really appreciate her. 


That's awesome man have fun! Sounds like a fun night, and a solid dose. I play a lot of post-hardcore guitar. I've been having really high dose trips lately because I'm just not getting it. And it's right in front of my eyes, I just need to be a better person. I feel reborn in a way. I need to hammer the message into my head and AL-LAD, mushrooms and DMT have all helped. But then that cutie came along and like it's pretty serious so I have to get a little more real for a while. She smokes chron and is overall very relaxing to spend time with so that will totally help out my recovery too. It's also good to be getting laid in opiate recovery because my testosterone levels are so low. I've blown my mind with psychs enough for a couple weeks so it's time to chill. Maybe write some music, start doing stuff again but that quarter of mushrooms laid me out man and then built be back up. Chilling out today, I need a rest after those mushrooms as I was having an identity crisis but I feel like I need a rest in general right now. I'm being too hard on myself. 


I just got some Norflurazepam yesterday and I'm liking it so far. My head is scrambled from the shrooms man they take more out of me than any psychedelic. Fucking tough trip.

Dude, it sounds a lot like my situation.  I got off opiates and got out of my abusive marriage, and like 5 months after opiates/7 months after my ex left, I met this super cute girl and we just clicked.  It's been almost 3 years and we're still really into each other.  I was really honest with her on our first date about what I had gone through, and everything else, it really allowed us to form a connection quickly.  Even though we kept it casual on the surface for a while, it was intense.  Still is. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  I unexpectedly started crying while I was driving away when she went to California for 2 months, only 2 and a half weeks after we met.  Turns out she thought about me the whole time and vice versa. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  We've never even gotten in a fight ever this whole time, it's crazy.


Watch out with the benzos.  I've been off opiates for almost 3.5 years, but after a while the GABA drugs crept up on me.  Shit's also really bad to get dependent on and benzos are tricky bastards.

Man I can relate to everything you are saying. It's happening so fast but it's like the more we get to know each other the more we are inseparable. She's out visiting her family for a few days and honestly I miss her. She wants to come home a day early so we have a few days to spend together. It has been wonderful. I know when I like a girl. She's about to give me a call. Like I can't even wait to hear her voice... it's crazy. Oh man I can't see us fighting. Just straight up honesty and we're both chill people. 


She is really book smart like she's that cutie who has been hiding out in the library and wants a relationship now and I want a serious one too. I really appreciate that she is even giving me a chance considering the heroin and all that shit. I fucked up so bad. She's like the opposite of hardcore heroin withdrawal lol. 


I was also in a toxic relationship around 6 months ago that went on for 5 years so like I know what I want now and I learned a lot. She's pretty much in the same situation. I'm trying to keep it casual, but we can't pretend. 


Oh ya man I have a real nasty panic disorder and the benzos are creeping up on me a bit. It's the next logical thing to address when I've been clean from opiates for a while. I use long acting ones and should be able to do a really slow taper. 


Man you gave us hope. It feels odd you know? Like... isn't it supposed to take a while? I'm becoming more and more confident about this and well, she is totally into me so that's nice too : ) I honestly couldn't be happier I'm sitting here hungover from a quarter of shrooms and still kicking from a recent oxycodone slip... and it's totally cool because we're about to talk and it's gonna be sweet! She's really smart. I straight up just completely respect her. How could I ever get mad at her after giving me a chance like this... I'm not the only guy here. I've just been straight up about everything and then she is doing the same and it is wonderful. I can't wait to see her tomorrow.


I was talking to her on AL-LAD (my 1500ug trip) and she wants to try it. She thinks it sounds like a good substance for finding answers. I've never had a girl who smoked chron let alone tripped out so that is sweet too! Thanks man you actually gave me hope. I've been questioning this so much because it's like I KNOW what's going on here but it's almost too incredible to be true. That's kinda why I took the quarter of mushrooms last night and we bonded a lot talking on the phone since she's visiting her parents. I can't wait until she's back but I don't think I'd give her a 10 strip to start. I personally am finding high dose trips easier to handle than low or medium dose ones these days, it's weird. Oh, but I got my ass handed to me by that quarter of mushrooms ahaha. 


I'm gonna get out of this fucking swamp one step at a time. Dude and you made me realize this is totally possible. If it happened to you right and it really seems similar, especially the previous abusive relationship when I was abusing heroin myself and like it was just so fucking bad back then.

Heh, no, don't give her a 10 strip.  My advice is to let her decide when to trip with no pressure, and give her a low dose to start because you don't know how she'll react.  My girl has tripped with me a couple of times now, when she took acid for the first time (with me ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)) she knew I had some, and she just came over one day and was like, let's eat acid this weekend.  We did, I gave her 125ug, and she loved it but it was almost too strong at the beginning.  She handled it well and went on to have a good trip, but just saying.  Just because you/I can take a lot of psychedelics doesn't mean she can.  I'd give her 1 tab to start if she's like, "let's do AL-LAD this weekend" or whatever.


My suggestion is to be excited, but also just chill and let it happen.  Don't try to define anything forcibly.  My girl and I never even had the define the relationship talk, eventually after like a year I realized I'd be wanting to tell her I loved her for months, so finally I did and she returned the sentiment.  Gradually we started talking about marriage (or in our case, not getting married) and kids and stuff.  But it all happened slowly and organically, and in the meantime we just enjoyed each others' company.  We both knew how each other felt because it was clear as day through the way we were/are with each other.


By the way I met my girl when I was 31, so about your age... she was 28.  It's cool meeting people when you're not so young anymore because you've both already worked through (hopefully) a lot of that ego stuff. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Dude that is amazing advice and it's what is going on. It's just happening like an acid trip man and flowing organically it really is and that is honestly so rare for me with this. I was just on the phone with her for around an hour and it was wonderful. I think we just both understand that we want the same things. I'm 29 and she is 30. We are really enjoying ourselves at the moment in fact she is leaving a day early to come chill with me and I'm like no no stay and have fun but I think she knows what she wants. We'll have a couple more days together and we are still figuring out all the hobbies and stuff we are going to get up to... other than a lot of sex which again is just flowing organically. I'm not even really meaning for it to happen. It's amazing. 


Oh and I'd never do that hehe. Good hard reduction advice. I don't really give people psychedelics; over the past 3 or 4 years I have only tripped by myself. If she brought it up I'd do the same thing, and make sure to have a benzo just in case. I don't even necessarily want her to trip out with me but I love smoking weed with her cause I've never had a girl who liked chron. She has better pot than all my stoner buddies and that's... sexy lol. And yeah man I have to be excited and she's the type that like I totally need to let her know and take control a bit but also, I'm sure as fuck not scaring her away. I didn't bring out the whole drug issue at once, for example. We're slowly getting to know each other, and really enjoying it so much. I don't think the word relationship has been mentioned, but we both know what we want or we wouldn't have made it this far. 


Yeah man fuck that ego youngin stuff. I would finally say that I am a humble man. After chronic pain leading to a heroin habit I have been very humbled. I really hope I never ever go back because I still have cravings. I would have said that I was humble before too, but I just wasn't at all. I had a total ego in my early 20's. I haven't lost it completely but if I can get off a 5 year heroin habit, get my career going again and have a beautiful chick in the meantime then I must be doing something right. I think I'm going to keep smoking DMT... little easier on the body than these repetitive high dose acid and mushroom trips in withdrawal haha.


You are giving me hope!!! And it was really cute I thought how it just came out I told her I miss her which is so weird. She's only gone a few days and she's like I miss you too I think about you way too much. But it wasn't like it was weird or anything even though... you know? Like it's kind of fast but we just click so well it is hard to believe. It's just like I totally get that she misses me too and then she confirms it and it's so sweet to me. I also think that we both have really important life lessons to offer each other and I feel like she is full of cute little surprises. It doesn't hurt that she is kinky as fuck as well. I feel like she's been in the library the past 5 years lol, she is a total bookworm but I find she is really smart in ways that I'm not. And then I got that technical shit covered. Last night I could do fucking quantum physics calculations but I wouldn't have been able to tell you my name, or that I was a human on planet earth or where I was. It was sooooo frustrating. 


Mushrooms kick my ass more than anything else. I'd totally take 10 AL-LAD blotters over a quarter of that stuff again hehehe. And I totally feel like I can tell the difference between shrooms, 4-ho-met, and 4-aco-dmt pretty damn easily.

Hey I somehow missed this, thanks! I've been doing great so far. 


Also Xorkoth thanks for the warning about the gaba drugs man. Like I didn't already subconsciously know. I'm already on a taper schedule now and I think I have enough long acting benzos to taper down a bit and then switch to my diazepam script. I get really bad panic attacks mainly since I had untreated chronic pain in my spine for over 2 years, then got fed up once those started, the doctors didn't do anything for me and became a junkie. I never really abuse benzos but it's sure not good to be on them so long. If I don't take them I feel like I am having a heart attack perpetually and even before I started on them so it's tough.

 I do abuse them sometimes in post-acute heroin withdrawal, and in the end, when I was very sick. Which I am presently in PAWS symptoms, so it was also a wakeup call. I'm dealing with the anxiety and making sure it doesn't get too intense. I could use a nice hoppy beer, I haven't had one since I got on benzos several years ago. Not sure if they are good to mix or what my reaction to alcohol would be now. My little bro plays in a band and I want to form my own sorta post-hardcore one someday. I'm already teaching my cute new friend piano (I don't play it myself haha so I am learning along the way, but I play electric guitar and know enough music theory to transfer it) and she is teaching me a second language. 

I was so worked up about H that I forgot I have to taper off those too and like if not today then when? I kept telling myself on that quarter of shrooms the other day, like I'm just not getting it, I'm just not getting it. I think I am though... I am already having a panic attack but I am going to wait four hours to dose. Off topic man I know but I have a couple sheets of Al-lad to go through so I'm sure I'll be writing here again. ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif) Plus I must be heading in the right direction somehow if I have another date lined up quite soon, but I don't want to ruin my life with this shit.


I think I'll go with 300 mics of this next time, but if one has not tried it I'd start with 150 mics to be on the safe side trying a new psychedelic. Amazing psychedelic though.

Well honestly if you're on a low dose to treat underlying anxiety, I would wait to taper until you're clear of opiates and PAWS.  In fact either way I'd say wait, you're going to have a much harder time if you try to get off both at once.  I thought maybe you were just getting into the habit of taking benzos to deal with opiate withdrawal and if that was the case and you weren't dependent yet or just a little I was gonna say to cut it off at the pass now... but if you're already physically dependent and have been for some time, I'd definitely take it one thing at a time.  I'll say, definitely only take them when you need to, don't make it worse by increasing your usage.

Exactly man, I've always been okay with my benzos, but my dose has been creeping up this year because whenever I was really getting heroin sick I would take extras, I was just not thinking straight at all, and now my tolerance is a little higher. I'm not going to fuck up and take even more for opiate post-acute panic attacks when, if I can just wait long enough, I will stabilize and then I can taper off my benzos next. I gotta realize man like I'm actually going to get better, and I already am! I jammed my guitar for half an hour today, and did half an hour of yin yoga. I even held a downward dog for 5 minutes and physically I haven't been eating, I've lost a lot of weight. So mainly restorative yoga asanas. I cooked a veggie pasta, that is huge for me, to have an appetite these days. That is really an accomplishment for me at this point of my life. I took some Valerian phytocaps (highly recommended) that mellowed me out a little and now it's just an hour until the time I will take my benzo. I'm in a bit of a panic, but it's not so bad. I can hold off for sure, yoga really helped actually. I heard a cold wet towel on the forehead helps too, I should try that. I really like Valerian though, it's totally nature's valium. 


I'm handling the most anxiety that I can right now, but I shouldn't be so hard on myself. It has been tough enough to be quitting a 5 year heroin habit. And yeah man like spot on, wait until I'm really anxious, then wait longer until I really am like  fuck I need this right now so that I'm at least getting used to dealing with my panic. Not like... I'm dope sick so I'm taking a benzo. None of that. Nor, I'm tripping out super hard so I'm taking a benzo. There has been none of that either, I definitely think I'm on the right track. Main thing right now is no more heroin ever again so long as I live, and once that is said and done, I can taper off my anxiety meds. I also started off my opiate free journey with a taper plan, and a diary with a schedule listing time / dose / reason ... so I already have a little practice (I'm obviously going to have to taper the benzos, so it's good I get diazepam). Thanks by the way. I was actually just thinking that I'm being really a little too hard on myself. Things are going fast enough with my new cute lady friend like damn man where has my patience for some of these things. I'm going to get better and psychedelics are totally helping too... I'm thinking of trying Ibogaine next. I have Iboga total alkaloid extract, and a gram of pure ibogaine but I really want to research it, and microdosing too. I honestly think I can do it on my own from here on out though.

Sounds like you're definitely on the right track. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


Ibogaine changed my life.  The biggest thing it did for me regarding opiates was remove my cravings, I have never had another craving which is incredible, miraculous because I had quit up to 8 months before, got back to feeling A-okay, and then I had a craving, went with it.... and 4 more years of even worse misery.


I will say though, that you really really need to prepare, and you ***NEED*** to have supervision.  Ibogaine is not like other trips, you will not be able to take care of yourself.  Someone needs to be around to make sure things are okay, the whole time.  For most people it lasts about a day but for me it lasted 3 full days, on the 3rd day I thought I was with it but I was actually dreaming while awake and I did some crazy stuff that could have resulted in bad things.  If you decide to go that route, please PM me and we can talk, having been through an at-home ibogaine flood dose, I know a lot and I really feel it's very important to know as much as you can and really be prepared.  It's a huge commitment, it goes far beyond a psychedelic trip.  Microdosing is also an option.  I will say, the flood changed my life in so many ways, it basically reset my brain (it felt like) so I was not imprinted in my bad habits, not just opiates but in every area of my life.  That allowed me to choose to establish good habits instead.  It was like I woke up from a long nightmare of insanity my life had become, and I was just ME again, the core me, the real me, the empowered me.


I would say that as time goes on, if you're struggling, think about a flood dose.  Don't just do it now, it seems like you're on the right path.  Ibogaine is a big decision.

Hey man, I was really struggling this morning. I woke up infuriated, freaking out, having a panic attack. I'm really nervous specifically about performance anxiety because I took a few percocet last time and like it was soooooooo good but I can't last for shit now I don't have any opiates and I don't have any fuckin testosterone. 


So I smoked some DMT out of my dab rig... 50mg but the vapour was harsh this time because I didn't wait long enough for the nail to cool down and then carb cap it but yeah like I still got the majority of the smoke. This trip, it was like asking myself questions and being real with myself and it was just me giving the answers I would give myself. No entity contact or anything like that this time... not really anyway. 


I've worn myself to the fcking ground and I think the only psychedelic I will use in the near future is DMT. Every time has been serene, wonderful, enlightening, consciousness shifting, tranquil... it's my kind of psychedelic for sure. The answer was simple - just have a morning chat with her before we chill later and it's totally fine. It's post acute symptoms fucking with me and it's like I want to perform like before but not take any fucking opiates ever again. 


Man I would flood dose it because all my most enlightening trips have been heavy ones. I feel like what you were describing happened to you has already started with me, I am just not quite there yet. I could never handle ibogaine right now but I definitely want to try it in the future (not even really for addiction issues, I'm just really curious about how it kind of looks like 5-meo-dmt and the natural ones are the best I find). 


Even microdosing made me realize I was abused as a kid... it's powerful shit that's for sure. I am so not ready for that flood dose man. I'm packing a bag of fun stuff for my little date, and the message I got from the DMT trip was just like if you are this fucking worried just talk to her about it, so I did for an hour and she was super understanding. I need to give myself some time! And communicate what is going on to people close to me. 


Whenever I'm really freaking out, DMT calms me down in a way (I definitely get prepared for the trip first). I'm sticking with that for now because 15 minutes is just enough time in psychedelia to keep me sane. I just need to give it time thanks for the advice by the way. I know I can do this it's pretty tough to get off heroin after so many years of being numb and not even knowing it.

Thanks for the suggestions. I am honestly doing so much better : ) the joy of life was right in front of my eyes and I couldn't fucking see it. The girl I'm seeing just told me she can't believe how much better I'm doing since we met. I can't either - but I've been hiking for exercise, I've been extremely physically active for how weak I've been feeling, my diet is superb, I have really been fighting hard and straight up cold turkey, never again type of thing. I have to get off benzos next and it is terrifying me as I have horrific panic attacks sometimes where for hours on end I feel my heart being squeezed in a fucking vice like I'm having a heart attack and that was *before* I got on them. I'm horrified and if anyone has been through benzo withdrawal, and wouldn't mind talking a little about it with me please don't hesitate to pm me. I already have a few friends to talk to but this is serious. I'm really really scared about that and just went through heroin withdrawal. This scares me so much more and I need to do it right away before it gets any worse. 


To get on topic (and I have a question, I don't mean to derail thread haha, I'm just a dumbass like that), does anyone know if the blotters are evenly laid? I heard that like 4 of them were tested  and the microgram amount varied? I know there is or was a slight controversy over this...

There was a research article about AL-LAD and LSZ where they tested some blotters and found a wide variation in dosages. I made a post about it in this thread a few pages back. The research was done back when AL-LAD had recently appeared on the market though. They manufactures could have improved their blotter laying technique since then. I haven't seen any test results for newer batches.

I have heard the batches out now suck because I think it's all old stock and it has deffinetly oxidized some I think. I wish one last batch could be laid from some Crystal.  It's so friggin expensive I honestly don't want a weak batch. :-/

I stored some in airtight, arid, subzero conditions for about 3 years, and it came out every bit as potent as when I put it in (subjectively). It would be a shame if the vendors aren't storing it in similar conditions.

Yeah I wonder if they might have had a problem from constantly taking from a large batch and not thawing it out slowly leading to mositure degredation but honestly I have no clue. I just know the general consensus for the brown paper batch that is out now isn't very good especially in regards to consistency.

I tried AL-LAD for the first time over the weekend.


Took 300µg AL-LAD in two blotters orally, chewed and swallowed.


I started to get some onset effects after 15-20 minutes.

After 6 hours I was pretty much back to baseline and starting to fall asleep.


I had hoped for a better experience from this stuff. It is pretty gentle on the body and mind. I felt like my brain had been plugged in and electrified for a few hours, then unplugged before I later went to sleep. I did experience a decent amount of visuals but nothing spectacular. Watching TV felt like I was there in real life, the scenes had a 3D depth to them that isn't normally there. There were also tracers, a bit of patterning overlay, and color enhancement. I didn't notice much in audio enhancement or mental activity though. On the plus side, I laughed my ass off a lot.


Throughout most of the trip, I felt a strange sensation on my tongue, almost like it had disappeared back into my throat and chest. While contemplating this, I started to have a moment during a conversation with my wife where I knew what she was going to say and how I would respond to it a couple minutes before it actually happened. When it did happen, I had taken a drink of water and ended up almost choking on it because the weird sensation on my tongue messed with my swallowing ability. I felt like I could have choked on my tongue a few different times throughout the night as well.


Also, this gave me more jaw tension than what is normally comfortable with the other lysergamides. It reminded me of how I felt after taking some ecstasy pills many years ago. I had no idea what was actually in those pills but the jaw tension made my mouth feel smaller, tighter, and harder to stretch out for a couple days after. AL-LAD did something similar to me.


I ended up eating more food than I thought I would, as this drug had no effect on suppressing my appetite. I also felt fuzzy headed throughout the trip, unlike my experiences with ALD-52 and 1P-LSD that make me extremely clear headed. Both my wife and I had an annoying sensitivity to light and sound by the tail end of the trip (she took 150µg) that made it difficult to relax. It caused her to become nauseous. I experienced no afterglow from this drug and actually felt quite sluggish the next day. I ended up taking some 1P-LSD and ETH-LAD the next day just to clear my head up and give me an energy boost.


I have a couple tabs left that I'll save for a rainy day, but will most likely not buy anymore of this stuff. I enjoy much more the mental and spiritual work I'm able to do with other lysergamides. AL-LAD just made me feel like I had gotten drunk the night before.

Tried this material for the first time last WE, took 300µg and GOD ! absolute bliss, lot of euphoria, not a single moment of anxiety, very recreational material, come up veery smooth and vusually fantastic !

From all lysergamides that i've tried I found that this one has the most sides effect on me: some tremors on my legs, a slight difficulty to speak correctly, a somehow reduced ability to control my mouvements, and the muscles of my abdomen was contracted the whole time.. has anyone noticed such sides effect? also the day after i was really exhausted and slept for more than 12 hours !!

I find that AL-LAD has the worst bodyload of all the lysergamides I've tried (LSD, 1A-LSD, ETH-LAD). It's hard to describe, but my body feels "blurry", entire abdomen feels bloated and alien, speech is impaired (also find myself desperately trying to complete half-formed words/phrases that keep looping in my head), constantly feel like I have hair stuck on my tongue (LOL), hot flushes & profuse sweating, etc. It's not just you.

Tried 1tab ethlad + 1tab allad with slight tolerance (last trip 9 days before using tryptamines) in hope of having great visuals, it turns that this combo gives way less visuals than 2 tab ethlad or 2 tabs allad :/

IME when mixing lysergamides (or any psychedelics really), its way better to make a balance towards one.

AL-LAD is a weird one that it needs to be a leading substance, so I would take 1,5 hits of AL-LAD with a half of hit of ETH-LAD for a strong trip with visuals. I always like adding a little bit of ETH-LAD to my AL-LAD trips.


I have had a very uncomfortable trip mixing 1 hit of each - ETH, AL and classic Lucy - it was very confusing, unstructured and uninteresting, thats when I came to conclusion that there must be a leader substance in every combo.

basically 300 mics of a potpourri.

next time the same potpourri wont be as unfamiliar, not that I would recommend this dose, you know I am a light head, rarely going up to or over 100ug al together, but I do get flustered a bit with a mix, which may be part of the fun, **facing something unexpected.**

Will be dosing 300mcg of AL-LAD tomorrow. Excited![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) I enjoyed the 200mcg I tried a few weeks ago.


Edit: Smooth sailing even with some cannabis mixed in![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) Increased visuals, thinking much less convoluted but distorted. Time is rather alien to me for some odd reason and I am trying figure out why I understand something alien. Am I tripping

Coming off of 300mcg that I took this morning. I was expecting it to be a bit *more* but what I got was nice. Some observations from my two trials so far:


This is really physically benign and transparent. I actually feel physically more comfortable on the drug than off it, which is rare for me on psychedelics. There was a brief period where a crampy body load emerged but that was like 15 minutes out of 10 hours of activity. I didn't notice a lot of visuals until at least 3 hours in. I felt spontaneous and adventurous, and at one time driven by compulsion. But overall I felt in control. Headspace was/is playful but lucid, with some valuable but not especially lifechanging introspection. Not a lot of time fuckery for me at this dosage, although the previous time I took it I felt some time dilation and easily became disoriented about the size of the space I was in. Sleep was not possible but a state a lot like it was, where a lot of creative and interesting thoughts washed over my semi-conscious mind while I rested. Mood was positive throughout, although there wasn't a feeling of boundless euphoria like I've had with phens. Overall my experience felt mild but extremely wholesome and healing. This is my second lysergamide experience overall and leaves me eager to explore some of the other lysergamides. Maybe ETH-LAD or 1P-LSD will be next (saving the reigning monarchs LSD and 1A-LSD for a truly special time).

I took some AL-LAD over the weekend that I purchased in 2014, and stored in the freezer until 2017. In 2017 after taking it out of the freezer, it seemed just as potent as when it was brand new. Then I left some tabs out of the freezer for the last year, and tried it again over the weekend, and it seems like it might have degraded a little bit, like say 20% lest potent. Hard to know for sure because trips can just vary randomly anyways, plus the tabs might not be evenly laid. But it might be worth keeping this one nice and chilly (and bone dry) for storage.

Yes, the lysergamides are very sensitive. I have my entire arsenal stored in the freezer in the long term.


I believe that the great variability of effects with AL-LAD is due to poor storage of the substance. There are people who say that it is not visual until you reach the 450ug ... well, for me 225ug were not overwhelming but there were very obvious hallucinations.

225ug was my dose this weekend too. I could see the hints of fractal geometry, tons of colour saturation and visual enhancement. Not overwhelming at all. I just remember if being *slightly* stronger at that dosage last year, but it is so subjective, really hard to say. In any case, I think it's a good idea to store it in the freezer, extremely dry.

I find AL-LAD to be incredbily euphoric, more so than LSD and going i the direction of a candyflip (LSD+MDMA) without the negative consequences.

Yeah AL-LAD is a gem.  I'm thinking of getting some more before it disappears forever, I've got about 20 hits left of 50 I would say.  It's so recreational and fun, and funny.  Very light and euphoric for sure.  I like it very much.

Wanted to let people know I've posted a TR detailing my thumbprint experience in the TR forum. link is [http://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads/847901-AL-LAD-thumbprint?p=14375813#post14375813](https://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads/847901-AL-LAD-thumbprint?p=14375813#post14375813)


I really love AL-LAD, ive had several experiences with it. My conclusion is while its a great compound. Theres really no need to push the dose past 450 mikes, it becomes way dreamier. Somehow I can take LSD much higher up to 1mg and remain lucid. past 450 mikes of AL it becomes less valuable to me. I've never taken a massive dose of LSD btw. Many more trip reports and comments to come I hope.

I'm going to catch up on this megathread soon but I wanted to ask a quick question:  I have the option of picking up AL-LAD and LSZ instead of LSD right now for the same price per sheet.  Should I go ahead and stock up or is there not much there compared to standard L?  Is it novel enough to justify buying a sheet just to have around in case it gets banned?

Dunno about LSZ but AL-LAD is different enough to warrant it.  Much more euphoric, and different visuals.  I am thinking of buying another sheet of it myself.  LSD is more something to do to go deep, but AL-LAD is one of the ultimate recreational substances.

That's interesting, a more fun/social LSD is something I'm interested in for sure.  I'll probably pick one up then.  I hate taking LSD in a social setting because I'm constantly focused on how other people are looking at me.  Always worried I'm going to say something weird or annoy people when I'm in thought loops.  When I finally get some I'll do a mild dose during a day with the family and let y'all know how it goes.

Yeah you should grab Al-lad if it's the same price as lsd. In 5 years you might not be able to get al-lad but you definitely will still find lsd. Al lad is a distinct and super fun acid variant. Everyone loves it. If you were purely interested in exotic then grab lsz cause its ultra rare now, but al lad was  better received in general. The one time I tried lsz it seemed cool. Maybe it's been overlooked. But probably you could stick with the consensus on this.

AL-LAD is one of the gems of the psych world, for sure. Lighter doses are fun and manageable, but bump that up a bit and it gets extremely weird, in a good way of course. Anything moving up to 300, 450, or 600 will put you on the moon. LSZ was an odd one, and I found it had quite a bit of bodyload, GI stuff, mostly, but when you moved up the ladder with it, it was much more LSD-like, and had an ominous head-space in my opinion. Sinister, might be a good way to put it.

I had some of the famously luckydip dosage original tabs that tests found from approx 156-216ug in 4 tabs but we strongly believe wider tests would have show even greater variation - someone required sedation of one tab that seemed way over the other times when it had been way over. A later batch from the same original source I was hoping were more accurate I tried at 300ug and it was barely above baseline so I have to conclude dosage seems near meaningless without some sort of reliable reference

I found 150ug to be barely noticeable.  300 was ok, but 450 was better.  600 was a solid dose, but breathing felt weird at times and I thought the dose might be a little high.


450ug of AL-LAD combined with 200ug of ETH-LAD was a serious experience.  I almost lost it on the come-up with all of the insect-like buzzing until I took a deep breath and let go.  My vision at times was all scrambled, like everything was pencil scribbles, and the environment was extremely distorted, as if I was looking out from inside of a prism.  There were times when I couldn't make out individual objects, just blobs. 


I had the sense that my brain's pattern matching and prediction algorithms were struggling to function.  It was like it kept trying to make sense of its inputs and predict what would happen next, but kept predicting incorrectly and trying to recover.  Like the mechanism was jammed.  I also had the strongest sensation that I was a program running on a computer that was malfunctioning.

Some kind of trip report: AL-LAD 150 mcg - Deep on two occations

I've got a broad and long exposure to many psychedelic tryptamines, ergolines and phenethylamines.

Just want to share a few observations from my 2 different 150 mcg experiences with AL-LAD regarding headspace/depth. The blotters had AL-LAD on one side and the molecule printed on the other side. They were slightly grayish, bought in 2018). I will not follow the standard trip report format with time stamps.


I've seen many contradictory reports regarding AL-LAD. Some get wild visuals and definitely some mind fuck from one 150 mcg tab, others need 2-3 tabs and some say hardly any mind fuck even then. Unevenly dosed blotters or individual differences in sensitivity? I don't know, but other blotters like ALD-52 - which seems to originate from the same place - have been very uniformly and accurately dosed in my experience.


Anyhow, my experiences from one AL-LAD trip this autumn and one recently are very similar.

On both trips I have fasted a few hours, pre-dosed with 1/2 g of phenibut 2-4 h before. 

Might have had very slight tolerance from some 2C-B or 2C-T-21 from 6-7 days before.

I've taken the AL-LAD around noon, alerts after 30-40 min, obvious effects after 60 min. Slight nausea - no other body load.

Visually some kind of light pastel color overlays in pink, light green and light turquoise. Slight underwater feeling, vivid imagination where I easily can see faces and figures in stones and roots etc.

Very slight waving/breathing/morphing of branches - similar to 15-17 mg 2C-B HBr for me. Definitely less visual than 20+ mg 2C-B HBr. 

Lots of smiling for no apparent reason, music sounds great – but not as fantastic as on LSD.

Head space is quite lucid, stream of thought is sped up - maybe like 30-40 mcg LSD. A bit easily distracted. Mydriasis is not obvious in good light, but can be seen in low light. Nothing extreme. No problem appearing sober in most circumstances. (But that is after +200 trips over 30+ years, so YMMV.)

Anyhow, on both trips, around the 4 hour mark, I start thinking of death and losses. A present theme as my mom has terminal cancer and a friend just passed away.

The first time I listened to - please indulge me, seemed very important to me - Nils Frahm's Says. Not by choice, just one random song from my 64GB SD card with mp3's. Maybe had heard it just once before. 

I start thinking of my parents; how their upbringing influenced who I have become, and similar thoughts. Then I get this idea that we are all prisoners in our own bodies, that to die is to become free, free from all pain and the limitations of our sensory apparatus. Like someone once said, dying is like taking off a bad fitting shoe. I feel a longing to go there (the other side), to be with my lost relatives, to be with the all loving force. I feel loved by this force for who I am, with all my faults.

I see death as a jubilant occasion to celebrate! I cry very deeply and cleansing. Not out of just sadness or of joy, maybe out of this feeling of love – or a mixture of all those feelings.

Normally I'm some sort of half agnostic, half Buddhist, half Taoist kind of person. (I know the math doesn't add up ;^).) It all feels very natural, true and fantastic! A very deep and rewarding experience! Not an ego death, but definitely left me with a bit of reduced ego.

Fast forward half a year. Prelude to today's trip:

I've been planing to visit my dying mother and my daughter have been really teenage sullen regarding that trip. After a lot of pushing and cajoling she comes out and says that she's anxious meeting grandma and that she thinks a lot about death. Great that she got that out!

I take my AL-LAD tab and goes for a long forest walk. Beautiful day, can't stop smiling! That I had slight anxiety - as always - before dropping seems ridiculous now. Walking home I start imagining having a conversation with my daughter about death. That we're all (in the words of Joseph Campbell) like light bulbs, and we all will break down and stop shining one day. But if we don't identify with the bulb, but with the light (& the electricity), we will go on forever - as energy never can be destructed. Coming closer to home I realize that the metaphor may be a bit difficult for her to comprehend... Want to tell her that she is everything & that everything is she... No, that won't work either… ;^)

Now listening to - also by random - Philip Glass, Glassworks, Opening. Somehow similar to Says by Nils Frahm. Both so beautiful! Returning home, I'll be alone for a couple of hours. I’m going back in my memories to the feeling from the AL-LAD trip 5 month ago. Feeling this longing to become one with the source; to be drinking from that infinite well of love, to not be - to be everything. Thinking of some of my hard times, my unsuccessful attempts as a child to help my emotionally crippled parents. I do some deep, deep crying. After a not brief time, I suddenly feel deep, nonjudgmental, love for myself. Feeling so much gratefulness and love to those who made these molecules for the first time and especially to those who - undoubtedly with much intelligence, dedication, love and courage - made them available to me and others. 

All this is written at the tail end of the second trip - so will probably embarrass me in a day or two... :^) and it may all be psychotic ramblings.

But AL-LAD can definitely be deep - and not very visual - at 150 mcg. At least for me these 2 times. Definitely one of my top 5 psychedelics! 

I share my stories for others to learn from, as I've learned a lot from others stories.

May the force be with you! ![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif)

Thanks for sharing!  If you'd like you could post it in our Trip Reports forum too and add it to the database of experiences we have there. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


AL-LAD can be highly visual in a very unique way, quite different from LSD, at somewhat higher dosages.  I have generally found it to be a very visual substance, also generally very euphoric and giggly.  It can also really make things confusing including talking.

Thank you for your reply! (& your many post over the years!) Added to the trip reports. Investigating 225 mcg now, and letters are swirling more on my keypad now than on 150 mcg, but just 90 min in. Warmth from my fireplace is magic as is music!

Probably acetonitrile. That's what the main lysergamide source chose to use when they sold dropper bottles of 1P-LSD.

Sounds a bit toxic and nasty. I know it's all in the dosage, but why acetonitrile instead of say ethanol?

I love AL-LAD. One of my all time faves. It really shines when you go up to like 600ug, or less if you're not up to it. Some of the most amazing visuals ever, and, despite what some  saying it has no headspace? You will change your mind if you go high enough dosage-wise. It's pretty nutty.

How are the side or body effects? Is it as heat generating as ETH-LAD? I would eat more LAD, at higher doses, but had a scary heat-out on it last year.

From my understanding ETH-LAD is a bit more powerful visually and for some can come with a bodyload "stomach unease". But i heard the visuals are outstanding and that side effect doesn't hqppen to everyone. I'm sitting on two 100ug blotters of ETH-LAD right now.


Was planning on trying half one and seeing where it takes me, figure that should lessen any physical distractions if they were to arise. Back when I sampled AL-LAD I found it to be quite inferior to LSD-25 but that is just my personal opinion. I got this strange headache from it. And the visuals weren't as lush and fluid as im used too.


I mean the Alladin brought me on a mental journey and the visuals we're heavily present both CEV and OEV. But this nagging congestion and headache I had was terrible. Also later found out I wasnt on the right blood pressure pill anymore. So who knows maybe in a different scenario id love the stuff.


Always found Acid smooth though, and would honestly always choose it first.


But ETH-LAD may change my mind  ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I found ETH-LAD to be highly visual, slightly differently than lsd is. For one, it’s (for me, at least) consitantly full of golds, oranges and reds, and high tech outlines on evrything. I’ve done lsd countless times since the late 80s, but this compound is noticeably different. And has two kind of plateaus usually. But for me, when I have tried to mix in a bit of my daily cannabis, it is a straight trip to temperature flux and sometimes serious nausea. On its own though, it is my favourite lysergamide. 


50 mics is so sweet and enhancing, gentle and fun. Just watch the mixing of other stuff until you know this cousin. I have a TR in here about a staggered 2x25 mic trip which was juicy. 

100 mics and I’m in full floor melt.


I am ordering a 5 strip of AL tomorrow and will try next week and post a TR. Two weeks later, it’s ALD-52!!!

Seriously have some on hand in case it disappears for a while — it is worthy of research.

ETH-lad is like lsd ramped up ten fold its on another level to other psychedelics. It is one hell of a crazy mind fuck with insane visuals that will take you very far out there.  I did 330 ug in 2016 and that trip showed me the impossible enity contact in hyper space 9th dimesional space existing. Mutiple thought streams it felt like i existed in 4 different places across time and space so much of the trip i can not put into words but take enough of it and i swear it is as strong as dmt. I was also very stoned on cannabis when i took it.

ALD-52 and LSD are indistinguishable. I find ALD-52 much more fun than AL-LAD due to the LSD like mental effect. Otherwise, AL-LAD is just a much more mild (mentally) and slightly different (visually) drug. I find that I can take 750ug AL-LAD and not have too strong of a trip, in fact, I don't dose less than 750ug. With ALD-52, 300-400ug is enough to have the most transcendental of trips.


YMMV, as others seem more sensitive to Aladdin. I find it a wastefully expensive drug, as a 25 blotter sheet is only 5 doses for me lol.


Never taken ETH though. It seems to be the harshest of the three from reading anecdotal reports.

If you try to tell me that all DOC is blue, and that AL-LAD and ETH-LAD have a taste, then it doesn't matter who you are, I, as an experienced drug user myself with all of the compounds mentioned, am going to give my own experience otherwise.  This isn't the "heatlessbbq is the supreme master of all psychedelic knowledge and to disagree with him means he's being silenced and also that you're wrong" forum.  You've been disseminating a variety of patently false information, and people are calling you on it.  This is a public forum, I don't care if you tell me I'm wrong according to your knowledge if you think I'm wrong, but we expect respectful discourse here.  Getting aggressive and insulting when someone disagrees with you is unacceptable in PD/Bluelight in general.  And if you post something, you need to be open to people debating with you on the validity of your information.  This is a harm reduction and drug information forum.  The community feels pretty strongly about us being the best source of information out there, so if we see people spouting false information, we're going to call it out.


Further aggression will result in disciplinary action.  We haven't had to infract anyone in PD in years.  Hopefully that tells you something about the way you've been acting.


Now let's get back to AL-LAD, shall we?

I took 600 mics last night crazy trip most insane visuals and mindfuck it was awesome. Hopefully I an not frying my brain on some crazy RC strongest visuals i have ever had though. I have a a few of these stashed I hope the powers that be brew up more some day, hard to Start a AL LAD religion with 75 hits. for me AL LAD is all about the large dosages the i can't even feel 150 mics but the big trips are next level it wasn't even recreational, in fact next will i take less. It seems to really pop in a way 1 p or acid or ald 52 dont anymore. I always thought of it as a mellow sort acid light at low doses, kind of boring really, its somewhere around 350 mics where you realize its a full psychedelic that kick your ass with  the best of them

AL-LAD felt like a Lysergic, not like an Phenethylamine nor a Tryptamine. Totally different class ime.

LSD and all Lisergamides have the Tryptamine backbone in them, I will admit I am not sure if that makes them also Tryptamines or not, but that's what I meant. Somebody correct me if I am wrong plz, now I am curious.


Regarding AL LAD and aMT, saying phenethylaminesque I meant they feel to me closer in effects to Phenethylamine psychedelics compared to DMT, Mushrooms, 4-Aco-DMT, LSD etc.

"Feel to me" is the key part here ofcourse I am talking about my subjective feel and I cannot know how another person exactly feels.

For me they feel more clear headed and stimulant, like Phenethylamines are.

I would think that it is the Dopamine agonist and relatively stronger 5HT2A affinity properties of AL LAD and the NSDRA+NSDRI properties of aMT that make me fell that way, can't be sure ofcourse.

The chemical and pharmacological relation is not what my reply was about it was purely how I experience em' myself.


My limited experience with the three are limited to 2-cb. 2-ct-2 and 2-cc. aMT, 5-meo-DIPT and Psilo's. The Lysergic's I got covered best imo.


But responses to psychedelic's vary that much that any relation a person has with them is as accurate as can be.


I totally feel you but myself I react so typical to the three different classes I could narrow it to this:


My Tryptamines have a good headspace but bodily they suck. 5-meo-DIPT was the closest to a Lysergic.


The 2-c's have a 'reasonably' endurable bodyload, but they miss the best of the introspective part. 2-ct-2 was pretty close to a trip on something acid like. But not quite there. Very warm and nice though! Closest I'll get to Mescaline in pure form probably ever. A cactus extraction is something I can see happening btw. But 2-cc had quite a heavy load for an easy going material!


The lysergic's, LSD/ ALD/ AL-LAD get me there. Not as far I would have wanted to, but I decided to wait a while before any further experiment's. Don't know about the 1P-LSD as it seems to give an off experience 2 times in a rope. It would be easy to say it is a bad batch or different chemical. But it misses the 2c's miss in headspace and bodyload of the Tryptamine's I tried.  So it technically behaves as the others within' the fam. The last time I took true 'cid was more then 20 year's ago. But probably I like em all incl. Eth-LAD, LSZ, the 1p variation's.

Mh, funny thing I don't ever get bodyloads... from anything except what it feels low quality LSD (as in, all effects of LSD are present but for some reason I feel nauseous plus something that is similar on some level to some symptom of illness.... hard to explain but it is also sedating), and even then it's not that bad. So for me these three families are different only in their desired effects.

Tripped on 150ug AL-LAD a couple of days ago. This time it was not that visual at all (like it usually is). It was a much more mental Trip with a nice clarity to think about things in life. When I layed down to listen to some music with headphones I switched through my playlist till I came to one track that just sucked me up. It was the [Stalag 17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qks3iZWKS78) Riddim by the Techniques All Stars that got me. There was a very feminine vibe to it and I got closed eyes visions of beautiful women with an absolutely phenomenal euphoria. Fantastic material. Glad I stocked up

Hey there Morphing Willie, welcome to Bluelight/PD. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  Yeah I love AL-LAD... I stocked up too, I still have some but I wish I had gotten more.  I also got a bunch of ETH-LAD and I've only taken that a couple of times.  AL-LAD definitely has a magic and whimsy to it, and is more outright euphoric than LSD too.  Very recreational.  I took 450ug my first time and at the time I was extremely insensitive to lysergamides, and I had a really nice trip and was quite intoxicated... I could see how taking a stronger dose than that could produce a pretty profound state.  I should probably try it before I run out.

Having in mind that they dont produce it anytime soon, stocking up seemed clever to me. Allthough all that lysergs and trypts are now forbidden in my country, so there are all a rare thing now. 450ug seems like a big journey to me. Meanwhile I feel ready to up my dose a little and see what AL-LAD can really do to me. The sweet autumn is ahead and that calls for a really nice hike in nature with pretty leaf and lysergig colours ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I don't know if it is the same for everyone, but AL LAD gets me very hot, significantly more so than LSD.

I am generally prone to heating up easy and quick when sober with moderate physical activity, with AL LAD I didn't even need the activity.

Going over 450ug I would make sure I have a way of checking my temp and a way of lowering it.

In my beginning AL-LAD trails I had that overheating sensation too, but since I changed my diet to a more healthy and vegetable oriented way, these symptom never rised again. Though there is sometimes a "cold" feeling during the experience, which does not bother me at all.

Never got to try this one. So I hope so

In fact hearing it was gone and likely not coming back encouraged me to jump on the lysergamide wagon before I missed out... 

Like with amt, dox and others

AL-LAD coming back would be awesome. 


So earlier in this thread there were people complaining of weird side effects, and on reddit there was a bunch of speculation on a "bad batch" here and other places:


Normally I would write this stuff as paranoid hysteria as all my AL-LAD experiences have been fantastic. But I did see a report from energy control:


![www.ecstasydata.org](https://www.bluelight.org/community/proxy.php?image=https%3A%2F%2Fecstasydata.org%2Fimages%2Fdisplay%2F6377.jpg&hash=870937394d67be72edc9d134977989b3&return_error=1)


##### DrugsData.org (was EcstasyData): Test Details : Result #6377 - AL-LAD, 6377

DrugsData (EcstasyData) lab testing result


![www.ecstasydata.org](https://www.bluelight.org/community/proxy.php?image=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ecstasydata.org%2Fimages%2Flayout%2Ffavicon.ico&hash=7f20a3ce50a9fa37a5424ab212bf1f41&return_error=1)

					www.ecstasydata.org
				


Its the picture of the standard blotter with name on it but the results state:


- [5-fluoro-ADB](https://www.ecstasydata.org/search.php?substance1=2220): 1
- [AL-LAD](https://www.ecstasydata.org/search.php?substance1=2138) : 1
- [3-Fluorophenmetrazine](https://www.ecstasydata.org/search.php?substance1=2281) : trace
- [4-Methylmethcathinone](https://www.ecstasydata.org/search.php?substance1=2043) : trace
- [ALD-52](https://www.ecstasydata.org/search.php?substance1=2329) : trace
So people on Reddit took this to mean people's bad reactions were because a sketchy synth noid was added. I find that hard to believe. This had to have been added after market. Or an accidental cross contamination. I still have some, and access to GCMS. Anyone think its worthwhile to test?

Considering the trace amounts of other drugs on the blotter and the fact that the one drug that is 1/1 probably isn't active in mcg range, I'd say the chances of any AL-LAD blotters being intentionally contaminated are slim to none, and it likely occurred as an effect of these chemical suppliers not having enough cleanliness when laying blotter.

Yeah I think it's worthwhile to test for sure, I'm pretty skeptical that there is wacky contamination like this happening from the original source.

Is this one making a comeback? I’ve taken al-lad almost every month(microdosed weekly) since it was first available years ago because, to me, the anti-depressant properties are unmatched by any other lysergamide. I started off with a few hundred blotters, and 100mg/ethanol solution, and was hoping that’d last me a lifetime. seven years later, and I’m pretty damn low lol. I started using it quicker when I realized it potentiates 1P & 1B, but it is what it is. I’m not sure why, but this one fits my receptors to the t...


Also, wasup y’all first post back in a long time! Feels good mang!!

I wish, I'm just finishing some that I mixed with 1p in distilled water for micro-dosing. 

50 mics of that is left.

nothing is the same as AlLad.

1cp is very sweet but AlLad was the ultimate tweety bird in the lysergic series.

Had some of the most magical, spectacularly visual yet easy to handle trips of my life with early batches of this stuff. Been years since I took it, def my fave RC lyserg.

Yeah AL-LAD was one of the best drugs ever invented. Super friendly and visual, little to no downside. If psychedelics ever become legal this one is definitely gonna make a comeback. Until then...

No its back, you can order 10 thousand hits if you want, I just tested the cart. And they didn't have any last week. There were a reseller or two who maybe had some, but the producers themselves are selling it now, its a new batch as of this past week, you can search reddit for more info. Its 150 mics a hit again. Anyway I thought heard they had problems making it and were looking for a new route or something, maybe this batch was crazy expensive to produce.  I can't remember if this is the site with no price discussion.  The price if it doesn't at least halve I'm not buying any. There is speculation they just pegged the price at what last reseller had it listed for. Its back though

like another poster said AL LAD is back but at insane prices due to being "a rare product" as many vendors seemed to have copied and pasted. I think my next lysergamide purchase will be 1cP LSD as my vendor offers it a bit cheaper than 1P and ive heard nothing but good things on 1cP..... Also I think I may continue to order 4 PrO DMT over 4 AcO DMT as again my vendor offers it cheaper and I find the effect and potency of 4 PrO to be on par with 4 AcO

Yes it is officially back alright, available now from the Dutch direct partners,  just at an understandable and expected premium.


I think they raised cost simply because the production costs vs yield were too high before.


They also have ETH LAD, so only ALD is absent now.


Also cheaper suddenly for the rest, like 440 EUR for 250 1cP blotters, vs 500 EUR previously.

Thinking about grabbing a few tabs of Aladdin. It's been a while but from what I remember Al-lad and eth-lad were far superior to 1p-lsd. Al-lad provided one of the most easygoing psychedelic experiences I've ever had.

Yeah it's back but it's absurdly expensive. I ordered 5 blots for one last ride.  Your right 1p felt a little harsh and edgy to me so I'm avoiding that one. I also have 5-mapb coming Along  as well but I have yet to try it. considering its profile alone it appears like it would make a lovely addition to a tab or two of al-lad.

I have had such strange luck with underdoped blotters, such that with the same degree of tolerance, what should be 20ug of 1plsd is stronger than 100ug of 1cplsd, than 100ug of al-lad, and 80 mics of ald52, and 30 mics of ethlad.


these may all just be lsd prodrugs with suppliers achieving a kind of bouquet of offerings just by being inconsistent in how they lay tabs.


I have to admit my first shipment of 1cp was way way better/stonger than the second.


aside from potency are they qualitatively different? maybe. here is my scale of assessment based upon visual changes

but they may just reflect back on effective dosage on the tabs.

im sure a few of us got the news letter from the official producer of AL LAD today....it seems its making a full return at 150 mic blotters, but they are recommending retailers sell it as a  high end connoisseur  product and suggest a retail price twice that of 1P LSD. as Novel as it is, I just cant justify that when I can get 1000 mg's of 4 PrO DMT for the same price it would probably cost for 10 AL LAD blotters. Id rather have 40 x 25 mg doses of a psilocin analog if it costs me the same as 10 x 150 mics of AL LAD which i never found as a stand out Lysergamide like ETH LAD for example. that I would perhaps pay a premium for since it is somewhat rare and stronger by weight rather then weaker than LSD. I find 300 mics of AL LAD still isnt as strong as 100 mics of ETH LAD. i find 300 mics of AL LAD feels like 150 mics of 1P LSD to me

I've taken AL-LAD about .. 6 times, most times just a single 150ug blotter. I've absolutely loved it every single time. It's always fairly mild, silly and pleasant, except one time we hit a hot spot on the sheet and it was absolutely bonkers strong (in a good way!) with a single tab. That was a different beast altogether.


Personally, I think it *is* a stand out psychedelic, but it's a shame it's getting the boutique price treatment. It's actually still worth the price IMO, but there are so many other worthwhile psychedelics as [@OntarioGuy](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/118346/) points out that are priced more reasonably. I'd also agree that ETH-LAD is a stand out psychedelic. It's funny that AL-LAD got way more attention than ETH-LAD. I guess ETH-LAD is so heavy-duty that it didn't catch on as much?

I think ETH LADs  potency did in fact turn people off. especially since it was laid at like 150 mics on its initial release. I think AL LAD has potential. obviously if I took 1000 mics im sure Id have a full on ++++ acid trip, but if its going to cost me the same for that one experience that it would cost to get the same experience 20 times from a gram of a 4 sub tryptamine, its just not worth it to me personally.


My first time with ETH LAD I took 400 micrograms and it kicked my ass. I had been taking DW LSD 25 tabs advertised at 110 mics per blotter, and 6 of those would give me an insane trip, though i could handle it. so i figured 400 mg of ETH LAD would be manageable. It was, but the visuals were insane, the death of the ego profound, and the closed eyed visuals totally immersive. in retrospect I think the DW tabs I was getting were likely around maybe 70 micrograms if i had to make a guess by comparing it to the potency of the 100 mg 1P blotters etc.

Yes ^ and eth-lad has that extra something for about half of users reporting serious nausea and temperature effects.

If I mix it with another, I’m in that camp; by itself, I have a smooth trip.

It just hits so fast and so visual!

Bought a ten strip from the source.


Three others and I took them during a walk in a national park over the weekend. We all took 150ug. Everyone had a very mild experience, faint visuals - essentially no altered mindspace, they just felt a light high. Whereas I, instead, had an extremely intense experience. The visuals were so overwhelming I could barely see. I started slipping into a loss of ego, which was extremely inappropriate considering that the park was much more populated than expected. It was essential that I "looked" sober to strangers. 


Also - the duration, for me alone, was longer than 8 hours. I was mentally sober by hour 9, but still have OEVs at hour 12 - needed to take a benzo to sleep.


While it definitely had a less sinister vibe, the alteration in experience was quite similar to 150ug-200ug LSD. This was everyone in my groups 1st-5th experience, where I've probably had close to 25-40 trips.


Still trying to piece together what happened. Is it possible that they were laid inconsistently? Or that my increased experience with psychs made me fall into the experience more fully?


I took some l-citrulline, ginger and magnesium before - if that could possibly make any difference.

this is the most frustrating thing about a perfect drug taking method!

it is manufactured imperfectly, so while we may want to believe it is 100 mics per tab, it will vary from 25 mics to 200 per tab.


damn!

Yes, there be hotspots out there in the AL-LAD [@AnanasBannana](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/390757/)! Seems my companions and I hit 4 hotspots in a row last summer; they all came off the same edge of the sheet. I think I bought the batch around 2014. It was so much stronger than any other try with AL-LAD, which up until then I thought was just a mild lysergamide. Inconsistently laid tabs is the most likely explanation.


Man, AL-LAD gets bonkers on higher doses! The dose was so different from previous ones that I'm tempted to put some of my remaining tabs into solution so that it's more predictable. I really liked it at the high dose mind you, so it was a pleasant but overwhelming surprise.

Three of us tried the newest batch of Al-Lad. Lots of previous experience with Al_Lad (10+ trips maximum dose 450ug) and other psychs.


All of us took 1.5 tabs 225ug - usual tabs with chemical on them. 


If felt at least double the strength of the 450ug trip (one had a bad trip 4 hours in and had to be talked down for a hour). Huge amount of visuals (more than on Aya or all LSD experiences), confusing headspace, massive euphoria, couple of hours of cronic laughing and humour.


At the end of the experience we all agreed that the dose was too way much. Not sure if they are badly laid (they were from the edge of a sheet) or if the new synth is somehow stronger.


Either way, beware if you have the new batch - they may be unusually strong. Having done lots before I was sure it would be the usual easy to handle substance I have used in the past - not so.

Yes I went fully psychotic, it was indeed unusually strong, equally strong as like 500ug of LSD (2 blotters).

It came up very fast and soon I had completely lost it, never had it before on any psychedelic.

[@Morphing Willie](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/525288/) - Not really a negative bodyload, it was uncomfortable at times and hot but mainly euphoric and intense. If I had bene on my own (I was the host), I would have closed my eyes and listened to music and just gone down the rabbit hole.


All of us are middle aged and pretty experienced. The guy who had a bad trip went fully psychotic like [@Buzz Lightbeer](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/509667/). He's a huge guy (body builder) and he collapsed and was muttering gibberish, we managed to get him outside on the grass. I had to keep restraining him and telling him who we were. Took about an hour or two till he was lucid enough to talk to us coherently.


He said he thought we were paramedics in Brazil and that he had died, he kept looping in and out. Kept tensing all the time and nearly bit me twice. Fortunately no one was hurt.

Wow that's nuts [@somethingfun](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/543026/). I've had a similar experience with an old batch, which I've mentioned ad nauseam in this thread and elsewhere. Makes me seriously consider dissolving batches of tabs in solvent and then titrating and volumetrically dosing this stuff, to get consistent reliable dosing. I also slightly wonder if there is just weird x-factor stuff going on with al-lad too, maybe something metabolic, or just freaking vibes and auto suggestion. The metabolic thing doesn't makes sense because your whole party was affected intensely, as was mine. The "vibes" thing doesn't really make sense either, it's so hard for me to believe that the mind fuckery we, you, and buzz lightbeer experienced was just "in our heads" (lol what else could it be?). So that brings it back to the dosing.

I think it's hotspots. When the old batch was circulating I never dosed less than '750ug' the last few trips because up to '450ug' didn't really do anything. Either I have to push the dose with it ('750ug' was the full blown 'trip' like any 5 hits of acid woulda done) or there's some extremely bad hot-spotting going on, to this day.

I wonder if there could be something about the molecule itself, or the form it's in, that makes it more prone to forming hotspots? The manufacturers by now have ample experience laying blotter, and you don't hear about this so much with 1P-LSD for example.

I've never really spoke about it but my one trial with AL-LAD went pretty badly when it first hit the scene years ago. Probably should have spoke about it at the time but everyone else was having consistently good trips it seemed so infigured something was off with me that day. I'd taken one 150ug blotter and it was surprisingly visual but during the peak I got really bad anxiety and a headache it just wasn't pleasant experience for me. And at the time I had alot of 4-subs/2C-x/DOC so I just went back to taking those. A few months later I got some LSD-25 and trips went smooth so I always just figured something was off with me that day. I'd ended up giving the rest of it away to a friend and they let the stuff degrade until I have it to yet another person, the batch got wasted pretty badly in retrospect inthink they were nervous cuz intold them it didn't agree with me and I was the guy they went to for advice about these things. This was from the batch that was released with LSZ.

Yeah, something seems odd here. If the last batch was correctly dosed, then it seems quite strange that several very experienced trippers were losing it on modest doses. Using the prior batch as my point of reference, it's hard to imagine very many people having trouble with AL-LAD even at high doses, and I'm a bit of a lightweight. It just seemed easy going even on higher doses to the point of being kinda boring. My guess is really bad hot spots, too, but who can say for sure?

Bout to take the plunge with this substance on Saturday. Should 225 mics provide a solid experience? I’ve heard this compound has a shorter duration. If so, how long does it usually take to arrive at the peak?

Yes, 225 should be strong enough for an introduction to the compound. If I remember correctly, it takes about an hour to reach the peak, then by the sixth hour you'll be already starting to come-down. Residual effects last for a maybe three or four hours more. I already had good effect from 150 µg, but there's many people that find that dosage worthless. At 225 it was strong for me. I seem to be an outlier, or maybe the real explanation is the uneven laying of the blotters that others commented here (maybe I got hotspotted tabs), but regardless, if you choose to take 225 µg be open to the possibility that it may range from a mild to a strong experience depending on how you respond to it.

She was off of it for quite some time but unbeknownst to me she started began taking it again a week or so ago. In my experience the only problems with ssris and psychs is that they reduce the intensity of the experience.


I really enjoyed al-lad. I was very nervous about tripping as it had been 5-6 years since I’ve dabbled with psychs and I was a little depressed as well. It had such a clean head space with pleasant visuals and minimal body load. Surprisingly I also experienced tactile and auditory hallucinations which I usually don’t get on psychs. A smooth glass orb felt like a dodecahedron and my girls voices had this reverb echoey static effect. It was pretty remarkable. I’ll  definitely try 450 mic next time. Has anyone combined Dissociatives with this beauty? I’m thinking of using 20mg of dmxe after the peak begins to taper off.

Personally I have seen no uneven sheets of AL-LAD I bought it a few different times and have a few different quarter sheets. It seems like it takes longer for my tolerance to reset after doing it. I always wait a month between trips but with AL-LAD I wait even longer. So if you had a cracking good time on it, waited two weeks and it didn't work I would gravitate toward you just didn't wait long enough before the uneven blotters angle. 

Also Buzz freaking isn't abnormal, no one is 100 percent able to say "it could never happen to me. " I took 600 mics and my behavior was almost certainly strange enough to warrant a trip to a padded room, but I live alone so no one to report me. It's a powerful drug and the difference between I can barely feel it and it's way too much is only like 75 mics. I haven't tried the new batch I still have lots of the old ones, which remain potent years later I did it about a month ago. Still my favorite drug

Yes, no amount of experience can prevent it, something just snaps, different than a panic attack or so.

After about hour 3 I came somewhat to my senses but I was already restrained by police.

Found this very active at 150ug but 300ug+ is when it really began to shine.


It felt clearer headed for me compared to LSD and very positive. Also felt that the experience could go as negative as any LSD trip depending on the individual and dose.

I don’t know what the issue is but I don’t respond to psychs like I used to. At 425 mics I expected it to be more visual, but all I got was some faint greenish and purplish lines that formed vague little patterns. I used to get crazy defined geometric fractals composed of various bright colors, but now I feel like I can’t get there anymore. I seem to be more prone to confusion as well. I went to this bar in Hawaii while peaking and it was pretty bad. The disorientation was so severe that I forgot how to use my phone. Not sure if it’s because I’m older or my drug addled brain.

Trips have been more hit or miss for me as I age. Some are almost like the old days, some just produce nasty physical sides.

I know my organs are older and probably weaker, my brain too, and things like diet and exercise have a more marked effect on my trips than those factors did in my past.

All I know is, when my body is feeling good and I have been eating well, trips can get fractal. But 425 ug would have me floored no matter what.

On any meds at all, maybe interacting/dulling the trip?

At 425 mics I expected it to be more visual, but all I got was some faint greenish and purplish lines that formed vague little patterns. I used to get crazy defined geometric fractals composed of various bright colors, but now I feel like I can’t get there anymore. I seem to be more prone to confusion as well. I went to this bar in Hawaii while peaking and it was pretty bad. The disorientation was so severe that I forgot how to use my phone. Not sure if it’s because I’m older or my drug addled brain.

Set and setting among many other variables.


I've eaten at least a few 100 mics before and not had an ego death on LSD. Other times I've eaten less than 200 mics and been scared to lie down for fear of one...Same blotters too.


Anyone had or witnessed a bad trip on AL-LAD?

Witnessed the exact same experience. Person was uncontrollable. Never been good on psychedelics since. Have you tripped again since?

I usually don’t experience much confusion on al-lad but yeah probably not the best choice while peaking. I was fine walking in there but we couldn’t get a spot outside so they placed us right in the busiest section at the bar. The sounds were coming from every direction and I became so disoriented I couldn’t even figure my phone out.

It seems every trip I’ve had over the last few years have been pretty disappointing. I experience more of the negative side effects (body load, confusion, dysphoria) and don’t have those amazing insightful experiences accompanied by captivating visuals that leave you astounded. I’m not on any meds that dull the experience so perhaps my overall physiology has changed. I remembered al-lad to be one of the more visual psychs and I thought 400 plus mics should suffice to get me there but I never seem to arrive. Bummer.

I did a combo with 375 mics of AL-LAD and 200 mics of ALD 52 the other day and was impressed. My last 3 hit AL-LAD trip was underwhelming. Things I did different this time: quit drinking for a few months, didn't eat before the trip and was extremely well rested. I also stopped doing DMT all the time, I know its not supposed to matter but my last few trips were lacking. This trip had everything, visuals, headspace, euphoria. I guess it was 575 mics total too, which is a lot.

I’m going to take some al-lad tomorrow with some E pills. When should I drop the mdma? I’m thinking an hour or so after I take the al-lad. I also have ketamine. Shits about to get weird.

Sounds good to me - if you stay below 225 mcg, if higher, I'd take it at maybe 3 h.

[@higherconciousness](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/178700/) I agree with [@PsychedelicSummer](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/469523/) - except I'd probably more like 1-2h if it was below 225ug - some of the tabs are hot and you'll be dosing a lot higher that you think, so you might want to make sure this wasn't the case before you throw MDMA on top. 


My friends and I had plans to do an AL-flip, and ended up not taking the MDMA when we discovered we were in absolute bonkers land from 1 "150ug" tab each. The idea of putting MDMA on top seemed completely mad.

I didn’t take al-lad with mdma last night I just ended up taking mdma (200mg), but I noticed that even mdma doesn’t effect me like it used to. Don’t get me wrong it still produced some pleasant effects, but it’s not what it used to be. I really think my overall brain physiology had changed. I was heavy addict, taking everything under the sun, since I was 15 years old. I’m now 30 with 4 years of being clean and whether I take al-lad or mdma I still can’t reach the state of bliss. The last 4 al-lad trips, anywhere from 300-450 mics, where extremely underwhelming. All I got was subpar visuals (purply greenish lines in my field of vision). Ugh what the hell is happening?

I did 0.3 mg yesterday and I fell into the infinity when I was peaking. Is it something that happens every time on such high doses? I was having a great time and then suddenly - BOOM. I'm stuck at someplace that keeps changing but eventually always comes back to a certain visual (that's how I perceived it). And every song I was listening to felt like it matched that loop perfectly. I know it was only an illusion, but man... It wasn't pleasant. And seems to me like it was caused by changes in my brain's mechanism of registering memories - like something happening 5 seconds ago was registered as something that happened 2 hours ago. So I guess such loops are something that is very likely to happen no matter how good or bad the trip is?

[@aag](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/547833/) [@Buzz Lightbeer](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/509667/) had an intense trip from a high dose not long ago.. 

As did [@higherconciousness](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/178700/) 


Just scroll up. 

Tbh Ive never tried it but Im not surprised. It is a lysergamide after all. Id be disappointed if it didnt get fuckity at higher doses lol

If only it werent rare and so expensive these days.

Just wanted to report that I tripped with my tripping partner on 300ug each of al-lad which was several years old and the tabs have turned dark grey but we both tripped pretty well so I don't believe they have degraded much....though next time I'd go with 450ug.

My ETH-LAD has also tuned slightly gray but not nearly as much.....these were all kept in an extremely cold cold storage facility in air tight containers with dessicants so I don't think they'll last 10 years or more ....my 1p-lsd and ald-52 look just like day I got em in the mail.

I took AL Lad twice. 300 ug 1st, was already on other Lysergamides but I noticed it fully for its unique, light sparky colourful character.


The tabs had yellowed significantly. No noticeable loss.


These things really are so damn stable for a long time really. Much more than is even still often regarded.

After the news that ETH-LAD is a full-agonist (vs. LSD being a partial agonist) on the 5ht2a serotonin receptor, I suspect that AL-LAD is also a stronger agonist than LSD on 5ht2a. AL-LAD must have lower binding affinity, but higher agonism. This would explain why AL-LAD has a higher effective dose than LSD, yet seems to get more into bonkers-land as the dosage goes up. When you ramp up the dosage of LSD, it saturates more readily, whereas ETH-LAD and AL-LAD seem to lack this ceiling, and have the potential to become more powerful as the dosage scales up.

How’s the redosing timeline with this one folks? I am a little leery of just munching the whole tab I have pulled off the strip. Can I dose half then the other half in ~2 hours to judge potency? My trip sitter is just my tiny wife and don’t want to go psychotic or anything from a hotspot

If within an hour, could be a bit of a synergy with the addition, but the longer you wait, you are just bumping up tolerance with no appreciable bumping of the experience. I would not worry a ton about things going too sideways with AL at that type of dose, at least in my experience. But of course, your mileage may vary.

I also think you'd want to redose about within the hour, like ^ said. I think by an hour in you can kind of tell the trajectory you're on. Half an hour in, it won't be obvious yet. 2h in you're probably just prolonging the experience.

Just on the tail end of a very nice experience with this one. A friend came to visit from another city since mountain biking was out for 0the day due to 100 + mm of rain. So we skipped the biking part and hit a dry sauna for a good hour leading up to the experience. I made sure no microdoses the week leading up to this.


Anyway, we dropped 150 MCG AL-LAD each at about 8:45 pm, and proceeded to make personal pizzas and salad. We bought a game which I thought was going to be much more cognitively rewarding than it turned out to be (marble blast), and it's alright. probz gonna return that if I can haha. My buddy shows off his sick knife skills as I just observe how many times I would have cut my own fingers trying to do something similar while cutting onions. It was generally pretty fun, first alerts were in 20 mins which was very unexpected.


Once the peak had been reached (about 3 - 4 hrs in) objects breathing and lucid thoughts flow easily. We got pretty into some other drugs to accentuate the AL_LAD, mainly being hitting a DMT vape pen and later bringing in some very nice DMT crystal. We also started bumping MDMA around 1 - 4 AM, so every sensation I may have been able to derive from the AL_LAD experience is heavily tainted.


However, before any adulteration outside of just the AL-LAD experiment it's self, I noticed a few things;


The quick come up was smooth and didn't cause any pre flight anxiety

The type of visual distortions were mostly pattern recognition and breathing of objects around us

Not too deep or immersive of a head space


Synergizes well with DMT


After adding about 170 mg of pure MDMA, the crystal DMT seems to be losing it's magic, so we decide we're probz done trying to blast off for the evening haha.


All in all, worth while experience. I'd do a full hit in public under the right circumstances

I absolutely hate uk laws and the fact we aint even in the eu makes living there hard. Al lad is something i would take often because of its light nature at doses of 100 mics or so and lack of side effects.

Next time you'll know and can take a whole blotter. This will avoid paranoia, and low dosed LSD analogue's are nice to. Like in the inevitable case you ingest half your required dose.

Why? But ALD-52 totally dissapeared of the regular map. 


But as far as Lysergic's go ALD is the absolute king. Al-Lad is good, because its difference. 1p-LSD is like i remember LSD to be. So they all deserve a place, ALD is just on the top.

I decided instead of cashing out my crypto profits a few years ago that i would just buy ALD 52 so I have enough to last quite a few years. I just like the combo better than either drug alone. AL-LAD alone is very visual but kind of cold, ALD brings pure joy to the equation

I don't think I could distinguish ALD-52 from 1cP-LSD in a blind test. Still, I reach for my ALD-52 and not my 1cP-LSD when in the the mood.

I can't speak for those exact 2, but I know 1cP-LSD VS 1P-LSD, the 1cP takes like 2 hrs to fully kick for me.


AL-LAD hit pretty fast, within about 35 mins I was high which I hadn't been used to since 1p and ALD-52 seem to take about an hr for me. That propanol moiety really slows down the come up. Other than the slow come on, I couldn't tell much of a difference. AL-LAD is up there with my favorites for sure ![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif)

To me ALD-52 is distinguisable from 1p-LSD. Both are good Lysergics but my preference is highly towards ALD.

Well i can create a experience if they sent me the right stuff this time. Last time i got AL-LAD instead. Which I also think is a great .


But as 1cP-AL-LAD is easy available i am willing to invest in some, for some future trips. Might take a while before i take em though.

My vendor probably wants to get sell off his expensive AL-LAD stash, which I emailed them and asked them to stock when AL-LAD came back, before they carry 1cp-al-lad which is way cheaper. I'm curious to try the 1cp-AL-LAD, 1cp-LSD is awesome. If its just like AL-LAD, I would stock up. The AL-LAD I bought in 2017 is as potent as it was when I bought it. This stuff should last damn near forever. I don't like LSZ much and don't like ETH-LAD at all but AL-LAD is fantastic and has some of the best visuals of any drug

Probably you know but there is a bill in the U.S. congress to decriminalize possession

of all so-called narcotics at the federal level. Its a start anyway. Yeah, legal LSD, AL-LAD

that makes more sense if pot, alcohol, firearms, and tobacco are legal as they should be.

And yes, legalization is the next step after de-criminalization, they are not the same thing

of course.

Not sure if I should try the 1V or 1CP-AL-LAD first though.... just got a few of each to test the waters....I'm actually not a fan of 1cP-LSD (i mean id happily take it if that was the only Lysergamide but its my least favorite that ive tried so far) so I'm not sure how the 1cp-AL-LAD will act with my body....I have extremely high expectations of 1V though!

After sitting on it for a bunch of years, wife and I each took 250ug for our first time with AL-LAD the other day. On the positives, I found this an exceedingly gentle dose in terms of mind-fuckery as well as physical discomfort (one of my few psychedelic come-ups where I didn't feel terribly uncomfortable). Music appreciation was quite high. Lots of enjoyable moments and a generally enjoyable ride.


That said: We both basically found it without much character and, finally, weren't sure what the point was. Maybe that's more reflective of where we're at in our lives at the moment and what we're looking for. In addition, both us experienced some amount of jaw tension (though not crazy).


For my part (and I appreciate that this might be idiosyncratic to me) I also found the flavor of the drug surprisingly similar to 4-ho-met, but not as good: I find 4-ho-met superior both in terms of the visuals, emotional intensity/enhancement, as well as the psychedelic head-space.


I think the next time I try AL-LAD will be as a quarter-tab mini-dose. Don't think I'll do a macro again (at least on its own). Too many more worthwhile chemicals, and not enough time in my life. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Sounds like possibly an underdose [@Listening](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/135453/) ? I've had a single tab absolutely melt my world into utter discombobulated ridiculous-ness, and also a single tab seem like a sip of lemonade on warm afternoon - it seems like the dosing on AL-LAD tabs was terribly inconsistent. 


Interesting that you note it's similarities with 4-ho-met. I thought the same, but wrt 4-aco-met. I'd love to try the base MET.

Interesting possibility. These were old blotters (supposedly) dosed at 125ug each. They had been stored in the freezer under good conditions (I've never noted any degradation with any of my other things stored along side it)... But it's possible! The only reason I suspect it's not a dose issue is because of the jaw tension (I was also quite impaired; I couldn't do any technical work when I tried). That led me to believe that the dose was indeed highish, but maybe that's not right?


I also have a different (more recent) batch of AL-LAD dosed at 150ug each... I guess I'll have to try and see... ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


I might also be understating what I experienced. During the trip I said things like, "well this chemical is just lovely." It was quite nice for what it was.

My tabs are dosed at 150ug. Is one tab enough to get a 100ug lsd type of trip? I don’t want to underdose which keeps happening to me on new drugs because I am cautious, but to give an idea, I usually take 100ug lsd or 2-3.5g mushrooms or 25mg 4.x.met.

I found 150ug of AL-LAD to typically feel lighter than a 100ug dose LSD, with exceptions due to the inconsistent tabs.

But 300ug would be too much for a lightweight such as myself, wouldn’t it? Maybe I’ll do 150 and have a half tab waiting to go…

Al-LAD is kinda wierd. 150 µg are kinda weak, but when I took 300 µg it melted my mind into fractals. It was awesome, but something I would only do in very specific, controlled settings. Eth-LAD is the same in that way for me.

Ime at lower range AL-LAD feels significantly weaker than LSD but in higher range it actually feels significantly different than LSD. Like Img_9999 says, melting into fractals.


It sure is a great drug that I’m quite sad I’ll encounter again who knows when. But than some 1x-AL-LAD should be about the same. Imho it’s the candy psychedelic of lysergamides.

I think what's going on with AL-LAD is that it has lower affinity for the relevant receptors than LSD, but a higher level of agonism when it approaches saturation, if that makes sense - so basically a steeper curve in dose vs. response.

Yes, it's been noted for quite some time that this appears to be the relative dose curve for AL-LAD.

IMO until we have a properly regulated supply, I see no point in making dose-response claims. Unless you somehow have access to the pure product and the proper measuring apparatus for preparing doses, no one here knows if "150 µg" tabs are actually that, and the wild variation in effects many of us have experienced with these kinds of blotters seems to indicate that dosage has pretty much always been inconsistent.

That's a good point [@blistersinthedark](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/305852/), since the dosing seems to have been a bit all over the place, we really have to consider that before jumping to conclusions about the dose curve. Of course if there is a steeper dose curve, dosing variations would seem more pronounced.


In theory someone who's experienced with "thumbprint" level LSD doses could take a massive dose of AL-LAD and check if it exceeds the level of a massive LSD dose. If AL-LAD is indeed further towards being a full-agonist than LSD is, it should produce a more powerful trip at "saturation" levels. This would be dangerous though. For example the NBOMes, which are meant to be full-agonists, seem to become very sketchy at higher doses. 


I can't remember if there are many reports in here on very large doses of AL-LAD.

I had tested tabs so I confidently knew dose, both with LSD and AL-LAD.


Can’t really imagine any lysergamide in multi mg dose being something you can use to compare anything. I only done that with 1p-LSD so who knows. When I took “index print” dose trip started within seconds and I “fractaled out” within minute or so, or what seemed like a minute. In a sense it was less intense than many few hundred µ trips. My intense poly-drug use at the time had to do something with it, but than again it was essentially an OD and as with any drug at some point you get knocked out, in one way or another.


##### 1p-lsd index finger print

It was a gloomy afternoon and life was bitter-sweet. I was already high but honestly don’t remember on what exactly but for those days I was still more on a sober side than what I would call being properly high. And idea of needing some healing power of psychedelics struck me.  I found myself...

Tested how? What do you mean you "confidently knew the dose"? Sorry to be a contrarian, but as I've said above, unless you've got pure raw material and a fully working lab setup (and the skills to use it), you do not know the dose, period. Maybe you "know" what one sub-unit (i.e. one tab) of each sheet subjectively feels like, but that's the only reference point you'll have, and even that isn't guaranteed to be consistent from tab to tab (uneven distribution, hot spots, whatever you want to call it). At best you can roughly compare ("1 tab of this feels stronger/equal/weaker than 1 tab of that"), but you simply cannot put a precise number on any of it.

Why the fuck I would go into details for some stranger on web who doesn’t believe what I say cuz I’m just some stranger on the web, right?


But so you don’t have to break your head with it every time you see someone like me post something like this I’ll tell you.


When AL-LAD was legal I made mine own solution with amount weighted out on a very precise scale.


When I had some *legal* LSD I tested it where many other BL folks test their stuff.


I’m not sure if you knew it but making tabs ain’t rocket science but primary school math (at least where I live until you finish primary school you know enough math to make tabs or solution with wanted strength). And over years I had many different tabs, dots and liquids, so many that I would figure out rough estimates for them even without lab testing cuz shockingly if you look hard enough, with psychedelics you end up on truthful market.

Good for you if you've been able to measure doses with more accuracy than the average tripper! Unfortunately when it comes to novel lysergamides the rest of us mortals only have access to tabs prepared by a single opaque entity operating in a legal grey area and have no choice but to take their word for it when it comes to dosage (and as you surely know, those aren't available as powder anymore, so very few can repeat what you did). All I'm saying is anyone should take any claim regarding lysergamide doses with a grain of salt and approach each new batch they receive with caution. Ditto for street LSD. IMO, of course. But feel free to yell at me some more!

In **fact** I had no idea lysergamides ain’t available in powder form any-more. Why so? I’ve been under the rock & sponge for some time but back in the day you could get as little as 0.1g.


Part about street acid, well when you say street acid I’m not sure what you think about as where I live there ain’t no street dealers but there’s street...and there’s forest and mountains…


Up in the mountains and in a forest you don’t have people bragging about their 666µ tabs and people know 95 – 105µ tabs ain’t weak tabs at all.. When 180µ *stars* *sprinkle* down the street , street folks eat ½ when they want to trip really **hard**… those were regularly chopped out


But, damn man, if it’s really no powder lysergamides policy, that **sucks**!

Just to add, yesterday at a wedding i took


T0: 1,5mg 5meomipt

T+4 75mcg Al-LAD


Wonderful combination. Great for speeching![😉](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png), socializing and dancing without things getting too psychedelic ![👍](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f44d.png)

300ug… took 225, then 75 an hour in. I took a tryptamine 2 weeks ago so don’t know if there is still tolerance.


It was not at all too strong. Eyes open it was pretty boring, but I think I needed to be in nature to enjoy that (I was home). Eyes closed it was sweet. At one point I felt some serious entity stuff happening.  Lots of audio distortion.  


Didn’t live up to the “eye candy” description I’ve read. 100ug acid gives me way more visuals. But there were a lot of waves of pleasure like what I get on certain tryptamines. Anyways, was fun, prolly won’t buy more.

I like LSD visuals better than AL-LAD while AL-LAD is ime “candy” in a sense it’s really a feel good/great psychedelic. While about 100µ of LSD on occasion can feel more intense than double dose of AL-LAD visuals are still more pronounced with double dose of AL-LAD ime.

Hello, I have a quick question.


Never done AL-LAD. I've done psychedelics many times but mostly in low doses (LSD up to 100ug, 1cp-LSD up to 100, shrooms up to 2.5g, DMT once). I have quite a lot of experience with MDMA in the past (unfortunately). I am moderately sensitive to lysergamides, 75-90ug of LSD is quite fine to me, 100ug gets a bit complicated (though 100ug 1cp is quite fine). I very rarely trip at home and mostly in social settings (like festivals, raves or in the nature at parks or beaches), that probably explains it why I prefer lower doses. I am kinda in control there and I take precautions about set and setting, but well yeah, sometimes the setting isn't quite optimal and things can get a little bit out of control, anyway somehow it never got catastrophically bad until now.


I obtained some AL-LAD 150ug blotters recently. I've never tried AL-LAD and from what I read, it gets very confusing. I intend to try it for the first time at an event (tech-house open-air one that will last about 8-9 hours). Given my prior psychedelics experience, what would be the best way to proceed with dosage?


I intend to take 100ug first and in the next 1-1.5 hours after it kicks in, if I find it weak, I would redose the other 50ug. Is that a good idea? Also, I read that it lasts less than regular acid so would it make sense to redose more in like about 3-4 hours to prolong it? How much should I redose?


What I specially try to avoid is the mindfuck I get from dosing acid higher than needed in a crowded place (but it would be openair one, not indoors, so it shouldn't be that bad).


Also there is a possibility to candyflip. I must say I never liked candyflipping though. I've tried that twice - first time it was underdosed (both L and M) and it was kinda unpleasant (sometimes M took control, sometimes L and it was confusing). The other time, they both syngergized brutally and got me very overwhelmed (in a physical sense) - I was sweating, hyperthermic, high BPM and had to urgently get out of the crowd to breathe some fresh air for like half an hour. Dose was about 75ug L and half (a very strong) pill.


So is 100 or 100+50 first hour too high in such a setting given my humble experience? How does 100ug (or 150ug) of AL-LAD compare to say 75ug of LSD (which I find very tolerable and nice in such a setting)? If I redose in 3-4 hours, would that prolong the experience just like with LSD, or it would make it more intensive (which I want to avoid)?


Would it make sense to candyflip on my first AL-LAD experience (100 or 150ug) with a very low MDMA dose - between 1/4 and 1/2 of a good pill - which would be probably about 50-70mg of M?


Please bear with my poor English, I am not a native speaker.

[@gwgw](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/575551/) welcome!


150µg of AL-LAD is *usually* lighter than something like 100µg of LSD or 1cp-LSD. You'll probably be just fine with 150µg of AL-LAD, don't sweat it, but it doesn't hurt to break it up into 100+50. I'd say wait no more than an hour before redosing if you do that. If you wait 3-4h it will probably just prolong the trip without adding much to the depth.


An AL-LAD candyflip with a small amount of MDMA would be nice but I've never tried. I had the plan to, but then the trip hit hard so we didn't bother. I think 50-70mg sounds perfect. Given your past experience with candyflipping it doesn't sound like a good idea to combo on your first AL-LAD trip tbh. If you do entertain the idea, wait until the trip sets in before you decide.


Your english is good.


You sound very responsible, have fun!

Did the experiment. I have mixed feelings.


Took 120ug. It was a very mild experience. So a little later than 1 hour after feeling the first effects, I took 60ug more for total of 180ug. This is a wonderful substance.


I am bad at writing reports (and my native language is not English, well southeastern europe ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) ), but I'd try.


Took 120ug at 16:30. Felt first slight effects at 17:20. Redosed 60ug at 18:00 as it all seemed very underwhelming. AL-LAD is super weird. Like I said, I am relatively sensitive to psychedelics, 2-2.5mg cubensis trips are super intensive for me. I am kinda scared to go above 100ug of LSD for my trips cause it really brings me on the brink of functioning properly around other people (I hate solo tripping and I am an old family guy with kids and so on). I have almost never had bad experiences with LSD, but I've had some hard ones, especially the feeling that sensory input is overwhelming, the out-of-body moments, short-term memory loss (ego dissolution?) and stuff. I can experience all of it on just 80-90ug of acid.


AL-LAD was nothing like it. After redosing those 60ug, I could then feel some slight anxiety, but that was nothing compared to even 75ug of 1cp-lsd. My head was almost completely sober which is very weird. No racing thoughts. No emotional rollercoasters.


I think I reached the peak around 20:30 (+2.5 hours). I am rather surprised by two things. First, the music was magical almost the same way as it is on acid. Very immersive. Second thing I did not expect is the AL-LAD trip very much reminded me of a MDMA experience. It was super euphoric, very stimulating to an extent I found it a bit forceful and unpleasant. Because with MDMA there is that bliss where you don't give a shit about everything. But with AL-LAD this lacks, so you are very much aware of your body sensations and they aren't exactly pleasant. I've had similar LSD trips though, so no big worries. My head was completely sober. I just can't believe this is a lysergamide compound. I've had some slight LSD-like headspace for just couple of minutes, but besides that, I was completely sober, just euphoric and super positive.


I did not have ANY visuals except for a brief period of time where things kinda breathed and shifted for a while (some colors were weird and intensified thorough the trip though). My LSD trips are normally not very visual anyway (shroom and high dose 2c-b trips are much more visual for me TBH).


It all more or less abruptly ended somewhere around 22 (+4 hours). Well not all, but the weird headspace more or less went about normal around that time, the euphoric feelings and stimulation lingered on but were significantly weaker. It was nothing like the LSD comedown which for me comes in waves (sometimes really tormenting as I just want it to stop). Comedown was super fast and yet super smooth.


I did not candyflip (scared to try). I did however do a rather stupid thing. Snorted some coke after the comedown at around 22:30. The moment coke kicked in, it killed all of the remaining magic. Very stupid decision. Now I am writing this post struggling with my insomnia ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


Another thing I was about to ask. The tabs were slightly bitter at first and they appeared to give that slight numbling sensation on the tongue at the spot I held the tab. This freaked me out a bit (trying a new RC even though it's from a proven good vendor I've ordered from before). I even considered spitting it out initially. But the slightly bitter part was just the first seconds and the numbing part was very mild and probably somewhat psychosomatic from anxiety. I've never taken NBOMEs and I don't know what it feels like but I presume they are much more bitter and the numbing is hmm *real*. But still, I've never had tabs like this before. Perhaps paranoia? You ever found your AL-LAD tabs a little bit bitter?


This thing also fucked up my temperature regulation quite well (but regular LSD does that for me as well). I just think AL-LAD does it a little bit more for me. But less so than MDMA. I was feeling a bit hot and was sweating quite a lot at some point.


Overall, this was super fun experience, though unexpectedly not quite deep (I read it doesn't give you the headspace but I just didn't believe that was possible). It does indeed lack the mindfuck. It is super tolerable. Also I don't know why people describe it as very visual, for me LSD is much more visual.


I think I need to try a higher dose but I am kinda afraid reading all those reports about the response curve being very steep and 200-250ug being somewhat hardcore. I took 180 and I just can't imagine 200 to be that more serious.

Interesting to read about your experience with AL-LAD. good choice to not combine with MDMA for your first time.


In my experience, LSD blotters (I've never had AL-LAD) have been very slightly bitter, maybe due to the ink.  But NBOMe was much more noticeably bitter

Did AL-LAD candyflip finally.


Me and my wife each took 150ug of AL-LAD at an openair music event. It was quite underwhelming for me, just felt a little euphoric with no visuals of any kind and the music didn't sound as magical as the previous time I tested AL-LAD. Decided to take a small quantity of M (like about 50mg) as I've had some very intense experiences candyflipping in the past and I am a bit wary of it. Well it totally blasted me, it was as if I took at least 100-150mg - heart pounding, sweating all over, feeling rather hot and at some point I felt a little bit scared. Apparently AL-LAD potentiates M quite a lot just like L does for me. Since the quantity was low, I had almost zero after-effects the next day, even had good appetite.


I remember at some point my wife said AL-LAD feels too weak and she barely feels anything and I agreed. Somewhat 30 minutes later she was laughing all the time speaking stuff that didn't make a lot of sense (like "I fell asleep while dancing and then I woke up and then I fell asleep again and then I woke up and the funny thing is each time I wake up I knew precisely what the time is, no need to look at my phone"). She said she had a lot of ideas that she found hard to explain to me. She was also having a lot of visuals for hours (when we got back in the appartment hours later, she said the pictures on the wall looked 3-dimensional and were melting and morphing). She was really enjoying it. Apparently it had full-blown psychedelic effect on her (she is sensitive to psychedelics).


Apparently 150ug is too low for me but I am not sure what a good dose would be as I am kind of afraid by that steep dose-response curve. Is say 200ug very different to 150ug?


AL-LAD seems to form a very strong tolerance too. One week later, I took 1v-LSD (100ug and then 50ug some time later). It felt like 75ug of L or even less intense with zero visuals but a good mindspace.

Yes, my experience too. The tolerance from AL-LAD has been stronger than what I would have expected from it's relatively mild effects.

I'm thinking about trying some of this stuff this weekend, as I'm looking for something visual, with less of an introspective headspace. 


I've seen the jesters and pretty comfortable in that world, so perhaps 300ug will be my trial dose. Does that set off any alarms for anyone?

Depends on the exact tabs, and you. Some "150µg" al-lad tabs that seem to be dosed heavier and I wouldn't want to take two of them. I have some others from the same vendor but a different sheet that are also supposed to be 150, but are way lighter, and I'd be fine to take two of.


The only safe advice is to take 1 on your first try. But if you don't have a strong one (which does seem to be the case most of the time), some people would be underwhelmed. To me personally a light trip is good so I don't mind. But if you're not comfortable having a light trip, and you also have had lots of experience with heavy trips (just in case) it might be ok to take 2.

300µ is a big dose but if you have experience with such doses of LSD you wont have problem handling even significantly higher dose, at least it’s like that for most people. But the catch is that you really tried heavy doses of LSD and not eat a 3 tabs believing you ate 300µ while you ate 100 or 150µ. Back in the day I saw this a countless times, people eating first real cca 100µ tab realizing they were lied every time about dose. It seems acid is now abundant but that doesn’t make crooks disappear.

I sincerely appreciate this advice. I am considering 150µg, but I only allow myself to trip once a month, so I'd really like each experience to be somewhat profound. I've recently taken a couple of 2.5 gram cubensis trips with my wife that were a little underwhelming for me, but great for her.


I've had 200µg of regular LSD a few times and experienced a thought loop once, which wasn't terrible, but also not much fun.


This will be my first try from this batch, so I'm slightly concerned. I've been pretty good about trusting my instincts, so perhaps I'll make my decision the day of the trip.


Thank you!

Also note that there seems to be a different dose-response curve with LSD vs AL-LAD and ETH-LAD. The latter two seem to scale more steeply - so if you put dosage on the x-axis and magnitude of effects on the y, you would see that LSD rolls off gently as the dose goes up, whereas the curve for AL- and ETH- seems to go steeper and intersect and surpass LSD's curve at some point. So while 100µg of AL-LAD is weaker than 100µg of LSD, if you compare 300µg of both you might see that AL-LAD has a stronger effect.


I'm not sure if there is any data on receptor bindings that supports this or not, or even if most fellow trippers would agree, but it's something I think I've noticed and others on here seemed to agree about.

This is so true, the LSD i ate as a teenager was way underdosed compared to what ive gotten as i got older. Like one of the 100ug tabs i have now is pretty damn powerful compared to when i ate multiple blotters back then. It wasnt until around 08 when i got the WoW sheets that i believe i truly had blotters that were a minimum of 100ugs. And the reason i can even gauge all of this is by the wonderful LL's giving us 1p-LSD and etc. That allowed us to truly feel what 100ugs should be and now i can guesstimate much closer when dosing tabs. Back when i was a teen id say most blotter was 50ug range...

It seems like 300µg AL-LAD might be a bit too much for someone with only the experience with 100µg LSD.


However, if someone (me) were to have experience with 200µg LSD (this is estimated - I used a dropper every time), could 300µg AL-LAD potentially be too much for a first trip with a sitter (my wife and dogs)?


My setting is a bunch of acres of untouched forest and a hammock. Pretty cool.


I think it would actually be less than the estimated 300µg, as I will be taking a quarter off for testing.

There’s always that – potentially. But I don’t think there’s enough potential for a really bad outcome with lysergamides to worry about that at all. That applies to most people who enjoy psychedelics and ensure they take them in a good set and setting.

The highest dose LSD I've taken is 150ug, but that's a lot for me and I prefer around 75-100.


Now as per AL-LAD, the highest I've taken is 180ug. It was a very positive and euphoric experience, but almost 100% clear-headed with almost zero mindfuck. Slight visuals. It was good experience but compared to LSD I'd say it feels similar to 50-75ug dose. 150ug of AL-LAD is underwhelming already and I once tried half tab of AL-LAD (75ug) it was definitely underwhelming (as in I could feel it barely, just slight simulation).


Completely different according to my wife though (50ug of LSD is already too much for her, she prefers mini-doses of 20-30). 150ug AL-LAD for her has full-blown psychedelic effects with lots of visuals and quite some mindfuck, I'd say from what I see probably similar to what 100-120ug of LSD do for me. 


There is definitely a difference between 150 and 180ug of AL-LAD (subjectively speaking, the difference between 75 and 150 is less than the difference between 150 and 180) which is something that make me cautious trying to up the dose. I will probably try with 200ug next, just not in a hurry.

I've taken 150µg tabs that were a light walk in the park, and 150µg tabs that were absolutely boggling mind-fuckery (mind you never unpleasant! Just extremely confusing, hilarious and visually dripping with psychedelia). From the same original reptillian chemist, same vendor, different sheets/batches. Just really want to hammer home that these doses are not created equal. They could be more normalized nowadays, I'm speaking of batches sourced many years ago fwiw.

I ended up with 150µg for an initial dose. 


It was remarkably easy to navigate with some light OEV drifting for a couple of hours. CEVs weren't high level, but they were there - mostly liquid metal with a handful of colorful spinning objects at the peak. The thing that struck me the most was the clear headspace and ability to sleep, just 8-10 hours later. I like it.

The dose response curve is insane with this one as I empirically found out just recently.


150ug feels like the "giggly funny" thing for me Like a mini-dose of acid, around 30-40ug.


Then you want to up the dose but you are afraid because you've read that this thing has a steep response curve. So you try 180ug.


It's still more or less the "giggly funny" thing with some extra visuals added in, but nothing spectacular.


Then you try 200ug. Which is more or less the same except that visuals are somewhat more pronounced.


Then you courageously take 225ug on a music event because why not, it gotta be fun.


SURPRISE!


Forget about AL-LAD lacking the "serious" headspace. I  had a full-blown trip in a rather suboptimal set&setting. Definitely unexpected. I would compare that to a 120ug of acid, with that extra chilling bonus - you weren't supposed to trip at all but yet you do now.


It has all the naughty aspects of acid. My naive idea that "no bad trip is possible on AL-LAD" was badly shattered. I wasn't prepared for what followed. Not rather difficult to get on the negative train of thoughts for sure.


It was a GREAT experience but also a very unexpected one.


AL-LAD requires some caution - as a relatively small increase in dose can obviously lead to very different effects that might not be expected.


P.S Yes, I am irresponsive and stupid.

I may write a trip report soon. Just my two cents from my first AL-LAD experience three days ago:


Setting was an outside birthday party.

Most of us took 3/4s of a 150mcg blotter, followed by another half blotter an hour later.

One person took one blotter + a half, one more hard headed person took 1 + 1 blotter.


It took about 50mins for the initial dose to show first effects. We kept it under our tongue for 20min & swallowed the paper.


There was some bodyload during the first two hours. It didn't feel uncomfortable though. Like being charged up with energy.


It were the EU blotters, that have the molecular structure on one side & AL-LAD written all over them on the other side.


It was very handleable & could've been a tad stronger.

I had a good amount of morphing & breathing when looking at trees & mountains that were far away. Not many visual changes when looking at close things though. Everything looked more green / blue than usual.


I'd recommend starting with one and a half blotters.


They seem to be a bit weaker than standard black market LSD blotters.


All in all a great compound.

I can't ascribe differences between AL-LAD & LSD, I'm not experienced enough for that.

Sounds normal, but as Gwgw said in previous post, AL-LAD has a step dose-response curve that usually starts above 225 mcg. So above that, I'd recommend increases of just 25-50 mcg each time, and not to jump to 300 mcg directly. I'd also ad that in my experience, AL-LAD gives more tolerance than you'd expect from from the intensity of the trip.

When I first got this back in 2014, I think I took it twice at 150 and had mild, fin trips, then the third time jumpped straight into 250 and reality exploded into fractals.... nice memory.

At some point, not sure where, it's probably more powerful than equal amount LSD. Like 600 mics of AL-LAD was stronger than 600 mics of LSD or 1p. I almost gave up on AL-LAD when my initial 150 mic dose was unsatisfying, i took 300 and was also still unimpressed it wasnt until i took 450 that I saw it really shine. The dosages in Tikal were really low, but people take everything in that book as gospel. So when I hear them poo poo like PRO-LAD its always in the back of mind they maybe didnt take enough, maybe its a great substance at huge doses....

I agree with this, and also not sure where that tipping point is.

I think the dose response curve starts out lower for AL-LAD, but is steeper and it starts to saturate at a higher level (of trippiness) than LSD does.

^I think it's about 450ug. I recall I had 25 of those EU blotters and they felt weak as fuck at one or two or even three blotters at times. I started just taking a five-strip each time and holy shit, those were some of my most insane trips.

I'm a bit of a hardhead, and I thought 450 was a bit much. 225-300 is my sweet spot range. One thing about AL-LAD though, it's a great complement to 2cs as well, great with 2c-b, 2c-ef, and 2c-e. I'm planning to try this with 2c-i and 2c-t-2 as well at some point this year.

Fun fact to note down: Back in 2014 or so I bought 5 tabs of al lad and 10 of eth lad to try them out. I actually never did - just left them in a baggie, that one in a bigger, darker one, and that one in a small jar with a bunch of silica gel (alongside other stuff). And is stood there for over 8 years.

Well I woke up today and felt like making history so I took 150 ug of al lad to see if it was still active. The paper looks quite worse, it was clear with the molecules on it, and now its cardboard-like. I took it 1:30 h ago and it has degraded a lot, but its clearly still active. I would say i'm at a +1.5. Will edit if things change.

edit: the +1.5 changed to a +1 at T+2 and stayed there for some 4 hours. Baseline after 6. Will try doubling the dose to see if I get a full trip with the remaining 4 blotters

Nice story with the old Tabs. I got some from 2017 and I think if you put these in the fridge properly sealed, there is not much degradation, same with my 4-ho-met. They did not lose any potency.

If you double your AL-LAD dose, be careful it can hit you with surprise if you pass the 225ug amount.

I see. I kind of had to keep them in my closet for children safety reasons, so, not much to be done there. I have some 4 subs in there as well, should try them next time to see if they're still active.

To reply about the conservation part, I bought some 1cp-LSD (100µ blotters) a few years back and just let them in the freezer in a zip bag (not a very good one tbh). After 3 years in the black, we eat some with my fiancée and I had to say that I expected them to be less potent...and not at all lol


3 trips under the buckle since half-july, always between 50-75µ just to dip toes and tried it in a public setting (music show), and I can say that those blotters keep their potency very well ! Yes, I tried them at the time I got them and really there is no potency lost ime


Cheers !
