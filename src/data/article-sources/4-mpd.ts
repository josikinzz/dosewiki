4-Methylpentedrone (also known as 4-MPD and 4-Methyl-α-methylamino-valerophenone), is a stimulant medication of the cathinone class, invented in 1960 .
It is a higher homolog of 4-methylmethcathinone (mephedrone) and 4-methylbuphedrone (4-MeMABP), and the p-methyl derivative of pentedrone. It can also be viewed as the methylamino analog of pyrovalerone.
A related compound, 4-methyl-α-ethylaminopentiophenone (4-MEAP), has been found to be incorrectly sold as 4-methylpentedrone.
