**Diethyltryptamine** (also known as **N,N-DET** or **DET** ) is a synthetic [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) [tryptamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tryptamine) and a close structural analog of [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT) (Dimethyltryptamine). It is extremely uncommon and has little history of human usage.

In the 1950s, the endogenous production of psychoactive agents was considered to be a potential explanation for the hallucinatory symptoms of some psychiatric diseases; this is known as the transmethylation hypothesis.

Early studies of DET as well as other psychedelics were mainly focused on their presumed psychotomimetic properties. Researchers theorized that abnormal metabolites of endogenous chemicals such as tryptamine, serotonin, and tryptophan could be the explanation for mental disorders such as schizophrenia, or psychosis.

## Chemistry

DET, or N,N-diethyltryptamine, is a synthetic indole alkaloid molecule of the [tryptamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tryptamine) class. Tryptamines share a core structure comprised of a bicylic indole heterocycle attached at R 3 to an amino group via an ethyl side chain. DMT contains two ethyl groups CH 2 CH 3 - bound to the terminal amine R N of its tryptamine backbone. DET has many substituted analogues such as [4-HO-DET](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-HO-DET) ("ethocin").

DET is an analogue of the common tryptamine hallucinogen N,N-Dimethyltryptamine or DMT. Although DET is a synthetic compound with no known natural sources, it has been used in conjunction with the mycelium of *Psilocybe cubensis* to produce the synthetic chemicals 4-PO-DET (Ethocybin) and 4-HO-DET (Ethocin), as opposed to the naturally occurring 4-PO-DMT (Psilocybin) and 4-HO-DMT (Psilocin). Isolation of the alkaloids resulted in 3.3% 4-HO-DET and 0.01-0.8% 4-PO-DET.

## Pharmacology

Due to the lack of research regarding the substance, all discussion regarding the pharmacology of it is purely based on its structure and subjective effect similarities to other [tryptamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tryptamine) [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) such as [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) and [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT) . With this in mind, DET is thought to act as an [5-HT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) 2A partial agonist. Unlike [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT) , the ethyl groups add protection against the monoamine oxidase enzyme system, allowing DET to be orally active, while DMT is not.

DET is sometimes preferred over DMT because it can be taken orally, whereas DMT cannot. This is because the enzyme monoamine oxidase degrades DMT into an inactive compound before it is absorbed. To overcome this, it must be administered in a different manner, i.e. intravenously, intramuscularly, by inhalation, by insufflation, rectally, or ingested along with an inhibitor of monoamine oxidase. Because DET has ethyl groups attached to its nitrogen atom, monoamine oxidase is unable to degrade it. This is also true for many other tryptamines with larger nitrogen substituents.

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*

## Toxicity and harm potential

The toxicity and long-term health effects of recreational DET has not been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dose is unknown. This is because DET is a [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) with a limited history of human usage. However, it is presumed to have a similar toxicity profile as [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT) due to similarities in their chemical structure.

Anecdotal reports from those who have tried DET suggests that there are no negative health effects attributed to simply trying the substance by itself at low to moderate doses and using it very sparingly (but nothing can be completely guaranteed). [Independent research](https://www.google.com/) should always be done to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe before consumption.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this substance.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

Although no formal studies have been conducted, it is believed that DET is not habit-forming and the desire to use it can actually decrease with use.

Tolerance to the effects of DET is built almost immediately after ingestion. After that, it takes about 3 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 7 days to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). DET presents cross-tolerance with all [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) , meaning that after the consumption of DET all psychedelics will have a reduced effect.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **[Lithium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_(medication))** - Lithium is often used as treatment for bipolar disorder. It can dangerously amplify the intensity of psychedelics and has been strongly linked with psychosis and seizures. The causes are poorly understood, but it may be due to its [glutaminergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Glutamate) and [GABAergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GABA) properties. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants)** - Stimulants affect many parts of the brain. Combined with psychedelics, stimulation can turn into uncontrollable [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [panic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) , [thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops) and [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) . This interaction may cause elevated risk of psychosis. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol)** - Tramadol lowers the seizure threshold and [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) may act as triggers for seizures, particularly in those who are predisposed to them. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
