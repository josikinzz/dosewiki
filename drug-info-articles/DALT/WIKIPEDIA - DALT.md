Diallyltryptamine (DALT), also known as N,N-diallyltryptamine, is a tryptamine derivative which has been identified as a designer drug.

## Use and effects

According to Alexander Shulgin in his book TiHKAL (Tryptamines I Have Known and Loved), the dose of DALT is greater than 40 mg orally and its duration is unknown. Its effects were not described. Per Stephen Szara and colleagues in much earlier publications however, DALT and other extended N,N-dialkyltryptamines produce similar effects to dimethyltryptamine (DMT) but are longer-lasting, with durations of up to 3 hours.

## Interactions

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

The receptor interactions of DALT have been studied. The drug produces the head-twitch response, a behavioral proxy of psychedelic effects, in rodents.

## Chemistry

DALT has been used as an intermediate in the preparation of radiolabeled diethyltryptamine (DET).

### Synthesis

The chemical synthesis of DALT has been described.

### Analogues

Analogues of DALT include 4-HO-DALT, 4-AcO-DALT, 5-MeO-DALT, methylallyltryptamine (MALT), propylallyltryptamine (PALT), and isopropylallyltryptamine (iPALT), among others.

## History

DALT was first described in the scientific literature by Stephen Szara and colleagues by 1962.
