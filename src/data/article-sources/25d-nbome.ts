### Insufflated

**Dosage:**
- Heavy: The NBOMe series can be fatal when insufflated.[1][2][3] It is strongly discouraged.

**Duration:**
**Members of the [NBOMe series](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/NBOMe) have been linked to numerous overdoses and fatalities.**
 
It is strongly discouraged to [insufflate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Routes_of_administration#Insufflation) (snort) or take higher doses of these compounds. Please see [this section](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25x-NBOMe#Toxicity_and_harm_potential) for more details.
**25D-NBOMe** (also known as **2C-D-NBOMe** or **NBOMe-2C-D** ) is novel [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) substance of the [phenethylamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamine) class. 25D-NBOMe produces an array of primarily visual and stimulating [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) effects when [administered](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Routes_of_administration) .

The name 25D-NBOMe, which short-hand for 2C-D-NBOMe, is a derivative of the phenethylamine psychedelic [2C-D](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-D) . It was first synthesized in 2011 by Martin Hansen and subsequently had its activity explored in 2012 and 2014, where it was established to be a potent [agonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist) at the 5-HT 2A receptor that produces effects similar to other members of the [25x-NBOMe](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25x-NBOMe) series.

It is worth noting that compounds of the [NBOMe](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/NBOMe) family are not [orally](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Orally) active and should be administered [sublingually](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sublingually) by placing and letting it absorb into one's mouth over a period of 15-25 minutes. 25D-NBOMe can also be vaporized and inhaled to cause significantly more rapid and powerful effects as well as a shorter duration. However, this route of administration is highly advised against due to the difficulties of measuring and handling substances that are both active in the microgram range as well as having a low [therapeutic index](/w/index.php?title=Therapeutic_index&action=edit&redlink=1) .

25D-NBOMe has no history of human use prior to being sold online as a [designer drug](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Designer_drug) in 2010. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] Extremely little is known about the pharmacological properties, metabolism, and toxicity of 25D-NBOMe in humans, and its closely related analogs like [25I-NBOMe](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25I-NBOMe) has been associated with many deaths and hospitalizations. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] Along with its highly sensitive dose-response and unpredictable effects, many reports also suggest that this substance may be overly difficult to use safely. Therefore it is highly advised to approach this poorly understood [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) substance with the proper amount of precaution and [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use#Hallucinogens) when using it.

## Chemistry

25D-NBOMe, or 2C-D-NBOMe, is a serotonergic N-benzyl derivative of the substituted phenethylamine psychedelic known as [2C-D](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-D) . 25D-NBOMe is a substituted phenethylamine with methoxy groups CH 3 O- attached to carbons R 2 and R 5 as well as a methyl group attached to carbon R 4 . It differs from 2C-D structurally through a substitution on the amine (NH2) with a 2-methoxybenzyl (BOMe) group as shown in the image to the right. 25D-NBOMe shares this 2-methoxybenzyl substitution with other chemicals of the NBOMe family. This NBOMe addition contains a methoxy ether CH 3 O- bound to a benzene ring at R 2 .

## Pharmacology

25D-NBOMe has efficacy at the [5-HT2A receptor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin#The_5-HT_system) where it acts as a [partial agonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist#Agonists) . However, the role of these interactions and how they result in the [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) experience continues to remain elusive. The addition of the NBOMe group to the structure results in a sixteen-fold increase in potency when compared to 2C-D, allowing even the most extreme of doses to fit in liquid form onto tabs and blotter paper, which people often mistake for [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) .

## Subjective effects

{ ***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- The physical effects of 25D-NBOMe can be broken down into several components which progressively intensify proportional to dosage. These are described below and generally include: 
- **[Sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation)** & **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)** - In terms of its effects on the subject's physical energy levels, 25D-NBOMe is considered to be able to produce both stimulating and sedating. The sedation it produces can be considered less intense than other psychedelics such as [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) and [4-AcO-DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-AcO-DMT) .
- **[Spontaneous physical sensations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_physical_sensations)** - The "body high" itself can be described as a generally mild, all-encompassing, soft but euphoric tingling sensation. This tingling sensation is also accompanied by spontaneous rushes of euphoria that become longer and more drawn out proportional to the dosage consumed. 
- **[Physical euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria)**
- **[Perception of bodily lightness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perception_of_bodily_lightness)**
- **[Tactile hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_hallucination)**
- **[Nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea)** - As the tripper begins to come up, nausea is not uncommon and can sometimes result in initial vomiting. It passes once this has happened or the trip begins to fully set in. In comparison to other [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) such as [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) , [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) , [2C-E](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-E) and [2C-I](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-I) , this could actually be very considered very mild in its intensity.
- **[Temperature regulation suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Temperature_regulation_suppression)**
- **[Perception of bodily lightness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perception_of_bodily_lightness)** - In terms of the body’s perceived weight, this substance consistently leaves people feeling extremely light, often to the point of total weightlessness.
- **[Tactile hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_hallucination)**
- **[Changes in felt gravity](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Changes_in_felt_gravity)** - Compared to classic [tryptamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tryptamines) , this effect is considerably less intense than what is commonly experienced with [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT) and [Psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) .
- **[Mouth numbing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mouth_numbing)** - Assuming the substance has been taken [sublingually](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sublingual) , the very first physical effect which a person will notice immediately after sublingual absorption is a strong, unpleasant, metallic chemical taste. This is accompanied by a very obvious feeling of general numbness of the tongue and mouth which can stay for up to an hour after the blotter paper has been consumed.
- **[Nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea)** - As the user begins to come up, nausea is not uncommon and can sometimes result in initial vomiting, but passes once this has either happened or the trip begins to fully set in. In comparison to other [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) such as [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) , [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) , [2C-E](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-E) and [2C-I](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-I) , this could actually be very considered very mild in its intensity.
- **[Abnormal heartbeat](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Abnormal_heartbeat)**
- **[Increased heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate)**
- **[Increased blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure)**

- **[Headaches](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Headaches)**
- **[Seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures)** ### Visual effects
 
- #### Enhancements
 
25D-NBOMe presents a mild array of possible visual enhancements which generally includes:
 
- **[Visual acuity enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_acuity_enhancement)**
- **[Colour enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_enhancement)**
- **[Pattern recognition enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition_enhancement)**
 
#### Distortions
 
The visual distortions and alterations which are experienced are detailed below:
 
- **[Drifting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting)** *( [melting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Melting) , [flowing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Flowing) , [breathing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Breathing) and [morphing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#morphing) )* - In comparison to other psychedelics, this effect can be described as bland, slow and smooth in motion, inconsistent in appearance and unrealistic/cartoon-like in style.
- **[Tracers](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tracers)**
- **[After images](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/After_images)**
- **[Symmetrical texture repetition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Symmetrical_texture_repetition)**
- **[Colour shifting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_shifting)**
- **[Diffraction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Diffraction)**
 
#### Geometry
 
The visual geometry that is present throughout this trip is often described as very similar in appearance to that of [DOM](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DOM) . It can be comprehensively described as smooth and organic in style, simple in complexity, fine and zoomed out in detail, slow and fluid in motion, structured in shape, colorful in scheme, bright in color, and rounded across its corners.
 
25D-NBOMe’s geometry is reported to lead to [level 8A](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Level_8A) visual geometry with experiences [level 8B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Level_8B) remaining so far unconfirmed within this substance. It also seems to consistently build up in visual intensity when the user stares at a central point. This eventually envelopes the visual field and creates the sensation that the user has broken through into a continuously shifting geometric landscape or structure with a vast sense of physical size attributed to it.
 
#### Hallucinatory states
 
25D-NBOMe is capable of producing a full range of hallucinatory states within the level 1 - 3 range extremely consistently within doses higher than of 2mg. These effects include:
 
- **[Transformations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Transformations)**
- **[Internal hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucination)** - ( *[settings, sceneries, and landscapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Settings,_sceneries,_and_landscapes)* ; *[perspective hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perspective_hallucinations)* and *[scenarios and plots](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenarios_and_plots)* )
- **[External hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/External_hallucination)** - ( *[autonomous entities](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Autonomous_entities)* ; *[settings, sceneries, and landscapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Settings,_sceneries,_and_landscapes)* ; *[perspective hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perspective_hallucinations)* and *[scenarios and plots](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenarios_and_plots)* ) ### Cognitive effects
 
- The cognitive effects of 25D-NBOMe are remarkably light and underwhelming in comparison to more traditional [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) . It is not uncommon for people to report feeling that their thought stream has maintained general normality in its specific style throughout moderate to high doses. At heavy doses, however, mild cognitive alterations become present; this dose seems to be lower in proportion to physical effects when compared to [25I-NBOMe](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25I-NBOMe) . The most prominent of these cognitive effects generally include: 
- **[Analysis enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Analysis_enhancement)** - This effect is generally only present at low doses.
- **[Thought acceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_acceleration)** and **[Thought deceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_deceleration)** - Although one of 25D-NBOME's effects is thought acceleration, the opposite may occur at higher doses.
- **[Conceptual thinking](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Conceptual_thinking)** - This effect is considered to be very mild compared to traditional psychedlics.
- **[Anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety)** & **[Paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia)** - This effect seems to occur more readily than other psychedelics, perhaps due to its very prominent stimulating properties 
- **[Feelings of impending doom](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Feelings_of_impending_doom)** - This is generally only experienced during the comedown period or if one has taken a large amount of the substance.
- **[Empathy, affection, and sociability enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Empathy,_affection,_and_sociability_enhancement)** - The [entactogenic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entactogenic) effects range from mild to powerful, but are inconsistently manifested. Entactogenic effects for people who try this substance usually become prominent in the presence of others. These feelings of increased sociability, love and empathy do not seem to be quite as strong or profound as those found within other [entactogens](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entactogens) (such as [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) , [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) and [AMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/AMT) )
- **[Language suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Language_suppression)**
- **[Memory suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Memory_suppression)**

- - **[Dosage independent intensity](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dosage_independent_intensity)** - While the reasons for this are not understood, many reports suggest that this substance can produce unexpectedly strong or weak effects even when taken at the seemingly same dose in an unpredictable manner. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] This may contribute to the relative risk it is poses compared to most other psychedelics.
- **[Synaesthesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Synaesthesia)** - In its fullest manifestation, this is a very rare and non-reproducible effect. Increasing the dosage can increase the likelihood of this occurring, but seems to only be a prominent part of the experience among those who are already predisposed to synaesthetic states. ### Transpersonal effects
 
- While they are occasionally reported, the transpersonal effects produced by this substance seem to be significantly less consistent and reproducible than other [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) , which perhaps corresponds with the mild alterations in the cognitive alterations it produces.

### Experience reports

There are currently no anecdotal reports which describe the effects of this compound within our [experience index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Experience_index) . Additional experience reports can be found here:

- [Erowid Experience Vaults: 25D-NBOMe](https://www.erowid.org/experiences/subs/exp_25DNBOMe.shtml)

## Toxicity and harm potential

25D-NBOMe is a very new substance, and very little is known about its pharmacological risks or its interaction with other substances. The [LD50](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LD50) has not yet been determined. Due to 25D-NBOMe's extreme potency, it should not be insufflated (snorted) as this method of administration appears to have led to several deaths from other NBOMe compounds in the past year.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this substance.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

In terms of its addictive potential, 25D-NBOMe has not been studied formally but many users experience a self-regulating quality. Also, due to its immediate tolerance build up, which lasts up to 2 - 3 weeks after the experience, it is difficult to use this substance compulsively. 25D-NBOMe presents cross-tolerance with all [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) , meaning that after the consumption of 25D-NBOMe all psychedelics will have a reduced effect.

### Overdose

Due to the very high potency and seemingly unpredictable effects the margin between a normal and an overdose of NBOMe compounds is extremely small when compared to many other substances. The exact toxic dose is unclear since it seems to depend a lot on personal physiology, rather than predominantly dose. However, various anecdotal reports suggest that dangerous side effects begin to appear when exceeding 1000 μg and it possibly becoming lethal for the more sensitive people at roughly 2000 μg. Reports of other people surviving much higher doses, sometimes even without any major side effects have been documented as well.

There is also the uncertainty of dosage on blotter paper since it is rather difficult to lay such an exact dosage. Insufflating, vaporizing or drinking tinctures of this substance is highly discouraged because of this and has been tied to many documented deaths . One study found that 25I‐NBOMe and 25C‐NBOMe blotter papers contained 'hotspots' with higher quantities of the drug, implying an inherent risk of overdosing.

The overdose effects of NBOMes are typically a dangerously high [heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate) , [blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure) , [hyperthermia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hyperthermia) and significant [vasoconstriction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction) also accompanied by [confusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Confusion) , [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attack) , aggressive behavior, [numbness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_suppression) or pain, [amnesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amnesia) and often [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizure) . The risks in an overdose include anything from organ failure to cardiac arrest and death [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] . There are also multiple reports of people lethally injuring themselves or falling to death . [Benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) or [antipsychotics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antipsychotics) can help with the psychological effects during an overdose although medical attention should always be called in even a possible overdose of 25I-NBOMe.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .* Due to the highly unpredictable nature of the NBOMe series, it is generally advised to avoid mixing them with other psychoactive substances.

- **2C-T-X** - The 2C-T-X phenethylamines can be unpredictable in their interactions and the NBOMes are known to be unpredictable even alone. As a result, this combination should be avoided.
- **5-MeO-xxt** - The 5-MeO tryptamines can be unpredictable in their interactions and the NBOMes are known to be unpredictable even alone. As a result, this combination should be avoided.
- **Amphetamines** - Amphetamines and NBOMes both provide considerable stimulation. When combined they can result in tachycardia, hypertension, vasoconstriction and, in extreme cases, heart failure. The anxiogenic and focusing effects of stimulants are also not good in combination with psychedelics as they can lead to unpleasant thought loops. NBOMes are known to cause seizures and stimulants can increase this risk.
- **aMT**
- **Caffeine** - Caffeine can bring out the natural stimulation from psychedelic drugs to make it uncomfortable. High doses can cause anxiety which is hard to handle while tripping.
- **Cannabis** - Cannabis has an unexpectedly strong and unpredictable synergy with the effects of psychedelics. Caution is advised with this combination as it can significantly increase the risk of adverse psychological reactions like [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) , and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) . Users are advised to start off with only a fraction of their normal cannabis dose and take long breaks between hits to avoid over intake.
- **Cocaine** - Cocaine and NBOMes both provide considerable stimulation. When combined they can result in severe vasoconstriction, tachycardia, hypertension, and in extreme cases heart failure.
- **DOx**
- **DXM**
- **[Lithium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_(medication))** [- Lithium is commonly prescribed in the treatment of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder bipolar disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_(medication)) . There is a large body of anecdotal evidence that suggests taking it with psychedelics significantly increases the risk of [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) and [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) . As a result, this combination is strictly discouraged.
- **MAOIs** - MAO-B inhibitors can increase the potency and duration of phenethylamines unpredictably.
- **MDMA**
- **MXE** - As an NMDA antagonist, MXE potentiates NBOMes which can be unpleasantly intense.
- **Tramadol** - Tramadol is well known to lower seizure threshold and NBOMes have also shown a tendency to cause severe seizures

*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/25D-NBOMe*

25D-NBOMe, also known as NBOMe-2C-D and "divination", is a derivative of the phenethylamine derived hallucinogen 2C-D. It acts in a similar manner to related compounds such as 25I-NBOMe, which is a potent agonist at the 5-HT2A receptor. 25D-NBOMe has been sold as a street drug since 2010 and produces similar effects in humans to related compounds such as 25I-NBOMe and 25C-NBOMe. It was banned as a Temporary Class Drug in the UK on 10 June 2013 after concerns about its recreational use.

## Use and effects

The dose range of 25D-NBOMe has been given as 0.3 to 1.2 mg or more sublingually, with a typical dose estimate of 1.0 mg.

## Toxicity and harm potential

### Neurotoxic and cardiotoxic actions

### Emergency treatment

## Interactions

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

25D-NBOMe acts as an agonist of the serotonin 5-HT2 receptors.
The drug produces the head-twitch response, a behavioral proxy of psychedelic-like effects, in rodents.
25D-NBOMe has shown reinforcing effects in rodents. This included conditioned place preference (CPP) and self-administration. Relatedly, the drug has been found to increase dopaminergic signaling in the nucleus accumbens.

## History

25D-NBOMe was first described in the scientific literature by 2012.

## Society and culture

### Legal status

#### China

As of October 2015 25D-NBOMe is a controlled substance in China.

#### Finland

Scheduled in the "government decree on prohibited psychoactive substances in consumer markets".

#### Sweden

Sveriges riksdag added 25D-NBOMe to schedule I ("substances, plant materials and fungi which normally do not have medical use") as narcotics in Sweden as of Aug 1, 2013,  published by Medical Products Agency in their regulation LVFS 2013:15 listed as 25D-NBOMe 2-(2,5-dimetoxi-4-metylfenyl)-N-(2-metoxibensyl)etanamin.

#### United Kingdom

This substance is a Class A drug in the United Kingdom as a result of the N-benzylphenethylamine catch-all clause in the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971.

#### United States

Unregulated at a federal and state level, though arguably may contravene the Federal Analog Act under certain circumstances given its structural and functional similarity to controlled substance 2C-D.
