## Subjective Experience

This is a well known and popular chemical, having been developed in the former
Soviet Union. One claim to fame is that it is mandated for inclusion in a cosmonaut's
medical kit.

It is used as a tranquilliser and an anxiolytic, but is prescribed for a wide range of
ailments, including depression, PTSD and alcoholism. It is sometimes suggested that
it causes less drowsiness than some of the more common remedies.

Whilst its nootropic related properties are less widely documented, it has had a
presence in this field for many years, with claims that it enhances motivation, focus
and concentration being commonplace. Again, however, it is positioned for use
within a regular dosing regime.

On my single experiment, there were definite anxiolytic effects, with something of a
clear headiness also present. I felt a strange artificial sort of well being, and a mood
lift which lasted some hours.

Overall this proved to be one of the most active of the chemical nootropics I sampled,
and one which I may re-test at some point in the future.
