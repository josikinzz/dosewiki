# Morphine
*Source: https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB00295*

## Overview

### Description

This compound belongs to the class of organic compounds known as morphinans. These are polycyclic compounds with a four-ring skeleton with three condensed six-member rings forming a partially hydrogenated phenanthrene moiety, one of which is aromatic while the two others are alicyclic.

### Background

Morphine, the main alkaloid of opium, was first obtained from poppy seeds in 1805.
1
It is a potent analgesic, though its use is limited due to tolerance, withdrawal, and the risk of abuse.
2
Morphine is still routinely used today, though there are a number of semi-synthetic opioids of varying strength such as
codeine
,
fentanyl
,
methadone
,
hydrocodone
,
hydromorphone
,
meperidine
, and
oxycodone
.
Morphine was granted FDA approval in 1941.
13

### Indication

Morphine is used for the management of chronic, moderate to severe pain.
2
Opiods, including morphine, are effective for the short term management of pain. Patients taking opioids long term may need to be monitored for the development of physical dependence, addiction disorder, and drug abuse.
11

### Pharmacodynamics

Morphine binding to opioid receptors blocks transmission of nociceptive signals, signals pain-modulating neurons in the spinal cord, and inhibits primary afferent nociceptors to the dorsal horn sensory projection cells.
1
Morphine has a time to onset of 6-30 minutes.
1
Excess consumption of morphine and other opioids can lead to changes in synaptic neuroplasticity, including changes in neuron density, changes at postsynaptic sites, and changes at dendritic terminals.
3
Intravenous morphine's analgesic effect is sex dependent. The EC
50
in men is 76ng/mL and in women is 22ng/mL.
5
Morphine-6-glucuronide is 22 times less potent than morphine in eliciting pupil constriction.

### Mechanism of Action

Mu-type opioid receptor
Agonist
Kappa-type opioid receptor
Agonist
Delta-type opioid receptor
Agonist

### Absorption

Morphine is absorbed in the alkaline environments of the upper intestine and rectal mucosa.
6
The bioavailability of morphine is 80-100%.
8
There is significant first-pass metabolism, therefore oral doses are 6 times larger than parenteral doses to achieve the same effect. Morphine reaches steady-state concentrations after 24-48 hours.
1
Parenteral morphine has a T
max
of 15 minutes and oral morphine has a T
max
of 90 minutes, with a C
max
of 283nmol/L.
7
,
8
The AUC of morphine is 225-290nmol*h/L.
8

### Metabolism

Morphine is 90% metabolized by glucuronidation by UGT2B7 and sulfation at positions 3 and 6.
4
Morphine can also be metabolized to codeine, normorphine, and morphine ethereal sulfate.

### Half-life

Morphine has a half life of 2-3 hours.
5

### Toxicity

The LD
50
is 0.78µg/mL in males and 0.98µg/mL in females.
9
Patients experiencing an overdose present with respiratory depression, somnolence, skeletal muscle flaccidity, cold and clammy skin, miosis, and mydriasis. Symptoms of overdose can progress to pulmonary edema, bradycardia, hypotension, cardiac arrest, and death.
12
Treat overdose with symptomatic and supportive treatment which may include the use of oxygen, vasopressors, and naloxone.

### Drug Interactions

This information should not be interpreted without the help of a healthcare provider. If you believe you are experiencing an interaction, contact a healthcare provider immediately. The absence of an interaction does not necessarily mean no interactions exist.

1,2-Benzodiazepine
The risk or severity of adverse effects can be increased when Morphine is combined with 1,2-Benzodiazepine.
Abaloparatide

Abemaciclib
The serum concentration of Abemaciclib can be increased when it is combined with Morphine.

### Food Interactions

Avoid alcohol. Concomitant use may lead to profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death.
Take with or without food. There is no significant different in the AUC or Cmax of oral extended release tablets when taken with or without food.

### Mechanism of action

Morphine-6-glucuronide is responsible for approximately 85% of the response observed by morphine administration.
4
Morphine and its metabolites act as agonists of the mu and kappa opioid receptors.
1
The mu-opioid receptor is integral to morphine's effects on the ventral tegmental area of the brain. Morphine's activation of the reward pathway is mediated by agonism of the delta-opioid receptor in the nucleus accumbens,
2
while modification of the respiratory system and addiction disorder are mediated by agonism of the mu-opioid receptor.

### Volume of distribution

The volume of distribution of morphine is 5.31L/kg.
6
Morphine-6-glucuronide has a volume of distribution of 3.61L/kg.
6

### Protein binding

Morphine is 35% protein bound, the metabolite morphine-3-glucuronide is 10% protein bound, and morphine-6-glucuronide is 15% protein bound.
4

### Route of elimination

70-80% of an administered dose is excreted within 48 hours.
6
Morphine is predominantly eliminated in the urine with 2-10% of a dose recovered as the unchanged parent drug.
4
7-10% of a dose of morphine is eliminated in the feces.
13

### Clearance

The apparent clearance of intravenous or subcutaneous morphine is 1600 mL/min.

### General Function

Translocates drugs and phospholipids across the membrane (PubMed:2897240, PubMed:35970996, PubMed:8898203, PubMed:9038218, PubMed:35507548). Catalyzes the flop of phospholipids from the cytoplasmic to the exoplasmic leaflet of the apical membrane. Participates mainly to the flop of phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, beta-D-glucosylceramides and sphingomyelins (PubMed:8898203). Energy-dependent efflux pump responsible for decreased drug accumulation in multidrug-resistant cells (PubMed:2897240, PubMed:35970996, PubMed:9038218)
