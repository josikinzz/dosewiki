**Fatal [overdose](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Overdose) may occur when [GABAergic substances](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GABA#GABA_receptors) are combined with other [depressants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressants) such as [opiates](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opiates) , [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) , [barbiturates](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Barbiturates) , [gabapentinoids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Gabapentinoids) , [thienodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thienodiazepines) or [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) .**
 
It is strongly discouraged to combine these substances, particularly in [common](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Common) to [heavy](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Heavy) doses.
**gamma-Butyrolactone** (also known as **γ-butyrolactone** and commonly as **GBL** ) is a synthetic [depressant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressant) substance of the [lactone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Lactone) chemical class that produces powerful [euphoric](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Euphoria) and [disinhibiting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Disinhibition) effects similar to that of alcohol intoxication. In humans it acts as a [prodrug](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Prodrug) for [GHB](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GHB) , where 1ml is equivalent to 1.66 grams of the sodium salt of GHB (Sodium oxybate). [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

GBL is a common solvent and reagent in chemistry and is also used as a flavoring, stain remover, wheel cleaner, superglue remover, paint stripper, and as a solvent in some wet aluminum electrolytic capacitors. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] It has also been found in some wine products, which suggests it may be a naturally occurring substance ( [see section below](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GBL#Natural_sources) ).

GBL, along with [1,4-butanediol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/1,4-butanediol) , are known to dissolve most types of plastic over time. For this reason, it is recommended to only transport and store the drug using a glass container, standard gelatin capsules (not vegetarian), or high-density polyethylene plastic (also known as #2 recyclable plastic). To check the type of plastic used on a bottle, one can look at the bottom for a number in the triangle shaped recycling label. GBL reacts and breaks down various forms of plastic (including plastic lids) within seconds and will float to the bottom of a container while dissolved plastic moves up. It is currently unknown how far plastic can be broken down, but there may be serious consequences when ingesting microplastics. To avoid this, do not handle GBL at any stage with ordinary plastic, for example with plastic syringes or glass bottles with an ordinary plastic cap. The liquid should be perfectly clear and colorless.

GBL has reportedly been used as date rape drug (as a legal alternative to GHB), in which it is secretly put dropwise into drinks but there is little evidence to support it being widespread, especially compared to alcohol due to its strong taste. GBL and GHB are also referred to as "K.-o.-Tropfen" (K.-o.-drops) in German-speaking countries. Care should be taken when offered drinks from strangers.

## Chemistry

GBL (gamma-butyrolactone) is a cyclic ester of *gamma* -hydroxybutanoic acid. GBL can be synthesized from GHB through dehydration of the terminal hydroxy groups, forming a saturated lactone ring. Structurally, GBL is a five-membered ring with an oxygen substituent at R 1 , adjacent from the oxygen atom in the ring, forming a cyclic ester called a lactone.

Physically, it is a hygroscopic colorless oily liquid with a weak characteristic odor and is soluble in water.

GBL has been found in extracts from samples of unadulterated wines. This finding indicates that GBL is a naturally occurring component in some wines and may be present in similar products. The concentration detected was approximately 5 μg/mL and was easily observed using a simple extraction technique followed by GC/MS analysis.

It can also be found in cheese flavorings but typically results in a content of 0.0002% GBL in the final foodstuff.

Due to its chemical similarity, GBL can easily be converted into GHB by calendistine laboratories in a one-step synthesis. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

## Pharmacology

GBL is presumably not active in its own right; its mechanism of action stems from its identity as a prodrug of [GHB](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GHB) . Hoewever, GBL may display other effects on the body, unlike GHB, but it is currently not known. It is theorized to induce a state of metabolic acidosis, a significant medical condition, especially when used for longer periods of time.

It is rapidly converted into [GHB](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GHB) by lactonase enzymes found in the blood. GBL is more lipophilic (fat soluble) than GHB, and so is absorbed faster and has higher bioavailability; paradoxically this can mean that GBL has a faster onset of effects than GHB itself, even though it is a prodrug.

The levels of lactonase enzyme can vary between individuals, meaning that first-time users can show unpredictable results, even from small doses. In many this manifests as slow onset of effects, followed by headaches, semi-consciousness which is distinct from GBL sleep in normal users. If the user decides to try again at a later date, they appear to be able to enjoy the effects normally. Because of these pharmacokinetic differences, GBL tends to be more potent and faster-acting than GHB, but has a shorter duration; whereas the related compound 1,4-butanediol (1,4-B) tends to be slightly less potent, slower to take effect but longer-acting than GHB.

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*

Reportedly, GBL is very similar to GHB. More muscle relaxing and less prone to give clonic muscle movements than GHB. Slightly longer acting, and has a more sedative feeling than GHB. May easily give gastrointestinal disturbances like nausea, diarrhoea and gas. Comment: It is not clear if ingesting butyrolactone is toxic or not. It is not cancerogenic as some sources say, but is probably not good for you. The taste is extremely disagreeable.
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)** & **[Sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation)** - At lower dosages, GBL is physically stimulating, encouraging movement and wakefulness. At higher dosages, however, it becomes physically sedating, encouraging sleep and lethargy.
- **[Respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression)** - In cases of GBL overdoses, many report experiencing an abnormal pattern of breathing characterized by progressively deeper and sometimes faster breathing, followed by a gradual decrease that results in a temporary stop in breathing called an apnea.
- **[Muscle relaxation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_relaxation)** - Muscle relaxation is reportedly more prevalent with GBL than [GHB](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GHB) and it is less prone to causing convulsions.
- **[Tactile suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_suppression)** & **[Tactile enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_enhancement)** - Both numbing as well as enhancing tactile effects can be felt coincidingly.
- **[Nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea)** - This effect is more common than with [GHB](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GHB) and may persist when GBL is used frequently.
- **[Stomach pain](/w/index.php?title=Stomach_pain&action=edit&redlink=1)** - Stomach discomfort or pain is more common with GBL than [GHB](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GHB) due to its properties as a mucous membrane irritant and/or solvent. The most effective way to reduce this is to dilute it with a large meal or drink.
- **[Stomach cramps](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stomach_cramps)**
- **[Motor control loss](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motor_control_loss)**
- **[Neurotoxicity](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurotoxicity)** - GBL is metabolized into GHB, so it may also be linked with neurotoxicity. Lower dosages have been linked with higher degrees of neurotoxicity than high doses, although this claim can be debated.
- **[Skin flushing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Skin_flushing)**
- **[Dizziness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dizziness)**
- **[Dehydration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dehydration)**
- **[Muscle cramps](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_cramps)** - Abrupt discontinuation of frequent use can also result in muscle cramps and spasms.
- **[Optical sliding](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Optical_sliding)**
- **[Increased salivation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_salivation)** - Increased salivation is very common.
- **[Increased perspiration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_perspiration)** - Cold sweats are more common than with [GHB](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GHB) .
- **[Pupil dilation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pupil_dilation)**
- **[Vasodilation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vasodilation)**
- **[Headaches](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Headaches)**
- **[Seizure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizure)** - Anecdotal reports suggests that GBL is less prone to seizures than [GHB](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GHB) . ### Visual effects
 
- - **[Visual noise](/w/index.php?title=Visual_noise&action=edit&redlink=1)** - Especially with extended use or during withdrawal, GBL greatly amplifies existing effects of visual noise for long periods of time, also including after images and tinnitus. This is presumably due to a state of excitation within the brain or metabolic acidosis. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] This is far more prevalent with GBL than [GHB](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GHB) .
- **[Visual acuity suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_acuity_suppression)**
- **[After images](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/After_images)**
- **[Perspective distortions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perspective_distortions)**
- **[Depth perception distortions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depth_perception_distortions)**
- **[Scenery slicing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenery_slicing)**
- **[Geometry](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Geometry)** - Geometry results along with visual noise, especially if the user has had experience with [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) or has [HPPD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/HPPD) ### Cognitive effects
 
- - **[Sleepiness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sleepiness)** & **[Wakefulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness)** - At very low dosages, GBL can make one tired, while common doses are primarly wakefullness-promoting. High doses can lead to feelings of being extremely sleepy.
- **[Analysis suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Analysis_suppression)**
- **[Anxiety suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety_suppression)**
- **[Disinhibition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Disinhibition)**
- **[Cognitive euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_euphoria)** - GBL is far more euphoric than [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) or [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) , more akin to [Gabapentinoids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Gabapentinoids) .
- **[Empathy, affection, and sociability enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Empathy,_affection,_and_sociability_enhancement)** - Unlike [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) which merely increases sociability through [disinhibition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Disinhibition) , GBL presents strong [entactogenic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entactogenic) effects which are prominent and well defined although weaker than that of [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) .
- **[Thought acceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_acceleration)** or **[Thought deceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_deceleration)** - Low to common doses are primarly stimulating and one finds themselves constantly generating thoughts.
- **[Memory suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Memory_suppression)** - Extended use of GBL can result in memory problems as well as forgetfulness and not being able to differentiate dreams from waking memories. 
- **[Amnesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amnesia)** - Higher doses, especially when sleeping can lead to total amnesia.
- **[Creativity enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Creativity_enhancement)** - Creativity enhancement is most apparent at low to common doses.
- **[Compulsive redosing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Compulsive_redosing)** - This is somewhat prevalent due to its short duration.
- **[Dream potentiation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dream_potentiation)** - GBL can have a very pronounced effect on dream recall and vividness. Conversely, discontinuation can result in bad dreams or nightmares. Additionally, intoxication on GBL can lead to one seeing their own dream being manifested, similar to a [wake-induced lucid dream](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/WILD) (WILD) and simultaneous states of wakefulness and dreaming.
- **[Introspection](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Introspection)**
- **[Rejuvenation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Rejuvenation)**
- **[Motivation enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motivation_enhancement)** & **[Motivation suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motivation_suppression)** - As with other coinciding effects, common doses can lead to greater motivation whilst high doses generally result in lethargy.
- **[Confusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Confusion)**
- **[Increased libido](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_libido)** - This is a very pronounced and documented effect with GHB, when compared with most other depressants.
- **[Increased music appreciation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_music_appreciation)**
- **[Spatial disorientation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spatial_disorientation)** - Disorientation is very common in dark areas.
- **[Suggestibility enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Suggestibility_enhancement)** ### Auditory effects
 
- - **[Tinnitus](/w/index.php?title=Tinnitus&action=edit&redlink=1)** - This is a distinct but significant ringing and/or buzzing in the ears which can sometimes persist for long amounts of time. It typically co-exists with visual noise during extended use or withdrawal. This is far more prevalent with GBL than [GHB](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GHB) .
- **[Auditory distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_distortion)**
### Experience reports

There are currently no anecdotal reports which describe the effects of this compound within our [experience index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Experience_index) . Additional experience reports can be found here:

## Toxicity and harm potential

GBL is not active in its own right; its mechanism of action stems from its identity as a prodrug of GHB, meaning that it is rapidly converted into GHB in the body.

GBL is not considered to be as safe as [GHB](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GHB) used responsibly or medicinally, since it is theorized to display additional toxic effects on the body, unlike GHB. The [LD50](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LD50) is above the active dosage, and there is no danger of acute toxicity. However, it can become dangerous when used as a recreational drug or abused. There have been many negative reports from recreational users who have overdosed, combined GBL with alcohol or other drugs, or accidentally dosed themselves unexpectedly or way above the common dosage range.

To avoid a possible overdose of GBL, it is important to start with a low dose and work your way up slowly by increasing the dosage in small increments. One should best use a glass bottle with an integraded 1ml pipette to exactly measure their dosages.

Accidental ingestions of GBL have also occurred due to inadequate storage methods. If GBL is put into a clear liquid, glass, or bottle, it can be easily mistaken for water. It is recommended to clearly label your GBL in writing and dye the liquid with blue food coloring so it no longer resembles a drinkable beverage. It is also recommended to store your GBL in a container that no one would drink out of.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this drug.

### Neurotoxicity

GBL itself may also produce neurotoxic effects, in addition to the effects of [GHB](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GHB) , to which it is converted to by the body.

In multiple studies, GHB has been found to impair spatial memory, working memory, learning and memory in rats with chronic administration. These effects are associated with decreased NMDA receptor expression in the cerebral cortex and possibly other areas as well.

One study found that repeated administration of GHB to rats for 15 days drastically reduced the number of neurons and non-neuronal cells within the hippocampus and in the prefrontal cortex. With once daily doses of 10 mg/kg of GHB, they were decreased by 61% in the hippocampus region and 32% in the prefrontal cortex, and with 100 mg/kg, they were decreased by 38% and 9%, respectively. This paper demonstrates contradicting effects on neuronal loss, with lower doses (10 mg/kg) producing the most neurotoxicity, and higher doses (100 mg/kg) producing less.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

GBL is possibly highly physically and moderately to highly psychologically addictive. The frequent use of GBL can cause withdrawal symptoms similar to those caused by other [depressants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressants) such as [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) and [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) if abruptly discontinued, reportedly with a much faster onset and more severe symptoms when used frequently. Withdrawal effects from GBL build faster than with GHB. These symptoms seem to depend on the dosage and the length of time the drug was used for. Light to moderate users often experience anxiety, insomnia, sleep-related problems, and tremors whereas heavy use can cause severe withdrawal symptoms like delirium, psychosis, and hallucinations, which some anecdotal reports suggesting the effects to be more severe than other depressants.

GHB, when used medicinally (two medicinal doses per day, four hours apart), creates little to no dependance while the more frequent one uses GHB, it causes exponentially more dependance and withdrawal symptoms. It is though that GBL also shares this trait, although there is no medicinal dose for GBL that is safe.

Although there have been reported fatalities due to GHB/GBL withdrawal, reports are inconclusive and further research is needed.

Tolerance will develop to the sedative-hypnotic effects within several days of continuous use. After cessation, the tolerance returns to baseline in 7 - 14 days. Withdrawal symptoms or rebound symptoms may occur after ceasing usage abruptly following a few days or longer of steady dosing, and may necessitate a gradual dose reduction to minimize neurotoxicity from withdrawal. It is proposed that GHB and especially GBL can lead to dependence at a significantly faster rate than longer-acting depressants.

GBL presents cross-tolerance with [1,4-Butanediol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/1,4-Butanediol) and [GHB](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GHB) , since GBL and 1,4-Butanediol act as [prodrugs](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Prodrug) for GHB. Cross-tolerance with other [depressants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressants) such as [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) , [phenibut](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenibut) , [baclofen](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Baclofen) and other GABA B -agonists is likely.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **Nitrous** - Both substances cause ataxia and bring a risk of vomiting and unconsciousness. If the patient falls unconscious while under the influence there is a severe risk of vomit aspiration if they are not placed in the recovery position. Memory blackouts are likely.
- **Amphetamines** - Stimulants increase respiration rate allowing a higher dose of sedatives. If the stimulant wears off first then the sedative may overcome the patient and cause respiratory arrest.
- **MDMA** - Large amounts of GHB/GBL may overwhelm the effects of MDMA on the comedown.
- **Cocaine** - Stimulants increase respiration rate allowing a higher dose of sedatives. If the stimulant wears off first then the sedative may overcome the patient and cause respiratory arrest.
- **Ketamine** - Both substances cause ataxia and bring a risk of vomiting and unconsciousness. If the patient falls unconscious while under the influence there is a severe risk of vomit aspiration if they are not placed in the recovery position.
- **MXE** - Both substances cause ataxia and bring a risk of vomiting and unconsciousness. If the patient falls unconscious while under the influence there is a severe risk of vomit aspiration if they are not placed in the recovery position.
- **DXM** - Both substances cause ataxia and bring a risk of vomiting and unconsciousness. If the patient falls unconscious while under the influence there is a severe risk of vomit aspiration if they are not placed in the recovery position. This combination is hard to predict.
- **PCP** - Details of this combination are not well understood but PCP generally interacts in an unpredictable manner.
- **Alcohol** - Even in very low doses this combination rapidly leads to memory loss, severe ataxia and unconsciousness. There is a high risk of vomit aspiration while unconscious.
- **Opioids** - The two substances potentiate each other strongly and unpredictably, very rapidly leading to unconsciousness. While unconscious, vomit aspiration is a risk if not placed in the recovery position.
- **Tramadol** - The sedative effects of this combination can lead to dangerous respiratory depression.
- **Benzodiazepines** - The two substances potentiate each other strongly and unpredictably, very rapidly leading to unconsciousness. While unconscious, vomit aspiration is a risk if not placed in the recovery position.

## Legal status

- **Australia:** GBL is a border controlled substance and is illegal to import into Australia without a permit. The importation of a commercial quantity of a border controlled drug (over 1 kg of GBL) is punishable by up to life imprisonment and/or an \$825,000 fine.
- **Austria:** Since January 1, 2012, GBL is illegal to possess, produce and sell under the NPSG (Neue-Psychoaktive-Substanzen-Gesetz Österreich). [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **Canada:** GBL is a Controlled Substance under Schedule VI of the "Controlled Drugs and Substances Act" in Canada. Schedule VI of the "Controlled Drugs and Substances Act" requires vendors to collect information regarding purchases of GBL. The Act also prohibits the import and export of GBL into or out of Canada classifying it as either an indictable offence punishable with up to 10 years in prison or an offence punishable on summary conviction liable to imprisonment for up to eighteen months. It is not illegal for an individual to possess GBL in Canada.
- **Germany:** GBL is not listed in the narcotics law, but its distribution is controlled. Possession is not illegal, but may be punished according to the Medicines Act, when intended to be sold for human consumption or synthesis of GHB. In recent years, an increase of GBL consumption has been observed due to the prohibition of GHB. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **Hong Kong:** GBL is a dangerous drug controlled under Schedule 1 of the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, Cap.134 (with exemption clause at Paragraph 16D). Any person who is found to have in his possession of it not in accordance with this Ordinance can be liable, on conviction upon indictment, a fine of HK\$1,000,000 and to imprisonment for 7 years. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **Israel:** GBL was classified as a proscribed substance from 2007.
- **Netherlands** : GBL can be freely bought as a cleaning agent. Retailers do not need a licence to sell the substance.
- **Poland:** GBL is classified as a drug and handling it requires a pharmaceutical license.
- **Sweden:** GBL is not classified as a drug but as a health-endangering substance. Although recently passed legislation to enter into force on 1 April 2011 will make it possible to handle narcotics for industrial purposes will enable GBL and 1,4-Butanediol to be classified as controlled substances.
- **Switzerland:** GBL is considered an ester analog of GHB, which would make it illegal according to Buchstabe B. Industrial use however is permitted.
- **Turkey:** GBL is a classed as drug and is illegal to possess, produce, supply, or import.
- **United Kingdom:** Because of their legitimate uses, regulation 4B of the 2001 regulations makes it lawful to import, export, produce, supply, offer to supply or possess GBL and [1,4-BD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/1,4-Butanediol) . Except where a person does so knowing or believing that they will be used for the purpose of human ingestion.
- **United States:** GBL is regulated as a List 1 controlled chemical. As a GHB analog, it is treated as a controlled substance under Schedule I of the "Controlled Substances Act" if intended for human consumption.

## Effects
The effect is extremely dose-dependent and varies greatly from individual to individual. It also depends on the purity of the substance. The spectrum of effects ranges from euphoria, relaxation, disinhibition, intensification of perception, urge to talk (babble flash), slight dizziness and drowsiness to deep (coma-like) sleep or unconsciousness.

## Dosage
The dosage depends on the degree of dilution and is even more delicate with GBL than with GHB, as not every body converts GBL into GHB at the same rate and in the same amount. GBL is a strong acid that can corrode the mucous membranes and must be heavily diluted with a non-alcoholic drink before drinking! In case of doubt: less is more!

## Risks

### Short-term Risks
The higher the dose, the more likely nausea, vomiting and dizziness will occur. Headaches, confusion, breathing difficulties, cardiac arrhythmias, impaired balance and memory can occur at very high doses, as can uncontrollable muscle twitching, which is easily mistaken for epilepsy but can also progress into epilepsy.
The danger of an unintentional overdose is very high with GBL - even if it is not mixed! Signs of a GBL overdose are severe drowsiness followed by several hours of deep sleep that cannot be disturbed or can only be disturbed with difficulty (sometimes interrupted by short periods of wakefulness = standing man symptom), mild to very severe nausea, nausea, dizziness, headache, muscle atrophy (barely able to stay on one's feet) up to complete immobility, unconsciousness, disappearance of reflexes and breathing difficulties. It is difficult to assess whether users are only in a deep sleep or already in a coma after GBL use - if in doubt, always seek medical help!

### Long-term Risks
Regular use of GBL can lead to sleep disorders, anxiety and tremors; there is a risk of dependence with psychological and physical symptoms. In the case of chronic high-dose consumption (several doses daily), severe physical withdrawal symptoms such as sweating, muscle cramps or epileptic seizures occur upon discontinuation.

## Safer Use
- If you are offered GBL, ask about the origin of the substance and the dosage.
- GBL should be dosed lower than GHB! To produce the same effect, you need about half as much GBL as GHB.
- Dose carefully! If GBL does not (yet) work, it is best to wait 2 hours and not add more right away. Often, overdosing is caused by adding more. Use an insulin syringe or graduated pipettes so that you can measure your unit of consumption accurately. Make a note of when you took your last dose.
- Refrain from using GBL when you are alone.
- With GBL, refrain from mixed consumption of any kind, especially with alcohol! Dilute the liquid before consumption, e.g. with tea.
- If you have sex on GBL, follow the safe sex rules. Have condoms etc. ready before consumption.
- People with epilepsy, heart or kidney dysfunction should not consume GBL under any circumstances!
- GBL withdrawal should only be carried out under medical supervision.
- Never leave your drink unattended to avoid someone mixing GBL into your drink. If your drink tastes strange, pour it out for your own safety.

  "wikipedia": `# Γ-Butyrolactone
*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%93-Butyrolactone*

γ-Butyrolactone (GBL) or gamma-butyrolactone is an organic compound with the formula O=CO(CH2)3. It is a hygroscopic, colorless, water-miscible liquid with a pleasant odor. It is the simplest 4-carbon lactone. It is mainly used as an intermediate in the production of other chemicals, such as N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone.
In humans, GBL acts as a prodrug for gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) and is often used as a recreational drug. GHB acts as a central nervous system (CNS) depressant with effects similar to those of barbiturates.

## Occurrence

GBL has been found in extracts from samples of unadulterated wines. This finding indicates that GBL is a naturally occurring component in some wines and may be present in similar products. The concentration detected was approximately 5 μg/mL and was easily observed using a simple extraction technique followed by GC/MS analysis. GBL can be found in cheese flavorings but typically results in a content of 0.0002% GBL in the final foodstuff.

## Production and synthesis

γ-Butyrolactone is produced industrially by dehydrogenation of 1,4-butanediol at a temperature of 180–300 °C and atmospheric pressure in the presence of a copper catalyst.

The yield of this process is approximately 95%. The purification takes place with a liquid-gas-phase extraction.
In the laboratory, it may also be obtained via the oxidation of tetrahydrofuran (THF), for example with aqueous sodium bromate. An alternative route proceeds from GABA via a diazonium intermediate.

## Reactions

As a lactone, GBL is hydrolyzed under basic conditions, for example in a sodium hydroxide solution into sodium gamma-hydroxybutyrate, the sodium salt of gamma-hydroxybutyric acid. In acidic water, a mixture of the lactone and acid forms exists in an equilibrium. These compounds then may go on to form the polymer poly(4-hydroxybutyrate) as well as the dimer 1,6-Dioxecane-2,7-dione. When treated with a non-nucleophilic base, such as lithium diisopropylamide, GBL undergoes deprotonation of the alpha carbon atom to the carbonyl.

### Polymerization

The ring-opening polymerization of butyrolactone gives polybutyrolactone. The resulting reverts to the monomer by thermal cracking. It is claimed that poly(GBL) is competitive with commercial biomaterial poly(4-hydroxybutyrate), or P4HB. It is further claimed that poly(GBL) is cheaper to make than P4HB, although both are bio-derived.

## Uses

Gamma-Butyrolactone is used as a chemical solvent and a cleaning agent, for example in paint stripping or for cleaning graffiti.
Butyrolactone is a precursor to other chemicals. Reaction with methylamine gives NMP, and with ammonia gives pyrrolidone. It is also used as a solvent in lotions and some polymers.

Butyrolactone, with its wide liquid range, chemical stability, and high dielectric constant, is used in electrolytic capacitors as the organic solvent.
It has been used as a solvent in various laboratory experiments, e.g., the preparation of methylammonium lead halide.
Another discovered GBL utility is in the synthesis of nicotine (analogs).

## Pharmacology

GBL is not active in its own right; its mechanism of action stems from its identity as a prodrug of GHB.

### Pharmacokinetics

GBL is rapidly converted into GHB by paraoxonase (lactonase) enzymes, found in the blood. Animals which lack these enzymes exhibit no effect from GBL. GBL is more lipophilic (fat soluble) than GHB, and so is absorbed faster and has higher bioavailability. Because of these pharmacokinetic differences, GBL tends to be more potent and faster-acting than GHB, but has a shorter duration; whereas the related compound 1,4-butanediol (1,4-B) tends to be slightly less potent and slower to take effect but longer-acting than GHB.

### Nutritional supplement

Due to its property of being a prodrug of GHB which increases sleep related growth hormone (GH) secretion, GBL was sold as a nutritional supplement after the scheduling of GHB, under the names Revivarant and Renewtrient, until they were banned by the FDA.

### Recreational drug

GBL is a prodrug of GHB (naturally produced) and its recreational use comes entirely as a result of this. GBL overdose can cause irrational behavior, severe sickness, coma and death.
To bypass GHB restriction laws, home synthesis kits were introduced to transform GBL and/or 1,4-B into GHB.

GBL has a distinctive taste and odor, described as being comparable to stale water, synthetic melon aroma or burnt plastic. This differs significantly from GHB, which is described as having a decidedly "salty" taste.
Due to the fact that those with limited chemistry knowledge can make GBL with easy-to-get precursors, it has become quite popular among young people in French nightclubs. Like its metabolite GHB, it can also be used as a date-rape drug.

#### Dangers

If taken undiluted by mouth, GBL can cause esophageal and gastro-intestinal irritation. It is possible for oral ingestion of GBL to cause nausea and other similar problems, possibly more so than with GHB.
GHB has biphasic effects, a euphoric effect at low doses (the reason for the term liquid ecstasy), and a sedative effect at higher doses. As a result of this sedation it can cause unconsciousness. When combined with alcohol the increased sedation and risk of vomiting results in a high risk of fatality. As a result, many harm reduction organizations suggest never mixing the two drugs.
There have been several news reports of deaths associated with GBL, usually in combination with alcohol or other depressants.

#### Addictiveness and dependence

Frequent use of GHB or GBL, even when taken long-term and in moderate doses, does not appear to cause significant physical dependency in the majority of its users. In many people, quitting or temporarily abstaining from use of the drugs is achieved with minimal or no difficulty. However, when consumed in excessive amounts with a high frequency of dosing, physical and psychological dependence can develop. Management of GBL dependence involves considering the person's age, comorbidity and the pharmacological pathways of GBL.
GHB and GBL users can adopt a '24/7' dosing regime. This is where the user has become tolerant to the effects of the drug, increasing the dosage and frequency of dosage simply to avoid withdrawal symptoms.
For those users who do report withdrawal symptoms upon quitting the use of GHB or GBL, symptoms seem to depend on the dosage and the length of time the drug was used. Light to moderate users often experience insomnia and sleep-related problems, whereas heavy, prolonged use can cause severe withdrawal symptoms similar to Benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome (BWS).

#### Dose

A milliliter of pure GBL metabolizes to the equivalent 1.65 g of NaGHB, the common form, so doses are measured in the single milliliter range, either taken all at once or sipped over the course of a night.

### Legal status

Australia: GBL is not classified as a drug but as a health-endangering substance. Legislation entering into force on 1 April 2011 made it possible to handle narcotics for industrial purposes and enabled GBL and 1,4-Butanediol to be classified as controlled substances. As of 2025 there are penalties for possessing, selling or driving under the influence of the substance, but can be handled with a permit.
Canada: GBL is a Controlled Substance under Schedule VI of the "Controlled Drugs and Substances Act" in Canada. Schedule VI of the "Controlled Drugs and Substances Act" requires vendors to collect information regarding purchases of GBL. The Act also prohibits the import and export of GBL into or out of Canada classifying it as either an indictable offense punishable with up to 10 years in prison or an offense punishable on summary conviction liable to imprisonment for up to eighteen months. 
Germany: GBL is not listed in the narcotics law, but its distribution is controlled. Possession is not illegal, but may be punished according to the Medicines Act, when intended to be sold for human consumption or synthesis of GHB. In recent years, an increase of GBL consumption has been observed due to the prohibition of GHB.
Hong Kong SAR: GBL is a dangerous drug controlled under Schedule 1 of the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, Cap.134 (with exemption clause at Paragraph 16D). Any person who is found to have in his possession of it not in accordance with this Ordinance can be liable, on conviction upon indictment, a fine of HK\$1,000,000 and to imprisonment for 7 years.
Israel: GBL was classified as a proscribed substance from 2007.
Netherlands: GBL is unlike GHB not listed in the narcotics law, but its distribution is controlled. Possession is not illegal but may be punished according to the Medicines Act, when intended to be sold for human consumption or synthesis of GHB.
People's Republic of China: GBL was regulated as a Class III drug precursor since 7 June 2021.
Poland: GBL is classified as a drug. A license is mandatory for the manufacture, processing, reworking, importing, distribution of GBL.
Russia: GBL has been classified as a psychotropic substance since 22 February 2012. Its trafficking is limited, and non-licensed selling, buying or any other use is punishable by imprisonment up to 20 years.
Sweden: GBL is not classified as a drug but as a health-endangering substance. Although recently passed legislation to enter into force on 1 April 2011 will make it possible to handle narcotics for industrial purposes will enable GBL and 1,4-Butanediol to be classified as controlled substances.
United Kingdom: Because of their legitimate uses, regulation 4B of the 2001 regulations makes it lawful to import, export, produce, supply, offer to supply or possess GBL and 1,4-BD, except where a person does so knowing or believing that they will be used for the purpose of human ingestion. Otherwise it is a class B controlled substance.
United States: GBL is regulated as a List I controlled chemical. As a GHB analog, it is also treated as a controlled substance under Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act if intended for human consumption. Sales and distribution of this product for industrial use is tightly regulated and requires quantity tracing, lock and key storage and 24 hour surveillance and is limited to a very few suppliers who have appropriate DEA registrations and as of 2021 included only Ashland, BASF, and Miami Chemical. Lyondell reportedly stopped commercial sales of this product due to increasingly tight regulations and liabilities but still makes it for internal and downstream production use. To purchase this chemical requires special DEA license and end use certificate approved and a site audit by DEA.
