What is the experience any of you have with this compared to K?

It probably lasts longer, is more potent, and would be likely more bioavailiable by eating/rectal use

Yo.


[My trip report](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/636582-%28N-ethylnorketamine%29-Above-methoxetamine-means-godlike-for-me).


I don't compare to regular K, but that's what I ever expected K to be like.

I already had the opportunity to test a 200 mg sample. for safety reasons, I slowly worked my dosage up over several hours, that's why I didn't reach a hole (I'm also quite a hard-head when it comes to dissociatives, unfortunately). the effects very similar to ketamine in quality. it is more potent per weight than racemic ketamine, I would estimate by a factor of 1.5, comparable to s-ketamine, but surprisingly, the duration was not increased. all in all, this compound seems very promising to me and I'm looking forward to try it again in higher doses, I assume that 150mg consumed at once will give me a nice hole experience. people with less tolerance than me should start much lower, obviously.

have a sample on its way just would be good to get info from people who have experianced it and how it compares to ket and mxe as well as dosages always best to get clued up and walk with a new element before dancing with it ![:-)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) thanks for your input ungelesene![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

**N-ethyl-ketamine first time.**


Substance: N-ethyl-ketamine combined with Ethylphenidate and Methiopropamine

ROA: Intravenous

161 Lbs, 5" 11' male

Dissociative experience: Used ketamine for a couple of months about 8 years ago.  Didn't like the K hole.


I received .5g of N-ethyl-ketamine earlier and am now in the process of sampling it.  This report is going to be a bit subjective as I am already on Ethylphenidate and Methiopropamine.  I had 2 doses of Ethylphenidate earlier in the day.


**0:00** 60mg Ethylphenidate IV.


**1:00** 35mg Methiopropamine IV.


**2:25** 12mg N-ethyl-ketamine IV.


**2:53** Very mild effects.  Am typing this up with no difficulty.


**3:15** 24mg N-ethyl-ketamine IV.


**3:28** Make a cup of tea.  Text looks very slightly blurred but I can still type OK.  Feel very lethargic though I felt a bit that way before I started.  Don't feel much different to what I did after the the first dose.


**3:50** weigh up 47mg N-EK on scales.  Requires a little more effort than usual.


**4:14** 47mg N-ethyl-ketamine IV. Took me ages to find a vein.  Stabbed myself many times with many needles before I finally registered.  It's coming on strong as I type.


**4:29** Definitely feeling it now. MY thought processes are much slower and tasks require much more effort.  Typing not too difficult but I'm having to correct a lot of spelling mistakes.


**4:50** Weighed out 49mg. Am functioning OK.


**4:59** 49mg N-ethyl-ketamine IV.  Coming on strong buzzing in ears.


**5:17** Feel myself going into a hole. Lost it for 10 minutes or so and had to lay down.  Lost the ability to think for a bit.  Feel really spaced out.


**5:34** Am functioning but every thing's an effort.


**5:38** Weigh out 21mg. Feel slight sensation of nausea.


**6:07** 21mg N-ethyl-ketamine IV.  Finding a vein's hard work again.  The dose isn't enough to have any great effect on me.  Give up and go to bed.

Hey man, if you really want to contribute some useful information to this thread, perhaps try a larger dose insufflated without stims active in your system.


Cause that's the way most people are likely to experiment with it. IV is a fairly rare route of administration for ketamine-type things.


Either way whatever info you've got is appreciated.

I did ketamine some years ago and loved the sort of hallucinations you get on pre hole doses without losing the ability to reason.  The K hole I hated.  I have chosen to IV N-EK purely because of the minimum duration so if I end up somewhere I don't want to be, I will be there for the shortest possible time.  As it happens I didn't really get any hallucinations before going into the hole on N-EK but maybe fine tuning the dose will sort that out.  I only have a half g and from what I've seen so far probably won't be replacing it but who knows.


EDIT - and I used to like combining K with amphetamines so the concept of combining K type drugs with stims is not alien to me.


EDIT - I forgot to mention that this produced no visual activity for me whatsoever, just dissociation.

The Hole is a state that is near loss of consciousness.  Losds of consciousness isnt voluntary with rnough ketamine like substances, but if you are almost there you can be aroused away from the vicinity of loss of consciousness.  At the ER they slap your face for this and encourage you urgently to be responsive.  If you take stimulants with these drugs, obviously you will get more messed up but it will be harder to hole because its harder to let go and drift away when you're buzzing on stims.

It's the same stuff they're selling - n-ethyl-ketamine and just ethylketamine. Looks like this:


![XncZY.png](https://www.bluelight.org/community/proxy.php?image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2FXncZY.png&hash=1341d039932bf948f5ea47e6519b7db8)


I've seen the above image used for both names, some with the H3C removed, but no matter, same stuff. I'm led to believe n-ethylnorketamine is technically wrong, name-wise. My ( very limited ) understanding is that the *'nor'* indicates the methyl group has been removed; that's already made explicit with the ethyl in the name.


Two brief reports elsewhere on UK sourced stuff just this week come available suggests almost indistinguishable from Ketamine, oral / insufflated dose range very similar. Take that with a *LARGE* pinch of salt but certainly enough to spark my interest. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

actually not that explicit strictly speaking, but under friends, this is enough to make clear what one is talking about; for a more comprehensive answer, see [this post by Transformer](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/594944-The-Big-amp-Dandy-2-MeO-Ketamine-Thread?p=10888356&viewfull=1#post10888356).

Ah, right. Missed that thread. Almost the exact opposite of what I said then. ![:?](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/confused.gif) Cheers for the clarification. I have been grossly misinformed by someone claiming to understand these things but even so thought I'd double-checked that enough. 8)  ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

Tried this today, quick trip report:


T -0:30 - Insufflate ~1mg and place another ~1mg on my tongue as an allergy test.


T+0:00 - Insufflate 30mg, crushed the powder as fine as possible and it made a couple of quite hefty lines - it's considerably less dense than MXE.


T:0:05 - Already coming up, it hits alot faster than MXE, powder has blocked my nose badly and I've sneezed several times.


T:0.15 - Effects have peaked, mild dissociation but definitely euphoric. Feels a lot like 3-MeO-PCE and the exact opposite of 3-MeO-PCP (emotionless and zombie like imo).


T:0:45 - Effects starting to wear down.


T:0:60 - Pretty much baseline.


T:1:15 - Decide to plug 70mg. Dissolved in 2mg of water with some stirring. 


T:1:20 - Feeling very little, could well be down to placebo. Plugging has always been my favourite RoA with MXE so it's a shame it doesn't work, but it's what I was expected.


T:1:30 - Insufflate 50mg. Struggle to get it all up my nose, sneeze a lot.


T:1:45 - Peaked again, feels stronger than the 30mg so short term tolerance isn't too much of an issue. Physically more messy than MXE, much more of a drunk body high considering the level of dissociation, but mentally felt more lucid. Eyes open no visuals at all, but with them closed all the standard sensations of moving, turning, tunnels etc are felt, albeit mildly. 


T:2:45 - Back to baseline again.


I like N-Ethyl-Ketamine. Effects last roughly 45 minutes and are gone within an hour (at doses of 30mg and 50mg). Main issues are that it really blocks my nose, even 4 hours later it still doesn't feel clear. IM would be the way to go with this but needles are a line that I don't want to cross. Next time I'll probably try around 100mg at once as with the right dose I think a hole would be definitely achievable.


Tl;dr - Blocks nose, lasts 1 hour, plugging doesn't work. Will do it again.

Anyone tried this that is well experienced with ketamine? The fast onset and nose thing is common to me, except it's more of like the feeling of an allergic reaction, lots of sneezing etc. Looking promising. :D

I've just recieved a 250mg sample. Had smoked a couple testers of nice hash aswell so hopefully that won't effect things much;


First impressions were it looks good, crunches with the card, it's a fine hard crystally powder. 


10.15 am: Sniffed 30mgs, it has a fairly ketty taste about it.


Listening to this, can definately feel something other than the hashhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwS1OKPZpI0


Decided to sniff another 30mg in hope for more of this, it definately tastes very ketty but it feels harder on the nose. Made me sneeze.


The drip is so similar to ketamine yet nastier concidering the size of the line. Music sounds good. My skin feels like it's on ketamine.


Pretty impressed at this stage, it feels like nice clean friendly ket. I reckon the doses required aren't far off though. Got 150-170mg left. Caught myself staring into space, probably a combination of the hash aswell.


Can feel that HD vision effect I get from good ketamine is present. 


Chatting to a mate got this [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJchGizKtX4b](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJchGizKtX4b) blasting out loud, some good euphoria.


This stuff would be good club material, bouncy, eyes look like i've been on ketamine.


The drip and nose block is bad.


Aiming for the hole just sniffed 160mg ish, got the crazy lights on blinds shut. Switched from tunes to Gonzo - the life and times of Hunter S.


No joy with the hole, bailed on the film. Smoked another lung.


This stuff is good but no K-hole material. Maybe if I'd had 250mg would have done it.


The drip is bad on the throat with larger doses.


I'll probably try it again but think I'd need a gram for a decent bash at the stuff. It is a euphoric feeling dissociative, nice headspace and the tunes sound brilliant.

I'd like to read some trip reports from people who are ketamine connoisseurs - most reports I have seen compare it to MXE. Also be nice to have the reports written by people who don't have massive dissociative tolerance too! ![:p](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)

Also received a 250mg bag of this today, managed to snap it up off a trusted UK vendor before it sold out the other day (it went fast). I'm guessing its the same one as rockstar. I'm also going to go for around the same dose. Will report back.

7zark I'm a big K fan, read EADD's last regional K discussion, I know my shit. This NEK was cleaner and more friendly than the last shitty racemic pakistani ket I had which was just confusing and not very visual. I've had K that was better than this NEK but not for a while. I would like to try it at hole doses, which I estimate would be 250mg for me, it almost tastes quite nice when you crush it up to perfection, but the drip is natty.


I think the hash I smoked is that strong that it might have effected my NEK trip towards the end, almost overpowered it. 


There's a not bad afterglow aswell. Best RC since drone.

Cheers Rockstar, reckon it's worth giving a shot while k is still a bit shite over here at the moment? Really positive stuff so far starting to really wanna try this. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Done 60mgs total. The taste is quite bad - Put a bit in my mouth to get the flavor. The usual hairspray esque taste from like 5mgs, does taste different to mxe more like 3-meo-pcp. Its a fairly coarse white powder, took a fair bit of crushing. I'm noticing slight visuals, in the way the light bounces round as clouds pass over. Feel quite relaxed and mood has lifted quite a bit, music sounds great and I have that slight excited euphoric feeling in my gut. It does feel quite natural and friendly like rockstar said - I've never had any good ket before so I can't really compare, but from my limited experience it feels similar - Its deffo better than MXE already, feels more natural and floaty. Its really peaceful stuff this, I have a feeling its going to be a hit this one. (Written at 40 mins in)


Edit: Just to clarify, snorted it in 2x 30mg lines 15 minutes apart, 65mgs in the system in total.

Male, early thirties, 90kg/14st 3lb (200lb). Experienced with ketamine and MXE (insufflated and IM) at full dissociative doses. Much prefer K to MXE due to psychological and physical after effects of high dose MXE (feeling distraught and uneasy the next day), whereas K is much more exuberant and forgiving of excess. No cross tolerance or other drugs in system at time of trial.


Received 500mg N-EK (2-(2-chlorophenyl)-N-(ethylamino)cyclohexanone) from reputable supplier...


30mg insufflated to test. Drip unremarkable. Feels clean and like a low dose of ketamine.


470mg dissolved cleanly in approximately 7.5ml water to produce ~6.3% solution and passed through 0.2micron syringe filter to sterilise. Considered saline but unconcerned for such a small volume, and with special salt! 


Intramuscular (IM) injection of 1.5ml N-EK solution (just under 100mg) into deltoid muscle with 1 inch 21g syringe. Lay down with eyes closed anticipating hole, Blanck Mass playing on speakers. Mild confusion/relaxation/euphoria/lucidity but did not hole. Could feel small amount of ketamine-like squeezing, shifting, rollercoaster effects and minor increased visualisation in minds eye (main sought after effect and indicator of K-hole in previous experience). No dissociation to the point of forgetting who I was. Familiar post-anaesthesia nausea present but not troubling at half hour mark. Baseline in 1 hour, wouldn't consider driving just yet though.


In summary, a pleasant but uneventful experience. Material was clean and of seemingly high quality. Based on understanding of the compounds chemistry, as discussed on Bluelight and elsewhere, I was expecting the N-EK to be slightly stronger than K, hence the flat 100mg dose. Is it possible that the first batch might somehow not be of full potency? I understand SAR is a dark art and proof is really in the pudding... Will try again with 150mg another day. To those that follow, I would say treat exactly as K (unknown side effects aside ~ disclaimer).

Yeah no doubt it's better than MXE, and SpecialK i'd say give it a try anyway mate, it's different to ket feels cleaner and more functional. I think I'd need more than I had altogether to try it properly maybe .5 or more like a g and we'll see what it's all about. I didnt hole off 150-170mg last line but then it takes .3 of decent ketamine so i dont think its that much more potent than k, not that much anyway, 70-90mg sniffed before it was doing anything for me.


It definately works sniffed. Also i have my doubts about oral dosing doing a lot, k certainly doesnt work bombed even at stupid doses. I'd stick to sniffing for now.

You wouldnt ever expect to hole on 100mg IM of actual ketamine though would you? I cant hole off 200mg IM ketamax brand. As I said 250mg line will be the teller. Wouldnt be so keen on IM'ing RC's or anything that's not from a vial.


Someone who's got a sample just start with a decent hole size line and let us know what the hole is like? ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

But obviously its not recommended to consume research chemicals at all, regardless of ROA. IM is optimal for K, so I expect a few people at least will appreciate such a report. 


It's pretty easy to chart the future of N-EK. Once a few more reports are in and an appropriate dose has been established through the fog, it will be/is, temporarily, like good K is easily obtainable. A LOT will be sold. The price may go up with demand but eventually drop to ~£20/g as more vendors offer it (and particularly if the dose is much higher than K). The quality from some of those vendors will also decrease with price, and someone will get hurt on something semi-bunk. How long does it take to pass "emergency" legislation? After which it won't be marketable or legal to own. So stock up, but only enough for yourselves!

I give it 6 months max before it's Class B. Ketamine and its analogues are already subject to a Home Office ordered review by the ACMD. This will almost certainly be included specifically, or will be caught with a broad enough definition of what constitutes a Ket analogue. On the plus side I can't see the Home Office bothering with a Temp Class Drug Order specifically for this any sooner than that which they might otherwise have done now they've had the practice with MXE.

If your part of the functional wonk brigade you'll probably like this. The only thing is it's less visual and less physically wonky than quality K is. It's a cleaner more functional version of ketamine, I'd still rather proper K myself it's just not as easy to get proper fun shards anymore.


I want to try it at higher doses see if/what the hole is like, I can imagine there must be one at the right dose. Not convinced it is any stronger than K mg for mg, maybe a wee bit.

I've .5 of this coming in a day or so, can't wait. I was a big fan of MXE, having never tried K, i rushed to get this as i've always wanted to try proper K. So what dosage should a first timer try? 60mg up the nose or lower?

the duration of n-ethyl-ketamine is short, just like with ordinary ketamine. it seems both compounds are rapidly broken down in the body, so my educated guess is that oral N-ethyl-ketamine is orally inefficient, just like oral ketamine. but of course this is just theory; someone needs to try it and report.

Decided to insufflate 100mg of this compound just an hour or so ago, I have a moderate tolerance to methoxetamine in that I need to take around 90mg naslly to acheive any sort of visual state with it however for some reason 130mg of ket still makes me hole, are they not cross tolerant?


I'm Pretty experienced with dissasociatives, have tried DXM, 3-MeO-PCP, 3-MeO-PCE, 3-MeO-PCPr + 3-MeO-PCPy, ketamine, methoxetamine and I even think possibly tiletamine one time I had some dodgy k.


Anyway this ethylketamine tastes very similar to k when it goes up but does burn alot more tho and made me sneeze and have to blow my nose alot.

It came on very smoothly and reminded me of ketamine in a lot of ways, however there was not so much of a trip coming on and certainly not near a hole, felt great for about an hour, music was enjoyable and I just felt really good, my motor skills were 'wonky' but certainly a lot less immobilising than I find ketamine to be. 


Despite the positive experience I was a bit dissatisfied as I tend to take dissasociatives for the psychedelic side so i considered a redose but instead smoked some hash through a bong. 2 minutes after this and im in a headspace I have never quite been in before it was very visual full of complex shapes and figures, hallucinations being in a corridor with people taking off their hats and bending them into cars with vibrating toothbrushes for drivers. 

The entity contact which I experience on other dissasociatives is also present, at times it became pretty intense but only when you sort of zone into that 'trance state' does the intensity seem to increase, I was amazed at the fact that one minute lying down I was in another dimension but could just get up and walk about and function fairly normally. 


This one seems to so far be living to up to the hype feels amazingly clean and euphoric my only complaint is the damage to my nose, I have only sniffed 100mg and its fucked, completely blocked up and im having to blow it every 2 mins cos its leaking lol,, i'll update with further trials when they occur It should also be noted that 200mg of modafinil was consumed 9 hours before this compound so it may have had an effect on the experience. I feel very comfortable with my first trial of this substance and will probably be upping the dose to 150mg next time. Happy days =]

Oral assay are needed, would be great if oral dosage is an efficient route.

Tried the remaining 75mg insufflated today (should have been 100mg but seems it was under-weighed ).


Tolerance had built up significantly after doing it yesterday; it kicked in hard for about 15 minutes but died within half an hour or taking it and in under 45 minutes I was completely back to baseline.


From what I've seen this doesn't appear to much more potent than ket, and I'd hazard a guess that the dosages for this will match up with erowid's chart for ketamine dosages. I can see it becoming **very** popular in the UK once the price drops to 20 quid a gram or lower. Short acting, weak enough for the meph head's to do massive lines and generally a bit easier going than MXE means this will be big.

Seeing as it doesn't work at all (or very poorly) plugged I'd highly doubt that oral will be a viable route. Just speculation though.

All dissociative SAR would indicate that this should be more potent than Ketamine. Perhaps what's happening here is that the samples are impure by a significant amount and the remaining impurity accounts for the nose damage people are reporting as well as diminished potency.

Not really actually. Think 3-meo-pcp vs 3-meo-pce potency. 3-meo-pcp is by far the most potent of these two.

Comparing the potency 3-meo-pcp to 3-meo-pce isnt the same as comparing the potency of ketamine to n-ethyl-norketamine. In the fist scenario you're comparing a piperadine ring to an n-ethyl group were as in the second scenario you are comparing the potency of a n-methyl to n-ethyl group. I would think a more valid comparison would be the potency of PCM to PCE, in which PCE is more potent (from what i've read anyway). This would indicate the n-ethyl-norketamine should be more potent than ketamine, but who knows.

How much did you take? Most interesting thing I've read on this yet.


To be honest my thoughts are it's not worth £35 a gram, I did like it and I will have another go but it's not going to entice many of the K heads at those prices. I had some indian ketamine today and it is more enjoyable than NEK, I'd basically compare NEK to 7/10 quality ket.


I am still very interested to hear of stories about the hole.


And what's with the no afterglow thing? I had one for about an hour then it just vanished.

^ I don't think it's that unusual to hear that THC massively boosts the effects of Nek, since it's the same with MXE/3-MeO-PCP/E.


Did some MXE on Monday and had some oral THC yesterday, which was so unbelievable intense that i almost suffered a panic attack as it brought the MXE effects back almost completey. I was so high, completely out of it, i'm still puzzled how strong it was...


Had the same one time with mushrooms, when i ate some Butter the day after consuming a low dose of shrooms...the THC was even stronger the day after than the shrooms itself.


It's nice, but i'm interested to hear about Nek on it's own... For me it seemed pretty weak, i even go that far to say it was like too less MXE, hence nothing special.

Seems like everyone's disappointed with it so far![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)


Although i remember when MXE was brand new to the RC world the first few reports i read were also disappointed with it, so i don't think we should lose all hope in this stuff yet![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


Maybe all these new trip reports coming in already have a severe cross tolerance with MXE use?

I was "clean" for a few weeks so no, i had no tolerance to MXE etc.


Only thing was, that i plugged almost half of the sample i've got and this didn't work. And it wasn't that bad, it just felt not very unique/special, but it could also be me. I also don't feel much difference between various opioids regarding their effects, so it could probably be the same with this class of chemicals?

There is absolutely no psychedelia from NEK in my experience. The euphoria is there but it just doesn't have any of the downer/dissociative effects. It really blocks my nose too.

What are the effects like oral? I found sniffing it worked just fine, it's pretty clear we've all mostly got from the same place as theres only 2 legit NEK vendors selling it.


Although I can get ketamine just now I might buy a gram at the weekend just to see what it is like orally and at higher doses. The lack of psychadelic effect and afterglow is making it seem not worthwhile when ketamine is about though, that said it did take me to a nice euphoric happy kind of headspace, it's just a shame it's a bit lacking in any visual ketamine effect and nobody has reported of any fun hole type experiances yet, that combined with the price doesnt really make it seem worthwhile vs good old fashioned ketaminezz.


Still enjoyed it. However I'm riding a very nice ketamine afterglow right now and the k today was definately more fun and bang for the buck. Could see people using it as a k replacement when it's not about though, not sure what the mxe crowd will think of it. I would far rather this to mxe.


lynx2051 do you think your getting a better feeling orally? More details be good man :D

I don't think "a few weeks" is enough to eradicate a proper dissociative tolerance. I can't tell you what is enough, as I've not gone long enough to find out ![:|](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eyesclosed.gif) but certainly a couple of weeks made no difference to mine.

For me it was more than enough, because there never was much of a tolerance to this class of compounds. Haven't taken MXE or any other dissociative for at least 6 weeks and roughly two weeks after dosing the NEK 20mgs MXE was enough to blow me away.


Whatever, i think plugging it was a total waste so i cannot really say much about it, except that i've found it a bit weaker than expected.

I wish I could say that! If I take 20mgs MXE now, I barely notice any effect. 50mg makes me feel mildly stimulated and a bit stupid.


25mg used to knock me for six. If you want to lose the dissociative magic, just kick the fuck out them for a year ![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif)

A dissociative tolerance is something that lasts a LONG time. Most people who have a serious K tolerance got very little out of MXE, a mate of mine who had a sky high K tolerance when MXE came out ended up doing 150mg lines of MXE to no dissociative effect when he first tried it.


Likewise from what Mugz has said he got virtually nothing off NEK because he'd been abusing MXE for a while. Effie has even said half gram lines of good ketamine do nothing for her since her MXE phase.


I can't stress this enough if you have a proper tolerance to any of these drugs it will have a huge effect on what your likely to get out of trying the rest.

I've never done MXE too regular, just too high dosed as i think. On Monday i had one of the best ever experiences with this stuff, with 20mgs...


It's hard to withstand because it's so nice, but if i can get so much out of it just by doing it not too often, then i'm in!


Whatever, i'll totally give the Nek a second chance, but not atm.

It would be difficult to write a trip report for an oral dose at 100mg. I may go up to 150mg and write a proper report. This is a good chemical but it's just so short lasting when sniffed.

Few trials over past couple days. 


1st was 70mg snorted. Really clogged up sinuses and didn't notice any substantial effects, - though the clogged sinuses and sour drip were very distracting. The thought of taking more in this manner is somewhat unpleasant.


2nd, 100mg plugged. Absolutely no change. Shame as this is a preferred ROA (plugged mxe was bliss).


Considered giving up entirely on the compound.


Then, tonight, 160mg orally. Hands/Feet became a little cold after 10 minutes (vasoconstriction?), then after about 25 minutes began to build into a very gentle euphoria. Not overhwelming and quite pleasant. Some slight dissociation but not too heavy. Will be curious to try a higher dose. Back to baseline in an hour. Wondering how much it would take to hole on this - probably too much to make it economical for a casual explorer?


It has potential but atm it's somewhat overpriced. 


How was sublingual?

None of this thread is about ethyl-ketamine.  Why hasn't the title been changed?


This is quite obviously N-ethylnorketamine.  N-ethylketamine might be interesting, but that's not the subject of the thread.

Nomenclature is a bitch aint it.


Everyone knows what you're talking about if you say "ethylketamine". Nobody is going to make ACHA prodrugs until theyve been legislated to all hell like the cathinones </half-sarcasm>


N,N-ethyl-methyl-2-oxo-(2-chlorophenyl)cyclohexylamine is not even something that's availiable, I don't think. To the best of my knoledge the dialkyl phencyclamines are prodrugs for the 2ndary amines and dont have much activity themselves

That seems unlikely, PCP is obviously active!


Obviously dialkyl substitutions are best when they're in a ring- morpholine or piperidine are apparently best.  However, I'm about 90% sure that 1-(N,N-dimethylamino)-1-phenylcyclohexylamine is active.

Has anyone get any information regarding potential bladder issues/nastyness with N-Ethyl-Ketamine? Obviously since it is fairly similar to regular K, would it be right to assume that the chances of bladder scarring etc will be the same.

Yeah, there's obviously tons.  A compound that has virtually no history of human or even animal testing (certainly no published history) is bound to have tons of information available about the possibility of a rare side effect rarely seen with a related drug...


It's probably best to avoid doing drugs at all, especially those that haven't been tested at all.  Barring that, it's best to limit the dose and frequency of one's use.  Barring that, one should accept that they will likely face both obvious, but more importantly, unforeseen and unforeseeable consequences from their behavior.


I guess if I were using compounds like these, what would scare me most about all about these RC's is that we might going to happen on a teratogen like thalidomide and have a real mess, where your bad choices will not effect just yourself, but will damage any children your conceive.  This is primarily a concern for females who may or may not become pregnant.  There's certainly a positive correlation with drug use and accidental pregnancies.  


Additionally, it's quite possible as we get into more and more novel structures we may happen on a teratogen that doesn't have to be used DURING pregnancy to cause problems.  Or that will damage sperm and cause birth defects through the male contribution to the child.

Lol to the guy 2 posts ago. What they are all talking about IS N-ethyl-ketamine, norketamine is pretty much a misunderstood term and ethyl-ketamine and n-ethyl-ketamine are the same thing are they not?


I would imagine this stuff is not good on the stomach/bladder at all really. It seemed harsher on the nose, and with the doses required being higher/or at least as high. I can't see it being any less damaging really.


It is definately overpriced, ketamine is a little itself at the moment compared to what it used to be, but it's still worth it.

Yes, I'm aware of that. I'm not quite sure what your point is here. The question in my post was directed towards the compound N-Ethyl-Ketamine. Hence why I said this:

.


Concerning bladder/kidneys etc, thats bad news. Not that I have used K before (although I have a sample of N-E-K coming), but I can just imagine people treating this like MXE, and having their bladder fall out into a puddle on the pavement.

Lets just take a step back for a minute shall we. While I agree with hammilton's notion that we all risk possible dire consequences for our dabbling in untested RC's; In this case N-Ethyl-Ketamine is structurally close enough to Ketamine, that we can give a reasonably accurate guess at the effects profile. Of course, I am not for one minute stating that we should throw caution to the wind, and it the spirit of HR, I would say that anyone who starts consuming large and regular quantities of N-E-K, is a great candidate for the Darwin award.


I myself have a 250mg of N-E-K arriving in the next day or so, and truth be told, I am anxious about trying due to: a) having never tried K before, and b)I am aware of bladder issues caused by K use. However, we should be rational about this. One or two lines of a very close K homologue is not going to cause your bladder to shrink to a peanut, and lead to a life of pissing yourself. On the other hand, I would strongly discourage anyone to go about ordering grammes of this stuff, as regular use of a untested compound is just plain stupid. We are pushing our luck far enough as it is (taking an untested chemical), lets not stack the odds against us any further.


As a closing thought though, I am quite concerned about the bladder issues surrounding Ketamine, considering N-E-K is "meant" to be a thrid more potent than Ketamine. I for one value my perfectly working bladder, and don't wish to be using a catheter for the rest of my life. Be careful everyone.

Interesting development, but for the price of one gram of n-ethyl-ketamine I can get three grams of regular ketamine without having to wait to get it shipped to me.


And from a legality viewpoint it wouldn't matter much whether the authorities found one gram of n-ethyl-ketamine on me or one gram of regular ketamine. Consequences would be the same (possession of a small amount of ketamine, i.e. nihil, as in most first world countries) unless they'd be willing to do an involved lab test on the single gram to acertain that it's not regular ketamine but a legal homologue.

They'd have to do a rather elaborate test to distinguish N-EK from Ketamine and I'm not sure if they'd even bother. BTW in my country it's allowed to be held in a cell for up to three days while the lab tests are performed (even though it's very unlikely you'd go to a cell for a tiny bag of suspected ketamine here).

My apologies, I didn't realise howmuch more N-E-K cost you over there. Ketamine here is rather expensive, and most of the stuff you get is cut to shit (Thats the word from a few mates of mine who take it).


I agree, I'm sure N-EK would produce a false positive for Ketamine, which is unfortunate. This is why I always leave the stickers on the bags that state the chemical compounds, as its easier for individuals to identify the compound. Whats your opinion on possible bladder problems with this compound? Its really putting me off sampling N-EK, as I have heard many horror stories of K users basically destroying their bladders.

I'm guessing that it'd act similar on the bladder (and other organs) when very heavily abused. But that's just uneducated guessing. Some other users on bluelight know more about the mechanisms of K's organ-damage.

The bladder issues don't happen from having one heavy weekend on the ketamine, they come from years of near daily abuse. Most of these people doing in excess of 2-3gs a day. In certain parts of the UK (South West mainly), it's not uncommon for people to have 5g+ a day habbits.


I don't see NEK being *that* much worse on the bladder than ketamine if any. And although it is a new chem most of the dissociative analogues seem safer than the stimulant ones.


I didn't see any dirty side to NEK whatsoever. I'll probably buy a gram soon and try again.

How is N-EK on the cardiovascular side of things? I'm leaning towards a small 20mg line to start off with, as I have no tolerance at all with this field of substances. I tried MXE once, and what followed was a fair few hours of confusion and heavy limbs. I was interesting to say the least.

Ye I have to agree with you here. A lot of the reports I've read of other forums sound really positive! I'm guessing it's just not as potent as people thought it was going to be, so slightly larger doses are required than people originally thought. Regardless, its good to start small!

Whilst I concur, it doesn't really stack up in terms of volume consumed. Drinking excessive alcohol will not harm your liver to a (major health concern extent requiring surgery), compared going on a ketamine bender. You only have to do a google search, and there are many threads on BL and Drugs Forum about many individuals who have have consumed ketamine in a moderate amount, and are suffering K pains after only a couple of months.


Despite this, I am looking forward to giving it a whirl, but in small amounts obviously.

If you're at the point of cramps and bladder issues with ketamine then you're so far in that you probably should worry most about the psychological problems. Obviously no one's completely sure how this N-ethyl form will affect the bladder and other the organs down there, there's only SAR speculation.

I'm sure that I am giving far too much credit to the Ketamine bladder problems, although we must awknowledge that this is a legitimate harm. In terms of the N-ethyl group, considering MXE also posessed a N-ethyl group to reduce harmful metabolites in the bladder, so this perhaps bodes well.

Yes we can assume it'll just be as harmful as ketamine in the long run but we won't know until a few years down the line when heavy daily users start coming forward.


You are asking a question that know one knows the answer to.

Yeah, I'm aware that its an impossible question. However, from a pharmacology standpoint, I can give a pretty good guess, that due to the Ethyl group, this should limit the amount of harmful ketamine metabolites in the bladder. I for one drink alot of water daily, so as long as you flush your system through when your using N-EK, I can't see it being too bad. YMMV of course.

You sound as though your quite concerned about health effects of taking a completely new RC, if that's the case then I suggest against trying nek,  otherwise you just have to accept the risks, trying new interesting chemicals is just part of the fun IMO

I'm only concerned in this instance, as N-EK is so close to Ketamine, that it will carry most of its negative effects (which are few, but  still significant). I too find this prospect of good, legal ketamine exciting; I'm just weighing up the risk/reward ratio before I decide how much I want to 'love it'. For example, I have a strong feeling I'm going to enjoy N-EK, so I have be aware of its negative effects; and the closest drug I can base them on is ketamine. As the long term effects of ketamine are bladder damage and addiction in some, I think it is wise to consider how often you would ingest said substance, if it really sarted to appeal to you.


I for one love my psyches and empathogens, so I would probably just keep some N-EK around to take the edge a MDMA comedown or something similar (rather than using it as my DOC)

Come on people, quit it with the price talk, you should all know that that isn't allowed.


And as for urinary tract problems, don't abuse RCs! It's very unwise to treat chemicals with unknown health risks like more well known/studied drugs, it's bad enough to jump into daily usage when we know what will happen.

NO.  WHAT THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT IS NOT N-ETHYL-KETAMINE.


Man, people are so slow.  Keep up.


N-ethyl-Ketamine would mean that the N would be disubstituted.  There would be TWO alkyl residues, an N-ethyl and an N-methyl.  Nor-ketamine is ketamine minus the N-methyl substitution.  N-ethyl-norketamine is ketamine with the N-methyl removed and an N-ethyl added.


This isn't a grey area at all.  This compound is not N-ethyl-ketamine.  That would be a tertiary amine.  This compound is absolutely, decidedly, N-ethyl-norketamine.


There is absolutely no question that this is the case.  Any arguing of this point will make anyone doing so look retarded.  Sekio's point about it being accepted as N-ethylketamine is fine, but it's wrong.  N-ethylketamine may make a fine enough substance (it won't be very potent) but N-ethyl-norketamine- the substance we're actually discussing- is more potent than ketamine proper.  So why make the issue more confused than it is, why not stick to a long understood and useful nomenclature?  Why diverge because it's easier for retarded people to write?


ethnorketamine is not a bad name.  I'd brand it nethnorket.  It's got a nice ring to it.  Can I get a gram of nethnorket?  lol

Thanks Hammilton, I get you now. It was just very confusing, as all the vendors are stating that its Nor-Ethyl-Ketamine. If the substance in question is N-Ethyl-norketamine, doesn't that give more cause for concern, as the metabolite of regular ketamine is norketamine, which is thought to be the cause of many of K's bladder issues.


As for naming, I somehow feel that branding would be an unwise move. I can already see the daily mail jumping all over this one, and I forsee a ban on this in a few months. The name itself screams "BAN ME!!!". Unfortunately, I can foree some meph head idiot getting hold of this, drinking 10 pints of 'Stella Act a Twat', and railing half a g. What follows will be mass media hysteria, and a Daily Mail headline of: "Legal High 3x stronger than the Class C drug Ketamine kills 18 year old from Scunthorpe"

I have never seen the compound in question called "Nor-Ethyl-Ketamine" by anyone - this is just false nomenclature.


the substance in question is not closer related to norketamine than regular ketamine is. all what the cumbersome nomenclature is trying to say is that ethylketamine has an ethyl group where regular ketamine has an methyl group.

In terms of false nomenclature, I have seen many vendors advertising said compound as N-Methyl-ketamine (hence where my confusion came from). I don't really understand why most use MXE as the gold standard. IMO, MXE was a dirty form of ketamine that was far too messy, hence why Im looking forward N-Ethyl-Norketamine. Roll on tomorrow morning I say :D

Sorry I'm not upto scratch on the chemistry side of things, but I was very much under the impression N-ethyl-norketamine and N-ethyl-ketamine were two different drugs. I'm not too sure where your based and sourcing discussion is a no no, but what's being sold by the reputable vendors here in the UK is definately N-ethyl-ketamine (NEK they're calling it). 


I enjoyed it anyway, nice clean euphoria. I'm just wondering will it provide more of a ketamine esq wonk/psychadelic effect at higher doses? I've ordered another 500mg which I should have tomorrow hopefully. I tried high ish doses with my first 250mg sample, upto 170mg but no hole. I found 60mg was enough to feel quite nice off it but i'd be interested to see if there is a hole. Didn't seem like i got much more off 170mg than I did off smaller lines. Might just be that NEK isn't a particularly psychadelic dissociative...


Will report back when i have another bash at it.

seems unusual that a dose as high as 170mg didn't give you much effect, then again when My MXE tolerance was at its highest 120mg was pretty weak.

I should have virtually no tollerance. I didn't enjoy MXE so hardly ever did that. Used to do a fair bit of ketamine but I've only done 2g of that in the last 2 weeks. NEK became active at about 60mg. This is snorted doses. I might try 100mg orally next time then have a few lines.

For those of you wondering about bladder problems with ketamine abuse, google LUTS (Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms). 

The problems have only generally occurred when it is abused significantly over months or years, of course that is not to say the effect is not potentially cumulative. 

It seems to me, i suppose for obvious reasons, there is a lack of people willing to admit to bladder issues, however small, which makes it hard to gain an idea of the extent of the problem. It only usually comes to light at the end of a long addiction, when serious surgery may be required. 

From personal experience, I know that daily use of ketamine for longer than a few weeks and I start to feel very minor bladder issues. This is worse with certain s-isomers than racemic in my experience.Blood in the urine is enough to stop my daily use! 


I think it's fairly safe to assume that the effects profile of n-ethyl Ketamine are very similar and will probably carry the same long term risks, but we dont know at this stage, it will definitely be seriously habit forming so please tread carefully, anybody who decides to use this stuff daily before at least a few months of feedback only has themselves to blame. You have to weigh up the risks and buy your ticket. 

I personally have a gram hopefully arriving tomorrow but my k tolerance may prove an issue...

Got two grams yesterday: Tested insufflated and IM. Seems the dosages are about equal to ketamine: 80 mg insufflated as a start was comfortable, but irritates the nose more. My nose is still clogged. IM seems to be the way to go though, like ketamine (at least for me). 200 mg created a nice hole, identical to ketamine. Nice to be able to hole again, sick of methoxetamine mania. All in all: A great ketamine, all though noticed more muscular soreness than regular ketamine. All gone now though.

Rather disappointing substance. Dosage required is the same if not higher than ketamine, duration is much shorter and the effects aren't nearly as deep. It is however somehow more euphoric in a weird way, but definately less psychedelic and very, very moreish. Im guessing there's some impurities with the first batch(es) as well, snorting one sizeable line clogs up your nose with bleeding and everything next morning, there were also very slight allergic symptoms, so do your tests proper. IM makes your muscles very sore, IV seems safer than with ket or mxe as it doesn't seem to knock you totally unconscious at comparable doses, but you'll still have holes in your memory afterwards. Hell I was literally walking after IVing a decent amount with very low tolerance, trying to clean up after injecting but it was kind of confusing. 


It would be interesting to see how well this combines with mxe or ketamine taken simultaneously, perhaps resulting in a more euphoric, happy type of a hole. Note that it's extremely hard to 'hole' with ethyl-ketamine, it just doesn't feel visual enough. Also, perhaps the metabolites are even less psychedelic/psychoactive resulting in much faster sobering up after dosing. Ethyl-ketamine has potential, but it's still disappointing, definately doesn't live up to ketamine or even mxe for that matter IMO, though they all are three distinctively different substances. I'm sure it has it's own niche, but I don't know...


All dosing was eyeballed so I'd rather not even start guessing what the doses are, but there were all the allergy test doses, tiny doses, medium doses and big doses in the testing. Ended up consuming much more of it than ketamine or mxe in one session, probably because the sought after effect were less intense, duration was quite short and the nature of the drug was just moreish and euphoric in an odd way.


EDIT: Also worth mentioning, the headspace on ethyl-ketamine was rather odd, the substance isn't nearly as anxiolytic as mxe or ketamine, when playing with those two dissociatives I've never really experienced anxiety or paranoia relating to my thought or experiences, but on the highest IM dose of kethyl, I actually had minor anxiety and paranoia, leading to me taking roughly 0,125mg clonazepam. Otherwise I experienced a little bit more lucid headspace compared mxe/ket like others, but I actually considered it negative when it came to the dissociative experience. I'd say this downplays kethyls medical potential when it comes to depression etc, atleast when compared to the alternatives.

> Got two grams yesterday: Tested insufflated and IM. Seems the dosages are about equal to ketamine: 80 mg insufflated as a start was comfortable, but irritates the nose more. My nose is still clogged. IM seems to be the way to go though, like ketamine (at least for me). 200 mg created a nice hole, identical to ketamine. Nice to be able to hole again, sick of methoxetamine mania. All in all: A great ketamine, all though noticed more muscular soreness than regular ketamine. All gone now though.

This is interesting. I have 500mg coming today, I have pins too but no micron filter, might have to keep back some for an IM.


I'll probably just do a few 100mg lines then a 200mg to round it off. Was the hole a proper out of body experiance or just confusing? Even a lot of ketamine isn't capable of the out of body type hole, it depends what isomer/if it's leaning towards the S-isomer a bit it's usually possible. The likes of ketamax and ketaset never provide any real interesting adventure holes.


As for potency sounds like NEK is about the same as K maybe a fraction more like 1/5th or something. I definately found it far more enjoyable than I ever did MXE.

I'm not too sure where your based and sourcing discussion is a no no, but what's being sold by the reputable vendors here in the UK is definately N-ethyl-ketamine (NEK they're calling it).

The "nor" prefix properly refers to the removal of an alkyl group from a nitrogen.  I'm not entirely sure if this can refer to amides or only amines.  I believe it can properly refer to either but someone else would have to comment on that.  Norketamine is ketamine without the N-methyl group.  It is a primary amine.  N-ethyl-norketamine is absolutely, unequivocally the compound that has been described here.  Insisting on it being N-ethyl-ketamine is like saying that heroin is diacetylcodeine.


I was expecting my comment to be met with "we know it's N-ethyl-norketamine, but we prefer to call it n-ethylketamine because it's easier" or something similar, not actual opposition to the truth of the matter.  Calling this N-ethyl-ketamine (which is isn't) only confuses what we should be calling the REAL n-ethylketamine which is a real compound and may be active enough to be used.

Eventually people need to start getting away from abbreviating everything and actually name compounds.

Unfortunately ending in amine is overly common.  Perhaps something based on phenylcyclidine.  Ethylcyclodone perhaps.  I don't know, I don't really care, but a systematized naming system instead of what has become and endless run of acronyms.

Jesus christ dude I didn't ask for a lecture. I already said I'm useless with chemistry, my bad, forget it. 


I've done a lot of dissociatives and this one is interesting. What I find weird is it's not that psychadelic (which is why I love Ketamine), this is more a smooth happy euphoria. I recieved 500mg today, I've done 90mgs up the hooter and I can feel my vision has become slightly more crisp, my thoughts more concise. It's like very clean ketamine.


I'm hoping I'll be able to report back on some sort of hole experiance tonight if it's possible to hole on, there are a few reviews suggesting it is.

@Rockstar: What is this like on the cardiovascular side compared to real ketamine? I have a low resting Heart rate and low blood pressure, so I'm curious to know before I get my wonk on!


EDIT: Quick question. My SO has just started a course of Citalopram (SSRI's), and as far a I know, there are interactions between Ketamine and anti-depressants, but obviously since this isn't ketamine, I don't want to let her near it. Wise move?

It is indeed quite lacking in the psychedelia department. If you try to "hole" with this substance, I believe you will reach unconsciousness before you achieve a sufficient state of psychedelia on top of the dissociation (atleast when compared to the depth of ketamine or mxe). It's a powerful anesthetic with analgesic properties, it WILL fuck you up, though not necessarily in a good way. Recreational value is much lower than that of ketamine imo, however the bodyhigh is rather unique so YMMV. Be careful with this stuff, I'd say it has a quite narrow 'recreational index' (think of therapeutic index). I believe this substance is simply not capable of doing what ketamine or mxe can do with larger doses, and if you try and chase that expected high you will quite probably end up blacking out. The more you take this substance, the less you can resist it's moreish qualities, it's easy to go out of control so be careful...


I'd say n-ethyl-ketamine kinda feels like what ketamine should feel in a medical environment, anesthesia with less psychic side effects. I'm guessing if someone made propyl-ketamine it would be a step backwards when it comes to recreation.


I'm still having some lingering confusion as an after effect of consuming an unknown but substantial amount of kethyl so try bear with my possibly incoherent writing.

Thanks for the report FnX. I too found that the recreational scope for this substance is fairly narrow. However, one thing that concerns me about N-EK is that due to the strong anaethetic propertites, I feel that the LD50 for this compound would be alot  lower compared to ketamine. This is rather worrysome, as compared to ketamine where you can do grammes in a session, I have a feeling that a high does of N-EK would be dangerous for many. Obviously, I don't have solid fact to back this up, but I experienced strong anaesthetic effects, which while weren't dangerous at all, gave me the feeling that you cannot binge on N-EK like you can on K. On the upside, I felt no compulsion to redose on this substance at all.

I've not noticed any effect on heart rate whatsoever mate. I did 90mgs around 11am this morning, went for a lovely walk with the headphones in, felt good.


I've just done 100mg maybe a bit more. It hits very quickly but the kind of hype up to what would usually end up in la la land with ketamine never really comes, its just clean and functional, but it is euphoric. I really like it but I think 100mg is about the least it's worth dosing. I also have my doubts about any K-hole type experiance being possible.

Yeah man I can kinda see what you are saying. I don't see the hole being a possibility either. I did 170mg when I first got it and couldn't hole. I have about 300mg left at the moment which I will be doing today but I'm not so sure I'll go mad high with the dosing, 170mg never really felt much different from 100mg in all honesty.


Also what are people saying to using this orally, any good? It is a bit short lasting sniffed, probably 30-40mins max of fun. I do like this drug though.

NO! Hammilton is certainly right, his post is necessary and I am thankful that he invested the energy to write it in such detail.


I totally see that nomenclature shouldn't be exaggerated (i.e. IUPAC names instead of more convenient trivial names) but we absolutely can not accept giving substances names that **obviously do not correspond to their correct structure**!


It's a pity that we need to actually discuss this (several times).

However, one thing that concerns me about N-EK is that due to the strong anaethetic propertites, I feel that the LD50 for this compound would be alot  lower compared to ketamine. This is rather worrysome, as compared to ketamine where you can do grammes in a session, I have a feeling that a high does of N-EK would be dangerous for many. Obviously, I don't have solid fact to back this up, but I experienced strong anaesthetic effects, which while weren't dangerous at all, gave me the feeling that you cannot binge on N-EK like you can on K. On the upside, I felt no compulsion to redose on this substance at all.

Did around 120mg orally and got absolutely nothing


I then waited a while and did 100mg plugged which i thought would be a total waste of time but was actually rather effective, reminded me of the feeling of a low MXE dose plugged, warm and euphoric, then again it couldve been that the oral takes a while to kick in but its a bit of a coincidence how it happened about 5 mins after plugging![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


I'll try again tonight :D

Indeed, Ketamine most certainly induces anaethesia. However (I think my point came across wrong here) IMO, N-EK isn't a very recreational substance; in that the line between pleasent euphoria and strong anaethesia isn't much. Perhaps this is because I have no K tolerance at all, and therefore am very sensitive to this compound (this is most likely, as others are reporting 100mg + and still functioning). However, I did 80mg in total, and I felt like I was melting into the sofa, and trying to walk just ended up in me nearly falling over myse


**EDIT:** Just saw the comment about nose bleeds. Does anyone know if it would be possible to hydrate N-EK (much like you do K) to make it easier on the nose etc. Crushing the crystals is one thing with a card is one thing, but I feel rehydrating N-EK would do wonders for our nasal passages.

I feel like this does more damage to the nose than Ethylphenidate. Ethylphenidate begins to hurt about 5 seconds after snorting then the pain lasts for about another 15 seconds. With Ethyl-Ketamine it instantly hurts your nose for about 10 seconds then suddenly stops, but then you're left with a really, really blocked nose afterwards for several hours.


It's possible that the only reason I got a nose bleed from Ethyl-Ketamine is because I smoked some weed during the trip. Possibly because of the vasodialation?

I would say any bleeding from the nose is a sign to stop that MOI. This is why I suggested hydrating the N-EK, and then crushing into a fine powder. Many users of K find that hydrating their ketamine before use makes it experience alot easier on the nose.


I suggest covering your N-EK crystals in a small bit of warm water, and then boiling it off. Then crush your N-EK into a fine dust with a razor blade/card, and you should be set.

The thing is, unlike most anesthetics, ketamine actually stimulates the respiratory system instead of depressing it making it a very safe anesthetic. The substance sold as n-ethyl-ketamine felt different though, it didn't *feel* like it was stimulating the respiratory system to a similiar degree and death via overdose felt like a possibility. If the duration wasn't as short as it is, I think we might be looking at a very dangerous substance to abuse. Also, having a terrible headache the day after binging ~700mg or so in an evening, and no, I didn't have any particular tolerance to dissociatives before dosing. Never at one point during the binge was I satisfied at the effects I got, it felt like something crucial was missing.

FnX has hit the nail on the head here. There is something slightly dark about this substance, because (as already said), it didn't feel stimulating respiratory wise at all. This for me rings massive alarm bells regarding safety, and I certainly won't be ordering any more. I don't think the risk is worth taking with this one.

That summary of N-ethyl-norketamine near the bottom of that first post seems to describe a potency in line with what was expected from the compound. Perhaps purity is an issue with what is going around.

I am very disappointed all round. 

If you have a ketamine tolerance I wouldn't bother. Just felt like piss weak k but the sting on the nostril well outlasts any feeling from the drug. I hope the sting is from impurities otherwise it's a no go for me. 

If the following batches are a bit kinder on the hooter and the price gets down to £10-15/g then it might be worth a look. 


The info regarding breathing depression is worrying though. If this product doesn't share a similar safety profile to ketamine it could be very dangerous. The only reason why k is so abusable is because it keeps you breathing no matter how much you have. If this substance depresses breathing at anaesthetic levels it will be extremely dangerous. Please be careful

It doesn't. Well, it may do in terms of LUTS etc, but in terms of breathing, I would say less so. The problem with this compound is that there is something quite dark about it, but you can't quite put your finger on it. For example, where as with K, you could sit and do grammes without concern of RD, something in he back of your mind stops you from pushing N-EK, as you know it will end in tears.


N-EK is going to bring more negativity to the RC scene, as kids are going to get hold of this who have no K tolerance, and treat it with the same safety profile as K.

Yeah I hope this one doesn't end in tears. It's not exactly going to get added to the WHO list of essential medicines alongside ketamine is it? 


It's no surprise to me that this chem was a fall back option when 2mk became unviable. They couldn't just drop it without something similar to sell in its place after the hype that had built up around it.

Just a thought, but is it not feasible that when ketamine was first developed as an anaesthetic (by Parke-Davis back in the 60s?) it was one of several related compounds being considered?


I would suspect that both N-Ethyl-Norketamine and N-Methyl-Norketamine were developed and tested alongside each other for their potential pharmaceutical use. Safety-profile, potency, duration and cost-effectiveness would, amongst others, have been likely criteria for these tests . If this is the case then I would I imagine that there are good reasons why N-Methyl-Norketamine was chosen as the compound to ultimately become pharmaceutical Ketamine.


Anyone else have any thoughts or knowledge on this?

People have been looking for the unabridged Park-Davis trials for a long time, and to the best of my knowledge only snippets have been recovered. Some valuable info in there for sure.. . 


Good to see some reason and logic in this thread Hamilton, unfortunately in these threads of the "the next big thing" that swell to 100 pages overnight reason and logic fall on deaf ears. I'm just waiting for the awful "meow-meow"  name equivalent to come along. . .this signals scheduling haha. Or is it already "ethylketamine"?


As far as bladder damage, ketamine induced ulcerative cystitis is *believed* to be the result of an acidic metabolite, possibly due to n-dealkylation, possibly not. methoxetamine, as well as n-ethylnorketamine, are also subject to this dealkylation, producing  the nor metabolite. Could be some other metabolite as well, or something else entirely.  we just  don't know yet. So hearing that the current "version" of this drug requires a  Higher dose, lasts shorter, and has some other unforeseen effects, makes alarm bells ring in my head. Could be an even better candidate for problems! personally, I believe the higher dose is because of a shitty synthesis, as well as the excessive " burn", but who knows, maybe PD knew something we don't, or that our projected SAR is off. people really seemed to misinterpret FnB in regards to to the n-ethyl on MXE making it less of a candidate for bladder issues. This altered kinetics, and a lower dose being required, but from what I've seen people sure push it often and frequently with MXE as well. We'll see what the tide brings in. Personall, I wouldn't touch this n-ethylnorketamine until a lot more "data", and a more refined synth come out, and who knows even then. Don't trust these folks with my best interests in heart, and I don't applaud their motives - profit, at the cost of everything else, one bit.


Cheers, be safe

We'll try being more accurate in the name of the thread for now, to make the ADD guys happy (why don't you email the vendors and request them to fix the nomenclature?). If being technically correct is too confusing for Tom, Dick, and Harry we'll have to go back though.

So we can agree that the substance in question is indeed an analog of the ketamine metabolite, not ketamine itself? That would explain a lot of things imo. First of all, unless I'm mistaken, orally taken ketamine is metabolized in the liver to norketamine before it reaches the brain. It's commonly accepted that when you ingest ketamine this way, it's a lot less psychedelic and you need a much bigger dose to achieve the same effects, even as much as 4-5x (source: erowid) the dose as you would need nasally or IM. So, this substance sold as n-ethyl-ketamine should be compared to the ketamine metabolite norketamine instead of ketamine itself. Now the marketing speeches sort of make more sense, I think this substance being sold is more potent than regular norketamine, but still quite a bit less potent than ketamine itself. God, the nomenclature is indeed very confusing.

I bought this fact up earlier in the thread, but I was shot down by Hammilton and his squad of chemistry police. But you are correct, it does explain alot of things. I'm also rather disturbed at the amount of RC's that have been emerging, that are simply liver metabolites that come from the original chemicals (Ethylphenidate for one). There seems to be a trend with these, in that they have many undesireable effects (with the exception of 4-HO-MET, which was lovely)

in ethylketamine, the n-methyl group of regular ketamine has been replaced with an n-ethyl group, whereas norketamine has no n-substitution at all. so the n-alkyl substitution has been lengthened in the step from ketamine to ethylketamine, so in a certain sense ethylketamine is further away from norketamine than ketamine itself. when one orders according to the length of the side chain, one gets the following series:


0 norketamine

1 ketamine

2 ethylketamine


perhaps it makes this point even clearer when one remembers that ketamine could be also referred to as n-methyl-norketamine (as someone already mentioned in this thread).


btw, here is a picture of norketamine for your comparison:

That just takes it to moronic lengths and doesn't prove anything aside from the fact that (A-B)+B = A.  Fallacious reasoning.

Such (moronic) naming refers to one compound, and one compound only.  That's why no one (with intelligence) would refer to it in such a way.  N-E-NorKet MUST be referred to as such because otherwise you create potentially dangerous ambiguity.

> 		
> Click to expand...


Wow...  this is just getting retarded.   It's a fucking analogue of both of them.  And what relevance does this have to the naming of the compound?  You could call it Ethetamine or anything and have a perfectly usable non-ambiguous trivial name.  Either call it what is or come up with something new.  Don't advocate for people's lives at risk because your ability to understand a truly simple naming process is impaired.


Honestly, this is like asking for the RC industry to get even more murky.


I can't believe that someone would admit to find the use of "nor" complicated, [proof that I'm capable of self censoring]


The whole reason for using the correct nomenclature is to account for the fact that the naming you're advocating refers to an entirely different compound.  Here are just a few reasons not to use the moronic nomenclature you're advocating:


1.  IT REFERS TO AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT DRUG.  If your naming system results in people being unable to tell the difference between two different drugs it is DANGEROUS.


2.  WHAT DO WE NOW REFER TO THE REAL N-ETHYL-KETAMINE?  Is that NEK-2?  N-Ethyl-Ketamine version 2.0?


3.  USING THIS MORONIC SYSTEM, AN RC VENDOR MAY PLACE AN ORDER FOR N-ETHYL-KETAMINE and actually receive N-Ethyl-Ketamine.  You know, NEK-2 or N-Ethyl-Ketamine ver 2.0.  I know, your system is supposed to be simpler right.  Perhaps NEK-2 is actually toxic.  Now people are dying.  Perhaps it turns out to be much weaker (as it probably is)  someone switches from high doses of that to high doses of NEK ver 1.0 without realizing it (because without pictures and analysis there's no way to actually tell) and they're talking to God face to face, in the undesired way.


The real, accepted nomenclature does not cause people to believe that it's an analogue of a metabolite or the more common drug.  That's just people not understanding chemistry.  That same misunderstanding occurs within all sorts of compounds for which there are no naming disputes (this isn't a dispute really- there's only one right answer.  there's also a dumb answer, that's undeniable, but there's only one right one).

Yeah...  so what?  it's almost certainly closer in terms of pharmacology as well.  That's irrelevant in naming the compound.  Perhaps we should rename Dextromethorphan because people might get confused and think it's an opiate?

Does this substance have an anti-depressant quality like ketamine? Has anyone tried low doses for this purpose?

No.


Norketamine is also an analogue of ketamine, it makes no sense at all to suggest that N-ethyl-norketamine is somehow "closer" to norketamine. Nomenclature is no indication of effects.

Although I *completely agree* that the name **N-ethyl-norketamine** is the most correct and should therefore be the one to be used (certainly on this site at least), I think its probably fair to say that the abbreviation N-EK is the one thats going to stick, especially with the vendors and therefore with the public.


I still find myself having to refer to the APBs as Benzo Fury around intelligent people so they know what I'm talking about. Instead of saying which particular 3-MeO-PCx I sniffed last night I find that everyone knows what I mean when I refer to it as "that PCP stuff". I know plenty of people who still struggle with the term RC in general. You start firing off relatively long chemical names or a load of numbers and letters and most people just get confused.


I would say that N-EK and ethylketamine are sufficient names to distinguish this stuff from the standard product in the eyes of the average Joe, regardless of whether they are technically correct. Ideally we would have a decent naming convention for all arylcyclohexylamines but that would almost certainly involve renaming ketamine, something thats not likely to happen. Perhaps though we could make some sort of list of names like:


Ketamine  =  N-methyl-norketamine  =  2-Cl-2-Oxo-PCM

N-EK  =  N-ethyl-norketamine  =  2-Cl-2-Oxo-PCE

2-MK  =  2-methoxy-deschloroketamine  =  2-MeO-2-Oxo-PCM


Anyone care to expand this list?

It’s not stronger by a factor of 2 or 3 but 100mg i.m. knocked me out totally and I was EthylK-holing for about an hour. So it didn’t really alter duration of experience. It’s got already a broken piperidine ring, ethyl is known to be the best when it comes to potency so here it is, get an S-enantiomer and you’ve got a winner.

N-ENK would be better, absolutely. I kinda think though that the vendors have decided their make-it-sound-as-close-to-ketamine-as-possible name and thats what will stick. No doubt there will be some variant on the rhino/dino theme in some areas too.

Yeah, I had totally forgotten about that post, some valuable info in there, 


I have had nowhere near those effects from this batch though. Tolerance is an issue undoubtedly but I can't imagine any amount of this substance could make me hole, I have gone through a gram in short order and felt almost nothing, tolerance or not thats unacceptable. 

I doubt it's a poor synth. I just can't see a value if you can get ketamine it have any sort of tolerance, and certainly not at this price. It hurts my nose too much and it leaves me blocked up for 24 hours after a dose. 


I seriously doubt this one, whatever it's called, is going to get popular. It's just Supermarket Value brand Diet Ket isn't it? 


Suppose it could be a good intro for dissociatives for people scared of the k hole..

i'm not scared of holes, and like short, sharp trip.

What I am scared of is: blacking out and wandering the streets with no shirt on throwing things at passing cars PCP stylee.

So did think this stuff would fit the bill, but the chemistry confusion, nose bleeds and general air of dissappointment is making me wonder if its worth risking such a new compound.


but think its gunna take off, in the Uk if nowhere else....shoveling crappy over-priced powder is now as english as knotted hankies and a nice cup of tea in the morning

i had a free day so i gave this stuff a try 250mgs total. i started small with 10mg and built up to a 90mg line snorted. i dont have much experience with ketamine or mxe so didnt have any expectations and i dont know what its like to hole. it was a pleasant enough afternoon sitting about listening to music. i felt pretty relaxed. 


it had a moderate anti-depressive and anxiolotic effect. it doesnt last that long though. afterwards now though i feel my mind is kind of foggy and a wee while ago i blew my nose and some blood came out which was a bit worrying.


overall id say its not really that worth it unless the price comes down and the purity goes up if it can.

@Hammilton: while you're obviously correct on all points, I don't know if it's worth spending the effort renaming this when in all probability it's not going to be around much longer anyway. Sure, we could come up with a name, but that would even in the best case simply promote the use of yet another untested and unknown drug. Also, methylone, ethylone, butylone is kind of an ambiguous series, and *eutylone* just sounds awful.


Though, for clarity: this is not the very-likely-inactive compound that would be called "n-ethyl-ketamine", though it is valid IIRC to exclude the prefix *nor-* in forming an acronym NEK.

Snorted 250mg of this 5 days ago, have been away so havn't had the chance to post this earlier, this 250mg was consumed the day after my original trial of 100mg and I found myself fiending really badly for a re-dose all day so gave in. 


This time the euphoric state acheived last time was not present, there were no hallucinations or CEV's even after smoking cannabis, my apologies for my original post claiming it to be potentially as good as ketamine i know do not think this is going to be the case.


250mg insuffulated didn't appear to have any much more of an effect than 100mg and I felt nowhere near a hole (bear in mind K can hole me at 130mg), im assuming it would have produced the visual state had I waited a few days before trying it again as I find that ketamine day after day doesn't really make me hole properly.

Once again though all I can say is AVOID SNORTING THIS STUFF!!!  Nasal damage be fucked, I have never snorted anything that has messed my nose up so badly (And I sniff 2C-B and Ethylphenidate quite frequently with no complaints at all),

Its still fucked now, pain, blowing out reams and reams of snot for days after, it's all irritated and dry around the sides and my left nostril now produces a whistiling noise when I breath in and for about 2 hours after sniffing it I was sneezing and blowing my nose and focussing on how sore it was to be able to enjoy any of the miniscule effects that were present. 


I will either be plugging or consuming orally the remaining 200mg I have and let you know whether it works for me or not as i have seen conflicting reports on this issue.

I very much doubt I will be purchasing this again its just not worth it unless it works orally and the price goes down drastically (£10-£15 a g perhaps to make it a viable option imo), its a real shame I cant seem to score any good quality ketamine as I would say its definately a better option although saying this my first trial of 100mg insufflated was more euphoric than k in a weird way, primarily in the body and it was certainly alot more moreish, I literally couldnt get it out of my head until i redosed, I find a similar thing with mephedrone. I got a bad feeling about this one despite my initial report, will be interesting to see how this develops.


Much love + Happy tripping =]

Well, I haven't tried this stuff yet and judging by the feedback I'm not so excited that I'll get some in this weekend. I do want to give it a go though, alongside 2-MK when that surfaces, but the prices aren't exactly endearing me, even moreso considering my general dissociative/anything tolerance means i'll have to get a whole gram and expect to clear it in a night.


I am curious in principle whether this one might interact well with 3-MeO-PCP, I don't expect anyone to recommend it here but I have a suspicion it could be quite interesting. I'll also be looking to try out my usual butylone combo aswell. So it seems I've already got several grams worth of experiments planned out here, maybe when the price comes down...

The good news is it does have some very nice sub hole euphoric ant-depressant effects.


The bad news is its very bad on the nose especially the day after, stings like a bitch when snorting it and it really is super short lasting, you'll be coming down in literally 10 minutes, you'll need to snort quite alot if you have any lingering tolerance and lastly of course the price is too high.


In all honesty IMO its just not worth it for the bad points above for the effects you get.

Ok so i went ahead and plugged my remaining 205mg, its certainly not completely inactive via this route but it was very mild, mild yet really enjoyable, a positive mood lift and slight brightening of colors were present as well as some vague dissasociative-esque swirling behind the eyes, would be lovely if it wasn't so expensive.


I can function well on this dose and cant imagine anyone picking up on the fact im on it which is cool. I wonder if a hole is possible with this compound? will be interesting to find out although I imagine the dosage required to reach the hole would be very high and potentially dangerous. So far i'm thinking this one may be better off enjoyed in smaller doses just enjoying the subtle effects as opposed to hoping for it to enter you into the matrix like ketamine does lol.

I had read Adders post on PCP analogs before deciding to test the substance which shall not be named anymore so nobody gets offended and it is indeed very inconsistent with what we are collectively experiencing here. It makes one wonder wether the first batch of chemical tagged as "n-ethyl-ketamine" was something other than the molecule depicted in the picture they have where it is being sold at. Part of the effects felt serotonergic in a weird way that had me thinking the sample could have been adultered with some mild, moreish euphoriant. The day after there was noticeable nausea (=impurities?), some depression, anxiety and restlessness. I didn't find this substance an effective antidepressant like ketamine or mxe are, in fact the whole experience felt depressing, perhaps due to the disappointment in effects. The experience didn't feel meaningful in any psychological way, and unless I'm mistaken, the psychedelic effects from MXE and ketamine (which were very much missing from NEK) are essential for antidepressive outcomes.


Tolerance built up extremely rapid and on the day after primary experiments, the remaining ~200mg or so I had managed to produce only slight loss of motor control and relaxation, which faded in about 30 minutes. I actually found it kinda fascinating how fast ALL of the effects dissipated with IV adminstration. With regular ketamine you are usually left with hours of grogginess, no matter what RoA. The tendency to form foam in mouth was also present like with regular ketamine, but vastly higher doses of NEK were required to achieve that, still with extremely minimal psychedelia.


Something just doesn't feel right here, I had planned to save a small sample of the sample for detailed analysis to scout for impurities and adulterants, but well, if there are dissociatives in my cupboard they don't tend to stay there for long, no matter how useless they are. There's always that little voice telling me "maybe they are useful but you just haven't found a purpose yet..." heh.


EDIT: On the chemistry side, can someone explain me if ketamine metabolizes to norketamine through demethylation and hydroxylation how can we call NEK n-ethyl-norketamine when norketamine has a double hydrogen with the NH2 there? I mean shouldn't it stop being norketamine altogether if you start sticking extra carbons in place of the hydrogens? I would have thought that n-ethyl-norketamine implies that there's a chain of two carbons sticking out after the NH2 which I doubt we're going to see happen.

it's no hydroxylation - that would mean adding an OH-group.

hydrogens are mostly ignored in organic chemistry, because one assumes that everything is saturated with hydrogens when nothing else is said. while this is not as strict for nitrogen as for carbon (which always has four bonds), you still have the same principle here. when you remove a methyl from a nitrogen, you have to add a hydrogen instead, otherwise you would end with a radical.

indeed it does stop being norketamine after ethylation - but as I have already stretched, the correct nomenclature is both cumbersome and misleading.

again the IUPAC nomenclature strikes: ethylation in organic chemistry generally means replacing a hydrogen with an ethyl group.

the abbreviation PCM is problematic itself, because some people use it for the morpholine analogue of PCP, e.g. here: [http://catbull.com/alamut/Lexikon/Mittel/pcm.htm](https://catbull.com/alamut/Lexikon/Mittel/pcm.htm)


but for the sake of clear nomenclature, PCM should be used in the way you did (what would be the full IUPAC name of this compound - 1-phenyl-1-(methylamino)cyclohexane ?), and the aforementioned morpholine analogue of PCP should be therefore called PCMo (as the english-language wikipedia already does).


now what obviously also needs to be listed is;


methoxetamine = 3-MeO-2-Oxo-PCE

Gave this compound a test last night. Its like a very calm, non chaotic, non confusing version of MXE. It doesn't produces the mania MXE tends to give, it's much more "controllable" and give a heavier bodyfeel than MXE (Which is good, because on MXE you on walk around on m-hole doses)


But... It really damages the nasal membranes, I don't understand why plugging shouldn't work? If insufflating works, why shouldn't plugging? I'm not saying you are wrong, I just don't understand why it doesn't work.

Insufflating is not a good harm reduction ROA because it really clogs and makes your nose sore the next day. Thank god I have a nasal spray with moisturizers -**it really does wonders!** highly recommended.


Is oral the only way to go? If yes, what doses? (Minor tolerance only)

yes, this compound is definitely much closer to ketamine than to methoxetamine, in the sense that the stimulating/manic effects do not occur. in higher doses, ethylketamine just leads to calm dissociated effects, just like ketamine.


I just had my first proper dose yesterday, and I really like this substance. I went through 500 mg within the course of several hours nasally. first observation: for me, this compound is just as easy on the nose as regular ketamine, it even has a similar taste/smell/feeling in the nose, which I actually appreciate a lot. it just contributes to my pleasant anticipation to sense the ketamine taste in my nose. of course I have grinded my material to a fine powder before snorting, as it is IMHO mandatory with any substance one plans to consume nasally.


maybe the people complaining about nose problems have never realized the importantce for mechanical breakup of compounds intended for nasal use...? hard to imagine for me that this could be a big revelation to someone, but then again one reads too often that for some "silent rollers" the only technique to powderize ketamine seems to be to dissolve it in water and then cook it off again... 8)


coming to the effects: it is very similar to ketamine, basically. sweet dissociation, music appreciation, complex geometrical closed eye visuas... for me as a ketamine lover, the same magic is there within this compound. I get the same psychedelic, euphoric and visionary effects out of ethylketamine that I also get from regular ketamine. I cannot find anything in this experience that is "darker" than ketamine. in some sense I cannot explain, the ketamine/ethketamine experience always felt turquoise to me; the subtle differences in quality of the experience then maybe can be described as ketamine more on the blue side, and ethketamine more on the green side (or the other way round, I'm not sure yet ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) ). basically, what I am trying to say is that the qualitative effect of both compounds feels very similar to me, with only slight differences that are hard to put in word (in the same way as it is hard to explain the difference between e.g. 4-HO-MET and 4-HO-MiPT).


also, I did not experience any other negative side effects, just like with ketamine; the only thing I could complain about is some lingering stimulation after the psychedelic effects have already ended, but this again is completely the same with usual ketamine, and can be easily cured by a little etizolam. on the next day, I woke up completely refreshed and feeling fine.


the only negative thing I can say about ethylketamine is that the duration is a bit shorter than regular ketamine, while the potency is only slighty increased (what a pity the SAR prediction of two- or threefold increased potency did not turn out to be true...). because of that, I still didn't hole on ethylketamine this time, but I came close. unfortunately, I had a huge tolerance for dissociatives from the beginning (my first tries with ketamine were all very disappointing, because I did the same amound everyone else did to hole, which gave me only mediocre effects - then I realized I just need much more than others - but then, I am also quite big and heavy), and this tolerance of course even increased with years of use (I did no heavy abuse of arylcyclohexylamines execpt for one heavy methoxetamine binge, but as you know, dissociative tolerance builds up quick and decays only very slowly). so next time I will be using ethylketamine, I will make sure to get an initial dose of 300 mg nasally, and I have no doubt this will give a wounderful hole. again, words of caution: that is just me and my tolerance. I can perfectly imagine a lighthead already holing on 150 mg ethket nasally or even less.


with all the things said above, one has to admit that this compound is quite pricey compared to regular ketamine. but since all my ketamine connections have dried up and I wasn't able to purchase my favourite delight in over a year, I really appreciate this compound appearing on the RC market. hopefully, we will see a significant price slash before the inevitable ban, so that I can buy a lifetime supply of this gem...

I really don't know how you can say its easy on the nose, doubt I'll be doing anymore, I'm still getting blood whenever I blow my nose.


Either this stuff is naturally eroding on the nose or it's got really bad impurities in it.

> The name is obviously wrong but it’s easy to know what hides there. This is just ketamine with ethyl on amine (just like in case of PCE). This obviously had an impact on drug potency. It’s not stronger by a factor of 2 or 3 but 100mg i.m. knocked me out totally and I was EthylK-holing for about an hour. So it didn’t really alter duration of experience. It’s got already a broken piperidine ring, ethyl is known to be the best when it comes to potency so here it is, get an S-enantiomer and you’ve got a winner.

This report (from the link Transform posted above) seems to be coming from someone with a large experience in arylcyclohexylamines and access to personal lab synthesis. That report also seems to somewhat fit the expected profile of the chemical. So either the purity and composition of the batch going around is questionable, or this report is false in some way. It would be nice to see some NMR/HPLC for the current batch.


That same guy also reports 2-MeO-ketamine as not having much difference from regular ketamine in comparison to effect and dose.

The popular myth is that ketamine is metabolised into norketamine, which irritates the bladder. But nobody has ever actually done any sort of controlled studies to show that conclusively. All we can say for sure is **some **individuals will have bladder problems induced by **high-dose, chronic** ketamine use. It's spotty, and not everyone who uses loads of K will have bloody piss. Those that do get problems will stop increasing in severity and may even recede somewhat when use of ketamine is stopped.


Bladder damage is reported in the medical literature from clinical usage of ketamine, so it's not likely it's a cut. It is more likely that some people are predisposed to ketamine or its metabolites being more irritating than usual. But like I said nobody knows for sure.

That's not really true. Some people have had to have their bladders surgically removed. The best course of action would simply be not to abuse it in the first place. Just use your frikken common sense and don't be holing any more than once a week, which is still far too often.

Dissolved 150mg in 1.5ml water (it's piss easy to dissolve) and squirted it up my nostril, holding my other nostril closed.


No pain whatsoever. Feels and tastes very like ketamine.


Feels nice and wonky.


I think a fair bit of this has gone down my throat though, will need to try and increase the concentration.


Absolutely no pain though, if our batches are the same then the pain must be a mechanical thing.


Either that or I wake up tomorrow in agony!

Has there been anyone who has actually got some physical characteristics for this supposed ethyl-norketamine? Shit like m.p. of the salt, top limit of solubility in water etc, perhaps optical activity?


In short: has there been any convincing evidence to suggest this is really ENK? Or has it been the usual bioassays-only?

I'll happily try and find the solubility limit, but it won't be that accurate as the cops took my lab scales.


EDIT: Do you know what it should be, Sekio?


EDIT 2: Plugged 150mg, for completeness sake, to finish my 500mg. Oops! all gone in 3 hours. I did an allergy dose yesterday so keep your smart-ass comments to yourselves.


So any physical analysis will have to wait I'm afraid!


I did feel that plugged dose but it was just mild, and probably wasteful. Spraying up the nose seems good.


I will need to start off with a solid 200-300mg dose next time. My dissociative tolerance does not help.

So those of you experiencing damaged noses, I don't think it's a chemical effect you're experiencing, it would seem to be mechanical damage. Try spraying a solution, or lining your nose with water first.

Yeah, I am unable to say if it's weak or not due to my tolerance. But I didn't get that much off it. I suspect my tolerance is a big part of it.


People, **line your noses with water. Snort some water before snorting the N-E(N)K.** As far as I can tell, and I've snorted about 300mg, this drug, or at least the batch I have a sample of, is **not** chemically corrosive, it's just the crystalline structure that's fucking with your membranes. It would be useful for someone without dissociative tolerance to take this advice and report.


Perhaps some fool might IM it. Maybe that fool will be me when I get some more.

**N-ethyl-Ketamine -  just ordered 500mg + share you experiences with me, is this good?**


Some say its bad, some say its better than mxe (which I find impossible to believe because mxe will always be my favorite drug)..


Whats your take on it?, did I just waste my money buying this, whats the dosage to K hole??

Don't think it's your tolerance^


I have NO tolerance at all, and a line of 150mg + some lines an hour earlier of about 50mg each, didn't gave me that much.

This is very concerning, given that 150mg of methyl-norketamine ("ketamine") will blast most people into space, and ethyl substitution is meant to *increase* potency.

Someone needs to have this shit analysed pronto, by a 3rd party

Can anyone make a guess at the metabolism of n-ethyl-norketamine? CYP2B6 seems to be the main enzyme responsible for demethylation - would it also  de-ethylate n-ethyl-norketamine?


I'm just wondering why there are a few reports of oral ROA being successful floating around...

thanks. certainly very enlightening...


Having just done 150mg oral (gelcap) and finally getting some sort of response (after trying sub lingual and insufflation without much joy... but a lot of pain with the latter!) I can say I finally got some sort of dissociative experience... but it was very short and sharp... 30 mins at most? and far short of what Ive experienced on MXE and Ket.

Just got some today and did a 5mg allergy test about an hour ago. Snorted another 25mg about half an hour ago and I really don't understand what people are complaining about with nose pain. I didn't dilute it in water, or snort water beforehand and while it does sting a bit for 5 seconds, it's no worse than Ketamine. I was doing s-isomer k last night so I'm sure my tolerance is up right now but I actually noticed the 25mg; very slightly but I feel more wonky than I should for sure and I wouldn't really expect to feel much if anything from a 25mg dose of Ketamine. 


Won't do any more for a few days and let my tolerance subside a bit and then will try a 75mg dose; usually how much I take with pure s-isomer k, and work my way up to a 150-200mg dose to attempt holing. Only ordered 2 grams so I will probably use an entire gram figuring out nasal doses, and then might use the other gram for oral and rectal experiments.

One way: Make a pile, put a sheet of paper on top and crush it by, for example, rolling an R20/D battery over it. Remove the paper, make sure you've not left chemical on the paper. Take a card, e.g. credit card - and, pressing down hard, swipe the powder across your surface. Then scrape it up with a blade and chop it.


You can also use a pestle and mortar, it crushes it very effectively, but you can sometimes lose drugs in the rough surface of the mortar. Some mortars have a rougher finish than others. If you have lots of drugs then it's not so big an issue, and you can recover most of the powder with a spatula.


Or make a solution and use that.

thanks... I enjoyed the battery idea. Especially as I read that initially as using R2D2 ![:-)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


not entirely sure about the credit card bit... are you using that as a scraper across the surface of the paper, or as another crushing implement?


my only suggestion as to improve the above advice might be to use something less porous than paper... acetate perhaps?

You wouldn't get fuck all from doing 100mg sublingual Ketamine either so that's not really saying a whole lot.

not to be smart but thats a double negative so Im not sure what your point is? 


anyway, I never said I was doing 100mg ket sublingual (only ever insufflated personally)... I was referencing my preferred ROA for MXE (dont you just hate all these acronyms?)

well its not just the site iv guessed at iv just found out this now seems to be more universal problem with the substance unless one is supplying the other . and when i found out as to who the other one is it really looks like its the chemical that could be of poor quality not just the vendor

I'm not seeing how that's a double negative? Haha no worries I'm not upset ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png) What I mean is that the pharmacology of NEK is very similar to that of Ketamine from my understanding anyway; so you saying that you didn't get fuck all from doing 100mg of NEK sublingually doesn't mean very much to me as it should almost be expected. 


I agree sublingual is my favourite ROA for MXE but chemically NEK is quite a bit further away from MXE than Ketamine so I wouldn't expect the same actions from NEK as MXE. Of course it's not a bad thing to try it out, but doesn't quite make sense to write off a chemical simply because one ROA isn't effective; ESPECIALLY if one of the closest known compounds also isn't very effective through that ROA. (lol yeah the acronyms get pretty ridiculous at times, but I'm far to lazy to write the full chemical name each time)


IM and nasal are the most effective ROA's for Ketamine, correct? So I would expect the same to be the case with NEK. Personally I didn't find the burn of 25mg nasally to be any worse than Ketamine so as long as the burn doesn't increase exponentially when I snort 100mg, I still see NEK as a viable Ketamine replacement, as long as the effects are similar. I will update on how my experimentation went once I've given my tolerance some time to subside; probably Friday this week.

I should have 250mg arriving either tomorrow or the day after. I have been reading the thread however I am still a little confused on how I should take it, and have a few questions. 


**What would be most effective, snorting or oral? **


Another think that I would like to know is, when people are talking about snorting water I don't really understand how this should be done. Should I put a straw into a glass of water then breathe it in through my nose? Or put water on the end of my finger then breathe it in that way?


Really thanks aloy!

Exactly this. Credit card, smooth flat surface, press, or even press and drag smearing the stuff out for some extra friction and grinding action to avoid clumping, credit card vertical, chop. Job done. ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

Can't tell you I'm afraid, if it's anything like ketamine, though, then oral is a waste of time drug.

You can do either of those, or if you have a syringe, suck some water up and spray it up there. Without a needle attached of course! You could also use a squeezy bottle of some kind, or just anything to get water inside your nasal cavity and make it moist.


It's actually more comfortable to spray / squirt water up your nostril than to snort it up, as you don't really want to get water in your throat or lungs.

I have an eyedropper so I can use that. And also I will cut the powder down as much as I can with a knife.


**Can anyone comment on what would be the more efficient RoA: Insufflated or oral?**


I am only getting 250mg so I would like that to last as much as it can... hopefully a good few sessions. The other thing is that I have 4g MXE arriving about the same so how about combining them? Can anyone recommend a good dose combination? I usually sniff 100mg MXE, however I don't think the purity is as great as the stuff I could get pre-ban. I'm unsure if I have tolerance or not, I go always go through around 3-4g in maybe 2 weeks or so, but then wait a week before ordering more.

If you read the thread the verdict is insufflated is best - this cmpd is basically the same as, or worse than ketamine potency wise

I think when I get a chance to do this I'm going to bite the bullet and IM this one. I've had K two times in my life overall and only once was I able to hole nasally and that was my first diss. experience besides DXM, for instance. The other time I split two sessions up with around 1.5g's and while totally a blast, was somehow unable to hole even though I blasted a 500mg line up right away/etc and the second time I went right for 500-600 leaving a bit left for later and still no hole. Then, I had saved around 200mgs to IM which I did and obviously was holed out this world. So when I get a chance to get "EK" which is coming from the most "reputable"vendor I could find for something like this I think i'm going to IM it straight away as to not waste it because i'll probably only have maybe a two gram supply at max.  Plus ket ruined my nose and I crushed the fuck out of the crystals and do not by any means have a sensitive nose either so... 


Anyways with all that out of the way and having read Adder/everyone elses assesments here of supposed "EK", I figure to be safe i'll start with 25-50mgs as well maybe lower for the first test shot, then work up. I may end up trying it nasally as well but I already know I prefer my diss' IM and like stated haven't been able to source a ton of ket, from this supposed's vendors NMR/etc that of course they'll provide its supposed to be 98.5% purity of his batch so heres to hoping that its actually valid EK and is 98% but does everyone find this route advisable? I don't think i've seen anyone yet IM this "EK" yet and everyones complaining already about their noses, lol...... I remember last time from just those two sessions of nasal ket my nose was ravaged and I like saving my nose as best I can.

Experiences follow others - substance was procured from a previously highly reliable vendor. It was tried twice, firstly at 50mg + 150mg 30 mins later, then subsequently 24 hours later 250mg + 150mg 30 mins later, both intranasal.


The effects were broadly similar to ketamine, approximately the same duration, but much less disabling. I was able to type, albeit slowly, quite soon after the "peak", and locomotion was much less impaired. At no time was I approaching anything like "hole" dose, and I am normally able to achieve a hole with ketamine at around 150mg intranasal. The experiences was much less confusing and much more clear headed, even with eyes closed on the biggest doses, I was only slightly physically dissociated from my limbs and immediate surroundings. There were no closed eye "visuals" to speak of really. Duration was similar if a bit shorter than ketamine.


I finely crushed the powder before use, and although it was somewhat unpleasant to snort, it was no worse than ketamine. Certainly no nose bleeds, pain for days etc. 


Dosing was a problem though - the powder was so fine and flyaway, and apparently not very dense - 50mg looked like much bigger amount than 50 mg of ketamine, so there was a LOT of powder to snort. On the second trial, towards the end of the 250mg I was trying to snort all at once, I was definitely overshooting - i.e. inhaling the powder straight up int the back of my throat. I felt that there may have been a slight increase in intensity approx 30 mins afterwards, which *might* have been due to oral absorption, but hard to tell. There was a slight reduction in potency between session 1 and session 2, so some minor tolerance.


About the only positive was that the experience felt more positive than ketamine, which can be pretty neutral and/or dark for me sometimes. My mood was elevated with mild euphoria throughout, and post peak I was very intellectually productive, stimulated and able to order my thoughts coherently - unlike ketamine, where any intellectual insights tend to be impaired and fractured.


Until it it's resolved whether Adder's experience was atypical, or in fact the substance is of low purity, I have no real desire to try this again.

i am starting with a allergy test. but i do not see the point in starting with a messy and painful ROA for my first experience when i could be using a more efficient method. in general i believe the dangers of IMing stem from mistaken dosing and the procedure being carried out improperly. 

which is obviously why i am asking about what dose to start with. 

i have wide experience with IMing ketamine at all dose levelsso i do not believe (judging from reports) that i will be overwhelmed by a low-moderate dose of N-EK.

what other danger were you referring to? if i've missed a different good safety point then i will follow your advice and start with a nasal dose

I didn't think of any concrete dangers; but nasal consume has the benefit that one can easily increase the dosage in several steps, which is IMHO a good thing when experimenting with new drugs.


but I do understand your point, and I am looking forward to hear your report. regarding the dosage: despite initial hopes, I would say that it is roughly equipotent to regular racemic ketamine, so you can use your ketamine experiences as dosage guide.

Well like stated even with IM I can titrate the dose as far as 1mg if I want to for an AT/all that. No one is sure "EK" really even exists afterall all I have my hopes as does everyone else, it probably does since people are reporting diss activity different but similar to actual ket which means its something though who knows how impure it could end up being. Mine will come will results/etc that say its 98.5 pure which given the vendors rep seems pretty okay because he had 2-MeO-Ket as well and admitted it was part of the impure synth and all that, he even had it stated but I can't remember those figures currently. I only want to try it IM right off the bat for the stated reasons in my post others can follow if they know the risks but I have clean whatman micron filters/fresh 1 inch BD 25's ready to go off the bat so!

**N-eK - no tolerance to Ket or mxe, low dose test-run -**


Okay, bit brief but just to add my initial experiments to this thread.


1mg of N-EK as tongued as an allergy test. This miniscule amount was not ground, just a couple of teeny crystals but I could feel it under my tongue, gently rotting away the inside of my mouth lol


A few hours later, despite all the reports I ground 10mg into the finest possible powder & administered it carefully up on nostril. Small amount, nasty pain. Reminds me of my past mistakes with 2c-c & 4-fa. No lasting damage was noted however (unlike with 4-fa) other than a blocked nose. No effect was established, nor expected at this level.


Again, a few hours later 25mg was dissolved in a cuppa & swallowed. Once again, no obvious effect.


Back to the drawing board then . . .


A couple days later I weighed 50mg & ground it heavilly on my mirror. This fine dust was then pored into a small bottle with four drops of water. The solution was the droppered onto a mirror & I managed to snort the concotion into my nostrils. This was STILL a wee bit unpleasant. It stung (but not like the undiluted 10mg) & felt a bit uncomfortable at the back of my throat as it dripped, kinda scratchy, like the beginnings of a sore throat.


Effects appeared within 5 minutes however. They were pretty gentle. Subtle light hadspace, possible visual disturbance, vaguely raised mood, posibly. Sneezing & coughing (scratchy feeling in upper chest, & sneezing suggest possible ellergic reaction as I suffer from asthma & general allergies) punctuated the experience. Headspace eased within 30 minutes & was non-existant by the time an hour had passed. A slight headache appeared but didn't last more than half hour, probable unconnected to experiment.


I like Ket but havent had any in a few years. I don't hole & enjoyed my K mostly along with Meph. I like MXE too, but again, havent used any in months & never take heroic doses anyway. I have pretty close to zero tolerance to dissacociatves of any kind & in fact, very few chems have been used in recent months.


I've always had high sensitvity to pretty much all compounds from MDMA to shrooms, valium & eti to coke & booze. So, apart from a daily weed intake, I've got a nice clean screen to look at this stuff. I'm also not chasing any highs such as those produced by Ket & Mxe & I'm taking N-eK at face value.


I'll be moving up to, I dunno, maybe 75mg, possibly 100mg next time but it'll be a week or so as I want my screen all cleaned up before I try again. Combining this wth low dose mxe (my favourite dosing for mxe) will also be considered.

IMed this substance is peculiar. 

I was unco-ordinated in a manner extremely similar to ketamine and even got a fair blow of ketamine visuals. Some anaesthesia was present.

In my head however, it was a different story.

It just wasn't convincing, there was no mental change so far as i could tell. there was no involvement, no psychedelic pull. I was just sat there, feeling these feelings.


It was the difference between going on a rollercoaster and going on a rollercoaster simulator

Update - 36 hours after my second usage, I had three spontaneous nosebleeds over about a 7 or 8 hour period. I *never* get nosebleeds, and these were proper dribbling-blood-all-over-the-desk affairs that came out of nowhere. Bizarre, as I had very finely crushed the powder and it felt no worse than ketamine, and I had no bleeding at the time.


Won't be touching this compound again.

I doubt it, although i never had full on dripping nosebleeds i did have a tendency to blow my nose quite regularly and there was quite a bit of blood, not sure what the stuff is doing inside your nose to make it happen but it certainly must be something damaging to have this sort of reaction.


Anyways, a disappointing RC and probably quite harmful one aswell,


Maybe the huge hype just made it even more disappointing?


I can definatley see this stuff dying a quick death.

I've had K two times in my life overall and only once was I able to hole nasally and that was my first diss. experience besides DXM, for instance. The other time I split two sessions up with around 1.5g's and while totally a blast, was somehow unable to hole even though I blasted a 500mg line up right away/etc and the second time I went right for 500-600 leaving a bit left for later and still no hole. Then, I had saved around 200mgs to IM which I did and obviously was holed out this world. So when I get a chance to get "EK" which is coming from the most "reputable"vendor I could find for something like this I think i'm going to IM it straight away as to not waste it because i'll probably only have maybe a two gram supply at max.  Plus ket ruined my nose and I crushed the fuck out of the crystals and do not by any means have a sensitive nose either so...

> 
> Anyways with all that out of the way and having read Adder/everyone elses assesments here of supposed "EK", I figure to be safe i'll start with 25-50mgs as well maybe lower for the first test shot, then work up. I may end up trying it nasally as well but I already know I prefer my diss' IM and like stated haven't been able to source a ton of ket, from this supposed's vendors NMR/etc that of course they'll provide its supposed to be 98.5% purity of his batch so heres to hoping that its actually valid EK and is 98% but does everyone find this route advisable? I don't think i've seen anyone yet IM this "EK" yet and everyones complaining already about their noses, lol...... I remember last time from just those two sessions of nasal ket my nose was ravaged and I like saving my nose as best I can.

If yer gonna IM please filter well.  I found that after dissolving even with heat there was a fair bit of residue left at the bottom and the surface was left covered in a chalky substance.  Also the solution was very cloudy before filtration.

What concentration were you aiming for? Can you weigh the filter (next time you ever do a shot of it) before and after to see how much shit you trap?


This kind of makes me think that N-ethylnorketamine is actually more potent than K but people have cut it with fucking silica or something. Invisible to GC/HPLC, irritating to nasal mucosa, doesn't dissolve.

to verify your theory, I just tried to dissolve about one gram ethylketamine in approximately 100 ml tap water. it completely dissolved with a little stirring; the resulting solution had a very slight yellowish coloring.

Did you get the batch cut with silica?

No - just the one cut with strychnine!

The N-Ethyl-Norketamine will dissolve so you can dose it properly...

Why would this be a waste? The substance is still existent.

-

So I gathered that this one is not that nose friendly as the original. Other preferred ROAs without the risk of bleedings and tissue damage?

Well, after this trial I tried 75mg followed by 25mg within about half any hour. Again I diluted it in a few drops of tap water & snorted it off a mirror. This time I spent longer grinding the powder, & despite the larger dose I suffered less pain & irritation. I did still suffer an unpleasantly blocked nose, throught the night & into the next day.


The high sadly was nothing to get excited about. This is like Ket without any recreational value. There's little if any psychedelia, just a light headspace typical of this class of compounds but exceptionally short-lived & strangely hollow, pointless. My sample has run out & I see no reason to restock.

I wanted to test sekios hypothesis of ethylketamine being cut with something not solvable in water. I did it in a quick&dirty way without measuring. after I saw that my material was completely water-solvable, I just boiled the water off and had my ethylketamine back.

About 40mg/ml IIRC, certainly no more than 45mg/ml.  Ketamine appears to have a solubility around 200mg/ml so if NEK has similar solubility then it appears that I had very impure product.  All gone now so can't test and won't be reordering as it's not really my thing.

I was thinking that it was made for IM injection, hence 1 gram per 10ml. I wonder if it would stay in suspension at 1gram per 10ml. MXE and Ket do.

despite the majority of people having bad/non experiences coupled with nose bleeds I'm amazed at everyones persistence to KEEP on trying this despite the mounting evidence that its a BAD DRUG. (I too had the worst nose bleeds and blocked nose for days, maybe best part of a week and no effect on trying this...this is the first dissociative I have ever brought and managed to NOT TAKE IT ALL  and leave it).....

How do you know people are doing the same thing over and over again? I wasn't, I took steadily increasing doses, I first used it as a "spray" in solution, I then sniffed it "dry" onto a well moistened nasal cavity. I was doing one different thing after another, and was expecting (and got) pretty much the same result ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif) ![:p](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png) Apparently it's a different story when combined with MXE though...


PS I avoided a nosebleed until my final test, which was about half a gram powder sniffed after lining my nose with water. Felt fine at the time, then the next day my nose was blocked - felt all swollen inside. Then the day after that, the blockage cleared, and I got a very small nosebleed.


I almost never get nosebleeds, but on the other hand I almost never sniff 500mg of drugs.

11 pages of people saying "I took more and more and nothing happened, I got a nose bleed though" compared to, say for example, the MXE mega threads of delusional ranting by people who are trashed off their faces.


 re my above post, I continued to try different more extreme and desperate sounding ROA's.


in the end i found that by drilling a hole in the top of my head and pouring in the whole baggy and using a finger (or two, hell next time I will just fist my brain) I experienced a slight lift in mood with some minor visual disturbances.


(Seriously, It occurred to me to add to my post that in the interest of harm reduction, if people are taking a drug that seems to be causing a lot of nose bleeds, DO NOT share straws/snorters... its a slim chance, but much the same as dirty needles, if your sticking a note or a straw up your bloody nose, then passing a to and from  a friend during a session, who may have done the same to someone else who has done it with someone else....etc etc that Hep and HIV etc could be spread...just if its causing nose bleeds anything like i experienced I had blood coming out with chunks and snot for days...something I wouldnt really want to pass on to someone else)

^ the MXE thread was mostly full of people talking shit. People on decent K find better things to do than type..


its worth remembering that not all drug users use bluelight, one of the major vendors has sold out once already, so somebody must like it.

Personally i am reserving judgement for a couple of weeks, apparently this has been made in china, but there is a batch being prepared in the EU....i'll probably wait for that. Nothing against china, just possible the nose bleeds are due to a bad batch.

Haha.  We're only a few weeks into this "period of interest" in NEK. Maybe some people are using it in "insane" ways, but others are just trying to establish it's properties (so far, "a bit like weak ketamine"). I think those people who took more and more and got blood for their efforts were mostly just not doing it properly ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

As far as I understand from my research, intranasal is 3-4x more efficient than rectal or oral with Ketamine. Erowid doesn't say anything about sublingual and I've had a hard time finding much info on it anywhere as no one seems to want to try it.


[http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/ketamine/ketamine_dose.shtml](http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/ketamine/ketamine_dose.shtml)


Anyway, I did end up doing more NEK this last Friday and have some good news! I weighed out 500mg into a bag as I didn't plan to consume any more than that throughout the night. I crushed it up very fine just like I do with Ketamine and shared about 200mg of it through the night, and I ended up doing about 300mg of it throughout the night. I didn't get any nosebleeds whatsoever but my nose was definitely stuffed for a bit, but I also caught the cold that night so I'm not sure if the stuffed nose was primarily from the NEK or from being sick, or whether getting sick had anything to do with NEK. 


Anyways, on to the interesting stuff; I definitely holed! Felt VERY much like Ketamine to me as I remember getting very wonky and warm, and then I basically don't remember 45 minutes of what I was doing but my friends tell me I was doing some pretty ridiculous shit; just like every time I've holed on racemic or s-isomer Ketamine. Apparently at one point I sat there holding a Subway sub just staring into it for a good 20 minutes, unable to speak, but obviously very hungry, probably unsure of how to go about chewing it. And that was after I had peaked from the hole already. I remember doing at least 4-5 lines throughout the night which equated to about 300mg in total, and that is pretty much just as much, if not less than I would need to hole on pure s-isomer Ketamine. 


I think some of you have been too quick to write off this chemical. I really don't understand how so many of you have been getting ridiculous nosebleeds; have you ever done Ketamine? I think I do agree that this compound is slightly rougher on the 'ole shnaz than Ketamine, but not by very much at all. I will definitely try mixing some water with my rails next time I have the time to try this compound out as I could certainly see how that would help. Personally I've never IM'd anything and don't really plan on it but I could certainly see that being an extremely viable ROA for this compound and would love to see some more reports of it being IM'd.


Oh and also, the 200mg I shared with friends was split between 2 different people and they both said they got quite wonky from it and said they both enjoyed themselves quite a bit. Most of my friends and myself have dissociative tolerances as we've been doing Methoxetamine pretty much since it's been out; with moderation of course. We also do Ketamine every now and then, and have tried 3-MeO-PCP and 4-MeO-PCP on a few different occasions.

Well I'll be damned. Congratulations! Shame you don't remember the hole though. Maybe it's my general disso tolerance and not the potency of NEK that's keeping the hole elusive for me, it's been a while since I've done ket too, maybe that wouldn't work for me either. MXE barely works, but I always felt that my MXE abuse hadn't really affected my ketamine tolerance. Must have fucked it up all round for me.

yeah...this suff works.

it has already been said that if ketamine = 10 then this = 7.

that pretty much sums it up.


i felt some anxiety and resisted it, not sure if that is because its an RC [ i usually get a bit edgy when trying a RC for the first time ] or if thats due to the drug having a slightly more stimulating edge to it


I suspect its a bit of both.


so, in a nut shell, shorter duration, less visual, possibly more stimulating.


in a blind test i could deffo tell the two apart.


but its not 'shit' or 'weak', still needs to be respected


ps - when i say 'stimulating' i'm not refering to heart rate...i mean i felt more comfortable moving and dancing than laying down...

although this may seem a positive post i think i'll add my name to the list of people that, having tried it probably wont get anymore. It didnt burn much more than ketamine but i can already feel the cold-like symptoms people have mentioned


ps - have experience, but no tolerance, hope this post is of some use 

over and out


as for the 'hole' i dont really know, I never went looking for the hole on K, i just fell down it because re-dosing felt so nice....this wasnt the case with NEK...it didnt bring out the fiend in me

A real report for people who IM it or want to IM it. 


First off, this stuff will suspend just fine at 1gram in 10ml of bacteriostatic water filetered with a .20u watman filter. I had 3 grams of it and made 30ml of it just fine.


Second, with all the reports of people trying do use it up their nose and having problems, I can see why. You have to do too much of this stuff at first and to keep going if you use your nose. Theres no point in it. Just put it in a needle and go IM, the only way to go. I'm not even going to talk about plugging it cause I think it's stupid and again, IM is the best way to go.


Took 60mg IM first time to try it out. Haven't done real K in over a year, haven't done MXE in over 6 months. No tolerance to either. Layed doen on the couch listning to vlcaol trance music with headphones on with a towel over my eyes hoping for CEV's like K and MXE did to me. I felt that this first shot of only 60mg took a loooong time to come on and really didn't do much but made me feel a little drunk. No big deal. 


Took 150mg IM about 15 mins later. For the person that said they felt it was like a rollercoaster that just never got there, they are right. I felt it come on, and I did get CEV's, but no textured rooms like K and no vibrant greens or reds. I got fractals of purple and black space with stars moving like the starfield simulator on Windows PC screensaver. It didn't last long though. 


Took another 100mg after this and the CEV's were almost there. I liek to "build" cityscapes like in that move Inception when I was on K or MXE. I would build the city while flying over it and then zoom in on it like you can in Google Earth. Worked really well on MXE and K but all I could do was build a "dark" city on this 3rd shot and the light in the buildings were dim red. Thats it.


Every shot after this didn't do anything more for the CEV's and pretty soon I just saw black, as I felt I reached "saturation" dose, and any more dosing wouldn't do anything beneficial.


The one think I like about it is that it doesn't have that "mass confusion" part that MXE had. It also wears off very quick and it's easy to just go to bed, I was actually very tired in the end.


I have no URGE to want to do it again, so I will jsut save it for a one day on the weekend thing. There is no afterglow of good feelings the next day, which tells me it doesn't jack your dopamine up like MXE did, hench the antidepressant effect that MXE gave. I just feel normal.


It is what it is and nothing more. I can't see them wanting to ban this one as it just doesn't have the unpredicatlble effects that too much K or MXE has. In fact, it is very predicatable, and once you reach a "saturation" point, theres no point in doing it anymore.


Agian, IM is the only way to go.

After a month of abstinence from dissociatives, gave this a try. Doses at 125mg, then 180mg, then 250mg with a high NMDA tolerance.


I expected to enjoy the compound a great deal more than I do, and the potency is lower than anticipated. There's something up-front and pleasant about the euphoria, but the physical side effects that feel like sinus tension make it uncomfortable in my view. Very short-lived, which has its benefits of course, and I imagine that IM is a more practical ROA, but I don't use needles, for better or worse.


Edit:

Also wanted to add my experience with the insufflation of it:

It really isn't that hard on the hooter if it's properly crushed. And by crushed I mean absolutely decimated as any chemical should be for greater uptake efficiency. Prepare your snuzzle with some water and you'll avoid unnecessary bleeding ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Got 250mg today, tried it out slowly wasnt very impressed.


Anyway my right Kidney has a dull ache to it, iv not got this off Ketamine before and iv drunkj a fair amount of water, but can't seem to piss.  My left kidney dosnt hurt at all.


Little bit worried if im honest.


I have had this pain from very heavy drinking once or twice but not for a while.  But not as bad as this.

Wow, I can't believe people keep ordering and trying this stuff.  It seems very clear from this thread that what people are getting is NOT n-ethyl-norketamine.  It's most likely a bad synthesis.  Everyone should look up Adder's thread, when he made a bunch of different arylcyclohexylamine analogs and tested them.  I have much more faith that he synthesized them correctly, than some shady vendor.  He reported that it was more potent than Ketamine, which makes sense looking at the rest of the SAR.


Reports of bleeding noses for days!?  Kidney ache and can't seem to pee?  Something is definitely wrong here.  I bet when the first GCMS comes in, it turns out it's a bad synth with a bunch of unreacted precursors or something.  Buyer beware...

Well put, Knockando. 


I have a fair tolerance to K and MXE, but I still think this NEK stuff is alright. Bottom line for me: It's too expensive. 


Having said that, what I tried was good. Clean feeling effect, short-acting, wears off smoothly, easy to handle (not overwhelming or mania-inducing), enjoyable.

I've waited long enough for him to reply. I asked a well known vendor for NEK if I could see his NMR and I go this response. I replied assuring him that my intentions were noble but he refused to reply:

It's most likely a bad synthesis.  Everyone should look up Adder's thread, when he made a bunch of different arylcyclohexylamine analogs and tested them.  I have much more faith that he synthesized them correctly, than some shady vendor.  He reported that it was more potent than Ketamine, which makes sense looking at the rest of the SAR.

This is not the first substance to not match adders report in it's actual effects. That report was a bunch of SAR speculation, not reality. Sorry.


That being said, there is equally no reason to believe that this stuff is as it is being sold. This vendor does have a pretty good track record, but that's about it.  Garbage from all angles if you ask me!

I strongly disagree here. I have much more faith in one of the most reliable RC vendors of all times than in Adder's thread. Adder also claimed that 2-Meo-Ketamine was about the same potency as ketamine, which turned out to be wrong.

CannibalSnail, the style of that reply looks vaguely familiar. Might even be able to make an educated guess who and where it came from, **J**ust have to be super careful with the sourcing rule and even the subtlest of hints? ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)  What would you expect him to say? A reasonably articulate and knowledgeable scammer could say very nearly as much, except for the solid reputation built over time as a reliable, knowledgeable prime mover in the UK of a supplier who's goods have always been exactly as stated on the tin, why would he get this one chemical / name wrong all of a sudden, deliberately or otherwise? If it's who I think it is and he says the GC/MS / NMRs are good I'm inclined to believe him.

I noticed while reading through the thread, that you seemed to have a more expected experience than most people on here.  Possibly the stuff you're getting is better quality.  When you read some of these posts, I maintain it does seem very clear that there is something wrong with some people's "N-Ethyl-Norketamine".  I guess it's possible that lengthening one chain from a methyl to an ethyl could cause mega nose bleeds, problems peeing (to be fair, not exclusive to n-ethyl-norketamine), big drop in potency, but it just doesn't make sense.  Why would it become super caustic to the nose when nothing else with a similar chemical structure is?  It doesn't follow pcm -> pce, MXE, etc, either.  Also, people (e.g. Nicklazz) mentioning 200mg doses without much disassociation, no tolerance at all? 


You're right, the final proof is in the experiment, but a bunch of people using a chemical they randomly sourced with no data on it's purity other than a guy saying "it's good, trust me" isn't "the scientific method".


Don't get me wrong, I've mused on this exact chemical for years, hoping to try it some day.  It just doesn't seem right to me.

The nose bleeds are **mechanical**, not chemical, or *perhaps* they are occurring in particularly sensitive people, but the first explanation is simpler. As I said above, I got the tiniest nose bleed, a trace of blood in my snot, after I'd sniffed 500mg of the drug in one short sitting (2 hours), that's a lot of powder, and that was after several days of sniffing slightly smaller doses - 300mg, 200mg, after which I'd had absolutely no problems with my nose. Same could have happened with all manner of non-corrosive chemicals.


I avoided trouble by wetting my nasal cavity. Others seem to have avoided irritation by using very thorough crushing techniques.

Technically no, but many places are (incorrectly) using that name to refer to N-Ethyl-norketamine (NENK)

Ok. So I've read over a few posts. A lot of people say its no good. Lot of worrying side effects eg can't pee? Wtf? Doesn't last long, etc. Is it worth the price?

Having followed this thread from early on I'd say that it's not good and it's not worth the price. Either it's a shit drug or it's an appalling batch.

Anyone tried combining this with anything to make it better?


i rarely do K alone and my favorite part about mxe was to combine with stuff like dmt or lsd to get a dissiotated trip so to speak.


Im thinking this might be bland by itself but might be useful to ramp up trip or something.


Also anyone tried this with 3/4 meo pcp?  might be make for a mxe kind of trip by combing these.

Yes, I have. I'm more cautious of combinations with 3-MeO-PCP because it has some very powerful interactions, but so far so good.


In fact "so far" I'm reserving judgement on N-EK until I've had the opportunity to test it again in a more useful way. My tolerance is substantial due to previous long-term abuse of K/MXE (that tolerance never seems to go away even after months), and I expect my receptor tolerance is shortening the duration and changing the effect profile. My first testing of N-EK on top of a reasonably mild 3-MeO dose resulted in more intensity of effects than N-EK alone.


Note: Not recommended for reasons of safety - the manic, thrashing 3-MeO-'hole' is dangerous enough on its own and it's very easy to get there with the smallest mistake. But if you use 3-MeO already I'm preaching to the choir!


I think N-EK is irritant much like MXE seemed to be, and it does have some character of what feels like a PH burn, but I'd echo knockando's comments -  I think the heavy bleeding is mechanical. After a thorough crushing and making sure there's a bit of water lining the nose, no such problems.

This is NENK from an invite only EU vendor and can be seen on their safe or scam page. It indicates a very high level of purity. The analyser commented

Rather off-topic but I must ask... This researcher has posted here NMR's of other substances but I can't find them. Can you please point me to them by telling me his username on BL? His SOS username (which according to him is the same as the one here) is only a number for me because I don't have an account on that site (SOS)!


Now back to the topic... This EU vendor changed the name of the compound from the incorrect N-Ethyl-Ketamine that many other vendors are using to the correct N-Ethyl-Norketamine after I contacted him regarding the matter; I pointed them to this thread and they subsequently consulted with their chemist, who replied thus:


*"You are selling N-Ethyl-Norketamine. The tertiary amine N-Ethyl-Ketamine is probably inactive since basically all the known Arylcyclohexylamines are sec-amines. BTW, 'NOR' is from the German 'N ohne Radikal', which means 'N without radical' and usually refers to a demethylated compound. It can also mean the loss of a different alkyl residue, though. There has been a large discussion on Bluelight where people (rightly) criticized the use of the name N-Ethyl-Ketamine. You should probably change that."*

I would be very surprised if the new vendor was not selling the same batch as the vendors already selling this compound.

I gave in and purchased half a gram from what I believe to be one of the more reputable vendors, even though it is double the price of ketamine. I haven't been able to source the latter for the last 2 months and have not used mxe much in the meantime so I hope my resistance is down to a level where this will provide me a worthwhile experience at 50mg.


Heh, after reading the above posts I positive it's coming from the same place you guys are familiar with. I have extensive experience with mxe and ketamine and I'll provide my opinion on it if interested.

The reliable EU vendor who has it in the inventory now is this the real deal?

And is it worth the money?

What did the NMR say that was allready erased on SOS?

A friend analysed the NMR and although he was a bit rusty he said the proton count was 1 off but he thought this was due to hydrogens on the amine not being counted. If this is correct then this is the real deal. The NMR of 3-FA was also 2 protons off from expected, supporting his interpretation.

the original vendor from the UK offerin ethylketamine is *at least as* reputable as the vendor that has started offering recently, and that's why I bet you dollars to donuts that both vendors are selling the same compound at the same high purity.

My girlfriend and I snorted our way through almost all of the half gram that I acquired on Saturday. It really isn't at all bad on the nose if you crush it up really finely and snort some water first. Snorting wasn't entirely pain free and my nose ran a little, but the next day our sinuses where completely fine - no blockage, certainly no blood.


As for effects, it got a resounding meh from both of us. It is an active dissociative drug with effects broadly similar to ketamine, but the amount you have to shove up your nose to get anything approximating a satisfying high is ridiculous. My last dose was 110mg in three fat lines and I really thought something was going to happen for a few minutes there, but an hour later I was pretty much back to baseline. Someone said in this thread that that it might be a perfectly serviceable drug for people looking for a wonk rather than a hole, and I don't disagree with that. But you can get a longer lasting and more satisfying wonk out of any of the other available arylcyclohexylamines out there. If you seriously can't get anything better, then go for it. At least you can be sure that you won't accidentally hole.


At 1 AM after hoovering up over two hundred milligrams of this compound and being sober in every way (apart from a slight beer-buzz) I treated myself to ten milligrams of 3-MeO-PCP and declared N-Ethyl-Norketamine pointless. My girlfriend was asleep and my pronouncement went unheard, so here I am with my unsolicited opinion. When someone comes on here claiming that NENK is their favourite dissociative I'll believe that there are better batches out there than the one I sampled. Until then I'll stick to the opinion that it's just a very mild drug.

To what end? If you're comboing with a dissociative capable of producing a hole the NEK would be redundant anyways wouldn't it, particularly at the doses people are having to take of it to get anything much from it at all? Not what I'd call much of a potentiator here by all accounts.

^ Agreed. I doubt that if you were under the effects of any stronger dissociative you'd be able to tell what the NENK was adding. It would just get lost in the mix. Why not just take a little more of the stronger stuff? NENK doesn't seem to have any special character of it's own, it's just like ket that's been cut to hell and back.

well for example when i combine 3meopcp and mxe i get into a hole like state that i cannot achive with either alone,

also a favorite combo of mine dxm+ketamine produces a dissociation distinctly difrent than either dxm or ket alone

so  thats kinda what i had in mind?

^ I get what you're saying, but I really don't think it'd work. N-Ethyl-Norketamine is just so much weaker and milder than any of the compounds you've mentioned. Maybe you can't hole on 3-MeO-PCP or MXE  alone, but I bet you can get pretty satisfyingly fucked on either, right? NENK barely touches the sides. I guess it might add a little to the dxm experience, as dxm is so different from the arylcyclohexlamines that you might be able to discern the added effect from the NENK. But I doubt it would be any different from dxm+ketamine except that you'd have to snort more powder for the same effect.


If you can get any other ketamine analogue this stuff is pretty pointless. If you can get ketamine itself it is *completely* pointless. Except of course to add a one substance to the list of shit you've tried.

if this realy is the case and this is a extremly weak substance are the vendors going to be able to sell it at this insane price ? 

has anyone tested the cheaper source? is it the same batch ?

I don't trust myself wth the MeO-PCPs pontifex. I've had greedy runs on MXE dosing way more than was good for me going in and out of the hole. Think that would be most unwise on the PCPs. Was hoping NENK would allow for some revisiting of the MXE headspace but alas seems I'd be wasting my dosh on it, and don't have K available ( and don't generally do illegals beyond a bit of weed these days ) so that's out. Bummer!

NEK is pretty worthless. you  only feel a nice wonk and the shifting and twitching beyond 150mg ... i needed 250mg for a feeling thats about the same than 40mg MXE or 50mg K would give. and yeah, my nose was bloody and blocked like during a cold the next day, even tho i grounded up properly and used NaCl spray upfront to wetten my nose.


i also tried to combine with MXE and kept the MXE dose very low at 30mg because i knew that MXE will overpronounce NEK. and it certainly did. the only think NEK is good for is, if you wanna feel the body shifts and twists and dont wanna push MXE up too far then 30mg MXE (for a basic nice mellow dissociation) and about 100+mg NEK will do.


i never holed on NEK alone yet hat the feeling to be anywhere near close even at 250mg.


short lived, insanely dose hungry, expensive for the rather small output i'd pretty much put this into the worthless category.

I ordered mine on the same basis. If you take it for what it is then there's no reason you shouldn't have some fun with it, for a couple of hours at least.


Funny thing is, when I tipped my 500mg out of the bag to chop it up my girlfriend said "imagine if you snorted that all up in one big line!" As it turns out I could probably have done that and been fine, as long I didn't choke to death.

Before then I just associated it with people going insane for 12 hours, but obviously, I was a fool. Not that it makes any difference because I can't get any :/

In my experience 3-MeO-PCP feels pretty lucid and clean, not wacky at all. But then I'm not at all prone to mania on dissociatives. I'm with you on the PCP thing, I'd go to quite some lengths to get hold of some, but I doubt I'll ever have the opportunity.

I must say that even MXE felt kind of lame to me and not like a drug that someone takes for fun.

I ordered the NENK out of curiosity, but it seems its even more lame than MXE. 


If it isnt very dissociating what does it do then? 

Could you at least take it and go out and appear mostly sober while having an "I dont give a shit" feeling, MXE could accomplish that a little with low doses?

^ MXE is pretty much my favourite drug and I have a lot of fun on it, different strokes and all that...


What does NENK do apart from being mildly dissociating? Nothing, it's just a mild dissociative. You could use it for the purpose you describe, but you'd need to have a lot of it and be somewhere where is was convenient to redose every half hour or so.


EDIT: Sorry everyone, you all know my opinion by now, I'm not sure why I keep replying to every post in this thread. Actually I do know, it's because I should be writing my thesis and I'm procrastinating. So I'll shut up and go do that.

@thikal, I doubt dissociatives are going to be effective to cure an MDMA hangover. What you need to cure an empathogen hangover is lots of good sleep, lots of fresh water, lots of fresh fruits, and lots of fresh air.

3-MEO-PCP and most arylcyclohexylamines may end up being scheduled here in the UK.

I've also heard O-Desmethyltramadol is under the same scrutiny at the moment.

... i did a couple of weeks back

in a nut shell i repeated whats already been said [ if K = 10 then NEK = 7 ] less viual, for me it was a lot less comfortable and a lot less euphoric than K

i felt restless and needed to move; more like 45 minutes of MXE than a K alternative....i didnt really enjoy it....but am tempted to get another sample...god knows why


ps - its not *that* bad on the nose, IMO it didnt burn or bleed, just had an annoying ammount of snot up there the next day or two....which hasn never happened with any other powder

Does it have to be snorted or does it also work sublingually like MXE?

I prefer to not fuck my nose up when I dont have to.


I think my dissociatives tolerance is rather low again, I went through ~1g of MXE during the summer and I think for most of you that is not very much.

So when I test it I can write something here.


For me the short duration isnt necesarily a bad thing because lying around not wanting to do anything or not being able for 3-4 hours got boring for me. (MXE)

Ah, thanks bro. I do remember you posting that now. 


Looks like something I won't bother with. Even MXE I have only tried 3 times in over a year, and I still have the same baggie of powder from the gram that I bought last summer. I guess dissociatives are not really my bag any more.

Past experience. The ACMD have made a comprehensive recommendation, along with the required legal text to schedule these as soon as the home office is ready. The HO has released a statement that they have accepted this advice and in the past this has been the 2 week notice mark.

^Soon as MXE is made properly illegal under the MoDA, if the Home Office follows ACMD advice in full as they almost certainly will, then a whole range of arylcyclohexylamines will become class B, yes, absolutely correct, just to reinforce the point for Survived Abortion's benefit.


From: [http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/publications/agencies-public-bodies/acmd1/methoxetamine2012?view=Binary](http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/publications/agencies-public-bodies/acmd1/methoxetamine2012?view=Binary)

Annex 3 gives the wording of what amounts to a catch-all ( or an attempt at one? ) for drugs in this class. Annex 2 and 4 give examples of known substances that would become illegal under the Annex 3 wording. It's an analogue law for the arylcyclohexylamine class.  It includes NENK you'll notice despite its very recent appearance. They reference websites as sources of info that they are using to track new substances, research they've done is as recent as September. See page 5 para 2.6 for example.  This class of substances is done.

i tried 220mg last night. snorted over the period of 20mins this amount gave me a high comparable in intensity of ~150mg ketamine(i have high k tolerance) but the fx have a slightly diffrent feel, but much more similar to ketamine than any other dissociative. it reminded me of what i have imagined tiletamine to be - ketamine without the warmth. 

its less euphoric but this does not mean unpleasant, its very pleasant and i think that with high doses even a hole can be achived. 

it hurts a little bit more than ketamine but this doesn't mean it hurts alot, no blood and stuff like that for sure. someone compared it to microwaved ket - thats a good comparison(when speaking about nose pain). 

i gave my other 40mg to a friend with just a brief history of dissociative use, she said she felt it strongly but was obviosly not as im topressed as with ketamine.


for my self i know that im going to try a gram of stuff to see if its worth the money, but my feeling is that at this price its pointless. 15-20e for a gram looks like the maximum im willing to pay. its a wonderfull chem but you need alot of it

I've tried to reach the hole but even 500+ mg doses won't do the trick, but i have a sky high tolerance with regular k. 


It is indeed the closest RC for who want a ketamine trip but still not as good. A bit of a "empty dissociative". 


It seems that after you've reach the high feeling you cannot get higher.


Fellow with no ket experience may find it interesting, but k-head will be desapointed.

@Transform @Sepher, thank you, I was not aware of the recent changes. These bastards don't miss a trick, do they.


Not that this is gonna make it any more difficult to obtain the compounds if you want them, it just means UK vendors won't be selling any of them, and they haven't been selling methoxetamine since the emergency ban.

Would 50mg after the allergy test be a good starting point?

No ket experience and I took 60mg of MXE max so I have nothing to compare it to except the MXE.


You guys make it sound like its total shit and I have to sniff the whole bag to feel anything.

So Im not looking to get into a hole or anything just to definately notice some effects.

I second this. Earlier today I insufflated ~50mg and got mild effects, less looney then mxe but not as 'warm' as ketamine. I did enjoy it but for these prices I'll just do some more effort and try to get some regular ketamine instead.

cpulier : 50mg of NEK will be really really smoother than 50mg of mxe. It is really not the same shit imo.

My first dose was around 50mg and I did get some threshold effects, so I'd say it's worth starting that low. You never know, you could be especially sensitive to it - if so you'll be lucky. You probably will have to sniff the whole damn bag to really feel anything though, I know I did. The stuff just seems to have a low ceiling of effect - 120mg felt only a tiny bit stronger than 50mg to me. Twin that with a very short duration and you're looking a weak-ass drug.


It does *work* though - it is an active dissociative. If you don't expect too much from it you might well have some fun, for a little while at least.

How does this compare in the repeat-low-dose range to Ketamine? It seems people are having trouble holing with this but one of the other magical joys of Ketamine in my experience was taking repeated small bumps/lines over a night/day and just relaxing in the blissful childlike state of being it puts me in.


Does this compare in that department at all or is it lacking?


I'm wondering because I miss Ketamine and while I can still obtain it the price/quality ratio is not worth it to me at the moment. MXE was nice and is also available to me rather cheap - but I don't want the DRI/SRI effects, and want more of a plain dissociative like Ketamine to play with.


If holing is hard to achieve or even practically impossible that doesn't bother me so much since while I miss it, I miss the low doses more. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


Thanks in advance anyone who answers.

This is very much the way I used to like consuming K too and I'd say it definitely works in a similar, though not identical, way. 


I got a gram of NENK when it was first made available from a UK supplier (a good month or so ago I'd say) but hadn't tried it properly due to the nose pain. My nose takes so long to recover from even a few tiny lines of MXE or a bit of 'coke' these days that I'm trying to cut out snorting as much as possible.


So I followed the advice of a couple of people in this thread and instead made a solution with some de-ionised water in a nasal spray bottle. It was around 25mg per squirt and had absolutely no sting associated with use at all.


I used most of this, a gram minus a small line I'd tried previously to confirm the pain factor and a fair few squirts I gave to friends, on a night out which involved some heavy drinking. I found it to combine nicely in the same way that alcohol and K used to. Never too far out of it, but a noticeable wonk and good feeling every time I took a couple of squirts.


I doubt that I'll buy any more but I'd say it's well worth trying yourself.

I'm certainly not looking for identical, else I would just get myself some Ketamine shipped over ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png) but similar is of course good since Ketamine is one of my favourite drugs.


How much Ketamine would you personally use in each dose equivalent to your 25mg squirts if you were taking that instead? I've gathered this substance is less potent but I didn't find much difference between very low dose Ketamine and low dose Ketamine so the difference in strength might not be noticable with this at that level maybe.

I would like to point out that though people are getting diminished potency responses relative to Ketamine, that this may well be an artifact of the bioavailability of this drug at this ROA, and that when taken by injection, like Adder did, it might well indeed be more potent than ketamine.


Amino-methyl groups come off if you as much as sneeze at them, amino-ethyl groups are much harder to knock off.  An example of this is that DMT at 1000mg oral is inactive while DET at 50mg is active orally.


Ketamine is a deivative of PCM, NENK is a derivative of PCE, like MXE is.  For this reason it might well be that sublingually it might be more active than intranasally, which is good news for all you clogged and bleeding noses out there.

A friend did 50mg sublingual and though the effects and duration were radically different, particularly an absence of magic, he could somewhat equate it to 30mg MXE


People are snorting it "cause thats what you do with a ketamine" but it may be more akin to that other eticyclidine analog, MXE, in that sublingual is better than snorted.


Adder's  "a bit stronger than Ketamine" repoirt was from injected NENK, something else absent in this thread.


Sublingual might be more active than snorted, but injecting might make it a lot more potent still.


What would be a way to have low bioavailability from snorting?  Reduced absorption.  This thread is full with stuffed noses plugged shut with unresorbed NENK. Sublingual/plugging may be the way to go for those unwilling to inject.

Adder synthesized and injected and claimed from that ROA a somewhat increased potency and duration, as would be expected from SAR.  If an effective ROA can be found, it will likely show these characteristics.

Said it before, will say it again, there are several inconsistencies in Adders report that have resulted in many concluding it is  a work of fiction, just SAR speculation. Take it with a grain of salt, or barrel if you will.

Virgin Test:  50mg sublingual N-Ethyl-NorKetamine  (NENK)


One day after a friend's wonderful report I got my own parcel and decided to imbide as well, 50mg sublingual as he recommended.


Physical fitness was not good: I'm recovering from a bacterial lung infection and am on Amoxicillin. The time of day was just right though: the early morning, without having had breakfast, just after my morning coffee kicked in.


T+0:00h -- I sprinkled the 50mg saltlike glistennig powder under my tongue and mixed with saliva. It dissolved easier than MXE and aside from MXE's bitterness there was a minty/camphoraceous but FOUL taste to it, not unlike what one would expect of an organochlorine ketone. I don't use "disgusting" easily but this chemn tasted particularly bad, bitterness was moderate. Also prominent was a greater degree of anesthesia of the tongue and mouth lining than with MXE.  After 10 minutes I swallowed and chased with some water.


T+0.15h -- it could clearly be felt that effects were coming about, a bit earlier than MXE. Its more vasoconstrictive than MXE: cold fingers and toes!


T+0:20h -- The effect was relatively more stoning and peaceful, but also less euphoric and miraculous than MXE. There was a tendency to close the eyes, behind closed eyes a fformless three dimensional shifting mist was faintly seen.  In this mist, things appeared and dissolved.


T+0:30h -- Full bladder, had to take a pee, a stronger effect than with MXE Visuals were faint but very rich: fishes, stromatolites, onderwater life, far more animal life and less inorganic matter than usual for me on MXE. The gram potency was such that, though different in nature, 50mg sublingual NENK was approximately equivalent to 20-25mg sublingual MXE, it felt a little shy of half as potent.


T+0:45h  -- Phosphene salvos were shooting and boiling away in exquisite detail, but the short duration of action is the kiss of death of this compound.  While the visions wanted to psychologically intensify I could already feel the NENK getting pulled off the receptors.


T+1:00h -- The visually rewarding phase ended and I ate my breakfast. Second full bladder, NENK is really taking the piss!


T+1:30h -- mostly sober, but in mildly enhanced mood and a wee bit intoxicated still.


Will I take this substance again?  Yes, of the stash I have, in higher dose. Would I buy more?  At forty bucks a gram, absolutely not, it has to drop to about 15 to be in sane equilibrium with the common prices of MXE and Ketamine.


Overall a nice but mild experience.

the 50mg sublingual report sounds promising though. maybe nasal just isn't the way to go. rectal also i think was reported weak roa. so IM, IV, sublingual are  eventual possibilities...

My dissociative tolerance is relatively low, at this point I could hole off a total of 100mg MXE and when I was pristine this was about 80mg, so a tolerance of +25%  Please note that the visuals were FAINT but present. Interestingly I just been back to bed to catch some extra sleep  (the NENK made me feel like it) and once there there was more such imagery, so its well possible that NENK's potency is not too far removed from that of Norketamine. It still interfered with my hypnogogic phase.


About nasal, this topic is full of bloodied noses, and also plugged up ones, which might indicate that nasal bioavailability may be low. This could have many reasons, such as the NENK damaging or rendering less active the permeability. Given its vasoconstriction, that might well be through decreased blood supply to the mucous membrane of the nose.


Theories a plenty ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


My tolerance is miniscule, if I were to take 40mg MXE now it might well be a near overwhelming experience.


We must crack this nut guys, there must be some way short of injecting that will make this drug shine.

Why does everyone have such faith that this molecule will eventually "shine"? Sure, SAR suggests n-ethyl is moving in the right direction, but SAR is only so good, a prediction. There is a reason why Parke- Davis went with N-methyl, as well as 2- chloro as opposed to bromine, etc. Who knows why . . but they were nothing but thorough in their trials. Maybe this compound just sucks. All indications are just such.

Yeah it really does seem to me like NENK is just a bit rubbish. Maybe it's just a case of everyone who's bought it doesn't want to believe they've wasted their money?

@wayab:


I see MXE has a potency 1.5x that of Ketamine

You see 220mg NENK doing what 150mg Ketamine does

I guesstimated a potency for NENK of approximately 1/2 relative to MXE


The numbers add up, I think we might be seeing the same thing.


Approximately:  

50mg MXE = 75mg K = 100mg NENK

65mg MXE = 100mg K = 130mg NENK

100mg MXE = 150mg K = 200mg NENK

^asante: you ever tried to hole on NENK via sublingually ingesting like 200mg at once?


i tried about 150 intranasal but it did nothing more than the equivalent of 30-40mg MXE to me, besides blocking and bloodying my nose. i guess nasal is a shit ROA and someone mentioned NENK was pretty inactive plugged. so if you dont wanna IM, there is only sublingual left i guess.

I decided to not let it be a complete waste and take 30mg Methoxetamine sublingual. 10 minutes, 20 minutes, tis proceeded to ram me with synergistic dissociative effect. At 40min I was very much under the influnce and wolfed down a peanutbutter sandwich.


I sat on the toilet and closed my eyes. I saw the darkness lighting up and breaking up int three dimensional space. I was gonna Hole! A sacred moment! At that point the cartoon character Eric Cartman appeared, between me and the Hole, aiming a bullhorn at me shouting "HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO SUCK MY BALLS, MR GARRISON?!" I thought "oh shit, now you've done it!


This was hitting me so hard, I took 3mg Bromazepam (equivalent of 5mg valium) and headed for bed. In bed I heard (hearing only starts for me at 120+mg MXE normally) Cartman's voice  "OH MY GOD THEY HOLED ASANTE! YOU BASTARDS!"


I plunged into a unique Hole.  All the profundity was there, but also the mundane.  unlike most of my MXE holes this was high velocity, I zapped between the most unlikely viewpoints seeing and experiencing things I've never seen at great speed, all across the universe.


The Hole was intense and very rapid, it had its own flavor by combining the NENK with MXE.  It was a VERY favorable place to be in, I'm still gobsmacked at the variety of experience I encountered.


The Hole lasted from 1:45-3:30 in the experiment, a good solid 1 3/4 hour of WILD exciting yet profound Hole.


As disappointed I was, as excited I am now about the synergism between NENK and MXE. This was AWESOME!


Obsidius, if NENK blocks your nose that isnt just inconvenience, its also drug not entering your system, so yes it does seem nasal sucks for NENK.  And thats not to mention all those nosebleeds all over this thread. NENK just doesnt sit well in the nose, it doesnt get absorbed and it bleeds.

^asante, would a 95% EtOH solution with NENK be better for sublingual absorbtion? i was thinking 100mg-150mg in 2-4ml, depending on how well it dissolves and then holding the liquid under your tongue for 10 minutes. the sideeffects of the nose arent worth the hassle with NENK, but if sublingual works, i'd try this ROA.


The syngery with MXE sounds interesting, since MXE alone got boring for me. i usually mix it with an phen or tryptamine these days.


^^danharper01: i heared its pretty much inactive oral, like ketamine is.

I'd love to hear some reports of higher sublingual doses, or maybe IM. Seems like nasal admin isn't the way to go with this chem then, and I sort of had a niggling feeling this might be the case. 


I'd particularly like to hear about ~150mg-200mg sublingual for example, just to see if at this higher level it provides a more full experience or if with sublingual this compound is lacklustre too even at higher doses.


I might have to get my hands on this just for experiment's sake if it isn't already illegal before I do.

Ugh, yeah. I'm not much one for putting chemicals in my mouth in the first place, and that seems like a lot of powder. Good luck to those of you who are willing to experiment with this ROA though - it seems like it could be more worthwhile than snorting. I'll watch you and the IM/IV experimenters from the sidelines...

I've gathered this substance is less potent but I didn't find much difference between very low dose Ketamine and low dose Ketamine so the difference in strength might not be noticable with this at that level maybe.

Having done NENK sublingual in doses up to 80mg, 150-200mg sub would be doable. The problem would not be pain or bitterness but rather foulness, iut would be not unlike holding fabric softener under your tongue.


Also.. 200mg sub? ORLY? I've been thinking about my sublingual experimenting and I think at most 10mg passes the membrane, the rest is oral ingestion, so you might as well cut out the middle man and drop NENK directly on an empty stomach, with a shotglass of water or OJ.


Also, that much alkaloid salt would be highly osmotic, sucking on the membranes more than being absorbed through them.

Wrote this somewhere else:


I just put some 20-50mg under my tongue and it definately works, with this drug I think it doesnt matter how much or little you take its extremely mild.

But the sublingual ROA definately works even though Im only mildly dissociated.

Its less euphoric than MXE and less dissociating but it also feels cleaner at what it does, that means no confusion.

The stuff I have is sold as NENK and it must be one of the most decadent drugs of this planet, money wise, coke is on second place now.

It might have the anti-depressant effect that seemingly all the dissociatives share.


@ Asante I dont have the foul taste, just mostly bitter and it looks somewhat like sugar.

Round 3 - 120mg NENK sublingual.


The taste is bad but also the numbing is strong, so that helped.


As I was ascending, it was as if the whole world held its breath.  I came into a cocoon of quiet and peace.  Noises from the outside world were dampened and made more quiet, noises I made within my cocoon, shifting in my chair, smoking a cig, were loud by contrast. Depth, shape and color of the visual field were enhanced.  Everything looked soft, comfortable. I became ever more peaceful, breath slowing and shallowing, my thoughts mildening and slowing, letting the peace take me.


With closed eyes only very faint visuals in a green mist that had form.


There was some belching as I relaxed more and more.  Around 45min into it I began to get mild bowel cramps, the point where my stomach empties into my intestine.  This was an annoying disturbance of the peace.


It was almost as if I had taken a sedative, there was no bang, no wow, no inspiration and bending of thought like I'm used to and much enjoy in Methoxetamine, all there was was this beautiful quiet peace.


I can no longer make a gram potency estimate compared to MXE, the drugs are too dissimilar.  The effects are very mild but the dose was relatively strong.  It was massively uneventful, if that makes sense.  I have no doubt that now, 1:30 later if I were to take just 30mg MXE I'd be devoured by a Hole. It was strong in its mildness.


Is it worth it?  I have to conclude, no. Not worth paying the money for, not worth eating so many milligrams of a substance which probably shares a problematic metabolite with ketamine.


Sublingually, by itself, the drug is a disappointment, it needs other ROA and combinations to shine, if shine it will. I see no point in taking the dose higher.

You only need 30mg sublingual MXE to hole?

The fact that you probably swallow it makes it overall a little stronger than 30mg insufflated but still

No you misunderstand:  I normally need 90-120mg MXE to Hole, but I expected to be able to on 30mg because I had used the NENK.  I didnt put it to the test though, I stayed sober.


NENK and MXE synergize, see my earlier posts in this topic.

Sniffing this is a waste. 120mg lasts about 15 minutes. I once took 300mg orally and effects were the same but still only lasted about 45 minutes.


And it really blocks my nose afterwards. Doesn't hurt but just annoying.

To be honest it isn't that great. Even orally only lasts about 45 minutes. There is a feeling of nice calmness, that's about it.

Lol, what I meant was about 450mg sniffed over about seven hours. Then a 300mg bomb which I took another time. About 10 minutes ago I blew my nose and got a nose bleed. This is the second time NEK has given me a nose bleed, I've NEVER had one from any other drug.


But thanks for your concern Asante. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

It's like shorter acting and less centrally active than Ketamine. It's a hard feeling to describe. Like the door will never be fully opened if that makes sense.

Pontifex, I think that the trouble the noninjectors are having are due to decreasing bioavailability as the dose increases.  I think if you inject it should be possible to hole on it, and the dose might not even be that different from Ketamine in IM.


Please be very careful though, if this drug has downsides, injection is where they are going to surface.

i recently tried 80mg sublingual dissolved in 95% ethyl. i wasnt quite impressed by it although i certainly felt some effects. later i bumped a bit mxe and tried again with the same dose. this time it was far more wobbly, so i guess it needs either a way higher dose, a specific route or a solid basis to get flowing.

If you use it as a booster, I see that only working well if you boost another Dissociative.

Plenty. Not that i need to justify my existence to you or anyone else.

The point I was making is - if i ingest a chemical its because i want to, not to score bluelight points on a thread full of internet strangers, a thread that will disappear into obscurity once this chemical is banned anyway.


But hey, its his body, i was just stating my opinon. He's gunna feel like a right tit if his arm drops off tho ay ?

The chemical is banned in several places but still widely consumed in those places. I doubt it'll just disappear.


EDIT Actually that's bollocks, this will most likely disappear, I was thinking we were talking about MXE.

I've looked through the thread mostly but I don't think theres been much info mentioned on an N-Ethyl-Norketamine and MDMA combination?


Has anyone had any experience with this - Anyone with good chemical knowledge can give an educated assumption on whether this would work? Kitty flipping is a well documented combination so my thoughts are if this N-ENK is very similar to ketamine this combination could be good. 


Also, I have just had 110mg insufflated - T+20mins: Feel very good, I have had experience with MXE and DXM but not with Ketamine yet. I have zero tolerance to dissociatives currently, I last did MXE over a year ago. I took a 20mg allergy test 45mins ago. Things I have noticed: Numbness of teeth, lips and general analgesic effects. My thoughts arent very muddled or slow like a moderate to high dose of DXM would be or similar with MXE, it just feels very euphoric and stimulating. I smoked a bowl 15mins after, which definitely enhanced the effects quickly. People have also been talking about how painful this is on the nose. I don't have alot of experience insufflating substances, worse has been MDMA. This does not feel that bad to be honest, I made sure to crush it up very thoroughly, making it into a very fine powder. There was a very strong sting instantly for the first 5-10s, but as soon as it came it went away. The drip is not as strong as MXE in my opinion. It also feels quite stimulating - heart rate has increased and sweating slightly despite how cold it is. 


Overall I very much like this compound.

I'm wondering the same thing! I found N-ethyl-Norketamine a little bit "speedier" than ketamine when you stop the session, ala MXE comedown but way less jittery. Maybe a serotoninergic like MDMA and N-ethyl-norketamine may carry more risks than Ketamine+MDMA? What about 6-APB and NENK? Methylone and NENK? 


I find the antidepressant effect of NENK quasi inexistant. I didn't find Ketamine antidepressent effet yet too, but I tried ketamine just twice so i'm not expermimented at all in this field.

Are you depressed normally? You said the comedown is more like MXE, did you get irrational feelings of depression and unhappiness from it? (Just asking because I get that from MXE after some heavy abuse)


I cant wait to try this one but I am yet to find a vendor stocking it.

No i'm not depressed hehe. But with Salvia for exemple, you really feel an antidepressent effect. No with MXE i feel a surge in energy at the end of the experiment, insomnia and a crave to cool down with gabaergics or opiates (but less than a stimulant). I don't heavy abuse MXE, an found that plugging reduce the duration of the residual stimulation. (but that's not the subject^^)


Ketamine was totally pure of this shitty residual stimulation for me 0/10, NENK 2/10, MXE 10/10 to give you a picture. (sorry for my approximative language, I hope you can understand me^^)


I hope NENK will add peace and calm at the end of a 6-APB or methylone trip. If someone tried this combo, please share it with me ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

Sure, it wasn't really much of an allergy test to be honest. I was drunk when I tried it so I really should have thought about it more, I definitely should not have done that much either. In the end I thought it was terrible. For that hour and a half from first dose to redose were great, huge rush, sudden urge to do things. As I came down from the head rush high I felt terrible. The dissociative effect lasted for hours, I'm not sure how come, I smoked alot during and after - I was drunk to begin with - I have also been having a small dose of piracetam for the last week, maybe some of these affected it. After 3 hours I really wanted to sleep as it was 5am and I thought it was only going to last an hour. I was in some sort of weird dissociated but stimulated uncomfortable mental space, my heart rate was high and I couldn't relax it for hours - it was 6/7hours after the initial dose that my heart rate died down enough for me to sleep, somewhat. I kept waking up, thinking I was in some completely foreign room, there were loads of fractal patterns floating around the ceiling and general morphing of everything. Normally I would have found this fun but I just felt so physically awful, as if I was coming down from a big night of MDMA, but even that isnt as bad, it was bizarre, I really felt terrible. The next day nothing could interest me, no appetite, no happiness. Maybe this is something to do with dopamine release, somewhere I read it acts on the dopamine receptors, this could be what causes the initial rush and stimulation. But the crash was bad. I said my nose felt fine when I did it and it did, but thats because everything was numbed, I couldn't feel my lips again until at least 5 hours later. But the next day and all the following days my nose was destroyed. I thought I had made it into a fine powder but it still blocked my nose for 4 days and I've been blowing horrible shit out since, including blood mixed with the crap, no full on nose bleed though. I certainly will not be wanting to try this again.

I received a sample of this with stuff just after methoxetamine was put on the temporary scheduled in the list UK back in march. I tried it and wasn't too keen on the amount I needed to take for the effects it produced. After reading what other peoples are saying that is mixes well with mxe I might give it another try, mxe is my favourite of all the dissociatives so fingers crossed ![:-)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


Dear me 20% for an allergy test Jesus Christ that's beyond reckless. I always do 1%  of a threshold dose then once that doesn't show any negative signs I then take 5%. Taking un researched chemicals is dangerous enough so I do whatever i can to cut any risk. 

keep safe everyone :D

I soaked some NEK in acetone, estimated 300mg in 3mls and heated, then discarded the acetone and tried the NENK.


A small bump, ~15mg confirmed that it still stang unpleasantly, but I was surprised that I could feel it distinctly, akin to 5-10mg of MXE. I then insufflated some water and a further 26mg, which gave a pleasant dissociation akin to ~15-20mg of MXE and still gave nasal discomfort. It lasted for about 50 minutes from the last dose, with a dissociative fuzz lasting to ~t+2. It is difficult to compare to any other dissociative at this low dose. My nose was blocked slightly for the rest of the evening.


I woke up with a considerable amount of caked blood in the nostril which I took the first bump into. I did not wet this before insufflation.


In conclusion: 

Acetone washing appears to increase purity, but I cannot and will not compare to unwashed product as due to the nasal damage. 

Moistening nostrils before snorting may reduce membrane damage. It is too simple to *not *do this.

Well I have determined that it is not the material itself that is corrosive but the initial configuration it arrives in. How I hear you think? With a mortar and pestle, alas, now I've gone TOO FAR the other way, and I have a pile of drug dust so fine it goes straight down my god damn throat when I sniffy sniffy it. What can I do fellow ketanauts?

recrystallization?


Any way; Just re-read the entire thread; slightly frustrated at the lack of useful details and the sheer number of "I'm going to try 100mg intranasally tomorrow..." type posts. In my legendary hypocrisy I'll add my input. Tried this substance before (at first release) was unimpressed as I recall. My 250mg sample was split & the feeling I remeber most on finishing the small quantity was that it would take at least 300-400mg IM to receive anything worthwhile. I've just ordered 500mg and plan to IM 400mg tomorrow on arrival. Depending on Royal Fail's service that is...


Watch this space!


*nb: 400mg IM might seem like a large dosage for some; but it stress I still retain a huge tolerance from extensive MXE abuse.

Considering the uncertainty about whether this stuff is cut or not, I would advise against IMing it. I know everyone is probably itching for an IM report, but in this case I would rather determine the purity of the compound first to make sure the physiological reactions reported are merely a result of the compound itself and not a cut which has been added.


Whatever you do, please filter it with micron filters first and follow sterility procedures.

Having taken all the usual precautions (choosing not to list them assuming 'common' sense) I IM'd 200mg and at T+15m IM'd another 300mg. Overall impressions underwhelmed; Completely unable to hole from this material... It does bring a lot of the familiar feelings of Ketamine although it certainly lacks the immersion. Sadly nothing amazing to report; to sum up - I won't miss this if impending legislation comes about. It might be pleasant for someone new to dissociatives but the lack of a meaningful hole experience or total immersion at heroic dosages makes the chem a slight let down for me.

what dosage should I use on N-ethyl-Norketamine if I am going to swallow it? no snorting/IV'ing suggestions. just bombing.

will the dose have to be really high so thats why You guys are snorting it or ... ?


edit: anybody? its sitting right here in front of me and im quite eager to give it a try!


now if i got to bomb 500mg or sniff 250mb for same effects then ill fucking do the sniffing thing..some idiots sniff tobacco-type of stuff as well, swedes, we call them.

Hello, Dear BL'ers, Merry Christmas to You and Yours!


Can someone please answer, im still waiting to try it but its all behind the problem of me not knowing how to avoid the snorting part by finding out how much i need to swallow/bomb!!! (without using like 2-3grams to bomb and then feel it like You would from a dose 4 times smaller if sniffed or 8 times smaller if IV'd.


Also, would it help any if I drank my usual dose of 120mg methadone before N-E-NorK?


i also have plenty of benzos..


thank You!

i have a high dissociative tolerance and needed 220mgs snorted to feel like 100-120 ketamine(wich would be a low dose for me). i haven't tried oral but my feeling is that you would need 2x the amount or more for the same results but just in case that it hits harder oral start very low and build it up gradualy. there isn't much info on the diffrent roa's of this chem so be careful. also dissociatives potentate opiates so keep that in mind too...

@tyler - In my opinion it's just not a worthwile drug no matter how much you infufflate, and oral dosing is supposed to be just asineffective. From this thread it seems like sublingual is the only way to go, so maybe try that. 


Thanks for the reams of anecdote and opinion on opiates, benzos and barbituates that makes up the bulk of your post. I'll print it out and use it as a guide the next time I get hold of any downers.

i plugged a total of about 500mg of this spaced over two doses last night. Bear in mind I don't have much of a dissociative tolerance at all. Well fuck me it was very nice, I think I've found by far the best moa for this drug. It's a shame that on a whole it's so darn cost ineffective. Lets be straight here, I'd say at maximum potential it is about 6/10ths of what ketamine is. I was lying in bed skirting a k-hole for a good half hour, travelling on tantalizing trains of thought as per special K. I was fully immersed, forgot I had a body and all that, but I just couldn't enter a hole. I sort of put my toes over the egde though; while contemplating the interconnected paths of all the configurations and all the energy that flows through these configurations in the universe, especially in the temporal dimension, I felt my being stretch backwards through time, existing simultaneously as all the movements that led up to my current being. That was pretty cool. At about double the price of street K though, honestly, not really worth it.

Would you comment "hey here are a bunchnof reports i just made up based on SAR speculation and basic arylcyclohexylamine knowledge?" I doubt it. There are many inconsistencies in his reports that caused skepticism in those also working with these substances, and now that a few of these analogs have hit the market big time and are in complete contrast to his reports there is no doubt his write up is fiction. BTCP, bromadol? Gimme a break. Notice how he covered all the well known modifications, and theN after methoxetamine was release edited his post to include n something very similar? Several more of his "reports" don't match up to actual trials with these substances. Sorry, but I, and many others, call bullshit.


Trust beagle, hugo24, and a few others from the old days, not some young kid also claiming to work with fentanyl analogs as a teenager. Seriously? Book knowledge and speculation is one thing. Claiming these as actual human trials is downright wrong.

Ok so I have never been big on dissociative's   Like in my opinion PCP is devil water and smells like total death.  I def. didnt like MXE  that shit was way too crazy and it fucked hard with my head.  Ive robotripped twice and the second time it was with extra strength DXM  And I loved it.  Ive done k a few times  only really liked while already on other drugs mostly psychadelics  And Good Coke and Real K is The most Amazing high ever.  But I tell you this with about two beers in me 250 mgs (bag listed weight) (looked short to me but have no mg scale)  I did half sublingal  and the other half up my nose  took a bong rip   And Blast off     I was high as kite saw double -crazy body high- hard to walk on and function - Laughed alot-  Hard to talk full sentences-  But overall Pretty Awesome.  Experience lasted roughly an hour with an hour residual high.  I am interested in 2-meo-K   It sucks that I cant get real k around my area but thats the breaks.  I would probably purchase more of this next festival season to spice up and my nights a little more interesting.        Anyone have a similar experience to mine with this chem.  I have heard many mixed messages on this chem from folks.  Im thinking the real dissociative heads think its shit cause its a rc and different effects from the real deal. Or the other thought is that a lot of people bought NEK from a shitty source that could be in all reality a great shop just with a shitty version of NEK.  Or I react way differently from drugs then most folks.  Or because I have never been a fan of the dissociative side of drugs perfering Relaxing or Stimulating/euphoric     type drugs            Any Thoughts on any of this ?????  Oh yeah and Merry belated Christmas.

norketamine is mostly inactive centrally, but has unwanted side effects on the body. it is a metabolism product of ketamine in the human body, and likely also of N-ethyl-norketamine. despite the misleading name, N-ethyl-norketamine is actually closer related to ketamine than to norketamine. that's why norketamine is a really misleading shortcut when talking about N-ethyl-norketamine. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

As I looked at the NMR spectrum - didn't anyone think there could be no chlorine on C2 in the aromatic ring?

I don't think so? The [integral](http://i.imgur.com/qKYQZ.png)indicates that there are only four aromatic protons, as there should be.

I think the problem with insufflating ruins the chemical. I agree with people who say its moreish but what makes me have second thoughts on the next dose  is that I don't want to eff up my nasal cavity even more, IF I could even fit more of this crap up there.. Its still clogged from the last dose!!

well ive changed my mind about this stuff...

i feel into a 250mg bag last night and had a whale of a time, my nose feels clear today but i did spend some time crushing it into a fine powder.

i was putting some under my tounge some up my nose, i feel mixing the 2 ROAs helped...i have no tolerance and slowly dabbed and snorted small ammounts at first.

i was happily playing games and only really noticed the wonk on toilet or drink breaks.....then i turned out the lights, put on some music and lit a candle and ended the night with a large line / pile under the tounge.

was totally surpised when i felt myself smeared against the wall...

after some bad times on MXE and salvia it was nice to be in that state with no fear...if i'd had headphones instead of crappy laptop speakers and if i'd had rizlas to build a joint it would have been perfect.

A night putting small amounts under my tongue made the the buzz from the last line last longer that before [ last time it was 45 mins to get back to baseline ]

Not as deep or intense as K but yeah.....think i'll grab some more before the uk ban

So I have a truly reliable vendor who Does their own independent NMR testing on entire catalogue and I was wondering can this diss be used as an anaesthetic with IV admin? if so, would somebody tell me a safe dose for a 80 kg man with no tolerance for ketamine or any other nvda at the moment. I don't want to get stuck in fractal land on accident, if I just want oblivion, then there's a reason for it and fractal land might cause trauma to my little psyche.  any ideas/experiences, chemists who would tell me with authority?

Got a question, - one vendor is selling this  : C14H18ClNO or N-ethyl-ketamine, is it the same stuff this thread is about  NORKETAMINE? so many names for one chemical.


if yes, does it work like ketamine but is orally active due to higher bio-availability ? I've never tried ketamine, however, did MXE plenty of times in doses up to 120mgs (never more than 85mgs at once though ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) and Im able to get a hold of this Ethketamine (yet another name for the same stuff ???? please clarify ! ) , how does it comapre to regular ketamine in terms of dose /effects / duration . I really enjoy mxe experiences, but often do not have enoough free time to trip. 


also how active is it really orally ?

un

i'd be more than happy with ths ROA - needles are out of the question,  sniff - not a big fan of that either - only if it is a must .

Norketamine is not N-ethyl-norketamine. N-ethyl-ketamine is a more catchy but technically incorrect term which has been used to refer to N-ethyl-norketamine. It may be worth investigating a new vendor if your current one has the wrong name.

Save your money. N-Ethyl-norketamine is shite by all ROAs. Nasal or IM are essential to get anything from it and it's quite corrosive so those are horrible. When it does work it's impotent.

^I just IMed 100mg today for the first time.  Not at all as strong as I was expecting.  I have no experience with Ketamine but compared to MXE it was probably comparable to 20mg IM.  I only have 250mg left and am planning to IM the rest of it in the coming week or so.


50 minutes later: Well I finished off the rest of my NENK and I have to say I am remarkably unimpressed with this substance.  250mg IM really did not feel much stronger than the 100mg IM.

^ It takes the best bits of MXE and the best bits of ketamine


then throws them out the window and gives a mild, neutral experience likely to wear off in the time it takes to roll a joint. 

Tolerance builds silly fast too...by the time i got to the bottom of a bag it wasnt doing much at all

This was also my experience.  I have only done it once so far, but these were my thoughts.  It produces the same exact same swooning feeling in my head that ketamine does, but without the psychedelia.  It did not have any other weird side effects or anything worrisome, but was just totally uninteresting compared to K.  If it wan't for the fact that it left my nose stuffed up for a full day afterwards, I probably would have had some more fun mixing it with other things by now, but that first experience has left me uninspired to bust it out again.

Oh yeah, it definitely does not last longer than K.

N-ethylnorketamine is nothing compared to ketamine. Mind, this is my view after going through 4 grams of NENK and but 1 gram of Ketamine. 


But I've come to reconsider my position on it a bit. Some thoughts: it is neigh impossible to hole on, getting good effects takes a huge chunk out of your wallet, and because dosage is higher, you could expect more of the dreaded K bladder problems. But if the alternatives consists of either the all-too-speedy-and-at-times-dysphoric 3-meo-pcp, or the very enjoyable 4-meo-pcp (which although great lasts a very long time and with lasting brain fog the day after), the loved, holy and flexible but highly addictive MXE (which presents some uinque problems of its own), or the highly ineffectual 2-meo-ketamine, I actually feel I prefer NENK to those - especially if added as a bit of "sprinkle" on top of some s-isomer Ketamine (which is hard to come by here, so there's good reason to try to make it last longer by combining it with NENK). 


If taken the nasal route, be very careful to chop up even the tiniest of the crystals. Having that said, I've never experienced the kind of nosebleeds described by other users earlier in this thread, just a general clogging up that might persist for 1-2 days - but surely nothing like anything corrosive. Rectal administration seems a tad bit less effective, but as ineffective as for example the ratio between nasal and rectal for regular Ketamine. The NENK clogging has led me to the strategy of combingin, for example, 100 mg NENK divided into three lines + 100 mg rectally administered. 


In all probability, NENK is best saved for something to spice up a 5ht2a hallucinogen or empathogen rather than trying to chase a hole or feeling you won't ever get to.


Like with 4-meo-pcp, there is also still the problem with price per session, but on the other hand, 4-meo-pcp seems to be much rarer these days (sadly)


Ketamine > 4-meo-pcp > MXE > NENK > 3-meo-pcp > 2-meo-ketamine, if I had to generalize.

I really like the way you said that. It's like psychedelics are nutritious for your brain on the level of fucking Cheerios or some shit. Eat your Vitamins and Ketamine kids(jk), it'll help you learn how to play games with your ABC's. It's crazy how Language Oriented I find dissociatives to be. They jump into that part of your brain where word play lives.

Yep. This is only good as a filler substance to boost psychedelics or other NMDA antagonists. Or if you are in pain/withdrawal. It would have been better if snorting it wasn't so horrendous, that's really what ruins it for me. That, and the mediocre effects you get unless you want to take a monster dose.

Right, I received 1g today but have only just tested it.


I've gone through the first few pages of this thread and the last few, and the difference in comments struck me clueless ![:?](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/confused.gif)

But while reading I noticed something...


NENK's full title is ofcourse *2-(2-Chlorophenyl)-2-(ethylamino)cyclohexan-1-one*, and the supplier I got it from noted three things:

1. That the purity may vary between batches...

2. Of the confusion of names - N-Ethyl-Ketamine & N-Ethyl-Norketamine. And... 3...


> N-Ethyl-Ketamine will also be possible to exist, **but would be a tertiary amine and therefore is probably inactive since basically all the known Arylcyclohexylamines are sec-amines.**
> 
> So all N-Ethyl-Ketamine on the market is actually N-Ethyl-Norketamine and we just want to point this out here to avoid any confusion.
> 		
> Click to expand...
So this may be the reason to all the differences of opinion, but also I noticed another thing while I look at my bag:

My sample is a Racemic sample! ... *(RS)2-(2-Chlorophenyl)-2-(ethylamino)cyclohexan-1-one*


I went above and beyond to create a line a little earlier (it really is crystally) and have snorted it in bits n pieces. It was larger than I thought it would be to create the effects but not by loads.

Aaaaand it's nice ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  Might do a trip report at some point (first one in years n years) as I've had Ketamine (pure racemic liquid evaporated), Methoxetamine (worked a fucking treat - Especially on one occasion after swallowing a huge dose by accident... that was **mental** ![8o](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eek.gif) ) and 2-MeO-Ketamine (not as powerful as either by far but it was calming and waaaay less disorienting than both MXE & K's dissociative powers) in the past, so I should be able to give a good one ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

So here's what I got out of this thread: 


This compound seems to disappoint members who have tried ketamine, but ket-naive users seem to enjoy it. 


NENK on it's own appears impossible to "hole" on. It is widely described as mild overall in effects, but still clearly dissociative in its own right.


Comparisons to MXE seem to be that NENK is clearer and less intoxicating but still wobbly. Using NENK in combination with MXE seems to bring out the best of both compounds.


ROA: Insufflation results in painful congested sinuses and nosebleeds for the majority of those who tried that route (I'd say about 75% ). Sub-lingual -> rectal -> oral seems to be the most efficacious (in order); a combination of thereof seems to work even better.


Duration seems short no matter the ROA. Insufflation seems to last approximately an hour, and sublingual/ oral seems to last up to three (from "hey, I feel something" to "yup, I'm sober"). It's not entirely clear to me whether redosing does much of anything at all, and most members seem to agree that less may be more dosage wise (there are mentions of higher doses not feeling much stronger than lower ones) - there may very well be a ceiling effect with this compound.


It seems to me that those going into experimenting with this compound who bring a "beginner's mind" so to speak (as in, no expectations of the compound, just an objective, observant frame of mind) get much more out of the experience than those attempting to draw comparisons between it and their other beloved dissociatives. Members of the latter group always seem disappointed.

Racemic is normal, it's what you can expect to get with pretty much all drugs except things like dextro-amphetamine, LSZ and maybe a few others. Why wouldn't your sample be racemic? ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


There shouldn't be so much confusion about the name. Yes "N-ethylketamine" might be a relatively popular name for one that is technically incorrect or incomplete, but it's not like there are other ketamine analogues that have an *extra* ethyl (which would make for a quaternary amine) so it doesn't seem likely to confuse the compound with another, that situation would be relevant and significant.


I hope you have fun and maybe this compound doesn't deserve to be called utter crap but until a lower price compensates for the lower potency I don't really see the point. I would try it if I didn't have monster dissociative tolerance tho.

Speaking as one who has a monster dissociative tolerance and has tried many of them, I'll put in a good word for NENK/NEK whatever-the-fuck it is. The above quote is right on the money, IMO. 


It's simply way too pricey. 


I found in large amounts (and for me, large means large, so I'm not going to name doses as it would be irresponsible) this is a really pleasant substance. It's calming, smooth, removes physical pain (as you'd expect), and is just overall a nice experience without any hard edges. It feels like you couldn't have a bad experience, it's so soft and silky. 


BUT... it does NOT last long, requires heaps (orally), and COSTS WAY TOO MUCH. 


I'd be willing to bet that there would be a lot more love for it if it were about an eighth of the current common price.

Most boring drug since 5-meo-dalt. I don't have massive tolerance, either - I play with dissociatives maybe once a week on average (MXE & 3-meo-PCP mostly, never had the opportunity to try ket or PCP). Oral doses were effective and I'm sure what's left of my sample will get used up eventually, but this wouldn't be my first choice for anything except maybe to treat pain (which is how I got into dissociatives to begin with - to treat chronic tooth pain). Even then, the duration is so short it might not be worth trying to use for pain, though I did notice that certain body parts (tongue, teeth, fingers) seemed to stay a bit numb for a day or two after ingestion. Maybe people with a phantom limb or similar sorts of pain might get something out of it. Biggest dose attempted yet was 200mg and I fell asleep on it. :/ IMO this stuff is rather corrosive and you couldn't convince me to stick it up my nose for nothing. If a dissociative-naive friend asked, I'd definitely recommend this material to start with over others in its class because it's so gentle and mild. Otherwise I'd tell people to save their money; it's nice but not terribly special.

i found effects to be pleasant... but didn't get far with half a gram (which wasn't cheap)... I was on AL-LAD when i trialed "NENK" probably made the experience more pleasant... 


Agreed that if it cost 1/8th of the current price it would be very interesting...

  that sounds pretty neat and useful..   but would u suggest iv , im ornasal/oral ways ?? i feel that i always got the very best results doing ketamine iv but yeah i havent tried this yet . but on its way  ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

wtf is ach sar? 


by all logic, this should be every bit as good as k but slightly more potent, right? 


fuck, trying to predict good new dissos seems quite the task... and yet, weren't both ketamine AND methoxetamine mindfully designed?
