**N-Cyclopropylpemoline** (also known as **Cyclazodone** ) is a novel [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) substance of the [4-oxazolidinone](/w/index.php?title=4-oxazolidinone&action=edit&redlink=1) class. It is structurally related to [pemoline](/w/index.php?title=Pemoline&action=edit&redlink=1) and [4-methylaminorex](/w/index.php?title=4-methylaminorex&action=edit&redlink=1) . The mechanism of action involves promoting the release of [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) and [norepinephrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Norepinephrine) in the brain.

Cyclazodone was developed in the 1960s by the American Cyanamid Company. Its non-clinical use has only found recent attention as a [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) study aid. It should be noted that the lack of pharmacological data and extremely limited history of human usage pose considerable concern regarding its long-term use as a substitute for prescription stimulants.

[Subjective effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effects) include [stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation) , [focus enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Focus_enhancement) , [stamina enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stamina_enhancement) , [increased blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure) , and mild [euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Euphoria) . Some anecdotal reports suggest that cyclazodone and its parent compound [pemoline](/w/index.php?title=Pemoline&action=edit&redlink=1) may have nootropic properties similar to central nervous system stimulants such as [methylphenidate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylphenidate) and [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) .

Cyclazodone had no documented history of recreational human usage prior to its appearance on the online research chemical market in 2017. Considering similar compounds, it is speculated that it may possess hepatotoxic and other yet-to-be-discovered toxic properties.

It is strongly advised to use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) if using this substance.

## Chemistry

Cyclazodone is a phenyl 4-oxazolidinone that differs from the parent [pemoline](/w/index.php?title=Pemoline&action=edit&redlink=1) by an N-cyclopropyl group. Compounds like cyclazodone of the 4-oxazolidinone class can be considered as 4-oxy derivatives of the 2-amino-5-aryloxazoline class including [aminorex](/w/index.php?title=Aminorex&action=edit&redlink=1) , [fluminorex](/w/index.php?title=Fluminorex&action=edit&redlink=1) , and [4-methylaminorex](/w/index.php?title=4-methylaminorex&action=edit&redlink=1) , conformationally restricted analogues of [phenethylamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamines) and [amphetamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamines) .

Cyclazodone is structurally most closely related, not to pemoline, but rather to two N-substituted derivatives of pemoline — [fenozolone](/w/index.php?title=Fenozolone&action=edit&redlink=1) (N-ethyl pemoline) and [thozalinone](/w/index.php?title=Thozalinone&action=edit&redlink=1) (N,N-dimethyl pemoline).

## Pharmacology

Cyclazodone is an approximately 3x - 5x more potent N-cyclopropyl derivative of [pemoline](/w/index.php?title=Pemoline&action=edit&redlink=1) . Pemoline is considered to be [dopaminergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) , but its precise method of action has not been fully determined. Pemoline has minimal affinity for [noradrenaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Noradrenaline) receptors and thus has minimal sympathomimetic side effects compared with typical dopaminergic central nervous system stimulants such as methylphenidate and [dextro](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Isomer) -amphetamine.

According to patents filed by the inventors, cyclazodone exhibited central nervous system stimulating properties and anorexigenic properties more potent than that of pemoline and various other N-lower-alkyl-substituted pemoline derivatives. At the time cyclazodone also offered a much more favorable therapeutic index and margin of safety than pemoline and other N-lower-alkyl-substituted pemoline derivatives.

In animal models, cyclazodone exhibits central nervous system stimulant and antidepressant efficacy and potency at least equal to that of [dextro](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Isomer) -amphetamine. The duration of maximum activity spanned 180 minutes, and the total duration of excitation was in excess of 6 hours. Furthermore, according to the inventor's patents, cyclazodone also possessed anorexic efficacy and potency at least equal to that of [dextro](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Isomer) -amphetamine in animal models, yet the toxicity of cyclazodone was found to be low in comparison with the activity thereof.

### Pharmacodynamics

Cyclazodone is likely an [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) -like [agonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist) of the Trace Amine Associated Receptor 1 (TAAR1), which is a key regulator of common and trace brain monoamines such as [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) , [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) and [noradrenaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Noradrenaline) . The agonism of this set of receptors results in the release of increased concentrations of [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) , [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) and [noradrenaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Noradrenaline) in the [synaptic cleft](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Synaptic_cleft) . This leads to [cognitive](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_acceleration) and [physical stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation) within the user.

## Subjective effects

The stimulant effects of cyclazodone have been compared to those of [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) , but with the addition of a low to moderate affinity for [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) release comparable to that of [methamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) and [3-FMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/3-FMA) . Additionally, it is noticeably less euphoric than amphetamine and appears to have less sympathomimetic activation.

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)** - Cyclazodone is reported to be somewhat stimulating though soft in a fashion that is slightly weaker to that of [methamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) , but stronger than that of [modafinil](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Modafinil) , [caffeine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Caffeine) , and [methylphenidate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylphenidate) .

- The visual effects of cyclazodone are usually less consistent and only mildly noticeable at higher dosages. They may manifest as a brightening of colors and areas of light appearing brighter than that of their surrounding. 
#### Distortions
 
- **[Drifting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_drifting)** *( [breathing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_drifting#Breathing) and [morphing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_drifting#Morphing) )* - This effect is usually subtle and barely noticeable and only occurs at higher dosages or when combined with [cannabis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cannabis) .
- **[Brightness alteration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Brightness_alteration)** - Cyclazodone can make spaces seem brighter as a result of its pupil dilating effects.
 
#### Hallucinatory states
 
- **[Transformations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Transformations)** - This effect occurs very rarely, and typically only when the user has taken high doses, is coming down, or has been awake for unusually long periods. It is usually very mild when it does occur. ### Cognitive effects
 
- - **[Analysis enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Analysis_enhancement)**
- **[Anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety)** & **[Paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia)** - This effect is dose dependent and typically occurs with overly high doses or after redosing and staying awake for extended periods of time.
- **[Anxiety suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety_suppression)** - Common to moderately high doses, when used infrequently, will tend to result in a complete loss of all anxiety symptoms.
- **[Cognitive euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_euphoria)** - This effect is dose dependent; a low dose will tend to produce only that of a slight mood lift and moderate to high doses are typically reported to be on par with that of [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) though less than that of [methamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) , [3-FMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/3-FMA) , and [4-methylaminorex](/w/index.php?title=4-methylaminorex&action=edit&redlink=1) . It is the strongest when used infrequently at moderate doses, and binges often result in a loss of this effect.
- **[Empathy, affection, and sociability enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Empathy,_affection,_and_sociability_enhancement)** - Cyclazodone has been reported to produce moderately strong prosocial and entactogenic effects which, although much weaker than that of traditional entactogens such as [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) , surpass that of [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) . As with most amphetamine-like stimulants, this effect rapidly fades with prolonged use.

### Experience reports

There are currently 0 experience reports which describe the effects of this substance in our [experience index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Experience_index) .

## Toxicity and harm potential

The toxicity and long-term health effects of recreational cyclazodone use do not seem to have been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dosage is unknown. This is because cyclazodone has a very limited history of human usage.

Another compound related in structure, [4-methylaminorex](/w/index.php?title=4-methylaminorex&action=edit&redlink=1) , is associated with pulmonary hypertension ; though, it is reported to induce far stronger stimulation than that of cyclazodone.

The structurally related compound pemoline was removed from the market after it was found to cause liver damage in children.

In rodents and primates, sufficiently high doses of monoamine [releasing agents](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Releasing_agent) cause dopaminergic neurotoxicity, or damage to dopamine neurons, which is characterized by reduced transporter and receptor function. There is no evidence that [releasing agents](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Releasing_agent) are directly neurotoxic in humans. However, large doses of [releasing agents](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Releasing_agent) may cause indirect neurotoxicity as a result of increased oxidative stress from reactive oxygen species and autoxidation of dopamine. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this substance.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

Addiction is a serious risk with heavy recreational stimulant use but is unlikely to arise from typical long-term medical use at therapeutic doses. Notably, the structurally related compound pemoline fails to demonstrate a potential for self-administration in primates and is considered to have reduced risk of dependence relative to those more typical dopaminergic stimulants. Caution is nonetheless advised, as with other monoamine [releasing agents](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Releasing_agent) .

Tolerance to many of the effects of cyclazodone develops with prolonged and repeated use. This results in users having to administer increasingly large doses to achieve the same effects. After that, it takes about 3 - 7 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 1 - 2 weeks to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). Cyclazodone presents cross-tolerance with all [dopaminergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) , meaning that after the consumption of cyclazodone all [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) will have a reduced effect.

### Psychosis

Based on its pharmacological similarity to other stimulants, it is likely that misuse of this compound can result in state of psychosis marked by a variety of symptoms (e.g., [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/External_hallucinations) , or [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) ). A review on the treatment for [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) and [methamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) abuse-induced psychosis states that about 5–15% of users fail to recover completely. The same review asserts that based upon at least one trial, [antipsychotic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antipsychotic) medications effectively resolve the symptoms of acute amphetamine psychosis. Psychosis very rarely arises from therapeutic use. The combination of the prolonged use of high doses combined with sleep deprivation significantly increases the risk of stimulant psychosis. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **[25x-NBOMe](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25x-NBOMe) & [25x-NBOH](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25x-NBOH)** - 25x compounds are highly stimulating and physically straining. Combinations with Cyclazodone should be strictly avoided due to the risk of excessive [stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation) and heart strain. This can result in [increased blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure) , [vasoconstriction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction) , panic attacks, [thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops) , [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) , and heart failure in extreme cases.
- **[Alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol)** - Combining alcohol with [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) can be dangerous due to the risk of accidental over-intoxication. Stimulants mask alcohol's [depressant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressant) effects, which is what most people use to assess their degree of intoxication. Once the stimulant wears off, the [depressant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressant) effects will be left unopposed, which can result in blackouts and severe [respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression) . If mixing, the user should strictly limit themselves to only drinking a certain amount of alcohol per hour.
- **[DXM](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DXM)** - Combinations with DXM should be avoided due to its inhibiting effects on [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) and [norepinephrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Norepinephrine) reuptake. There is an increased risk of [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) and hypertensive crisis, or [serotonin syndrome](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome) with serotonin releasers ( [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) , [methylone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylone) , [mephedrone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mephedrone) , etc.). Monitor blood pressure carefully and avoid strenuous physical activity.
- **[MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA)** - Any neurotoxic effects of MDMA are likely to be increased when other [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) are present. There is also a risk of excessive blood pressure and heart strain (cardiotoxicity).
- **[MXE](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MXE)** - Some reports suggest combinations with MXE may dangerously increase blood pressure and increase the risk of [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) .
- **[Dissociatives](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociatives)** - Both classes carry a risk of [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) , [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) , and these risk may be multiplied when combined.
- **[Stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants)** - Cyclazodone may be dangerous to combine with other [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) like [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) as they can [increase one's heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate) and [blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure) to dangerous levels.
- **[Tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol)** - Tramadol is known to lower the seizure threshold and combinations with stimulants may further increase this risk.

## Legal status

Cyclazodone is currently a gray area compound within all parts of the world, meaning its regulation lies in a legal gray area and that it is not known to be specifically illegal ( *"scheduled"* ) within any country. However, people may still be charged for its possession under certain circumstances such as under analogue laws and with intent to sell or consume. It is a banned stimulant under the World Anti-Doping Agency prohibited list.

- **Germany** : Cyclazodone is not a controlled substance under the BtMG ( *Narcotics Act* ) or the NpSG ( *New Psychoactive Substances Act* ). According to §2 AMG ( *Medicines Act* ) it would fall under the definition of a medicine because it induces pharmacological effect. By a decision of the European Court of Justice, this definition was declared ineffective because it was not compatible with EU law. Cyclazodone can be considered legal.
- **Switzerland** : Cyclazodone is not controlled under Buchstabe A, B, C and D. It could be considered legal.
- **United States** : Cyclazodone being an analogue of [pemoline](/w/index.php?title=Pemoline&action=edit&redlink=1) , a Schedule IV controlled substance in the US, may fall under Federal Analogue Act, 21 U.S.C. § 813 when intended for human consumption.

*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclazodone*

Cyclazodone is a centrally acting stimulant drug developed by American Cyanamid Company in the 1960s. The drug is related to other drugs such as pemoline and thozalinone. It displayed a favorable therapeutic index and margin of safety in comparison to pemoline and other N-lower-alkyl-substituted pemoline derivatives. The patents concluded that cyclazodone possessed properties efficacious in reducing fatigue and as a potential anorectic. Structural congeners of pemoline have been described as "excitants with unique properties distinguishing them from the sympathomimetic amines" whilst displaying less stimulatory activity and toxicity compared to amphetamine.
It is included under the World Anti-Doping Agency prohibited list.

## Safety

Cyclazodone has not been evaluated by the United States Food and Drug Administration for use in humans as a nootropic, anorectic, or stimulant and thus safety information is lacking.  However, in studies relating to the therapeutic uses of cyclazodone, it was noted that it exhibited less cardiotoxic and hepatotoxic effects than D-amphetamine in studies on mice.

## Synthesis

α-Chlorophenylacetyl chloride (1) and 1-cyclopropylurea (2) react to give the amide (3). The heterocycle cyclazodone is formed on threatment of this with sodium ethoxide.
