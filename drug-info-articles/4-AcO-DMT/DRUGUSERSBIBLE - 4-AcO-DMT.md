## Subjective Experience

4-ACO-DMT was first synthesised by Albert Hofmann and Franz Troxler in the early
1960's, and was patented by Sandoz Ltd in 1963. It is widely considered to produce
an almost identical experience to that of psilocybin containing mushrooms. Indeed,
Erowid states that it is "probably metabolically converted into psilocin in the body".

At time of writing this report it is increasingly popular, including with researchers
seeking to replicate the famed "McKenna experience" via doses in excess of 50mg. A
word of caution here though: there are a number of reports of ++++ experiences
occurring with doses of under 20mg. It is important, therefore, to adhere to standard
safety measures even though this chemical is generally considered to be relatively
benign.

I do have a large dose experience of 4-ACO-DMT on my future bucket list, but today I
have to remain broadly functional, as there is potential for social interaction for
which I need to be relatively unimpaired. For this reason I will start extremely low,
just to get a feel for it.

Note that I am also rather tired this morning, and slightly hung-over. This is clearly
not the perfect condition for testing, which is another factor that gravitates towards a
small dose experiment.

```
T+0:00 I consume approximately 6mg orally: straight down the hatch with
water. [11:45am]
```
```
T+0:30 I have quickly developed a psychedelic headspace, and already it is a
fairly strong one. Colours are brighter and I notice that my focus drifts onto
different objects almost of its own accord. In my case, the commonly stated
onset period of two hours is clearly not correct.
```
```
T+0:45 I feel chilly, so I add an extra layer of clothing. Regarding vision, there
is some diffraction and maybe a little morphing in play, with slight tracers and
over-currents also appearing.
```
```
T+1:00 This would be very pleasant if I wasn't so tired. Checking in the
mirror, my pupils are dilated. The headspace is still very apparent.
```
```
T+1:30 At this point I succumb to the need for sleep. This is a waste in some
respects, but it is needed.
```
```
T+3:30 I am well awake now and find that I am close to baseline. I slept
deeply for about half an hour and dozed for the rest of the time, basking in the
headspace.
```
There is no doubt that this was the real deal. The feel was close to my experience of
magic mushrooms, as expected, and I am surprised that it was so active at such a low
dose.

Its short duration was another surprise, even though some of the time projections
quoted online suggested that this could occur. This aspect certainly places it into a
niche that is under-populated by other psychedelics of this nature.

It was a pleasant ride, despite my poor condition.

I look forward to further experimentation during the coming months, and perhaps a
deeper and more spiritually meaningful trip.
