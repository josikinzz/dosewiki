Nitrous Oxide
 
Basics
 
by Erowid
 
DESCRIPTION #
 
[Nitrous Oxide Images](https://erowid.org/nitrous_images.shtml)
 
Nitrous Oxide (N 2 O) is a simple gas that, when inhaled, causes rapid analgesia (pain relief), euphoria, mild sedation, and sometimes psychedelic dissociation. It has been used in dentistry since the mid 1800's and recreationally since the late 1700's when it earned the name 'laughing gas' because of its tendency to cause laughter in those who inhale. 
 
[ [Main Nitrous Vault](https://erowid.org/nitrous.shtml) ]
 
Dose #
 
Nitrous is most frequently used in the form of whipped cream chargers, small metal cartridges which are 'cracked' either into a whipped cream canister or with a special 'cracker' into a balloon for inhalation. A single cartridge is between one and three lungs full of gas. One or two lung fulls is generally enough for a short nitrous experience although many people choose to use many cartridges throughout the course of a night.
 
Price #
 
nitrous chargers are sold for between .50 and 1.50 USD per cartridge depending on store and size of purchase. Balloons of nitrous at parties are sold from 3-5$ per balloon. Tank-refills of medical grade nitrous oxide are diverted from non recreational medical, chemical, and industrial use. A single standard whippet cartridge contains 8 grams of nitrous oxide.
 
[Law](https://erowid.org/nitrous_law.shtml) #
 
Nitrous Oxide is unscheduled in the United States and available over the counter. In many states it is illegal to sell Nitrous to a minor and in some states it is specifically illegal to inhale Nitrous Oxide for intoxication purposes. Nitrous oxide is controlled differerently around the world. A few countries control it as a pharmaceutical, while many allow its possession for food uses without any licensing.
 
[Chemistry](https://erowid.org/nitrous_chemistry.shtml) #
 
Nitrous Oxide (N 2 O) is an extremely simple naturally occurring gas which is produced synthetically for sale.

[History](https://erowid.org/nitrous_timeline.php) #
 
Nitrous Oxide gas was first discovered by English scientist Joseph Priestley in 1772 and was first published about in 1776. In 1799 Humphry Davy gave Nitrous to visitors at the Pneumatic Institute and coined the term "laughing gas". Through his experiments he discovered Nitrous oxide's analgesic effects in 1800. From 1800 to 1840, Nitrous was primarily used for recreation at travelling public shows, but in 1844-1845 Nitrous was recognized as having some medical use in dentistry. In the late 1800's William James published some accounts of his work with Nitrous Oxide and called its effects of "some metaphysical significance". Nitrous has remained popular throughout the 20th Century and is sold over the counter in small cartridges ("whippets") for making whipped cream and in large tanks for industrial and medical purposes.
 
Terminology / Slang #
 
The Substance:
 
Nitrous Oxide; Nitrous; Laughing Gas; Hippy Crack; N 2 O.
 
The Experience:
 
No common terms known.
 
[EFFECTS](https://erowid.org/nitrous_effects.shtml) #
 
Effects Summary Needed.
 
Onset #
 
When inhaled, Nitrous generally reaches full effects within a few seconds.
 
Duration #
 
Effects from a single inhalation of Nitrous Oxide last a few minutes. Most recreational Nitrous use consists of multiple inhalations over a period of time.
 
Visual Effects #
 
Some closed eye visuals effects are common with strong nitrous effects, though most often consist of patterns. Less common are more coherent visuals and are notoriously hard to remember after the effects have diminished. Open eye visuals are most often described as distortions of space and a purple or grey-blue hue.
 
[PROBLEMS](https://erowid.org/nitrous_health.shtml) #
 
Although generaly considered quite safe when used medically and sparingly, it has some negative health consequences when used chronically. Heavy Nitrous use can lead to a depletion of vitamin B 12 . This can cause numbing of fine nerve endings, especially noticeable in the fingers and toes. Supplements of B 12 may reduce the chances of this occurring in heavy users. Shots of B 12 are given as a treatment for advanced depletion. If left untreated B 12 deficiency can lead to long-term damage. 
 
 Most of the acute dangers associated with Nitrous Oxide are related to accidents during ingestion. In medical applications, Nitrous is dispensed in combination with Oxygen. Inhaling Nitrous alone is not required to get full effects, the effects are the result of the nitrous in the system, not of oxygen deprivation. It is important for users to take breaths of air between hits. 
 
 A handful of people also suffocate each year while using nitrous in the US when the balloon, garbage bag, or mask used to inhale the nitrous stays on the person's face as they fade from consciousness. Some tank-users also suffocate when the valve is left open in a confined space such as a car or small room.
 
Contraindications #
 
Contraindications Summary Needed.
 
Addiction Potential #
 
Nitrous has gained the nickname 'hippy-crack' because it lends itself to repeated and compulsive use for some people. While uncommon, it is not unheard of to find individuals who use Nitrous many times a day, every day, generally among those with easy access to large quantities.

**Nitrous Oxide Health** 
 **By Erowid** 
Nitrous oxide has been safely used as a mild anaesthetic for over 150 years. Problems with its use come primarily from carelessness. Potential problems include : 
- Brain injury and suffocation can result from lack of oxygen. When used as an anaesthetic, nitrous is always administered in combination with oxygen. Never use nitrous in any manner that does not provide for adequate oxygen intake. 
 
 Note that it is not necessary to feel shortness of breath or a sense of oxygen deprivation in order for the body to be dangerously short of oxygen. The sensation of being unable to breathe comes as a result of unusually high levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) rather than low levels of oxygen. Because of this, people who inhale pure nitrous oxide or other gases do not have the sensation of being unable to breathe, despite not getting enough (or any) oxygen. It is quite possible to suffocate while breathing pure nitrous oxide without ever feeling discomfort or a shortness of breath. 
 
 
- Never strap a gas mask to your face while using pure nitrous as it is possible to black out and die from lack of oxygen. Never use a garbage bag as a delivery device. It is possible (and has happened) to black out and suffocate when the bag falls over the nose and mouth. Never open a tank of nitrous in a sealed room, closet, car, or other space.
 
 Very cold temperatures of the gas can freeze the lips and throat if taken directly from a tank or whippit. Releasing the gas into a balloon first allows the gas to warm before being administered. 
 
 High levels of pressure may rupture blood vessels in the lungs and force air into the chest cavity, causing the lungs to collapse. This is primarily a problem when nitrous is being administered directly from a tank or other pressurized container. Again, releasing the gas into a balloon first eliminates this risk. 
 
 Heavy and frequent nitrous use can deplete vitamin B 12 in the body and lead to serious and unpleasant neurological problems. Users may experience numbness and tingling in the fingers, toes, lips, etc. In more severe cases, numbness of all extremeties. Taking B 12 supplements, especially in combination with multi vitamin and complete amino acid supplements, may help alleviate this problem. If you experience these symptoms, cease nitrous use immediately and if the symptoms persist, seek medical attention. See [Nitrous & B-Vitamin Dangers](https://erowid.org/nitrous_health2.shtml) . 
 
 Careless use of nitrous oxide can also cause nausea, vomiting, and disorientation, primarily from inhaling too much, too soon. 
 
 Since nitrous produces a temporary loss of motor control and dissociation, it's extremely unwise to inhale it while standing or while in any situation where unconsciousness is dangerous. 
 
 Some users of nitrous report headaches and generalized discomfort for an hour or more after inhalation. 
 
 Nitric Oxide, a toxic industrial gas, is occasionally mistaken for Nitrous Oxide. Users should be careful they know what they are inhaling. Inhaling Nitric Oxide can permanently damage the lungs or kill. 
 
 Olney's Lesions: there is little to no evidence that Nitrous Oxide use causes the brain lesions described in William White's "This is your Brain on Dissociatives" and, without further evidence, this hypothesis should be considered invalid for Nitrous Oxide.

Nitrous
 
Legal Status
 
by Erowid
 
U.S. FEDERAL LAW #
 
Caution : All legal information should be verified through other sources. [ see below ]
 
**U.S. FEDERAL LEGAL SUMMARY**
**Nitrous**
- REGULATED: No
- STATUS: FDA Regulated
- SCHEDULE: Un-Scheduled
 
Nitrous is available over-the-counter in kitchen stores and head shops. At this point its sale for human consumption is federally regulated under FDA rules. Possession is not illegal, but sale or distribution for human consumption can be prosecuted under the Food Drug and Cosmetics Act. However, in many states is it illegal to sell or distribute nitrous oxide to a minor and in many states it is illegal to consume nitrous oxide for recreational purposes. It is also illegal in many states to inhale nitrous oxide for intoxication purposes. 
 
 There are cases where sale of nitrous oxide has been prosecuted under the 'misbranding' clause of the FDCA.
 
U.S. STATE LAW #
 
Many states outlaw the use of nitrous for recreational purposes and the sale of nitrous oxide in tanks is controlled with a variety of licensing requirements. 
 
 [State Laws Concerning Nitrous Oxide (May 2002)](http://www.cognitiveliberty.org/dll/N20_state_laws.htm) 
 [State by State Inhalant Legislation (somewhat out of date, 1997)](https://erowid.org/chemicals/inhalants/inhalants_law1.shtml) 
 
 
California #
 
California state law prohibits the possession of nitrous oxide with the intent to use it as a psychoactive unless it is administered by medical personnel. See California penal code 381b : "381b. Any person who possesses nitrous oxide or any substance containing nitrous oxide, with the intent to breathe, inhale, or ingest for the purpose of causing a condition of intoxication,elation, euphoria, dizziness, stupefaction, or dulling of the senses or for the purpose of, in any manner, changing, distorting, or disturbing the audio, visual, or mental processes, or who knowingly and with the intent to do so is under the influence of nitrous oxide or any material containing nitrous oxide is guilty of a misdemeanor. This section shall not apply to any person who is under the influence of nitrous oxide or any material containing nitrous oxide pursuant to an administration for the purpose of medical, surgical, or dental care by a person duly licensed to administer such an agent." 
 
 The city of Rialto, CA passed an ordinance in Mar 2017 making the sale or distribution of nitrous oxide illegal regardless of its intended us with "the exception of sales of the gas for lawful medical and industrial use". Persons violating the ordinance can face jail time, a $1,000 fine or both. See [Rialto passes unique nitrous oxide ordinance aimed at protecting youth](http://www.dailybulletin.com/government-and-politics/20170302/rialto-passes-unique-nitrous-oxide-ordinance-aimed-at-protecting-youth) .
 
Florida #
 
A new 2005 law in Florida makes possession and use of nitrous oxide for inhaling pruposes a second-degree misdemeanor, punishable by 60 days in jail and a $500.00 fine. Selling, purchasing, transferring, or possessing more than 16 grams of nitrous oxide for the purpose of inhaling is now a third-degree felony punishable by five (5) years in prison and a $5,000.00 fine. Florida also closed a loophole that allowed nitrous oxide and nitrous oxide paraphernalia (used to store, transfer, or inhale nitrous oxide) to be sold in tobacco shops. Now the use or possession with intent to use such nitrous oxide paraphernalia is a first-degree misdemeanor punishable by one (1) year in jail and a $1,000.00 fine. See [Florida State Statute Title XLVI Chapter 877.111](http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&Search_String=&URL=Ch0877/SEC111.HTM&Title=-%3E2001-%3ECh0877-%3ESection%20111) . (thanks D5)
 
Oregon #
 
Oregon controls Nitrous Oxide as an inhalant under [Chapter 229, section 1.](http://www.leg.state.or.us/99orlaws/sess0200.dir/0229ses.html) It makes the possession of inhalants illegal "for the purpose of inducing intoxication".
 
INTERNATIONAL LAW #
 
Australia #
 
We believe that as of July 1, 2004, Australia now adds a number of police powers for searching and detaining individuals under 18 and seizing "volatile inhalants" from them. The Oct 2004 [Australian Government Institute of Criminology](http://www.aic.gov.au/research/drugs/types/inhalants.html) seems to have out of date information and doesn not mention the new rule. More up to date information can be found at the [Australian Drug Info Clearinghouse](http://www.druginfo.adf.org.au/article.asp?id=8053&ContainerID=561) . 
 
 Australian rules now are that police may search and detain (not arrest) anyone under 18 who they suspect of using inhalants. The police are to free the young person once they are no longer a danger to themselves or others. It is not entirely clear if this rule includes Nitrous Oxide, but this seems to be the assumption.
 
Brazil #
 
Nitrous is legal for medical use only, but is available for purchase over the internet. (unconfirmed) (thanks P)
 
Canada #
 
Nitrous chargers widely available over-the-counter. We have been told that many stores will only sell to people 25 and older. Other visitors describe buying whipe-cream chargers without being asked for ID. (unconfirmed) (thanks J) (last updated Sep 24, 2015)
 
Korea #
 
In July 2017, the Republic of Korea Ministry of Environment banned the inhalation, sales or possession of nitrous for inhalation purposes, with infractions punishable by three years in prison or a fine of up to 50 million won (~$44,762), the ministry said. See [Govt. bans abuse of nitrous oxide](http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20170725000401) .
 
Netherlands #
 
Nitrous chargers are widely available over-the-counter. The use of nitrous oxide for recreational purposes is legal (not prohibited). Nitrous oxide is legally sold to the general public for food use, though it is technically illegal to sell for recreational use (it is considered a prescription medicine when inhaled). Many stores regularly sell to people under 18. (thanks K, LB) (last updated Oct 11, 2012)
 
New Zealand #
 
In April, 2005, the New Zealand Ministry of Health reviewed the use of Nitrous Oxide and declared that much of the importation, sale, and possession was for "misuse" and in violation of the Medicines Act of 1981. Nitrous Oxide whip cream chargers have become difficult to buy over-the-counter as of May 1, 2005. See [Ministry of Health Background Information on Nitrous Oxide](http://www.moh.govt.nz/moh.nsf/0/2bf754585cd67838cc256fe700044e36?OpenDocument) and [Scoop.co.nz](http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/GE0504/S00083.htm) .
 
U.K. #
 
Nitrous Oxide is widely available in the United Kingdom. In the UK possesion of nitrous for non-inhalant use is not controlled and is legal. It is illegal to sell or provide nitrous oxide to someone under 18 years old "if he knows or has reasonable cause to believe that the substance is, or its fumes are, likely to be inhaled by the person under the age of eighteen for the purpose of causing intoxication.". See [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1985/26/section/1](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1985/26/section/1) . One visitor tells us the law is only only enforced against locations such as night clubs that sell or allow to be sold nitrous oxide and have been warned by authorities. (thanks D) (last updated Jan 24, 2013)
 
Nitrous oxide is controlled differerently around the world. A few countries control it as a pharmaceutical, while many allow its possession for food uses without any licensing.
