## SYNTHESIS
A solution of LAH (96 mL of 1 M solution in THF) was cooled, under He, to 0 Â°C with an external ice bath. With good stirring there was added 2.4 mL 100% H2SO4 dropwise, to minimize charring. This was followed by the addition of 10.8 g 1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylphenyl)-1-methoxy-2-nitroethane. There was immediate discoloration. After the addition was complete, the reaction mixture was held at reflux on the steam bath for 2 h. After cooling again, the excess hydride was destroyed with 4 mL IPA and the reaction mixture made basic with 15% NaOH. The insoluble inorganic salts were removed by filtration, and the filter cake was washed first with THF, and then with IPA. The bright yellow filtrate and washes were pooled and stripped of solvent under vacuum, yielding 14 g of a yellow oil. This was suspended in 1 L dilute H2SO4 to give an ugly, cloudy, yellow-orange mess. Extraction with 3Ã75 mL CH2Cl2 removed much of the color, and the remaining aqueous phase was made basic with 25% NaOH, and extracted with 3Ã75 mL CH2Cl2. Evaporation of the solvent under vacuum gave 9 g of a pale amber oil which was distilled at 115â130 Â°C at 0.4 mm/Hg. The water-white distillate was dissolved in 15 mL IPA, neutralized with concentrated HCl, and then diluted with 70 mL anhydrous Et2O. After a few min, white crystals formed, and these were removed by filtration and Et2O washed. When air-dried to constant weight, 4.49 g brilliant white crystals of 4-methyl-2,5,Î²-trimethoxyphenethylamine hydrochloride (BOD) with a mp of 171â172 Â°C with decomposition, were obtained. The mother liquors on standing deposited 0.66 g additional crystals which were impure and were discarded. Anal. (C12H20ClNO3) C,H.


## DOSAGE

## DURATION

## QUALITATIVE COMMENTS
(with 20 mg) âFor the first three or so hours, the beauty of the experience was marred by a strange discomfort. There was some queasiness, and I felt a sluggishness of mind. Then I began moving in and out of a pleasant place, and finally the discomfort completely dissolved and the experience turned full on. Height of beauty, visual perception. Lights below are amazing. Outside, marvelous sense of Presence. There is not an elation, as often with other materials, but a strong, even powerful sense of goodness, inner strength, solidity.â

(with 25 mg) âThis was quite quick. The onset of the experience was apparent within a half hour, and we were both at +++ within the hour. Body load minimal. There was very little visual, compared with some materials. Very interesting eyes-closed, but not continuallyâjust now and then an intense vision might flash. Very benign and friendly and pleasant and good-humored feeling. Superb for conversation and conceptualization.â

(with 25 mg) âThe body load was quite noticeable for everyone. But the general state of mind was excellent; everyone was extremely relaxed and funny. Puns, insults, delightful amusement. Not very much insight work possible. Juices were needed and tolerated well, but no one was particularly hungry. Sleep was difficult for most people, not deep and not too refreshing. Excellent material, but body price a bit too much for the mental effects. Pleasant, and I wouldnât hesitate to take it again, but nothing very memorable except the tremendous humor and laughter, which was truly delightful.â


## EXTENSIONS AND COMMENTARY
Actually, the concept of naming of drugs with some acronym that is pronounceable has led into some interesting byways. Some examples have been unintended. I have heard DOM pronounced âdomeâ and DOET pronounced as âdo it.â And elsewhere I have mentioned the embarrassing occasions where the TOM and TOET families were pronounced âthe toms and twats.â Some examples have had names that have been contractions of popular names, such as XTC for ecstasy. And there are instances where a name might be proposed simply to irritate the newspaper people. An early street suggestion for PCP was FUK, and a current name for free-base methamphetamine is SNOT. And marijuana is fondly called SHIT by its aficionados. The final âAâ on government groups such as the CIA or the DEA or the FDA is strongly reminscent of the final âAâ which stands for amphetamine in things such as TMA and MDMA. Might there someday be a drug such as 4-cyclopropylmethyl-N-isopropylamphetamine (CIA), or 3,5-dimethoxy-4-ethylamphetamine (DEA)? It has just occurred to me that there is already a 4-fluoro-2,5-dimethoxyamphetamine (FDA), but I have already named it DOF. If all drugs were known only by publicly embarrassing names, there might be less publicity given them by the press.

Back to the commentary on BOD. The rationale for this inclusion of a beta-oxygen atom into the structure of a phenethylamine is based directly on the chemistry that occurs naturally in the brain. The phenethylamine neurotransmitter, dopamine, is converted both in the brain and in the body to the equally important transmitter norepinephrine  by just this sort of transformation. There is the enzymatic addition of an oxygen atom to the âbenzylicâ position of dopamine. And identical chemistry goes on with tyramine in a number of plants and animals, with a similar addition of oxygen to form octopamine, so-named for its discovered presence in the salivary glands of Octopus vulgaris. In the first explorations in the âOXâ series, this oxygen was intentionally blocked with a methyl group, to ease its entry into the brain, and increase the possibilities of its being active as a psychedelic. As mentioned above, the âDâ in âODâ follows from its ring orientation pattern being the same as that of 2C-D (and this, originally from the mimicking of the pattern of DOM). All of these D- compounds have the 2,5-dimethoxy-4-methyl ring-substitution pattern.

An interesting complication is also part of this structure package. The added methoxy group (or hydroxy group, see recipe for BOHD) also adds a new asymmetric center, allowing for the eventual separation of the material into two optical isomers. And at such time as the corresponding amphetamine homologues might be made and studied, the presence of yet another chiral center (under the alpha-methyl group) will demand that there be actually two racemic compounds synthesized, and a total of four isomers to contend with, if really careful and thorough work is to be done.

A parallel chemistry to all of this follows the addition of sodium ethoxide (rather than sodium methoxide) to the nitrostyrene. The final product, then, is the ethoxy homologue 2,5-dimethoxy-Î²-ethoxy-4-methylphenethylamine, or BOED. It is down in human potency by a factor of three, with a normal dosage being 70â75 milligrams. It has a ten hour duration, and is both anorexic and diuretic. There have been no visual effects or insights reported, but rather simply a highly intoxicated state.

Two synonyms, two definitions, and an expression of admiration. The word norepinephrine  is synonymous with noradrenalin, and the word epinephrine  is synonymous with adrenalin. The distinctions are that the first in each case is American and the second British. And the term âchiralâ indicates a potential asymmetry in a molecule that would allow eventual separation into two optical isomers. The term âracemicâ refers to a mixture of these two isomers which has not yet been separated into the individual components. A racemic mixture is called a racemate and, from the point of view of the human animal (which is completely asymmetric), must be considered as a mixture of two structurally identical but optically mirror-image isomers, which can be potentially separated and which will certainly have different pharmacologies. And the admiration? This is directed to the explorer who ventured close enough to an octopus to locate its salivary glands and to discover a phenethylamine there!

## Summary
2,5-Dimethoxy-4-bromoamphetamine (DOB), also known as brolamfetamine (INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name), is a psychedelic drug of the phenethylamine, amphetamine, and DOx families. For many years, prior to the discovery of newer compounds, DOB was the most potent known phenethylamine psychedelic. It is taken orally.
The drug acts as an agonist of the serotonin 5-HT2 receptors, including of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor. Analogues of DOB include 2C-B, DOM, DOI, and Bromo-DragonFLY (DOB-DFLY), among others.
DOB was first synthesized by Alexander Shulgin in 1967 and was described by him and his colleagues in the scientific literature in 1971. Shulgin subsequently further described the effects of DOB in his 1991 book PiHKAL (Phenethylamines I Have Known and Loved).

## Use and effects
In his book PiHKAL (Phenethylamines I Have Known and Loved), Alexander Shulgin lists DOB's dose as 1 to 3 mg orally and its duration as 18 to 30 hours. In an earlier publication, he listed its dose as 2 to 3 mg for racemic DOB and 1 to 2 mg for the preferentially active (R)-DOB enantiomer. In addition, he described the duration as being extremely long, with a gradual descent and baseline being achieved after 24 to 36 hours. The onset has been described as 1 to 2 hours, the time to peak as 3 or 4 hours, and a plateau occurring from 4 to 10 hours. Its onset is said to be relatively slow.
The effects of DOB and (R)-DOB have been reported to include visual changes such as prismatic-colored rings around the moon and long-lasting "after-images" following seeing points of light, little visual distortion, an "incredible Moebius strip representation of reality at the intellectual level", rich fantasy, flashes of depersonalization, cosmic thinking, introspection, insights, intoxication, impairment, stimulation, brief lapses in attention or "little fugue states", body load, cramps, muscle tremors, and sleep disruption. At a low dose of 0.4 mg DOB, there was only enhanced visual perception, strengthening of colors, enriched emotional affect, a comfortable good feeling, and colorful and important dreams.
(R)-DOB produced moderate effects at a dose of 0.5 mg and pronounced effects at 1.0 to 1.5 mg, whereas there were no effects with 0.5 mg (S)-DOB and only threshold and very slight effects with 1.0 mg (S)-DOB. In relation to this, (R)-DOB is described as the more active enantiomer and (S)-DOB as much less active. In one report, 1 mg (R)-DOB was described as not as strong as 2 mg DOB, suggesting that it is more potent than the racemate but is not double its potency and hence that (S)-DOB also contributes to the effects of the racemate. (S)-DOB has never been tested up to fully active doses. In another source however, by Richard Glennon and colleagues, the approximate hallucinogenic dose was listed as 0.8 to 2.0 mg for racemic DOB, 0.5 mg for (R)-DOB, and 5.0 mg for (S)-DOB.

## Side effects
Side effects of DOB include body load, muscle tremors, muscle cramps, attention lapses described as "little fugue states", sleeping difficulties, and bizarre dreams.

## Overdose
Overdose of DOB has been reported to produce cardiovascular symptoms and convulsions. Excessively high doses of DOB may cause diffuse arterial spasm. The vasospasm responded readily to intra-arterial and intravenous vasodilators, such as tolazoline. A 35 mg overdose resulted in death, while a 75 mg overdose in a person with tolerance resulted in ergotism-like complications that required amputation.

## Interactions
DOB may interact synergistically with alcohol.

### Pharmacodynamics
DOB is a serotonin 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, and 5-HT2C receptor agonist. Its psychedelic effects are mediated by its agonistic properties at the 5-HT2A receptor. Due to its selectivity, DOB is often used in scientific research when studying the 5-HT2 receptor subfamily.
It is a very weak agonist of the human trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1) and a weak agonist of the rhesus monkey TAAR1. In contrast to the serotonin releasing agent MDMA, DOB does not produce protein kinase C (PKC) activation in the brains of rodents in vivo. The PKC activation by MDMA appears to be dependent on uptake by the serotonin transporter (SERT).
DOB has been found to reduce aggression in rats.
DOB is one of the most potent compounds in PiHKAL; while the active dose is similar to that of DOI, another psychedelic amphetamine, DOB has been shown to have a higher efficacy in triggering downstream effects mediated by serotonin 5-HT2 receptors.

## Chemistry
The full name of the chemical is 2,5-dimethoxy-4-bromoamphetamine. DOB has a stereocenter and R-(−)-DOB is the eutomer. This is an important finding as it is suggestive that it is targeting different receptors relative to most other phenethylamines (e.g. MDMA) where the R-isomer serves as the distomer.

### Synthesis
The chemical synthesis of DOB has been described.

### Analogues
Omission of the amphetamine related α-methyl leads to 2C-B, a compound that possesses a lower affinity for the 5-HT2A receptor and is a weaker receptor agonist. Other analogues of DOB include 4C-B, Bromo-DragonFLY, DOB-FLY, DOB-5-hemiFLY, and 25B-NBOMe, among others.

## History
DOB was first synthesized by Alexander Shulgin in 1967. It was first described in the scientific literature in a paper by Shulgin, Claudio Naranjo, and another colleague in 1971. The INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name of DOB, brolamfetamine, was proposed and recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 1986. This was the same year that the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) was founded. DOB was registered with the WHO as a supposed "anorexic" (appetite suppressant).

### Legal status
Internationally, DOB is a Schedule I substance under the Convention on Psychotropic Substances and the drug is legal only for medical, industrial or scientific purposes.

#### Canada
Listed as a Schedule 1 as it is an analogue of amphetamine.

#### Australia
DOB is considered a Schedule 9 prohibited substance in Australia under the Poisons Standard (February 2017). A Schedule 9 substance is a substance which may be abused or misused, the manufacture, possession, sale or use of which should be prohibited by law except when required for medical or scientific research, or for analytical, teaching or training purposes with approval of Commonwealth and/or State or Territory Health Authorities.

#### Russia
Schedule I, possession of at least 10 mg is a criminal offence.

#### United Kingdom
DOB is a Class A drug in the United Kingdom under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971.

#### United States
DOB is a Schedule I controlled substance under federal law in the United States. It was scheduled in 1973.
