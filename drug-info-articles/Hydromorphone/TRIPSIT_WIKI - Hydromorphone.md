# Hydromorphone

*Source: https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/Hydromorphone*

**Hydromorphone**, a more common synonym for dihydromorphinone (not to be confused by dihydromorphine, which is a different derivative of the morphine family), commonly a hydrochloride (brand names Palladone, Dilaudid, and numerous others). It's a semi-synthetic opioid.

## History

Knoll introduced it to the mass market in 1926 under the brand name Dilaudid, indicating its derivation and degree of similarity to morphine (by way of laudanum). The brand name Dilaudid is more widely known than the generic term hydromorphone, and because of this, Dilaudid is often used generically to mean any form of hydromorphone.
