Phencyclidine (PCP) is a dissociative anesthetic which entered the market ~60 years ago as a medical drug, but most of its use has occurred in other settings. It’s a member of the arylcyclohexylamine class and it functions as an NMDA antagonist and a D2 partial agonist.

When compared to other dissociatives, PCP is more likely to produce psychosis. According to studies on the drug, agitation or hallucinations occurred in up to 50% of patients given anesthetic doses. And, it also resulted in greater mental issues in ~17% of those given anesthetic doses.

High doses have been associated with dangerous psychotic states. This isn’t a typical response, but it’s certainly possible, particularly when large amounts are used.

Neurotoxicity is a concern with PCP and while it’s controversial, it’s best to use the drug infrequently and avoid high doses.
