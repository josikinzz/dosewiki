*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1,3-Butanediol*

1,3-Butanediol is an  organic compound with the formula CH3CH(OH)CH2CH2OH, not to be confused with 1,4 Butanediol. With two alcohol functional groups, the molecule is classified as a diol. The compound without the R (or D) designation is racemic, which is what has been used in most studies before 2023. The compound is a colorless, bittersweet, water-soluble liquid. It is one of four common structural isomers of butanediol. It is used in grape flavoring, and as a precursor to some antibiotics.

## Production and uses

Hydrogenation of 3-hydroxybutanal gives 1,3-butanediol:

CH3CH(OH)CH2CHO  +  H2  →  CH3CH(OH)CH2CH2OH
Dehydration of 1,3-butanediol gives 1,3-butadiene:

CH3CH(OH)CH2CH2OH  →  CH2=CH-CH=CH2  +  2 H2O

## Pharmacology

1,3-Butanediol has sedative, hypotensive and hypoglycaemic action comparable to ethanol, with the (R), also known as (D), enantiomer being more active. Fatty acid esters of 1,3-butanediol such as the acetoacetate, lactate or hexanoate have been researched for inducing ketogenesis. Recent research highlights the stereospecific metabolism of (R)-1,3-butanediol, emphasizing its efficient conversion to β-hydroxybutyrate via alcohol dehydrogenase. This process involves zinc coordination and maintains cellular redox balance. Notably, (R)-1,3-butanediol induces mild euphoric effects through ketone body signaling pathways, distinct from the GABAergic mechanisms associated with ethanol.

## Occurrence

1,3-Butanediol has been detected in green bell peppers, orange bell peppers, pepper (Capsicum annuum), red bell peppers, and yellow bell peppers. 1,3 Butanediol, | quote = Also referred to as 1,3-Butylene glycol, maintains FDA GRAS status as a flavor molecule.

## Biochemistry

The metabolism of (R)-1,3-butanediol is compartmentalized within hepatic cells, occurring in both cytosolic and mitochondrial domains. Enzymatic studies have quantified the distribution of alcohol dehydrogenase isoforms involved in its conversion to β-hydroxybutyrate, underscoring the molecule's potential in therapeutic ketone body production.
