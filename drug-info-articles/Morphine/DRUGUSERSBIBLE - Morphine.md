## Subjective Experience

Extracted from the opium poppy, morphine has a long history of medicinal use, and
indeed, recreational abuse. By including it in this book, however, I cannot deny that I
feel somewhat fraudulent. Yes, I have experienced it, but not recreationally: it was
administered courtesy of the NHS, in the Royal Liverpool University Hospital.

I was 21, had recently had my tonsils removed, when I was rushed back to the
infirmary due to re-bleeding. On being injected with an unknown dose, presumably
to calm my distress and agitation, a semi-euphoric mood lift immediately engulfed
me.

It did its job medically, and was extremely pleasant: so much so that I harbour the
embarrassing recollection that I may have asked for more.

Notwithstanding this, and despite its wide scale use in this context, this isn’t a drug
to approach with anything other than extreme caution. Heed the warnings provided
in the entries for the other opioids and more generally. It is highly addictive and
ultimately destructive.
