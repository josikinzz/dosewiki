*Source: https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB06714*

## Overview

### Description

This compound belongs to the class of organic compounds known as dialkylamines. These are organic compounds containing a dialkylamine group, characterized by two alkyl groups bonded to the amino nitrogen.

### Background

Propylhexedrine is an alpha-adrenergic agonist often used in nasal decongestant inhalers. It is used to give temporary relief for nasal congestion from colds, allergic rhinitis, or allergies.

### Indication

It is used to provide temporary symptomatic relief of nasal congestion due to colds, allergies and allergic rhinitis.

### Pharmacodynamics

Like other monoamine releasing stimulants propylhexedrine is active as a norepinephrine and dopamine releaser in the central nervous system. The acute effects of the drug closely resemble the physiological and psychological effects of an epinephrine-provoked fight-or-flight response, including increased heart rate and blood pressure, vasoconstriction (constriction of the arterial walls), bronchodilation, and hyperglycemia (increased blood sugar).

### Mechanism of Action

Synaptic vesicular amine transporter
Antagonist

### Toxicity

The signs and symptoms that are produced after the acute overdosage of Propylhexidrine include Psychosis, Burning sensation.

### Mechanism of action

Propylhexidrine causes the norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin (5HT) transporters to reverse their direction of flow. This inversion leads to a release of these transmitters from the vesicles to the cytoplasm and from the cytoplasm to the synapse. It also antagonizes the action of VMAT2, causing the release of more neurotransmitters.

### General Function

Intracellular G-protein coupled receptor for trace amines, which recognizes endogenous amine-containing metabolites such as beta-phenylethylamine (beta-PEA), 3-iodothyronamine (T1AM), isoamylamine (IAA), cadaverine (CAD), cyclohexylamine (CHA), p-tyramine (p-TYR), trimethylamine (TMA), octopamine and tryptamine (PubMed:11459929, PubMed:11723224, PubMed:15718104, PubMed:31399635, PubMed:36100653, PubMed:37935376, PubMed:37935377, PubMed:37963465, PubMed:38168118). Also functions as a receptor for various drugs and psychoactive substances, such as amphetamine and methamphetamine (PubMed:31399635, PubMed:37935376, PubMed:37935377). Unresponsive to classical biogenic amines, such as epinephrine and histamine and only partially activated by dopamine and serotonin (PubMed:11459929, PubMed:11723224). Expressed in both the central and peripheral nervous system: TAAR1 activation regulates the activity of several neurotransmitter signaling pathways by (1) decreasing the basal firing rates of the neurons involved and by (2) lowering the sensitivity of receptors to neurotransmitters (PubMed:37935376, PubMed:37935377, PubMed:37963465, PubMed:38168118). Ligand binding causes a conformation change that triggers signaling via guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) and modulates the activity of downstream effectors (PubMed:31399635, PubMed:37935376, PubMed:37963465). TAAR1 is coupled with different G(i)/G(o)-, G(s)- or G(q)/G(11) classes of G alpha proteins depending on the ligand (PubMed:31399635, PubMed:37935376, PubMed:37963465). CAD-binding is coupled to G(i)/G(o) G alpha proteins and mediates inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity (PubMed:37935376, PubMed:37963465). T1AM- or beta-PEA-binding is coupled to G(s) G alpha proteins and mediates activation of adenylate cyclase activity (PubMed:37935376, PubMed:37963465). CHA- or IAA-binding is coupled to G(q)/G(11) G alpha proteins and activates phospholipase C-beta, releasing diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) second messengers (PubMed:37935376, PubMed:37963465). TMA-binding is coupled with all three G(i)/G(o)-, G(s)- or G(q)/G(11) G alpha protein subtypes (PubMed:37935376, PubMed:37963465). Amphetamine-binding is coupled with G(s)- or G(12)/G(13) G alpha protein subtypes (PubMed:31399635)
