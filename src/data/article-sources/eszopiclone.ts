## Overview

### Description

This compound belongs to the class of organic compounds known as cyclopyrrolones. These are compounds belonging to a family of pyridin-2-ylpyrrole based chemicals. The pyrrole is usually fused to a benzene, pyrimidine, or dithiin.

### Background

Eszopiclone, marketed by Sepracor under the brand-name Lunesta, is a nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic drug used to treat insomnia. It is the active stereoisomer of zopiclone, belonging to the class of drugs known as
cyclopyrrolones
.
1
,
12
Cyclopyrrolone drugs demonstrate high efficacy and low toxicity
9
, offering a safer alternative to other drugs used for insomnia.
One major benefit of eszopiclone is that it is approved by the FDA for the long-term treatment of insomnia. This sets it apart from many other hypnotic sedatives, which are generally approved only for the relief of short-term (6-8 weeks) insomnia. Eszopiclone was initially approved by the FDA in 2004.
10

### Indication

Eszopiclone is indicated for the treatment of insomnia.
10

### Pharmacodynamics

Eszopiclone rapidly induces sleep and decreases sleep latency. It also aids in the maintenance of sleep, preventing frequent awakenings.
3
,
4
,
10
This drug has shown anticonvulsant and muscle relaxant properties in animals but is used in humans for its sedating effects.
9
Eszopiclone is a central nervous system depressant with various effects. These include changes in alertness and motor coordination and the risk of next morning impairment, increasing with the amount of eszopiclone administered.  Exercise caution and advise against driving a motor vehicle or activities that require full mental alertness the next morning.
10
Complex sleep behaviors may result from eszopiclone use. Eszopiclone should be discontinued in these cases.
15
Avoid the use of alcohol and other CNS depressants when eszopiclone is administered. Advise patients to skip the eszopiclone dose if alcohol has been consumed before bed or during the evening. Use the smallest dose of eszopiclone as possible, especially in elderly patients, who may experience exaggerated drug effects. Though the potential for dependence and abuse with eszopiclone is lower than for other hypnotic drugs, this drug has been abused and is known to cause dependence.
14

### Mechanism of Action

Gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor subunit alpha-1
Modulator
GABA(A) Receptor
Positive allosteric modulator

### Absorption

Eszopiclone is rapidly absorbed and the peak concentration is reached within about 1 hour after oral administration.
3
,
10
The mean AUC after a 3 mg dose of eszopiclone was 278 ng/mL × h.
1
The consumption of a high-fat has been shown to slow absorption.  Steady-state concentrations of eszopiclone are reached within 24-48 hours.
4

### Metabolism

Following oral administration, eszopiclone is extensively biotransformed and the major metabolites are S-desmethylzopiclone and zopiclone-N-oxide, which are largely inactive.
2
. The enzymes involved in the metabolism of eszopiclone are CYP3A (the primary metabolizing enzyme), CYP2C8, and CYP2E1.
2
The N-oxide derivative shows weak pharmacological activity in animals. The N-desmethyl metabolite is pharmacologically active.

### Half-life

The half-life is 6.1 hours in healthy patients but is prolonged in various patients, including those with hepatic impairment, elderly patients, in addition to those taking CYP3A enzyme inhibiting drugs.
1
,
10

### Toxicity

The oral LD50 of eszopiclone in rats is 980 mg/kg and 3200 mg/kg in rabbits.
13
Symptoms of overdose may include mental status changes and somnolence, demonstrating general exaggeration of the drug's pharmacological effects. Perform gastric lavage and offer supportive treatment if an overdose is suspected, including intravenous fluids as required. Flumazenil may be used. Vital signs should be closely monitored in addition to patient symptoms. Appropriate medical interventions should be employed. The possibility of an overdose with multiple drugs should be considered. Ensure to contact the local poison control center for the most updated management of hypnotic drug overdose.
10

### Drug Interactions

This information should not be interpreted without the help of a healthcare provider. If you believe you are experiencing an interaction, contact a healthcare provider immediately. The absence of an interaction does not necessarily mean no interactions exist.

1,2-Benzodiazepine
The risk or severity of CNS depression can be increased when 1,2-Benzodiazepine is combined with Eszopiclone.
Abacavir
Eszopiclone may decrease the excretion rate of Abacavir which could result in a higher serum level.
Abametapir
The serum concentration of Eszopiclone can be increased when it is combined with Abametapir.
Abatacept
The metabolism of Eszopiclone can be increased when combined with Abatacept.
Abiraterone
The metabolism of Eszopiclone can be decreased when combined with Abiraterone.

### Food Interactions

Avoid alcohol.
Do not take with or immediately after a high-fat meal. This decreases the absorption of eszopiclone.

### Mechanism of action

The exact mechanism of action of eszopiclone is unknown at this time but is thought to occur via binding with the GABA receptor complexes at binding sites located near benzodiazepine receptors, possibly explaining its hypnotic and sedative effects.
3
,
10
It has particular affinity for GABA-A (or GABAA) receptor subunits 1, 3 and 5.
5
,
6
,
7
Eszopiclone increases GABA-A channel currents significantly.

### Protein binding

This drug is 52-59% bound to plasma proteins.
10

### Route of elimination

Only about 10% of an eszopiclone dose is found excreted in the urine as the parent drug.
3
,
10
As much as 75% of an orally administered dose of racemic zopiclone as is found to be excreted in the urine in the form of metabolites.  Eszopiclone, the S-isomer of racemic zopiclone, would likely show the same excretion pattern.
10

### Clearance

The mean clearance of eszopiclone in young, healthy volunteers was 184 mL/min in one pharmacokinetic study.

### General Function

A cytochrome P450 monooxygenase involved in the metabolism of various endogenous substrates, including fatty acids, steroid hormones and vitamins (PubMed:11093772, PubMed:14559847, PubMed:15766564, PubMed:19965576, PubMed:7574697). Mechanistically, uses molecular oxygen inserting one oxygen atom into a substrate, and reducing the second into a water molecule, with two electrons provided by NADPH via cytochrome P450 reductase (NADPH--hemoprotein reductase) (PubMed:11093772, PubMed:14559847, PubMed:15766564, PubMed:19965576, PubMed:7574697). Primarily catalyzes the epoxidation of double bonds of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) with a preference for the last double bond (PubMed:15766564, PubMed:19965576, PubMed:7574697). Catalyzes the hydroxylation of carbon-hydrogen bonds. Metabolizes all trans-retinoic acid toward its 4-hydroxylated form (PubMed:11093772). Displays 16-alpha hydroxylase activity toward estrogen steroid hormones, 17beta-estradiol (E2) and estrone (E1) (PubMed:14559847). Plays a role in the oxidative metabolism of xenobiotics. It is the principal enzyme responsible for the metabolism of the anti-cancer drug paclitaxel (taxol) (PubMed:26427316)

*Note: Erowid catalogs Eszopiclone under the Zopiclone vault, as Eszopiclone is the active S-isomer of Zopiclone.*

## Overview

Zopiclone is a short-acting sedative-hypnotic medication used for short-term insomnia treatment. It belongs to a drug class called cyclopyrrolones and operates on similar receptor sites as benzodiazepines. The medication became available in Europe in 1989 and in the U.S. as eszopiclone (its active S-isomer) in 2005.

## Classification

- **Class:** Hypnotic; Sleep-aid
- **Mechanism:** CNS depressant acting on benzodiazepine-like receptors

## Brand Names

- Imovane
- Lunesta (eszopiclone)
- Zimovane

## Distinctive Characteristics

Unlike related medications (zolpidem, zaleplon), zopiclone is notably associated with causing "a metallic taste in the mouth."

## Health & Addiction

Dependence potential exists with this substance. Resources on zopiclone addiction and withdrawal considerations are available, indicating that tolerance and withdrawal symptoms can occur with regular use.

## Legal Status

The DEA proposed moving zopiclone to Schedule IV classification (referenced in a February 2005 document).

## Related Substances

- Zolpidem (Ambien)
- Benzodiazepines

## Dosage & Duration

### Oral

**Dosage:**
- Bioavailability: 52 - 80%[citation needed]
- Threshold: .5 mg
- Light: 1 - 1.5 mg
- Common: 2 - 3 mg
- Strong: 4 - 5 mg
- Heavy: 6 mg +

**Duration:**
- Total: 6 - 8 hours
- Onset: 10 - 20 minutes
- Peak: 30 - 90 minutes
**Fatal [overdose](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Overdose) may occur when [GABAergic substances](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GABA#GABA_receptors) are combined with other [depressants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressants) such as [opiates](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opiates) , [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) , [barbiturates](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Barbiturates) , [gabapentinoids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Gabapentinoids) , [thienodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thienodiazepines) or [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) .**
 
It is strongly discouraged to combine these substances, particularly in [common](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Common) to [heavy](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Heavy) doses.
**Eszopiclone** (also known by the trade names **Lunesta** ) is a non- [benzodiazepine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine) [hypnotic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hypnotic) substance of the [cyclopyrrolone](/w/index.php?title=Cyclopyrrolone&action=edit&redlink=1) class that is primarily used in the treatment of [insomnia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Insomnia) . Eszopiclone is known to belong to a family of drugs colloquially known as "Z-drugs". Other Z-drugs include [Zopiclone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Zopiclone) ( *Imovane* ) [zaleplon](/w/index.php?title=Zaleplon&action=edit&redlink=1) ( *Sonata* ) and [zolpidem](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Zolpidem) ( *Ambien* and *AmbienCR* ).

Eszopiclone is thought to increase the normal neurotransmission of the [neurotransmitter](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurotransmitter) [GABA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GABA) in the central nervous system in a similar yet distinct way to the activity of [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) . As Eszopiclone displays heavy [sedating](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation) effects, it is has been approved for and is commonly sold as a sleeping pill. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

While "Z-drugs" were initially thought to have less misuse potential than benzodiazepines, this appraisal has shifted somewhat in the last few years as a number of cases of addiction and habituation have been observed. Eszopiclone, like all "Z-drugs", is recommended to be taken on a short-term basis -- usually a week or less. Daily or continuous use of the drug is usually not advised.

## Chemistry

Eszopiclone is a hypnotic nonbenzodiazepine drug of the cyclopyrrolone class. Eszopiclone is the dextrorotatory S-stereoisomer of [zopiclone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Zopiclone) ( *Imovane* ). Eszopiclone and zopiclone are the most popular and available cyclopyrrolone drugs. This class of drugs is named for having a pyrrolone core, a five-membered ring with a nitrogen constituent (pyrrole) and a ketone group (-one).

## Pharmacology

Eszopiclone, although structurally different from [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) , shares an almost identical pharmacological profile to them. Its mechanism of action works by binding to the same site as benzodiazepines and acts as a full agonist, which in turn positively modulates benzodiazepine-sensitive [GABAA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GABA) [receptors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Receptor) and enhances GABA binding at the [GABAA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GABA) receptors to produce Eszopiclone's subjective effects. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] Since GABA functions as the brain's predominant inhibitory [neurotransmitter](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurotransmitter) , this activation of receptors results in the [sedative](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation) and [anxiolytic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety_suppression) effects of Eszopiclone. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

## Subjective effects

In comparison to other substances of a similar nature such as [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) , Eszopiclone is commonly reported to present significantly more [amnesic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amnesia) and [disinhibiting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Disinhibition) effects in a manner similar to [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) .
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation)** - Eszopiclone is extremely sedating and can put the user into an overwhelmingly lethargic state. At higher levels, this causes users to suddenly feel as if they are extremely sleep deprived and have not slept for days, forcing them to sit or lay down and feel as if they are constantly on the verge of passing out. This sense of sleep deprivation increases proportional to dosage and can eventually become powerful enough to force a person into complete unconsciousness regardless of where they are or what they are doing at that moment.
- **[Respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression)**
- **[Muscle relaxation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_relaxation)**
- **[Dizziness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dizziness)**
- **[Motor control loss](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motor_control_loss)** - This effect is pronounced and comparable to the motor control loss experienced on a heavy dose of alcohol. This typically results in users stumbling and an inability to walk in a straight line. As this may easily result in injury, one should avoid walking and using stairs while on Eszopiclone.
- **[Gustatory hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Gustatory_hallucination)** - Eszopiclone is commonly reported to leave a strong, unpleasant metallic taste in one's mouth.
- **[Euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Euphoria)** - Some users report [euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Euphoria) from Eszopiclone, although this is short lived and usually exclusive to the onset of the experience and often followed by [emotion suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Emotion_suppression) .
- **[Emotion suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Emotion_suppression)** - While Eszopiclone primarily suppresses [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , it also suppresses other emotions in a similar but less intense fashion to [antipsychotics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antipsychotics) .
- **[Time compression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Time_distortion)** - This effect is mostly noticeable while under the influence of a high dose.
- **[Irritability](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Irritability)** - Combined with the strong disinhibiting effects of Eszopiclone, this effect can cause people under the influence of Eszopiclone to have violent behavior towards others and sometimes themselves.
- **[Compulsive redosing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Compulsive_redosing)** ### Visual effects
 
- - **[Shadow people](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Shadow_people)**
- **[Acuity suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Acuity_suppression)**
- **[Drifting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_drifting)** *( [melting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_drifting#Melting) , [breathing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_drifting#Breathing) , [morphing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_drifting#Morphing) and [flowing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_drifting#Flowing) )* - Visual drifting effects are the most prominent visual effects of this substance. They typically occur at strong doses, or when the user resists the urge to sleep.. They are similar to the distortions produced [zolpidem](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Zolpidem) and are usually less pronounced than those of [deliriants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Deliriants) . Like deliriant visuals, they are most prominent in low lighting. Depending on dose and lighting, they can be described as slow or fast in speed, static in permanence, smooth in motion, realistic in appearance, and simplistic or intricate.
- **[External hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/External_hallucinations)** - At very high doses, Eszopiclone can produce [external hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/External_hallucinations) that are similar to, but less pronounced than those of [deliriants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Deliriants) .
- **[Tracers](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tracers)** - This effect is mild and typically only experienced at high doses. ### Cognitive effects
 
- The cognitive effects of Eszopiclone can be broken down into several components which progressively intensify proportional to dosage. The general head space of Eszopiclone is described by many as one of intense sedation, decreased inhibition and severe amnesia. It produces a large number of cognitive effects typical of most GABA-ergic [depressants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressant) . 
- **[Amnesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amnesia)** - Compared to [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) , Eszopiclone can produce [amnesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amnesia) at much lower doses. One may potentially not remember exactly what happened while under the influence of a common dose. This is usually less intense than the amnesia produced by [zolpidem](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Zolpidem) .
- **[Anxiety suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety_suppression)**
- **[Thought deceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_deceleration)**
- **[Disinhibition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Disinhibition)**
- **[Delusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusion)**
- **[Delirium](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delirium)**
- **[Analysis suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Analysis_suppression)**
- **[Euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Euphoria)** - Some users report [euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Euphoria) from Eszopiclone, although this is short lived and usually exclusive to the onset of the experience and often followed by [emotion suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Emotion_suppression) .
- **[Emotion suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Emotion_suppression)** - While Eszopiclone primarily suppresses [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , it also suppresses other emotions in a similar but less intense fashion to [antipsychotics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antipsychotics) .
- **[Time compression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Time_distortion)** - This effect is mostly noticeable while under the influence of a high dose.
- **[Irritability](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Irritability)** - Combined with the strong disinhibiting effects of Eszopiclone, this effect can cause people under the influence of Eszopiclone to have violent behavior towards others and sometimes themselves.
- **[Increased music appreciation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_music_appreciation)**
- **[Compulsive redosing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Compulsive_redosing)** ### Auditory effects
 
- - **[Auditory hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_hallucinations)** - The auditory hallucinations of Eszopiclone are mostly voices, and appear at higher doses. Sleep deprivation magnifies this effect.
### Experience reports

There are currently no anecdotal reports which describe the effects of this compound within our [experience index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Experience_index) . Additional experience reports can be found here:

- [Erowid Experience Vaults: Eszopiclone](https://www.erowid.org/experiences/subs/exp_Pharms_Zopiclone.shtml)

## Toxicity and harm potential

By itself, Eszopiclone likely has a low toxicity relative to dose. However, it is potentially [lethal](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression) when mixed with [depressants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressants) like [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) , [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) or [opioids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioids) . When combined with one or several of these drugs the already existing chance of a having a "black-out" is significantly increased, leaving the user with very little to no memory of the events that occurred whilst under the influence of Eszopiclone alone or combined with most other CNS depressants. Users have reported taking Eszopiclone in combination with alcohol in an attempt to treat hangovers with varying degrees of success. It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this substance.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

Eszopiclone is extremely physically and psychologically addictive. This compound may have an even greater addictive potential than benzodiazepines. Tolerance will develop to the [sedative](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedative) - [hypnotic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hypnotic) effects within a couple of weeks of daily use. After cessation, the tolerance returns to baseline in 7 - 14 days. Withdrawal symptoms or rebound symptoms may occur after ceasing usage abruptly following a few weeks or longer of steady dosing, and may necessitate a gradual dose reduction. Eszopiclone presents cross-tolerance with all [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) , meaning that after its consumption benzodiazepines and most other [GABAgenic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GABA) depressants will have a reduced effect.Eszopiclone and triazolam in insomnia associated with generalized anxiety disorder. If Eszopiclone has been taken for more than a few weeks, then the medication should be gradually reduced or preferably crossed over to an equivalent dose of [diazepam](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Diazepam) (Valium) which has a much longer half-life, making withdrawal easier. One should then gradually [taper](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Taper) the dose over a period of several months to avoid extremely severe and unpleasant withdrawal symptoms which can last up to two years after withdrawal if the withdrawal is done too abruptly.

### Dangerous interactions

- **[Depressants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressants)** ( *[1,4-Butanediol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/1,4-Butanediol) , [2-methyl-2-butanol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2-methyl-2-butanol) , [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) , [barbiturates](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Barbiturates) , [GHB](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GHB) / [GBL](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GBL) , [methaqualone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methaqualone) , [opioids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioids)* ) - This combination can result in dangerous or even fatal levels of [respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression) . These substances potentiate the [muscle relaxation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_relaxation) , [sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation) and [amnesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amnesia) caused by one another and can lead to unexpected loss of consciousness at high doses. There is also an increased risk of vomiting during unconsciousness and death from the resulting suffocation. If this occurs, users should attempt to fall asleep in the [recovery position](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Recovery_position) or have a friend move them into it.
- **[Dissociatives](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociatives)** - This combination can result in an increased risk of vomiting during unconsciousness and death from the resulting suffocation. If this occurs, users should attempt to fall asleep in the [recovery position](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Recovery_position) or have a friend move them into it.

## Legal status

- **United States:** On Dec 15, 2004, the United States released Eszopiclone as a treatment for insomnia. It is currently a Schedule 4 controlled substance, because it has abuse potential, just as benzodiazepines do. Possession without a prescription can lead to drug charges.

Zopiclone and Eszopiclone (Lunesta) are two very similar nonbenzodiazepine sleep drugs which provide depressant effects. They can be effective for insomnia, at least in the short-term, but they tend to reduce sleep quality.

After taking zopiclone/eszopiclone, you will generally become notably sedated and able to fall asleep. If you remain awake after the initial sleepiness, you may be presented with hallucinatory effects, including basic closed and open-eye visuals.

They also have an emotion-numbing effect and they can reduce inhibition. Sleep-walking, like what is seen with zolpidem, has been reported.

Even after hours of sleep, the drugs can continue to be impairing, so your driving and work output could be affected in the morning with a large dose.

Neither should be combined with other depressants since doing so can increase the chance of dangerous and fatal responses. Both have caused deaths before, but those deaths have occurred at very high doses.

*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eszopiclone*

Eszopiclone, sold under the brand name Lunesta among others, is a nonbenzodiazepine medication used in the treatment of short-term and long-term insomnia. It is one of the few FDA-approved hypnotic medications with a controlled substance designation that does not have restrictions on its length of use. Evidence supports benefits up to six months, with some studies suggesting similar efficacy after 12 months. It is taken by mouth.
Eszopiclone's primary mechanism of action involves enhancing the natural effect of GABA receptors by acting as a positive allosteric modulator on GABA-A expressing neurons. This increases the frequency of the chloride channel opening when GABA is present. This is a distinguishing feature, as eszopiclone will not force sleep or act as a tranquilizer but instead encourages a positive sleep-wake routine.
Common side effects include headache, dry mouth, nausea, and dizziness. Severe side effects may include suicidal thoughts, hallucinations, and angioedema. Rapid decreasing of the dose may result in withdrawal. Eszopiclone is classified as a nonbenzodiazepine or Z-drug and a sedative and hypnotic of the cyclopyrrolone group. It is the S-stereoisomer of zopiclone.
Approved for medical use in the United States in 2004, eszopiclone is available as a generic medication. In 2020, it was the 232nd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1 million prescriptions. Eszopiclone is not sold in the European Union; as of 2009, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) ruled that it was too similar to zopiclone to be considered a new active substance.

## Medical uses

A 2018 Cochrane review found that it produced moderate improvement in sleep onset and maintenance. The authors suggest that where preferred non-pharmacological treatment strategies have been exhausted, eszopiclone provides an efficient treatment for insomnia. In 2014, the US Food and Drug Administration asked that the starting dose be lowered from 2 milligrams to 1 milligram after it was observed in a study that even eight hours after taking the drug at night, some people were not able to cope with their next-day activities like driving and other activities that require full alertness.
Eszopiclone is slightly effective in the treatment of insomnia where difficulty in falling asleep is the primary complaint. The benefit over placebo was found to be of questionable clinical significance. Although the drug effect and the placebo response were rather small and of questionable clinical importance, the two together produce a reasonably large clinical response.

### Elderly

Sedative hypnotic drugs including eszopiclone are more commonly prescribed to the elderly than to younger patients despite benefits of medication being generally unimpressive.
In 2015, the American Geriatrics Society reviewed the safety information about eszopiclone and similar drugs and concluded that the "nonbenzodiazepine, benzodiazepine receptor agonist hypnotics (eszopiclone, zaleplon, zolpidem) are to be avoided without consideration of duration of use because of their association with harms balanced with their minimal efficacy in treating insomnia."
The review made this determination both because of the relatively large dangers to elderly individuals from zolpidem and other "z-drugs" together with the fact the drugs have "minimal efficacy in treating insomnia." This was a change from the 2012 AGS recommendation, which suggested limiting use to 90 days or less. The review stated: "the 90‐day‐use caveat [was] removed from nonbenzodiazepine, benzodiazepine receptor agonist hypnotics, resulting in an unambiguous 'avoid' statement (without caveats) because of the increase in the evidence of harm in this area since the 2012 update."
An extensive review of the medical literature regarding the management of insomnia and the elderly found that there is considerable evidence of the effectiveness and durability of non-drug treatments for insomnia in adults of all ages and that these interventions are underutilized. Compared with the benzodiazepines, the nonbenzodiazepine sedative-hypnotics, including eszopiclone appeared to offer few, if any, significant clinical advantages in efficacy or tolerability in elderly persons. It was found that newer agents with novel mechanisms of action and improved safety profiles, such as the melatonin receptor agonists, hold promise for the management of chronic insomnia in elderly people. Long-term use of sedative-hypnotics for insomnia lacks an evidence base and has traditionally been discouraged for reasons that include concerns about such potential adverse drug effects as cognitive impairment (anterograde amnesia), daytime sedation, motor incoordination, and increased risk of motor vehicle accidents and falls. In addition, the effectiveness and safety of long-term use of these agents remain to be determined. It was concluded that more research is needed to evaluate the long-term effects of treatment and the most appropriate management strategy for elderly persons with chronic insomnia.
A 2009 meta-analysis found a higher rate of infections.

## Adverse effects

Sleeping pills, including eszopiclone, have been associated with an increased risk of death.
Hypersensitivity to eszopiclone is a contraindication to its use. The presence of liver impairment, lactation and activities requiring mental alertness (e.g., driving) may be considered when determining frequency and dosage.

A 2009 meta-analysis found a 44% higher rate of mild infections, such as pharyngitis or sinusitis, in people taking eszopiclone or other hypnotic drugs compared to those taking a placebo.

### Dependence

In the United States, eszopiclone is a schedule IV controlled substance under the Controlled Substances Act. Use of eszopiclone may lead to physical and psychological dependence. The risk of non-medical use and dependence increases with the dose and duration of usage and concomitant use of other psychoactive substances. The risk is also greater in patients with a history of alcohol use disorder or other substance use disorder or history of psychiatric disorders. Tolerance may develop after repeated use of benzodiazepines and benzodiazepine-like drugs for a few weeks.
A study funded and carried out by Sepracor, the manufacturer of eszopiclone, found no signs of tolerance or dependence in a group of patients followed for up to six months.

### Non-medical use

A study of non-medical use potential of eszopiclone found that in persons with a known history of non-medical benzodiazepine use, eszopiclone at doses of 6 and 12 mg produced effects similar to those of diazepam 20 mg. The study found that at these doses which are two or more times greater than the maximum recommended doses, a dose-related increase in reports of amnesia, sedation, sleepiness, and hallucinations was observed for both eszopiclone (Lunesta) as well as for diazepam (Valium).

### Overdose

Overdoses of eszopiclone up to 90 times the recommended dose have been reported in which the patient fully recovered. Fatalities have been reported only in cases in which eszopiclone was combined with other drugs or alcohol. Overdose may be successfully treated with flumazenil, a GABAA receptor antagonist used also for benzodiazepine overdose.
Poison control centers reported that between 2005 and 2006 there were 525 total eszopiclone overdoses recorded in the state of Texas, the majority of which were intentional suicide attempts.
If consumed within the last hour, eszopiclone overdose can be treated with the administration of activated charcoal or via gastric lavage.

## Interactions

There is an increased risk of central nervous system depression when eszopiclone is taken together with other CNS depressant agents, including antipsychotics, sedative hypnotics (like barbiturates or benzodiazepines), antihistamines, opioids, phenothiazines, and some antidepressants. There is also increased risk of central nervous system depression with other medications that inhibit the metabolic activities of the CYP3A4 enzyme system of the liver. Substances that inhibit this enzyme system include nelfinavir, ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin and grapefruit juice. Alcohol also has an additive effect when used concurrently with eszopiclone. Eszopiclone is most effective if it is not taken after a heavy meal with high fat content.

## Pharmacology

Eszopiclone acts on benzodiazepine binding site situated on GABAA neurons as a positive allosteric modulator. This action leads to an increased frequency of chloride channels opening when GABA is naturally present. The increased flow of negatively charged chloride ions into the postsynaptic GABA neuron then causes hyperpolarization, reducing brain excitability and helping to sustain healthy sleep patterns.
Eszopiclone is rapidly absorbed after oral administration, with serum levels peaking between .45 and 1.3 hours. The elimination half-life of eszopiclone is approximately 6 hours and it is extensively metabolized by oxidation and demethylation. Approximately 52% to 59% of a dose is weakly bound to plasma protein. Cytochrome P450 (CYP) isozymes CYP3A4 and CYP2E1 are involved in the biotransformation of eszopiclone; thus, drugs that induce or inhibit these CYP isozymes may affect the metabolism of eszopiclone. Less than 10% of the orally administered dose is excreted in the urine as racemic zopiclone. In terms of benzodiazepine receptor binding and relevant potency, 3 mg of eszopiclone is equivalent to 10 mg of diazepam.

## History

In a controversial 2009 article in the New England Journal of Medicine, "Lost in Transmission — FDA Drug Information That Never Reaches Clinicians", it was reported that the largest of three Lunesta trials found that compared to placebo Lunesta "was superior to placebo" while it only shortened initial time falling asleep by 15 minutes on average. "Clinicians who are interested in the drug's efficacy cannot find efficacy information in the label: it states only that Lunesta is superior to placebo. The FDA's medical review provides efficacy data, albeit not until page 306 of the 403-page document. In the longest, largest phase 3 trial, patients in the Lunesta group reported falling asleep an average of 15 minutes faster and sleeping an average of 37 minutes longer than those in the placebo group. However, on average, Lunesta patients still met criteria for insomnia and reported no clinically meaningful improvement in next-day alertness or functioning."

### Availability in Europe

On September 11, 2007, Sepracor signed a marketing deal with British pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline for the rights to sell eszopiclone (under the name Lunivia rather than Lunesta) in Europe. Sepracor was expected to receive approximately \$155 million if the deal went through. In 2008 Sepracor submitted an application to the EMA (the European Union's equivalent to the U.S. FDA) for authorization to market the drug in the EU, and initially received a favorable response. However, Sepracor withdrew its authorization application in 2009 after the EMA stated it would not be granting eszopiclone 'new active substance' status, as it was essentially pharmacologically and therapeutically too similar to zopiclone to be considered a new patentable product. Since the patent on zopiclone has expired, this ruling would have allowed rival companies to also legally produce cheaper generic versions of eszopiclone for the European market. As of November 2012, Sepracor has not resubmitted its authorization application and eszopiclone is not available in Europe. The deal with GSK fell through, and GSK instead launched a \$3.3 billion deal to market Actelion's almorexant sleeping tablet, which entered phase 3 medical trials before development was abandoned due to side effects.
Since 2020 eszopiclone is available under the brand name Esogno in various European countries marketed by GL Pharma.
