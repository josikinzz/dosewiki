## Overview

### Description

This compound belongs to the class of organic compounds known as benzothiadiazoles. These are heterocyclic aromatic compounds containing a benzene ring fused to a thiadiazole ring. Thiadiazole is a five-membered aromatic heterocycle made up of one sulfur atom and two nitrogen atoms.

### Background

Tizanidine is a fast-acting drug used for the management of muscle spasm, which may result from the effects of multiple sclerosis, stroke, an acquired brain injury, or a spinal cord injury
9
.  It may also be caused by musculoskeletal injury
5
.  Regardless of the cause, muscle spasticity can be an extremely painful and debilitating condition.
Initially approved by the FDA in 1996, tizanidine is an Alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist reducing spasticity by the presynaptic inhibition of excitatory neurotransmitters that cause firing of neurons promoting muscle spasm
Label
.

### Indication

Tizanidine is indicated for the relief of muscle spasticity, which can interfere with daily activities.  The general recommendation is to reserve tizanidine use for periods of time when there is a particular need for relief, as it has a short duration of action
Label
,
11
.

### Pharmacodynamics

A note on spasticity
Spasticity is an increase in muscle accompanied by uncontrolled, repetitive contractions of skeletal muscles which are involuntary.
The patient suffering from muscle spasticity may have reduced mobility and high levels of pain, contributing to poor quality of life and problems performing activities of personal hygiene and care
7
.
General effects
Tizanidine is a rapidly acting drug used for the relief of muscle spasticity when it is required for performing specific activities. It acts as an agonist at Alpha-2 adrenergic receptor sites and relieves symptoms of muscle spasticity, allowing the continuation of normal daily activities. In animal models, tizanidine has not been shown to exert direct effects on skeletal muscle fibers or the neuromuscular junction, and has shown no significant effect on monosynaptic spinal reflexes (consisting of the communication between only 1 sensory neuron and 1 motor neuron)
10
. The frequency of muscle spasm and clonus are shown to be decreased by tizanidine
9
. Tizanidine shows a stronger action on polysynaptic reflexes, which involve several interneurons (relay neurons) communicating with motor neurons stimulating muscle movement
10
.
Effects on blood pressure and heart rate
This drug decreases heart rate and blood pressure in humans
4
,
6
.  Despite this, rebound hypertension and tachycardia along with increased spasticity can occur when tizanidine is abruptly discontinued
8
.

### Mechanism of Action

Alpha-1 adrenergic receptors
Agonist
Alpha-2 adrenergic receptors
Agonist

### Absorption

This drug undergoes significant first-pass metabolism. After the administration of an oral dose, tizanidine is mostly absorbed. The absolute oral bioavailability of tizanidine is measured to be about 40%
Label
.
Effect of food on absorption
Food has been shown to increase absorption for both the tablets and capsules. The increase in absorption with the tablet (about 30%) was noticeably higher than the capsule (~10%). When the capsule and tablet were administered with food, the amount absorbed from the capsule was about 80% of the amount absorbed from the tablet
Label
. It is therefore advisable to take this drug with food for increased absorption, especially in tablet form.

### Metabolism

About 95% of the ingested dose of tizanidine is metabolized. The main enzyme involved in the hepatic metabolism of tizanidine is CYP1A2

### Half-life

Approximately 2.5 hours

.

### Toxicity

LD50 information
Oral LD50 (rat): 414 mg/kg; Subcutaneous LD50 (rat): 282 mg/kg; Oral LD50 (mouse): 235 mg/kg
MSDS
Use in pregnancy
Animal studies have determined that this drug causes fetal harm
Label
. Studies have not been performed in humans, and it is advisable to ensure that tizanidine use in pregnant women should be reserved for cases in which possible benefit clearly outweighs the possible risk to mother and unborn child
11
.
Use in breastfeeding
In studies of rat models, this tizanidine was found excreted in the breastmilk with a milk-to-blood ratio of 1.8:1
Label
. In young nursing rats, abnormal results were obtained in tests indicative of central nervous system function. Various developmental changes that may have been attributable to the drug were observed.  It is unknown whether tizanidine is excreted in human milk. It is a lipid-soluble drug, however, and likely to be excreted into breast milk
11
.
Carcinogenesis and mutagenesis
No signs of carcinogenicity were observed in two dietary studies performed in rodent models. Tizanidine was given to mice for 78 weeks at doses reaching a maximum 16 mg/kg (equivalent to twice the maximum recommended human dose). In addition, the drug was given to rats for 104 weeks at doses reaching 9 mg/kg (equivalent to 2.5 times the maximum recommended human dose). There was a lack of a statistically significant increase in the occurrence of tumors in either study group
11
.
Tizanidine was not found to be mutagenic or clastogenic in several laboratory essays, including the bacterial Ames test, the mammalian gene mutation test, in addition to the chromosomal aberration test in Chinese hamster cells and several other assays
11
.

### Mechanism of action

Tizanidine reduces spasticity by causing presynaptic inhibition of motor neurons via agonist actions at Alpha-2 adrenergic receptor sites.
This drug is centrally acting and leads to a reduction in the release of excitatory amino acids like glutamate and aspartate, which cause neuronal firing that leads to muscle spasm. The above reduction and excitatory neurotransmitter release results in presynaptic inhibition of motor neurons. The strongest effect of tizanidine has been shown to occur on spinal polysynaptic pathways.   The anti-nociceptive and anticonvulsant activities of tizanidine may also be attributed to agonist action on Alpha-2 receptors.  Tizanidine also binds with weaker affinity to the Alpha-1 receptors, explaining its slight and temporary effect on the cardiovascular system

Label
.

### Clearance

A note on renal impairment
Tizanidine clearance is found to be decreased by more than 50% in elderly patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min) 
compared to healthy elderly subjects; this would be expected to lead to a longer duration of clinical effect. This drug should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment

### General Function

A cytochrome P450 monooxygenase involved in the metabolism of various endogenous substrates, including fatty acids, steroid hormones and vitamins (PubMed:10681376, PubMed:11555828, PubMed:12865317, PubMed:19965576, PubMed:9435160). Mechanistically, uses molecular oxygen inserting one oxygen atom into a substrate, and reducing the second into a water molecule, with two electrons provided by NADPH via cytochrome P450 reductase (NADPH--hemoprotein reductase) (PubMed:10681376, PubMed:11555828, PubMed:12865317, PubMed:19965576, PubMed:9435160). Catalyzes the hydroxylation of carbon-hydrogen bonds (PubMed:11555828, PubMed:12865317). Exhibits high catalytic activity for the formation of hydroxyestrogens from estrone (E1) and 17beta-estradiol (E2), namely 2-hydroxy E1 and E2 (PubMed:11555828, PubMed:12865317). Metabolizes cholesterol toward 25-hydroxycholesterol, a physiological regulator of cellular cholesterol homeostasis (PubMed:21576599). May act as a major enzyme for all-trans retinoic acid biosynthesis in the liver. Catalyzes two successive oxidative transformation of all-trans retinol to all-trans retinal and then to the active form all-trans retinoic acid (PubMed:10681376). Primarily catalyzes stereoselective epoxidation of the last double bond of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), displaying a strong preference for the (R,S) stereoisomer (PubMed:19965576). Catalyzes bisallylic hydroxylation and omega-1 hydroxylation of PUFA (PubMed:9435160). May also participate in eicosanoids metabolism by converting hydroperoxide species into oxo metabolites (lipoxygenase-like reaction, NADPH-independent) (PubMed:21068195). Plays a role in the oxidative metabolism of xenobiotics. Catalyzes the N-hydroxylation of heterocyclic amines and the O-deethylation of phenacetin (PubMed:14725854). Metabolizes caffeine via N3-demethylation (Probable)

## Dosage & Duration

### Oral

**Dosage:**
- Threshold: 25 μg
- Light: 2 - 3 mg
- Common: 4 - 5 mg
- Strong: 6 - 8 mg
- Heavy: 8 mg +

**Duration:**
- Total: 2 - 6 hours
- Onset: 15 - 45 minutes
- Peak: 60 - 120 minutes
**Tizanidine can induce dangerously low blood pressures when used in excessive doses**
 
Care should be taken when taking high doses of tizanidine, **even with an established tolerance** . Users taking hallucinogenic doses should have a hypertensive agent available or a supervisor present. Exercise extreme caution when attempting hallucinogenic doses.
**Tizanidine** (known by the trade names **Zanaflex** and **Trinex** among others) is a [depressant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressant) substance of the imidazoline class closely related to [clonidine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Clonidine) . Tizanidine is primarily used primarily as an antispasmodic drug. Tizanidine's effectivness is similar to that of [baclofen](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Baclofen) or [diazepam](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Diazepam) .

Tizanidine is a central α 2 adrenergic agonist. The relationship between the α 2 receptor agonism and the spasmolytic function of tizanidine is not fully understood .

While recreational use is extremely rare, some users take tizanidine for its standalone sedative effects or to potentiate the effects of [opiates](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opiates)    . In higher doses, tizanidine is capable of inducing [hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hallucinations) , [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) , and [delirium](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delirium)   .

## Chemistry

Tizanidine is 2,1,3-Benzothiadiazole substituted at C-4 by a Delta(1)-imidazolin-2-ylamino group and at C-4 by a chloro group. It is an agonist at α 2 -adrenergic receptor sites. It is a benzothiadiazole and a member of imidazoles .

## Pharmacology

Tizanidine is an [imidazoline](/w/index.php?title=Imidazoline&action=edit&redlink=1) derivative and centrally acting α 2 [adrenergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Adrenergic) [agonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist) closely related to Clonidine. Tizanidine inhibits the release of excitatory amino acids from spinal interneurons. As a result, Tizanidine enhances the presynaptic inhibition of motor neurons .

Tizanidine also has some affinity for the α 1 receptors, but to a lesser than Clonidine, which may explain why its cardiovascular effects are so much milder than that of Clonidine . Tizanidine has approximately one tenth to one fifteenth of the blood pressure lowering effect of clonidine .

Tizanidine has also been found to have [anticonvulsant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anticonvulsant) effects against strychnine-induced seizures but not against [GABA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GABA) -induced seizures. The α 2 receptor mediated inhibition of inter-neuronal activity appears to be the cause of Tizanidine's anti-convulsant properties .

Tizanidine has an oral bioavailability of 20-34% and an elimination half-life of 2.5 hours. It attains steady-state concentration within 24-48 hours after administration

The table below compares the selectivity of Tizanidine and other drugs to the imidzaoline-receptor and the α 2 receptors in rats. Tizanidine has a significantly greater selectivity to the imidazoline receptor than clonidine. The imidazoline receptor selectivity of tizanidine may be responsible for its unique pharmacological profile .

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Seizure suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizure_suppression)** - Tizanidine has been found to suppress strycnine induced seizures, but not GABA induced seizures.
- **[Sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation)** - Tizanidine can produce a strong sedative effect. Users can become very tired and sleep through stimuli that would otherwise wake them.
- **[Pain relief](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pain_relief)**
- **[Muscle relaxation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_relaxation)**
- **[Physical euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria)** - This effect is very mild and may not be pronounced at all in some users.
- **[Spontaneous bodily sensations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_bodily_sensations)** - It only occurs at higher doses as a result of low blood pressure and mostly at lips.
- **[Perception of bodily heaviness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perception_of_bodily_heaviness)**
- **[Decreased blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Decreased_blood_pressure)**
- **[Decreased heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Decreased_heart_rate)**
- **[Abnormal heartbeat](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Abnormal_heartbeat)**
- **[Dizziness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dizziness)** - Because of the cardiovascular effects of Tizanidine, users can become dizzy or lightheaded.
- **[Headache](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Headache)** - When taking excessive doses, headaches are a common side effect.
- **[Watery eyes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Watery_eyes)**
- **[Physical fatigue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_fatigue)**
- **[Pupil constriction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pupil_constriction)**
- **[Dry mouth](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dry_mouth)** ### Visual effects
 
- - **[Acuity suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Acuity_suppression)** - This effect typically presents itself at higher doses.
 
#### Distortions
 
- **[Environmental patterning](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Environmental_patterning)**
- **[Visual haze](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_haze)**
- **[Drifting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting)**
 
#### Geometry
 
At high doses, geometry can be observed likely due to experiencing low blood pressure and circulation to the brain. The geometry is distinct from psychedelic and dissociative drugs. It can be described as intricate in complexity, abstract in form, synthetic in feel, unstructured in organization, dimly lit, multicolored in scheme, flat in shading, soft in edges, smooth in motion, slow in speed, small in size, angular in corners, non-immersive in depth, and consistent in intensity.
 
The geometry of Tizanidine never exceeds level 4. The doses required to observe such geometries can induce dangerously low blood pressures and cause one to lose consciousness . Users should exercise caution when taking hallucinogenic doses, as the threshold for hallucinations is not far from the threshold for psychosis in many users .
 
#### Hallucinatory states
 
In higher doses, Tizanidine is capable of inducing a delirious state.
 
- **[Scenarios and plots](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenarios_and_plots)** ### Cognitive effects
 
- - **[Cognitive fatigue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_fatigue)**
- **[Dream potentiation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dream_potentiation)** - Some users of tizanidine notice strange or increasingly vivid dreams after continuous use of tizanidine.
- **[Focus suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Focus_suppression)**
- **[Anxiety suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety_suppression)**
- **[Memory suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Memory_suppression)** - This effect occurs at higher doses
- **[Thought deceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_deceleration)**
- **[Delirium](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delirium)** - At extremely high doses, delirium can be induced.
- **[Sleepiness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sleepiness)** - This is the most prevalent cognitive effect of Tizanidine ### After effects
 
- - **[Increased heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate)** - This occurs as a rebound effect to tizanidine's cardiovascular effects and typically presents itself after prolonged use.
- **[Increased blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure)** - This occurs as a rebound effect to tizanidine's cardiovascular effects and typically presents itself after prolonged use.
- **[Irritability](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Irritability)**
- **[Soreness](/w/index.php?title=Soreness&action=edit&redlink=1)** - After the effects of tizanidine wear off, muscles that weren't sore before using the drug can become sore with more ease. For most users, this first presents itself as an increased soreness in the neck.
### Experience reports

There are currently 0 experience reports which describe the effects of this substance in our [experience index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Experience_index) .

Additional experience reports can be found here:

## Toxicity and harm potential

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_use) when using this substance.

While no long term studies of tizanidine use in humans have been done, studies done in animals indicate no signs of long term carcinogenicity. However, tizanidine has been shown to have a developmental effect on young rats .

Some long term tizanidine use has been attributed to liver problems and in extreme cases, liver failure and death .

### Lethal dosage

The [LD50](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LD50) of oral tizanidine in rats was found to be 414mg/kg in rats and 235 mg/kg in mice .

In some cases, Tizanidine overdose can be reversed with naloxone; however, this is not the case with everyone .

### Tolerance and addiction potential

While dependence is rare, use of Tizanidine exceeding 36mg daily over an extended period of time can lead to hypertensive withdrawals. In cases where dependence has been built, a user should taper to avoid a hypertensive crisis .

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **Depressants** ( *[1,4-Butanediol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/1,4-Butanediol) , [2M2B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2M2B) , [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) , [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) , [barbiturates](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Barbiturates) , [GHB](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GHB) / [GBL](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GBL) , [methaqualone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methaqualone) , [opioids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioids)* ) - This combination potentiates the [muscle relaxation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_relaxation) , [amnesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amnesia) , [sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation) , and [respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression) caused by one another. At higher doses, it can lead to a sudden, unexpected loss of consciousness along with a dangerous amount of depressed respiration. There is also an increased risk of suffocating on one's vomit while unconscious. If [nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea) or vomiting occurs before a loss of consciousness, users should attempt to fall asleep in the [recovery position](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Recovery_position) or have a friend move them into it.
- **Dissociatives** - This combination can unpredictably potentiate the [amnesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amnesia) , [sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation) , [motor control loss](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motor_control_loss) and [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) that can be caused by each other. It may also result in a sudden loss of consciousness accompanied by a dangerous degree of [respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression) . If [nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea) or vomiting occurs before consciousness is lost, users should attempt to fall asleep in the [recovery position](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Recovery_position) or have a friend move them into it.
- **Stimulants** - Stimulants mask the [sedative](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation) effect of depressants, which is the main factor most people use to gauge their level of intoxication. Once the stimulant effects wear off, the effects of the depressant will significantly increase, leading to intensified [disinhibition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Disinhibition) , [motor control loss](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motor_control_loss) , and dangerous [black-out states](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amnesia) . This combination can also potentially result in severe dehydration if one's fluid intake is not closely monitored. If choosing to combine these substances, one should strictly limit themselves to a pre-set schedule of dosing only a certain amount per hour until a maximum threshold has been reached.

Tizanidine, sold under the brand name Zanaflex among others, is an alpha-2 (α2) adrenergic receptor agonist, similar to clonidine, that is used to treat muscle spasticity due to spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis, and spastic cerebral palsy. Effectiveness appears similar to baclofen or diazepam. It is taken by mouth.
Common side effects of tizanidine include dry mouth, sleepiness, weakness, and dizziness. Serious side effects may include low blood pressure, liver problems, psychosis, and QT prolongation. It is unclear if use in pregnancy and breastfeeding is safe. It is an α2-adrenergic agonist, but how it works is not entirely clear.
Tizanidine was approved for medical use in the United States in 1996. It is available as a generic medication. In 2023, it was the 81st most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 8 million prescriptions.

## Medical uses

Tizanidine has been found to be as effective as other antispasmodic drugs and is more tolerable than baclofen and diazepam.

## Side effects

Side effects include dizziness, drowsiness, weakness, nervousness, confusion, hallucinations, strange dreams, depression, vomiting, dry mouth, constipation, diarrhea, stomach pain, heartburn, increased muscle spasms, back pain, rash, sweating, and a tingling sensation in the arms, legs, hands, and feet.
Symptoms of overdose in 45 cases reported to a poison control center included: lethargy, bradycardia, hypotension, agitation, confusion, vomiting and coma.

## Interactions

Concomitant use of tizanidine and moderate or potent CYP1A2 inhibitors (such as zileuton, certain antiarrhythmics (amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone, verapamil), cimetidine, famotidine, aciclovir, ticlopidine and oral contraceptives) is contraindicated. Concomitant use of tizanidine with fluvoxamine, a potent CYP1A2 inhibitor in humans, resulted in a 33-fold increase in the tizanidine AUC (plasma drug concentration-time curve). For this reason both fluvoxamine and tizanidine should not be taken at the same time. Fluoroquinolone antibiotics such as moxifloxacin, levofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin should also be avoided due to an increased serum concentration of tizanidine when administered concomitantly. Tizanidine has the potential to interact with other central nervous system depressants. Alcohol should be avoided, particularly as it can upset the stomach. The CNS-depressant effects of tizanidine and alcohol are additive. Caution with the following interactions:

antibiotics such as enoxacin, gatifloxacin, levofloxacin, lomefloxacin, moxifloxacin, ofloxacin, sparfloxacin, trovafloxacin, or norfloxacin;
blood pressure medications such as clonidine, guanabenz, guanfacine (Tenex), or methyldopa;
heart rhythm medications such as amiodarone (Cordarone, Pacerone), mexiletine (Mexitil), propafenone (Rhythmol), and verapamil (Calan, Covera, Isoptin).

## Pharmacology

Tizanidine is an α2 receptor agonist closely related to clonidine. It has approximately one-tenth to one-fifteenth of the blood pressure-lowering effect of clonidine. The relation between the α2 receptor agonism and the spasmolytic action is still not fully understood.

### Route of administration

Tizanidine is available as a tablet or capsule. Capsules may be opened and sprinkled on food. However, this may change the absorption of the medication compared to taking the capsule whole. It has a volume of distribution of 2.4 L/kg following intravenous administration.

## Chemistry

Tizanidine is a derivative of 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole and its first published synthesis was reported in a patent. The 5-chloro-2,1,3-benzothiadiazol-4-amine intermediate was a known compound, produced in three steps from 4-chlorophenylenediamine as shown. Treatment with two equivalents of thionyl chloride in pyridine formed the heterocycle, which was nitrated with sodium nitrate in sulfuric acid and reduced using iron and acetic acid.

The amine intermediate was treated with benzoyl chloride and ammonium thiocyanate followed by alkaline hydrolysis to form a thiourea. This was activated as its isothiuronium salt before being treated with ethylene diamine to give tizanidine.
