## Subjective Experience

Released at the end of 2015, 4F-EPH was legally available during the same period as
4F-MPH, and for me, it was that chemical’s ugly little sister.

Why do I state this?

I do so because, whilst having significant similarities in terms of effect, I found it to
provide a less smooth experience, which sometimes had a distinct jittery feel.

I tested it both orally and via insufflation, but both routes led me to reach the same
conclusion.

Whilst accepting that this seemed to have many fans who did consider it to be a
recreational drug, I largely found it to be functional.

As this is active at relatively low doses, particular caution is advised with respect to
this. Note also that as EPH is cited as being caustic to the nasal septum, insufflation
is probably best avoided.
