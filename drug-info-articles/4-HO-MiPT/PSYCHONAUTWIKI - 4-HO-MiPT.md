**4-Hydroxy-N-methyl-N-isopropyltryptamine** (also known as **4-HO-MiPT** , and **Miprocin** ) is a novel [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) substance of the [tryptamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tryptamine) class that produces [psilocybin-like](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocybin) psychedelic effects when [administered](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Routes_of_administration) . It is part of a series of psychedelic [substituted tryptamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tryptamines) such as [4-AcO-DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-AcO-DMT) , [4-HO-MET](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-HO-MET) , [4-HO-DiPT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-HO-DiPT) that are considered to produce variations of the core psychedelic effects typified by [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) .

This substance is relatively uncommon and has only a short history of human use. [Alexander Shulgin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alexander_Shulgin) evaluated its activity in humans in 1979, describing a trial of 12mg as a richly insightful and highly erotic experience. A description of 4-HO-MiPT is included in Shulgin's 1997 book [TiHKAL](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/TiHKAL) . Shulgin's trials and other anecdotal reports suggest that 4-HO-MiPT is similar in activity to [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) , the active component in [psilocybin mushrooms](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocybin_mushrooms) .

Very little data exists about the pharmacological properties, metabolism, and toxicity of 4-HO-MiPT in humans. As with [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) , there have been no reported deaths from 4-HO-MiPT use despite the existence of reports of people taking doses which far exceeds the active dose. This suggests that it is well-tolerated physiologically. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

Today, 4-HO-MiPT is either used [recreationally](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Recreational_drug_use) or as an [entheogenic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entheogenic) substance and is typically distributed as a grey-area [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) by online vendors.

## History and culture

The first synthesis of 4-HO-MiPT was published in 1981 by a team of chemists led by David Repke. Repke and Shulgin later collaborated on a paper evaluating the effects of different oxygen substituents on the MiPT structure, describing 4-HO-MiPT as the most interesting of the series and the only one to possess classical hallucinogen effects.

## Chemistry

4-HO-MiPT or 4-hydroxy-N-methyl-N-isopropyltryptamine is a synthetic indole alkaloid molecule of the [tryptamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tryptamine) class. Tryptamines share a core structure comprised of a bicylic indole heterocycle attached at R 3 to an amino group via an ethyl side chain. 4-HO-MiPT is substituted at R 4 of its indole heterocycle with a hydroxyl (HO) functional group OH-. It also contains a methyl group and an isopropyl chain bound to the terminal amine R N of its tryptamine backbone (MiPT). 4-HO-MiPT is the N-substituted isopropyl homologue of [4-HO-DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-HO-DMT) ( *Psilocin* ).

## Pharmacology

4-HO-MiPT's [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) effects are believed to come from its efficacy at the [5-HT2A receptor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin#The_5-HT_system) as a [partial agonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist#Agonists) . However, the role of these interactions and how they result in the [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) experience continues to remain elusive. 4-HO-MiPT is thought to be a serotonergic psychedelic. Like other serotonergic psychedelics, its method of action is believed to result from its partial agonism of 5-HT 2A and 5-HT 1A serotonin receptors.

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation)** & **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)** - 4-HO-MiPT is considered have the paradoxical property of both being relaxing, stoning and mildly sedating with a marked sense of [physical stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation) that distinguishes it from related substances like [psilocybin mushrooms](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocybin_mushrooms) or [4-AcO-DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-AcO-DMT) .
- **[Spontaneous physical sensations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_physical_sensations)** - The "body high" of 4-HO-MiPT can be described as a pleasurable, warm, soft, and all-encompassing tingling sensation. This maintains a consistent presence that steadily rises following the onset and hits its limit once the peak has been reached.
- **[Changes in felt bodily form](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Changes_in_felt_bodily_form)** - This effect is often accompanied by a sense of warmth or [psychophysical unity](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Unity_and_interconnectedness#Unity_between_the_self_and_specific_external_systems) and usually occurs around or directly after the peak of the experience. Users can feel as if they are physically part of or conjoined with other objects in a seamless continuity. This is usually reported as feeling comfortable, tranquil and mindful, though it can also manifest in the form of bodily tension.
- **[Changes in felt gravity](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Changes_in_felt_gravity)**
- **[Pain relief](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pain_relief)** - This effect is distinct from pain relief produced by opioids. It appears to manifest itself as a result of changes in how the user perceives their body, rather than direct suppression of pain.
- **[Nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea)** - This effect can be greatly lessened or even completely avoided if the individual has an empty stomach prior to ingestion. It is sometimes recommended that one either refrain from eating for approximately 6 to 8 hours before-hand, or to eat a light meal 3 to 4 hours before if the user is feeling physically fatigued and undernourished. The nausea produced by 4-HO-MiPT is generally considered to be much less prominent than it is with [psilocybin mushrooms](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocybin#Psilocybin-containing_mushrooms) , perhaps owing to the fact that there is no fungal-matter the body has to digest when the isolated synthetic form is consumed.
- **[Temperature regulation suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Temperature_regulation_suppression)** - 4-HO-MiPT can cause fluctuates in the user's internal sense of temperature, which can manifest as sudden bouts of uncomfortable coldness or warmth, which is why a climate-controllable environment is strongly recommended in terms of a proper setting for a trip.
- **[Muscle contractions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_contractions)** - The muscle contractions that can occasionally be produced by 4-HO-MiPT tend to be transient and benign feeling in nature, compared to many other [tryptamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tryptamines) , [phenethylamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamines) and [lysergamides](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Lysergamides) .
- **[Olfactory hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Olfactory_hallucination)**
- **[Frequent urination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Frequent_urination)**
- **[Pupil dilation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pupil_dilation)**
- **[Increased salivation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_salivation)**
- **[Excessive yawning](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Excessive_yawning)** - This effect seems to be uniquely pronounced among psilocin and related tryptamines. It can occur to a lesser degree on [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) and very rarely on psychedelic [phenethylamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamines) like [mescaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mescaline) . It typically occurs in conjunction with [watery eyes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Watery_eyes) .
- **[Watery eyes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Watery_eyes)**
- **[Teeth grinding](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Teeth_grinding)** - This component is considerably less intense when compared with that of substances like [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) when it does happen to occur, but happens more readily than with related substances like [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) or [psilocybin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocybin) , perhaps owing to the greater degree of stimulation it produces.
- **[Seizure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizure)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] - This is likely a rare effect but may occur for those who are predisposed to them, especially while in physically taxing conditions such as being dehydrated, fatigued, undernourished, or overheated. However it should be noted that there are no documented cases of seizures occurring with this compound. ### Visual effects

#### Geometry
 
The visual geometry that may be experienced can be described as more similar in appearance to that of [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) , [ayahuasca](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ayahuasca) and [2C-E](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-E) than [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) or [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) . It can be comprehensively described through its [variations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Geometry#Variations) as intricate in complexity, abstract in form, organic in style, structured in organization, brightly lit and multicoloured in scheme, glossy in shading, soft in edges, large in size, slow in speed, smooth in motion, rounded in corners, non-immersive in depth and consistent in intensity. The visuals have a very "natural" feel to them and at higher dosages are significantly more likely to result in states of [level 8B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/8B_Geometry) visual geometry over [level 8A](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/8A_Geometry) .
 
#### Hallucinatory states
 
4-HO-MiPT and its various other forms produce a full range of high level hallucinatory states in a fashion that is more consistent and reproducible than that of many other commonly used [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) . These effects generally include:
 
- **[Machinescapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Machinescapes)**
- **[Transformations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Transformations)**
- **[Internal hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucination)** ( *[autonomous entities](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Autonomous_entities)* ; *[settings, sceneries, and landscapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Settings,_sceneries,_and_landscapes)* ; *[perspective hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perspective_hallucinations)* and *[scenarios and plots](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenarios_and_plots)* ) - This effect is very consistent in dark environments at appropriately high dosages. They can be comprehensively described through their [variations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucinations#Variations) as lucid in believability, interactive in style, new experiences in content, autonomous in controllability, [geometry](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Geometry) -based in style and almost exclusively of a personal, religious, spiritual, science-fiction, fantasy, surreal, nonsensical or transcendental nature in their overall theme.
- **[External hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/External_hallucination)** ( *[autonomous entities](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Autonomous_entities)* ; *[settings, sceneries, and landscapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Settings,_sceneries,_and_landscapes)* ; *[perspective hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perspective_hallucinations)* and *[scenarios and plots](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenarios_and_plots)* ) - These are more common within dark environments and can be comprehensively described through their [variations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/External_hallucinations#Variations) as lucid in believability, interactive in style, new experiences in content, autonomous in controllability, geometry-based in style and almost exclusively of a personal, religious, spiritual, science-fiction, fantasy, surreal, nonsensical or transcendental nature in their overall theme. ### Cognitive effects
 
- The cognitive effects of 4-HO-MiPT are described by many as extremely relaxing, profound and stoning in style when compared to other commonly used [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) such as [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) or [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) which tend to be energetic and stimulating. It contains a large number of typical and unique psychedelic cognitive effects. The most prominent of these typical effects generally include: 
- **[Analysis enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Analysis_enhancement)**
- **[Conceptual thinking](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Conceptual_thinking)**
- **[Autonomous voice communication](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Autonomous_voice_communication)**
- **[Déjà vu](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/D%C3%A9j%C3%A0_vu)**
- **[Emotion enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Emotion_enhancement)**
- **[Enhancement and suppression cycles](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Enhancement_and_suppression_cycles)** - This can be described as constant waves of extremely stimulated and profound thinking which are spontaneously surpassed in a cyclic fashion by waves of general thought suppression and mental intoxication. These two states seem to switch between each other in a consistent loop once every 20 - 60 minutes.
- **[Cognitive euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_euphoria)**
- **[Increased libido](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_libido)**
- **[Immersion enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Immersion_enhancement)**
- **[Novelty enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Novelty_enhancement)**
- **[Creativity enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Creativity_enhancement)**
- **[Feelings of impending doom](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Feelings_of_impending_doom)** 
- **[Catharsis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Catharsis)**
- **[Rejuvenation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Rejuvenation)**
- **[Increased sense of humor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_sense_of_humor)** 
- **[Laughter fits](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Laughter_fits)**
- **[Increased music appreciation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_music_appreciation)**

- **[Time distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Time_distortion)**
- **[Wakefulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness)** ### Auditory effects
 
- - **[Auditory enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_enhancement)**
- **[Auditory distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_distortion)**
- **[Auditory hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_hallucination)** ### Multi-sensory effects
 
- - **[Synaesthesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Synaesthesia)** - In its fullest manifestation, this is a very rare and non-reproducible effect. Increasing the dosage can increase the likelihood of this occurring, but seems to only be a prominent part of the experience among those who are already predisposed to synaesthetic states. ### Transpersonal effects
 
- It should be noted that these effects are reported to occur less reliably and impactfully than with the closely related [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) or [psilocybin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocybin) , and generally require heavier doses to potentially induce. They are listed below as follows: 
- **[Spirituality enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spirituality_enhancement)**
- **[Existential self-realization](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Existential_self-realization)**
- **[Unity and interconnectedness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Unity_and_interconnectedness)**
### Combination effects

- **[Cannabis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cannabis)** - Cannabis majorly amplifies the sensory and cognitive effects of 4-HO-MiPT. This should be used with extreme caution, especially if one is not experienced with psychedelics. This interaction can also amplify the [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [confusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Confusion) and [delusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusion) producing aspects of cannabis significantly. Those who choose to use this combination are advised to start off with only a fraction of their usual cannabis dose, and slow down the pace of their normal intake considerably.
- **[Dissociatives](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociatives)** - Dissociatives can enhance the geometry, euphoria, dissociation and hallucinatory effects of 4-HO-MiPT. Dissociative-induced [holes, spaces, and voids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_disconnection#Holes.2C_spaces_and_voids) while under the influence of 4-HO-MiPT can result in significantly more vivid visuals than dissociatives alone, along with more intense [internal hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucinations) , [confusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Confusion) , [nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea) , [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) and chances of a [psychotic reaction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) .
- **[Benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines)** - Depending on the dosage, benzodiazepines can slightly to completely reduce the intensity of the cognitive, physical and visual effects of a miprocin trip. They can be very efficient at largely stopping or mitigating a [bad trip](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bad_trip) at the cost of amnesia and reduced trip intensity. Caution is advised when acquiring them for this purpose, however, due to the very high addiction potential that benzodiazepines possess.
- **[Psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics)** - When used in combination with other psychedelics, the physical, cognitive and visual effects of each substance intensify and synergize strongly with each other. The synergy between those substances is unpredictable, and for this reason, is generally not advised. If choosing to combine psychedelics, it is recommended to start with lower dosages than one would take for either substance individually.

### Experience reports

There are currently anecdotal reports which describe the effects of this compound within our [experience index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Experience_index) .

## Toxicity and harm potential

The toxicity and long-term health effects of recreational 4-HO-MiPT use do not seem to have been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dose is unknown. This is because 4-HO-MiPT is a [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) with very little history of human usage.

Anecdotal evidence from those have tried 4-HO-MiPT suggests that there are no negative health effects attributed to simply trying the drug by itself at low to moderate doses and using it very sparingly (but nothing can be completely guaranteed). [Independent research](https://www.google.com/) should always be done to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe before consumption.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this substance.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

4-HO-MiPT is not habit-forming, and the desire to use it can actually decrease with use. It is most often self-regulating.

Tolerance to the effects of 4-HO-MiPT is built almost immediately after ingestion. After that, it takes about 3 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 7 days to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). 4-HO-MiPT presents cross-tolerance with all [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) , meaning that after the consumption of 4-HO-MiPT all psychedelics will have a reduced effect.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **[Lithium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_(medication))** - Lithium is commonly prescribed for the treatment of [bipolar disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder) . There is a large body of anecdotal evidence that suggests taking it with [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) significantly increases the risk of [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) and [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) . As a result, this combination is strictly discouraged.
- **[Cannabis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cannabis)** - Cannabis may have an unexpectedly strong and unpredictable synergy with the effects of 4-HO-MiPT. Caution is advised with this combination as it can significantly increase the risk of adverse psychological reactions like [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) , and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) . Users are advised to start off with only a fraction of their normal cannabis dose and take long breaks between hits to avoid unintentional overdose.
- **[Stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants)** - Stimulants like [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) , [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) or [methylphenidate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylphenidate) affect many parts of the brain and alter [dopaminergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) function. This combination can increase the risk of [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) , and [thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops) . This interaction may also result in an elevated risk of [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) . [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol)** - Tramadol is well-documented to lower the seizure threshold and [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) may act to trigger seizures in susceptible individuals.
