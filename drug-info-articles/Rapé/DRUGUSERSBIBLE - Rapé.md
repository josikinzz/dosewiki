## Subjective Experience

Rapé appeared on the UK market just a few months prior to the blanket ban on
psychoactives in 2016. I wrote the following forum post at the time:

```
In recent weeks I have noticed a couple of websites suddenly offering this in
the UK. It is a type of snuff, which the most prominent vendor states is “a
complex blend of pulverized plants, which usually contain a strong tobacco”.
Instead of regular tobacco (nicotiana tabacum) it tends to be based around a
much stronger cousin, nicotiana rustica.
```
```
Rapé is prevalent around the Amazon basin. It is used as a shamanic
medicine, and is occasionally offered during ayahuasca and other sacred
ceremonies.
```
```
Independently, nicotiana rustica also has a very long history of ritual use. Its
effects are rather different to those of the manufactured version of tobacco, as
pimped on the high street. They broadly include a strong stimulation, a head
rush, and greater focus, with a lengthy sedation occurring later.
```

```
The reason I post this now relates to timing. It speculatively occurs to me that
these vending initiatives may be a direct or indirect response to the
forthcoming ban on psychoactives: tobacco will remain legal, and these
substances may therefore remain openly available.
```
```
Whether this is a positive or not, it is important that harm reduction is
considered early in the fray. There is very little information available with
respect to this, but hopefully this post can start the ball rolling.
```
```
I have experimented previously with both nicotiana rustica and a couple of
rapé variants. They can certainly pack a punch, and not necessarily a positive
one.
```
```
In the indigenous environment the snuff is blown into the nostril by a partner,
in a similar manner to that practised for yopo seeds. However, self-
administration tools are also available, in the form of a sort of V-shaped
bamboo tubing, called a kuripe.
```
```
The effect can also be induced via a very strong snort. This is a central matter,
as the intensity of the experience is closely linked to both the amount taken
and the strength of the blow (or inhalation).
```
```
I have remained cautious with this substance partly because tobacco itself is
addictive and harmful. I don’t smoke, and don’t want to. Bearing in mind that
nicotiana rustica is frequently cited as being about 20 times more powerful
than nicotiana tabacum you can probably see my point. It may or may not
present a significantly higher risk of addiction, but I have never felt inclined to
take the chance.
```
```
The other issue that concerns me is the recurrent claim that large doses (of
nicotiana rustica) can cause acute nicotine poisoning and death. This sort of
comment, found on drugs-forum.com, can’t be ignored:
```
```
“I've never heard of anyone doing this outside of various Central/
South American tribal shamans. These people systematically addict
themselves to tobacco and develop tolerances that are staggering, so
that they are able to ingest what would be lethal doses for most
people. And even these shamans have been known to OD and wind up
dead as a sacrifice to their art.” ~ rawbeer
```
```
I’m not trying to put a damp cloth on this, or generally undermine it, but
clearly, caution is advisable.
```
```
Also relevant is that it is usually extremely hard to uncover exactly what is in
most of the rapé variants, including their actual nicotiana rustica content.
Having stated all this, it should be noted that there are versions of rapè that
don’t contain nicotine, although I have not personally encountered them.
```

```
If anyone can add to this starter in any way please do so. Rapé provides a
definite and strong psychoactive effect, and my hunch is that it will become
much more widely used in the short term.
```
Regarding content, the vendor of my particular samples stated that rapé can contain
alkaloid ashes, which can be “made from psychoactive plants” and in some cases
hallucinogens. Given its historical and ritual use this is undoubtedly true, although I
cannot confirm this with respect to my own experiments.

In addition to the recreational aspects I have focused upon above, and as also stated
in the post itself, rapé has long been used for medicinal purposes, usually in a
traditional sacred context. Clearly, the specific plants used in a particular rapé
variant will determine its individual effects. The scope is obviously enormous.

As for my experience, whilst hard hitting, with something of a head shock, rapé was
similar to but nothing like as debilitating as standalone nicotiana rustica. However,
with a strong enough snort/blow perhaps it could be. Further information on
nicotiana rustica itself is provided under the heading of Mapacho, earlier in this
section.

There are clearly certain subtleties with rapé in terms of its different versions and
ingredients, but I suspect that for many these will only manifest themselves with
repeated or prolonged exposure to the tobacco. For the tobacco smoker this may
provide an interesting field of (cautious) research.

ADDENDUM
Some years subsequent to writing the above, and having read a couple of positive
reports, I revisited rapé via another standalone experiment.

I prepared 2 pea sized doses of finely ground yawanawa powder and embarked at
approximately 4:20 pm. In traditional style I blew the first up my left nostril using a
kuripe, and despite gasping with watering eyes managed to repeat with the left.

I was hit immediately. Following on from the severe olfactory discomfort, heat
quickly engulfed my brain/head, top down, and a debilitating and not very pleasant
headspace emerged. The burning sensation drifted into what almost felt like an
illness or flu. I tried to meditate into it and confront it but it was too unpleasant. It
was overwhelming and I stumbled to bed, sweating profusely.

There were mapacho-like aspects to this, which was not surprising, although it was
not quite as intense. Ten minutes passed and I lay there feeling poorly and quite
wretched. After half an hour I was a little better but still unwell. An hour later I was
finally able to rise. I slowly recovered but was not in a good condition for the rest of
the day.

Clearly, such tobacco based materials are not for me, and I certainly won’t be
repeating this.
