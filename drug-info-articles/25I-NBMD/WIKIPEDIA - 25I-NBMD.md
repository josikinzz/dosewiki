25I-NBMD (NBMD-2C-I, Cimbi-29) is a derivative of the phenethylamine hallucinogen 2C-I, discovered in 2006 by a team at Purdue University led by David Nichols. It acts as a potent partial agonist for the 5HT2A receptor with a Ki of 0.049 nM at the human 5HT2A receptor. The corresponding 4-bromo analogue 25B-NBMD has been used for molecular dynamics studies on the shape of the 5-HT2A receptor.
