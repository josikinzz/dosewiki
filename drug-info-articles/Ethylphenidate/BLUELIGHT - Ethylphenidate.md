Ethylphenidate (EPH) is a potent psychostimulant that acts as both a dopamine reuptake inhibitor and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. This compound only has a very brief history of widespread use, and unfortunately no absolute facts are known about the potential dangers/toxicity that may arise from the recreational abuse/use of ethylphenidate. The purpose of this thread is to document discussion, experiences and gather information relating to ethylphenidate, so as to gain a greater understanding of this promising new compound.​

***Although the degree to which ethylphenidate is consumed is entirely at the discretion of the user, a cautious and considered approach is strongly recommended when using ethylphenidate, be it for recreational purposes or otherwise.*​**​

Note:


*Please be aware that the abbreviation "EPH" is, at least in the United States, used for the unrelated stimulant drug [ephedrine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephedrine).  Please use this abbreviation with care as to not confuse these two drugs.*

In my experience, Ethylphenidate is only hard on your heart if you combine it with other drugs or medication. On it's own, it elevates my heart-rate a bit, but coffe is much worse. But taken with downers or other uppers, Ethylphenidate turns evil and causes arrythmia, high bp, heart rate +120 ....


I'm not saying this to point at the other users here. In fact, i myself can't resist it and combine it with alcohol all the time - wich is about the worst combination for your heart as my bp-monitor and doctor keep telling me. I say this to stress the fact that with stimulants, esp. ethylphenidate, it makes a huge difference if you take it with or withour other substances. Some stimulants (like EPH IME) can be ne worse than coffee on their own - but turn into hell when combined with anything.

Myself and a friend just did a gram between us over 12-14 hrs i was perfectly fine, but my friend has uncontrollable muscle movements, complete loss of balance, stumbling and tripping and falling easily. Only difference is she had two beer and i never. The previous time she did this she was perfectly fine, and had no reactions and she has never had reactions to ritalin either...I worried about her and wondering if anyone has heard of this or has any idea of what to do. She has no headache, nausea or dizzyness  or anything just no balance, cannot walk without loss of coordination, had a gataroade bottle full of water and currently getting a small snack to see if it helps. It has now been 12 hrs since she had any of this product and her symptoms has not gotten any better. Anyone have any ideas?

I just get some of that and took some 2hours ago orally, i kept it 5 min in my mouth and swallowed it, was a bit impatient to feel some effects so i ve snorted two lines riight after. I didn't want to snort it anymore but it definetly gaves me better stim effect. Oral dose can make you easilly back awake when you feel like sleeping but as others said it make me feel really bad and benzo does not quite target this feeling it s like your heart is dead guilty like you re a monster and it can last ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)

Interesting, I've never drank on it, maybe give that a shot. Also how does bombing ethylphenidate effect you? Jittery or a bit more pleasant?

After abusing eph a few months back, its one of the chems i can have and not take very often, if at all as of late. 


I mean a reasonable dose or two, in moderation, once or twice a month is fine. But when your up for days, taking gram amounts in a matter of days, snorting WAY too fucking much of this stuff, it just gets nasty. 


Benzos don't help, alcohol doesn't help, kratom doesn't help, its the chemical itself for me personally. But like i said, it can be used responsibly.


Just don't think taking a gram or more  of this stuff in a timeframe less than a week, is a good idea. EPH is a pretty rough stimulant imho, and its fairly hard on my cardiovascular system/feels way to edgy. 


Abusing this stuff really sucks, and its pretty rough on your body/mind. Don't fuck around and moderate your usage and you'll be thankful you did in retrospect, if your taking these ridiculous amounts of the stuff, especially nasally. That really fucks with the tissue up there bigtime.


But i won't flush it, because used in moderation, its not that unhealthy/a decent high used infrequently, and not staying up for days or going through 100's of mgs a day, let along grams. If you want to do that to your body/mind, thats not for me to tell you otherwise, but i do not recommend it going from personal experience here.

Haha. A couple of years ago I hated EPD, and usually ended my binges with flushing it down the toilet. Now, after trying 3,4-CTMP I really **miss** EPD, especially the large crystals that were available a few years ago and now again, lukckily) No small crystals, no powder, has ever come close to the euphoria and rush like the large EPD crystals give me.


Regarding alcohol, I would **never **take EPD without alcohol. Alcohol takes away the anxiety and jitteriness, and makes it more euphoric. Benzos are good for the comedown, but don't go well togehter with EPD otherwise IME.

Is this a subjective thing or would others also agree that the large crystalline EPH-Synthesis has more euphoric (or different) properties as the 'regular' powdery/(small)crystal batches? 


I mean even the vendor says there's no difference in quality/purity etc. besides the actual appearance.

Most people seem to agree that the large crystals were superior. The powder was supposed to burn less when snorted, but at least for me the horrible sting from the powder lasted for like 30 minutes, I got headache from the pain and watery eyes. But when I crushed crystals and insufflated it, it did indeed sting but not for nearly as long as the powder, and not as badly at all. So the crystals burned much less in my nose. Also, the powder produced more nasty side effects for me, especially horrible anxiety and very scary heart palpitations more easily. Plus, the crystals had a more rapid come-up and rush. I've used EPD enough to not attribute this to placebo.


I'm not going to say the crystals were easy on my nose though, my first week long binge resulted in almost all nose hair gone and the inside of my nostrils had turn grey. I also suspect my sense of smell was lowered for a while after that binge.

Many thanks for sharing your findings ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) 


I've a sample of those large crystals but haven't tried them to date, not just because i haven't had the urge to do some EPH but also because i thought it's 'just' plain EPH with a different, and in all honesty, absolutely stunning appearance. 


From what i've heard now i think i should try them asap ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

Man, this stuff really is painful on the nose but provides a very decent buzz. The sublingual route works great. I tried it with cottonmouth and just let the crystals dissolve slowling under the tongue and fuck! It scarred the shit out of the whole area...As has been said, very caustic.

**Advice for people using Ethylphenidate**


So this substance has become increasingly popular and people in my area are now selling it as mephedrone.


The first time i did it i was silly and did big lines and just felt incredibly ill and had temporary drug induced psychosis.


It seems that with this stimulant the mental focus and euphoria and 'content' feeling fades WAY before the physical effects do. and i mean i am talking like 9 hours before you can actually sleep.  So the advice is to ALWAYS have some type of benzo to take after (and in some cases during) your sessions. I had not slept for 3 days because of misuse of this substance and started to hear voices. But with the help of sobriety and lots and lots and lots of fruit i felt better within a few days.


Also My advice from ongoing use of this in the lab has shown that if u are insufficating it make sure to grind it as fine as possible as this stuff will rot and eat away at your nose. So its important to keep cleaning and blowing your nose in-between dosing. (going in the shower and snotrocketing works a treat, yes its gross bus its better than having no septum)


too long didn't read?: make sure you have benzos, take time between doses, clean your nose frequently and make sure you dont go past 2 days without any sleep.


Kind regards to everyone even if this helps one person its great!![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif)

Do you personally think a nasal spray and the nose washing would apply to a single session of 100mg and would be necessary? I'm getting like .1 or .2 at a time, total of a gram, but spread out like a week and a half or two or three apart. Like I have restricted and limited access to it.

Personally, I think if you need benzos, alcohol, or opioids to make your ethylphenidate experience tolerable, you are using way too much.

Tried this chem twice from two different suppliers. 


Still undecided as to the therapeutic benefits but would concur that as a recreational stimulant it is not viable due to the short action of actual 'effect'.


It is kind of like 4mmc in that it provides an instant stimulant 'hit' but this fades very quickly, prompting frequent re-dosing which inevitably leads to uncomfortable OD...


Okay in very small doses as a social aid.

Now when i snort it i always use the same nostril, don t want to waste both of them, i ve got the small crystal version, i think by breaking it as thin as possible make it easier on my nostril or maybe just lost sensivity... clearing the nose high pressure and snort water seems to help recover faster, never tried it with alcohol but i still vulnerable with following the line though. the more u take the more u will be meditating for a restless sleep and it can be almost a day, u feel physiollogically tired and don't want to do a shit but the dopamine in ur brain will keep on messing arround in some part of ur brain anarchically way and will keeps u awake.. i know that too much haha

First time on eth or any RC (newbie here)


Ok so it's 11:49am, woke up about an hour ago still feeling rather sleepy. I discover my gram of ethylphenidate has arrived in the post today, and considering doing things like cocaine in the morning was nothing new to me what the hell i decide to crack it open, but feeling rather optimistic whether this perfect-white shiny powder (powdered sugar looking) is going to have any effect on a heavy duty cocaine user like myself.

so i go ahead and sort a small line... like i thought rubbish.... (and hardly to no pain as many people describe, just an odd smell) only thing i feel is a slight tightness around my nose..... 

About 5-10 mins pass... Hold on Hold on Hold on.. Oh hello Ethylpenidate, it's nice to meet you! i'm over whelmed by having the exact same feeling around my eyes, nose and head are clearly being held tight by the eth (the feeling i love from coke) also getting a tightness around the chest, and the typical "jittery feeling" people are commonly describing in this thread, heart rate increased but it's not really bothering me at all, and massive jump in focus. Let me clarify it's nowhere near the leagues of coke, but it's definitely A-OK.  To put it simply for people like myself who literally just wanted to know one thing. How does it compare to coke? Basically feels like mediocre coke. In the past i have had worse coke than this funnily enough (street coke), but don't get your hopes too high coke this will never be a copy.

Is it safe to mix ethylphenidate with NSAIDS like Aleve(naproxen)

I used ibuprofen and aspirin every single day that I ever used ethylphenidate. I can't imagine anything bad happening because of it.

30mg oral dose:  Felt slightly more focused during the day. No real negative effects, but no very powerful other effects either. Mild. Couldn't sleep 7 or so hours after this small dose and 1mg etizolam was needed rest.


60mg+45mg (oral) topup one hour in: overwhelming negative physical effects felt after about 5 hours in. Felt good but almost slightly anxious. A lightly anxiogenic compound. Later on when i had to interact with some old friends i felt slightly "robotic" and not particularily happy per say, more just on neutral robot mode. Doses past maybe 75mg oral will not be attempted. Perhaps this could work as a practical, functional stimulant in medium doses or in low doses a focus-enhancer for school or work, but there's probably better compounds. Even nootropics are probably more suited for schoolwork.


I may try one (1) insufflation experiment of 30mg or so but hopes are not high. Experiment will soon be terminated with this compound.

I just tried it. First I must say that these crystals are not the same as the large crystals that were sold when EPH came out on the RC market. These new crystals are VERY large but very easy to crush. Larger than the earlier large crystals, but softer. And the really interesting thing; these new crystals don't sting almost at all! EPH has always been painful to snort but this batch definitely is different. I just feel a very faint sting that disappears almost immediately. Also this new batch feels more mellow with less anxiety, but also not with the intense rush/come-up (which some hate and some love). I'd still prefer the crystals that were available a few years ago, but these are still better than the powder which sucked.


Vapourizing this stuff does not work.

I wouldn't like to comment on the specific possibility of interactions but just be aware that EPH is also a noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor so you'll be taking 2 drugs with the same basic action.

You should also specify which country you are talking about. It's banned in many European countries already, e.g. Sweden and Finland (most of the RC's sold by British vendors have been illegal for quite some time especially in the Nordic Countries, who ban new compounds almost a few weeks after they've hit the market sometimes).


Our authorities here are bizarrely quick to ban new compounds, it seems RC's are a huge target in the Nordic's now. Also, at least here (Finland) customs can confiscate stuff they consider "harmful" without any evidence. E.g. Diclazepam will be stopped at the border if caught (and the one who made the order will maybe have to pay fines) because it is "too much like diazepam". That's how it works here. Fortunately there are ways to fool them. Many vendors have even stopped shipping to Finland, Sweden, Norway and Denmark because of the insane amount of resources that's put down to catch a parcel with 1 mg substance X (plus I suspect our authorities put quite a lot of pressure on the biggest Polish vendors who all just at once suddenly announced they "don't ship to Finland or Sweden anymore".


Gosh, of my 10 last orders 9 came through. What a waste of resources from customs. Ok, a little bit off topic here...

Haven't heard anything of a UK ban personally? Normally the fire is preceded by some very visual smoke here.


I have some excellent quality stuff here atm, making for a very pleasurable afternoon, very clear headed, good body buzz, minimal peripheral effects. This is with 20mg oral and a further 25mg up each face nostril over the course of 2 hours

Do you have the large crystals? Strange, this is my, well not third, but almost, day on it. And now, no matter how big lines I snort I get *sedated*. I get a calm feeling of serenity, like a mix of benzos and opiates. Before this the batch worked like it should (i.e. stimulating)


Any explanation for something so bizarre? I haven't taken extra benzos or alcohol either.

Do you know what? I DO actually. On both counts I mean, large crystals and the sedated feeling. I put it down to the etizolam and red wine I had before it...

Exactly, it feels like I've taken a massive dose of diazepam, not really awake but not asleep either. Something fishy about this new batch? Maybe would be a good idea to mail the vendor to re-check their EPH. I'm almost 99% certain we have got it from the same UK vendor(s), which have the same batch of the large crystals. No other vendors even have them.


Edit: But the thing is I can't complain, I feel absolutely wonderful. I just usually get to this state of mind with other compounds than stimulants.


I mean this stuff is known for it's harsh comedown, not for containing a slow-release dose of benzos to be activated when your binge is over.

Possibly getting too close to the mark here, but the vendor that advertises the crystals as such? (apologies mods if that's too close to source detail)


Definitely no complaints here either, I feel superb, alert, yet calm, collected and steady.Focused.


Maybe this is what it's meant to be like? A new, purer batch without some more classically stimulating contaminant? 


Now there's the hypothesis of a stimmed-up mind ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

Yes, initially there was one in particular who advertised them. However they are not the only vendors advertising the large crystals anymore.


But yes, I do think the mods dislike us playing a bit with fire here.

After using up my 2 grams, I really do feel like this was a "chilled-down" version of EPH. Sure, I had my moments of anxiety and panic (wouldn't be EPH without them), but otherwise this batch felt more mellow. I mean it in a good sense, the powder was awful. Nothing but extreme anxiety and a sting in the nose that laste for ages.


Anyone else agree that this is the batch that stings the least by far?

How's your heart rate on this? And did you say you'd been.going for 3 days? How are you holding up? I normally try and limit my binges, but a rare 5 dayer left me completely physically drained for 8-10 days!

Older batches felt like snorting salt ![:|](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eyesclosed.gif) A real back of the throat tearful sting! This is pretty smooth though, doesn't feel physically corrosive for a change!


No anxiety so far either, a pleasant surprise! ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

My heart rate is quite fine now, I can't say any exact numbers but I didn't at any point get the feeling I often do that I'm getting a heart attack (I believe you seldom are in an acute danger on EPH although one may sometimes feel so, when you're pondering whether to call the ambulance or not, it's the anxiety and fear that makes you scared, more scared than on any stim I've tried. Heart races on EPH scares me shitless)


I've taken this now for almost exactly 36 hours, so two nights without sleep. I feel sleepy, but I get even sleepier if I try to snort more. And a marvelous lack of any comedown. At this point I usually feel like murdering someone, angry like hell, but now I'm just very calm. And I still have to mention my nostrils are just fine ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


Edit: My heart rate is definitely heightened, there's no way I could sleep now without benzos, but at least the heart rate is not annoyingly fast, just a bit elevated.


Edit2: The vascoconstriction is, as usual, strong.

Edit3: This batch suppressed my appetite more than any other.

Edit4: I still haven't changed my mind that EPH is best served together with alcohol (if there's no alcohol a few etizolams makes it more enjoyable too)

It's an odd feeling, the feeling of calm sedation, combined with the knowledge that you wouldn't have a hope in hell of sleeping!


I suffer from panic attacks normally, but I vividly remember my first EPH derived one. Genuine fear of Cardiac arrest, heart rate must have been 180+ :/


The brain, stimulants and positive feedback are a scary combination!

I think just about everyone who've used EPH at least a few times have experienced a panic attack or extreme anxiety, combined with hypertension (or the feeling that your heart will collapse). I don't know exactly what makes it differ from other stims in this particular regard, I've taken too much speed a few times and was just (by far) too tweaked up, nothing more. But too much EPH feels like you're going to die. I guess taking too much EPH feels more dangerous than it is because it is exacerbated by the intense fear and panic. I've always found it quite hard to find the sweet spot both dose wise and regarding the time between the doses.


Oh well, for me no other drug deserves the "love-hate" title as much as EPH.

It's a real "never again" drug that you miss, and order straight away again isn't it, as soon as the panic attack  or comedown subsides!

Sorry if this has been talked over at length already, but I haven't really been following this thread...I have used the search engine and short of reading this entire thread to answer a simple question it didn't provide me with any sort of quick and dirty answer:


What's the digs regarding IV'ing this stuff? I've only snorted/eaten/plugged it (different ROA work best in different circumstances) and to be honest I won't be diving into IVing this stuff...however friends of mine are keen as beans to bang some, but I've managed to talk them into letting me do some research before they dive in head first.


1) It hurts quite a bit going up the nose- I mean, it's nowhere nearly as bad as meth or any of the 2Cs...but it definitely hurts more going up the tooter than methylphenidate does (I've snorted extracted MPH several times, only a moderate burn). Is this shit really harsh to IV? I'm assuming that missing will be pretty bad/painful, more than 'usual'...but is it quite painful to IV in general?


2) What sort of a reduction in duration is there? IV methylphenidate really doesn't last that long at all, especially once you get  bit of a tolerance. Is this the same with ethylphenidate? I ask mainly because I and a lot of other people seem to (subjectively) find that it seems to be a bit weaker by weight, but a little longer lasting. Also is the IV bioavailability as you'd expect? I.e. a bit weaker by weight than IV methylphenidate?


3) How bad is the crash? I know that it's pretty moreish, no doubt even more so when IV'd, so how much you take will play a big part in how bad the crash is- but to generalise how bad is the crash? How does it compare to say, methylphenidate, methylone/mephedrone, MDPV Dexamphetamine and/or Meth.


4) Does it have any little 'quirks', as some RCs have? Like how *nothing* and I mean ***NOTHING*** makes you as horny as IV-ing MDPV (the MDPerVert rush)? Or how using Mephedrone for extended periods of time results in purple fingertips/knees and terrible BO?


And finally...


5) How's the rush? How does it compare to methylphenidate? 


I'm looking for generalised answers to these questions so that I can tell these fools (my friends can be such fucking munters sometimes) what they're getting themselves into. You don't need to tell me not to do it because I'M not going to be IVing any of this shit! I favour it because it's an RC (cheap & available) and is very useful orally as a sort of 'caffeine plus'. Seriously, I'm a downer guy- if I have to be up early and on the ball I'll often take 25mg of EPH orally with my breakfast (in appropriate circumstances, obviously) or if I'm feeling lazy on a Friday or Sat and being dragged to a party I'll snort 50mg to get out the door- that's the extent of my EPH abuse, not much to say.


But my friends are more or less gonna IV this regardless of what I do say- they very well may have already banged a little bit. But never the less they said that they'd hold off until I could do a little research. So come on people- help a fella out. 


Thanks muchly in advance.

I feel like I should reply, even though I'm afraid I don't have the answer ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png) As a non needle user, I don't even have a point of reference :/


All I would say, if they're gonna do it, they're gonna do it. Lower the dose, use sterile equipment, for gods sake use a micron filter... All the usual IV caveats.


Have someone there who's staying relatively in control, not using that ROA.


And well... Enjoy it. I Really hope it's fucking awesome, because it's a chemical close to my heart, and I want people to enjoy it! ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

Would a micron filter really be necessary for EPD from a lab that's known to be over 99% in purity with their products?


I also don't have advice for dosing. I'd assume effects to be similar to iv methylphenidate, and I've heard of doses from 10-100 mg. best to give them the lower end of that spectrum to avoid getting blood on your hands.

Did your rectum burn another hole in itself? I'm getting some soon and I'm only going to try oral/insufflated. I don't shoot much drugs, and probably wouldn't plug anything again since a bad experience with 2ct7 years ago.


Are you high at least? Can you compare it to snorting 85mg?

Nope, 8.5ml of solution at 10mg/ml was sufficiently dilute to not burn and a small enough volume to be effective


Very fucking effective, I am spannered. Got a rush, almost felt serotonergic, but after careful consideration, I'm drowning in non-reuptaken dopamine! ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

Maybe. I'm not sure. I used to plug it, when I was compulsively using. After a while it doesn't work that way anymore. That is my experience. But the rush is great, as you say.

There are batches and there are batches. The small crystals made me feel like going into cardiac arrest, and just suddenly, without any big redosing. Just bang, and I felt like I was dying. I'll keep to the large crystals hereafter.

Maybe it was because I was using it too often, but I couldn't think straight on ethylphenidate. Thank goodness I've been off it long enough to realize how shitty it really is. Getting stuff done is out of the question unless what you want to get done is sit at the computer surfing the net.

I find the comedown terrible if you have no downers.

Maybe you guys are doing it too much or too late in the day? I know the latter might come down to whether or not you can schedule it in your days, but I started about 6 hours and some ago, used 250-300mg I'm estimating.. I noticed short-lived rushing euphoria on the come-up, with residual euphoria for about an hour? and then minor residual stimulation after-effects for about 2 hours. Then I redosed, so I don't know how long it would be like that for. The come-up is the best part. When the pain starts mid-line, a tear falls down my cheek, you tilt the head to either side, and go down for the other line. That moment following the second half your dose and begin to tilt your head again to complete the ritual, and notice the pain is already gone from your one nostril, and you begin to rush like hell.. .... This is fuckin mephedrone. I got ripped off. Or at least deceived..


But when the high sets in the timely mephedrone fashion, it shows itself, naked a raw, as a new lover to its mate... And it's beautiful, and I love it like I would a lover. Idk if ill get more, but its got to be as good as mephedrone, all things considered. At least at first.


I would assume if the mephedrone analogy continues, most of the problems will show up with continued use of this drug. A comedown, lessened euphoria, paranoia, psychosis, even comparable potential for addiction? I know mephedrone was the one drug I used that ever caused me a problem. Mostly because we bought it like 500grams at a time, and I always got, at least, a QP to myself to sell(already paid for by the people who'd front us the $ + a finders fee for our source since it was as cheap as a bottom-shelf bear on special, per gram.. I've never heard of anyone getting it cheap per quantity, but would welcome a dick-sizing opportunity on this one), or to use/give away/whatever. 


Give everyone a chance to respond to that. I'm a little more comfortable with this drug&dose as it sets in. Like 30-45 mins after dosing, the gems of the high come to the surface a bit more. Repeating a bit, but the rush is a little too much to handle at a 100mg dose, IMO.

Btw I would say its 2/3rds as potent by weight as mephedrone, for those trying to dose it and feel the full effects. I think when I was first tried drone, back before it was really popular, practically unheard of in the states, bob lob gave me like a .1/.15 dose. I did half of a dose, and was turned off by the pain, like some of you are to ethylphenidate burn. But he said "dude, you HAVE to finish the dose.. Please, I'll give you it, but do it right." Of course he said test allergies, we knew that, drug-smart. So powered through the dose, and hardly before getting done the second line, I felt the best I've felt from a drug, to date. 


Today's 40mg test dose of ethylphenidate, it was pretty good. Noticeable more potent than mephedrone, but I felt like I wasn't getting all there was to offer. So I dumped a little more out, came out to 2 lines of about the same size as the first. I did one, and I was expecting to have the house for at least an hour, but I heard my dad pulling into the driveway like right after I did the second of my lines, and I wasn't about to have drugs just chilling on a plate, so I railed that one too.


.. Bad idea. Idk what I expected to happen, but he comes in the house, yelling my name. I wiped off the plate, put some decoy food on it, and sat it down. I teared up, wiped it and my nose, and stalled for maybe 30 seconds. Max. I have to reply with something, but I'm choking on powder. And I'm already much, much, too high for the situation that's about to go down, well aware there's no way I'm peaking yet. So I cough out as best as I could "I just f-(cough) finished flushing my sinuses. I can't talk right now." Think about it for a sec, and say "give me like 2mins or so."


Well I guess he buys that, because what other choice does he have. It actually got a little easier to talk as the irritation from the powder went down, but I kept sentences short and concise, and no small talk. I would consider myself a veteran, and the probably 150mg I ended up using was hard to handle.


So basically to sum it up, when I would tell everyone to weigh out 150mg of drone to use as a first-time, go-for-broke dose, I would say probably 100mg here would be appropriate. If you want the same level of intensity in your experience.

I got a little bit of this today, just enough to get under your fingernail. 


I apologize in advance to you kind hearted people here on bluelight for not following the normal, proper and VERY IMPORTANT guidelines of safety reduction. However, this post does matter as this is a new chemical that's been around for maybe 3 years and not a lot of things are known about it. In order to fill that gap and satisfy my masochistic drug tendencies ( mostly the 2nd) I administered a first eyeballed dose of what i would say was 40-50mg via the intravenous R.O.A.


Within a minute or less, I felt some nausea and a gentle rush. Very pronounced euphoria, comparable for me to MDPV and better than a Pentedrone-3mmc mix. I felt empathy, immediately began to feel chatty and warm to the other person that was in the house with me at that moment. It feels quite good. I then did another dose ~1 hour after that, double in size or maybe a bit more than the first. It's been another hour and even though the rush has subsided in ~30-40minutes, I still feel pronounced euphoria and empathy, as well as a weird stimulation (I feel tired, but wouldn't lay my head on a pillow for a pound of gold), loss of apetite, frequent urination (well, only 2 times) and an overall feeling of well-being mixed with a lazy me-me-me.


Perhaps you'll get more out of it if i structure this by replying to someone else.

You don't need to tell me not to do it because I'M not going to be IVing any of this shit! I favour it because it's an RC (cheap & available) and is very useful orally as a sort of 'caffeine plus'. Seriously, I'm a downer guy- if I have to be up early and on the ball I'll often take 25mg of EPH orally with my breakfast (in appropriate circumstances, obviously) or if I'm feeling lazy on a Friday or Sat and being dragged to a party I'll snort 50mg to get out the door- that's the extent of my EPH abuse, not much to say.

1) Yes, it is harsh on the veins. I missed a little out of the first shot and it stings like antibiotics shots in the ass. Also, a large bump has formed even though there was very little that didn't hit.

2)Rush lasts 30-40 minutes. It goes down on the timescale at the second redose. I expect it to follow this trend. I will also edit this post later on, before leaving for work. I can't answer on how it is compared to methylphenidate, as I do not know how methylphenidate is.

3)Will answer when I crash. So far, it is moreish, but it doesn't hold a candle to MDPV.

4)Can't say yet.

5)The rush is a 7/10. Can't compare it to methylphenidate, but compared to MDPV it's gentler, subtler and just as euphoric. So far, I would actually tend to recommend this drug to someone seeking a chilled out stimulant. 


Tell your friends that the hypocrite said they shouldn't I.V. chemicals with no less than 60 history of human use if they really have to.

Two weeks ago i took a small dose 2c-c (15mg) which i wanted to combine with some MDMC later on. But i had only 50mg left, so i added 10 or 15mg EPH to it. After snorting this the psychedelic effects increased greatly to a very nice and euphoric high.

I had the combination of 2c-c and MDMC before (although with 80-100mg MDMC). After snorting the MDMC solo there was increased empathy and stimulation, but almost no increased psychedelic effect.


Does EPH synergise with psychedelics or empathogens? I think someone on bluelight (not sure if it was in an EPH-thread or somewhere on PD) posted that EPH boost psychedelics a lot. I didn´t think of this, when i mixed the MDMC with EPH, i just added it because i didnt have any MDMC left.

I've come across a powder I believe might be ethylphenidate. I've read around a bit and there's two things I'm curious about I haven't seen around so far.


First, any particular smell of this stuff? My stuff smells funny. Not sure how to describe it. Second, vaporizing. Haven't seen much said about it... once guy said some crystals didn't produce an effect vaped. I'm about to try vaping some now. I'm tolerant to stims currently but I'm treading carefully in these unknown waters. Personally, I think you can never be too safe with stims. They're just rough on the body. 


Anyways, guess I'll start with 10mg in the pipe. I like to use hemp wick as it burns at a lower temp than butane lighters. An hour ago I did a tiny-sublingual allergy test then proceeded to insufflate 20mg. Keeping a dose journal. Definitely can handle more -- but I'm always wary about the physical side effects. I like plugging drugs but I don't fuck around with my bum. Will only put certain compounds I know to be more gentle on the rectum. I love my prostate orgasms so I'm very careful here.


Edit: Oh yeah, and the guys a few pages back talking about getting calm sleepy stimmy high a ways into their binge -- I know that so well. It's very odd... I've tried to find out the facts/science behind that but haven't turned up much. Pretty sure low blood sugar / lack of sleep after a while is where this comes in. Sometimes I enjoy it, others not as much.


This stuff smells/tastes too funny to enjoy vaping. Only way I could describe it is fishy-chemicaly. Vaping produced effects just fine, and I really like vaping some stims, but this just tastes too wild.

Cos I've got 500mg due in the post today. Was oral dosing just the same as the powdered type in affects? Also how different is the large crystal in affects and pain compared to the powdered?


Someone mentioned on here that the large crystals aren't as painful on the dose.

I actually took around 40mg orally when it arrived before and I'm liking it. For me I found it pretty speedy, alert, clear headed, sharp, motivated and anxiety free. I'll try sniffing another day. It's definitely more euphoric than the powdered EPH.


Also I ordered 500mg and my vendor sent me 1g by mistake. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Anyone else been getting mouth ulcers from EPH? I have been oral dosing around 80mg everyday for the past 3 days. Does anyone know what this could be? I had been chewing a lot of gum, just in case it was down to gurning, but I find EPH to not cause much teeth grinding for me anyway. I have never had this from any other stimulants.

I just got a batch in, and tried preparing a bit of ethylphenidate nasal spray, 2.5mg per spray. Still burns a decent bit, so I added 0.1% lidocaine. Took away the burn, but still left my nose runny for a solid hour.


Overall I'm thinking oral is the only decent ROA here.

I have heard that plugging works fine and is minimally irritating as long as you use a reasonable volume of water to predissolve the eph, say 4-5 mL.


It may also be worthwhile to see if its a pH problem, and if so, maybe adjust it closer to neutral. I bet ethylphenidate HCl is acidic.


> Anyone else been getting mouth ulcers from EPH?

> Click to expand...


If it's a cold sore, those are typically stress induced. If it's a true mouth ulcer (open wound) then it's probably from unconsciously biting or rubbing your gums/cheeks. Wikipedia has some [causes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth_ulcer#Mechanical) listed.

I think you should clarify how long a "session" is? 12 grams is kind of ridiculous, I think you would run the risk of just collapsing after that.

I thought i would add my thoughts to this thread after testing this drug over the weekend, it was the large crystal batch. ........ at 6pm i started off with a dab to test before racking up 2 small lines 50 mg a line didnt feel much, but after 10 mins my eyes opened slighty not much else so i decided to have another 50 mg line.  Its just hit 8pm. my missus was due around so i bombed 150mg sniffed 50 mg and hid the stash. In total i took 0.35 over 2hours wasnt what i was hoping for altho it did wake me up slight buzz but was missing something.  Now this is where it got interesting my missus arived 8.30pm with vodka i drank a few glass by 11 pm this stuff kicked me in the teeth, i was lay down watching tv then bam my eyes literally felt like they were about to pop out of my head had an urge to smoke so i made a big joint bad idea as after a strong sativa joint my heart went on a mad one 130 bpm it felt like this was the come up 3 an a half hours after my last dose i know how to control my body but for some1 who doesnt i can imagine this stuff scarying the life out of some people definitly dont compare this to speed ecstasy or coke, dont try reaching a high that just isnt there it is very moreish i wanted to do alot more than i did be careful with this one less is more, big doses of this stuff will reak havoc with your heart play it safe you wont get a coke speed or ecstasy effect so dont go mad looking for that high as you wont find it and you could seriously harm yourself. Ps had a few vodkas and a few spiffs so this may sound abit mish mashed

hi everyone im newly signed up to bluelight, long time viewer. 


The particular phase im going through at the moment is ethylphenidate, mpa, and etizolam and pyrazolam for the dark side. Its been mentioned somewhere before where someone mixed eph and mpa, but I was wondering if anyone has any experience in doing this and if its going to I dunno make my spleen radioactive or some shit.


I used to smoke spice gold daily for over a year though so any damage ive done to my chromosomes is all sorted, as well as various forays in the use and abuse of a few illegals.


Can anyone else make an educated guess for me if I mix the two together in one rail, preferably without drinking alcohol? My main and only method is insufflation because parachuting things never really seems to work for me so il be snorting it

Something I personally was wondering to those who have tried both MPH and EPH.


I have a very big Rx to both Concerta (54mg) and Focalin IR 10mg (dexmph). Is there any reason whatsoever that I should try EPH? I am assuming that insufflated Focalin (especially when extracted from the tablets) would provide a superior buzz?

Shocker here, I pH tested my solution of Ethylphenidate HCL in saline (2.5mg/100μL) and got 8.8! I tried neutralizing the pH down to 7.2 with hydrochloric acid, and it no longer irritates my nose to an appreciable amount.


In fact, when I'm already on Clonidine I'd actually call it a decent stimulant, just rather short acting and not very productive in comparison to others.

well yeah ive just done it hhaha, sod waiting around for advice. I'm going to get flak for this but ive never owned scales ,not even for when I used to buy 20bags of weed. I did the small and work my way up technique until I had a nice mixture of the somewhat powdery mpa, and around half the relative amount of the 'I assume' denser eph. and just railed it with some genuine etilaams under my tongue.


moderate/severe balancing issues when walking around, severe typing issues its taken me bloody ages to type this, and what id describe as a nice, mildly euphoric, warming relaxing high for the purposes of lying down in bed. cant imagine myself following any kind of tv programme or film in this state but I was being cautious with the amounts,


might try hyping up the ratios tomorrow night, but this could easily turn into a habit, which wont be good. anyway im going to sleep now

Tried out a 2mg dose of EPH today while on Selegiline 5mg. Really awesome combo, far less tweaky than just EPH and more euphoric. BP never got into the hypertensive range.


Just of course remember that high doses of classical stims on an MAOI can easily kill you, so start small!

am I the first idiot to snort a line of Methiopropamine along with a slightly lesser amount of Ethylphenidate together, in the same line, at the time time, up the same nostril??


Because if I am, then wtf. Are my arteries constricting or some shit? I feel alright though, just having a beer and a fag

So that must have been the freebase then!? My vendor derped a bit.


Alright, so apparently I was actually making enough eph HCl out of freebase eph to get to a roughly neutral pH, results in fewer nasal problems.

I'd say roughly 2:10 on potency. This is due to selegiline blocking the enzyme MAO-B that normally oxidizes dopamine, simply resulting in more dopamine around. This has the added benefit of really cutting down on dopamine-oxidation induced neurotoxicity, but the downside of making ODing quite easy if you aren't careful about your doses.

Whoa, that is a really lot of lidocaine though. My ethylphenidate-lidocaine nasal spray required a fraction of that (I forget the exact dosage now, but it was under 1%)


**You can get into serious heart trouble from doing a really lot of lidocaine, especially if allergic.**


I have noticed my eph-lidocaine spray is actually an awesome decongestant in low doses, way surpasses phenylephrine and pseudoephedrine (but not meth).

ive never had crystalline mpa just that floury looking powder, i find mpa to be really weak compared to eph.


what do you guys recommend as a good natural way to wind down, like without benzos. yes i have some on standby, never fear, but id really like to abstain from using them unless i need to because i get stupid with these two together.


also, does anyone else here like to vaporize this stuff

i threw a little chunk of crystal in there (apx 5-10mg no i dont have a scale at this current time) and melted it halfway before it started turning yellow, inhaled all the vapor i could (im really bad at chasing i almost never do it) and got a nice little rush, but nothing like some good rock would give me, though it lasts a hell of a lot longer.


im not confident that i vaped it properly, though.

Can you safely combine a small dose(15-30mgs) of Ethylphenidate with a 100mg dose of 5-apdb? I find 5-apdb to be little lacking on it`s own.

Hi everyone, this is my first thread on bluelight but I am a long time reader on recreational drug advice, I have read through this thread to try an find the topic of conversation I would like to talk about but there has been no detailed post that I can see, so I hope it is ok for me to just jump in an post this :-S


I have been taking Ethylphenidate powder and crystal nasally for a few months now an it has come to the point were when I insufflate a line it stings so much that my eyes water for a good hour, my nose runs a pink liquid an stings for hours after, my concern is has the  Ethylphenidate been eating away at the inside of my nose ?, what damage could it have done ?, how long will it take for my nose to heal an go back to normal now iv stopped taking it ?, and is there anything I can take or do to my nose to help it heel ?. Any advice would be much appreciated ![:-)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) thank you.

You really shouldn't be sniffing this for more than a few days in a row. I did once and had nose bleeds (I'm prone to them anyway and also get them when I'm about to be sick... got that from my dad) for about a week. Was fine after that.


Try either rectal (no it's not gay) or oral, at least for me these produce no noticeable damage.

I myself snorted ethylphenidate for a good three to four months, a few to 10 times a week. My left nostril is now missing a fair bit of the thingy that it had before. According to my limited knowledge of anatomy, it ain't coming back. Really wish I hadn't gone so overboard with it (or at least stuck to using oral).

Do your self a big one, and quit using nasally. I rmember the icky gooey liquid also, with horror.

Damn, that sounds horrible, does it bother you in any way? Luckily I stopped quickly after the nose bleeds and everything healed up fine. 1 day per week or two weeks doesn't appear to cause me any problems (guess the nose bleeds are annoying but also nice since they start whenever my nose gets too irritated (also, funny thing, a day or two before I get a cold). ash.sin, listen to what WranglerPants said, maybe it's not too late for you.

Well, my nose has always been twisted, so it's hit or miss, whether I'm able to breathe with my mouth closed. However, it was this way long before the insufflation started - so it isn't the fault of ethylphenidate. Still, the visual apperance of my nose & nostrils is pretty hmmm int-e-r-e-sting. Because of the large empty space where the nose-bone-goo is normally, the nostril kinda bends, like the skin lining the nose is falling. Googl for cocaine noses, and you'll see what I mean.

The most fucky part of it all, is that I at times didn't even bother to crush the crystals (!)

(not looking for a source or hints on how to find one, just some info, if the mods think this is too close to sourcing please delete it)


Do any RC vendors sell  entiopure EPH or is it all racemic? So do I just not know the right vendors, or is it not sold?


@WranglerPants:

Hope lots of people read this and are careful with nasal dosing.

Is there anything you can do to fix it? Surgery (but probably not covered by your insurance?)?

I live in a country with "free" health care, in exchange for ludacris taxes. Have considered it, however, I'm a bit weary as the rhinoplastry also has a risk of fucking it more up (happened to the only two ppl I know, who had it).

Yeah this stuff destroys your nose, moreso than any other amphetamine, cathinone, 2C or drug Ive ever snorted. After 1 week of snorting this stuff I realized how much it was destroying my nose and stopped instantly. I will not be doing that ever again. Orally this is a decent drug, but I still feel a little too rushy to help my concentrate.

And it's weird, because I did pretty decent lines and some time ago when I did Eph I was ending up with very annoyng jitterry comedown but this time I had almost no comedown, well maybe a little sadness few hours after last dose and a little faster heart rate than usual, but when you don't think about it, it goes away.  

Also, when I first time tried Eph this summer it stinged so bad I was almost crying and told myself I will never do it again. And now, around three months after not snorting eph with this new batch it stang just for like three seconds and then it was gone. Weird? Did my nose evolutionized and now I have a better, stronger nose or is it so fucked up I don't even feel pain anymore?or maybe it's some kind of new magical better batch? Those rocks lookin pretty nice!

But anyways, this drug is very very subtle. :Like I once said, if you would secretly put it in someones drink chances are they wouln't even notice any euphoric or stimulating drug effects. But it's still nice. I will like it for a while and start hating again soon I'm sure ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

What is the "cleanest" way to take Ethylphenidate ? Aside from IV, snorting, pluging. 


I've tried sublingual, dropped the powder under my tongue, it burns a bit but it's ok. But I got a bit of nausea, burning stomach. 

Is there a way to prevent this ? Like taking it with food or putting it in water and drink it ? Or is it just the way Ethylphenidate is ?


Thanks

I prefer ethylphenidate spiked smoothies over all other forms of administration.

Nah, the only drug I've ever found that actually makes a good flavoring is Oxiracetam. I've made oxiracetam sweet tea, where oxiracetam is the only sweetener.

This stuff is so so so strange. The high is so not worth the comedown... Sure, you can take little doses and just get little boosts of caffeine like energy and nose bleeds without having a shitty comedown. But if you want to get a 30 minute dopamine niceness which make you wan't to do a lot of stuff and feel good and inspirational about it you end up feeling like a fucking soulless piece of rotten shit with aching heart muscles, burning throat and bloody hurting nose. Yet still it's somehow so tempting...

yea all apologies for just jumping in... have read reports of EPH but had to chime in. wow 1st time trying it, parachuted (this is just one big guessestimate) 150mg and now adderall doesn't come close to that 'gimme more' urge. second time, snorted it like an a-hole-- maybe 80mg-- all at once without cutting it. what a nightmare!! on it now tonight and plan to carry it through the day with a hefty amount of etizolam which is a new one for me. so here's my general question: what is the maximum dosage you guys have done with EPH AND etizolam? don't know if i can handle it today with work starting at 5:00am and school between 7-10. much appreciated.

damn, too true. even just parachuting the bitch leaves me craving. if you don't mind me asking, are you alternating with other stims right now or stuck on EPH? adderall and ritalin-- even snorting them-- doesn't come close now for me! i'd hate to have go back on boystown Tina ha

Don't mind this stuff to be honest.  Used it heavily this week, like all day til bedtime.  Bombed, boofed, smoked or snorted it has different effects.  Rarely feel a bomb that much, boofing comes on more full bodied and stronger than snorting.  Or I sprinkle a layer on top of a cigarette and smoke it, with a cut off Maccys straw to get the excess smoke.  I never believed sprinking coke on a cigarette woud work but some African kid showed me to lightly wet the cigarette and then spread on.  I know you guys might say bollocks at that but I stopped vaping out of foil and do that now.  It does work.  It's never gonna be crack but it's pretty pretty good.  


Aways started EPH sessions stone cod sober.  So you reckon a can or two wil improve the euphoria?


Again,  it's an odd one for me because it realy callms me and I'm even content to  watch any old crap on the TV.

I'm stuck with this one and I do it like 3 times a week usually without redosing for study-experimental purposes but end up being bored and kind of hangover without almost any work done. In my opinion regular amphetamine would be much better. However it would probably have harsher comedown and higher addiction potential

I'm not comparing the effects (well some of them) bit this reminds me of my relationship with crack.

Hate doing it, gotta keep doing it.

Run out, relief, buy more.

Fiendish as hell, except....

When used "as directed" I put 20mgs in caps for a tripti my parents and it was great, like mega coffee.


Whenever I have a g or 2 i end up boshing the lot Well except the last about that I flush as I feel like I'm going to burst

A couple of hours later I'm looking to see if any of "the safety sacrifice" is still there, or elsewhere, crack-alike again.


I hardly use it, maybe 6 times  ever (git an early sample a couple of years ago and loved it initially. Now I'm tempted to tell my vendor to blacklist, bit there's many more to replace them.


If I have benzos, flubromazepam in particular, it's not too bad, but with just booze, or commando, it's a long  anxious night, And day, etc. Also, poly drug use isn't so clever, especially just to make one of them  bearable.


TL:DR - USe small (20-50 mg doses and you'll likely be fine, but use it like cut to fuck coke and it'll bite you


OH, it's not worth the nasal damage IMHO, never had any issues plugging. Tried IV twice, whilst in a phenazepam disaster and survived, but it'd be foolish to try that again. Not sure what the BAs are tbh.

Despite how amazing insufflation is i believe i am done after days of nose bleeds. I just let 10mg sit on the back of my hand for a few minutes, and found the skin to be quite red and irritated. Sub lingual use has resulted in a literal chemical burn, and gumming it has left a spot similar to sucking on sour candy for hours. Does anyone know if anything bad could come of this once it's in your body? Wouldn't your stomach be able to handle it since it already has acid and such.  Due to its close similarity to ritalin i wouldn't imagine it having such harmful, and immediate, physical effects.

I mainly use ethylphenidate by plugging a 40mg to 50mg dose. I`ll do anywhere between 2 to 4 doses during a day depending on what needs to be done. 


Me and the Miss just bought our first home and buzzing about the place getting things done powered by ethylphenidate really,really helps.

I've tried snorting (too painful), plugging (too gross) and bombing (doses required are too high, onset too slow)...the only ROA I use now is vaping the stuff. The effects hit instantly, with no chance of wastage. Seriously, 10 mg chased is similar to 70 mg snorted - a gram lasted me almost 2 weeks.

I got an SMS from my social security contact person today at 10:47am this morning reminding me of a meeting at 13:30pm, it's critical I show. Pretty desperate right now. I'm totally fucked  still after tonight. Did 1 gram of tramadol, divided by two primers of 100mg at 11pm, and the 400mg dose at about midnight  and then ta 100mg primer again at somewhere around 4:30am and 5 am 400mg dose an hour and a half later.,Primers orally, and 400mg ones rectally as it takes slightly less time to achieve full effect that way. Still takes at least 1.5 to 2 hours for full effects to kick in though. I also did a total of 8mg Etizolam in varying doses each time is took some Trams, started all this at about 11pm yesterdy. I managed to shower already, drunk two cups of coffee which seems to have helped some. I have prepared two bombs of Ethylphenidate, Each about 15-20mg, is it safe taking that before the meeting now. I'm heavily sedated atm, Last dose of tramadol was about 6am, so taking 15mg of Ethylphenidate after 7.5 hours, is that physically safe?. I do have ADHD but am currently not on Methylphenidate or any other stimulant than Ethylphenidate and that very rarely. A 1 gram bag has lasted me about 4-5 months now.

Well I did manage to show up at the meeting and it seems I'm fine for at least 4 more months now. Scheduled psychiatrist meeting for nest week. I did end up taking two doses of Ethylphenidate before the meeting and that went pretty okay. They were really tiny though, the first one approx 15-20mg then 10 to 15mg 20 minutes later, that was about 20 minutes before the meeting and it seemed I was actually getting away with it, like they didn't notice I was actually on anything at all. I still confessed all my habits at the end of the meeting though, dont really know why as I hate all forms of so called treatment staff, including any sort of bureucrat! With a passion! ![:X](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/mad.gif)

Definitely! I never take EPH without alcohol, alcohol makes it much more euphoric and takes away the anxiety I usually experience on EPH. However, unlike on many other stimulants (especially speed and coke) when you can drink much more than normally and it still doesn't overpower the stimulation, alcohol overpowers EPH quite easily IME.


Unlike alcohol benzos don't make EPH more fun, in fact the opposite. I only take benzos for the comedown (which is really, really nasty). In fact the comedown from EPH is sometimes so bad I often also take Lyrica and some alcohol to manage it. It's not only strong anxiety but also extreme anger and irritability.

The large crystal batch isn't painful at all to snort for me. That said, all other batches have ruined my nostrils and burnt intensely.

Hello there ! I've been lurking EPH threads for a while but they evolve too quickly, can't read everything. So I'm just reporting my experience with this chem. (about 1 month daily use)

I've been diagnosticed ADD about 8 months ago, but didn't followed the process, so I'm out of medical monitoring -> no treatment


      I knew EPH already and bought 2g. The goal was to 1. Find the dose which fits me. 2. Manage to handle with it. So my intentions were not recreational and I did not snort lines after lines to feel like "OMG I FOUND COKE FOR 15£/g I'M SO AWESOME!"


Since I had no scale, eyeballed all time, but quite good. Like expected, about 8-15mg led to increased focus and reactivity for 3 hours, then a comming down, especially hard the 3 first days (anxiety, bad mood...etc). I took 2 oral dose/day (about 11AM and 2PM) depending of my day programm and class lessons.

      This shit IS addictive, but remind yourself it's all about self-control : I said twice a day, so twice a day. In one month, I only failed 3 times, where I did continue dosing evening and night, but going to bed at 9AM was way too much cons-productive and moreover I had to get drunk to sleep, so next day was a real psychology lesson for me.

    Main problem I found with this chem is, considering same dose in every parachute (I'm quite confident, EPH does not need +/-1 ot 2 mg accurate IMO), the tolerance which installed in less than 1.5 week was progressing. The fact is that I wasn't less stimulated or  focused, but the effects were clearly shorter and shorter. Wich increased re-dosing Lust and so anxiety and paranoia in the coming down. Notice that paranoia only occured when I unvoluntarily "overdosed" commpared to 'normal' and was hard on the moment but easy to relativise after fact, althrough I had no weed but still alcool (evening).

    Oh and notice too that I had no probem eating at all (of course don't eat just after dosing) and that I forced myself to make a one-day pause every week (managed first 2weeks).

**OVERVIEW OF THE 2 FIRST WEEKS**

     Once my body got used to the substance (3 days) dosing same doses twice/day was very pleasant, helpfull (studies, work, motivation), mind-clearer, and I felt it very beneficial. I kept on wrinting reports on my computer as often as I could because it helped me to keep a scientifist approach. No one knews what I was doing but I people close to me surely saw that I was getting better. For example, they heard what I said without having to repeat 3 times until that messed me up and forced me to "scream' because I was upset to be understood (everybody tells me everyday that I'm mumbleing... It's very very boring). So a real mood improvement. Also slept quite good. The difficulty was to find the fitting dose, because I made my parachutes the day for the day so my dosing method was taking pictures ^^. but even when I underdosed, I prevent myself to redose until it's time for the second. --> Most boring side effect was really my tobacco doubled use.


    On week 3, considering this was my first 'REAL' experience with myself and a stimulant stock, I started to love stims a bit too much and started to use MPA and it began to be more difficult to accept coming down. I did a few binges, sleeping bit every day or a lot every 2 or 3 days. But I kept my idea of 2 EPH/day. Exams approaching and MPA use helping, I started to take 3 times/day but, even on MPA (drawing, seeing ppl, playing...) each time I took EPH, IT WAS TO WORK, WORK WORK, AND NOTHING ELSE. Effects were starting do really dicrease in duration and MPA which is very long stim trough only 2-3 hours of serotonic activity made the things become very hard, and the need of weed became very nasty while coming-downs (EPH and MPA). I started to become very psychotic and envisage next day sober was impossible. I finally made a 3 days break doing nothinig but sleeping, laying in bed and drinking alcool when I realized I needed MPA to clean my room or wash the dishes. 


      Week 4: Exams week, could just not stop taking MPA in school and EPH to review exams or go to exams. I'm now in hollidays and I took my last EPH parachute today after a 3 days break on wine and MPA, and tonight couldn't resist too, i'm wrinting having drank a wine bottle which did me nothing and taken big MPA parachute.


**GENERAL OVERVIEW**

     So after all, in a 33 days total EPH possession, I did it ~28 days with about (estimation with my own reports) 20mg/day first week, 30-40mg/day week 2 and 3. After that it's too hard to say. That said, I won't buy EPH again, because if you take it daily, the 3rd day, it only last 1-2 hours and it's clearly not what I need.

    About side effects, I noticed  [diarrhoea, difficulties to prevent pissing], anoying vasoconstriction which could be very pronouced like no feeling of hands in the cold, or legs refusing to respond after 15min of crossing legs. Imagine you're in a shitty amphitheater lesson, you can't take it anymore, you stand up to leave and your right leg refuse to obey everybody think you're drunk ^^). And of course the anxious / psychosis state after 'overdosing' or a too long binge ( but who doesn't know ??)


So I hope I was consistent and accurate, if you have any questions, do not hesitate !

A good day to you, Sir !

In the words of black hawk down "it's all in the grind"... When you look closely at eph, it's a crystalline compound, you have to really spend time grinding it down to as fine a powder as possible. Even then it's not gonna do your sinus any good in the long term. You could add benzocaine to it (25% benzo works) or even lactose, and that's gonna help with the sting, but even then your still snorting a powder with the consistency of ground glass almost. I really wouldn't recommend snorting it on a regular basis.

MPA is best because you don't need downers on the comedown. EPH is just mehh when taken alone, it's short lasting and the comedown is pretty shitty. I had some EPH the other day and I thought there was someone hiding in my cupboard on the comedown. With alcohol it is really nice but alone pretty shit imo. Also it doesn't give me enough energy for my liking.


I like the sober feeling of MPA and the extreme mental alertness and bouncy energy it gives me with little euphoria. The only time you need benzos with MPA is when you need to sleep cos it stays in your system for about 12 hours. MPA feels worse on the heart though and it can make you smell pretty bad with the theophene sweats and gas xD

I`ve had (what I`m guessing) a chest cold for about 2 weeks. Nothing super major,just a lot of snot in my nose and spitting out some extra thick loogies.

I also got screwed with asthma since I was 10 or 11(I`m 32 now). 


So now,whenever my asthma combines with a chest cold,my weeze kicks up into high gear and I use my inhaler/meds much more than normal.


A few days ago I noticed something different after I dosed anywhere from 20mgs to 60mgs of ethylphenidate. If I was sitting down reading a book or playing video games I was fine. But if I walked up a flight of stairs or shoveled my drive way(Western New York had a Blizzard here last week) my asthma became horribly worse.It wasn`t so much that I weezed more but a total inability to catch my breath. It was actually very scary for me. The only thing that seemed to help was trying to stay calm. 

Looking back on it,it was almost like a heavy asthma attack mixed with a panic attack once I realized I wasn`t catching my breath.

 My meds had no effect.


My girlfriend asked me if the EPH could be making my breathing worse. I didn`t think it was,so I told her no. The next day I did a small test.

  I went up and down the stairs a few times when I woke up(bedrooms upstairs and living room,kitchen,etc,etc) and noticed only my regular chest cold symptoms : out of breath/light weeze,neither last more than 2 or 3 minutes.


  Then I took 20mgs of EPH(a light dose for me). After feeling the effects,I went up and down the stairs again. Only this time I had more intense and a longer lasting "episode". It was nowhere near as bad as the first 2 asthma attacks I had from the previous day( I had also taken a 40-60mg dose and dosed more than twice that day).

I was surprised that the EPH turned out to be a factor. 


I`ve been using EPH on and off for about a year. This is the first time that I`ve noticed it having a negative effect on my breathing. Seeing as how I still have my cold,I`ve also taken a break with the EPH. Hopefully once my health returns I wont have the same negative issues with the ethlyphenidate.


One thing I wanted to mention. One of those attacks happened early in the morning after a full nights rest. If any EPH was in my system it was from the day before.

Otherwise I would be wondering if this was  a kind of amphetamine psychosis.

This really is a personal thing. I've tried MPA and it was just disappointing, felt like a caffeine pill. None of that good stuff you're describing.


Now eph even taken alone is pretty good. Low oral doses are a nice functional stim without many bad sides (ok, you do sweat like a pig). And dosed a bit higher it's quite euphoric. The comedown was never particularly bad. It could last longer, you're right about that... And with alcohol, yeah it's really good.

Hi black! I know you specifically mentioned "low oral doses" but you know stimulant junkies never keep it low, and are rarely satisfied w/ taking them orally. Been agreeing w/ most everything you've said elsewhere. especially regarding psychedelics, but it's been my experience that ethylphenidate, when used frequently, begins to show a lot of bad side effects over time, including deleterious effects on the heart, and especially anxiety. Plus there's that nasty corrosive alkalinity that's just hell on the mucous membranes. I haven't touched ethylphenidate since late August.

Mystery solved. I really am having a hard time breathing....unrelated from the EPH.


Went to my doctor`s last week and it turns out I have a chest infection along with bronchitis(along with my asthma).  Taking a course of oral steroids and antibiotics to knock it out.


I`m going to wait till I feel better to start doing EPH again.

^ perhaps you breathed some of that corrosive stuff into your lungs?

Just a theory, but from what you've said, ethylphenidate being responsible seems hard to totally rule out.

It might be a factor,if I snorted EPH. However I only take oral doses(in caps) or plug it. So off hand I don`t think the EPH is related to my health issue. I could be wrong tho...

You are either fearless, out of your mind, or both if you don't do something about it now. Saw on another post you were getting yourself checked out. I had the inhalation hiccups (cigs) all the time too. Haven't had a cigarette since the 10th! Good luck my friend.

So my company just switched me from a shift that usually has me coming home around midnight to a shift where I'm required to be there at 530am. This is a bit of a problem as my current sleep schedule has me going to bed around 4 am. I was wondering if ethyl would work as a functional stimulant to take in the morning to help me with the transition? How short lived are the effects when taken orally? What would be a good starting dose for someone who usually insufflates 20mgs/eats 30 mgs of methylphenidate?

Reset your sleep rhythm with some melatonin and you won't have to mess with ethylphenidate.

Yeah, changing a sleeping pattern is really no big deal (at least it never has been for me) and def shouldn't need ephylphenidate. If I need to get up far earlier than usual, I use doxylamine for sleep and strong coffee to wake up. You may feel disorientated for a while, but adjusting to a new routine isn't too difficult.

Yeah I've managed to make this type of transition before, it just usually takes at least a month. This time around may be a bit more difficult as I'm currently tapering off of a nightly dose of etizolam which is sure to cause additional insomnia. Doxy usually knocks me out but leaves  me feeling very dull the next morning regardless of the dose. I plan to only use EPH early in the morning when I'm running on less than 3 hours of sleep. I used to work these early shifts all the time but back then I was the boss, this time around I will be working 1 on 1 with my boss who currently thinks very highly of me. I'm hoping this stuff will keep me from making an ass of myself. I've successfully used d-amp as well as methylphenidate for similar purposes

I dabbled quite a bit with EPH quite a bit for rec, mostly vaping it, but I mostly found it a functional stim, lacking in euphoria. I do have a stash for if if I have to stay up and alert for lengthy periods of time though; I prefer it to amphetamine for this, as the crash is no big deal.

Hello, I am wondering if there is any point to ordering a gram or so of EPH even if I have pretty decent access to focalin XR, concerta, ritalin, vyvanse, and adderall IR? I've always loved methylphenidate mixed with alcohol but wonder if this substance is any better than dex/methylphenidate?

If you've got access to those kind of drugs, there's no point whatsoever in buying ephylphenidate. Just look at Ritalin; the active drug is methylphenidate-EPH is just an analog with similar effects.


The only reason to buy EPH if you've access to Ritalin, is that EPH can be smoked.

If you can get pretty much any legal stimulant that's actually approved by the FDA, then why would you bother taking a RC?

The joys of living in Europe, the only stimulant available from your doc is mpa, and even that is really hard to get.

Been agreeing w/ most everything you've said elsewhere. especially regarding psychedelics, but it's been my experience that ethylphenidate, when used frequently, begins to show a lot of bad side effects over time, including deleterious effects on the heart, and especially anxiety. Plus there's that nasty corrosive alkalinity that's just hell on the mucous membranes. I haven't touched ethylphenidate since late August.

Hi,


yeah I know, controlling your dose is hard, especially with a drug you enjoy. But eph used infrequently/and or at low oral doses doesn't feel harmful to me (and it's close cousin mph is proven to be safe at normal doses). Now high doses + nasal administration will fuck you up sooner or later, don't really thing that many people disagree with that.

I guess I don't really have one, just wanted to know if any of them were any more worth while since I haven't tried any RC stims except 4-methyl-pentedrone. Which sucked.

I played around with RC Stims  for a couple weeks and was very disappointed, especially considering the price; most of these are even more expensive than amphet sulphate or base, and for  inferior effects (at least for rec use). I'd call a lot of the Stims being punted right now "study aids" more than party drugs...and I've no use for a study aid right now.


The only one I've really heard rave reviews of was mephedrone, but I arrived to the party too late; it was a scheduled drug by the time I'd even heard of RC's. I've heard the comedown on mephedrone was a nightmare tho.

^I actually didn't find the come down from 4- mmc too bad, of course I never used more than a gram in one night.  The eph I have coming is of the d-isomer. Is all of the eph being sold the d isomer as well? Or are there different isomers out there, which would explain why effects vary from batch to batch.

I really have no idea about that tbh. the EPH I've been sold by numerous vendors has been identical in appearance, effect, etc. would d-isomer EPH  have noticeably different effects from other types of the same drug?

Of the two vendors I've asked both say they are selling racemic eph. One said that he did have a small amount of d-dph, but that it didn't sell very well because it cost more.

I hope this is the case, dosed no more than 100mg oral today with little to no side effects and got some important stuff done, and it was done properly and good.


If staying way from abusing is the key then im all for it, its so mild and 'vanilla' you barely notice the work your doing. It just flowed out of me naturally.


If you want to get fucked up invest in some MDPV and enjoy your sanity whilst it lasts.

In case you're not aware, taking methylphenidate with alcohol results in ethylphenidate as a metabolite. It's a simple substitution reaction from my understanding. This is my only experience with ethylphenidate (ie ritalin+booze), but like you, I love the synergy.

Received my bit of d-eph a few days ago, lovely large yellow tinted crystals that turn white when crushed. I planned to use it  responsibly as a functional stim for work. Unfortunately I'm starting to think that using stimulants in moderation is not possible for me as I've been binging since the day it arrived. Combining this and kratom(bali) is extremely enjoyable, kratoms vasodilation seems to counteract the vasoconstriction quite well. The pain from insufflation isn't nearly as bad as I was expecting. Seems no worse than 4-MMC, though my nose may be desensitized from extensive insufflation of 4/2-FA. Other than being back to square one with my etizolam taper it's been a very enjoyable experience .

^ The kicker is that this stuff was intended strictly for oral use only as a work aid but after testing that first 15 mg rock it was clear that the whole bag was going to end up being insufflated. I have the nasal equivalent of a needle fetish. I like the rush as well as not having to worry about having an empty stomach but I think I actually like the burn more than anything. Surprisingly my poor nose seems to be in ok shape, though my sinuses may be a different story. I have been letting it rest over the last year aside from some MXE and the occasional stim.

I know exactly where your coming from, i had the exact same experience with mephedrone when it was pure and legal. That stuff was really corrosive and burned something fierce but the intense rush which followed was well worth it and the burn just became another part of the ritual.


If you have crystally material though you can dissolve it in a mil or two of water and place it on a plate and zap in the microwave till it evaporates and then scrape the residue chem left behind.

I was kinda schocked when this stupid kitchen chemistry actually worked.


We used to do this with very shardy K, it triples in volume and decreases the same in potency.

The end result is a much much finer powder with very little to no burn, i've never seen a chem like it and i imagine it would blow away very easily so got to be careful where you put it. 8)


Bit of a strange thing to do with drugs, as obviously most people prefer strong to weak, but if you know what you have in front of you a larger amount of substance can be easier to divide between multiple people or of the chem is known to be on the strong side it will mitigate over doing it a.l.a HR.


Its pretty handy with K as you can weaken it and make sure any first timers don't go in to hard to fast as can be a problem with strong crystal K (if it even exists anymore ![:p](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)

i found auntie ethyl very interesting indeed started off recieving powder but is now crystal which i consider a step in the right direction,the innitial effects gave me a kind of confident even swaggerish cocaine style hit,a while later it delivers you into a speedy situation....the high has a constant limit so its wise to only redose after feeling the previous tailing off to get the most out of it....at its peak i feel like i could talk the hind legs off several donky's but deliver little content of real relevence or importance im quite happy to travel tangents and exchange enjoyable waffle.... 1gram to myself lasts a good 24 hours and the handover back to normality is fairly smooth its certainly an enjoyable experience all in all with little sideaffects for me personally.

*1g of ethylphenidate in a day is QUITE a lot, just in case anyone new to the substance was thinking about basing their dose around that. Be smart, and start w/ small doses until you get a feel for it.

Spot on! Just A Guy is correct, one gram over the course of a 24 hour marathon is pretty hefty. 


First time users,please don`t dose that much! Start off with a 40mg oral dose and feel your way from there. You can always take more,but you can`t magically take less.

I`ll either take 50 mgs orally for a smooth, long lasting effect or I plug 20mgs for a faster come up with stronger(but shorter) effect. 


Because I work Monday thru Friday and wake up at 5am,I limit my intake so that I can get to sleep. A gram can last me almost 2 weeks.

Eg Do you need to take more?

I've been a bit silly. Haven't done any drugs (except drinking) for about 4 years now. Used to have a REAL coke problem, lost loads of jobs, flats, self esteem bla bla you know the story.

Anyhoo, used to be able to do coke til it came out of my eyeballs and recently found out about these RCs. Bought myself a gram of Ethylphenidate and slipped it into a herbal tea. Haven't slept for 2 days, tripping out, can't eat and worse trying to hide from hubby as all he will touch is weed. Hiding in bed, praying for sleep, look like shit trying to down a bottle of red wine. Why, oh why did I not order a bag of flubromazepam at the same time?! Anyone got any tips on sleep?? Btw, I am a 28 year old female weighing 98lb. Thanks guys.

I snorted some and it felt like my eyeballs were on fire ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png) I wouldnt gum it cos it'll rot your teeth. Either slip it into a strong tasting drink or IM, or plug it. I know it sounds gross but it's prob the least damaging way to go. I tried IV and still have a huge bruise on my arm from 3 weeks ago. IM is ok, just stab yourself in the thigh.![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

^What kind of painkillers do you have?  An opiate may or may not help you sleep.  A reasonable therapeutic dose of an opiate would probably make you feel physically much better, but make sure you know exactly what you're taking and what a safe dose would be for you depending on your tolerance/lack of tolerance.  There's "painkillers" that a single pill is dangerous for someone with no tolerance, so don't just start popping whatever you find lying around the house...but that's just common sense.

GHB (etc) may help.

Wine is not such a good idea, as it will further dehydrate you.

Keep your fluids up - and even if you don't feel like it -*eat something!*

This is really important with stimulants - many of the negative effects come from the sleep deprivation/lack of nutrition/dehydration.


it seems like keeping this a secret from your husband is giving you a lot of anxiety - remember, your perceptions of these things can be blown all of proportion by stimulant paranoia.

Rather than let it eat at you all night, maybe you should think about coming clean?

Your worst fears may be a figment of the notoriously paranoid ethylphenidate comedown...

I won't get in to the whole "making myself thin for him" thing ...


It sounds like he's already noticed something's up - maybe you should tell him you fucked up a little and need to talk?

I'm not questioning the dose... but don't most people snort/plug this? Except if the pill is made to dissolve nicely plugged/sublingual.

Smart man not damaging his nose. The pellets may be something right for you.

I thought the pellet thing was just a way to make a lot more money for the vendor. It's far cheaper to buy powder and measure it and cap it yourself. You could buy scales, vegetable caps, and a gram for less than a bunch of pellets. Also, 25 or 50mg is not hard to weigh out with relatively high accuracy. 


I guess for some it's convenient to have them pre-measured and ready to go. Perhaps I'm just cynical.

Maybe a noncynical view is that the pellets dissolve really well when plugged making them ideal for pluging :D

Ok, got my sample, and well, what can I say, they ain't bad or anything but nothing special either. They don't dissolve easily for plugging (they do, but it's not like you put them in a small amount of water and it's dissolved), don't crush easily for snorting (again, it's doable just not extra easy), I think they hurt a bit less than straight powder (probably the binders used), oral is fine, dose seems 25mg as claimed. Appearance is kinda like the blue vendor made etizolams with a slightly different shade of blue.

Wow, the gram I received was perfect shards of ice. I would have thought it was that, if it was not for the far shorter duration than meth-amp. I weighed out 45mg, and put them in water without agitating or heating, and then sucked up about 4-5ml of water and plugged it, not all of the crystals had dissolved, so I figured it was more like 30-35mg.

After a bit more use, I have some questions, and stuff to say.


Has any one else experienced the type and duration of nausea I mentioned? Did you vomit, and what was your R.O.A.? 


I read a few people mention that when smoked it turned colors, or black or tasted odd, so I wasn't gonna try it, but my buddy suggested it - fuck me does it work well


It melts immediately into a perfectly clear puddle. So perfectly clear that it is hard to see on the foil, unless you use too much heat, then it changes to an amber hue. If done correctly (not too hot) the foil should look pretty the same as when you started as when you finished. If you didn't get this result either you have some ethylphenidate which was cut or didn't have ethylphenidate, *OR* I don't have ethylphenidate. I find the last explanation unlikely due to the duration and effects match closely with the descriptions of it's effects.


Also, the nausea only seems to occur on the very first strong hit, or any very strong dose subsequently. Smaller supplemental doses do not intensify the feeling, or bring it back. I find the nausea a bit odd, as smoked meth doesn't cause that, but then again there is not much "Blue Sky" going around (Apparently Los Pollos Hermanos got shut down?         and just if some mod is not familiar - though I find it unlikely - Los Pollos Hermanos is a fictional chicken restaurant, the front for a methamphetamine empire.). Unless you can't stand even a minute of nausea, it certainly is not a deal breaker, and I would guess that oral administration is more gradual, and therefore more subtle.


It's short duration can cause crack like redosing, but it's not *that* moreish. I binged for a bit more than 80 hours, and only noticed mild side effects, like my vision started getting a bit blurry. Even though I had taken another hit large enough to upset my stomach, I fell asleep within three hours of that hit, but I had been up a bit and took some etizolam. I was starting to feel shitty, but that's on me for not eating, and forgetting to take my loperamide for two days, the high masked the beginning symptoms of opioid W/D. I ate a roll, took some lope, and went to bed, and when I woke up I felt normal or better than normal.  


I find it preferable to meth in almost all areas- purity*****, duration (that is short enough that one dose won't keep you up for 24 hours...depending on you and the dose), price. The nausea is totally acceptable, and disappears rapidly. The only thing I can say is it isn't as euphoric as meth beats amp-salts. 


Another MAJOR side effect this stuff lacked is that the soft pallet of the roof my mouth becomes super sensitive, and the first bite of bread would be ok kinda scraping off the saliva/mucus coating, and the second would feel like I ate some brillo. Both Methamp, and Amp (adderall), (and 4 and 2fa) cause this effect. It usually takes a day or two to heal, and I have to limit what I eat to softer things which must be chewed super finely before swallowing. This amazing lacked that, although my throat felt a little sore from the roll I ate before bed, but the next day my throat felt fine. I don't know why this would lack that effect, as I smoked and swallowed it, and yet *any *ROA of the other drugs I mentioned causes this effect  to occur (dunno about intraparenteral, as it's a ROA I've never used but would assume it would as well). Can anyone elaborate on this, or share similar occurrences? 


If you find it hard to control your use when it comes to stimulants, I suggest you stay away. I find it a little difficult not to use it when I have it (unless I've been up for more than a day or so when you enter that iffy area, then sleep is desirable) and I'm not a *huge* lover of this class of drugs, though I do enjoy them every now and then. This would be the third time I've consumed a stimulant this year to give you an idea of tolerance. 


I wouldn't IV it, because I just don't shoot stuff, but if you are a fan of shooting stuff, I wouldn't. If you want a quick onset, plug it, if you want a quicker and less safe onset, smoke it. The fact that it's an RC with purity higher than street stims *might[/I1] it safer* in regard to IVing other stimulants, but stimulants are never healthy to IV anyway. I'm not talking down, I shouldn't smoke any more of it, and just plug it. 


The length of this post is also a credit to it's effects, so it might be fun to use in a social situation, unless you're prone to anxiety from stimulants or from other people. I took etizolam and still felt a bit anxious but that was probably from the heart rate increase which can cause that mild anxious feeling. I took the second 'experience' with an opiate, and I can say the side-effects are far diminished and the drug is more enjoyable. 


TL;DR - Not bad, moreish, Good>Bad by a nice extent. 


*this is assumed. Supporting evidence is I have read a discussion of a GC/MS done on the vendors product, the people concluded that it was of high purity. I say assumed because it could have very well been a different batch, or the test results falsely generated, but the GC/MS was done by someone other than the vendor. I took it with a hefty grain of something that looks like salt ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)*

#1 - Dex

#2 - Ethylphenidate

#3 - Methylphenidate 


But Ethylphenidate is so much cheaper then Dex of Methylphenidate (for me).

Today i did like 30 mg around 1:00 pm.

Good stimulation, motivation and feel good vibes.


I can't imagine that people use 500mg or more at home or something like that.

I wouldn't even use that on a rave. Such amounts fuck you up big time.

You should know testing questions aren't allowed as their usually easily found; a google search would have shown you that for most stimulants that time is rapid.

D-amp, that stuff is perfect for me. I had some 15mg extended release. 

No awkward comedown, not disconnected or anything. 

(M)etylphenidate gives you that weird feeling when the effects are gone.

I acquired a gram today, had a few small lines, it's an extremely fine powder, almost like flour. Struggling to snort it as its making me cough, hitting the back of the throat, feeling stimulated but not euphoric, a little anxious but due to it being something new. Gonna have to find a new roa. Thinking of getting a couple of beers to see if that makes it any better.

I've been using this stuff daily in two small doses. First dose like 25/30 mg and redose the same. 

Timing is very important with this stuff and i cant figure out what works best. 

Yesterday i took 35mg and went to the centre and i felt great for maybe 90 minutes. 

After that the effects became less and i start to felt shitty. I didn't want to redose because i thought it could not bring back the first high. After dinner i got 1 liter of beer and i felt good again. Not that weirdish, dont know what to do while im just staring at a wall feeling. 


Today im trying 4 doses of 15mg each two hours to see how i react on it. This stuff is pretty nice when you're using it but when the effects are gone you're left with a worthless feeling.


**PS**: i think that 90 minute high isn't worth it at all when afterwards you feel numb for 6 hours.

I'll never buy that stuff again. Either I was ripped off or it really is a shitty stim. Just gave my friend the rest of the gram bag a bought which was well over half a gram and he shot up about 150mg. Said it had an initial kick and then nothing. Personally snorting the very powdery substance I obtained was vile. Made me come each time.

I'd say the best ROA for this and MPA is via the loo ... though it would fall under animal abuse, because the sewer rats then would have to ingest those poisonous liquids.

Mine was many small rocks, and didn't feel like that at all. Maybe some vendor selling something else as eph? Who knows.

Alright, I've read through quite a large chunk of these megathreads on EPH and now have some questions before I take the plunge:


1) There's no way I'm snorting this (or pretty much anything lol).  So what is the best starting dosage orally (I have used stimulants before and have a decent, albeit not super high tolerance, so don't throw something wimpy like 15mg at me, just the standard mid-range/safe dose to get the effects.. 40mg?)


2) Rectal administration... I pretty much capsule everything, so what would the protocol here be?  Just stick the capsule as far up as you can go and bam, that's it?


3) Combining with alcohol, weed, and valium/etizolam.  From what I've gathered, low dosing on both liquor and EPH seems to be a pretty good and chill combo.  What about weed?  What about all 3 together?


4) I know people use stims like 4-FA, 2-FA, 2-FMA, etc. in combination with empathogenic drugs such as MDMA, aMT, 5-MAPB, 6APDB, BK-2C-B, etc. to make a little designer chem cocktail.  Any EPH experiences here, with MDMA and aMT in particular?  Or more specifically, what would be the safest low-dose combo?  Anything to stay away from especially?


5)  Viagra, etc... no problem to pop one on the comedown?

need to dissolve it into water, you can't plug capsules "dry" and expect it to work.


oral dosage is probably around 30-50mg. combination with alcohol/benzos is probably nicer than with cannabis because some people are real susceptible to anxiety from that.


it's probably not worth it to combine eph and psychedelics/other stims. just increases the incidence of side effects. viagra is ok though.

My prefered means of taking ethylphenidate is rectal. I measure out 40mgs to 55mgs,mix in one ml of water and stir it until it dissolves. 

Then I suck it up into a needleless rig and plug away. I find that this method gives me the most bang for my buck. If I took an oral dose it would have to be 2 or 3 times larger to get a good effect(for me any way). Even then it`s too subtle for me.

Did the same thing when I received it. CVS will give you a 1 ml oral syringe (it's bright orange) if you just ask, other pharmacies probably will too if you're nice about it. 


I weighed out about 45 mgs, and sucked it up when only 60-70% had dissolved and holy shit, by the time I got outside to smoke a cigarette it hit at once. The rush of euphoria was so intense I almost puked right then and there, but I held on and it vanished into a wave of stimulated euphoria. I didn't even smoke the cigarette all the way - it kept going out. I didn't try it at all orally, but smoking it was particularly fiendish and it's purity led to almost no residue on foil. I was impressed and would probably choose this stuff over methamphetamine.

Hi there,

Sorry to butt in,but I am trying to find out stuff and going round in circles not quite getting anywhere,so I thought I would be brave and ask!

I have been taking ethylphenidate now for 24 days and know I'm building tolerance fast by the amount I am doing(over 500mg per day) and the effects,or rather lack of,but it is helping me get up in the morning,it has got rid of the horrible lethargy cannot be bothered to do anything that is not necessary feeling I have been having.


I'm just over 40,married with 2 teenage kids,and now thanks to complications developed when an alcoholic,disabled,mentally and physicaly.I haven't had a drink for nearly 3 years now though.I have no friends,either on line or in person,a Hubby who is now,thanks to his own medical problems,a depressed PS3 addict who is trying to block out the shitty life we have to endure every day.I cannot go out on my own,in fact I hate going out,I do everything too slow for even my own liking and try to blot out the perpetual pain that is always,always,ready to remind me what I shitty fuck up I am with various prescribed painkillers.Depressed?ever so slightly,but no one gives a crap.Thanks to having major surgery on my ankle,I live upstairs,venturing down to cook every now and again,Hubby lives,sleeps,eats and breathes 99% of the time downstairs.It never used to be like this and I wish for those days again.I think that is enough of the picture for you to get the idea,I'm trying to show you.


Anyway,bored out of my skull,I was watching old programmes when one about 'legal highs' from a few years ago was on,and as I have used speed in the past it got my attention.I had a look on line,found out a bit more,discovered RC's and ordered some.I wasn't expecting much,but was feeling reckless.Or just plain stupid.I am not too sure yet.![:?](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/confused.gif)


My first little weeny 500mg lot arrived.WOW!!! was I surprised.It was just like the speed of old days!OK,it stung a lot,but fuck me!!There where tingles in my head,I felt awake,ALIVE!I was resurrected!!So I ordered more......then again a few days later(just quality control)..and again(its the weekend soon).....then again(I deserve a treat) then...you guessed it..AGAIN (last one for a bit) and so my old friend addiction was back.I was justifying it to myself 100%.No one suspected anything,Hubby keeps odd hours anyway with his gaming,the kids are either out or asleep before me and I am normally just quiet anyway.I was never asleep before 4 am,or up before 10am,Hubby getting up even as late as 3pm if he has had yet another night of shit sleep,despite us both popping a Zolpiderm at night.I was able to blend in,and still am.No one knows...except you guys and my laptop.


So I did the stupid thing and bought in bulk.I could ration myself to about 500mg a day,split into 4 or 5,I said.It is so cheap I would be silly not to,I said.I am in control,I said.Then I saw three pigs fly past my window,if you get what I mean.


Now I see myself as in trouble,in the last few days I have noticed my intake of EPH up,weight down(well I could afford to lose a little)appetite non existent and rationing going up and up.So maybe I should now think about damage limitation.

I do sleep about5/6 hours every night,eat breakfast every day,and glug fruit smoothies through the rest of the time even if I don't drink as much water as I was.I am happy about my weight loss,I was trying to lose weight,but thanks to a love of night time snacking on the usual crisps,sweets and chocolate biscuits, I was not.Now I have a draw full of untouched snacks.I have learnt not to try and put it up my nose,the pain was out weighing the pleasure,even though the initial hit is sorely missed,and I can only 'have a bad cold' for so long.Besides,it is easier and safer to share some out and swallow it instead of mirrors and whatnot.


So to finally.. (I am sorry that went on for so long,but I wanted to fill you in.And imagine how long it took me to type,I am a slow typist even now!)Questions!


1.Are there any vitamins or supplements recommended for either enhancing or making the comedown less painful?I have seen a little about something called 5-HTP,and it seems like it either helps or you see no difference.Anyone taken/taking it with good effect?I am currently taking thiamine,calcium,cod liver oil and a multivitamin,and just ordered some vitamin B complex,glutamine and magnesium with the weekly shop.Any thoughts would be great to hear.


2.Sertraline,does it help or hinder the effects of EPH when I was already taking it.I was in the process of cutting down,without telling my Dr,from 50mg to 25mg.Some days I would forget to take it,so I don't think I was that dependant on it,but have been taking it on and off for about 10 years.I know it takes longer than that to do its work,but my mood was fairly stable.


3.Sub lingual protection.Last week,I stuck to my ration for once,and put it down to taking it this way....but then the blisters appeared and I had bit of my mouth coming away every time I tried to speak and have been eating Bonjela like a demon.It is just too sore.Is there anything that can be done to help prevent this happening cos I think the effect otherwise was good.At the moment I just stick it on my tongue and swallow,quite enjoying the sweet,sweet taste of chemicals.Ever since my first encounter with speed,anything remotely chemical is fine by me.


4.Does anyone know if there are any interactions with the following that I should be aware of?Pregabalin,codeine,slow release dihydrocideine,naproxen,omeprazole and zolpiderm.I take all but Naproxen every day,and that only every so often for a week or so.


I am so sorry to of babbled on for so long,but felt to get anywhere you had to know the basics of me.I do know I am being stupid,I should never of got the first lot,and should of known that I could not control it as well as I thought I could.

But I feel alive again.

I have finished projects that where started years ago,silly thing like gave myself a proper manicure,without skipping bits,I pay more attention to detail.Also I am better at crosswords.I'm not dreading waking up as I was,or getting so depressed when Hubby is so into whatever he is doing he doesn't speak to me for hours/ignores me/doesn't hug me when he says goodnight.I have brilliant chats with my son (who constantly looks in a state of stimulants,but I know 110% he is not)and am listening to my daughters world of her,her,and oh her when she wants to.I smoke less (hands too busy)take less painkillers because I get so wrapped up in,say,crosswords I forget they have eased off,it's only when I go to stand up again,and wonder why it hurts so much that I realise that I should of taken them an hour ago.And lets just say I might of taken one or two more than I should of at least....8 times a day.

I know it cannot last,and things will go back to how they where,probably worse,but for now I am,I suppose compared to how I felt before meeting EPH....content!And I cannot remember when I last felt that![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png).


So for now,if anyone has any answers to the above,or can point me in the right direction it would be great,thanks.

I'm guessing that post was written while being on eph?


As for your questions:


1) I know you don't want to hear it, but quitting for a few months and sticking to occasional use and sane doses is your best bet. Benzos help with stimulant comedowns too, but that's a short term solution and with all the other meds you're taking could be dangerous (opiates, pregabalin, zolpidem and benzos potentiate each other) depending on your tolerance, exact doses, ...


2) No idea, sorry.


3) Put it in gel caps or plugg it.


4) You mean between the eph and stuff you listed or stuff you listed with eachother?

Hmmmmm What on earth makes you think that?![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)ME????


Thanks for answering,yep,for no.4 I meant with each other.

I will carry on digging round,this site is amazing for just reading about what other people are experiencing,as expected I keep getting distracted by threads,and forget what I was looking for in the first place.This eph would be good for people who have to write a lot,I have never had the urge to write this much before.If you think that post was long,you should see my 'I think I should write about this'notebook![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif)


If I had had the energy to write something that long before taking eph,I probably would not of touched it.As it was,today when the shopping was delivered it took me and my son 5 hours to put it away,done that,then all the other house crap like washing,sorting,drying clothes,getting meals ready,dishes,cleaning.....and so on.Hubby just brought his plates out after eating....that was it....the rest of the time with his PS3.![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)I miss him.I want MY Hubby back.![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)And I don't know how.


The Dr said there was nothing he could do without talking to him,so maybe I will use this time to try and find some advice for helping him maybe...very sensitive issues,so another thing I don't want him to find out.


I will keep my eye on here though,I think this is a really interesting place and I'm so glad I found it,and I promise,no more epic posts![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif).

The Dark Side is more appropriate for discussion about your interpersonal relationships. 


This thread is about if you are going to get high on EPH, then how to use it as safely as possible.

Yeah,sorry,it just sort of gets me like that sometimes.![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)


OK,back to one of my original questions,the sub lingual method.Either I have some super strong eph,or disgustingly delicate oral features cos I have,from one day of taking only 4 lots of my new favourite pass time last week,had burns in my mouth that have had bits of skin falling off like I have never seen before,and I was once a dental nurse.At first I thought they where the usual type of ulcers that occur every now and again,but then I felt something in my mouth and saw a piece of skin about 2cm long.Eeewwww!!!So of course I had another look,and it was not a pretty sight.

Wherever the eph had been for longer than a nano second was damaged.


Now I am not completely new to chemicals,one way or another,and have never had anything like this happen.Nor seen/heard about stuff like this.So why pick on me?? A week later and I still have to watch what I eat,like if anyone dares to offer me a crisp...Razorblades would be kinder I kid you not.These things are mean!Somehow I don't think shop sold me their 'burn your gob off special strong stuff',so I assume its me.


Has anyone else come across this?Or does anyone have an idea as to what I can do? (but I think I already got that answer.Sweet F.A. Do it another way!)


Never knew I was so fragile![8o](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eek.gif)

The caustic nature of ethylphenidate is well documented throughout this thread. There have been methods to ease insufflation and mouth pain. Plugging is also an option, but it's still very caustic, and I'd advise against using too much too often, which was my problem with ethylphenidate. I couldn't moderate. I've been tempted to go back, very nearly have a few times -- I think it'll get ya if you aren't careful.

Indeed. 


Take it orally dissolved in water, or parachute it - I personally plug it.

Just got a new order which is shit. Looks similar with way larger rocks. It burns into something nasty when vaporized. 


40mg of the other stuff had me spun.....400mg had me spun for 6 days.  I barely feel this shit at like 800mg+


The vendor acknowledged it was a lousy batch and was getting a different one next week so he should hook me up.

I hope things get sorted,lolwhatzdrugs ,rotten luck.

I wonder if it could be the same as mine,Vendor I mean,or from the same lot.I thought it was odd,in the space of 1 day,to have to double my doses,I mean,yes,I know about building tolerance,physical factors,even your mood before can change the way drugs do their thing,but overnight!!!


BUT....with me,in this instance,I think it might be a good thing.

Maybe the difference between giving myself god knows what in the mouth,prolonged,irritated ulcers cannot be good,in the quest to achieve last weeks manic cleaning,OR just try and accept I told myself you don't get something as cheap as chips for no good reason.(and it was cheap)

Honestly,I was amazed the postman turned up with anything!


I am trying the nasal decongestant bottle filled with water and eph,both carefully measured of course,and it is a nifty little cheat,specially if you have to go somewhere.Portable,discreet,easily administrated,what more can you ask for?


It's for those reasons I am not a fan of plugging,and as I am trying to keep this as quiet as I can,I don't want to push my luck by hogging the loo for too long.Also I want to get on my self imposed 'show ME I can cut down cos no one else in this house cares about me' routine,which involves sticking to a set amount,about 5 x 75mg bundles of happiness,a day for now,just with the remainder staying put!! (for a LONG while) cutting the size of them every few days,then back to Boringville.Bit of a challenge,but I think I am in the right frame of mind.![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

I can only offer my insights into ethylphenidate as am alternative to crystal for sex. Overall verdict-keep looking. Snorting tears your nose to shreds and produces blood-streaked yellow snot (LOTS of it). Oral nothing. Plugging (or bumping as we gays like to term it) OK if you use 500mg or so but slow to build and nothing like bumping crystal. Slamming now you're talking- about 0.2-0.5 ml (of powder of course into a 1 ml syringe) Make SURE it's dissolved and it's a great hit and horny. BUT (and there's always a downside) I have big veins and slam myself easily. But this produces much worse injection site reactions than crystal and really collapses veins. There's something about this chemical your veins really don't like. I came to me senses before doing too much harm but you could wake up on Monday morning in a real mess.  AND don't let anyone tell you the come down's worse than crystal. It's AT least as bad.

Daymn this stuff is so caustic, i already knew that but fuck didnt expect it to be this bad!!! Nose hurts, blowing out blood, sinus hurts at the back of my throat, glands on the right hand side of my neck hurt, maybe the cold i may or may not have is contributing, but the cold symptoms started the day after first snorting it, kinda figured the mucous build up was from the ethylphenidate? 


How much is too much with this stuff? Ive been going for 12 hours, done no more than 200mg over those hours but have combined it with GBL, Etizolam & a few drinks, im fairly certain without the GABA drugs id have been feeling like death hours ago & knocked my self out with some Quetiapine. But yeahhh makes it a bit hard to judge if im approaching dangerous territory as i have a decent amount of etizolam flowing around.... Think i will call it quits for the night but yeah would like to know a rough estimate of whats "safe" as ive seen people talk about taking 200mg at once & crazy shit like that, so ima bit confused.

200mg in 12h should be fine. Now obviously if you feel like shit, don't take any more, but I don't think you're in any danger yet. Still, are you sure it was only 200mg? EPH is caustic but not that much, snorting 200mg in 12h shouldn't screw up your nose that bad.


What's safe depends on tolerance, those that use it more often become tolerant and can take much more than you did in 12h and feel fine. Oh, and do a favor to your nose and either use oral or plugging.

If you're on a dose that you need gabagerics or you feel things would go south without them, YOU ARE DOING IT WRONG. Those are first-line drugs for stimulant overdose.... that you perceive this danger and are pushing it that far should tell you that you're not in a safe place.


40mg had me blown for 8 hours, the euphoria hit so hard I almost puked my guts out but it slowly went away. I didn't push it much further. As for it being caustic, rectally dosing heavily diluted in water didn't seem too bad - from what I read and the looks of it (like rock salt) I wasn't about to snort that shit, if rectally it had caused ANY discomfort it would have been done entirely orally. 


Why stick stuff up your nose, especially stims, when there are other less acutely/chronically irritating ROAs with high bioavailability?

I'm not getting any responses there. Perhaps I should have asked all that here to begin with. In a nutshell, as of 2014, how likely am I to receive an order of ethylphenidate shipped from the UK to the US? Have things changed significantly enough that I should instead my order to be intercepted?

You're in the US? "Wikipedia says: Legal status	Unscheduled (US) (UK)" which is accurate. 


So I would guess close to 100%, but you never know if they'll really know what it is, know you probably shouldn't have it and throw it away though it isn't illegal to order or possess, unless it is in individual dosage units/marked for human consumption.  If you're ordering a whole lot, I'd test the waters and order a tiny bit and see, though there's not much of a reason why they should stop it. 


There are people supplying it in the United States, but as you know, you'll have to find all that stuff yourself as it's not allowed. Just preemptively mentioning it because I can see the question moving in that direction as you have 7 posts - Welcome to Bluelight where the light is blue, and get high too!


To sum it up:


a few grams of a non-scheduled substance, clearly marked with a professional looking label and not marked for human consumption or individual dosage units (better, marked 'not for human consumption'), and not with paraphernalia and you're fine, if it is taken you will not be prosecuted as it is an unscheduled substance. I however just avoid the hassle and forget about customs.... domestic from a known supplier or fuck it.  Now get it pressed in pills with little dolphins and colored and you're going to jail. Since no one with a brain will sell it to you in the latter form, you're fairly safe. Even without the label I mentioned (as long as it isn't marked for human consumption, tons of 40-50 mg bags anything that says "I'm an individual dosage unit," or anything which implies "I'm supposed to be consumed"), even with crummy packaging, even from a place with no return address, if they seize it you're not risking arrest for a few grams of this, probably even for a whole lot. I don't think there are any convictions just for someone ordering an analogue in bulk internationally


From your other posts, it is smart to stay away from anyone who's site, or communications or anything of that sort implies that it is to be consumed. Trip reports, dosage, anything more than straight up analytical reports from NMR/GC-MS is a warning sign that says go elsewhere.

Thanks, that's a surprisingly comforting answer. I know not to ask around for vendors here. Most of the ones that I've found in the states have scam written all over them or are just begging for the DEA to get involved. Besides, I don't think I'd pass the word along about a good vendor once I found one for everyone to see. Considering the nature of the business, it's probably a good sign if a vendor has limited publicity.

200mg in 12 hours should be fine. im on about 250mg 11 hours in as is. feel a little big cagey, a pyrazolam wouldn't go a miss. Kinda anxious, dry mouth, jaw jiggles - but I'm nowhere near danger level. And I'm not exactly a big guy.

As I said, I always snort - this is because I know oral bioavailability is far lower. However, I was wondering if anyone happened to know an approximate bioavailability for the various methods of administration. The ones I'm interested in most are insufflation, sublingual, oral and smoking (no idea if all of these would even work at all) but I'd also be interested to know the bioavailabilities of plugging, IVing and IMing, even though I'll never do these (except perhaps plugging), and any other RoAs you guys can think of.

I've no percentage numbers here specifically for ethylphenidate, except the Ki values for the dextro isomer and the racemate. But with most drugs it generally works like this, with the highest on the list tending to be the highest bioavailablity and/or speed of onset:


IV (99%+)

Smoking/Vaprozation (can be up to 95% as available depending on equipment and skill - possibly slightly higher. almost as fast as IV in most cases. It was almost never be faster.)

Rectal (90%+, slower onset than IV &/ Smoke-vape)

IM (?? % probably depends alot on the solubility. Could be faster or slower onset than rectal again depending on the drug)

Snorted (?? % again solubility here. Then theres if those anterior nares get stuffed etc etc... lower than all of the above, but faster onset than rectal & possibly IM)

Oral (?? % lots of factors at play here. Probably the slowest onset of them).


I havent touched on SC or sublingual.

First time trying this stuff it felt kind a like a slightly less euphoric and cleaner (way less noradrenaline effect) version of speed (amp sulphate).


Now when it I take it (rectally) I get rarely any euphoria and mainly anxiety. I always get anxiety from stim comedowns (I have anxiety disorder) but not usually from the main high. I'll try not taking it for a week and then try again, overall it's mediocre as hell, not to mention you can't snort it (or at least shouldn't be if you don't want your nose to fall off).

^I have come across two batches of the d isomer that even in large amounts were surprisingly easy on the nose, that being said it is still a poor RoA as it causes compulsive redosing(not that you all didn't already know that). My least favorite thing about this one is that it causes me to ramble in every thread I open![:p](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png). Has anyone used small oral doses as an effective study aid?

Was this confirmed by an independent lab to be pure d-threo-eph or just stated by the vendor? Because even all racemic eph doesn't have the same causticity.

Yes, and it works. Don't have time for details, if you don't find them I'll explain tonight.

I found that all it did in any reasonable dose was promote wakefulness, very unlike methylphenidate in that regard.

I should have clarified, a reasonable dose for studying. I have snorted some decent sized line, toothpick sized. I recently allowed some on who likes cocaine to try some and I was worried they might have a heart attack, he made lines the length or 1.5 credit cards and about 4-5mm thick! He didn't get a heart attack I just thought those were insanely large lines, and he did a few of them. Just so no one gets the wrong idea I do have a very accurate scale which I use for more potent things.

It was stated by a vendor who is known for discontinuing/turning down alot of popular products over the slightest impurities. I've also had a sample of racemic eph from another source that produced noticeably different effects.

This stuff isn't amazing but currently i'm not at uni or in a job atm so can't stop taking it to help the godawful boredom. Will try my best not not to order any more when I run out (I've been a benzo addict for years, don't want any more addictions).


With alcohol it's quite nice, reduces the anxiety. I find now i have to redose every hour and a half or the anxious comedown starts to kick in.

It wouldn't surprise me if this caused or exacerbated psychosis.

Hmm, same typical nonsense from the newsrag lying about drugs (speed is class b and pretty much the same price/cheaper than EPH and more euphoric imo)


>“like heroin and ecstasy combined”.


I fucking wish 8)


Corner shops and head shops shouldn't be selling this stuff because this is what happens, morons buy some shit take the whole pack and die (I don't know?). And wtf is "burst", maybe it was labeled this way or the newsrags making up new silly names for drugs nobody ever uses....

I tried EPH for the first time recently, and was disapointed. Tried it orally and IV, the only bit of euphoria was produced ,in my first couple hits. Oral doses of 25-50 mg, and IV doses ranging from 10-75 mg, all were reliably weak for me. Even after giving several hours in between redose, each hit seemed weak. Also, started to vape in a bubble, and the nasty sweet taste dissuaded me instantly.


I think there was too much norepinephrine activity for my liking. Just generally caused typical annoying stimulant side effects like sweatiness, anxiety, and vasoconstriction without any of the positive effects. 


Read someone said there's just a feeling of general malaise, and I would have to agree. One upside is that, there were no very serious concerning side effects, and even after a bit of excessive use, there was no obscene paranoia.

I get very euphoric from Ethylphenidate, but I agree that it's MUCH cleaner than any other stims I've done before. I would compare the euphoria to that which I get from Adderall, only without the twitching and sweating. 


I also take Metoprolol for chronic tachycardia, which I developed when I was 25 after a 5 month IV Foxy binge. Doctors have no idea whatsoever why this would of happened, but for the last 13 years, my sober, resting pulse without a Beta-Blocker is consistently around 140bpm. However, I've had every medical test known done to me, and none of them show anything wrong with my heart. My point in telling about this is that Metoprolol is an NE antagonist, so even when I take Methylphenidate I don't get a whole lot of physical stimulation symptoms, just the euphoria pretty much, so my perception of the effects of stims probably doesn't apply to many other people. 


That being said, Ethylphenidate, which I just tried for the first time last week, is by far my new favorite stimulant! This is because not only do I find it extremely blissful, but I haven't run into any unpleasant side effects except minor, transient nausea, and I can actually fall asleep roughly 6 hours after my last dose, which I find impossible to do for quite a long time after the effects of other stims wear off. 


If you get overwhelmed with anxiety on the come down and don't have benzos handy, try Valerian extract. It works just as well as benzos for anxiety and insomnia without causing intoxication, memory loss, or hangovers. Namaste!

Ethylphenidate definetly can quickly caused stim psychosis.  I am an addict in the sense that I use any drug I have till it's gone and when I order a gram of this stuff and binge it in a day and don't sleep that night I already get audio hallucinations and visual blurriness and I literally see shit moving like I'm tripping on a psych.  Usually this is after 5+ mgs etizolam to curb anxiety or half a litre or more of vodka, used for the same reason.


I've experienced these symptoms on multiple occasions and only ever with this drug.  Not with half a ball coke nights, not with snorting 2 points of pure crystal meth shards with little to no tolerance within 30 min nights (no amph tolerance, just other stim tolerance) and not with my adderall experience or even my 1g+ experiences with crystal molly that later tested to be methylone (duh, 1g of real mdma wud completely fuck me up, potentially for monthS). Thank god I got a test kit.


But anyways, my point is this shit is very compulsive to redose and is the only stim ever to give me psychosis where I get visual and audio hallucinations.

Given that it's a pretty potent NDRI... i'm not suprised that it causes psychosis in overdose, or when  you use it for 3 days w/o sleeping.

It looks like most people here use nasal dosing, or ROA's other than oral; when it comes to snorting it, that's out of the question for me.


So my question is, do any of y'all get any worthwhile effects out of orally dosing EPH, or is it a complete waste of time and material? Oral is the only ROA I'm willing to try with this substance, so if it's pointless I plan to avoid it all together.

I do get good effects orally. I generally mix 15mg ethylphenidate with 80mg caffeine and 6mg sunifiram in a capsule to good results--increased motivation, alertness, mood lift. It's not super dramatic at this dosage--but I don't think it's worth the come down when you take stronger doses. 


Note that the comedown, for me, consists mostly of incredible boredom, amotivation, and tiredness, maybe some irritability. Not depression or anything. Just unpleasant if you've still got work to do.

^That's good to hear. I've had several grams laying around but I rarely touch the stuff as insufflation always leads to recreational binges, I've been curious about oral use for awhile now. I think I will eat a 30 mg rock before taking an ACT practice test tomorrow.

I think you should expect good results, depending on your stimulant tolerance. Afaik 30mg ethylphenidate is roughly equivalent to 15mg ritalin, although in my experience it's a bit more "buzzy" and less conducive to true productive focus. Still worthwhile IMO if you can control your dosage and stay under the amount that will start distracting you. 


Tbh I don't know how people take ethylphenidate recreationally. It starts to give me chest tightness, heart pains, and vasoconstriction even from ~30-50mg oral. And the comedown seems exponentially worse with every dosage increase. Just doesn't seem worth it for fun unless you're planning on immediately knocking yourself out at the end of the night with benzos to sleep through the comedown. 


Another thing to keep in mind is that ethylphenidate is extremely short acting... You might start coming down before you finish your test! I've actually taken to dissolving a small quantity in a beverage and sipping at it while working. Keeps me at an even level, rather than shooting up and down and switching from hyper focus to no focus.

Very clever!! A few months ago I was reading up on how to make your own time release pills.  Drinking measured quanities of a drink laced with eph seems like a much more simple/effective way to go about things.

Gotta say my first trial with this was a little disappointing. I wasn't quite sure what to expect based on the mixed reviews here but figured I would research it since I loved drinking and railing 20mg of Ritalin a few years ago. I started with some Four Loko (don't hate! haha) and 20mg EPH insullfated over 30 min to test the waters and then redosed a couple more times within the next two hours. I did take 10mg of Valium early on to try and help with the uncomfortable part of the high. Not much euphoria was felt but it was a little reminiscent of Ritalin, just not nearly as rushy or speedy feeling. It made my heart beat fast and also before I would start talking, it felt like I had to take a deep breath before I could get my words out...


The comedown was god awful, I was jittery, anxious, and was only able to get a few hours of sleep. The anxiety during this comedown led to a feeling of complete despair and hopelessness and it lasted for a good portion of the next day. My last dose was around 9pm the night before.


Due to the terrible comedown (greater or equal to a Ritalin comedown) I am hesitant to test this again, although I do want to research it at higher initial dosing. I feel like adding a little more alcohol/or benzo into the mix would help ease the anxiety much more. 


Lastly, I'd like to add that my muscles became very tense and during the comedown and through the next day. Not a great feeling...

If you people are shooting or snorting this stuff you're getting high wrong. Or at the very least, badly (if you're shooting it, then stupidly dangerously).


40mg plugged of the most pure looking crystal shit I've ever seen was like the most crazy DNRI experience I've had. Fuck all the pyrovalerone derivatives, this stuff for me is like shorter acting meth with a bit less of the euphoric kick. Just plug it or swallow it. I will say I got a bunk batch that not even 100's of mg did shit, but the first stuff I had 40 mg was fucking intense. I was smoking a cigarette and just sat there and it burnt out. 


I could understand you having a terrible experience if anyone received the same stuff as I got in the second batch, it's supposed to be replaced real soon with different stuff, so time will tell.

Just a warning, I suffer from acid reflux and orally dosing ethylphenidate daily over the course of a week gave me esophagitis (inflammation of the esophagus). So don't presume just because you can't see any damage with your ROA that it isn't actually doing any damage!

50mg doses two times a day swallowed in paper for a week. The muscle between my esophagus and stomach doesn't work so well so I have always had a lot of stomach acid flowing back up, but imagine a mixture of stomach acid and caustic ethylphenidate freely washing up and down my esophagus. I would suspect that if I continued this dosing it would have harmed my stomach lining too, probably lucky I didn't.

It is probably a crazy caustic chemical and is probably safer orally than rectally, it probably flows like this in the amount of harm reduction (oral>rectal>smoked>iv). 


It's definitely orally active, so it's the safest, and your stomach is used to dealing with some pretty corrosive stuff, but rectally it didn't seem to be a problem. If you're snorting it though, I bet it hurts like fuck and will quickly deviate your septum.

To people who are having trouble vaporizing ethylphenidate that sucks now gtfo.  haha just kidding I have a solution.  Heat the EPH at hot and quick as possible (get the lighter like right below the bulb) and don't inhale.  fill the chamber then stop applying heat for like 10 or 15 seconds.  now inhale.  not so bad now is it?


edit: the point of heating it very fast is to get it bubbling and producing vapor BEFORE it starts burning to much.  unfortunately the salt form of EPH burns at lower temp than it boils so heating it slowly will give you burnt product that wasnt hot enough to vape, it just burned.  You need to get it fucking smoking hard so you get vapor going before it gets too charred and not smokable. that made sense right?

well i fucked up. went on a binge from a 2g bag :S  fucked up; ended up using like 10x more the dose i wanted to do haha shit. 


not so bad, no idea how much i did. maybe 500ish mg maybe more?    i find it very nice, almost like a mix between meth and ritalin. urge to re dose isn;t as bad as coke or mdpv imo, because with Ethylphenidate you comedown so slow, i dont even know when it started.  come-down is way more like meth (and sometimes the high can feel similar but way different. clean, but i can tell why ppl hate the feeling tbh. i don't mid it.


snorting is best roa imo, but def the most dangerous. so will have to oral from now on. and low oral doses i could imagine being really good for work, etc. 


i don't mind this comedown like i dont mind meth comedown, if dose is low. i hate ritalin comedown more than this.


i can;t really comment because i had other drugs left in system when i did this.. phenibut, and flubromazepam.  so i cant really comment at all. i will edit my post once i get more experiance with this drug.


i could imagine this being bad for plugging..  lolwhatzdrugs posted heaps of good info (TY).  plugging didnt give me a rush, strange.. snorting did however.. rush is very fucking nice, but lasted like 2 or 3 mins.  high aafter can be said it is nice n euphoric. chill , though i think ill have a better experiance when i get another set of scales and no other drugs in system.


how the fuck do yous smoke it? most horrible liquish/plastic taste ever.  i never got it to vape right, it is an art...   whynaught are you talking about using a bulb for vaping? good post btw, but it sounds so easy but takes much practise sometimes. i think oral doses of 25mg to 50mg are best to use.


i think we are hearing so many problems about the super-bad comedowns is because people use too much. simple. inclduing me hah.   less is more with stimulants. 


like someone would go out and do fucking 250mg of ritalin would you?  this Ethylphenidate feels stronger, and wayyyyy more euhoric than ritalin. 


sorry for going on, i should not be posting right now ay.  no sleep etc init.


never thought i would see something that is probaly 5 or 10x worse to snort than 2cb... not even making that up.  though th ethylphenidate burn goes away super fast, but so fucking stong it can knock u out first time when u dont expect it.(feels like it lol)  i think more ppl are going to end up going to the hospital for nose problems if ppl snort this shit

I think I've become dependant on EPH from taking it nearly everyday, I don't get much euphoria at all now unsurprisingly. I get anxiety without it which my diclazepam won't touch (too big tolerance, not taking shit tonnes just to raise it higher), only kratom calms down the anxiety significantly but kratom is so short lasting.


I've always been a downer guy and addicted to benzos for years, I knew the "stimulants don't cause physical withdrawal" was bullshit but didn't realise withdrawal from stims includes anxiety ![:|](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eyesclosed.gif), it seems like everything on the planet gives me anxiety  ![:?](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/confused.gif)

EPH isn't that potent compared to Ritalin at blocking the noradrenaline transporter. And I've not taken a huge amount of stims but racemix ampthetamine sulphate seems to have a larger effect of noradrenaline.


I've never had had drug induced psychosis thankfully, but have had non-drug induced psychosis that lasted like 10 hours before i realised that the voices coming out the air vents weren't real and that my room wasn't bugged....

I only got psychosis because i was living with strangers which i hated, i'm a very paranoid person and don't really trust anybody. i don't think i could even share a house with a friend without becoming suspicious of their "agenda". The only people I can live with really are with my mum and sister or around my dad's apartment. i don't get the paranoia from them because i've lived with them pretty much my whole life.


i know taking stimulants is a bad idea, but all drug addiction is.

No, you experienced psychosis because you were abusing psychostimulants (unless you weren't... then you *really* don't need to be messing with stimulants). 


That you think you got them 'only' because of where you were living is probably merely because that's where you experienced the psychosis, so it biased your psychosis and/or your perception of it or how it works. It sounds like you're already a paranoid person.

It isn't so black and white. There are drugs which are worse for *some* people to use, and drugs that are worse for *all* people. Getting drunk every day is objectively worse than smoking weed every day. One is hepatotoxic, the other isn't - not that you should do either everyday, or at all.


If you're already a paranoid person who has already experienced psychosis (either with or without stimulants), then increasing your dopamine levels with stimulants, or really anything that releases dopamine into synapses/increases synaptic dopamine levels/decreases the levels or action of DAT (which removes dopamine from the synapses),  is going to be a bad idea. 


If you're going to do it, go slow (with the size of the doses, and the intervals between doses), try not to stay up more than a day at a time, if you do then definitely NOT 2 days, force yourself to eat (EPH doesn't really kill my appetite, this is pretty unique among stimulants for me) and stay hydrated - follow these tips for the most harm reduction.


Really, lower and less frequent doses and not staying up for days are the most effective two things for keeping you sane and physically healthy.

Then it goes for you it goes 10,000x more to be careful with stimulants or other drugs that, as I said: "releases dopamine into synapses/increases synaptic dopamine levels/decreases the levels or action of DAT (which removes dopamine from the synapses." 


Dopamine isn't definitively linked to all psychotic disorders, but it's closely enough linked that we know that drugs that agonize it's receptors or increase it's concentrations cause or increase behavioral effects which sure look psychotic and/or deluded/paranoid, and dopamine antagonists (things that in general do the opposite to the quoted stuff) seem to help remove psychoses and delusions. 


If you have already had troubles with delusions or paranoia then psychostimulants can and will (if not abstained from or treated extremely carefully) only make things worse. 


No one ever did a stimulant while paranoid about '*them*' doing '*something*' to them, and had it go away or get better. 


I don't mean to preach at you, I just want you to be careful

I can't believe all the complaints about insufflation, yet it still seems to be the most common roa.


I will be getting some this week and will probably use it rectally, or IV depending how I react. Im thinking of having 1-2 drinks before I administer 25mg. After the allergy test ofcourse.


The only stimulants ive used is Meth. Could someone ethylphenidates pro sexual effects? Ive heard good thimgs about NDRI's when it comes to sex.

Please don't IV it, it's still a research chemical, and if it wasn't it would be like Ritalin in pill form, and it would still be stupid to IV. If you must IV it DO NOT do it without a low micron wheel filter and bacteriostatic water. But really, just don't IV it. Plugging it has a SUPER NICE rush, it hits hard enough that the euphoria can make you a bit sick. IVing it will probably pack that 2-5 minute rushy feeling into 20 seconds, but it's not really worth it. Again, please don't IV it, it's a research chemical, and also a pretty decently strong vasoconstrictor, those things are not very kind to your veins. You should be kind to your veins. 


I'm sure it probably has good sexual effects, never tried it like that so I dunno. It's certainly not as sexual feeling as some of the MDPV analogues I've tried. You might have a hard time getting an erection.

No surprise that you know what's up! ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) Everyone should try it plugged, it's really the safest way (except oral) with a faster come up. I don't like LONG drawn out highs, so it also trades duration for a instant kick and a bit of a rush. Best ROA IMO, smoking it is fast, but it can't be good for you.

If what you have is EPH (ethyl^) it perfectly dissolves in water, and is HIGHLY highly soluble. I could probably dissolve 40-60 mg in less than .3 ml.

Well instead of waiting untill the weekend i justified some small doses with friends. Which quickly turned to fiending. I insufflated all my doses, took 2 hours of small doses to build up passed the stimulation leading to a very euphoric high lasting 30 minutes followed by more stimulation. I see Ethylphenidate having huge potential as a tool but not as a recreational drug (unless IVed?). I hope to quit stimulants for a long time.

Been IM. (intramuscular injection) of ethylphenidate for nearly a year now I have IV. It smoked it on rizla intranasely taken it Evan rectaly the most I have ever IM. Is 1.5g in one shot most I have ever IV. Is 0.5g IV. Is odd it feels like glass rattling up your veins but the rush is worth it if you can find a vain that is I am addicted to the stuff I get through anywhere between 2-15g a week I counter the lack of sleep with my prescription medication 600mg of MR. quetiapine a day 15mg of haloperidol 30mg of mirtazapine and 600 mg 3 times a day of gaberpentin. Peace ethyl junkie

IM ethylphenidate is the way to go though I find it's the best and least damaging way to take the drug that's if you use clean fresh works that is and follow safe injecting practices which I sometimes don't do. The way I see it is sniffing it burns the hell out of your nose and gives you mouth ulcers to boot loads a tiny ones on your tongue and shit. Smoking it fucks your lungs IV. Burns the hell out of you'd chains (but is very fun ;-) rectaly taking it isn't that effective. IM is the way forward in my eyes.

Psychotropic87:


1. You can post all of that in a single post.

2. This is a harm reduction form - see 3.

3. IM is most certainly **not **the least dangerous way to take this drug, taking it orally is the least dangerous way, followed by probably rectal which is close in danger to nasally. IM and IV are the least safe ways to take this drug, and the least safe ways to take *any* drug, especially drugs in the research chemical class.


If you're IV/IMing RCs without bacteriostatic water, and 2 micrometer microfilters you're directly putting yourself at risk of embolism (if IVing), or all other kinds of nasty stuff - abscesses and the whole range of IV/IM complications. Even with those steps there is no guarantee that what you have is free of toxic, water soluble impurities (though it's unlikely, it very well could happen).

i used it with alcohol most of the time. at the weekend (friday/saturday night) i go to the club i frequent at 1:00-1:30 am, drink 50cl vodka in strong cocktails in like 1-1,5 hour, then i start to dose EPH when i feel drunk.


after getting lightly drunk i do a 15-25mg line, that awakens me up and i go have fun dancing chatting etc. i smoke cigarettes a lot, then continue with 25-30 mg lines until it's 6-7am. i do not drink more than 1-2 beers after dosing eph, i prefer drinking water or plain soda. i snort something like 100-150 mg total during my time out, which is until morning. if we throw out an after party in a friends house, i get 1-2 E pills, rolling a half every 1-1,5 hour. during the after party time i usually snort another 100-150mg eph total, in 30-50mg lines.


50-60mg line of eph on extacy is the bomb for me, it blows my mind out. i get superhuman speed and strength to dance, i get chills rushing my head skin, feeling intense goosebumps all over my head.


 i usually snort a total of 200-300mg eph during 12 hour party period which starts at midnight.


with small doses repeated, it's makes me sociable a lot in a friendly place. i talked with a suicide girl who normally has the image "unreachable" for guys like me, for like 2-3 hours continuously and made her into me.


when i go over dosages total of 300-400 mg, i became a functional zombie, i remember dj'ing for 14 hours continuously without even getting up from the chair i sit. i also remember the jeans which fit me perfectly without a belt were too loosy to stay up there without going down my legs after a single party, that day i lost 3-4 kilos.


i also had a terrible comedown from eph which a total of 500mg snorted during 6 hour period with lots of alcohol. i laid in bed for like 5 hours without getting a bit of sleep, not being able to do anything, feeling shitty, 10 track playlist repeating, was too thirsty but always had to have a bit more rest to get up and have some, not comfortable in both cold and warm. there were the times i had no fear on my heart, it just goes fast and tires but i didn't care.


finally after all eph i have is finished, i didn't order again, i knew i had to give it a break. 


i lost about 10 kilos during my 2-3 months with 4 gram eph. it's been about 4-5 months without it. i spent that last 4-5 months with really low doses of 25b-nbome and mild amounts of alcohol during weekend partying. now i am thinking of ordering it again and using it more wisely.


after 2-3 month period with eph, my right nostril stayed dry and sticky for like 3 months. and it had pain when i closed it pressing from the side.


i also had a friend who snorted a whole gram (1g) in 12 hours. said it was fine and able to bear comedown, no more details. 


**WARNING: 1 gram of eph in 12 hours, even in a day, IS REALLY TOO MUCH. that amount is just stupid, do not ever try it. also my combinations with alcohol, extacy, weed, spice and the other drugs are also really stupid; if you really want to try any combination with eph, start slow, experience the full trip with comedown, then go up a bit the way you think reasonable. a bit of alcohol takes your anxiety on eph, but also harmful on your heart.**

IV'ed another 200mg of ethyl burnt the fuck out of my vains. It Sent me sky high! which lasts about 5mins!!! My blood pressure monitor read 181systolic/120diastolic pulse 139 which is dangerous for a 27yr old to have Readings  that's  borderline hypertensive crisis levels. Felt like I might have a heart attack at one point.

I think I may be overdoing ethylphenidate I can get through 3-4g's a day I dream of being able to afford a kilo of it. I would probably die though from sleep deprivation and a heart attack. Christ I am a complete fiend.  An addict IV.eeeing IM.ing silly amounts like 1.5g at a go one big ass shot guess I have a high tolerance I have only had a maximum break of about four day no ethyl in about 3months

I personally have been smoking this new batch (and plugging just a bit of it), and it is the real deal like my first batch, maybe even more active. 8-15 mg smoked produces this instant euphoric body glow that builds over 5 minutes, it's often accompanied by this crazy nausea, which actually feels good. The nausea disappears over a few (probably 5 on average) minutes and the euphoria sticks around for quite a while. 


From only smoking it, and not exhaling through my nostrils, there still is a bit of caked blood in there, and my throat is a little raw, it has been for a few days; hopefully it leaves as fast as it came. I only ordered a gram, have been using it for 5-8 days or so, and still have about half of it left.

  I personally haven't had a bad comedown yet, but I also haven't taken that much in that short of period yet. From what I have read about the burning, how corrosive it is, your nose must have been FUCKED UP the next day?


As for not ordering again (at least for a while) good thinking. The dude posting directly after you could learn a thing or two. Well, really just that one thing, that it's good to chill out when you start pushing the limits, and stupid not to when you start taking a shit on them and then stabbing the poor limits to death (talking bout' you here Psychotropic87, you could be charged with capital murder of the limits).

Yes, not only a stimulant fiend, but an irresponsible stimulant fiend (maybe that's redundant and fiends are inherently irresponsible? dunno). See the post before yours. He did 4 grams over three months and lost significant weight, and mentions that 1 gram in one day is stupid to do, he's right on the money, and you're out [JUMPTO][/JUMPTO]doing that 'stupid' by a factor of four.


 I've done about 4-500 mg over a week. I haven't lost weight, but I have lost a ton of sleep, on the flip side I have gotten A LOT of cleaning done that I have been putting off for A LONG time. And that is with many tiny  doses over a week that you do in two IV hits? Not just ridiculous, fucking ridiculous. The only thing that would make sense is if your shit is purposefully cut, or you're getting a bad batch or something (I got a pretty bunk batch once, and could have done your doses and felt pretty much nothing), though I somehow doubt this is the case; your stuff is probably just the same as ours, you're just so far past the line of stupid dosing, you probably don't even remember crossing it. 


This drug does not cause that bad of tachycardia unless you're seriously overdoing it. I was doing 10-15 mg doses off of foil (in a couple of hits) I never notices palpitations or even tachycardia. Since my heart felt completely normal I didn't take my blood pressure. I'm of a similar age and those are some pretty fucked up blood pressure readings, like entering dangerous territory. Then again, you're doing more than 10 times the doses I am, and you're IVing it.


I'm not at all trying to talk down to you, just trying to get you to snap back to reality and realize how dangerous the way you're using this drug is, both the route of administration but more importantly the retarded doses. You already know it's way too much, so please take a break, and re-aasses your situation (And I mean a break longer than a week; three weeks to a month)


 If you did get ahold of 1kg, I vet you'd be using .1 Liter syringes to slam your doses. The way you're going  bout it would most certainly lead to your death or lifetime disability.


They do not have a 'spare heart cart' full of heart 'extras'  sized perfectly for 27 year olds sitting around somewhere for those that got too caught up in stimulants. Even if they had extra hearts, they'd be going to someone who didn't consciously risk their own heart. You've only got one, and it is a powerful thing, but you damage it, and you're pretty fucked. 


Please tell me you're at least using 'best practice' IV technique? Bacteriostatic water if storing it at all (benzyl alcohol at correct concentration, etc) ? Syringe filters? come on at least the syringe filters.  $30 for a 100 pack of filters, that's pretty cheap embolism (and it even filters a good amount of bacteriums) prevention: [http://www.ebay.com/itm/Syringe-Fil...594?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&hash=item4185344172](http://www.ebay.com/itm/Syringe-Filters-30mm-45-m-Nylon-Membrane-100-pack-Pink-Luer-Lock-Inlet-/281407668594?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&hash=item4185344172) 


Please don't tell me you're shooitng 200 mg up 10-20 times a day and you're just filtering it through a cig filter or some dangerous and dumb equivalent. If you can pay whatever you are for several grams of this stuff a day, you can at least pay for the small product losses from filtering, as well as the cost of the syringe filters


Do you shoot up because you have a needle fixation with your drug of choice or is this your drug of choice? What was your first dose ever with this substance? How much do you buy at a time?


Note: You should edit your posts if you want to add more information, not make another one. If nothing has changed (IE someone adding a post to the thread since your last post, there is no good reason to double post; it just makes things harder to read.

Finally got some more after running out for about 4 days, my tolerance went down pretty quick. It feels much cleaner and pleasant without tolerance, also my new batch has a chemical smell when others didn't? I don't know whether this is significant or not?


Does your 'phenidate have a smell, it's never smelt of anything before.

Ah ok, well I'm not going to flush it cause it smells a bit.


Don't know why I can't stop taking this, the short half-life doesn't help, have more control over speed which I think I've already said is way more euphoric (if it's decent stuff)


The comedown is mainly just anxiety and more anxiety.... fun ugh

My own brain chemistry has always responded well to ritalin/focalin/EPH.  They have the "come down easies".  An individual with my brain chemistry wouldn't heart shit, become paranoid, have delusions, become depressed while they're coming down.  When its done its done.  euphoria wise the order largest to smallest is focalin>ritalin>EPH, BUT you can redose and dose very high with EPH being that it doesn't have the affinity for norepinephrine.


I have a question for all of you.  An individual could have smoked enough for a bellringer and then some... how many days would it take in somebody's experience to be able to get effects from normal doses as an individual could usually take.

Got 5 pellets of this (25mg), plan on testing one.. maybe 2.. this weekend with alcohol. Not really doing much or going crazy drinking, just a few beers during the day watching tv and some rum and music at night. Curious what the comedown would be like off 1 or 2 and what sleeping would be like (just got some alcohol and OTC cocodamol).. after reading this thread people seem to have some awful comedowns and find it hard to sleep without benzos but at the same time I can't tell if thats just general or high doses/binging over a couple of days, 50mg over a day (from the sound of this thread) sounds pretty weak.


I'm not too bothered about the no sleep but I'd rather avoid going bed rolling around for hours on end, if I know in advance I can dose earlier and by the time its early hours of the morning hopefully the alcohol will aid my sleep.

otherwise its the sick feeling / comedown / tired feeling.  i can handle it fine, i just don't like the sickness so a benzo can help with that. i think you only get sick from large doses.  so your 50mg dose is easy to ride out, you might even sleep.  take 'em oral

An individual with my brain chemistry wouldn't heart shit, become paranoid, have delusions, become depressed while they're coming down.  When its done its done.  euphoria wise the order largest to smallest is focalin>ritalin>EPH, BUT you can redose and dose very high with EPH being that it doesn't have the affinity for norepinephrine.

Not sure if I understand the question, you are asking how long until tolerance drops back to normal?  I'm not sure, every time I've had it I've run out, and then not ordered it for a few months. After three months I felt 8 mg smoked very intensely; so not more than 3 months at the long end ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

last night tried some 'blue stuff' Eph crystals. 

Look nice, clear blue tinged crystals.


Snorted smaller line than usual, nose burn and smell same as normal eph

Effect was much more powerful, went through brief nausea after 20mins. 

Then buzzing all evening I took an etizolam to come down. Less urge to redose and i didn't


Will get more

Ok so somebody might have imagined ingesting 5 fucking grams of this fucking stimulant in 6 days.  You guys think such an act would cause significant brain damage?  I mean on top of the brain damage the dumb mother fucker already has.  Fucking blow my brains out


edit: when I start reading right of my center of my vision without moving my head my eyes don't focus that well, but I still can make it out


God not writing this in stone but sober vs doing drugs I'd rather pick overdosing and dieing.  I started out "If I give myself brain damage I won't ever be able to cope or stop hating myself"  why the fuck do meth heads want people to do it with them FUCKING FUCK got me into shit.  tweakers bait and switched me when i had an liking for addy now im a fucking stim friend/meth head/ dope fiend.  w/e they call it now

Crack sucks ass. Slightly disassociative compared to coke in a very negative way and the high only lasts like 15 minutes. Not that you care because after the first blast you immediately want another. I didnt like it at all but I certainly wanted more right away. Of all the drugs Ive tried crack has been the whackest. Very "uggghhh" feeling, not as clear headed as the good stims. And I love stimulants.

I don't know why ethylphenidate is so easy to abuse.  I've done very large amounts and I don't have panic attacks, I can just slowly bump myself down, and the worst that happened so far is I started overheating and had to take a very cold shower which felt amazing.  There was one day where my mind was going extremely fast I had to isolate myself to do this.  I'm praying to god I don't get epilepsy or have a stroke from how much I did.  First thing after this last bit is gone I'm starting an exercise regimen.  One time I had my leg at an odd angle for a long while and when I Tried to stand up it was like half my leg was asleep. I kept moving it and moving it and stoop up as hard as I could and it went away.  I don't think this is a stroke cuz it went away immediately when I just exerted the muscle for a few seconds


OH i just looked it up, the half life is less than 4 hours.  no fucking wonder!

If you use in this manner I doubt a scale would help you with self control. Your only hope if you buy 5 grams is to take out 200 mg or so and give the rest to a friend to hold on to, or throw the rest in an envelope and mail it to yourself ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) I bet crack is garbage due to the duration. I'd only try the stuff if I had pure freebase cocaine.

What makes you thing that you have obstructive sleep apnea? It occurs while you're asleep..... and I highly doubt ethylphenidate caused it if you do.

I doubt it has a higher BA, just a far faster onset. It's pretty euphoric, but the rush from plugging is great and better on your body, so I'd just plug it.

I think vaping is pretty sick Actually its a real good roa imo snorting some then vaping to set it off is the best I think although I'm sure it wastes some and I've been reading what a lot of people r saying about it converting to ritalinic acid in ur nose and it being mildly caustic so I'm thinking twice about my roa when i get my next order this morning cuz smoking something that's mildy caustic sounds like Not exactly the healthiest thing I'm sure it'll be fine if i vap a bowl or two but no more than that last time I started getting significant lung pain toward the end of my batch anybody else experience this it kind of worried me

Yeah this, its hard to get an idea of how moreish this stuff is with posts like this. For people who don't tend to hammer 5g of an RC how moreish is this? In relation to methedrone/methylone?.. wasn't a fan of methedrone cause of the short lived high and moreishness so would only take a small amount along with methylone. That said both were pretty moreish but I never abused it so to speak, could tell when I was just trying to delay the dreaded comedown and would let it happen.


Gunna try a pellet, got 5 and I've been drinking.. only really wanna test it out today so don't wanna go over 2 but I tend to lose a little self control if I've been drinking (nowhere near to the extent of some people in this thread though) so some idea of how moreish it is would be good. 


I cut off a small piece yesterday to check for negative side effects/allergies ect. and it was all good.

my experience with this stuff is that to begin with it's nice - you can use it, but over time it takes a toll, not even over time - but depending on how many times you do it. i snorted it every time i used it, and licked my fingers etc. not to mention the psychological damage, this stuff also fucks you physically. the causticity of this substance is unmatched.  i'm not going to ever use it again due to the following:


ethylphenidate is the first stimulant which has induced some kind of psychotic state in me, and it didn't take a lot. it's poison. i can vividly remember having a chat in my head regarding how "alice" was in control of my mind, but a dark evil force wanted to destroy alice - and i couldn't allow that to happen so i quite literally visually imagined destroying an evil looking village in my mind with my hand in order to protect alice and her good town, but as i grabbed and destroyed the evil village it regrew in other areas. that's the most vivid recollection of the psychosis - but i remember talking to myself A LOT about alice.... and having a genuine belief that this was how my mind worked. not to mention that i continued to snort ethylphen. luckily it ran out, or fucking god knows what my mind would've done.


this and 3,4-ctmp are just the slow burning psychosis inducing drugs. unlike MDPV which induced that state of psychosis instantly, this stuff will consume you slowly until you get there. 3-4,ctmp made me catatonic after around 6-7 hours into the experience, and i can see people dosing again. it took a LOT of benzos AND ALCOHOL (i've never had to use alcohol to bring myself down on any drug before) to remove the catatonic state i was in with 3,4ctmp. these ritalin analogues in my opinion are the most dangerous things to hit the market because it seems as if nothing is being done about them. consider how MDPV induced it's psychotic effects - now research how all these drugs act.


i've NEVER had a bad experience with methylphenidate in comparison. i've taken it at megadoses (500mg+) and apart from the fucking terrible comedown and jitters after the euphoria, no psychosis in the slightest. i don't know what it is about these different esters of ritalnic acid that are causing these terrible effects, but they are present...

@ synthetix how often and what doses were you doing if you don't mind me asking? Also what state was you taking it when it became a psychotic state? Party atmosphere or was it dosing on your own?


Seems a lot of people are reporting these psychotic downsides/potency.


As I said earlier its hard to get an idea of what its like when some people are hammering 5g in 6 days or doing it nonstop over 2/3 days.


About an hour into my first pellet (25mg), feeling the standard come up of a stim.. higher heart rate but not overly noticeable, feeling good but a bit sedated. I tend to feel overwhelmed and a bit lazy during a come up, hopefully the energy comes when it levels out. Bit rushy in terms of typing on the laptop but I feel like I have no intention of standing up any time soon haha.


Slowed down drinking as well, tend to be more focused on the laptop/tv than doing anything else.

I had the first pellet 4 hours ago, about an hour ago I felt like I was returning back to normal so I took another pellet (25mg), drank a fair amount (alcohol) now so no noticable come up like I normally get, the 2nd one is building on me nicely. I feel good.. the dosage I'm taking feels sensible over the amount of time I'm taking it. I feel tempted to do more but only because the results so far have been very mellow. I'm debating doing another one, not because its moreish but because the dosage and effects feels tolerable and it feels like I can go further without it turning into a no sleep/harsh comedown feeling.


I'm pretty good with stims and knowing my body and it feels like I could do another pellet, enjoy myself and go bed in 4/5 hours.


Is this false sense of security and will it kick in longer than I expected?


So far I've done less than 75mg over 8 hours and I'm debating another 25mg. Ideally if I was going to redose I'd like to do it now rather than later so if I do decide to get some sleep it'd be better.

applies to any stim


vaping.... try adding a bit of peg, it might make the smoke less disgusting

What is peg?  And what vap method is suitable, not smoking, just vaping..

I have heard that EPH's boiling point is 343.1±17.0 °C at 760 mmHg

Sounds like sleep paralysis to me.  Ease off the stims, see if you keep encountering it.

And definitely seek medical attention if you doz

I am not the biggest fan of this kind of stim, but do kind of like this one. I have learnt that it doesn't do well on redosing. For me the best way is to do a big line (yes, ouch!) to start with, then a smaller one, and then stop. After a while, I get frazzled. But maybe that's just me. But I do find it quite euphoric and useful for getting stuff done in particular. But it is just so caustic. Tried oral the other day, didn't really enjoy that though. Nasal and only once or twice for me and then its fine

Today in the hospital I was getting paranoid about the police presence so I was forced to IM (intramuscular injection) around 4grams of ethylphenidate all at ounce in 3+ 2.5ml barrels with 0.45ml needles attached to the end well all I can say is that I did this at around 2-3pm yesterday and fuck me I have never been so high in my life so much higher than IV cocaine a damn sight higher than IV crack cocaine it literally blew my brains out with sky high euphoria that came in waves of intensity and it's now 3:44am the next day and I am sitting in a hospital taken my meds 600mg quetiapine mr 30mg mirtazapine 600mg of gaberpentin and 5mg of haloperidol and 7.5mg of zopiclone and I am still not tired I wonder if I am the only one pushing this drug to the very limits of human possibilities breaking down boundaries with what most of you would call reckless behavior as a lot of you are so content with your 100mg BIGHITS that doesn't cut it for me they have to be 300-500mg IM whacks to give me anything worth writing about so I suppose I could of handled more than 4g's in one hit but it was a trip I will never forget. And now I am calling it a day for ethylphenidate just my prescription meds and clean living from now on but at least I went out with a Big Bang moment!!!!!!

Not really related but I did this with MDPV. Thought swat was outside my bathroom door. I even "saw" shadows. IV'd over a gram and a half to get rid of the "evidence" while in my subconscious I think I was trying to kill myself. I was miserable... Was interested in Ethylphenidate, but sounds like it might be a bad place to journey to...

If you can do this after shooting 4 grams of EPH into your muscle, I would be shocked, but I sure hope you go down this path.

Who the hell knows; subcutaneous injection of this shit is a bad idea anyway you chalk it up. I believe the only surefire way of limb loss is an intra-arterial injection. I don't understand why you would IM it anyway, even pulling out the needle and rectally dosing it would have gotten it into your blood more quickly, and this way is one of the safer routes.


Don't fucking inject it or any stimulant, or any pill, or really *anything, ever*. Fuck, if you must, vape eph. This route hits more quickly as it dumps the drug directly into your arterial blood. But the people shooting it probably have some sort of needle fixation. 


Funny, for me, IVing stuff for the short period I did made me permanently scared of needles. The process of cooking stuff up isn't a ritual, it felt desperate and disgusting as shit. If you still want to inject things go look up pictures from arterial injections or the thread which features scholarly articles on serious injection complications.

Fuuuuuck me. I finished off the last of a 5 gram bag last night, had been sniffing the shit every couple of hours since I got the bag a month ago. Obviously I didn't feel great this morning, but after remembering a post by Shambles saying that a bit of serotonin works wonders for dopamine depleation I dosed 90mgs of 5-APB. So far so good...

I don't understand why you would IM it anyway, even pulling out the needle and rectally dosing it would have gotten it into your blood more quickly, and this way is one of the safer routes.

I don't mean subcutaneous or arterial injections.  You'd have to really not know what you are doing for the latter.

What I mean is this stuff is so caustic, doesn't it eat away at muscle tissue and flesh when dosed with an intramuscular injection?

I'm talking about HR, and I understand people *do* IV this stuff and it causes pretty nasty vein damage, especially if it is not made into as dilute a solution as possible.

By that I mean - it's not advisable, but people do it.

Similarly, people advise plugging - but I've heard some reports of people experiencing some pretty freaky rectal damage with long term (or not sufficiently diluted) use.

Insufflation has reportedly burned through people's septums in a matter of weeks or months, like long term, heavy cocaine use (but far worse) and anecdotes about oral dosing seem to suggest that stomach ulcers or similar have been reported amongst heavy users.

I don't have sources for these things - just reports on forums and online. RC discussion.

It's scary, because it is such a compulsive, fiendish chemical.


At least IV use, the caustic solution is not sitting, stationary in a single place for minutes (unless people miss the shot- and from photos I've seen, that's not a pretty sight; chemical burns).  What this does to veins/heart valves/lungs/kidneys/capillaries...one can only speculate.

But this is what makes me wonder - what does IM ethylphenidate do to a user's muscle (and surrounding) tissue as it slowly absorbs?

I shudder to think.  It's just so damn caustic.

I have always used the 'Big crystal' form so couldn't comment. The burn isn't bad but trust me if you sniff it enough it damages your nose alot, it doesn't feel that bad actually sniffing it's once its up there and sitting in your nozz that it starts to do the damage which you don't directly feel. I find the burn gets worse the further into the session also until it numbs and that's when your pretty much knackered really.

When i measured and dosed orally, 50mg was a lil much for study 30mg worked better, I did dose up to 110mg oral with more insufflated on top which was fine.


Now i just snort medium lines, one up each side as needed/when needed. Unsure of dosage but they are pretty standard in size.

You could always measure out a maximum dose and then chop it into lines and do one once ever 15-20 mins till satisfied, pretty standard.


Dosage wise YMMV. 30mg sounds reasonable, i eyeball tho so....

It's just a mild burning, slight eye watering, and a drip for 20 minutes or so. My question is basically, is my stuff actually eph? It just seems strange so many people complain about the burn to me as I don't find it that bad.

Just wanted to say that even though the eph I was using produced very little burn it still caused **a lot** of permanent damage to my nose.

Forensic Sci Int. 2014 Jul 25;243C:126-129. doi: 10.1016/j.forsciint.2014.07.017. [Epub ahead of print]**[First detection of ethylphenidate in human fatalities after ethylphenidate intake.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25161162)**

Krueger J, Sachs H, Musshoff F, Dame T, Schaeper J, Schwerer M, Graw M, Roider G.


> Methylphenidate, a psychostimulant drug from the group of amphetamines is, among others, established in the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and narcolepsy. It is also known to have a certain potential of abuse. In combination with alcohol, the metabolite ethylphenidate was detected in human plasma in small amounts. However, ethylphenidate is sold as "research chemical" via the Internet. It was put under German narcotics law in July 2013. In a recent case, where a deceased person was found in his apartment, the police seized a plastic bag with the inscription "ethylphenidate". An autopsy of the 32-year-old man yielded a mitral valve endocarditis, which must have persisted a while before death, in combination with a pneumonia. At the Forensic Toxicological Centre (FTC) in Munich femoral blood, liver, pericardium fluid, urine, stomach content and hair of the deceased were analyzed for ethylphenidate after sample preparation by an LC-Triple TOF 5600. [...] femoral blood 110ng/mL, for liver 180ng/g, for pericardium fluid 131ng/mL [...] [the] results can only be compared to methylphenidate concentrations with therapeutic levels ranging from 5 to 60ng/mL in serum. As the toxic levels for methylphenidate start from approximately 500ng/mL serum, we estimate that ethylphenidate in the concentrations mentioned above is not in a directly lethal range. But it has to be considered, that amphetamine-like drugs as methylphenidate are known for their cardiovascular side effects (like tachycardia and arrhythmia) and might therefore have contributed to death, which was attributed to endocarditis in combination with pneumonia.

Moral of the story: don't be doing ethylphenidate if you have any sort of heart problems. Or pneumonia.

So I had been vaping this shit, it was moreish but with less and less euphoria as it went on, crack-like and anxiety provoking, heart palpitations. I started plugging it, went back to being euphoric, no anxiety, no paranoia (I wasn't *psychotic paranoid* seeing shit, but I don't usually think about grabbing my .45 to let my dog out at 2am ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png) but that dog makes it worse when she just looks at me and stares at the door like she's hearing shit. Crazy dog.). In conclusion, don't smoke it (god don't snort it), plug it or take it orally.


One thing I find completely different bout' this stuff then other stims is that an hour after dosing I can sleep fine or at least go unconscious, but I'm getting to REM and real sleep cause I'm dreaming. (was in a crazy marching band in a giant mall singing [this song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5x_YoweEg8), lol surreal, less a marching band, more... think thriller), yet others mention not being able to sleep for many many hours. I don't get it, that applies to me with amphetamine and the like/cathinones/and other substituted amphetamines, but not EPH.


Edit: Apparently you can sleep fine an hour after vaping it. Rectally dosing it extends the duration quite a bit. At least the plasma levels are A LOT more even and I don't feel like jumping out of my skin, and can dose once every four or five hours instead of what a crack binge surely looks lie.

Quick question, powder v crystal? What's the pro's v con's of either? 


Surely the powder is smoother, though crystal is ever so slightly more expensive?

I don't think there's much difference, I mean, if you took the powder and put it in water would it not crystalize? I've just never had the stuff. When I do it with these tiny little crystals (the first time they were HUGE, breaking bad meth huge). 


In conclusion, dunno, only ever had one kind, and it was never powder. The only con is if they're cutting the powder with something, bit easier to do than with crystals. But I really have no clue. 


By give it a try you mean smoke it? That was way more unpleasant. Jittery, palpitations. As I said, the rectal dosing lasts forever, and is safer.

Insufflation most probably. I think I'll go for the powder... snorting crystals makes me a little uncomfortable, would be harsh on the nasal cavity?


I don't mind plugging... I plug Oxy sometimes. No big deal tbh. I've had some great highs by plugging.

Thinking about getting a gram of this, but like a couple of people can't choose between powder, rock crystal or small crystal... 


Might just get the rock crystal and break it down to powder.

I find no real difference between the powder and crystal.

This. 


I found ethylphenidate to produce noticeable feelings of tightness, "hard" heartbeats, etc even on low oral doses. 


Most of this is probably attributable to anxiety, and methylphenidate is prone to cause this for me as well... But I suspect that ethylphenidate is deeply more cardiotoxic than it's more common brother; and much more risky than people realize.

This, single report in a guy who had "mitral valve endocarditis," should not worry you. It's the only case of ethylphenidate toxicity I could find. There are plenty of reasons to go easy or not use it at all, this really isn't one of them.  


"Hard" heartbeats are called [palpitations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palpitations) if you mean you can feel your own pulse. I can chalk all of the anxiety up to this. A single lopressor ER (metoprolol) and I went from feeling like a wreck to feeling quite nice. 


Also plugging a larger dose seemed to flatten the blood levels and make it FAR more bearable than vaping/snorting it which made it far more moreish and unsatisfying. 


Honestly, I wouldn't touch this stuff if I didn't have the beta blocker. I also spent quite a bit of time looking for interactions with beta blockers or cases of unopposed alpha adrenergic action leading to any negative stuff with either this or it's analogues. Couldn't find anything.  I felt a bit better about trying it.

lol Every page here compares that. But here it goes:


Snorting: Many people say vast amounts of pain. Having done FAR more painful shit I disagree, but I agree with the one post who says it's not that bad but it seems the damage is still done like it was. I'd not do it this way.


Plugging: As I mentioned above the smoother way of going about it, vaping this stuff is like crack with uncomfortable peaks and troughs. Plugging it lasts longer and is more balanced. 


Orally would probably be the safest, your stomach is best at handling caustic things. Post your feelings of how they differ. I had rock-salt lookin' stuff. Dissolved in water and evaporated left cool looking crystals ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Aah sorry if that's an annoyingly common question. I've literally just come across it, ordered some yesterday and just tuned into this thread without reading any of it. I'm gonna go back 5 pages and give it a read before I try it tomorrow. 


I've read up on the snorting pain, which is why I asked about plugging. Some say it burns like fire, some say it's uncomfortable but tolerable enough to carry on doing it. 


I hadn't even thought about Oral... I didn't think it'd have much effect. I think I'll start of by a small oral dose, just to check I'm okay with it. Then give it a go snorting/ingesting/plugging it and just seeing what I enjoy the most, if any. And also determine whether powder v crystal makes any difference. 


Read some horror stories about rapid heartbeat which is kinda off putting.

Seems to me a heart develops a tolerance to this stuff.

I normally plug 100-150mg's or more split into 3 or 4 hourly/0.5 hourly increments of about 50mg's each.


Right now I am binging, just for the hell of it, out of 6 days I did it 5 times (including what I just pushed into myself)


Total 24 hr's fap.


One other thing, I have also been taking Acetildenafil (when I can't get up easily), crazy combo.


And yes, I am aware that this is forming a habit for me, on my days off I say to myself, tonight yes, but tomorrow I will lay off it, suuuuure I do. ![:!](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/argh.gif)

Heart develop tolerance? Not in my experience... For me, take enough and most of the anxiety is the tachycardia and even palpitations. The vasoconstriction left me feeling odd, feet cold. 1 100mg lopressor and it actually became pleasant again, and quickly.

I've railed and parachuted ethylphenidate on many occasions. Conclusions: the 1 or 2 hour buzz (much like a weaker/dirtier coke buzz) isn't worth the next 10 hours of feeling like complete crap. Even a tonne of benzos doesn't help that comedown. Despite the comedown, it's an RC that always draws me back. This is probably because it is a potent inhibitor of dopamine reuptake. More so than methylphenidate. This is the type of RC that can destroy your life lol.

^^it's not that bad as a stim RC... its not MDPV.... 


People were talking about smoking it i read on BL i think that smoking (m)ethylphenidate was caustic, so shouldn't be done too much, i quite enjoyed vaping, but stopped when i read it was caustic.

Never had the opportunity to try MDPV. Sounds ridiculously potent - a recipe for disaster. Vaping ethylphenidate? That's probably the worst ROA for EPH. Apparently plugging it is the way to go, but I just don't think it's worth it. Those EPH after effects are devilish.


I'm actually expecting a gram of it through the post today. Might give it to a friend. I'm done with that stuff.

Perhaps now, after some time has passed, is a good time to reply... And the simple answer is no! We often take EPD, but haven't used this ROA since purely due to not having enough quantity-wise to justify the amount (albeit small) of wastage that smoking it entails. One of these days we'll have to do it again, because it was so so smooth, and so brilliantly stimulantly-manic, yet totally under control.


(NB, manic used tentatively, as I suffer from occasional bouts of actual mania myself, they are not pleasant, and I wouldn't want to offend anyone else who does)

Thanatos, I have a few friends that absolutely go nuts with the ethylphenidate. Since I generally enjoy the Pharmacodynamics/kinetics comprehension of these interesting compounds, I did some studying of the effects on the specific area of neuronal synapses of this chemical. I quite easily discovered that catecholamines are used of which norepinephrine, epinephrine, and dopamine are categorized. Ethylphenidate is a dopamine re-uptake inhibitor but moreso than it is for norepinephrine. From this information I noticed that N-acetyl L-tyrosine, a commonly used and sold nutritional supplement, is a precursor to a necessary amino-acid L-Tyrosine which is then synthesized in the body to become Dopamine and from that, norepinephrine as well as epinephrine, The perfect comedown mediator.


This is a better way to see what im trying to say. I forgot L-Dopa is created before dopamine.

Like you mentioned in what I quoted, perhaps because I take wellbutrin this also mediates the comedown?

Got 1g of crystal and 1g of powder today. Sucked on a small 25mg crystal (eyeballed) and despite the foul taste/numb tongue, all seemed fine. Just ordered some new mg scales which wont be here until Thursday, so I'm going to be patient and wait for them to arrive before eyeballing any more doses. Plus I'd like to write an accurate log/trip report and as such would want to know how much I took, mg for mg.

No chemical burn? Got any narrow or wide pH strips? Why do you need several mg scales? Also, if your scale is .01g accurate, you could weigh out .25g and volumetrically dose it rectally, though I'd probably wait for the .001g scales, which ones did you order? Not where from, just brand/model... lemme guess AWS Gemini or the like?

Depends on the person... even if effects are less pleasant that low price tag might keep you coming back for more.  (oh you're answering a question lol)


I'm curious as well, but I bet it isn't in the same fucked up league as MDPV and some of the cathinones.

There's a difference between dependency and a moreish compulsion. Yeah benzo addiction may suck more... but it generally lacks the fiendish, crazyed nature of stimulants.

It's more-ish. So more like cocaine than meth. 


That being said, I imagine most "ethylphenidate addicts" are just "stimulant addicts" who happen to consume ethylphenidate because of availability/price/legality/etc. It hardly has a unique pull. (Unlike mdpv, etc)

Luckily, this product of Satan is so corrosive in every method of administration which is possible in the human body - [and of course the callous moreishness which can drive many a man to the very edge of sanity] which prevents it from becoming what we could realistically call an 'addictive substance'. 


Of course, there are probably boys and girls right now who snort this stuff on a daily basis - my 6th sense tells me that permanent ear, nose and throat damage will physically stop the everyday user eventually. Having said that, I have tried it myself and there's a sweet spot which is intensely enjoyable. But as the famous philosopher Nostrilus Sinusitus said in AD43, "Curses - I haveth numerous holes inside my face which were not before present..", or something like that.

Ain't corrosive at all when dissolved in lukewarm water and plugged. You feel no burn whatsoever and bioavailability is superior to all other ROA's except IV. This quality makes it addictive however.

Finally got round to trying this last night after my scales arrived. I've got a history of generalised anxiety and an even longer history of heart palpitations so I just wanted to be reassured that I was dosing correctly.


Racked it. Snorted it. An good God that bites back. I think snorting molten lava would give it a good run for it's money.


Overall, I wasn't too impressed by it. Maybe that's harsh..? It just wasn't as expected. However, I was in an awful lot of pain in the the morning at work and took 100mg MS Contin at lunchtime and was definitely still feeling quite sedated/drowsy from that during the evening when I got back from work so maybe that didn't go in its' favour.


It seemed fairly enjoyable, but contrary to what others have reported, I never experienced any rush at all - and did re-dose 4x throughout the evening. May be better off snorting a larger quantity at first, instead of re-dosing. Or maybe it's effects are just more subtle than anticipated. 


Buuuut, it was my first time and as said, due to my anxiety & heart palpitations I consciously erred on the side of caution. 


Will give it another go a little bit later on tonight.

Well I had a quick change of plans for the night so just tried it again and snorted 50mg about half an hour ago. I'm still not really feeing any effects other than my chest feeling noticeably hot, to the point it's actually a little uncomfortable and I've just taken my shirt off. Also, my heartbeat's sped up a tad - not much though, less than a morning coffee would cause it to anyway.


Also my teeth are aching. Last night I found that I was clenching my jaw shut quite a lot without consciously knowing I was doing it, until I took a sip of my drink, which is a bit weird. I can't say I've read too much into Ethylphenidate, just a quick browse, but I don't recall reading anything about that. I'm just chilling in my bedroom listening to music at the moment so feeling very relaxed but despite that I've just realised my jaw has been clenched shut again for the last 20 minutes or so. 


Starting to feel that Ethylphenidate is a bit of a disappointment ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png) 


Suggestions?

If I were you,I`d stop snorting it. The burn is massive and while the effects come on quicker,they also fade faster. This causes people to chase the high by snorting over and over again. Which speeds up the damage to the sinus membranes.

i would suggest that either you cap up and swallow the dose or mix with a small amount of water and plug it. There is zero pain with either method and the effects are longer lasting.

Been an hour now and not felt a thing, totally disappointed and very tired so going to sleep.


edit: I originally made this post ^^^ this morning at 02:06 but I'm just updating it this afternoon at 16:01.


Despite snorting 80mg, from which I gather - should have perked me up and kept me awake for a fair while, I feel asleep very shortly after making this post. I'd say within ½h, probably ¾h at max - I felt very tired. Had a perfect night sleep with no distractions/interruptions and was woken up by my alarm at 11:00AM feeling super tired and a bit groggy, so a good 8h sleep. Also woke up with a massive headache.

Bunk? Had a whole 1g batch that I swear to god was rock candy made by satan. I mean actual fucking candy. 


Don't smoke this shit, those quick bursts are euphoric at first, but they're definitely damaging and you feel it *after* the use. The troughs and hills of blood plasma turn it into crack. I find rectally thoroughly dissolved in water the most even route which produces the least anxiety/tachycardia.


Of course then again I said the last few day's I've taken a single lopresser ER once daily.

Well after the 2 very disappointing experiences of snorting ethyl powder I just plugged ethyl crystal so will see how changing them two variables differs in effects, if at all. 


Will keep a brief log:


**T+00:00** 50mg of crystal plugged - completely guessed what dose to take, based on what others have suggested (but weighed on mg scales)

**T+00:10** Not really sure what the average onset time is, but nothing as of yet. Gonna go put some laundry on to wash.

**T+00:20** Would've thought I'd experienced even a little something by now. Starting to think that 50mg was too small.

**T+00:30** Still nothing, actually feeling very chilled and a little dopey. Fancy a nice espresso but don't want that skew the experience.

**T+00:40** Bored & tempted to quickly snort some to try and hurry it up, but I guess that'll defeat the whole purpose of trying out plugging.

**T+00:50** zZzZzZ... Just reading some reports about how good sublingual use is. Might give that a try at T+01:00


Okay so that just didn't work at all for some reason, after reading about the wonders of sublingual use I'm going to re-dose and give that a try.


**T+01:00** 50mg of crystal crushed into a powder and put under my tongue. The taste is disgusting, the numbing is instant, but bot were  anticipated.

**T+01:05** Okay so maybe crushing it was a wrong move. I uncontrollably and instantly salivated massively. Within minutes my mouth was full of saliva, trying not to swallow and keep it under there as long as possible, I eventually have to give up and swallow the saliva. Maybe I should've just popped the crystal under there whole to suck on slowly and absorb that way? - I'd appreciate any thoughts on that?

**T+01:10** The front of my tongue is incredibly numb, I can bite on it quite hard and feel the pressure but not the pain. Seems to work very well as a local oral anaesthetic. Weird thought but I might keep some aside for if I ever have a painful mouth ulcer. Better than benzo/lido-caine!

**T+01:20** Still not feeling much, fingers do feel a bit light though. Just read a common side effect is 'penis-shrinkage' - thank God for that. Now I can blame my small dick on having used Ethylphenidate. That's honestly the only good that's come out of this 'experience' so far.

**T+01:30** Still nothing so going to end this report now. 


Well I don't know what to say... Every time I've tried this, it's just been thoroughly disappointing. Perhaps expected too much from it due to the glowing reports of other users on BL... I can only think that:


**The effects of it are subtle and I'm just not noticing them because I'm looking for more of an impact.**

I doubt this, because even in small doses, quite a lot of BL users have stated that it's onset is fast with a noticeable rush in some instances. They also report feeling noticeably perked up and energetic, in a different frame of mind. It's also referred to as a 'potent stimulant' pretty much everywhere on line. 


**My scales are dodgy.**

I doubt this, not only because they're brand new, but because I was able to calibrate them before every use by using a calibration weight that was supplied with them. Furthermore, I also tried weighing a few different coins and their reported weight was pretty damn accurate to what the internet says their weight should be.


**I'm not taking a high enough dose.**

I think this is a possibility, however, the doses I'm taking are in line with what other users have taken and then reported back with very positive experiences. I think I'm going to try 100mg plugged in an hour or so as a last ditched attempt.


**The product isn't good quality.** 

I think this has to be the most plausible answer, as I just can't think of any other reason that can explain why it's been so rubbish. However, it was purchased from the UK's biggest online vendor and I've used the vendor quite a few times for other stuff such as Etizolam, and it's always been fine. So that's left me wondering... keeping in mind, I bought 1g of powder and 1g of crystal and both were rubbish, so again, not really sure. 


I think I'm going to try once more at a much higher dose and then give up with Ethylphenidate. I might consider buying just 500mg or so a different vendor to see if that's any better, but I'm not holding my breath.


Other than that, I now look forward to going back to using Oxycodone.

it's a pretty plain stim, little euphoria, but gets one chatting a lot IME (i usually mix it with psychs though with a co-tripper)... alone, i just gives me a lot of pep, but im very sensitive to EPH, i prefer s/l or parachute for ROA... too much in a night dos start to give me headaches though, and again in the morning (or after having slept a little, depending on my sleping pattern at th time)


What i find good about taking EPH with psychs is it gives me a lot of energy, but doesn't affct the psych experience, apart from being spedier... unlike a stim like 4-FA (which i far prefer alone) but might "take too much space" over the psych, i dunno....

Ok, so I took a good amount plugged the last 2-3 days,  I've taken maybe 1.5- 2 grams rectally, maybe 1.66? I've been stationary a good majority playing with linux, CLIs, and virtual machines and didn't quite notice any pain in my foot, just a sore spot on my ass, dunno if it was like a pressure point. Well today on that side mt foot (left) swelled the fuck up bigger than I've ever seen it, and just a bit on the right. 


Hurts like fuck, little needley pains everywhere, 


Word to the wise, when you're immeshed in something else for a long period, make sure you're sitting comfortably and freely. It's also a damn dining room table chair (pretty, not ergonomic at all). And I was trying to prop myself up with some sheets to remove the pressure point and it seemed to work.


The pain started about as soon as I stood up, or at least went from a tingle to a 4-5. It's half that or less now. I thought that was odd.


It was all odd, I've taken higher doses of other stims, and never been in this much pain. I'd call it positional hypoxia for lower limbs (knee down, worse in foot). I doubt it was the vasoconstriction, the first times I did EPH there were noticeable pressor effects like cold hands, in that case they were white.... not bright red.


Now at about two-2.5 hours all that's left is mild pain 1-2 and very little swelling. So fucked up, and it seemed to happen quickly. Be careful how you sit!


(I started writing this at around 2pm in tons of pain it's 530 now and it's almost all gone.


Which one shall I get to prevent this? They're both within 20 bucks of each other on amazon, the right is cheaper.


I call them: *The Persistence Of Memory....foam-free chairs*

I think for euphoria it goes 4fa (maybe meth)>Amhet>EPH>2FA 2FA is where the euphoria is dead and you're riding on a surge of lightning! Good thing about that stuff is paranoia and tachycardia generally never came with it's energy. I think EPH might be more euphoric than Amphet if you wait a long time. I have never almost puked from a high quantity of euphoria, has happened several times with EPH.

Ethylphenidate yesterday also seemed to give me a histamine release... I was rubbing my nose every 20 seconds like I just swallowed 14 roxis. Yet.... I haven't had an actual opioid (not loperamide) in weeks. I found that odd, and it had strange euphoric spikes.

The right is also uglier. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder I know, I know. But the eyes of this beholder sore at the sight of that crafty thang. But before getting a new chair I suggest trying an adjustable footrest with your current office chair unless you really hate it. Footrest does wonders for me on EPH, keeps me from wrapping my knees around the seat's edge so that my feet could rest on the chair's "spokes" that hold the wheels.   This positional issue is supposedly a cause for circulatory problems in lower limbs while one is on vasoconstrictive drugs. But if you absolutely must get one of those "chairs" , take the left one ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Chair I'm sitting in now....


![2f0cbbk.gif](https://www.bluelight.org/community/proxy.php?image=http%3A%2F%2Fi60.tinypic.com%2F2f0cbbk.gif&hash=f1edebf460c1c321d98eab5205b3bc4e)


Current one... lol, no arm rest. 


I want that cray 1400$ Pixel by Herman Miller, incredible chair. 


And this damn thing keeps leting air out, I'm almost 6' and my ass is like 1.4 feet from the floor lol

it still doesn't have that fucked up pressure point of the other chair. I was scared shitless. 


COMPARTMENT COMPARTMENT! RHABDO RHABDO!  OH SHIT! BYE FOOT!


Probably excessively, but then again there's the potential of a stroke as the blood slows in your extremities from something like that,.

Gotcha. This definitely annihilates even the chair on the right in the "esthetically challenged" department. If I ever dared bringing this home my GF would have me drive it to a landfill myself, just to make sure.  :D

Some people seem to feel this much more than others. I don't snort it cause I agree with the other guy, it really doesn't hurt much *but* it does do extreme damage. It's probably more dangerous than the shit that hurts a TON. I thought some of the cathinones, older RC stims now banned hurt WAY more. 4-FA WAY MORE! If I didn't realize how much it fucked you up I'd probably still be vaping it. 


So far my lungs and my heart are thanking me. It's amazing how horrible you can feel while ridding that stimulation when vaped/snorted. Uneasy, anxious, palpitations, pronounced tachycardia, and how it almost all disappears when plugged (I would guess it's smoother orally too *shrug* I parachute as little as necessary. After swallowing balls of kratom it now makes me gag).

you didn't just straight up snorth the stuf out the bag did u? you did crush and work it into as fine a powder as possible (even then you can tell snorting isn't great, it's not 2Cx or 4-FA, but still...)... either way, may fav roa or this is sublingual, a small dab now and again, not looking for euphoria, just waiting till i can get some legit ritalin to be able to concentrate a bit...

But it's still hideous ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)


From the looks of it the more you pump the less backrest is available. How can that be comfortable? Or is it supposed to be kept inflated at low pressure?

Yeah same here but I think it was DOS 3.0. The monochrome composite monitor was definitely green characters on black background which was later "upgraded" to amber. Machine was a spankin' 286 which cost something like 4 or 5 G's in the day and featured exciting games like Chess with Boris and monochrome Missile Command with squirrel sound effects. And floppies were actually floppy.

Maybe it was 3? I don't remember lol. I played 'bricks' (click the bricks... shit falls.) castle, chip and dale (wasn't in color though):

 Also on a green and black screened computer. Never saw an amber one, went from that -> Windows 95, quite the shock!

I stuck with DOS until 5.0 because pre-Win95 versions of Windows sucked. But at least when we got to Win95 it had games like Castle Wolfenstein, Dunne and Fleet Defender, which prompted me to get a color SVGA monitor (15-inch NEC Multiscan CRT, $700), plus an Ad Lib sound card (there were no others back then) and some 3dFx graphics card with an impressive (but very tiny) fan on it. Today's larger LCD monitors are okay (provided you stare straight at 'em) but they don't display 16 resolutions with auto-switching. Ah the golden days...

Amber-on-black composites were touted as more ergonomic because the text was brighter than greens especially under bright lighting conditions but I don't think it caught on much because the BW VGA's that appeared almost simultaneously were a million times superior... as was their pricing. Color VGA's soon displaced those as well. This all happened as I was doing my Computer Science Bachelor's so I remember the details, especially the expenses but thanks to sponsorship programs we got corporate grants for many of those or I'd have starved.

I hope so too.  It's never too late.  I really hope you are well.  Reading your words makes me not want to try this anymore, which is probably best.  Looks like it's back to the mind expanding lessons of mxe for me.


And to think I almost jumped on the stim train again, well I kind of did.  I have a psych appt b/c I'm trying to score some dexedrine.  These RC's don't compare to good old dexy.  Chances are I may have to start off on ritalin, but hopefully adderall.  It may take a little work to get the doc to amp it up a notch to dexies.  Anyways I shouldn't be discussing this, I'm just speaking on my current stimulant infatuation.


Ain't nothin' like making the system work for you.  Maybe that's not a good idea either, but like I said I already stepped on the train and it sure ain't so easy to jump off once you've boarded.

Since I am the author of the article and subject of the experiments (the second one is housed in the pharmacology section), I just want resume the situation by saying this. We now have the means for a comfortable stims ride whose side effects will no longer gnaw at our quality of life. Smooth stim, clean stim, dirty stim, work stim, none is to fear anymore. So bring them on and to the cops: STFU and leave us as peaceful as we leave you. Have a nice evening all ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

A couple, maybe few more modrate sublingual doses of EPH and i've finished my 5g's, i decided not to re-order (counting on my doctor to Rx me ritalin or Modafinil for ADD on wednesday)... anything i should be prepared for...? slight cravings i suppose, a lack of motivation for 24 maybe 48 hours, maybe a bit grumpy, but that's about it no? I'll prob take a few different benzos, some booze, and have some spare bupe to double my dose eceptionally if i'm really not feeling well to smoothe this transition.


I really got into constant EPH use, morn to evening, redosing as soon as i started to feel a slight come-down... i had no problem stopping taking 4-FA, which is more euphoric (by far) etc. after a 10gram binge but have quite a bit of apprehention about running out of EPH...


any advice?

Yup sounds like me last time I did 5g EPH, last MAY IRC. The expecting of new stims in a near future (Rx or not) likely plays a psychological role in the alleviating of more serious symptoms imho

It's probably more dangerous than the shit that hurts a TON. I thought some of the cathinones, older RC stims now banned hurt WAY more. 4-FA WAY MORE! If I didn't realize how much it fucked you up I'd probably still be vaping it.

Hi,


I apologise if I have missed it, but I am just making my way through this thread now.


To which post or comment, or on what basis was EPH does extreme damage with snorting ROA??


EDIT - Sorry I think I have answered my own question. I take it was in regards to the caustic effects?


Thank you.

Anyone have any idea of the B-A's of the different ROA's of EPH? (apart from IV which i presume is 99-100, IM probably 90+), what about intranasal, plugged, sublingual, oral?

The sickest thing about stim addiction is that you still keep using them even after you have begun to really hate them.  


Every comedown that drains your soul, literally making you feel a sense of impending doom that it the worst feeling ever.


We say, THIS ISNT WORTH it at all during the comedown, the real paranoia, extreme anxiety, and other hell like symptoms.


But give it a few days and magically your brain just remembers that initial high, that euphoric rush, that pleasure that is otherwise in achievable .


But the high doesn't match the low, and stims turn you into a complete weirdo.

No the only thing they leave is the wish you had chosen a different ROA. This is not a joke, EPH can easily damage nose and sinus tissue even with moderate use as if the ordeal with the pain wasn't torture enough. And this coming from an EPH lover... but one who plugs the stuff. Smaller dose, superior high. Small price to pay for dropping your pants just make sure you're alone or in appropriate company.

Ya i heard plugging eph is the way to go.  Plugging is one of the most sophisticated ROA'S IMHO.  But ignorant people will say ewww im not going to plug a drug even though it is the most effective ROA for something like eph.   Btw i still need to read your blog Kilfer, once i have time and stimulation!

Howdy fellow ethyl users! Just got a nice lil bit after a long break. Love it as much as I did (in moderation of course, hehh...)


Question: Last ethyl I had years ago when I was in the UK, crystalline and pure white. This time it's khaki, on the lighter side. It seems to be nice then the white batch, although I have also taken CBD. Any input?


Good night lords and madams :D

I plan on getting some of this soon and experiment on it's effectiveness in keeping me focused. I suspect I may have some sort of ADD but haven't had an official diagnosis yet. If I dose oral only I guess this could fill the void until I get a proper script. I'll keep you guys updated.

 Plugged, most definitely. 50 to 60% of oral dose gets you the same rush and lasts almost as long. Never tried that with the large crystals we mostly get now. Powder HCL was more suited for the purpose. Still have access to that but it's gotten more expense since the crystals have become the norm lately.

Hey guys, just need a little guidance please.


I've been snorting 100mg at a time. Usually 25mg up the left nostril then 25mg up the right nostril, pausing for 5 minutes, and then following it up with another 25mg in each nostril. Whilst it does seem to do the job, I do find that:


1) Physically, it's actually quite a lot of powder to snort and I feel that a lot of it is probably being wasted - I often get quite a prominent and prolonged drip.

2) I absolutely hate the burn from snorting it - though this is much more tolerable when I'm only using a smaller amount to re-dose.


Since plugging it isn't very convenient for me to do, I guess that leaves me with ingesting it orally - which I've never actually tried. So:


1) How does oral compare to intranasal?

2) I assume that if I changed from intranasal to oral, I'd have to increase the dose? If so, how much would you recommend I adjust it by?


Many thanks in advance for anyone who can help,

I tried Ethylphenidate for the first time the other day. I am an experienced drug taker, 15 years+, and sourced it from a reputable site. I've tried it a few times now and I really enjoy it. My main issue with it is that it's REALLY uncomfortable on the nose, especially if done a few times. If it's used regularly or in large quantities it wouldn't take long to cause damage and I've not really had that thought about snorting other substances before. I've had no issue with racing heart, like I had from Mephedrone (hate the stuff), or any other negative side affects when compared to other substances. Great stuff, nasty on the nose...but wouldn't be as good if it was bombed.


Edit - I have made a decision to purposely not buy any more ethylphenidate.  My reason is that I've had addictions in the past, once with amphetamines, and I'm old enough and wise enough to spot when I could have a problem with a substance. Ignore the reviews that tell you that this stuff isn't moreish because it is! I can see this drug taking off quite quickly and easily

^ I would strongly advise against this.

You know that the pain caused by insufflating ethylphenidate is because it is literally corroding the soft tissue in your sinus, right?


By adding a local anaesthetic, you are masking the pain in a way that will allow you to ignore your body's warning signs that you are doing something harmful.

Reducing the *symptoms* of drug-induced harm in this case *increases* the likely damage.

It's a seriously bad idea - without even taking into consideration the potential interaction and toxicity of using another stimulant in this way.

I don't mean to lecture - but bluelight is *all about *harm reduction...not how to get high without it hurting.  

I think in cases such as this there is a big difference.

(Welcome, by the way!)

Hi,


Just out of interest why is plugging not convinient for you?? Granted I know the concept my seem alien, but there is absolutely nothing to it. Especially if you have EPH pellets, just put a bit of lubricant on the hole and pop the pill up. No pain at all, no discomfort and the pellets are tiny. It's like dropping a pin head in a wizards sleeve tbh.


Out of interest, I won't be snorting EPH ever again, despite that ROA being my favourite with more tolerable substances. I am however wondering whether plugging EPH pellets (Or powder/crystal) would have any sort of corrosive effect with the anal glands at all?


EDIT - And I agree, for a lot of substances either oral or plugging seems to provide the most effective results in the quickest time. Only a handful of substances seems tolerable and effective snorted. I'm not taking a like to oral or plugging as a great way of ROA.

I've done it when I'm at home and it was fine for that... but I don't spend much time at home any more. I'm usually at work or out and about with friends.

Tried this a few times, oral, I don't like it & I'm not tempted to try smoking snorting or injecting, it seems quite a harsh chemical. It's a powerful mental stimulant, gives a dopamine rush, but there's no physical energy, no adrenaline, no drive to do work. It seems easy to overdo it too. I'm just going to save it for occasional micro doses, although I can't really think of many occasions it'd suit. I was hoping it'd be more like amphetamine, but it's not even close, no good for cleaning the house or anything that requires a bit of physical energy.

*bump* - I would still like some advice on the above please! I'm having a hard time snorting this stuff at work!


**[User Review]**


Some of you may remember my earlier posts where I was slating this drug and remarking that I was less than impressed with its effects after reading other users' reviews. However, I did admit that I suspected that it may have been down to poor product, despite being purchased from a well renowned and respected online supplier within the UK.


I read numerous reports that, although notably subtle in its effects, it could be enjoyable if insufflated in doses as low as 25-50mg... which I never experienced. It wasn't until insufflated 100-150mg that I could appreciate its effects, which pretty much confirmed by initial thoughts that the product wasn't the quality I had expected. Accordingly, I could still enjoy ethylphenidate, I just had to take more of it... I soon saw off the initial 2g and decided to order from a different supplier to see whether my suspicion regarding the quality of the product was true.


This time, I decided to order it from the most well-known supplier within the UK, but consequently, it was also the most expensive supplier in the UK... (however, I saw that they were flogging all their Etizolam and Diclazepam at half price, so I bought 1,000x Etizolam tabs - which was an otherwise unknown bonus!)


So despite paying more, would I actually get more bang for my buck?


**Yes sir!**


So. I got my order this morning and carefully weighed it... 3.42g! Not a huge freebie, but not bad at all seeing as I only paid for 3g, huh! There are actually several user reviews on their site saying that the buyer received more product than ordered, whether by weight of powder or number of tablets, so this was a nice little surprise for me! Kinda makes me feel better about paying more for it now. I assume the reviews are all real, but most probably selectively moderated prior to public publishing.


So anyway, having taken previously 100-150mg to catch a nice buzz, but reading that 25-50mg is usually a good dose, I went with ~50mg. I picked out 2 little crystals in the bag which weighed 56mg... that'll do. 


I tipped the two crystals off the scale, crushed them up into as fine a powder as possible, racked it up, and railed half up each nostril. The burn was less intense as the previous product, again leading me to question it's quality. I felt its' effects come on fairly rapidly, within 3-5 minutes or so, and the nasal burn resided in 60 seconds. In a subtle kind of way, my mood changed to be quite intense, I felt quite serious. Focused. Meticulous. Attentive. I wouldn't call it a rush, but there was a definite buzz. My pulse didn't increase, but my palms got noticeably sweaty. 


I didn't really have much planned for the afternoon so I bumped some hip hop classics and just enjoyed the vibe. It was certainly better than the previous product had ever achieved. I was casually flicking back over the reviews from site that I sourced it from and read that somebody had counted out more Etizolam than they had ordered. I had a momentary thought.... what if I also received more Etizolam than I ordered? So in this heightened state, I decided to open up the bag and count them. Each and every 1,243 of them as it turns out. Bonus! I counted them quite frantically, yet attentively and meticulously. 


The effects lasted for quite a surprisingly long time and I actually really enjoyed it. I have always steered away from stims in the past, and gone for downers (mainly valium & oxycodone) because of my heart palpation problems - but I was pleasantly surprised with this. I've not actually read too much about tolerance so I don't know if this is much of an issue with Ephylphenidrate?


**[End of Review]**


Either way, I'm really happy that I decided to re-order from a different supplier, I really enjoyed it and will certainly enjoy it's use in the future!

I was a fan of EPH powder initially, it was the first RC I tried. I enjoyed snorting Ritalin I like it a lot, so obviously EPH seemed like the next best thing.

I've just seen on another vendor selling Synthacaine, and they actually state this on their description - ***"the most interesting formulation of "Synthacaine" on the market. Our  Synthacaine powder contains Methiopropamine and 2-aminoindane in the  perfect ratio for fascinating laboratory research opportunities."***

Ordered 1G of Ethylphenidate. I'm approaching it different this time. I think ethylphenidate really shines when you IV it from what I read. I figure as long as I dilute the solution enough I don't see the big deal.

Any advice from IV users?


Please no "ethylphenidate fucked up my nose imagine your veins", comparing IV to insufflation is ridiculous.

hi rybee


I have just came on to post the following, which may be relevant to you


I am also fed up of snorting ethylphenidate. i would spend 3 hours nose blowing after dosing on ethylphendiate.


unfortunatley, i have taken 5* the dosage orally, that i would usually take nasally - and to me, i cant feel a thing.


I only use ethylphendiate on and off, i will not use it tonight up the nose, its too much pain, but i have never plugged anything at all in my life.


I feel this is a "dark" step to take. I honestly wont snort it again, so im either plugging or quitting. but which?


i just cant see a good way of plugging, plus if it burnt my ahole i would cry

I had tried EPH pellets but didn't notice anything.


I do prefer nasal as way of ROA with EPH and most others anyway. I too am now rethinking the strategy, IMO you snorting 100mg per hit is way too much. I realized this myself since I've had a tendency to constantly re-dose and with a lot more than I should be.


As for your situation in work, I can only suggest investing in some good micro scales. Weigh out either 50mg or 100mg doses and take them to work - I have a little Rolson 'money' safe on my keyring and I keep any RC's in there. Then you can just pop off to the toilets and do your hit there. I would suggest weighing out in batches of 50mg accurately on your scales, then in work you can eyeball half the dose and inhale that. At least this way you can be certain you won't be losing track of how much you are taking or dosing.


Also around 25mg shouldn't be too harsh on your nasal cavity (In terms of the burn) - Just snot blow out afterwards, and rinse your nose with a little cold water. Or I find using a mild nasal decongestant helps - usually at weekends if I've enjoyed myself too much! ![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif)

I completely agree and have now realized this.


Unfortunately I had no idea about RC's or legal highs at the time - I stumbled across a head shop website while searching for something to enjoy of a weekend and saw all the crazy 1g blend packets, at fractions of the price of the real stuff so naturally curiosity got the better of me. At this point I wasn't aware of RC's, so I tried some of the legal high blends. Then after more mooching the net, I discovered RC's and vendors and have been scouring forums since.


Bluelight is a God send by the way, I love it. And all this "SWIM" stuff on other forums is enough to drive you crazy! lol

Does alcohol go well with EPH? What difference in effect would it have, say re-dosing 50mg lines during a night alongside consuming alcohol - and I just mean enough alcohol, likes beers of a weekend in the house not out trying to dissolve your liver at a club etc.

Ethylphenidate/Alcohol combo has been mentioned plenty of times. Do a search.


Mikerwk that's called muscle tension and it's common especially during high doses.


My Ethylphenidate still has not arrived. Probably a good thing but I want to experience that rush fuck.

I imagine that would compound the NE inhibition from the Ethyl resulting in more undesirable side effects, just a guess though. 


Depends what you perceive a rush to be. For me insufflated, initially I feel slightly detatched, lifted and motivated although this quickly passes onto a more empty stimulation. Make sure to space your redoses or suffer more side effects/harsher comedown.

I switched to oral dosing since its like sniffing powdered battery acid, I do seem to experience some negative effects which are being intensified because im on effexor which is also a norep inhibitor.Also at 4am this morning my nostrils completely swoll shut and i had pressure in my head it was like being all congested my teeth ached from the pressure, managed to get rid of it by drinknig a coffee i had no decongestants or anything and the coffee seemed to boost my high and make it more euphoric and this was around 8am 4 hours since the last dose.


As for oral dosing my stomach was uncomfortable until i smoked a joint.

The only time my teeth got sore was when my head got vasoconstriction and all my fucking teeth hurt, soon as i got rid of that i felt fine.As for coffee well after drinking one this morning while still on eph i got tightness in chest and rapid heartbeat, i had to take some kratom.

I rather like EPH over other stims I have access to like a-pvp or MPA.  EPH seems to provide the best euphoria from the ones I have used without as much extreme stimulation and/or anxiety such as I get with a-pvp.  I am no chemist but from the little i gleam on wikipedia EPH has a higher affinity with Dopamine receptors rather than Norepinephrine receptors.  But i will say that ROA is key at least with my body and experience.  Nasal ROA seem to give me more anxiety.


I know this is kind of weird but hey whatever.  Rectal ROA seem to provide me with the best positive effects (euphoria) and least negative effects (speedy anxiety).  It also appears to be more efficient in term of lower dosage being need to get where you want.  It also does not burn one bit down there.  I know it seems messed up to put stuff up your exit shoot but this is the one and the only one I ROA in that manner just because of the marked difference in it reaction.


Just dissolve your desired amount in small amount of warm water (i use 0.7ml) in a small shot glass or container that has a depression on the bottom.  I usually stay on the lower end around 40mg but i sometimes wander into the 55 or 65 mg range.  Then I use a 1ml oral syringe (no needle lol) and suck up the water thats why a small depression in vessel help since 0.7mls is not much.  Lube up yourself and syringe, lay down on left side, insert, depress, remove, genitally clench muscle in that area to prevent leakage, wait 5 min.  Get up and i am fine for hour or two with good euphoria and very little speediness or anxiety.  Repeat if you want after hour or two, i usually on do it once or twice.  I do keep a supply of benzos around just in case.  i also do sometimes nasal ROA a small quantity (5-10 mg) right after the rectal ROA to get the initial bump.


Side Note:  If you have any opiates on hand the pair well with it.

I found less is more with this stuff, 10mg dissolved in a drink is just a nice amount for me, little fiendish urge to redose, but controllable & it's stronger than an energy drink. 20mg+ & it's hard to stop myself going for more.

Please help, does anyone have pictures of aprox what 120mg in crushed crystal would be for snorting or could someone please upload that amount so I have a general idea? I may have taken too much and do not have a scale so have had to guess on a 25gram bag I had sent to me and I am in a rural area of the Philippines right now with no place to purchase a scale. I realize this is completely unwise in using something or trying something without even knowing the amount you are taking. I am kindly asking please someone if they can give me an approximation or take the time to upload a picture of that amount in a crushed crystal for snorting. It just may save my life, I was feeling good at first but am not feeling well right now and the nearest hospital from this area is 3 hours away plus very unreliable in this country. I would have a heart attack and die before ever making it there lol No Joke - Please if someone can take the time to direct me to a picture or upload one it would be so much to me as I just did a line about 45mins ago and may have taken way too much. I was guessing it was 120mg but that is all I can do based on the 25gram bag. Please help. Thanks

Hi, Lady_Islands.


"Eyeballing" doses flies in the face of harm reduction, and cheap milligram scales can be purchased online, so I recommend that you get one. Because crystals and clumps of powder have a tendency to sometimes look identical and yet weigh very differently, it's pointless and reckless to put up a photo for people to use as a guide.


Be careful, I found ethylphenidate very moreish, and 25g is never good to have around. lol

Hi Lady Islands, you seem to be in quite some distress, so what I'll do for you is measure out 120mg in crystal eph and then crush it an make it into a line so that it'll give you an idea as to how much you should be taking.


If you give me 20 minutes, would that be okay? How does that sound?

I realize this is completely unwise in using something or trying something without even knowing the amount you are taking. I am kindly asking please someone if they can give me an approximation or take the time to upload a picture of that amount in a crushed crystal for snorting. It just may save my life, I was feeling good at first but am not feeling well right now and the nearest hospital from this area is 3 hours away plus very unreliable in this country. I would have a heart attack and die before ever making it there lol No Joke - Please if someone can take the time to direct me to a picture or upload one it would be so much to me as I just did a line about 45mins ago and may have taken way too much. I was guessing it was 120mg but that is all I can do based on the 25gram bag. Please help. Thanks

Trying to judge doses based upon eyeballing quantities doesn't work and cannot be trusted at all because one person may have more or less dense powder, the line can be of varying thicknesses etc.


Besides, if you've taken too much ethylphenidate you've taken too much, and knowing how much you've taken isn't going to change anything.... you'll just have to wait it out.


Bluelight is not an emergency help board so don't bump your posts over and over and over and over, either.

It's all about the purity. I've had many different batches, and my current is over 98.9 percent pure and 99 percent disomer. Can't even feel it it you snort it. Amazing. 10 mg does what 30 of most stuff does

0.5g landed today and Oh Sweet Jesus I finally got that cokey euphoria. 

Incidentally, I've been using/chronically abusing MPA for months and the best MPA I ever had looked, smelled, tasted and felt identical to EPH - a possible labelling error has had me feinding for MPA like that for months.


Oral: meh, mild CNS effects and a lot of PNSs.

Nasal is nowhere near as painful as reported! Dry powder gives a kick, sure, but dissolved in a NaCl/H2O2/H2O solution and squirted nasally is infinitely better!

Say when your washing it out, by pulling the water in one nostril and out of the other. But please, explain why those three compounds are what you prefer, if you don't mind.

Anti-bacteriostatic and reduces to H2O up there.

Was more of a test really - one nostril got tap water/EPD and became corroded. Other one (Per./salt/water) is in perfect condition, and actually mucus free. :D

Edit

[OK sorry I'm new at posting here I guess I should have quoted the person I was addresses back on the previous page or so asking about cutting EPH with Lidocaine .  Sorry this post sounds out of place.]


Just an FYI and this maybe well known by you guys or not really matter but I figured I would put it out there for HR sakes.


Lidocaine is many times mixed with I believe Epinephrine. My understanding the reason is because they both work to help reduce blood flow to the injection site so incisions done using the combo bleed less and thus make the work site easier.  I also believe Lidocaine alone does reduce blood flow to the injection site but just not as much as the combo.  I do not have the hard facts on this but I was explained this by a Plastic Surgeon who did hand surgeries a lot and he said they never use Lidocaine because of that blood flow restriction in a small appendage like a finger.


Also i found a source that kind match what i was told:

Hey guys, I've got a ew quick questions if anyone can help with any of them!


**1)** What other RC's have people used that are similar in effects to Ethylphenidate? I actually do enjoy it now, but I'm keen to look into trying alternative products. I do take Amitriptyline so am a little cautious of anything that strongly inhibits the re-uptake of serotonin, due to the improbable, yet possible, onset of serotonin syndrome.


**2)** Has anyone tried 'Ethylphenidate Glass'? I've just seen it as a new product listed on one of the UK's largest RC vendors, but there's not much product information about the product, only that..


> Ethylphenidate Glass said:

>

> — Ethylphenidate Glass said:

I very much doubt that the higher price, in comparison to rock crystals and powders, is due to its higher purity. Probably owing more to the fact that it 'looks cool'. Which, IMO, is the same reason as to why larger Ethylphenidate rock/crystals are more expensive than the powder form. I've used both powder and rock crystals and have never been able to notice any difference at all.


**3)** How does Ethylphenidate's ROA of oral ingestion and anal plugging differ? I've only ever really snorted it, but have a nasty cold at the moment and am very congested. If I changed to oral/anal would I need to alter the dosage to compensate for the different ROA?


**4)** In terms of its' effects, how does Ethylphenidate actually compare to Methylphenidate/Ritalin? 


**5)** Does anybody else's vision get affected by using Ethylphenidate? My pupils dilate a little, and my eyesight is terrible so I have to wear glasses 24/7 which is kinda annoying.


Any responses to any of those questions would be warmly appreciated! Thanks! ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

@Rybee 

I've seen the 'glass' advertised, I think it's simply to attract the Meth crowd whom are used to large crystals of glass/ice.


Comparable RC's to EPD are limited, given EPD is *the* euphoric stimulant on the market. MPA is fantastic as a purely functional stimulant, there is no recreational potential in it. Nm-2ai is of a different character to EPD, a strange serotonin modulating mixer drug, by my account, whereas EPD is a pure, dopaminergic, typical stimulant.


ROA makes a massive difference with EPD - oral is a waste compared to nasal. Yet, nasal can't compare to vaped.


Compared to MPD? Hmmm, I think I'd take MPD if given the choice, it's much less scatty, more focused.

Yeah, the entire family (lidocaine, larocaine, nitracaine, cocaine etc.,) are all potent vasoconstrictors. Alongside the obvious blocking of nociceptors.

Epinephrine has the same effect, and constricts certain blood vessels, though it can do the opposite in certain situations, it depends on the receptor.


Though the point about additional vasoconstriction is a very valid one.

Plus, even if the area is numbed, it's still being damaged...

I was doing small bumps of this stuff yesterday evening. I couldn't have been more than 5mg a bump and only about 4 or 5 times total. My sinus cavities are giving me hell right now although not bleeding at the moment, just very dry and stuffy and harder than usual to breathe normally. I would not recommend anyone snorting this chemical. Even when used sparingly it seems this route of admission causes considerable damage to the nasal passageways. Although I enjoy it as a functional stimulant I would not risk permanent damage to my nose in attempt to chase a euphoria/rush.

They should sell this stuff as unwanted nose hair remover lol.


In all seriousness, pretty decent buzz that lasts a while orally/plugged and an okay rush when snorted. Would rate it 6.5/10, with pure coke being 10/10

3,4-CTMP (3,4-dichloromethylphenidate) belongs to Ritalin family, in fact it is the strongest member of the clan when it comes to potency but not everyone likes its long-acting properties (a 20mg dose lasts 4 to 6 hours). It's the best functional stim I know of (me is old and knows lots of stims lol) and unlike other intermediate-acting stims this one does procure some nice, warm, mellow euphoria as the -rather long- onset settles in. Not the mega-rush one gets with EPH but it also spares one from many of the untoward effects of EPH and MPH. If your need is to feel pleasant and hyper-productive mentally then this is for you. 


**IMPORTANT SAFETY PRECAUTION **Fast-acting benzos such as temazepam (best choice because it's the only benzo that is both very strong and fact-acting), alprazolam, triazolam and etizolam are recommended to mitigate the untoward effects of any stim, essentially by lowering blood pressure and reversing panicky moods. As for olanzapine it kills the buzz (good or bad) by drastically lowering dopamine levels very quickly, within minutes the trip is over. 3,4-CTMP has no effects on serotonin, like most clean stims it only bothers with dopamine.**** 


> **2)** Has anyone tried 'Ethylphenidate Glass'? I've justDue to its potency 3,4-CTMP should only be taken when potent benzos and/or new-generation antipsychotics (olanzapine is preferred) are immediately available to you if you overindulge. Fast seen it as a new product listed on one of the UK's largest RC vendors, but there's not much product information about the product, only that..
> 		
> Click to expand...


I take it the "glass" means the EPH is in clear crystal form instead of the yellowish shade encountered in most crystalized EPH. Looks better but as far as being purer or more potent I reserve my judgement.


> I very much doubt that the higher price, in comparison to rock crystals and powders, is due to its higher purity. Probably owing more to the fact that it 'looks cool'.

Dunno, here the crystal form is the same price as the powder. Last order I received in September was 10g and comprised both yelloywish rocks and clear crystals, I mean really clear, like glass. Both had the exact same effects though, and the same horrible taste (last time I do the taste test on EPH I swear) In China there is a fierce competition between pharmaceutical labs that produce drugs for the RC market so it's not in their interest to provide lower quality than the next lab, although looks can differ.

>

Use half an oral dose when plugging and be careful to inject the anal solution no deeper than two inches beyond the anus while keeping your butt in the air for 3 to 5 minutes, most rewarding yoga session you'll ever get. %)%) Expect quick onset if done properly and, amazingly, it doesn't burn at all. 


> **4)** In terms of its' effects, how does Ethylphenidate actually compare to Methylphenidate/Ritalin?
> 		
> Click to expand...


Theoretically methylphenidate should be slightly stronger but that would only apply if pure methylphenidate was available. Snorting or plugging crushed Ritalin IR tablets you draw all those binders and fillers in your body along with the MPH, while EPH come in much purer form and in the end EPH provides a better ride. But even if methylphenidate was available in base form the differences between EPH and MPH are so subtle that telling one form the other in a blind test would likely prove futile.

> Click to expand...


Well this probably not the answer you were looking for but I wear my contact lenses for days on end when doing stims otherwise that nasty stim sweat that builds up on the eyelids drips into my eyes and it stings like a sonovabitch. Eyeglasses can't protect us unfortunately otherwise I would wear mine instead of lenses.

so yeah after a long break from doing this stuff weekly to once in a blue moon i got half a G with 25 flubromazepams. TOP TIP: flubros are the best benzo for EPH long term use, i dropped 16mg of flubro at 1pm then started on the EPH first a few lines, jesus i forgot how much it hurts haha.


so i preceded with eyeballing bombs of roughly 50 to 100mgs could b way off, unsure if i got gram or half a gram as my vendor can be generous sometimes. ive had 3 bombs and been productively busy all day practicing my DJing in all forms and genres, had a great day.


But anyway no desire to have anymore flubros, i have alot of EPH left, about 800mgs of codeine and lots of weed.


overall the day hasnt been perticual euphoric, its just been really fun and interesting, talking to old freinds, getting some well needed DJ practice in. just a good day.


i plan on taking all the codeine now (i have a huge tolerance im fine dont worry) smoke some weed pop some more flubros just to get the nod going then hopefully off to sleep.


peacee

Will the pure innocent insufflating souls finally see the light at the end of the tunnel my dear lad? The light being the anus through which EPH enters the tunnel of euphoric glory, a celestial place void of sinister sinusonic horror tales. Preach my friend, pray for redemption of the dammed! 


Seriously if everyone that snorts EPH plugged it instead some ORL departments would be seriously depleted of patients with tortured septums and suppurating sinuses. It doesn't burn at all down there. Dunno why but it doesn't. Small dose goes a long way too. 2 cents less in my pocket ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Anybody find any tolerance issues with EPH? I'm only an occasional user of it - so haven't noticed any issues with tolerance so far. Just wondered whether I should expect it, if I were to carry on taking it?

Just like any other NDRI, usage will eventually build tolerance unless you're taking it at quite small doses (10-20mg) and infrequently (less than once a day).

**@ Rybee** yes tolerance builds reasonbly quickly, up to a certain amount i find (not sure eactly what amount, because i usually dab and sublingual) but the rate at which i increase the doses slows down, i presume towards 100mg max (eyeballed+ crystals , can't be exctly sure), but above that dose i get side - effects like headaches, and  more edgyness, not relly anxiety, but i do take benzos...


It's so fiendish though as a drug, i usually binge when i have some, and dab as soon as i feel the come-down creeping up.

Oops. Sorry folks but I just inadvertently deleted this post of mine (strike two I guess) and I'm now too dead tired at this time to launch into that again.Suffice it to say that at at some point a miniature Schnauzer inserted iselfin a hospitalI was employed at but that I didn't believe it at first until I became the only indvidualto get bitten by it. It bore the name Sissyfus and that's the right spelling.I fondly disliked him. Mods, is there a way toremove this post please?

 Ja,massively more than just MPH. Was similar to insufflated cokeI'd say but cravings were more physical in nature. Hand tremors during wd, hindered driving and manual work for 5-7 days.,really.

Other than needing more for the same results, no. Even then, I find sometimes less is more. My ROA is always insufflation and I think above 60-65mg your nostril won't hold anymore powder. Along with that, I split lines between nostrils and don't bother with doing more than 85mg total (42.5/42.5 split) at once, I think only side effects increase above that with negligible increases in positives

I really don't understand why people are son fond of this shitty stuff while we have potentially very promising stuff as 2-FA which permits me to obtain some really good grade at school (And It's for going a MD) so... I assume though that we need to investigate in stuffs like 2-fa, that's the main reason that led me to stuff using it. But anyway I really can't get why you prefer this one excepting the fact that it's quite easier to obtain it.

I really liked this stuff but the come-down was awful so I threw away the 0.5g I had left.


Positives: Euphoria, concentration, easy to talk to people, happy, lasts 2 hours or so

Negatives(come down): Shaking, anxiety, difficulty breathing, paranoia...

I find if I dose 75-100mg and drink it throughout my day at work (7-8hrs) I feel in a good mood and way more motivated and the work day goes by way faster. More practical and functional than dexedrine. No come down either or insomnia taking it this way.


This stuff Is pretty euphoric snorted or taking a large dose at once oral or plugged but when you do this I get the weird paranoia and come down sucks.

WHat makes you say this, I had read a few reports of 2-FA being superior, though for what purpose I don't remember. Gimme the rundown. I've had 2-FMA many times, 2-FA none.

Holy fuck.

The difference between insufflating an EPD solution and the dry powder is ridiculous!

While the pain is, in my opinion, exaggerated on the forum, the dry powder feels like snorting glass - though it only lasts 30 seconds or so. The pain was felt not just in the nose, but the whole way along the sinus cavity - burning underneath the ear and even further still!


Seriously: a solution of EPD and Saline administered nasally is infinitely less painful, alongside being absorbed faster and more efficiently.

I'd like to share some of my experiences of ethylphenidate over the last couple of weeks. I originally purchased it intending to take something like 3 doses of 10-20mg per day to improve concentration and motivation (treat ADHD symptoms). I have used it in this way for a couple of days and it did seem to be fairly effective. But that's the only experience I managed to get with that kind of use because I've basically abused the shit out of it for 2 weeks and used 5 grams.


Anyway, here are some observations, some of which are to be expected, and some of which were surprising to me:


0: Plugging is the way to go, if you're after recreational effects. The bioavailability is supposed to be around 5x higher than oral, and it comes on about twice as fast. (Start feeling the effects in just over 5 minutes, full effects after 25 minutes). I'm not sure what the potency is like with snorting, since I'm not using that method any more, but done that way it starts kicking in in a couple of minutes and seems to be at full effect in 10-15 mins. But the feeling from snorting is significantly different, consisting of an extremely brief rush lasting 5-10 minutes and then a fairly rapid, annoying comedown. (more on comedown later).


1: It's extremely fiendy. The first time I decided to try "one snort, just to see what it's like recreationally" I was up for 2 days and was completely unable to control the urge to redose.


2: It can provide some fairly nice euphoria, especially when plugged. But this lasts only about half an hour, and after about 3 redoses the euphoria disappears but the compulsion to redose is just as strong.


3: Tolerance builds up very quickly. In my first experiments with plugging the stuff 10mg would give a fairly decent buzz. 2 weeks later of use about every 3 days or so and my first dose of a session will probably be 60mg.


4: Cardiovascular effects - It doesn't seem to affect heart rate all that much, but it definitely feels like my heart is beating harder and my blood pressure is high. I have a stethoscope so I've been listening to my heart, but I don't have a BP cuff so I can't actually measure that. No problematic cardiac effects have been noticed by auscultation, apart from stronger than usual beats - no palpitations or other arrhythmias noticed.


5: Vasoconstriction - Pretty bad with this one, and from reports people have said it's worse than a lot of other stims (though I couldn't say since stims aren't really my thing and I don't have much experience with them. After taking a couple of hundred milligrams over the course of a few hours my feet and fingers are freezing, but I haven't seen any particular danger signs such as numbness or discolouration. This is something I have to watch out for as I have type 1 diabetes so I'm already at risk from circulation issues in the extremities. Also my penis shrinks down to the size of a really shrivelled-looking thumb. I did try at one time taking 50mg of Sildenafil, mainly as an experiment to see if it would address the shrinkage problem, but it didn't seem to have any effect. Which is annoying, because...


6: Sexual effects - it tends to increase sexual desire and arousal, like many stimulants. But it also has a strong anorgasmic effect. Combined with the tiny cock problem, if you try to do anything with the arousal I hope you have better success than me, because trying to get something to happen for 6 hours and then giving up is pretty frustrating.


7: Hunger pangs - this is a weird one, and something I wouldn't have expected. I wasn't surprised to feel this on my first try with the stuff because I pretty much didn't eat anything for 24 hours. But even if if I've made sure to eat, an hour later I'm suddenly faced with a really powerful hunger that can almost make me feel sick.


8: Dry mouth - can get pretty bad, but I don't recommend constantly drinking water (which only gets rid of the dryness for a few seconds and is probably putting unhealthy levels of water into your system considering the reduction in urine elimination caused by most stimulants including this one.) Instead, I find that sucking on a hard candy completely eliminates the dry mouth, although it's probably really bad for your teeth. Maybe try a sugar free candy, although be careful as these tend to have laxative effects. But this might actually come in handy because...


9: Constipation - This stuff definitely slows that whole area down, and even if you feel the need to take a poop, you'll probably just sit there for ten minutes waiting in vain.


10 Cognitive effects: This is what I got the stuff for, and it definitely seems promising in low doses. But in high doses it has weird effects. The 2 main problems I have from ADHD are A: Motivation to begin tasks, and B: Maintaining concentration on a task. At the 10-20mg oral level it seems to improve both. But at more recreational doses, it massively ramps up A, while doing nothing to help B (usually). This means I've tended to spend hours and hours going from one thing to another on the internet, learning really interesting things about the most random topics, but being completely unable to consciously direct my actions to a specific task. In a way it actually seems to make that part of the ADHD far worse. I end up with 5 browser windows open with 50 tabs each, with the most random information in each one. This is actually quite fun, except when I think about a need to do a specific thing and am frustrated that I just can't seem to do it without getting massively distracted. At one point though, I did experience the opposite effect, when I became obsessed with one particular task for a while and I just couldn't drop it. (This post is taking me absolutely ages to write because I'm doing about 100 other things at the same time.)


11: Compulsivity. I've already mentioned the compulsion to redose, but this drug massively amplifies my sensorimotor compulsivity, which I already have normally to a small degree but which I usually keep well under control. But on this drug, I'm writhing my body, making constant loud breathing sounds, breathing in strange patterns, humming songs, rocking backwards and forwards, rolling my eyes... I must look totally mental. Pleasantly surprising, though, is the fact that it doesn't worsen my slight dermatillomania. In fact it seems to completely cure it. Who'da thunk?


12: (I came back after the last bit of the post to put something here but I can't remember what it was so I'll put): Muscular tightness. Pretty much a hazard of all stims, and since I'm not that experienced with other stims, I can't really make a comparison. But subjectively it does seem quite bad, my back muscles in particular are very tense, though I can relax them if I consciously do so.


And lastly (I've probably forgotten a lot of things I wanted to mention, I'll come back to them if I remember)


13 (appropriate): The Comedown. Oh God, the comedown. It's really really unpleasant. As the drug wears off it seems that the dopamine effects disappear but the noradrenergic effects are still in full force. This leaves me with a pounding heart, ice cold fingers and toes, feeling very anxious and unpleasantly stimulated. I would not want to take this substance without benzos being available. Etizolam has been great in reducing the comedown symptoms and allowing sleep.


Hope at least someone found this useful or interesting. Like I say, I probably forgot a load of stuff, I'll try to come back and add stuff if I remember.

ive been on this new EPH glass thats just appeared on the market and i got to say even tho it is slightly more expensive it is lot nicer.


when crushed fully, theres no pain just a slight sting then its gone.


smaller doses required, defiantly more positive than negative effects, still i can assure the comedown will just be as unpleasant.


overall it feels cleaner and more potent so highly recommended if buying powder/crystal stuff

Anyone have any suggestions for sleeping the day you take this stuff without etiz or a benzo? I find even if I take a dose (30mg insufflated) at 3pm, I still find it quite difficult to fall asleep around 10pm even if I feel tired I just can't fall asleep and when I do I have a very restless sleep.

Yeah. You take less, or take it earlier. And stop insuffulating it, it's horrible for your nose. Plug it.

Almost every person who snorted it, even if they had 0 problems at first, they regretted it. It fucked them up, and the damage was cumulative. You've had fair warning, take it orally or rectally, stop snorting it.

QFT - Sooo much better than oral.


I haven't noticed any damage at all, but I've only done it maybe 5x using a solution and rinsing right after. I suppose I will try plugging since I don't want to dissolve my septum.

I've seen it all in a very clear crystal form either in huge clear shards or more powdery - it wasn't really different in effects. I never snorted it... I found vaping it quite moreish and am through with the stuff.

If you are gonna snort this stuff, dilute it, I would recommend 100mg/ml MAXIMUM strength concenrtration and then squirt it in your nose away from your septum or use a nasal spray bottle thing. let it sit for like 5 minutes and then use a saline nasal rinse to clean it out. I would assume about 50-75% of the chemical goes down your throat with this method but you still get some in your nose and get a bit of a rush combined with the duration of doing it orally.


Doing this SIGNIFICANTLY reduces damage to the nasal cavity. I still wouldn't be using like 50mg/day in each nostril but I have been doing like. 10mg per nostril 2-3x per day for like a week and have noticed literally no damage, pain, bleeding, and the burn isn't bad at all when it's diluted.

Just put 20mg in a glass of juice & drink it... don't do lines of ethylphenidate it's dumb, there's no rush, it's not a good drug & it'll eat straight through your face. It works well orally in small doses, it's absorbed quickly. I think you'd have to be mad to try sniffing/smoking/vaporizing or plugging this.

No prob, just thought you should know how you're coming off.


As for the vision problem... it only goes wonky after days of no sleep but that goes for any psycho-stimulant and I haven't a fucking clue why, but it is a sign that stuff is moving in a Southernly direction. 


Highly doubt it's from mere hypertension, there have got to be some old geezers out there with a horrible vascular system and 30/20 vision.

Ironic to say this whilst I'm quoting you... But no, I don't think so - though don't quote me on it!


As far as I'm aware, Ethylphenidate can only be formed as a product of *in vivo* metabolisation. I'm sure I read before that it was based on the same principle as Cocaethylene being formed *in vivo* when a user consumes alcohol and takes Cocaine simultaneously.

Oral is definitely best. It provides exactly what I at least, need from time to time - a "lovely, smooth, warm buzz that lasts" and right now I am into hour 5 of an oral dose 50mg. This thread is replete with warnings about snorting this stuff. Look at it this way...once you lose an eye, it is gone, forever. No one knows yet the exact nature of long term use insufflating this stuff, but the short term is amply reflected in this forum. Don't snort.

It can be safe snorted I haven't had much pain or problems, get a cap full of water to dip ur finger in and inhale as many drops as you need for whatever nostrils you are using, snort lines, then 10/15 later use a straw to inhale more water and drip it to clear everything out, I like to keep my nostrils moist while I do it by using my finger to add a few drops to my nose gets rid if the dry feeling.

Diluting it with water or saline makes nasal admin easier, but it still stings & seems to block my nose for days, I just dissolved about 50mg in a few ml, got half left & going to throw it away. A saline nasal spray is handy. I don't think there's any eph rush to chase & it's dirst cheap, which makes nasal even less sensible.


I even get a bit of a burn if I cap & swallow it.


Adding it to a fruit juice & drinking it seems best. It works quickly, same effects, no pain.

Still get idiots posting about how they did lines of it & damaged their nose, so clearly not enough warnings. Maybe it needs 500 or 600 or 1000 warnings before it starts to sink in.

Is it really worth it, FG?

I mean, *really*?

It's physically very harmful. Corrosive as fuck.

I know how powerful addiction is, but really - is that brief high (and the poly-substance use to make the comedown tolerable worth the risk + harm + polydrug addiction reinforcement?


Have you tried taking a couple of months away from the stuff to reassess what the pros and cons really are?

I don't think any of us can make a clear judgement whilst in the process of using this stuff, but I tell you - when I stopped taking it, I knew there'd be no turning back.

With the benefit of hindsight, I'd say this is one of the shittiest drugs I've ever taken. Well, in the top  (bottom?) 10 anyway.  But that's not what I though when I was using it.

I never snorted it either.  I shudder at the thought.  

Be safe kids.  Take care of those delicate sinus tissues, they don't like highly corrosive chemicals searing into them, if this thread is anything to go by.

Surely there are other dopaminergic stimulants available that aren't so physically damaging?

Your posts scare me a bit foolsgold. I don't mean to sound patronising, but your seem resigned to this self destructive path.  Please take care, man.

I can't tell whether you mean hopefully you get back in time to sign for another package of eph or not? 


Spacejunks advice is gold.


And I agree, in hindsight I'd never buy this shit again. It's so harsh on the body even when not snorted.... uncomfortable. But when it's running through you it doesn't matter. 


There *are* better dopiminergic stimulants that seem less harsh... but I don't know if they would be more or less dangerous with the type of binges you seem to go on.

EPH is very highly soluble in water, i used to sublingual, i'm not dumb enough to snort the stuff especially given i need rather high dosages...plugged is as strong if not more strong than snorted or S/L and lasts waaaaaaaaaaaay longer than snorted,like 4-5+ times as long, maybe twice as long as S/L...


Yes its a bit  iffy and unpleasant to plug... when i couldn't hit a vein with morphine after multiple pokes, i would resort to plugging as it is the next highest B-A, so i know how to do it "right"...


My gf sometimes takes a teeny tiny amount of EPH to "get going", and will snort which is OK, BUT if you want to get any mood lift/euphoria, plugging is the way to go, fuck nosebleeds, and desytroying your nasal cavity, it's so caustic, i even got badass chemical burn tongue from S/L EPH...


U just got to plug corretly... stuffs better than IR Ritalin IMO when plugged right....

Eh Dex is better overall. from start and comedown. EPH is much shorter with a MORE twisted comedown. some like it. some don;t


But EPH has a better rush and a nicer high/peak doesn't last too long (which can be good sometimes) re dosing is a bitch with this one. less for giving than aPVP or MDPV though


miss it. kinda like it in low oral doses only. snorting is waste for your nose, and oral works really well

In PG/VG in a standard vapouriser. 

The difference is remarkable - akin to coke vs crack.

Hey All,


I seem to be reacting very differently to EPH since I started taking 75mg of Nortriptyline (a Tricyclic Antidepressant) I'm taking for neuropathic pain. It's started making me anxious/nervous/jittery/twitchy/panicy when used in relatively small doses (50mg insufflated), after several months use without any problems. 


Do you think that these side effects could be caused by the fact that they both inhibit the re-uptake of Dopamine, as well as Norepinephrine to a lesser extent? Nortriptyline has the following binding affinity (ki[nM]):


Dopamine: 3100 ki[nM]

Serotonin: 16.5 ki[nM]

Norepinephrine: 4.37ki[nM]


I used to take 100mg intranasally with no problems, some times using it multiple times per day. But now, even one hit of 50mg is making me feel awful (during each of the last 3 times), and each time I used it, I soon reached for some Propranolol, Diazepam and Oxycodone to calm down and subdue the jitters.


If it's not the Nortriptyline causing it, I can't think why else this would just start happening to me? Does my Nortriptyline 'theory' stack up, or can somebody prove it wrong and rule it out? It's a shame it's happening, because a little dab of EPH every now and then was very useful in waking me up and getting me going for the day.


I do have some MPA, but I'm not willing to try that until I figure out what's going on.

Since writing the aforementioned post and having just searched for drug interactions using various online services, I got the following information: 


[www.reference.medscape.com/drug-interactionchecker](http://www.reference.medscape.com/drug-interactionchecker) pulled up the following information when I checked for interactions between Nortriptyline and **M**ethylphenidate (using Methylphenidate as Ethylphenidate is not listed):


**3 Interactions Found With *Nortriptyline* + *Methylphenidate***


**Serious Interaction - Use Alternatives**

Possible serious or life-threatening interaction. Monitor closely. Use alternatives if available. 

Comment: Tricyclic antidepressants increase or decrease effects of sympathomimetics, by blocking reuptake of NE, or blocking uptake of indirect sympathomimetics into the adrenergic neuron.


**Significant Interaction - Monitor Closely**

Nortriptyline increases sedation and Methylphenidate decreases sedation. Effect of interaction is not clear, use caution. Potential for interaction, monitor closely.


**Minor Interaction**

Methylphenidate increases effects of Nortriptyline by decreasing metabolism. Minor or non-significant interaction.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


[http://www.drugs.com/interactions-check.php](https://www.drugs.com/interactions-check.php) pulled up the following information when I checked for interactions between Nortriptyline and **M**ethylphenidate (using Methylphenidate as Ethylphenidate is not listed):


**Moderate Interaction**

MONITOR: The coadministration with Methylphenidate may increase the serum concentrations of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs). Case reports involving primarily Methylphenidate and Imipramine have suggested favourable as well as unfavourable clinical effects from this combination. In vitro studies suggest that Methylphenidate may inhibit the metabolism of Imipramine and other TCAs, although the extent is probably subject to considerable interindividual variation.


MANAGEMENT: Pharmacologic response to TCAs should be monitored more closely whenever Methylphenidate (racemic) or Dexmethylphenidate (the more pharmacologically active d-enantiomer) is added to or withdrawn from therapy, and the TCA dosage adjusted as necessary.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


[www.webmd.com/interaction-checker](http://www.webmd.com/interaction-checker) pulled up the following information when I checked for interactions between Nortriptyline and **M**ethylphenidate (using Methylphenidate as Ethylphenidate is not listed):


**Serious - Use Alternative**

Potential for serious interaction; regular monitoring by your doctor required or alternate medication may be needed. Tricyclic antidepressants may increase or decrease the effect of the other drug when taken in this combination


**Significant - Monitor Closely**

Potential for interaction. Nortriptyline oral increases and Methylphenidate decreases sedation and drowsiness.


**Minor**

Methylphenidate increases effects of Nortriptyline oral by slowing drug metabolism


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


[http://umm.edu/health/medical/drug-interaction-tool](http://umm.edu/health/medical/drug-interaction-tool) pulled up the following information when I checked for interactions between Nortriptyline and **M**ethylphenidate (using Methylphenidate as Ethylphenidate is not listed):


**High Interaction Potential - Use Alternative**

Treatment with both an amphetamine-like agent and a Tricyclic antidepressant may result in high blood pressure, and other effects on your heart and your nervous system. Using an amphetamine-like agent together with a Tricyclic antidepressant may cause an increased risk of certain side effects, but using both drugs may be the best treatment for you. 


Some examples of an amphetamine-like agent are Dextroamphetamine, Methylphenidate, or Phentermine. Examples of a Tricyclic antidepressant are Amitriptyline, Amoxapine, or Imipramine. If you are using both medicines together, your doctor may change the dose or how often you use one or both of the medicines. If you are already using an amphetamine-like agent and a Tricyclic antidepressant, call your doctor if you feel dizzy or Lightheaded, feel tired, have a headache, or have a faster than usual heart beat. Do not stop using your medicines without talking to your doctor first.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


[http://www.cvs.com/drug/interaction-report](http://www.cvs.com/drug/interaction-report) pulled up the following information when I checked for interactions between Nortriptyline and **M**ethylphenidate (using Methylphenidate as Ethylphenidate is not listed):


**Moderate Interaction**

These drugs must be used together with close monitoring by your health care provider. Side effects may occur such as high blood pressure or fast heart rate, nervousness, palpitations, problems with sleep, severe headache, or other side effects.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


[http://healthtools.aarp.org/drug-interactions](http://healthtools.aarp.org/drug-interactions) pulled up the following information when I checked for interactions between Nortriptyline and **M**ethylphenidate (using Methylphenidate as Ethylphenidate is not listed):


**Moderate Interaction**

These drugs must be used together with close monitoring by your health care provider. Side effects may occur such as high blood pressure or fast heart rate, nervousness, palpitations, problems with sleep, severe headache, or other side effects. 


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


... So was I right in thinking this is down to the neurotransmitter interactions and I should avoid its use until I come off of the Nortriptyline, which will probably be in January when I change from Nortriptyline and Oxycodone to just Methadone, via my pain management consultant?

Does anyone else here find EPD to provide visuals?

A cursory scouring of the internet reveals I am not alone.

Initially, I assumed it was down to pupil dilation and permanent serotonergic changes due to heavy tripping. 

However, my missus indulged on a few occasions and mentioned the visuals without me letting on about my experience.


The visuals are minor - no Tryptamine dreamscapes, but colour changes, slight morphing, objects coming to life, geometric CEV's etc.,

Yes, you should avoid most stimulants, psychedelics & possibly other drugs too while on tricyclic antidepressants.

on the subject of vaping this shit...

i like smoking my stims and, as anyone who's tried it knows, eph's vapour is horridly acrid smelling/tasting shit; the kind of smell/taste that lingers in your mouth and room for ages.

i've been doing some random experimentation/pseudoscience to see if i can make vaping eph less unpleasant and make it a more viable ROA, though of course only for once-in-a-blue-moon usage as we all know what this shit does to the soft tissues of the mouth and nose. anyway, i've found a way which works pretty well...


the method i've come up with is:


• drop a single drop of water into the bowl of a glass pipe ("oil burner") with a syringe or eyedropper/pipette 

• dissolve in it your dose of EPH

(note: this 'tek' only works for smallish amounts where you can clear the bowl in about 2 big hits. i've used this method with up to 25mg eph with satisfactory results)

• dissolve alongside the EPH a just less than equal amount (in volume of material rather than weight) of MPA 

(with the batch i have at least. i haven't weighed the mpa but volume-wise i can fit a gram of eph into a 1"x1" ziplock and the same amount of this batch of mpa fills 1.5 of these bags)


now the reason for adding in MPA is because from quite a lot of experimentation i have deduced that MPA has a lower melting point than EPH and runs better - generally vapes in a glass pipe a lot nicer and easier. another light stim (light so as to not dilute the EPH experience) or some inactive filler with these same properties may substitute. i haven't looked for an alternative filler material as MPA synergises with EPH anyway (plus the dose of mpa used is tiny anyway) and the not-unpleasant taste/smell of the MPA vapour dilutes that of the EPH vapour.


• take a lighter with a small flame and CAREFULLY (you need to be precise with the temperature and move the lighter away and towards the bowl a lot) evaporate the water while rolling the pipe -- basically evaporating the water and melting down both materials at the same time and spreading it around the bowl and rolling the pipe, leaving you with a very thin layer of oil which - from my experimentation - seems hotspot-free. allow this to recrystallise while rolling the pipe so as to spread out the product thinly and evenly in the bowl.


now i cant verify any of this, as i came up with this method though random experimentation and very basic scientific knowledge, but i believe that dissolving the two materials together (thus mixing them together evenly) and recrystallising them together (one with a higher melting point and one with a lower) results in the overall melting point of the recrystallised material averaging out and effectively-speaking (at least how we are concerned) lowering the melting point of the EPH and thus making it easier to work with. the thin layer widespread in the bowl also seems to reduce any chance of burning anything (as long as you are decently skilled with vaping with a glass pipe). even if this hypothesis is incorrect, in practice this is how it works out.


as for actually smoking, this is done in mostly the same way you'd smoke anything out of one of these pipes (be it MPA or any number of illegals) apart from the initial process of melting down the product.

the method slightly differs as of course even with the eph and mpa evenly mixed together, the mpa is likely to start melting first. i find that you still have to use high temperature - i tend to use a jet lighter for this (which is complete overkill for vaping most things) - but the liquid EPH seems to prevent the MPA from burning at this high temperature which it usually would and the liquid EPH behaves a lot nicer and runs smoother, making it easier to handle and vape. you want to get the bowl quite hot quite quickly and let vapour start being produced before you move the lighter away to a 'safer' distance more like what you would use when vaping meth or something. other than this odd quirk it's the same method as vaping anything in a glass pipe


if you did everything correct (unless my method is specific to the batches of each drug i have) you should notice that the vapour has no real taste and doesn't burn your throat much - still not pleasant but not gag-inducingly grim like EPH vapour usually is, it's actually tolerable and not too unpleasant unlike regular EPH vapour. on the exhale you should be able to smell a hint of both eph and mpa vapour (but neither taste as strong as either of these vaped by themselves) -- i happily note that the eph smell from this does not linger in the room more than 5 minutes and doesn't 'stick' to fabrics and the taste doesn't linger in your mouth or lungs.

loading too much material (at least, too much EPH) in the pipe results in all of the MPA being vaped away before the EPH and any successive hits will probably burn your throat and lungs horribly and make you gag - EPH vapour really is awful - and this (in my experience) also increases the chances of burning some of the EPH, which is both wasteful and tastes/smells fucking awful too. i generally load 25-30mg of EPH and an eyeballed dose of MPA, this allows for 2 hits before the bowl is cleared (leaving no residue, either - EPH on its own always seems to leave this gross oily yellow residue for me. sidenote, MPA never leaves resiude) and results in a lovely rush and a great stim high for a decent amount of time. i have tried this without the first step of dissolving the two materials and then evaporating&recrystallising but it simply does not work properly. the dissolving (or mixing/recrystallising the 2 materials as one) step is seemingly vital


the rush: first felt is the sudden high-dose caffeine-like alertness of the MPA, and after a few seconds the lovely dopaminergic euphoria of the EPH creeps/fades in. within roughly 7 seconds post-exhale you should be left with a content smile and the lovely skin tingling that comes with a vaped eph rush.


through observation the melted mpa seems to help kickstart the melting of the eph - even moreso since the two materials are mixed together in such a way and effectively a single product and heat is distributed between both materials evenly due to this and it being a nice thin and widespread layer.

another note: you would expect that the combination of MPA and EPH would produce a bigger side-effects profile than either chemical alone, but i haven't experienced this at all. other than the alertness of MPA's high effect on adrenaline, the experience feels identical to a normal vaped EPH experience... just without the (literally) gag-inducing acridness of the EPH vapour. i think this may be due to the dose of MPA being rather small and the EPH dose heavily outweighing the MPA.

just thought i'd post some of my findings for any of you lot who may be interested.


HR disclaimer: in no way do i recommend this (especially for people with an affinity towards compulsive behaviour or dosing) because of the obvious reasons of unknown safety/health risks and how fucking god damn corrosive EPH is to soft tissue - this can NOT be good for your lungs. if you are going to do this (or vape EPH at all) please only do it on rare occasions. on top of this, i have no idea whatsoever on whether melting eph and mpa together and recrystallising them together would have any unwanted effects such as creating other (and possibly toxic) compounds - as far as my science knowledge goes i don't think this would happen unless you accidentally combusted some material, but i only have a basic background in science so i'm not qualified to make an assumption about this

Before i start, im from slovenia my english is not perfect ill try my best, any thing i dont know how to spell, will be labled with *


Also note, in slovenia good Rc`s got rooted into our drug arsenal, drugs like mephedrone, 3-mmc and ethylphenidate are sold localy and are up there with drugs like amphetamine sulph, mdma , heroin ect... 


Sooo let me start


Me and a friend wanted to buy sladoled (3-mmc) but the whole towns supply had ran out, and the next re-stock will be in a week,  so we decided* to buy something else... We didnt want Mdma or speed (amph), so my guy asked me if o wanted to try Flamingo (ethylphenidate) i said sure, me and a freind both did a 100mg line, burns as fuck but only for 30 sec not like mephedrone wich* burns for ages. We both started felling the mild stimulation cocaine like but diffrent, my asshole started fell like a warm bubble is forming inside, so we kinda liked it and bought 3g wich* we snorted up in 24 h, the flamingo looked like small squre* almost translucet* hard to brake crystals, during the binge (12+h) we started getting dumb no one wanted to talk we were like emotnly* dead i forgot every second word i said, or heard but i had the felling i understaned everthing we were talking about things that dont seem or are logical, (this never happend on any other stimulant binge, not in this way)  anyway i started tripping a saw my freind to be another person weird fucking stuff.... Any way after the binge i coundt sleep for another 18 h no xanax didnt help, the next morning i found out i got a sinus infection my face had swollen bad stuff, anyway i wont take eph anymore, its a good stimulant in small dosages  for work or study but not worth binging or rushing on it couse you get brain dead, + its bad on the nose burns leas than meph but the damage* is worse. Just my trip.

I've only ever brought pellets (25mg) and after trying them out a few times, along with alcohol, I thought 3 at once and no redosing was decent enough. Never had any problems. I've just had 2 pellets, so 50mg, but been reading on snorting it.. never tried it before and tbh never even thought about it because of the pellet form I buy it in. I've probably only ever done 30 or so pellets in my life so I don't wanna sound like a hardcore user, I very rarely have a couple on top of a couple drinks and thats it.


Whats the advantages/disadvantages of snorting and if I broke down a 25mg pellet what would the effects be in comparison to doing a 3rd pellet swallowed (as I normally do).


Edit; don't worry, after reading a bit from the last few pages I won't bother snorting.. sounds horrifically dangerous. Just makes me curious what its doing to my stomach?

Even timid people can plug, provided adequate privacy. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png) 


> Question 1: if your stim tolerance is at a 2-months-away-from-all-stims baseline level, what dose would you mix up for plugging - if your feeling really generous, the type of info that would answer this question even better, would be some basic guidelines as to the ratio of liquid (in ml) for said dose (I usually dose orally in the 35-50mg range) - if I feel ok handling, say, a 50mg dose, how much liquid should I inject with that dose?
> 		
> Click to expand...


If your stim tolerance is baseline plugging 50mg ETH is probably not a good idea. Personally I always dose with 20mg ETH/10ml water.  


> Question 2: should a rectal dose be the same as I'd use orally? - I've read that the rectal roa comes with increased bioavailability, so I'm just curious and, in the interest of HR, don't want to overdo it
> 		
> Click to expand...


Rule of thumb (which has no scientific value other than personal observation through experience) is 1x oral = 0.4x rectal. In other words a dose for plugging amounts to 40% of an oral dose to achieve desired effect. Some use even less.       


> Question 3: I usually dissolve mine in a shot glass of Gatorade, then chase the foul first shot with a couple more gulps of Gatorade to wash the goodies out of my mouth and down to my tummy (works great, btw) - the question is: do you dissolve the rectal dose in plain water? - or would it be better/ok to use Gatorade or perhaps a sterile saline solution?
> 		
> Click to expand...


I use distilled water for peace of mind because tap water in this city has a strong chemical taste but most people I know that use ETH swear that tap water works just as good regardless of taste and smell. As for Gatorade... well it is derived from an oral re-hydration medicine so it should probably be restricted to oral use. You never know, there might be ingredients in the drink that could hamper rectal absorbing of EPH. A long shot but why take the chance.         


> Question 4: do you mind going into detail as to your exact rectal injection procedure? - what type/size of syringe is used, what type (if any) of lubricant should used? - how far do you cram it in? - do you lay down on your belly? - or on your side? - or do it 'doggy style' with your bum in the air? - after injection, do you stay in the position for a bit to allow gravity to assist? - do I need to clench the cornhole afterwards and, if so, for how long after injection? - lastly, I read that a clean colon is important - how does one determine if he's cleaned out enough?

**First the hardware:** you will need non-powdered surgical gloves (for sanitary purposes), a 10cc/10ml oral syringe with glass tip or hard plastic tip, the tip should be at least 2.5 inches long (I think that's about 10cm) but no more than 4 inches. Avoid soft plastic tips. One common shot glass for mixing the solution. 1 drinking glass. Lubricated condoms (see below) or, if you're the fancy type, some of that grossly overpriced "personal lubricant"/glorified Vaseline that shall remain unnamed. You can get all of this stuff at Wal Mart or practically any pharmacy.


**Check rectal bulb for clearance**. The bulb is the "entrance hall" that links the colon to the rectum, that's where rectal meds are absorbed. The bulb is usually clear when you don't feel the need to defecate but just in case, use gloved finger to confirm the all-clear. Also get rid of gas, if any. Very frustrating to blow out a fresh dose. 


**Prep the solution**. Grind EPH to fine powder. Weigh 20mg powder and dump into dry clean shot glass. Pour some (ideally lukewarm) water into drinking glass. Suck water into syringe to full mark (assuming syringe is 10cc/10ml). Empty syringe in shot glass on top of EPH. Mix thoroughly using syringe tip or plastic coffee stirrer (EPH sticks to wood) until solution is pretty clear. Pump solution into syringe.


**Consumption**. Glove both hands. Pull out a lubricated condom and rub it against the syringe's tip, that's all the lube you'll need. I find that the best position to administer the solution is lying in bed on your back and pulling your legs over your shoulders. Hold your legs in position with your left arm (if you're right-handed) and use your right hand to insert the syringe tip into the anus, push it in about 2" to 2.5" (more than that misses the bulb resulting in less efficient delivery), casually push the piston. Pull syringe out. Maintain position a few minutes (usually 2 or 3 min), until the urge to push the liquid out (a natural reflex) goes away, at which time the bulb is closed and the solution is securely trapped inside. 


Now rise and glow %)

so guys - 3F-Phenmetrazine or eph? in terms of harm redustion and euphoria and value for money? also, 3F-Phenmetrazine seems to be DA meanwhile eph is DARI? whoch one would be your drug of choise, providing one wants to be naughty from time to time? cheers.

^3F-P for me. more functional, a bit less fiendish, no where near as bad for your nose. Has a tad like "rushy" euphoria, but still feels great! But thats just my opinion, others may feel differently. EPH snorted/smoked seems to provide a bit more euphoria, but I still got a very "nice" warm feeling from 3FP, just not quite as strong. I also found 3FP to last a tad bit longer. I mean unless you are going to take EPH orally I wouldn't recommend it. 1 week of snorting EPH did the same amount of damage as 2 years of snorting mephedrone, even with the nasal spray bottle trick.

I'm not surprised, it is perhaps the most corrosive chemical I've ever willingly ingested.


I did a lil' test of just how corrosive it is - it gave me chemical burns if left on the skin, even in minute quantities. 


Its synth does leave room for impurities that could be the explanation, but I get the feeling it is simply an inherent property.


Also had to get a new debit card after using it to line up EPH - melted the plastic!

If you want a recreational stimulant Ethylphenidate shits on 3F-P. The only way i see people rating it highly is if you are new to stimulants otherwise it's barely stimulating with no euphoria. 3f-phen doesn't even supress hunger, if you are able to eat on a stimulant it can't be too intense or worthwhile in the recreational sense.

QFT, it isn't *this* drug especially, but rather it is anything that keeps you up for days..... though some DO indeed induce stimulant psychosis/paranoid delusions far quicker than others I.E. Meth, but this stuff will sure do it and for some people far quicker than others. Though FWIW I have no experience with this doing it, and never will as this stuff is indeed shit in the long and the short run and I won't ever have more experience with it. Ever.

DON'T.


The DA action will induce psychosis and manic tendencies faster than you could think.

Add in Sleep Dep. and Anorexia, along with a TERRIBLE half-life and it should ring a few alarm bells.

Plus, psyche med interactions would worry me.

That was what I first assumed, but notice it after good sleep, good food and short-term dosing.

As mentioned, a few others have noted it.

Maybe it's the mythical idiosyncratic effect that many drugs warn of and I simply fall into whatever percentile experiences it. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


I find it enjoyable at times - like 25-50ug Acid visuals but only stimulant effects.


The Stim Psychosis, if reached, is of a completely different nature, IME. More paranoid, delusional and delirious.


The pupil dilation is EXTREME though, so may explain some distortions, but not entirely.

From someone without ANY diagnosis and doubtful I would get one... those don't and should not happen when plugged man.... bad bad bad.


Now... three days up on the stuff and THAT is another story. Honestly I considered getting this shit again but quickly batted that idea right out of my mind.

I've been told MDMA doesn't mix well with bipolar /anti-psychotic meds but I didn't have any noticeable negative effects when taking ethylphenidate.

Sure wish I had trazodone / diazapines back then tho

I'm honestly surprised at the number of people who find trazadone does something significant... had some once and tossed it with a "wtf, all kinds of shitty side effects but NO actual indicated ones."

After a 3 week eph "binge" I can safely say this is one of the most useful, fun and damaging drugs I've ever used.


My usage consists of both functional and recreational use.


Functionally:

Oral - I find 25mg oral amazing to wake me up on a morning and give me that kick I need to do things. 50mg oral will speed up the process of how I do things, but I mainly took this as the 25mg wore off.

Anything above that and the functionality of it tends to drop - 50mg+ sweating becomes a problem along with changing body temperatures - cold hands and feet.

75-100mg is a dose i've used a few times for tidying - I can't say it's much use for anything else - Everything has to be rushed and done instantly or stress sets in and arguments will happen. On these doses everything has to be done my way because everything will be faster and perfect if I do it my way (or so I believe)

Even at lower doses I've noticed stress levels are increased - if something isn't on time my anger levels rise whereas generally I am a very calm (although not exactly patient) person.

I've also noticed it to be a very "subtle" drug from other peoples point of view - in a sense they won't really notice you're on something; it just seems to cause a general mood increase and heighten the levels of sociability - It's nowhere near as noticeable as amphetamines for example, you won't speed around and look cracked out at low doses.


Insufflated - I only tend to use this as a quick "boost". The onset is obviously much faster, but it is also much more euphoric and very fiendish. I'm not a huge fan of stimulants so couldn't possibly comment on how it compares to others in this sense, but being a past regular mephedrone user I find this to be almost as fiendish as that (although not half as disgusting - stinking of pissy sweat isn't the best personal image). Personally I would lay this down to the fact that I just enjoy ramming powder up my nose - I'd probably snort my prescriptions if someone told me they'd work better...

The main point I'm trying to get at here is if you want functionality, railing lines of this isn't going to cut it. I would only use it as a form of "waking myself up" when my brain is playing the old "Fuck this I've not got a clue so don't bother mate" trick.

The effects also wear off much faster and are not as subtle as when used orally.

Overall, I couldn't rate this for functional usage as I just end up distracted by the drug and popping away for another whiff.


IV/IM/Rectal: I haven't tried these ROA's as I would prefer not to destroy my body with something likening the caustic properties of sodium hydroxide. I generally prefer not to stick needles in myself or pop syringes of solution up my arse. Each to their own I suppose.


Recreationally:

To keep it short - set and setting is everything for recreational usage. I'll not delve into individual ROA's here as there's no sense in doing so.

If you're sitting alone in bed at night you're not going to have much fun. Most likely you'll end up talking bollocks to people you barely know, eagerly waiting for a reply; jittering and feeling like you live in an igloo.

Spending a day/night out with friends is a different story - It'll make you more sociable, encourage you to join in activities you'd generally have no interest in, and overall increase enjoyment.

Once again - this is dose dependant.

Small doses will give you the inner effect but not essentially show you've taken a stimulant.

Banging down a huge dose will make you look like a fet monster with widened eyes and head movements of a fucking lunatic. - 200mg oral and 4 bumps just made me wired and look like a nutter.


Side effects (Both short and medium term) - These will be different for everyone I'm sure. Everyone reacts differently and what I'm listing here is just what I've noticed from personal use.

Oral:

Sleep deprivation/insomnia - Naturally as a stimulant this happens. Although it's far easier to get to sleep on than certain other stimulants, and a little "helping hand" at sleeping will knock this on the head.

Initial jitters (This wears off quickly and after several "tests" is no longer noticeable)

Anxiety - The anxiety sensed for me is not a social/general anxiety, but more a case of "Fuck what if I come up even more and someone notices". Simple solution - Dose carefully and don't dose if you're at risk.

Pupil dilation - this is something that occurs at higher doses, I have never had pupil dilation while using what I'd refer to as a functional dose (<50mg)

"Wide eyes" - another high dose effect, looking surprised at everything or however else to explain it.

Hyperactivity - Everything must be rushed and done as fast as possible. Also acting like a child after their first red bull.

Appetite suppression - I know I'm hungry but don't feel hungry. I can eat, but decide not to. Although when I do eat it never feels forced or sickening like with other stims.

Stomach discomfort - After around a week of using, my stomach felt uneasy and sensitive. Two weeks in and I'm shitting 3+ times a day and feeling the need to "go" when I'm empty.

Diarrhoea - Relative to stomach discomfort, two weeks in and I could blast a shit out so fast it could be mistaken for a particle collider.


Insufflated

The most obvious one here would be the caustic properties of eph. Upon beginning using I could happily alternate nostrils with minimal discomfort (It still fucking hurt) and go at the shit all night like it was milk powder. Initial nose bleeds and blasting red shit out of my nose happened for the first week. After that - my nose no longer bleeds and pisses snot out like it's going out of fashion. My right nostril is unuseable as it causes further side effects which will be stated below. After heavy usage it causes soreness, irritation, and possible septum perforation. I dread to even think about what's going on up there, never mind looking. I imagine I've doled out some serious damage from the relatively short term usage of eph. I've only got myself to blame. - If you do decide to take this route I would highly recommend pre/post spraying each toot with saline solution. This will rinse the nose of any remaining substance and reduce inflammation of the membrane.

Tooth ache - I find this happens only when I use my right nostril. I'm no doctor but my best guess would be it fucks with the nerve endings or something. Every so often I will rinse my nose with the solution and some antibacterial spray, hopefully it'll prevent infection. Maybe it'll cause it to mutate into a horrible disease. Who knows.


I think I probably stated a lot of the side effects and problems complaining about my poor nostril in that first section. Either way, it's no fun walking round with "the sniffles" 24/7.


I would suggest highly against this ROA and if you must, use all the necessary precautions and safety measures possible.


TL;DR - Anything you'd consider longer than "short term usage" isn't fun. And I'm a pillock. (I'm sure nobody read this far anyway - I fucking wouldn't have).


This was intended as a method of harm reduction, hopefully for some it will help. In no way am I encouraging use of this substance, it isn't as people make it out to be.

Apologies if this offended anyone in any way.


Hope this will help in some way ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


Stay safe

I don't even know what you mean?


Why is 1g of MDMA too much? Because it is..... why is 1g of LSD WAY WAY too much? Because it is.


Start wayyyyyyyyy lower..... like with 30-40mg orally and see how you feel my friend. Don't go downing 1/5 gram of a chemical you're not familiar with.

:D 

Harm reduction in practice for sure! Good choice! Remember, you can always take more, you can NEVER "untake" something.  


And I would say that it will build as fast, and mess you up as fast as any stimulant. So yeah, there is tolerance -  but you'd have do define fast....

One last question I know I should search this thread but I'm on a mobile and it is a very large thread and time is running out till I dose. How is it for music enhancement, does it mix with alcohol and should I stay hydrated?


Thanks for the responses so far ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) I've done lots of stimulants but I'm a noob to this chemical.

Treat it like a regular stimulant, no there is not a massive jump in tolerance from ONLY one day of use (or two... ) but I bet there is cross-tolerance with other stimulants, I just don't have a clue.  Dunno about alcohol, of COURSE you should stay hydrated... that's kind of a silly question....

For me it has no discernable side-effects and is essential.for.sleep. I always slept well then randomly developed insomnia about 14 months back (no other change in meds / drugs). I can always get to sleep quick (I think Risperidone weighs me down all daY) but I'll constantly wake up all morning long. Even with the trazodone I do this a bit but at least can fall back asleep usually. 

Going thru etizolam/alcohol/cannabis w/ds when I use those substances makes it all the more essential (Melatonin helps too but wears off quick)


Back OT, the International supplier I just bought an RC benzo from jacked me and sent a random bunk benign product. They sell ethylphenidate crystals (not sure what's up with those) but looks like I can't trust them now. 


I know I bought ethylphenidate powder in the US a few years back, wish I remembered where.


What's the deal with these crystals tho? I don't like to sniff stimulants .. and certainly not IV/anal.

Don't suppose crystals are smokable?


Probably will have to wait a while anyway to cover my $300 rip-off.

Tolerance isn't hugely noticeable - It does build up but a low dose will still do the trick with a tolerance after regular usage.

Had 2 doses of 50 mg over 3 hours. It was really nice and pleasant. Didn't give a buzz as much but just put a real good mood without highlighting to everyone that I was off my face. 8/10

200mg is far too much, EPH is surprisingly potent, 200mg EPH ~ 125mg MPD.

For oral use: 30-40mg is a good start, lasting 2-4 hours.

Nasal: 20-30mg, duration of a single dose is about an hour, when binging this can drop to 20-30 minutes between doses!


Note: these durations don't include the comedown and residual effects which can last ~12h from your last dose!


Less is more is a philosophy applicable to EPH more than most drugs. I have dosed from 5-200mg (single doses) and anything over 75mg just isn't worth it - the side effects massively outweigh the positives.

I couldn't agree with this enough - higher dosage begins to bring out the side effects, and it can soon turn from fun to shit with eph.

200mg without tolerance is just fucking ruthless - that's not a good idea at all to whoever planned that one.


Careful, accurate dosage and starting low is key here ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Crystals are simply that... crystals. 

The powder is simply crushed/milled crystals - it's harder to adulterate crystalline solids than a bag of white powder so the purity is potentially higher. Not necessarily so, though.


Effects should be no different than powder.

Vaping EPH in any form is NOT something I'd advise, aside from the foul, caustic, corrosive vapours, it's also fiendish as all buggery. ![:!](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/argh.gif)

Agreed.

First time i tried it i had ~40 and it gave me instant diarrhoea and dysphoria.

For some reason immediately upped the dose to ~100mg (ie i took 60mg more) - which someone had posted somewhere on bluelight or elsewhere as the only dose bothering with - pretty goddamn counterintuitive and irresponsible -  and ended up having a great time.


Im not trying to contradict anyone or suggest excessive dosing.

Were i to try this chem for the first time again, i would probably do the same.


However i'm agreeing with erikmen's statement; we're all different.


To illustrate this point in a different way, i wouldn't take ethylphenidate again.

Caustic nasty crap IMO

This i also agree with. I never reached the fiendish stage because the caustic vapours just felt paincul and painful and wrong. Don't do it - respect your lungs and respiratory system.

They are "vaporable" off of foil, though it's fiendish as fuck and not something I'd recommend over the rectal route unless that just bothers you to such an extent.

Really counter intuitive, but glad to here it didn't turn into mega-dysphoria. My guess is you got a threshold effect and then put it into more normal territory? Would you agree? 


I can't say I was every dysphoric with the stuff but I was strung out and anxious though I don't equate that with dysphoria. I will mention again that this isn't a stimulant I would ever be buying again with other stuff out there.

It certainly is an odd one, dosage wise.

The high changes completely as you vary the dose/ROA.


Nasal and Vaped are my preferential ROA's. 

Given I'm mid-binge my doses are not advisable given the tolerance build-up.

However: 40mg snorted every 30 minutes is keeping me going, ~75mg still gets me that wide-eyed, scatty but euphoric rush I crave.


Vaping is a wholeeee 'nother beast, however.

Safe? No. Corrosive vapours + constant redosing + potentially cardiotoxic stimulant + awful duration = Far from safe.

It really epends on the ROA you use, when you plug it (u need to know how to plug "propper") ethylhen has a very clean stimulation, and at the same time it's appeasing.

high bio-availability

conveniant duration IMO


Compared to the low B-A or oral ROA

The short duration, horrrible crash/come-down, burns like fuck, nose bleeds etc. if one snorts ethylphenidate often

IV and IM, not for an RC, pharmaceutical grade would be safer but i've read a few reports stating the effects aren't that great this way, way way too short lived (can't remember if the report's said about the rush),  even more horrrrible crash than instranasal

Is there actually any quality/effects difference between rock, glass, snowball, powder? 


The last powder batch I had was really shit. Not much to write home about. Although a powder batch I had about a year ago was actually pretty good and felt a lot like coke but with massive residual stimulation and a horrible crash.

Could someone please explain why re-dosing Ethylphenidate is so horrible? I kinda need to make it 36 hours without sleep and this is the best stuff I have, other than coffee, and I have to, be alert, more than coffee can do. I have six different Benzos to cut edges but would rather not.Thanks.

Re-dosing is awful because it quickly loses the enjoyable aspects, leaving only the side effects. Yet the DA based compulsion keeps strong until it's Day 5 and the shadow people start to bore you.

Shit... I was just thinking a, small dose of 30mg and a second if the same. Well, I did that. It blew chunks. Etizolam in a huge dose got me out of it- kinda got a tolerance issue there. Then I slept 12 hours, woke up, pissed, ate something and slept another nine hours. Seems the only time I enjoy this stuff is in very low doses ( 15 - 25 mg) orally, taken in one parachute. Then there's some effects I don't like but they're mild. Weird thing is a vendor I use for Benzos derivatives sent me two grams of the stuff with my last order., "free", oldest trick in the book, but it worked. 


Not really though  b/c I  not that impressed, reminds me of ephedrine, too much unwanted physical stimulation. But it has its value, and some redeeming qualities, it's just I'd take meth over this any day. I don't do uppers anymore, but for this unexpected excursion. Think I'll ditch the rest and not look back.


What's the use of a stim you can't reup, can't slam, can't snort and is caustic as fuck?

Hey guy's, I'm moving into my new house next week and plan on trying some of this(Have no tolerance to any drugs apart from Cannabis) iv done a lot of stimulants in the past so i know what to expect, the thing is I'm planning to get some [FONT=arial, sans-serif]flubromazepam for the comedown (Done Benzo'z in the past too) as i can't get hold of any Etizolam.


Iv heard the come-up for Flub is a good few hours compared to Etizolam, so i plan on taking the Flub a few hours before i finnish my last few lines, will i be able to sleep if i roughly take 8mg of Flub(No benzo tolerance either)[/FONT]

I've recently been taking this once a fortnight. I haven't found anything that comes quite as close to methadrone than this.i normally get it under the name 'amplify' from my pipe shop but they didn't have any half grams of that and the guy said 'Ching' was the exact same I checked the empty amplified pack I had and right enough they both say ethyl 2-pherryl-2-piperddin-2-ylacetate

This is the second time I've bought the 'Ching' brand and found it to feel no where near as good. I do not believe it to be a tolerance thing as it's been a fortnight.                                       TLDR ; I'm just wondering if anyone else experienced huge differences in quality from batch to batch or brand to brand? I'm in the UK. P.s I'm injecting it. I am well aware if the risks. I've taken all possible precautions. I'm an experienced IV  heroin addict so I'm not fucking about more than usual with needles. I in no way recommend this but the rush was immense from amplify but this bloody Ching brand I don't feel any 'euphoria' just the usual upper stuff.

I haven't attempted to snort this chemical ever since my first trial run with left me with really bad drainage and stuffiness. I've been bombing a fair amount from time to time so my only concern at this point is if the caustic nature of the chemical damaging my stomach..

Well ADD/ADHD suffer's do take it daily although its methlethylphenidate but I doubt that makes a massive difference. Raw powder prob a bit harsher on the stomach but I can see it being that much off a difference.

I've never noticed any stomach issues, but I don't use eph very much. If you're worried about it, dissolve it in water.

Uhhh, what?


Ethylphenidate is the same potency than methylphenidate and more selective for dopamine transporter than NET:


[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4237660/](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4237660/)


> "EPH, or ritalinic acid ethyl ester, is the next higher ester homolog of dl-MPH, i.e., (2R:2’R,2S:2’S)-α-phenyl-2-piperidineacetatic acid ethyl ester (Fig 1). It has been chemically characterized as the racemic hydrochloride salt12,13 and as its separate enantiomers.14 As with MPH15 all reported catecholaminergic activity of racemic EPH resides in the d-2R:2’R-isomer. However, the more selective neurochemical actions of EPH14,16, and its greater resistance to metabolic hydrolysis17, distinguish EPH from MPH. These differences offer the potential for exploitation in psychotherapeutic drug discovery.

However, a much more distinct difference in potencies between MPH and EPH became apparent at the level of the NET, where the IC50 for d-MPH again exhibited high potency (39 nM), while d-EPH was 7 times less active (290 nM). In addition, the NET Ki values differed by 18-fold: 206 nM for d-MPH compared to 3,700 nM for d-EPH. These homologs were inactive at the serotonergic transporter.16

Not only does it show the same activity in rats, it has almost the exact same Ki values for dopamine transporter, and yet way way less norepinephrine transmitter potency. This is quite a good thing if you want to get high and not completely stunned by norepinephrine. 


People aren't usually abusing it for some good stimulation, they're abusing it for that dopamine rush, or they'd be abusing drugs more selective for NET.


In conclusion, it is not 50 percent the strength of methylphenidate, and if you're using it like that you're doing too much. 


Now that is, unless you're merely referring to focalin (pure d-methylphenidate) in which case yeah it probably is, but some people prefer racemic drugs to enantiomerically pure drugs. You should be more clear though as when I think of methylphenidate I think of ritalin which is racemic.

Most references to MPD on this board are assuming the dextro isomer, given pharmaceutical companies have the time/money/staff to provide enantiometrically pure products.

EPD, however, is mainly sold as the racemate, given it is a grey market product and thus; profit is king.

The expense and expertise required means most RC vendors don't even attempt isomer separation.

The data varies on the exact loss of potency caused by the methylation, but it is generally accepted to be approximately: 1mg MPD ~ 1.5-2mg EPD.


My own subjective approximation based on my personal experience is that 1mg MPD ~ 1.75-2mg EPD.


EDIT: This potency reduction as one lengthens the carbon chain holds true for the isopropyl homologue, though limited data exists, anecdotally: 1mg MPD ~ 1.75mg EPD ~ 2.5-3mg IPD.

Not referring to Focalin (D-Threo-Methylphenidate). I'm referring to standard pharmaceutical MPH preparations, which contain racemic D/L-Threo-Methylphenidate, but do not include the other optical isomers of the drug. On the other hand, I would suspect that most RC vendors will be selling a dirty mix of D/L-Threo-EPH and D/L-Erythro-EPH, unless they specifically claim otherwise.


That being said, I've had EPH marketed as the d-threo before, and while it's better than some of the other stuff I've gotten, it's still weaker than MPH. I'm going to go ahead and assume that you've never had MPH before (I'm currently prescribed Ritalin and Vyvanse, and used to be prescribed Focalin) so take my word on it. Here's a table comparing binding between the drugs:


![NvL7z.png](https://www.bluelight.org/community/proxy.php?image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2FNvL7z.png&hash=705e9a4ace56ced152f831c459ee1257)


People often make the assumption that dopamine=good and norepinephrine=bad, but that's not necessarily true. MPH obviously has a *much* higher affinity for NET, which might have something to do with it's subjectively more potent effects.

I don't assume norepinephrine is bad, but that it causes more residual stimulation than the rush generally sought after by people abusing it. Now as a functional psychostimulant, for focus or as an anorectic, I'm sure it's very much preferred. 


So the far left is racemic D/L-Threo-Methylphenidate?


And as for methylphenidate, I've had it, but never in a quantity to have any idea from a subjective perspective as to it's strength. And even if I did I would then have no assurance that the ethylphenidate I had was pure enough to even compare the two.

I was under the impression that the "rush" was a combination of a few factors: one being the mix of affinity to DA/NET (5HT playing a minor role). Without any NET in there there will be no "tweaky" rush. But please correct me if I'm wrong I don't wanna spread misinformation. The second being how fast/easily it crosses the BBB and acts in the brain.


If you've ever smoked tobacco out of a bong, with ZERO nicotine/tobacco tolerance it's basically a bellringer, which is a trip.

I ordered it, but got scammed. Don't get this if you live in the states. I might get oxolinic acid. I need a DRI to stack with the NDRI prolintane (which releases more norepinephrine than dopamine).

Not exactly sure what you are asking because of the choice of words at the end, however if you have an ADHD diagnosis coming, I would recommend using the meds they give you, and discontinuing the EPH use.

I thought EPH was an uptake inhinitor, but a releasing agent. Either way, sounds like you don't have the best internet browsing practices or discretion. And while I pray it never comes to this (so far so decent) buying RCs isnt like going to Macy's. And sometimes you get scammed, that's life it happens. Just don't use that source again. 


There's a mod on another sub-form who would know all about that.

EPD has a wicked DRC, 5mg can be the difference between euphoria  and psychotic paranoia.

4-MMC, even pure, has a much higher dosage to start with. 'Street' 'Drone more so. Same with your Lido... sorry, Co*caine.


At ~30mg a dose, every 2 hours, that's 60 hours of binging.

Obviously, tolerance and exceptional redose compulsion reduce that figure.


For reference; 1,000mg will last 2/3 days at binge-levels, even though I'm a dedicated tweaker.

Just saying this to make sure you've heard it, MGLA, although I'm sure you've heard it before: EPH is a miserable drug to binge on. Past the first couple doses it's all anxiety and no fun. Personally I find that all reuptake inhibitors have this characteristic. If you're actually planning on staying stimmed up for longer than a night out, I think it's in your better interest to find a longer-acting compound.

After a few days of trial and error, I find that eating 20mg every 3 hours with some food is somewhat enjoyable. I'm getting that emotional flatline though. It's cool for me, but being maximum stoic is a lonely existence. Nobody really likes a robot as a friend or husband. I feel like my brain needed a few days to learn ethylphenidate. I almost wrote it off as a total loss, but abandoning the nasal route altogether has been a moderate success. I was never looking for a rush, just some way to spend the whole day above baseline. She doesn't like to be rushed, and will punish those that chase that silly dream. I believe the ideal use for this is still elusive to me, but I'm learning. I'm going to figure out a completely crashless dosing schedule. I never use benzos or any sleep aid. I learned to function on meth with a healthy eat/sleep cycle, but that bitch changed me so I quit. More later

Spent a few days cocktailing EPD, various BZD's and Fentanyl Citrate.

Eph HCl yields corrosive, acrid fumes when heated for inhalation, almost instant pyrolysis. Converting the salt to the 'freebase' is easy enough though, much more forgiving in comparison.

*H.R.*

The vapours are still harsh, undoubtedly corrosive and the damage from inhaling them is not worth the sketchy, cracked-out high that results.

Also, I have mentioned this before, and it does bear repeating - vaped EPD is nothing like snorted or oral. It's a totally different animal. The re-dose compulsion is extreme, but yields little positive effects after the fourth dose or so, then it just becomes a binge to delay the comedown. 

Snorted and FB'd are so different that a Coke/Crack comparison is not an exaggeration. Except the latter at least gives euphoria...


This stuff is insidiously addictive.

^I found insufflated EPH to be mediocre. It did have a minor, short rush which is more than I can say for most stims. But still it was compulsive, and hardly enjoyable after the first few times getting high off of it. 


Never vaped it, and don't plan on it from what I have read.

MGLA, there is a treasure trove of information on this particular substance, and as someone who had used it for months, I concur with the most obvious theme on the substance, which points it out as an equally dysphoric stimulant as often as it is euphoric, which is a terrible ratio. Plus, it's awfully habit-forming for such a negative-effect ridden RC.

Took 500mg of this in one dose orally. 


The aftermath was for me, tingling sensation in arms and legs, inability to get an erection. Pain in chest, elevated heart beat and blood pressure. Cold extremities. It honestly felt like I was putting my cardiovascular to its limits, this lasted for 2 days. I also had blood in my stool.


I experienced paranoid delusions, (thinking everyone was looking at me/talking about me). Voices and noises that were probably not real. 


The paranoia lasted for a day, followed by anxiety (thinking I was going to die).


Overall a stupid dose by me.

It's much stronger than the purest coke, more paranoid & dysphoric too. It's not a drug to really binge on like that. A gram lasted me about 3 months. If you can have a good time on a gram of coke over 6-8 hours then you probably won't want over 250mg eph in that time & you'll likely regret doing that much. It's maybe 3-5x more potent than good cocaine, but not as fun.


It'll rot your nose much faster too if you decide to snort it & there's no rush, no real benefit over oral at all. I can still feel nose damage after snorting 30mg about 4 weeks ago, still had blood in my nose until a few days ago, I'm never snorting eph again.


It's best in small doses, under 30mg, oral. You'll probably want some benzos on hand if you take it any further than a single 30mg oral dose.


It's definitely no coke or mephedrone, it seems to be a selective dopamine reuptake inhibitor, so there's no real rush, little euphoria, just paranoia & compulsion to redose if you go too far. It's like just the negative effects from cocaine abuse without any fun. There's no warm happy serotonin feeling. No adrenalin rush & energy. It provides a nice pleasant mental focus for a few hours with a low oral dose, but any higher doses lose that effect & will just send you mad.

I can either get, Powder or Crystaline Poweder or Crystal, whats the difference between powder and crystaline powder? Is it just smaller shards? I want to go for the straight powder but i have a feeling it wont be as good and have no idea why, i think it's because i read in this thread that it's just the leftovers or something?

Whether it's powder or crystal has no bearing on the quality of it.


The more finely powdered it is the quicker it will dissolve, making powder better for e.g. nasal administration, but other than that all the forms are equivalent.

I overdosed on EP at 0.5 grams (just got a new scale from China and I thought that it's precision was 0.01 and not 0.1) which turned out to be false because half my baggie (which contained 1gr) was gone. I also had a horrible bloody nose, excessive heart rate and during the downdown Horrible physical cramps (especially my legs) the next day. I could barely/move and eat but the second day (couldn't sleep that night) I got Naproxen and that helped a lot and a few days I was completeley fine (except for the fact that I kelt sweating the chemical out). 


I Definetely DO NOT reccomend this, the negative effects far outweigh the positive *And I've learned it the hard way* Also, I should learn to be a lot less careless 8(


I'm also gonna add that this I consomed this in about 3 hours and that I only weight around 95 pounds.

Sounds like you had a rougher time than me. I'm 200lbs and didn't insufflate just took it orally. It's now day 5 and I finally feel human again. I think my renal system is healing. This was not worth the short high I will never be using eph again.

This shit is garbage. I tried a couple grams. The jitters to stimulation ratio was not good. I'd rather fuck with benzedrex, hell any (recreational) stimulant really. Methylphenidate is much better IMO.

It seems like most people dislike this chem, but everyone also uses it in much higher doses than I do. I don't enjoy stims much at all but did enjoy methylphenidate, so decided to try this stuff out. It's enjoyable for me but I insufflate in the range of about 5-10(max)mg at a time every hour or so, and only maybe 3 doses through a nights experience. I get a pleasant euphoria that I don't get w other stims. Amphetamine does absolutely nothing for me, coke is okay. This gives me about the same amount of pleasure as coke w less compulsion, though methyl for me feels the best of all three. Granted I'm sure I've never had the greatest quality coke. Anyone else use doses as light as I do? Also with beers it is very nice as I know has been well documented.

This advice applies to you man. You're eyeballing a super high dosages and then slamming it. You're going to have a heart attack or stroke or something. That shit is crazzzyyyyy. 1 gram when I did this shit lasted me more than 7 days.

Overdoing it and IVing it. I bought some for a friend, and took like 60mg out of it.


I was doing 4-6mg doses at a time vaped. Eyeballing 100-150mg *and then* shooting it is just kinda outrageous. You shouldn't be IVing RCs (or really anything but pharmecutical vials meant for IV/IM use), and then if you ignore that you should at the very least be using 1 micron wheel filters which I bet you guys are skipping. There are NO reason to skip that step. You're already doing something dangerous, minimize it by buying syringe/wheel filters. One more time, there is **NO** reason to skip this step. If you can buy your RCs online, you can easily head over to amazon or ebay and pick up a 5 pack of .2um filters for 10 bucks or cheaper (I don't think this counts as sourcing since it is pure harm reduction, sorry if I'm wrong). 


If you don't want to filter every time you can buy sterile syringes with huge (non IV use) needles and sterile vials + bacteriostatic water and make up high concentration sterile solutions by dissolving a bunch in a set amount of water and filtering it with the wheel filters all at once (using sterile syringes/filters/vials and bacteriostatic water) and then suck it up and dilute it with more bacteriostatic water before injection.


Honestly, I reccommend you not do it at all, but if you're going to be shooting the stuff, this is the way it MUST be done. You're likely to fuck your veins up anyway because it's so caustic, but this way you'll be as safe as you can get while shooting caustic chemicals. You should really be shooting this stuff into your rectum with an oral syringe. You still get the rush and you're not injecting this shit into your vein or fucking your nasal membrane up.

Yeah G, apart from dosage, everything was done safely, filtered and brand new fixed needle used. 


I used my biggest vein and it left me with a pain for a few days there, but I think its all good now, im gonna stick to good ones like coke and speed. 


They don't ruin your veins after a few doses but man  shits expensive hahaha

little bumps go along way, you cant chase the rush with this, eventually it fucks off leaving you feeling shitty, benzos help the shittyness but your gonna be awake for a while.


small bumps every few hours and its all good, as good as that first fat line is, you will never get back to that or even worth the pain getting there.


ive been a long time user, used to binge for days on this every weekend chasing the high, but it took me a while but i understand this drug now, just take it easy and make sure your gonna be kept busy doing something you like, otherwise the dysphoria sets in

Anyone else notice theirs change color? I got some for a friend and when he showed me it a week later instead of semi-clear crystals it was more opaque. Tastes a little different too:

Can't believe this is finally being banned. Tbh it's been a long time in the making. Also as if methylnaphthidate is being banned without being widely released.

Looks like the vendors played this one smart and held off the release of Methylmethylphenidate (4-Me-TMP) until the control order was ratified last Friday.


It's already available from select UK vendors and I'm sure it'll be rolled out to a wider distribution network in due course.

I've been taking this for the last few months. Really small amounts, a few crystals before I go to the gym to give me a 'boost'. My problem is I have a hair strand test coming up in the next few weeks. Does anyone know what it will it show up as. I've been going around in circles with advice and can't get a straight yes or no as to whether it shows as amphetamine or not! I'll be tested for 6 months history. Any REAL advice would be greatly appreciated ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

With a urine test, regular amphetamine should be gone within a week, I am unsure about Ethylphenidate, but I imagine its not much different.


Just calm it down a bit and maybe stop completely about 10 days before the test.


But I am no expert, thats the best I can give bro, sorry hahah

I received some eph in the mail today and was surprised it was crystals since it was the cheapest available to me.The last time I had it was in powder form and seemed to burn 10x as much as this stuff!


Something else I also noticed was last time I was taking SNRI medication (Effexor) and now I'm after switching to an SSRI (Zoloft) and the vasoconstriction is pretty much non existant compared to being on Effexor (too much NE inhibition).It was so bad my nostrils would swell shut and my head felt like it was going to explode! So to anyone on a medication that inhibits Nor-epinephrine STOP at the first signs of your nostrils closing or head pressure.I stupidly switched nostrils and it was NOT worth it.


With that being said get EPH'd! Go EPH yourself! EPH you! ![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif)

Hair strad Is hair strand. If there are detectable metabolites they will be detected. That being said, I'm doubtful that a -phenidate would test positive for amphetamine. Your best bet would be to go look for information mph, because EPH will likely look the same.

It's definitely a useless study aid imo.I'm glad the gram I bought is gone and won't be getting any more stimulants since I don't like being all tweaky,oily/sweaty,and smelling like fucking chemicals.Also that 'washed out' feeling the next day is just horrible.

I regret ever doing ethylphenidate.  It's been months since I last used it, but I can still only recall short euphoria followed by the most anxious and shitty feeling dysphoric high imaginable.  I never could control myself from compulsively redosing though, which I know caused a majority of the negative effects, but overall, ethylphenidate is just shit and I'm so glad it's banned.

I have been reading many posts on ethylphenidate starting with v1 of the thread (I've been up on adderall and couldn't stop reading being that I was expecting some to arrive in a few hours). I find it strange how in the beginning posts in like 2012 or so, everyone seemed to love it and be a buzz about how great the euphoria was. now as I read closer to present day more people are leaving completely different reports, more to the negative side. it makes me wonder if either people who have a monetary investment in EPD were making some of the initial reports or possibly the chemical has decreased in purity/potency. 

anyways, I just received what is supposed to be a gram of ethylphenidate in the mail. the baggy was unmarked leaving me without a definitive chemical name of what I received or a weight. 

can someone please show a picture of a 50mg line next to a penny? it would greatly be appreciated. I don't have access to a scale and my addictive nature will almost guarantee that I won't be able to wait to get one. I know that logically everyone will tell me to wait until I get a scale but in the interest of HR will you guys please help me out?

man I made the mistake of doing this garbage after being up on adderall for three days. I was crashing all night then redosed a tiny piece of adderall to take the edge off and of course while I'm starting to feel better the ethylphenidate arrives at my door. I was feeling brave because the adderall temporarily took the crash away so I eyeballed a line which might have been fifty mgs of ethylphenidate and snorted it. it was extremely painful. the feelings mixed in with the adderall so I really couldn't distinguish it. but an hour later and oh boy. if you think an adderall comedown is bad.... take some ethylphenidate with it and you will experience the worst possible dysphoria and physical discomfort that I think is humanly possible. I so regret getting this stuff . 

that aside.. I am prescribed lyrica and Neurontin.. do you guys think either of those two drugs could be beneficial or will they clash neuropharmacologically with the ethylphenidate ?

...

ok some time later

...

I had to get a back of dope (which I didn't want to do) to get me back to normal. that was the worst trainwreck of drug use I've ever had.. and I have had many catastrophes including several bromodragonFLY disasters, countless comedowns from amphetamine and mdma, and recently ran out of Klonopin before my refill date and went through bz withdrawal four days... I would rate this as the most painful to deal with next to the Klonopin withdrawal.

I was crashing all night then redosed a tiny piece of adderall to take the edge off and of course while I'm starting to feel better the ethylphenidate arrives at my door. I was feeling brave because the adderall temporarily took the crash away so I eyeballed a line which might have been fifty mgs of ethylphenidate and snorted it. it was extremely painful. the feelings mixed in with the adderall so I really couldn't distinguish it. but an hour later and oh boy. if you think an adderall comedown is bad.... take some ethylphenidate with it and you will experience the worst possible dysphoria and physical discomfort that I think is humanly possible. I so regret getting this stuff .

With .8 remaining that means you consumed 200mg between the two of you... Assuming you didn't get extra which is entirely possible. 


That's quite a bit, friend. Adderal comedowns have nothing on the -phenidates, you probably should start much much slower in the future.


In the meantime, if you're still running on multiple nights of no sleep, I think it's time you got some rest.

Maybe the people who tried it first possessed scales & used them? Small amounts don't seem so bad, it's brutal with higher or unmeasured doses, such a bad idea to rack up unmeasured lines & mix it with other stims. You'd think if you could read all those reports you wouldn't make the same mistakes as everyone else that has a bad time on eph.

so is it just coincidence that the majority of posts from the first megathread were comparing it to mdma, one of the most euphoric stims they have done with virtually no comedown TO the more up to date threads having a majority of this stuff sucks type reports that most closely match the description I've encountered? take that and match it with a few reddit threads I just read that had rc vendors offering free samples to people willing to write great experience reports on drugs like this as compensation? even methylphenidate is not that great. 

I have some to my friend because I don't have a need for it, he weighed out forty mgs, and snorted it. I texted him a half hour ago and asked if he wanted anymore for some pot. he said "hell no I still have the rest. you can have it back. "

not to mention I've been blowing blood out of my nose all day after only doing two bumps yesterday. not red blood, purplish clotted looking hardened blood. There is many better drugs than this. it is dangerous and misrepresented in these threads

yo are completely correct.. this is why adderall is an extremely popular pharmaceutical, and ethylphenidate has to be sold on black market. do you think if it had anything popular to offer that the pharmaceutical industry wouldn't have picked it up? people are under the impression that drugs like these are being created on the sly so that you could avoid prosecution and obtain a legal high. no, it's quite simple.. both sides are being sold by the same people. worthwhile chems will be branded and commercialized. the run off garbage won't be thrown away but sold to naiive people in a grey area where lawsuits can't be filed because they are labeled "for research only". either way the money is being collected by the same people.

For what it's worth: I've been experimenting with EPH for functional purposes. I insufflate, with doses no higher than 10mg, and no more than a single redose.


This past weekend, I was severely sleep-deprived and physically exhausted, but needed to perform (physically, mentally, emotionally) so I did this three days in a row. At these very modest doses (a total of 10mg each of the fist two days and 15mg on the final one) I would say that I was pretty impressed with the functional properties of EPH. Instead of feeling like a zombie, I was actually in good form both physically and mentally. Aside from my responsibilities, I also managed to cram in some personal reading and writing. My last dose of the day was at ~4PM but I still needed some alcohol to fall asleep at 11.


The day after, I feel tired, but as I say I'm severely sleep deprived (for other reasons), so that's to be expected. At moderate doses the crash seems reasonable...


Just throwing this out there. It might indeed be totally inferior to amphetamine (I have no experience) but I'm pretty impressed with the help it provided.

There are always a lot of shill posts when there's a new chemical around saying how amazing it is, vendors want to sell stuff. Vendors often send free samples to people willing to write glowing reviews on forums. Every new stimulant is going to be called the next mdma, or the new cocaine, or whatever.


It's far from the next MDMA, it's a bit shit really, but with the right dose it's not too terrible for a basic stim, as long as you plug it dissolved in water... or swallow it dissolved in a drink. It'll tear your nose apart if you snort it. I wouldn't want to IV it either & if I did I'd do a very small amount very diluted. It's strong & caustic stuff, dissolving it in some liquid helps a lot. I got a load cheap when it was temporary banned in the UK, so I've been plugging 25-35mg doses dissolved in 2ml, but that's only after I've built some tolerance, I used to just have 20mg dissolved in a drink. Higher doses are more dysphoric, more anxious.


Anything over 15mg/ml burns slightly when plugging, I wouldn't want to go over 20mg/ml. Be especially careful if you're IVing it, IV users messing their veins up was the reason given by our government for the UK ban. I'm not sure there's much reason to IV it either. Plugging seems the best place for a shit drug like this. Oral dissolved in a drink isn't terrible either, slightly weaker, takes 10-20mins to work, smoother onset, lasts longer & there's less crash, more likely to upset my stomach & make me shit though.


Measured low oral doses can be quite nice & functional, still feel awake, alert & focussed but with less bad side effects.


You really need some milligram scales, even cheap ones. It's impossible to eyeball weights, especially if you have crystal, 20 or 25mg is a full active dose orally, 10mg is a threshold dose, it seems as strong as methylphenidate. Of course there are many better drugs, but low doses aren't as terrible as high doses, it was cheap enough in the pre-ban sale & it has earned a place in my stash. Just be careful with how you take it & how much you take.


I was having little nose bleeds & pain for about 3 weeks after snorting a couple of tiny ~20mg lines, it's really not worth snorting lines of it. Get a saline nasal spray or find some other way to wash your nose out with saline or water, keep it moisturised until it heals & don't snort this shit again.

completely fair and I agree. I am low on adderall so I gave this another try but only a very small bump maybe ten mgs and you are right it's not bad at all. not great but I did mix it with a decent amount of lyrica and Klonopin. a nice mixture. how much did you put in how big of a drink? doesn't plugging erode your anus?

No experience here, but of course you should be aware that all the usual rules apply: EPH is a short lasting compound--if you push dosages too high you could find yourself in trouble after it starts to fade away.

to follow up I ended up splitting four bags (stamps) iv with my girlfriend, which usually is nothing for my tolerance and ended up having an unusually euphoric high.

don't know if it was because of the ethylphenidate or not

Compared to heroine. 


It's dangerous to combine short-lasting uppers with long-lasting downers in high dosages. This is because after the upper faded away, if you dosed too high you can find yourself in respiratory distress.

thank you for the information. I'll definitely keep that in mind and warn other members if I have to.

next question,

what is the final verdict on the ethyl being injected iv? will it eat the veins away and kill me or will the blood dilute it's caustic nature? I've seen speculation but no definitive answers

mygreenbic... what're you doing? You're talking about how awful it is, then shooting it up... It's gotta have some good aspects or you need to get some help, seriously.


I personally like using it to get me un-drunk if I've had too much to drink, cause I really don't like alcohol to begin with, just get peer pressured once in a while by shitty coworkers. Or with MXE, it's a really cool feel to be on the verge of holing and then ripping a fat line, like being shot out of a cannon.


The second line is always the best, and anymore than that is an exercise in futility. And the more you use it, the more the side effects,  less the positives, more so than other stimulants. Once every month or two and you'll have some fun with it, more than that, get something else if you want a stim.

funny you should say that because I was just going to write about this issue. this might be one of the most extremely addictive drugs as in the redosing sense. like the above quoted said, I don't even like it and now I'm shooting it up!

to me it's a drug that you take and forget that your even on it. you don't even really realize the drug until you stay coming down and feeling crappy and need to redose. 

I probably wouldn't have done this drug a second time if it weren't for the fact that I have like three of my adderall left for the month so waking up craving a boost I've been taking small bumps of ethyl. this automatically leads me to compulsive redosing throughout the day. I have to admit though, the last time I iv d it, it felt really good. it took a few minutes though. 

one more point. shouldn't there be a warning at the beginning of this thread that if snorted you have a good chance of causing permanent physical damage? I took a few bumps and I already have damage and scaring in my nose.

Whilst it was far from the only caustic psychotropic bombarding my nasal cavity at the time, EPD caused more damage than anything else - after an extended binge, a partition of the structural cartilage literally fell out of my bloody nostril. I can no longer snort... anything, I can barely breathe through it.


Anyone who insists on I.N. admin. please take the time to create a bacteriostatic, volumetric solution for their EPD.

I've only ever snorted this, had a binge here and there, but haven't done any it in months. Nose is fine. But the binges have been long enough to cause huge scabs and shit, but my nose has always healed fine(as far as I can tell)

does anyone know if I could take my tramadol while on ethylphenidaye? 

I have clonazepam so I'm not concerned with seizures, just with serotonin syndrome. I know ethylphenidaye works mainly on dopamine and norepinephrine, but the fact that it is so vasoconstrictive concerns me that it might have activity on serotonin. after all serotonin function is to open and close blood vessels (that's how it was named and yes of course I'm aware it has many other functions). 

Someone that knows the neuropharmocology of both please jump in. I'd like to take it for Few reasons.

1) it's an nmda antagonist which can help prevent any of the damage caused to my neurons because of my ethylphenidate and amphetamine usage

2) while it may be weak at the mu site it still seems to give me a nice opiated feeling while mixed with my suboxone

3) I have an eroded disc in the cervical spine region which is extremely painful. when I take a lot of stims the pain seems to increase. something happens to the tissue on the side of my neck that feels almost like shingles or something under the skin. I say that because it flares up and seems to follow the major nerves in my neck. Amphetamine always makes it do this but with this ethyl it seems worse. I dunno maybe it's fibromyalgia. surprisingly tramadol helps more than Vicodin or Percocet with all of the neck pain (along with 600mg lyrica a day and 1.8 grams gabapentin.

So yea I really want to take my tramadol so someone please chime in asap.


on a side note... I'm down to 2mg suboxone strips a day. I never feel them but after being on ethyl all day I just took my sub and I feel extremely high. it's a rushing amazing opiate feeling. do you think it's because they are both releasing dopamine and possibly having a synergy? I can't believe how euphoric I feel off two mg suboxone and I've been on it since 2004 (it's currently 2015 making it about 11 years.) I can't even imagine the withdrawal I am going to go through. I might get on a methadone clinic and stay on a low dose to deal with it.

one more question... I'm out of my adderall for the month because of reasons I won't get in to... also almost out of ethyl which I've been using as a substitute because I usually have a withdrawal that isn't pleasant when I run out of amphetamine early.. question is if I were to pick between 2fa or ethylphenidate (never tried 2fa) which do you think would be better suited as a substitute until I get a refill. those are the only two choices I have at the moment because I need it to cone quickly from in the US and I don't know how to use bitcoin.. the only place I can get it from currently only stocks those two items. I hate the compulsion to redose on ethyl so often so if 2fa is like they I'm not sure I'd try it.

sorry for the long post and thank you in advance


edit: I'm now suddenly so high from the suboxone I took after shooting the ethylphenidate that I feel like I'm rolling. I can't hardly see my phone screen because my eyes are fluttering in a hard core state of euphoria. wow this is amazing

well I'm sitting here waiting to see if anyone knows about the pharmacology of both ethylphenidate and tramadol in the brain because I want to take some and stop redosing the ethyl. it sounds a lot easier than it is. luckily I ran into more xanax and some 2mg clonazepam so I don't have to dip into my scripted .5 klons to come down with. I also scored a gram of white widow , so I think I should have enough to get myself away from the ethyl. I had a gram a couple days ago and I have maybe five small bumps left. my nose is full of scabs and my injection site is starting to look like an infection site. that just speaks to the addictive nature of ethylphenidate. I don't even particularly like it and I ran through a whole FREAKING gram. I had one glowing experience and that was when the suboxone kicked in after a pretty large sized shot of ethyl along with some snorted lyrica. that was euphoria central. it's time for downers and alcohol.

I hope my long winded experiences help some people to make the proper decisions when deciding whether or not to order this material. I've been through almost everything with it. 

and thanks for wishing me well, Just A Guy.. I think I'll be fine, I just wish someone could tell me whether or not ethyl has any serotonergic activity so I could go ahead and take my tramadol with level head in tact

Tramadol, or some metabolite of it has some effects on serotonin & nor-epinephrine. Tramadol is a messy drug that can be very dangerous in combinations.


Benzos & benzo withdrawal are messy too.


Ethylphenidate seems like the least of your worries, but I can understand the love/hate relationship with it.


With all these drugs you need to make sure you're controlling your use & not taking too many risks.


Maybe try giving the chemicals a rest for a while & sticking to the white widow.


Is there really any reason to risk your veins, risk infections & other stuff for IV ethylphenidate? It works fine plugged, or even oral, there's no rush from it, it's dirt cheap & potent so no need to worry about wasting it. Get some miligram scales, weigh your doses & plug it or stick it in a drink if you want to do ethylphenidate. It's too caustic to mess around with undiluted, too potent to not weigh your doses & IV seems really unnecessary.


My tools for beating a stim comedown are fruit juice, some protein rich food, multivitamin, weed & sleep. Then maybe some tea, or more stims. Works every time. Leave the benzos for emergencies, they're a useful tool if used very sparingly.

I disagree with the above post that Ethylphenidate has no rush. You are certainly mistaken. I can see the potential through insufflation, IV would be akin to cocaine but apparently less intense and more drawn out which sounds great. People aren't destroying their veins for no reason this stuff is addictive and very compulsive when redosing.


Still i highly suggest not Iving Ethylphenidate as i think the risk of infection to be greater due to it's caustic nature and especially if you lack experience with intravenous administration. Rectal(in moderation) and oral seem to be the way to go. Or possible a spray for insufflation which another poster suggested.


Just got half a gram myself although i'm a bit afraid to use it rectally but i definitely don't want to further damage my nose which my very limited experience with it has already caused. I thinking a diluted dose of say.. 30mg to start dissolved in 3ml of water.

Ethylphenidate as a study aid?


The only way to be used as a functional stimulant:


- 10 mg oral (+ 100mg caffeine)  x 2-4 /day


- 5 mg insufl. x 4-6 times / day


Going for bigger doses and the stimulant goes on the "dark" side. The bonus energy cannot be tamed easily. 

The comedown is bigger and the need to redose is more forceful.

Ethylphenidate ended up causing emptiness for me and temporary depression. It was also weak for me and had a much stronger crash. Oral and insufflated ethylphenidate were both crap. I personally hate ethylphenidate! I didn't find it worthwhile, so I got rid of it. Oral doses of a-PVP or MPA are better study aids. Though phenylpiracetam and sunifiram also helps.

As much as I miss being such a high flyer in terms of amazing grades and constant energy, Ethyl literally ended up being a daily routine of about 40mg for 6 months, which ended up in going cold turkey after so much anxiety and panic attacks and heart problems it had made occur!

3f-phenmetrazine is actually quite similar, without all of the jitters, anxiety and your heart beat stays a lot slower on it. it's a bit pricey as it's fairly new but that's the closest i could think of, unless it was genuine adderall or Ritalin you could find.

but honestly i was in your boat, had no idea how i would get anything done without it, then when the ban hit, i was actually fine after a few days of freaking out... now i feel completely normal again

Hi Again,

Thanks for those answers,3f-phenemtrazine is on the shortlist,as are mephtetamine (it's cheap) synthacaine and nitracaine(both I have had and where ok ish) apart from that my head is spinning![:?](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/confused.gif).I am currently taking about one gram throughout the whole time I am awake,about 18-20 hours a 'day' orally.My nose will not let me use that way,and sub lingual now and again.I think,compared to this time last year I have a eph proof mouth,no more ulcers or anything,last year was most unpleasant at  one point where strips of skin where coming  off the insides of my mouth.Either I am very tolerant or have been buying the worst,but cheap,eph in the UK.Maybe a bit of both.

Every time I get another gram from my supply my tummy does the 'oh shit' sumersaults cos I know there is no way I can function without something to boost me.I know exactly when I need to redose and how big a bomb to do,I have been trying to make them smaller.I found some caplets I made up last year and each is 300mg so i.m trying to shrink that down.I love the way eph is not (for me now anyway) a big instant hit then nothing,I get a slow build up to just buzzing which can last for hours while I get stuff done.I generally have my last dose at about 2AM at the latest,then crash out from about 7 AM to anything from 8.30 to 3.30pm.I have even taken a dose and fell asleep,now that annoyed me when I woke up!

It's the first thing in my head now when I wake up.I know I have to get something this week,I have about 8g left (there goes my tummy again)and I am bricking it.Everything I enjoyed is slowly getting taken from me,now eph is going when I have two very nasty,painful,life altering things to get through,one my ankle getting operated on again (I am the owner of,among other physical disabilities a dislocated and fractured ankle that is collapsing after having an external fixator the year before last (It was half expected says my consultant)and my beloved ,funny,one in a billion,son is off to University,over 100 miles from home![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)(I know he wants to get away from here and live the uni life and I understand and support him 1000%)He is not your average 18 year old,how many would take their mum out,in a wheelchair and go round all the shops,with a never ending conversation between us.We get on brilliantly![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) and I dont want to lose him forever)Other things have changed,more are changing because of things that are connected (like when son goes,bedroom tax imposed,have to fight that)and I really dont think I am at a place I can do without my helper-eph-so I need to order something fast!

Your son sounds like a great guy! Hey, you know that you probably won't ever feel like you're "at a place you can do without your helper 'eph'" -- It *might *be a good time to consider teaching yourself how to function without the stims again before it becomes a really bad problem. And if it's already a bad problem, you'll find a lot of support and information over in the Bluelight Recovery Forums. 1g of ethylphenidate is never a good thing to have around, much less 8!

Avalynne, I agree with JAG: Now that availability is cut off, it's the perfect time to try to cut out the dependence. I'm thinking mostly of the toll that taking high daily doses of this stuff (or any stimulant really) must be having on your heart, mind and body.


As I've mentioned, I'm just starting to take (relatively small) weekend doses of this stuff for functional purposes (just trying to be a good parent!) and I'm already realizing that before I know it I could be in trouble. I don't want to let myself get to that point, and you deserve to be released. Of course I don't know your reality, but please consider.


Regardless, good luck to you!

I wish I was strong enough to do without.I sort of wish I had never had the idea of trying RC's,but the other part of me says I have had the best year in a long time.I wish I could be content with 'nothing' but when I look back and read my diary I'm like 'God it is so much easier to get up and cook a meal/clean up etc now' and believe me it is.I actually do think it has made me a better person in the last year,I cook more,I clean more,I moan about it less,I am happier just doing my own thing,in my room,I don't feel I'm missing out on stuff the way I did (I was convinced I was missing out on life,because me and Hubby never went out drinking with friends,we have none and we don't drink,I had problems with alcohol surprise surprise but have not drank for nearly 5 years)Hubby has his game addiction,I have eph.Or did...


So where do I go from here?Yep,those of you who say this is a good time to stop are right,but I'm scared to.![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)I like life better with a bit of energy in it instead of struggle.Oh bugger.Why did I ever start this,you stupid girl.But thank you for your very kind help and words,yeah,my son is a great guy,one in a billion million!!(And  yes I know he would not be happy if he ever found out,he thinks its week and foolish people who end up addicts to whatever,and he is right!)I'm just researching my shortlist,and have found somewhere that does you 3 different things for a very reasonable price so I'm thinking of trying 3FPM,MPA and MXP but I recon I'm just opening another can of worms.I dunno what to do![:!](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/argh.gif)eek!

there is a supposed new type of eph  out but i won't recommend it to you as i found it little too strong and not enough is known about it yet and yes i think you should cut down a little as well.

I became dependent on it but I cannot say it ruined my life. There is something benign with eph because at least in my case it did not really burn me out physically only mentally. It seems less driving less jittery than other stimulants. And I always got the bill instantly : I usually felt worse than before when it wore off, so it was not deceiving for me.

I hear and believe you and don't think you're wrong. If you think it made you a better person then you may be right. Nevertheless, consider this possibility: You tried this stuff because you were looking to fill a void and it succeeded. Don't beat yourself up for that. In some sense, even the most hard-core addict has a real unsatisfied need at the core of their use. The problem is only if the habit is unsustainable (financially, emotionally, physically, etc) and will finally cause more harm than good. I think with the regular high dosages that you are taking, this could be inevitable, but that's just my hunch. Only you can take an honest look at yourself and decide whether it is still going in a good direction or not.


I would just echo others and say that you should stay away from other RC stimulants. Who knows, they may grab an even bigger hold of you that you regret even more so. (And for sure stay away from MXP - you mentioned it for some reason - which is a dissociative.)


Here's a tough thought that I grapple with myself: Maybe the drugs you have taken have brought out a side of you that has a hard time coming out without them. However, now that you recognize this part of yourself, maybe you can bring it with you into your sober living as well. Easier said than done of course, but something to think about.

i was very dependant on eph and then benzo to sleep, but honestly it's really quite easy to give it up.. because the positive side effects of getting off it after a week are wonderful, your heart/chest/body feels so much healthier...

I have only ever experienced ethylphenidate via the consumption of Ritalin and alcohol, and therefore was already experiencing considerable loss of motor-skill and reduced social inhibition on account of the booze *prior* to the ingestion of methylphenidate. I used the Ritalin to pep me up and/or shag all night/ and or be the last man standing/ and or drive home "safely" after a big night out.


So I never consumed specific amounts of ethylphenidate. Although I consumed specific amounts of methylphenidate (usually between 40mg and 80mg, snorted), the amount of ethanol in my bloodstream would have always been slightly different when I took the Ritalin. 


My question is this: when the compound ethylphenidate is taken on its own, IE it *hasn't *been "created" by consuming booze then Ritalin, is the feeling different on account of the absence of the soporific effects of alcohol? 


Or is ethylphenidate, taken by itself, soporific in nature too?


More specifically, which is better? Consuming alcohol and then Ritalin to create ethylphenidate in the bloodstream, or taking ethylphenidate on its own, leaving alcohol completely out of the equation? I know this is a subjective question, but I am curious to hear what people think...thanks ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

To me,ethylphenidate`s effects feel different compared methlyphenidate(Ritalin)+booze.  Like Ritalin,ethylphenidate is a stimulant so you won`t be getting sleepy on it. I`m not 100% sure but I think ethylphenidate is 1/3 less potent compared to Ritalin. I don`t feel as motivated when I take ethylphenidate or as stimulated as when I take Ritalin. Ethylphenidate alone does not cause problems with motor skills. Booze taken with Ritalin will cause loss of fine motor skill but that`s from the alcohol.

Unfortunately yes (it is really dangerous, because after the exp. you will feel double the amount of pain). Every stimulant is (for me).

For the longest time I would have said in no way does it dull pain. 

That was until a few months ago. 

I was in my cellar working on a wood project when I hit my thumb with a hammer. At the time I didn't think much of it but later on I noticed how badly I hurt my hand. I was bleeding pretty bad and my nail was partly torn off. Pretty gross.

As a total stim noob I have learned the hard way how ridiculously tolerance can build to this stuff and how quickly the bad starts to outweigh the good. I have been taking once or twice per week for functional purposes.


When I started, 10mg nasally would do the trick with a great motivation and mood boost to go along with it. Quickly this turned into 20mg. Eventually I realized I needed to switch to oral dosing to keep it functional, for which I needed about 40mg oral to get any useful effect. This soon turned into 50mg, and finally 50mg twice per day. More recently 60mg x 2.


I appreciate that these doses are small compared to most recreational uses, but even so, it's unsustainable for a few reasons:


1) Even when using only two days per week, tolerance keeps increasing, and so I need to keep pushing up the dose.


2) While it's still stimulating, there is no longer a mood & motivation boost (or if there is, it is *very* short lived, like 20 minutes!). In fact, I'm starting to notice some dysphoria. Previously it was all good.


3) There is a crash of serious lethargy (and sometimes irritability) on the following days. I can hardly call my use functional if I'm ruining my function on some days in trade for the others.


4) In spite of all this (or maybe because of the lethargic aftermath), I'm often tempted to do more, rather than less. D'oh.


Anyway, I know I'm not saying anything that anyone doesn't already know (in fact, that I had read about before I began). Just thought I'd share my naive experience.

Hi,


Usually I react in a good way to stimulant but yesterday I took 50mg orally of what should have be ethylphenidate. I felt a mild stimulation but now I feel like I was poisoned since 24 hours soon. I think I will feel good again in few hours but don't understand what happened.


I just took 50mg of 3-MMC as an allergy test the day before and was baseline when I ingested EPH. During my experience with EPH felt very hot and don't understand if it was cause of drug or because the guy under my flat set the heater at full power.

I'll give you strong advice that you stop using EPH (and all amphetamine-type drugs) right now, before it destroys you. Your physical reaction doesn't sound as bad as mine, but persisting with a drug based on the mentality that "it's *meant* to help people with my problems (therefore it will help me, somehow, eventually)" is an extremely dangerous way of thinking; you've already essentially taken the first step down the road of psychological addiction, and the longer this goes on, the worse it's going to get, as you start chasing dwindling benefits that were never really there to begin with, all while physical dependance insidiously creeps up on you. The ultimate irony here is that by being convinced that you need a drug you turn it into a self-fulfilling prophecy.


The most unfortunate and regrettable thing about this is that it's a pattern of thinking that's all-too-often propagated by doctors, who will Rx a patient a drug that's either ineffective or wrongly dosed, asserting that it MUST work, and dismissing patients' complaints when they say that it doesn't or produces unpleasant side-effects. In my experience, most doctors need to be a lot more receptive to their patients' grievances about the things they have to put in their bodies every day.

Yup.


Stimulant addiction is an insidious little bastard, with few downsides relative to benzo/opioids. Physically the biggest impact is the minor *fucking starvation* and depriving oneself of time for rest and neural growth... no biggie. 

Psychologically they destroy every sap of dignity, motivation, functionality and identity - all the while convincing you that you're fine.

Yeah, I would think ethylphen could be a pretty abusable stim.  When I tried it (I think I got like 10grams) I thought it was the most euphoric stim I ever tried and I don't normally like stims (I am prescribed 5x30mgs of adderall IR a day and hate taking it even though it does help with ADD/ADHD which I have- and no I know that is a high dose and don't just jam 150mgs down my neck when I take it ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) if I did that would explain the negative sides) but found ethylphen to have more of the dopamine effects and less of the body stim effects than any other stim I've ever tried (and have tried dexedrine, methylphen, amphetamine, cocaine, etc.) and was very very euphoric for a stim at least IV.  I didn't order more and this was like a year and a half ago but could easily see it becoming a big problem for someone really into stims.


I have heard it has a better dopamine to noradrenaline ratio of at least any common stim- I wonder if this is true?

I disagree...really I think stimulants are the opposite of insidious (and by "stimulants" I'm mostly referring to methamphetamine here, as that's the one I have the most experience with by far). You lose weight, don't sleep and by a few days you look like a piece of crap. ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png) A lot of people can tell when you're tweaked...they might not know it's from drugs but they know you look pretty fucked up. Whereas with opiates...you can maintain that for a good bit without people catching on...


As far as the physical addiction goes...well yeah it's not on the same level as a physical addiction to benzodiazepines, or even opiate withdrawal...but they're definitely more addictive than benzodiazepines, and unlike opiates meth is toxic for your body, so it's definitely not great on those levels


One thing I will say for stimulants is that they're definitely a cheaper habit compared to opiates.

I've noticed, and usually stim addictions are coke around here as meth is not real common on the streets (new england) unless they are getting RX stims or RCs (and I'm just assuming the RC part- no one I know like in person (well maybe 1 other person heard of them) knew anything about RCs), stimulant addictions seem more of a binge type addiction.  Get money, spend it all on coke, money goes quick, they think WTF? after and the same thing happens again a few days or week later.  As opposed to heroin (the BIG popular drug here) or other opioids which is a slowly building habit (1/2 gram might last people a couple days or at least a day at first and I'm guessing purity, as much as we've heard about it increasing, is probably only like 20% (think: I know plenty of people including myself who can shoot 1/2 gram at once and if it was 50% that would be 250mgs of diamorphine; definitely not impossible but I doubt it would be as common as it is)) where people need it everyday.

Hi mates i am new so sorry if I do something wrong and sorry about my grammar too i am not native english speaker ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) SWIM want tell you experience with EPH. 


**sex**-male

**age**-22

**weight**- 80 kg or maybe 160 in lbs i am not sure in my country we dont use lbs 

**SWIM drug experiences**- few times **meth** dont good for me too long duration and bad hangover **cocaine **used relatively often in 17-19 years old on parties 2-3 per month **opoids** medium-high experiences with tramadol codeine dihydrocodeine hydromorphone, high experiences with **anabolic steroids** **benzodiazepines **daily using 2-3 mg alprazolam cause emotional unstable disorder impuslive type combined with mild anxiety and sometimes depressive mood i was on lot of benzos alparazolam is best choice for me about 5 years of using benzo 

**SWIM physical condition **everything is ok every 3 months i go to check to my doctor for blood analysis (basic things like liver enzymes kidneys etc..)

**Daily used meds: Fluoxetin 20 mg alprazolam 2-3 mg


Now SWIM experience with EPH **SWIM got 1g of EPH powder was interested because its legal short acting which can help me to do things which i dont like when i am depressed mood especially in winter season maybe afectiv season disorder in summer when is lot of sun and light i dont have this problem or its very light. SWIM put 75 mg of EPH to pharma grade scale (accuracy 0,001g) Then made two similar lines and insufflated the powder not together first line and the second after 20 minutes. Now i will try it by timeline and more exactly. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) 

**T+00:00- **line burnt in SWIM nose like hell but it lasted only 10 seconds after 1-2 mins completly dissapeared

**T+00:10- **feeling some effect like strong good cafe with little bit mood lift and SWIM need to smoke some cigarette 

**T+00:20- **very pleasant mild euphoria with pleasant body warm feeling decided to snort another line 

**T+00:35 -**huge wave of stimulation i turn the music on it sounds really great bass going through all my body very nice i started cleaning all the house but i was really wierd o run to room to room and on every room i did something another :D but in my head that have logic :D

**T+1:30 -**euphoria is away but still pretty stimulated and weird but pleasant jittery at this time SWIM decided to drink some coffee and smoke 3 ciggaretes in row 

**T+1:50- **coffee and nicotine now looks like a big mistake now SWIM got anxious pretty nervous got i was sweating like in sauna and got unpleasant tremor to all my body taken 1,5 of xanax and some beta blocator and in 20 minutes it was relative fine i decided to not redose today.


**NEXT DAY**- SWIM wake up after 6-7 hours of light sleep i was very pretty surprised no hangover no comedown only sweaty palms and cold feet decided to take EPH again now lower dosage 60 mg splitted to 30 and 30mg lines and take with 1,25 bisoprolol

**

T+00:10- **pretty pleasant morning start a got motivated to day got some light breakfast eat multivitamin omega 3 acids and vitamin C  made a morning routine shower was very pleasant 

**T+00:30**- another line insufflated  and drink light coffee there is big craving for nicotine but previous experience shut it down fast SWIM decided wait with nicotine 

**T+00:45**- nice mood lift not euphoria in all way just saw world in positive way SWIM was much more friendly to others and talkative no jaw tension and other stimulant negatives tremor or tachycardia was killed by bisopropol i think still no nicotine 

**T+01:30- **still nice stimulation and good mood SWIM decided drink energy drink with tyrosine and finally got some cigarettes but only one it had pleasant effect to high 

**T+02:30- **mood going back to baseline but still takative and friendly seems to start wearing off 

**T+04:30-**effects slightly worn off nothing like hard comedown little bit tired and want to be alone to watch some movies/serials and chill out only little bit neck and back pain 


SWIM thinks is good RC would like to try isopropylphenidate later... SWIM like this stimulant cause of short time of half life (hated long duration for example afterglow of meth when euphoria stimulation was far away but still restless and just need to move) SWIM rating is 7/10 only because it looks like this RC builds tolerance quickly but if SWIM will be in depressive mood or tired/lethargic definitely use this SWIM thinks this is not much party drug cause it could be very anxious and redose for partying must pretty often SWIM think. Thanks for reading ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


sorry if you are missing more information about drip nassal pain SWIM think it is not important cause insufflation of any substance is unpleasant some more painful some less but in result nose only little bit swollen still normal relative comfort breathing through the nose no blood sneezing no pain only dry nostril its cause snorting of anything in past does not made SWIM problems with nose and after insufflation SWIM cleaned  nostril by snorting pure water from tea spoon and used some herbal based oil for irritated nose

I've only tried it with strong poppy tea but IME, yeah. When vaped I found it a lot like crack but a little milder. Good combo though, I'll definitely repeat it at one point. Actually it's probably the only way I'll use eph now since the comedown is so shitty.

I cannot speak to the eph and herion combo due to lack of experience combining them but I'm sure it could be nice. Atleast the herion could be used to soften the EPH comedown if nothing else.

I found vaped EPH to incredibly uncomfortable to the throat and lungs. It felt quite caustic. One could possibly achieve a decent rush from vaping EPH, but in my experience, it is so uncomfortable that it becomes too difficult to inhale enough vapor quickly enough to actually achieve a decent rush.


And back when I tried this, I was quite the stimulant fiend especially vaped stims (mdpv). The fact I tried vaping EPH and decided not to continue to do so says a lot to me now in retrospect. Usually nothing would get in my way; once I started vaping a stim I couldn't stop myself. Vaped EPH was the only exception, and only because I found it way too uncomfortable.


Of course, mmv. Obviously so, because you seem to enjoy it. What method are you using to vape? I tried vaping off of both foil and a light bulb. I used a regular lighter on the lowest setting and I tried my best not to burn it but it never mattered.

I vaped off foil and didn't have any issues at all, which was weird because I read a bunch of reports saying that it would taste awful at the very least, but it was actually pretty nice imo (sweet). I read here to put drugs on the matte side of the foil so maybe that helped? I was honestly surprised that I didn't have trouble vaping it because after literally one night of snorting it I had scabs on my septum and nosebleeds for a week and that's the first time that's ever happened to me from drugs. Maybe it's due to different batch impurities or something like that?
