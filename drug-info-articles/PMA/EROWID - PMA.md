DESCRIPTION #
 
PMA has been used as a recreational psychoactive (primarily in the 70s), at doses around 50 mg. Unfortunately, more often it has been sold as MDA or MDMA (ecstasy). The dosages for MDMA (80-160 mg) are significantly higher than those of PMA. At 60-80 mg, PMA can become extremely dangerous, causing increased blood temperature and blood pressure. In recent cases, PMA has been sold as ecstasy, in pressed pill form indistinguishable from ecstasy and at unknown dosages.

PMA Dosage
 
by Erowid
 
---
 
 
Pure PMA is a white powder, but forms found on the street can also be somewhat beige, pink, or yellowish. Recently is has been found most frequently in pressed pill form sold as MDMA (ecstasy). There is very little available information about safe recreational dosages for PMA. Doses as low as 60 mg can cause significant and alarming increase in blood pressure, body temperature and pulse. The most concerning aspect of this is that if PMA is sold as ecstasy, some people will take multiple pills, increasing chances of a PMA overdose significantly.

**PMA Health** 
 **by Erowid** 
**WARNINGS** : 
 
- **PMA, though quite rare, is occasionally sold as MDA or MDMA on the street.** 
 There were a number of cases in the mid 70's where PMA was sold as MDA, leading to several deaths and it appears that something similar may now be happening in various parts of the world. [Reports from Chicago](https://erowid.org/references/media/2000_chicago_1.shtml) (May 2000) have suggested that 2 recent deaths attributed to MDMA may have been cases of PMA sold as Ecstasy. Similarly, Australia seems to have had [several cases of PMA deaths](https://erowid.org/references/refs_view.php?ID=18) over the past few years. 
 
 **PMA is more dangerous than MDMA.** 
 At dosages from 60-80 mg (lower than those used regularly for Ecstasy), it can cause a sudden, large, and potentially fatal rise in blood temperature, body temperature and blood pressure. One of the recently reported deaths came after a young woman ingested 3 pills, not uncommon with ecstasy, but potentially deadly with PMA.
