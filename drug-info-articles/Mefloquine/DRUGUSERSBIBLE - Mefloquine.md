## Subjective Experience

There are a number of prescription drugs that can have deliriant, dissociative, or
even hallucinogenic side effects. Often these manifest at doses well beyond those
prescribed by medical practitioners, although not always. Generally I don’t consider
these to be psychoactive drugs per se, but rather, drugs that can produce a (usually
unwanted) psychoactive reaction in certain situations or for some people.

Mefloquine is a good case in point. It was first developed by the US military in the
1970s, and is used for both the prevention and treatment of malaria. However, its
use can come with a whole range of unpleasant contraindications. Relating to the
subject of this book, these can include the following:

```
"Psychiatric effects include nightmares, visual hallucinations, auditory
hallucinations, anxiety, depression, unusual behaviour, and suicidal
ideations." ~ Wikipedia
```
The time to peak concentration of this drug is widely cited as 6-24 hours, with a half-
life of two or three weeks. It does, therefore, appear to hang around in the system for
quite a long time, albeit at a lower or reducing concentration.

I was prescribed lariam prior to a trip to The Gambia in the early 90s. I can’t recall
my specific dose but I would assume that it was the generally prescribed 250mg
tablet. This is taken weekly, starting one week prior to departure. I still recall my
experience with it to this day. It was horrible.

In the background I felt a little weird; perhaps slightly distant or a bit off is a good
description, although this was definitely low level, and in truth, barely noticeable.
Unfortunately, this was only a prelude to the main event: lucid nightmares. These
were really disturbing in nature and they went on and on, and not just on the first
night (although this was the worst). The rest of my family, however, were totally
unaffected. I have no idea why I was susceptible and they weren’t.

Bizarre and often disturbing dreams though are relatively common. Quoting from an
article by the BBC, titled ‘My Lariam Dreams’ (https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-
33957717 ):

```
“But soon every Thursday morning (we took the weekly pill on a
Wednesday) was spent swapping stories about the hilarious, vivid, crazy -
almost hallucinogenic - mefloquine-infused dreams we'd experienced the
night before.”
```
Lest this should imply there is anything fun about taking lariam, I will refer to its
Wikipedia page again:

```
“Serious side effects include potentially long-term mental health problems
such as depression, hallucinations, and anxiety and neurological side effects
such as poor balance, seizures, and ringing in the ears.”
```
This is really not where you want to be, at all, so I would very strongly suggest that
this isn’t recreational and should only be taken if medically prescribed (and exactly
as medically prescribed). There can be psychoactive-like effects, there is a touch of
dissociation for some, but if a ride materialises it is frequently awful and the cost can
be extremely high (and has even been causally associated with fatalities). I would
now steer well clear of it, even if that meant changing my travel plans.

NOTE
Finally, why have I classified this drug as a dissociative, when it clearly isn't one? It is
here largely because it doesn’t fit well elsewhere either, and dissociative psychosis is
often cited as a potential side effect.
