## Overview

### Description

This compound belongs to the class of organic compounds known as fentanyls. These are compounds containing the fentanyl moiety or a derivative, which is based on a N-(1-(2-phenylethyl)-4-piperidinyl)-N-phenylpropanamide skeleton.

### Background

Fentanyl, a potent opioid agonist, was developed in the 1950s to fill a need for strong and rapid analgesia.
8
Because of these characteristics, fentanyl is commonly used to treat chronic cancer pain or in anesthesia.

Fentanyl is related to other opioids like
morphine
and
oxycodone
.
Fentanyl's high potency has also made it a common adulterant in illicit drugs, especially heroin.
8
In 2017, 47600 overdose deaths in the United States involved some opioid (over 2/3 of all overdose deaths).
22
Opioid overdoses kill an average of 11 Canadians daily.
23
Fentanyl was FDA approved in 1968.

### Indication

Fentanyl intravenous or intramuscular injections are indicated for short term analgesia during induction, maintenance, and recovery from general or regional anesthesia.
Label
These injections are also used with a neuroleptic for premedication, induction, and as an adjunct to maintenance of anesthesia.
Label
Finally, fentanyl intravenous or intramuscular injections are used with oxygen for anesthesia in high risk patients.
Label
Fentanyl sublingual tablets, transmucosal lozenges, buccal tablets, sublingual sprays, transdermal systems, and nasal sprays are indicated for the management of breakthrough pain in opioid tolerant cancer patients who require around the clock pain management.

### Pharmacodynamics

Fentanyl produces strong analgesia through its activation of opioid receptors.
Label
,
6
It has a duration of action of several hours and a wider therapeutic index as patients develop tolerance to opioids.
Label
Fentanyl is associated with a risk of addiction and abuse and should not be mixed with alcohol or benzodiazepines.

### Mechanism of action

Fentanyl binds to opioid receptors, especially the mu opioid receptor, which are coupled to G-proteins.
6
Activation of opioid receptors causes GTP to be exchanged for GDP on the G-proteins which in turn down regulates adenylate cyclase, reducing concentrations of cAMP.
6
Reduced cAMP decreases cAMP dependant influx of calcium ions into the cell.
6
The exchange of GTP for GDP results in hyperpolarization of the cell and inhibition of nerve activity.

## Subjective Experience

This is the only drug in this book which I didn’t self-administer, largely because of
the photograph on the following page and the unreliability of supply.

Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid which is 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine.
First synthesized in 1959, it was approved for medical use in the United States in

1968. Its effects resemble those of other drugs in this class, and are often considered
to be particularly close to those of heroin.

It has become synonymous with a huge wave of overdose fatalities, which began to
accelerate dramatically from circa 2013.

According to Wikipedia (2023): “fentanyl and its analogues have been responsible
for most drug overdose deaths in the United States, causing over 71,238 deaths in
2021 “.

Pharmaceutically a wide range of forms are available, including skin patches, pills
and nasal sprays (liquid), although on the street, powder is most commonly used. It
should be noted that fentanyl is often used as an adulterant in heroin and other
substances, which creates increased risk within the drug eco-system as a whole.

This isn’t one to use in combination with other psychoactives, and frankly, given the
current situation, it isn’t one to use at all. Indeed, at the time of writing this edition it
is voluntarily banned from the major darknet markets.

Should you proceed with this chemical despite the warnings here, it is suggested that
you have naloxone (NARCAN) readily and visibly available, that you use gloves for
handling and that you conscientiously adopt all the harm reduction measures,

If this picture doesn't paint a thousand words you are not paying attention. In part it
explains the wave of opioid related deaths which is currently sweeping the United
States. It also surely emphasises why the safety information in this book should be
common knowledge, rather than tucked away in the shadows.

Note that the photograph itself comes courtesy of the DEA (Drug Enforcement
Agency). On contacting them regarding its use, I asked if they would place it into the
public domain rather than simply grant permission to reproduce, as this would be
more likely to have a positive impact upon public health. Their response was
affirmative. Credit where it's due...

**U.S. FEDERAL LEGAL SUMMARY**
**Fentanyl**
- REGULATED: Yes
- STATUS: Scheduled
- SCHEDULE: Schedule II
- CLASSIFICATION: Opiate
 
Fentanyl is Schedule II in the United States. This means it is illegal to sell without a DEA license and illegal to buy or possess without a license or prescription.
 
INTERNATIONAL LAW #
 
Australia #
 
Fentanyl is a border controlled substance under Criminal Code Act 9.1.314 and is additionally controlled by several states and territories. (thanks Z)
 
Canada #
 
Fentanyl is schedule I in Canada. (Note: Canadian schedules are very different than U.S. schedules). In at least some parts of Ontario, those prescribed fentanyl patches must return their used patches in order to receive prescription refills. See [http://www.pcchu.ca/2014/02/18/local-healthcare-providers-collaborate-to-address-misuse-of-fentanyl-in-peterborough/](http://www.pcchu.ca/2014/02/18/local-healthcare-providers-collaborate-to-address-misuse-of-fentanyl-in-peterborough/) and [http://www.mykawartha.com/news-story/4905577-fentanyl-patch-program-aims-to-reduce-accidental-overdoses/](http://www.mykawartha.com/news-story/4905577-fentanyl-patch-program-aims-to-reduce-accidental-overdoses/) . One visitor tells us that this policy will be implemented for all of Ontario as of Jan 1, 2015, but we've been unable to find confirmation of that. (thanks G) (last updated Oct 13 2014)

**Fentanyl** (also known as **Fentanil** and by the brand names **Sublimaze** , **Actiq** , **Durogesic** , **Duragesic** , **Fentora** , **Matrifen** , **Haldid** , **Onsolis** , **Instanyl** , **Abstral** , **Lazanda** among others ) is a potent [opioid](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioid) substance of the [anilidopiperidine](/w/index.php?title=Anilidopiperidine&action=edit&redlink=1) class. It is a strong [agonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist) at the [μ-opioid](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/%CE%9C-opioid) [receptors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Receptors) and approximately 40 to 50 times more potent than pharmaceutical grade (i.e. 100% pure) [heroin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Heroin) and roughly 80 to 100 times more potent than [morphine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Morphine) . [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

A wide range of pharmaceutical fentanyl preparations are available, including transdermal skin patches, lollipops, buccal tablets or patches, nasal sprays, and inhalers. On the street, it is typically encountered in powder form, where it is often cut into or sold as heroin and other drugs, which has resulted in numerous accidental overdoses and fatalities. In 2016, fentanyl and analogues were the most common cause of overdose deaths in the United States at more than 20,000, about half of all opioid-related deaths.

[Subjective effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effects) are similar to those of [heroin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Heroin) and includes [pain relief](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pain_relief) (analgesia), [sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation) , [respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression) , and [euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Euphoria) . However, it has a rapid [onset](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Onset) and short [duration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Duration) of action relative to other opioids, which can lead to [compulsive redosing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Compulsive_redosing) . Additionally, many users report noticeably less [euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Euphoria) with fentanyl and its analogs. As a result, it is generally considered to have lower recreational value.

Fentanyl is a highly dangerous substance due its addictiveness and the difficulty with which it can be safely dosed, a result of its incredible potency. Users are advised to be aware of the extreme risk they are placing themselves in if they choose to use fentanyl. It is also highly advised to use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Harm_reduction_practices) if a user chooses to do fentanyl. Users are also advised to test all of their opioids (and substances in general) for fentanyl and other adulterants using [reagent testing kits](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Reagent_testing_kits) .

## History and culture

Fentanyl was first synthesized by Paul Janssen in 1960 following the medical inception of pethidine several years earlier. Janssen developed fentanyl by assaying analogues of the structurally related substance pethidine for opioid activity. The widespread use of fentanyl triggered the production of fentanyl citrate which entered the clinical practice as a general anesthetic under the trade name Sublimaze in the 1960s. Following this, many other fentanyl analogues were developed and introduced into medical practice, including sufentanil, alfentanil, remifentanil, and carfentanil.

In the mid-1990s, fentanyl was first introduced for widespread palliative use with the clinical introduction of the Duragesic patch. It was followed in the next decade by the introduction of the first quick-acting prescription formulations of fentanyl for personal use, the Actiq lollipop and Fentora buccal through the delivery method of estradiol Mylan transdermal patches. As of 2012, fentanyl was the most widely used synthetic opioid in clinical practice with several new delivery methods now available, including a sublingual spray for cancer patients. In 2013, 1700 kilograms were used globally.

## Chemistry

Fentanyl is a member of the [anilidopiperidine](/w/index.php?title=Anilidopiperidine&action=edit&redlink=1) class of synthetic [opioids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioids) . Its structure features a [piperidine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Piperidine) ring bound at its nitrogen constituent R N to a phenyl ring through an ethyl chain. The opposite carbon of the piperidine ring is bonded to the nitrogen member of a propanamide group, a three carbon chain with a nitrogen constituent adjacent to a carbon bonded to a ketone oxygen. This propanamide group is also substituted with an additional phenyl ring at R N .

## Pharmacology

The recreational effects of fentanyl occur because opioids structurally mimic endogenous endorphins which are naturally found within the body and also work upon the μ-opioid receptor set. The way in which opioids structurally mimic these natural endorphins results in their [euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria) , [pain relief](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pain_relief) and [anxiolytic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiolytic) effects. This is because endorphins are responsible for reducing pain, causing sleepiness, and feelings of pleasure. They can be released in response to pain, strenuous exercise, orgasm, or general excitement.

Fentanyl's strong potency compared to that of morphine is mainly due to its high [lipophilicity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipophilicity) (the ability of a chemical compound to dissolve in fats, oils, and lipids). Because of this, it can more easily penetrate the central nervous system in comparison to other opioids.

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation)** - Fentanyl can be described as much more sedating then other opiates. Even at moderate dosages, fentanyl can result in overwhelming feelings of sedation and tiredness that is considerably more sedating than that of [heroin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Heroin) and [oxycodone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Oxycodone) .
- **[Pain relief](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pain_relief)** - In comparison to other opiates, fentanyl can be described as a strong analgesic, providing relief even at non-recreational doses.
- **[Physical euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria)** - Fentanyl can be considered as less intense in its physical euphoria when compared with that of [morphine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Morphine) or [diacetylmorphine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Diacetylmorphine) (heroin). The sensation itself can be described as strong feelings of intense physical comfort, warmth and bliss which spread throughout the body.
- **[Itchiness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Itchiness)** - Unlike other [opioids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioids) , fentanyl presents very little itch response due to little to no amounts of released [histamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Histamines) .
- **[Respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression)** - In comparison to other opiates, fentanyl displays this effect at lower doses relative to euphoria than other opiates, and even at low doses results in the sensation that the breath is slowed down mildly to moderately, but does not cause noticeable impairment. At high doses and overdoses, opioid-induced respiratory depression can result in a shortness of breath, abnormal breathing patterns, semi-consciousness, or unconsciousness. Severe overdoses can result in a coma or death without immediate medical attention.
- **[Constipation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Constipation)**
- **[Cough suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cough_suppression)**
- **[Decreased libido](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Decreased_libido)**
- **[Difficulty urinating](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Difficulty_urinating)**

- - **[Cognitive euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_euphoria)** - Fentanyl can be considered less intense in its cognitive euphoria when compared with that of [morphine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Morphine) or [heroin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Diacetylmorphine) . It is still, however, capable of extreme intensity and overwhelming bliss at heavier dosages with a low tolerance. The sensation itself can be described as powerful and overwhelming feeling of emotional bliss, contentment, and happiness.

## Toxicity and harm potential

Non-medical use of fentanyl by individuals without opiate tolerance can be very dangerous and has resulted in numerous deaths. It is potentially fatal at heavy dosages and even those with opiate tolerances are at high risk for overdoses. Once the fentanyl is in the user's system, it is extremely difficult to stop its course because of the nature of absorption. Because of the extremely high strength of pure fentanyl powder, it is very difficult to dilute appropriately, and often the resulting mixture may be far too strong and, therefore, very dangerous. It is also potentially [lethal](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression) when mixed with [depressants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressants) like [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) or [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) .

Like most opioids, pure fentanyl at appropriate dosages does not cause many long-term complications other than dependence and [constipation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Constipation) . Outside of the extremely powerful addiction and physical dependence, the harmful or toxic aspects of opioid usage are exclusively associated with not taking the necessary precautions in regards to its administration, overdosing and using impure products.

Fentanyl is very potent and around 1000 times more permeable than morphine. Even though fentanyl uptake through skin is rather slow , unintentionally transporting the substance from the skin by touching the mouth, nose or eyes is dangerous.

Heavy dosages of fentanyl can result in [respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression) , leading onto fatal or dangerous levels of anoxia (oxygen deprivation). This occurs because the breathing reflex is suppressed by [agonism](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonists) of [µ-opioid](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/%CE%9C-opioid) [receptors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Receptors) proportional to the dosage consumed.

Fentanyl can also cause nausea and vomiting; a significant number of deaths attributed to opioid overdose are caused by aspiration of vomit by an unconscious victim. This is when an unconscious or semi-conscious user who is lying on their back vomits into their mouth and unknowingly suffocates. It can be prevented by ensuring that one is lying on their side with their head tilted downwards so that the airways cannot be blocked in the event of vomiting while unconscious (also known as the [recovery position](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Recovery_position) ). In the case of an overdose, it is advised to administer a dose of [naloxone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Naloxone) intravenously or intramuscularly to counteract the effects of the substance.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this substance.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

As with other [opioids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioids) , the chronic use of fentanyl can be considered extremely addictive with a high potential for abuse and is capable of causing psychological and physical dependence among certain users. When addiction has developed, cravings and [withdrawal symptoms](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioids#Discontinuation) may occur if a person suddenly stops their usage.

Tolerance to many of the effects of fentanyl develops with prolonged and repeated use. The rate at which this occurs develops at different rates for different effects, with tolerance to the constipation-inducing effects developing particularly slowly for instance. This results in users having to administer increasingly large doses to achieve the same effects. After that, it takes about 3 - 7 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 1 - 2 weeks to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). Fentanyl presents cross-tolerance with all other [opioids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioids) , meaning that after the consumption of fentanyl all [opioids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioid) will have a reduced effect.

The risk of fatal opioid overdoses rise sharply after a period of cessation and [relapse](/w/index.php?title=Relapse&action=edit&redlink=1) , largely because of reduced tolerance. To account for this lack of tolerance, it is safer to only dose a fraction of one's usual [dosage](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dosage) if relapsing. It has also been found that the environment one is in can play a role in opioid tolerance. In one scientific study, rats with the same history of heroin administration were significantly more likely to die after receiving their dose in an environment not associated with the substance in contrast to a familiar environment.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **Alcohol** - Both substances potentiate the ataxia and sedation caused by the other and can lead to unexpected loss of consciousness at high doses. Place affected patients in the recovery position to prevent vomit aspiration from excess. Memory blackouts are likely
- **Stimulants** - Stimulants increase respiration rate which allows for a higher dose of opiates than would otherwise be used. If the stimulant wears off first then the opiate may overcome the user and cause respiratory arrest.
- **Benzodiazepines** - Central nervous system and/or respiratory-depressant effects may be additively or synergistically present. The two substances potentiate each other strongly and unpredictably, very rapidly leading to unconsciousness. While unconscious, vomit aspiration is a risk if not placed in the recovery position blackouts/memory loss likely.
- **DXM** - Generally considered to be toxic. CNS depression, difficulty breathing, heart issues, and liver toxicity have been observed. Additionally if one takes DXM, their tolerance of opiates goes down slightly, thus causing additional synergistic effects.
- **GHB** / **GBL** - The two substances potentiate each other strongly and unpredictably, very rapidly leading to unconsciousness. While unconscious, vomit aspiration is a risk if not placed in the recovery position
- **Ketamine** - Both substances bring a risk of vomiting and unconsciousness. If the user falls unconscious while under the influence there is a severe risk of vomit aspiration if they are not placed in the recovery position.
- **MAOIs** - Coadministration of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) with certain opioids has been associated with rare reports of severe adverse reactions. There appear to be two types of interaction, an excitatory and a depressive one. Symptoms of the excitatory reaction may include agitation, headache, diaphoresis, hyperpyrexia, flushing, shivering, myoclonus, rigidity, tremor, diarrhea, hypertension, tachycardia, seizures, and coma. Death has occurred in some cases.
- **MXE** - MXE can potentiate the effects of opioids but also increases the risk of respiratory depression and organ toxicity.
- **Nitrous** - Both substances potentiate the ataxia and sedation caused by the other and can lead to unexpected loss of consciousness at high doses. While unconscious, vomit aspiration is a risk if not placed in the recovery position. Memory blackouts are common.
- **PCP** - PCP may reduce opioid tolerance, increasing the risk of overdose.
- **Tramadol** - Increased risk of seizures. Tramadol itself is known to induce seizures and it may have additive effects on seizure threshold with other opioids. Central nervous system- and/or respiratory-depressant effects may be additively or synergistically present.
- **Grapefruit** - While grapefruit is not psychoactive, it may affect the metabolism of certain opioids. Tramadol, oxycodone, and fentanyl are all primarily metabolized by the enzyme CYP3A4, which is potently inhibited by grapefruit juice . This may cause the drug to take longer to clear from the body. it may increase toxicity with repeated doses. Methadone may also be affected . Codeine and hydrocodone are metabolized by CYP2D6. People who are on medicines that inhibit CYP2D6, or that lack the enzyme due to a genetic mutation will not respond to codeine as it can not be metabolized into its active product: morphine.

#### Serotonin syndrome risk

Combinations with the following substances can cause dangerously high [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) levels. [Serotonin syndrome](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome) requires immediate medical attention and can be fatal if left untreated.

- **MAOIs** - Such as [banisteriopsis caapi](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Banisteriopsis_caapi) , [syrian rue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Syrian_rue) , phenelzine, selegiline, and moclobemide.
- **Serotonin releasers** - Such as [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) , [4-FA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-FA) , [methamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) , [methylone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylone) and [αMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/%CE%91MT) .
- **SSRIs** - Such as citalopram and sertraline
- **[SNRIs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SNRIs)** - Such as [tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol) and venlafaxine
- **5-HTP**

## Effects
Fentanyl has a strong analgesic and sedative effect and is effective in the smallest doses. However, its euphoric effect is less pronounced than that of other opioids. It is used in emergency medicine for surgical procedures and anesthesia, and for breakthrough pain in cancer patients. For chronic pain, fentanyl patches are used, which release the active ingredient slowly. Due to its opioid properties, fentanyl rapidly leads to dependence when taken over a long period of time and should not be discontinued abruptly and only under medical supervision.

## Dosage
Fentanyl is extremely potent and therefore very difficult to dose. Therefore, overdoses can easily occur. When consuming for the first time, low doses should be used, as the risk of respiratory arrest is increased.

## Risks

### Short-term Risks
The side effects are strongly dose-dependent. As the dose increases, the side effects also become more pronounced. At the beginning there is often drowsiness, dizziness, dizziness, pupil constriction, slowed heartbeat, drop in blood pressure, nausea and vomiting.
Excessive sweating, rashes, itching, central dullness, confusion, visual disturbances, cardiac arrhythmias, respiratory reflex depression and urinary retention may also occur.
Overdoses with fentanyl are life-threatening because the substance, like all opioids, slows down breathing, even to the point of respiratory arrest and coma.

### Long-term Risks
Regular, abusive use of fentanyl can lead to dependence with severe withdrawal symptoms such as seizures, sleep disorders and depression. Withdrawal, as with all opioids, should not be abrupt and should only take place under medical supervision.

## Safer Use
- Opioids are highly effective drugs that should only be used for a limited time and at best under medical supervision.
- Start with a low dose and wait for the effect and tolerance before adding more. Do not exceed the maximum daily dose.
- If you inject opioids, dose even more carefully, as the range between desired effect (rush) and dangerous overdose is even more difficult to assess. Avoid injecting fentanyl; the risk of overdose is particularly high. Always use new (clean and sterile) injection material! Never exchange syringes, filters, water, disinfection swabs to avoid transmission of hepatitis and HIV.
- Do not rely on dosage information from colleagues who regularly use opioids. Due to habituation or dependence, their doses are much higher and can be fatal for new users.
- Take longer breaks (at least several days) between consumption.
- After a period of abstinence, take a much lower dose! The usual dose before the abstinence phase can otherwise quickly have life-threatening consequences.
- The simultaneous consumption of depressant substances such as alcohol, ketamine, GHB/GBL, nitrous oxide, benzodiazepines and/or other opioids is dangerous as there is an increased risk of vomiting and unconsciousness. The risk of suffocation is high!
- Refrain from citrus fruits (especially grapefruit) before or during consumption. The combination can lead to an increase in the effect of the opiate and/or to respiratory depression.

Dr. Mark Lysyshyn is a medical health officer with Vancouver Coastal Health in British Columbia, Canada. The Vancouver region, like many parts of North America, has been strongly affected by the rise in opioid-related fatalities. Dr. Lysyshyn is among those working to reduce fatalities by researching and expanding harm reduction tools.

He recently co-authored a study looking at drug checking for fentanyl at Insite, a supervised consumption facility. It found a very high prevalence of fentanyl in heroin samples and also showed users do change their behavior, primarily by reducing their dose, when they know their drugs contain fentanyl. This suggests expanding the availability of drug checking could give users actionable information that will reduce overdoses.

*Source: https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/Fentanyl*

**Fentanyl** is a synthetic opiate analgesic with a rapid onset and short duration of action.  It is a strong agonist at the μ-opioid receptors and is historically used to treat breakthrough pain.  Fentanyl is approximately 100 times more potent than morphine, and is commonly used as a patch.  The patches work by releasing fentanyl into body fats, which then slowly release the drug into the bloodstream over 48 to 72 hours, allowing for long-lasting relief from pain.

## History

Fentanyl was first synthesized by Paul Janssen in 1960.  Fentanyl was introduced in patch form in the mid 1990s, shortly followed by lollipop form.  As of 2012 fentanyl was the most widely used synthetic opioid in clinical practice.

## Dosage

Approximately 100 micrograms of fentanyl is equivalent to 10mg of morphine. Rate of absorption is dependent on a number of factors. Body temperature, skin type, amount of body fat, and placement of the patch can have major effects.  Fentanyl is available as a patch, nasal spray, lollipop lozenge (brand name Actiq, or colloquially "percopop"), or inhaler.

### Patch

Bioavailability: varies per manufacturer; there is higher ba in the enclosed-satchel (such as Sandoz) vs the adhesive-matrix (such as Mylan) patches. The difficulty with ba in patches is separating the drug from the adhesive or carrier. It is difficult to extract a dose from either vehicle with sufficient accuracy to prevent harm in a recreational setting.

Comeup time: 20 to 60 minutes.

Duration: 24 to 72 hours; varies based upon ambient temperature, body temperature, skin salinity and perspiration, location of patch (volume of adipose tissue under the dermis), type of patch, dosage of patch. Most tolerant users will find 24 hours to be about the limit whereas naive users will more likely see 72 hours. 

Medium (typical) dose: 50μg/hr + (depending on tolerance)

Patches are available in doses ranging from 12.5μg/hr to 100μg/hr, with patches previously available at strengths to 200μg/hr having been discontinued. Total fentanyl content of these patches are 1.25mg to 10mg; not all of this is available to the body from the patch and would have to be extracted using e.g., ethanol for "complete" usage.

The patch may be taken orally (sublingually) by sectioning into doses (such as 1/10th of a 10mg patch being 1mg delivered), but it is not recommended, and requires a solvent such as overproof ethanol for sufficient absorption.

### Insufflated

Fentanyl powder may be snorted, but it is not recommended.

### Smoked

The gel inside patches can be smoked. The powder also may be smoked, although it is not recommended.

### Injected

Fentanyl is most commonly prepared in a saline solution with lactose or inositol as a buffering agent and either sold as heroin or as fentanyl itself. Fentanyl is not commonly available by itself as a powder and has low potential for abuse due to the low margin of safety with microgram-scale dosages.

## Effects

The effects of fentanyl are similar to that of heroin.

### Positive

- Analgesia
- Euphoria
- Feelings of relaxation

### Neutral

- Sedative effects
- Changes in focus, attention

### Negative

- Respiratory depression
- Diarrhoea
- Nausea
- Constipation
- Dry Mouth
- Somnolence
- Confusion
- Weakness
- Sweating
- Headache
- Fatigue
- Dizziness
- Nervousness
- Anxiety
- Urinary retention
- Hallucinations

### After effects

- Risk of post-acute withdrawal effects, diarrhea including depression, anxiety disorder, psychosis, or even suicidal ideation in extreme cases

## Harm Reduction

Fentanyl is considered one of the safest opioid medications on the market, as well as the least physically harmful to the body with long-term or life-term use.  Still, fentanyl has caused overdoses and deaths, especially when mixed with other drugs.  

Illicitly synthesized fentanyl powder has also appeared on the United States market. Because of the extremely high strength of pure fentanyl powder, it is very difficult to dilute appropriately, and often the resulting mixture may be far too strong and, consequently, very dangerous.

Sometimes fentanyl is sold as heroin.  Some dealers may mix fentanyl powder with heroin to increase potency or compensate for low-quality heroin. If you have any concerns about your drug, please test it.

- Avoid driving and operating heavy machinery

- Risk of Post-acute withdrawal effects

- Strong addiction potential due to short effects

- Risk of overdose/death

## Chemistry and Pharmacology

Fentanyl is a potent μ-opioid receptor agonist with relatively little effect on κ or δ receptors compared to most opioids. Being very lipid soluble, it penetrates the blood-brain barrier quickly and efficiently, which accounts for its high potency compared to traditional opioids. When taken orally, fentanyl undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism by CYP3A4 to non-active metabolites, and as such, CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as grapefruit juice) could potentially be very dangerous when coadministered with fentanyl.

## Legal status

In most countries, fentanyl is illegal to sell without a license and illegal to buy or possess without a license or prescription. 

- Europe: [http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/customs/l33215_en.htm](http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/customs/l33215_en.htm)

*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fentanyl*

Fentanyl is a highly potent synthetic opioid of the piperidine family, used primarily as pain medication. It is 30 to 50 times more potent than heroin and 100 times more potent than morphine. Its primary clinical use is in pain management for cancer patients and those recovering from surgery. Fentanyl is also used as a sedative for intubated patients. Depending on the method of delivery, fentanyl can be very fast acting and ingesting a small quantity can cause overdose. Fentanyl works by activating μ-opioid receptors. Fentanyl is sold under the brand names Actiq, Duragesic, and Sublimaze, among others.
Pharmaceutical fentanyl's adverse effects are similar to those of other opioids and narcotics, including addiction, confusion, respiratory depression (which, if extensive and untreated, may lead to respiratory arrest), drowsiness, nausea, visual disturbances, dyskinesia, hallucinations, delirium (including narcotic delirium), narcotic ileus, muscle rigidity, constipation, loss of consciousness, hypotension, coma, and death. Alcohol and other drugs (e.g., cocaine and heroin) can synergistically exacerbate fentanyl's side effects. Naloxone and naltrexone are opioid antagonists that reverse the effects of fentanyl.
Fentanyl was first synthesized by Paul Janssen in 1960 and was approved for medical use in the United States in 1968. In 2015, 1,600 kilograms (3,500 pounds) were used in healthcare globally. As of 2017, fentanyl was the most widely used synthetic opioid in medicine; in 2019, it was the 278th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than a million prescriptions. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines.
Fentanyl is contributing to an epidemic of synthetic opioid drug overdose deaths in the United States. From 2011 to 2021, deaths from prescription opioid (natural and semi-synthetic opioids and methadone) per year remained stable, while synthetic opioid (primarily fentanyl) deaths per year increased from 2,600 overdoses to 70,601. Since 2018, fentanyl and its analogues have been responsible for most drug overdose deaths in the United States, causing over 71,238 deaths in 2021. Fentanyl constitutes the majority of all drug overdose deaths in the United States since it overtook heroin in 2018. The United States National Forensic Laboratory estimates fentanyl reports by federal, state, and local forensic laboratories increased from 4,697 reports in 2014 to 117,045 reports in 2020. Fentanyl is often mixed, cut, or ingested alongside other drugs, including cocaine and heroin. Fentanyl has been reported in pill form, including pills mimicking pharmaceutical drugs such as oxycodone. Mixing with other drugs or disguising as a pharmaceutical makes it difficult to determine the correct treatment in the case of an overdose, resulting in more deaths. In an attempt to reduce the number of overdoses from taking other drugs mixed with fentanyl, drug testing kits, strips, and labs are available. Fentanyl's ease of manufacture and high potency makes it easier to produce and smuggle, resulting in fentanyl replacing other abused narcotics and becoming more widely used.

## Medical uses

### Anesthesia

Intravenous fentanyl is often used for anesthesia and as an analgesic. To induce anesthesia, it is given with a sedative like propofol or thiopental. To maintain anesthesia, inhaled anesthetics and additional fentanyl may be used. These are often given in 15–30 minute intervals throughout procedures such as endoscopy and surgeries and in emergency rooms.
For pain relief after surgery, use can decrease the amount of inhalational anesthetic needed for emergence from anesthesia. Balancing this medication and titrating the drug based on expected stimuli and the person's responses can result in stable blood pressure and heart rate throughout a procedure and a faster emergence from anesthesia with minimal pain.

### Regional anesthesia

Fentanyl is the most commonly used intrathecal opioid because its lipophilic profile allows a quick onset of action (5–10 min) and intermediate duration of action (60–120 min). Spinal administration of hyperbaric bupivacaine with fentanyl may be the optimal combination. The almost immediate onset of fentanyl reduces visceral discomfort and even nausea during the procedure.

### Obstetrics

Fentanyl is sometimes given intrathecally as part of spinal anesthesia or epidurally for epidural anesthesia and analgesia. Because of fentanyl's high lipid solubility, its effects are more localized than morphine, and some clinicians prefer to use morphine to get a wider spread of analgesia. It is widely used in obstetrical anesthesia because of its short time to action peak (about 5 minutes), the rapid termination of its effect after a single dose, and the occurrence of relative cardiovascular stability. In obstetrics, the dose must be closely regulated to prevent large amounts of transfer from mother to fetus. At high doses, the drug may act on the fetus to cause neonatal withdrawal. For this reason, shorter-acting agents such as alfentanyl or remifentanil may be more suitable in the context of inducing general anesthesia.

### Pain management

The bioavailability of intranasal fentanyl is about 70–90% but with some imprecision due to clotted nostrils, pharyngeal swallow, and incorrect administration. For both emergency and palliative use, intranasal fentanyl is available in doses of 50, 100, 200, 400(PecFent) μg. In emergency medicine, safe administration of intranasal fentanyl with a low rate of side effects and a promising pain-reducing effect was demonstrated in a prospective observational study in about 900 out-of-hospital patients.
In children, intranasal fentanyl is useful for the treatment of moderate and severe pain and is well tolerated. Furthermore, a 2017 study suggested the efficacy of fentanyl lozenges in children as young as five, weighing as little as 13 kg. Lozenges are more inclined to be used as the child is in control of sufficient dosage, in contrast to buccal tablets.

#### Chronic pain

It is also used in the management of chronic pain. Often, transdermal patches are used. The patches work by slowly releasing fentanyl through the skin into the bloodstream over 48 to 72 hours, allowing for long-lasting pain management. Dosage is based on the size of the patch, since, in general, the transdermal absorption rate is constant at a constant skin temperature. Each patch should be changed every 72 hours. Rate of absorption is dependent on a number of factors. Body temperature, skin type, amount of body fat, and placement of the patch can have major effects. The different delivery systems used by different makers will also affect individual rates of absorption, and route of administration. Under normal circumstances, the patch will reach its full effect within 12 to 24 hours; thus, fentanyl patches are often prescribed with a fast-acting opioid (such as morphine or oxycodone) to handle breakthrough pain. It is unclear if fentanyl gives long-term pain relief to people with neuropathic pain.

#### Breakthrough pain

Sublingual fentanyl dissolves quickly and is absorbed through the sublingual mucosa to provide rapid analgesia. Fentanyl is a highly lipophilic compound, which is well absorbed sublingually and generally well tolerated. Such forms are particularly useful for breakthrough cancer pain episodes, which are often rapid in onset, short in duration, and severe in intensity.

#### Palliative care

In palliative care, transdermal fentanyl patches have a definitive, but limited role for:

people already stabilized on other opioids who have persistent swallowing problems and cannot tolerate other parenteral routes such as subcutaneous administration.
people with moderate to severe kidney failure.
troublesome side effects of oral morphine, hydromorphone, or oxycodone.
When using the transdermal patch, patients must be careful to minimize or avoid external heat sources (direct sunlight, heating pads, etc.), which can trigger the release and absorption of too much medication and cause potentially deadly complications.

#### Combat medicine

USAF Pararescue combat medics in Afghanistan used fentanyl lozenges in the form of lollipops on combat casualties from IED blasts and other trauma. The stick is taped to a finger and the lozenge put in the cheek of the person. When enough fentanyl has been absorbed, the (sedated) person generally lets the lollipop fall from the mouth, indicating sufficient analgesia and somewhat reducing the likelihood of overdose and associated risks.

#### Breathing difficulties

Fentanyl is used to help relieve shortness of breath (dyspnea) when patients cannot tolerate morphine, or whose breathlessness is refractory to morphine. Fentanyl is useful for such treatment in palliative care settings where pain and shortness of breath are severe and need to be treated with strong opioids. Nebulized fentanyl citrate is used to relieve end-of-life dyspnea in hospice settings.

### Other

Some routes of administration such as nasal sprays and inhalers generally result in a faster onset of high blood levels, which can provide more immediate analgesia but also more severe side effects, especially in overdose. The much higher cost of some of these appliances may not be justified by marginal benefit compared with buccal or oral options. Intranasal fentanyl appears to be equally effective as IV morphine and superior to intramuscular morphine for the management of acute hospital pain.
A fentanyl patient-controlled transdermal system (PCTS) is under development, which aims to allow patients to control the administration of fentanyl through the skin to treat postoperative pain. The technology consists of a "preprogrammed, self-contained drug-delivery system" that uses electrotransport technology to administer on-demand doses of 40 μg of fentanyl hydrochloride over ten minutes. In a 2004 experiment including 189 patients with moderate to severe postoperative pain up to 24 hours after major surgery, 25% of patients withdrew due to inadequate analgesia. However, the PCTS method proved superior to the placebo, showing lower mean VAS pain scores and having no significant respiratory depression effects.

## Adverse effects

Fentanyl's most common side effects, which affect more than 10% of people, include nausea, vomiting, constipation, dry mouth, somnolence, confusion, and asthenia (weakness). Less frequently, in 3–10% of people, fentanyl can cause abdominal pain, headache, fatigue, anorexia and weight loss, dizziness, nervousness, anxiety, depression, flu-like symptoms, dyspepsia (indigestion), shortness of breath, hypoventilation, apnoea, and urinary retention. Fentanyl use has also been associated with aphasia. Despite being a more potent analgesic, fentanyl tends to induce less nausea, as well as less histamine-mediated itching, than morphine. In rare cases, serotonin syndrome is associated with fentanyl use. Existing studies advise medical practitioners to exercise caution when combining selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) drugs with fentanyl.
The duration of action of fentanyl has sometimes been underestimated, leading to harm in a medical context. In 2006, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) began investigating several respiratory deaths, but doctors in the United Kingdom were not warned of the risks with fentanyl until September 2008. The FDA reported in April 2012 that twelve young children had died and twelve more had become seriously ill from separate accidental exposures to fentanyl skin patches.

### Respiratory depression

The most dangerous adverse effect of fentanyl is respiratory depression, that is, decreased sensitivity to carbon dioxide leading to reduced rate of breathing, which can cause anoxic brain injury or death. This risk is decreased when the airway is secured with an endotracheal tube (as during anesthesia). This risk is higher in specific groups, like those with obstructive sleep apnea.
Other factors that increase the risk of respiratory depression are:

High fentanyl doses
Simultaneous use of methadone
Sleep
Older age
Simultaneous use of CNS depressants like benzodiazepines (i.e. alprazolam, diazepam, clonazepam), barbiturates, alcohol, and inhaled anesthetics
Hyperventilation
Decreased CO2 levels in the serum
Respiratory acidosis
Decreased fentanyl clearance from the body
Decreased blood flow to the liver
Renal insufficiency
Sustained release fentanyl preparations, such as patches, may also produce unexpected delayed respiratory depression. The precise reason for sudden respiratory depression is unclear, but there are several hypotheses:

Saturation of the body fat compartment in people with rapid and profound body fat loss (people with cancer, cardiac or infection-induced cachexia can lose 80% of their body fat).
Early carbon dioxide retention causes cutaneous vasodilation (releasing more fentanyl), together with acidosis, which reduces the protein binding of fentanyl, releasing yet more fentanyl.
Reduced sedation, losing a useful early warning sign of opioid toxicity and resulting in levels closer to respiratory-depressant levels.
Another related complication of fentanyl overdoses includes the so-called wooden chest syndrome, which quickly induces complete respiratory failure by paralyzing the thoracic muscles, explained in more detail in the Muscle rigidity section below.

### Heart and blood vessels

Bradycardia: Fentanyl decreases the heart rate by increasing vagal nerve tone in the brainstem, which increases the parasympathetic drive.
Vasodilation: It also vasodilates arterial and venous blood vessels through a central mechanism, by primarily slowing down vasomotor centers in the brainstem. To a lesser extent, it does this by directly affecting blood vessels. This is much more profound in patients who have an already increased sympathetic drive, like patients who have high blood pressure or congestive heart failure. It does not affect the contractility of the heart when regular doses are administered.

### Muscle rigidity

If high boluses of fentanyl are administered quickly, muscle rigidity of the vocal cords can make bag-mask ventilation very difficult. The exact mechanism of this effect is unknown, but it can be prevented and treated using neuromuscular blockers.

#### Wooden chest syndrome

A prominent idiosyncratic adverse effect of fentanyl also includes a sudden onset of rigidity of the abdominal muscles and the diaphragm, which induces respiratory failure; this is seen with high doses and is known as wooden chest syndrome. The syndrome is believed to be the main cause of death as a result of fentanyl overdoses.
Wooden chest syndrome is reversed by naloxone and is believed to be caused by a release of noradrenaline, which activates α-adrenergic receptors and also possibly via activation of cholinergic receptors.
Wooden chest syndrome is unique to the most powerful opioids—which today comprise fentanyl and its analogs—while other less-powerful opioids like heroin produce mild rigidity of the respiratory muscles to a much lesser degree.

## Overdose

Fentanyl poses an exceptionally high overdose risk in humans since the amount required to cause toxicity is unpredictable. In its pharmaceutical form, most overdose deaths attributed solely to fentanyl occur at serum concentrations at a mean of 0.025 μg/mL, with a range 0.005–0.027 μg/mL. In contexts of poly-substance use, blood fentanyl concentrations of approximately 0.007 μg/mL or greater have been associated with fatalities. Over 85% of overdoses involved at least one other drug, and there was no clear correlation showing at which level the mixtures were fatal. The dosages of fatal mixtures varied by over three magnitudes in some cases.
Naloxone (sold under the brand name Narcan) can completely or partially reverse an opioid overdose. In July 2014, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) of the UK issued a warning about the potential for life-threatening harm from accidental exposure to transdermal fentanyl patches, particularly in children, and advised that they should be folded, with the adhesive side in, before being discarded. The patches should be kept away from children, who are most at risk from fentanyl overdose. In the US, fentanyl and fentanyl analogs caused over 29,000 deaths in 2017, a large increase over the previous four years.

Some increases in fentanyl deaths do not involve prescription fentanyl but are related to illicitly made fentanyl that is being mixed with or sold as heroin. Death from fentanyl overdose continues to be a public health issue of national concern in Canada since September 2015. In 2016, deaths from fentanyl overdoses in the province of British Columbia averaged two persons per day. In 2017 the death rate increased by more than 100% with 368 overdose-related deaths in British Columbia between January and April 2017.

Fentanyl has started to be mixed into illicitly manufactured opioids and benzodiazepines. Fentanyl contamination in cocaine, methamphetamine, ketamine, MDMA, and other drugs is common. A kilogram of heroin laced with fentanyl may sell for more than US\$100,000, but the fentanyl itself may be produced far more cheaply, for about US\$6,000 per kilogram. While Mexico and China are the primary source countries for fentanyl and fentanyl-related substances trafficked directly into the United States, India is emerging as a source for finished fentanyl powder and fentanyl precursor chemicals. The United Kingdom illicit drug market is no longer reliant on China, as domestic fentanyl production is replacing imports.
The intravenous dose causing 50% of opioid-naive experimental subjects to die (LD50) is "3 mg/kg in rats, 1 mg/kg in cats, 14 mg/kg in dogs, and 0.03 mg/kg in monkeys." The LD50 in mice has been given as 6.9 mg/kg by intravenous administration, 17.5 mg/kg intraperitoneally, 27.8 mg/kg by oral administration. The LD50 in humans is unknown. 
In 2023, overdose deaths in the U.S. and Canada again reached record numbers. While overdoses involving fentanyl in the United States have decreased in 2024, the overall percentage of overdoses involving fentanyl has remained stable between 70% and 80% from 2021-2024. According to a 2023 report from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), the increased numbers of deaths are not related to an increased number of users but to the lethal effects of fentanyl itself. In an article published by Los Alamos National Laboratory, researchers state, "Because of the very high strength of pure fentanyl powder, it's hard to dilute precisely, so small inaccuracies in weight can cause huge variation between batches, and it's all too easy for someone to get too much."

Fentanyl would require a special status as it is considerably more toxic than other widely abused opioids and opiates. Overdose deaths in pediatric cases are also concerning. In a report published in JAMA Pediatrics, 37.5% of all fatal pediatric cases between 1999 and 2021 were related to fentanyl; most of the deaths were among adolescents (89.6%) and children aged 0 to 4 years (6.6%). According to the UNODC, "the opioid crisis in North America is unabated, fueled by an unprecedented number of overdose deaths."

### Prevention

Public health advisories to prevent fentanyl misuse and fatal overdose have been issued by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC). An initial HAN Advisory, also known as a Health Alert Network Advisory ("provides vital, time-sensitive information for a specific incident or situation; warrants immediate action or attention by health officials, laboratorians, clinicians, and members of the public; and conveys the highest level of importance") was issued during October 2015. A subsequent HAN Alert was issued in July 2018, warning of rising numbers of deaths due to fentanyl abuse and mixing with non-opioids. A December 2020 HAN Advisory warned of:

substantial increases in drug overdose deaths across the United States, primarily driven by rapid increases in overdose deaths involving ... illicitly manufactured fentanyl; a concerning acceleration of the increase in drug overdose deaths, with the largest increase recorded from March 2020 to May 2020, coinciding with the implementation of widespread mitigation measures for the COVID-19 pandemic; significant increases in overdose deaths involving methamphetamine.
81,230 drug overdose deaths occurred during the 12 months from May 2019 to May 2020, the largest number of drug overdoses for a 12-month interval ever recorded for the U.S. The CDC recommended the following four actions to counter this rise:

Local need to expand the distribution and use of naloxone and overdose prevention education,
Expand awareness, access, and availability of treatment for substance use disorders,
Intervene early with individuals at the highest risk for overdose, and
improve detection of overdose outbreaks to facilitate more effective response.
In Arizona, a counterfeit fentanyl pill costs between \$1-\$3. Another initiative is a social media campaign from the United States Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) called "One Pill Can Kill". This social media campaign's goal is to spread awareness of the prevalence of counterfeit pills that are being sold in America that is leading to the large overdose epidemic in America. This campaign also shows the difference between counterfeit pills and real pills.

## Pharmacology

### Classification

Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid in the phenylpiperidine family, which includes sufentanil, alfentanil, remifentanil, and carfentanil. Some fentanyl analogues, such as carfentanil, are up to 10,000 times stronger than morphine.

### Structure-activity

The structures of opioids share many similarities. Whereas opioids like codeine, hydrocodone, oxycodone, and hydromorphone are synthesized by simple modifications of morphine, fentanyl, and its relatives are synthesized by modifications of meperidine. Meperidine is a fully synthetic opioid, and other members of the phenylpiperidine family like alfentanil and sufentanil are complex versions of this structure.
Like other opioids, fentanyl is a weak base that is highly lipid-soluble, protein-bound, and protonated at physiological pH. All of these factors allow it to rapidly cross cellular membranes, contributing to its quick effect in the body and the central nervous system.

### Fentanyl analogs

Fentanyl analogs are types of fentanyl with various chemical modifications on any number of positions of the molecule, but still maintain, or even exceed, its pharmacological effects. Many fentanyl analogs are termed "designer drugs" because they are synthesized solely to be used illicitly. Carfentanil, a fentanyl analog, has an additional methyl ester group attached to the 4 position. Carfentanil is 20–30 times as potent as fentanyl and is common in the illicit drug chain. The drug is commonly used to tranquilize elephants and other large animals.

### Mechanism of action

Fentanyl, like other opioids, acts on opioid receptors. These receptors are G-protein-coupled receptors, which contain seven transmembrane portions, intracellular loops, extracellular loops, intracellular C-terminus, and extracellular N-terminus. The extracellular N-terminus is important in differentiating different types of binding substrates. When fentanyl binds, downstream signaling leads to inhibitory effects, such as decreased cAMP production, decreased calcium ion influx, and increased potassium efflux. This inhibits the ascending pathways in the central nervous system to increase pain threshold by changing the perception of pain; this is mediated by decreasing propagation of nociceptive signals, resulting in analgesic effects.
As a μ-receptor agonist, fentanyl binds 50 to 100 times more potently than morphine. It can also bind to the delta and kappa opioid receptors but with a lower affinity. It has high lipid solubility, allowing it to penetrate more easily the central nervous system. It attenuates "second pain" with primary effects on slow-conducting, unmyelinated C-fibers and is less effective on neuropathic pain and "first pain" signals through small, myelinated A-fibers.
Fentanyl can produce the following clinical effects strongly, through μ-receptor agonism:

Supraspinal analgesia (μ1)
Respiratory depression (μ2)
Physical dependence
Muscle rigidity
It also produces sedation and spinal analgesia through Κ-receptor agonism.

### Therapeutic effects

Pain relief: Primarily, fentanyl provides the relief of pain by acting on the brain and spinal μ-receptors.
Sedation: Fentanyl produces sleep and drowsiness, as the dosage is increased, and can produce the δ-waves often seen in natural sleep on electroencephalogram.
Suppression of the cough reflex: Fentanyl can decrease the struggle against an endotracheal tube and excessive coughing by decreasing the cough reflex, becoming useful when intubating people who are awake and have compromised airways. After receiving a bolus dose of fentanyl, people can also experience paradoxical coughing, which is a phenomenon that is not well understood.

### Detection in biological fluids

Fentanyl may be measured in blood or urine to monitor for abuse, confirm a diagnosis of poisoning, or assist in a medicolegal death investigation. Commercially available immunoassays are often used as initial screening tests, but chromatographic techniques are generally used for confirmation and quantitation. The Marquis Color test may also be used to detect the presence of fentanyl. Using formaldehyde and sulfuric acid, the solution will turn purple when introduced to opium drugs. Blood or plasma fentanyl concentrations are expected to be in a range of 0.3–3.0 μg/L in persons using the medication therapeutically, 1–10 μg/L in intoxicated people, and 3–300 μg/L in victims of acute overdosage. Paper spray-mass spectrometry (PS-MS) may be useful for initial testing of samples.

### Detection for harm reduction purposes

Fentanyl and fentanyl analogues can be qualitatively detected in drug samples using commercially available fentanyl testing strips or spot reagents. Following the principles of harm reduction, this test is to be used directly on drug samples as opposed to urine. To prepare a sample for testing, approximately 10 mg of the drug should be diluted into 1 teaspoon, or 5 mL, of water. Research in Dr. Lieberman's lab at the University of Notre Dame has reported false positive results on BTNX fentanyl testing strips with methamphetamine, MDMA, and diphenhydramine. The sensitivity and specificity of fentanyl test strips vary depending on the concentration of fentanyl tested, particularly from 10 to 250 ng/mL.

## Synthesis

Fentanyl is a 4-anilinopiperidine class synthetic opioid. The synthesis of Fentanyl is accomplished by one of four main methods as reported in the scientific literature: the Janssen, Siegfried, Gupta, or Suh method.

### Janssen

The original synthesis as patented in 1964 by Paul Janssen involves the synthesis of benzylfentanyl from N-benzyl-4-piperodone. The resulting benzylfentanyl is used as feedstock to norfentanyl. It is norfentanyl that forms fentanyl upon reaction with a phenethyl halide.

### Siegfried

The Siegfried method, initially described in 1978 and later published on The Hive, involves the initial synthesis of N-phenethyl-4-piperidone (NPP). This intermediate is reductively aminated to 4-anilino-N-phenethylpiperidine (4-ANPP). Fentanyl is produced following the reaction of 4-ANPP with an acyl chloride. The Siegfried method was used in the early 2000s to illicitly manufacture fentanyl in the USA and other countries.

### Gupta

The Gupta (or 'one-pot') method starts from 4-piperidone and skips the direct use of 4-ANPP/NPP; rather, the compounds are formed only as impurities or temporary intermediates. For the first half of 2021, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration found the Gupta method was the predominant synthesis route in their samples of seized fentanyl. In 2022, Braga and coworkers described a synthesis of fentanyl involving continuous flow with photoredox catalysis that uses reagents similar to the ones described for the Gupta procedure.

### Suh

The Suh (or 'total synthesis') method skips the direct use of piperidine precursors in favor of creating the ring system in situ.

## History

Fentanyl was first synthesized in Belgium by Paul Janssen under the label of his relatively newly formed Janssen Pharmaceutica in 1959. It was developed by screening chemicals similar to pethidine (Demerol) for opioid activity. The widespread use of fentanyl triggered the production of fentanyl citrate (the salt formed by combining fentanyl and citric acid in a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio). Fentanyl citrate entered medical use as a general anesthetic in 1968, manufactured by McNeil Laboratories under the brand name Sublimaze.
In the mid-1990s, Janssen Pharmaceutica developed and introduced into clinical trials the Duragesic patch, which is a formulation of an inert alcohol gel infused with select fentanyl doses, which are worn to provide constant administration of the opioid over 48 to 72 hours. After a set of successful clinical trials, Duragesic fentanyl patches were introduced into medical practice.
Following the patch, a flavored lollipop of fentanyl citrate mixed with inert fillers was introduced in 1998 under the brand name Actiq, becoming the first quick-acting formation of fentanyl for use with chronic breakthrough pain.
In 2009, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Onsolis (fentanyl buccal soluble film), a fentanyl drug in a new dosage form for cancer pain management in opioid-tolerant subjects. It uses a medication delivery technology called BEMA (BioErodible MucoAdhesive), a small dissolvable polymer film containing various fentanyl doses applied to the inner lining of the cheek.
Fentanyl has a US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) Administrative Controlled Substances Code Number (ACSCN) of 9801. Its annual aggregate manufacturing quota has significantly reduced in recent years from 2,300,000 kg in 2015 and 2016 to only 731,452 kg in 2021, a nearly 68.2% decrease.

## Society and culture

### Legal status

Effective from 1 May 2019, China officially classified all forms of fentanyl as controlled narcotics.
In the UK, fentanyl is classified as a controlled Schedule II, Class A drug under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971.
In the Netherlands, fentanyl is a List I substance of the Opium Law.
In the US, fentanyl is a Schedule II controlled substance per the Controlled Substances Act. Distributors of Abstral are required to implement an FDA-approved risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) program. In order to curb misuse, many health insurers have begun to require precertification and/or quantity limits for Actiq prescriptions.
In Canada, fentanyl is considered a schedule I drug as listed in Canada's Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. Some fentanyl precursors, such as the piperidones (after October 2023) have been banned under its Precursor Control Regulations, which have been in place at least since November 2016.
Estonia is known to have been home to the world's longest documented fentanyl epidemic, especially following the Taliban ban on opium poppy cultivation in Afghanistan.
A 2018 report by The Guardian indicated that many major drug suppliers on the dark web have voluntarily banned the trafficking of fentanyl.
The fentanyl epidemic has erupted in a highly acrimonious dispute between the U.S. and Mexican governments. While U.S. officials blame the flood of fentanyl crossing the border primarily on Mexican crime groups, then-President Andrés Manuel López Obrador insisted that the main source of this synthetic drug is Asia. He stated that the crisis of a lack of family values in the United States drives people to use the drug.

### Recreational use

Illicit use of pharmaceutical fentanyl and its analogues first appeared in the mid-1970s in the medical community and continues in the present. More than 12 different analogues of fentanyl, all unapproved and clandestinely produced, have been identified in the U.S. drug traffic. In February 2018, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration indicated that illicit fentanyl analogs have no medically valid use, and thus applied a "Schedule I" classification to them.
Fentanyl analogues may be hundreds of times more potent than heroin. Fentanyl is used orally, smoked, snorted, or injected. Fentanyl is sometimes sold as heroin or oxycodone, which can lead to overdose. Many fentanyl overdoses are initially classified as heroin overdoses. Recreational use is not particularly widespread in the EU except for Tallinn, Estonia, where it has largely replaced heroin. Estonia has the highest rate of 3-methylfentanyl overdose deaths in the EU, due to its high rate of recreational use.
Fentanyl is sometimes sold on the black market in the form of transdermal fentanyl patches such as Duragesic, diverted from legitimate medical supplies. The gel from inside the patches is sometimes ingested or injected.
Another form of fentanyl that has appeared on the streets is the Actiq lollipop formulation. The pharmacy retail price ranges from US\$15 to US\$50 per unit based on the strength of the lozenge, with the black market cost ranging from US\$5 to US\$25 in 2007, depending on the dose. The attorneys general of Connecticut and Pennsylvania have launched investigations into its diversion from the legitimate pharmaceutical market, including Cephalon's "sales and promotional practices for Provigil, Actiq and Gabitril."
Non-medical use of fentanyl by individuals without opioid tolerance can be very dangerous and has resulted in numerous deaths. Even those with opiate tolerances are at high risk for overdoses. Like all opioids, the effects of fentanyl can be reversed with naloxone, or other opiate antagonists. Naloxone is increasingly available to the public. Long-acting or sustained-release opioids may require repeat dosage. Illicitly synthesized fentanyl powder has also appeared on the United States market. Because of the extremely high strength of pure fentanyl powder, it is very difficult to dilute appropriately, and often the resulting mixture may be far too strong and, therefore, very dangerous.
Some heroin dealers mix fentanyl powder with heroin to increase potency or compensate for low-quality heroin. In 2006, illegally manufactured, non-pharmaceutical fentanyl often mixed with cocaine or heroin caused an outbreak of overdose deaths in the United States and Canada, heavily concentrated in the cities of Dayton, Ohio; Chicago, Illinois; Detroit, Michigan; and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

### Enforcement

The fentanyl supply chain in Mexico consists of a vast and elusive network, potentially involving hundreds of players. U.S. and Mexican anti-narcotics officials acknowledge that the exact number is unknown. Some brokers operate as specialists within major cartels, while others act independently. However, the majority remain unknown to authorities and operate below the radar. A major challenge in disrupting this trade lies in the global chemical industry. Many of the compounds used to manufacture fentanyl have legitimate industrial applications, classifying them as dual-use chemicals. These substances are often unregulated or only lightly controlled in key countries such as the United States, Mexico, and China. This regulatory gap enables brokers to evade detection, seamlessly navigating between the legal chemical trade and the illicit drug market to acquire the necessary precursors.
Several large quantities of illicitly produced fentanyl have been seized by U.S. law enforcement agencies. In November 2016, the DEA uncovered an operation making counterfeit oxycodone and Xanax from a home in Cottonwood Heights, Utah. They found about 70,000 pills in the appearance of oxycodone and more than 25,000 in the appearance of Xanax. The DEA reported that millions of pills could have been distributed from this location over the course of time. The accused owned a tablet press and ordered fentanyl in powder form from China. A seizure of a record amount of fentanyl occurred on 2 February 2019, by U.S. Customs and Border Protection in Nogales, Arizona. The 254 pounds (115 kg) of fentanyl, which was estimated to be worth US\$3.5M, was concealed in a compartment under a false floor of a truck transporting cucumbers. The "China White" form of fentanyl refers to any of a number of clandestinely produced analogues, especially α-methylfentanyl (AMF). One US Department of Justice publication lists "China White" as a synonym for a number of fentanyl analogues, including 3-methylfentanyl and α-methylfentanyl, which today are classified as Schedule I drugs in the United States. Part of the motivation for AMF is that, despite the extra difficulty from a synthetic standpoint, the resultant drug is more resistant to metabolic degradation. This results in a drug with an increased duration.
In June 2013, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a health advisory to emergency departments alerting to 14 overdose deaths among intravenous drug users in Rhode Island associated with acetylfentanyl, a synthetic opioid analog of fentanyl that has never been licensed for medical use. In a separate study conducted by the CDC, 82% of fentanyl overdose deaths involved illegally manufactured fentanyl, while only 4% were suspected to originate from a prescription.
Beginning in 2015, Canada has seen several fentanyl overdoses. Authorities suspected that the drug was being imported from Asia to the western coast by organized crime groups in powder form and being pressed into pseudo-OxyContin tablets. Traces of the drug have also been found in other recreational drugs, including cocaine, MDMA, and heroin. The drug has been implicated in the deaths of people from all walks of life—from homeless individuals to professionals—including teens and young parents. Because of the rising deaths across the country, especially in British Columbia where 1,716 deaths were reported in 2020 and 1,782 from January to October 2021, Health Canada is putting a rush on a review of the prescription-only status of naloxone in an effort to combat overdoses of the drug. In 2018, Global News reported allegations that diplomatic tensions between Canada and China hindered cooperation to seize imports, with Beijing being accused of inaction.
Fentanyl has been discovered for sale in illicit markets in Australia in 2017 and in New Zealand in 2018. In response, New Zealand experts called for wider availability of naloxone.
In May 2019, China regulated the entire class of fentanyl-type drugs and two fentanyl precursors. Nevertheless, it remains the principal origin of fentanyl in the United States: Mexican cartels source fentanyl precursors from Chinese suppliers such as Yuancheng Group, which are finished in Mexico and smuggled to the United States. Following the 2022 visit by Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan, China halted cooperation with the United States on combatting drug trafficking. Bilateral talks on fentanyl later resumed in San Francisco in 2023 when then U.S. President Joe Biden and CCP General Secretary Xi Jinping met. In the past several months before February 2025, China had also began scheduling fentanyl precursors that are internationally banned, aligning with efforts to restrict the flow of chemicals used in fentanyl production as well as the drug itself. These actions are intended to strengthen efforts to curb drug trafficking and disrupt the supply chain more effectively. In February 2025, US president Trump imposed a 10% tariff on Chinese imports, claiming the move as a way "to pressure China into taking action on fentanyl" but experts have expressed concern that these tariffs could reverse the progress made under the Biden administration and weaken the international cooperation necessary to combat global drug trafficking.
India has also emerged as a source of fentanyl and fentanyl precursors, where Mexican cartels have already developed networks for the import of synthetic drugs. It is possible that fentanyl and precursor production may disperse to other countries, such as Nigeria, South Africa, Indonesia, Myanmar, and the Netherlands.
In 2020, the Myanmar military and police confiscated 990 gallons of "methyl fentanyl" [sic], as well as precursors for the illicit synthesis of the drug. According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, the Shan State of Myanmar has been identified as a major source for fentanyl derivatives. In 2021, the agency reported a further drop in opium poppy cultivation in Burma, as the region's synthetic drug market continues to expand and diversify.
In 2023, a California police union director was charged with importing synthetic opioids, including fentanyl and tapentadol disguised as chocolate. U.S. law enforcement had been slow in their response to the fentanyl crisis, according to the Washington Post. The response by the federal government to the fentanyl crisis had also faltered, according to the press release. Overdose deaths by fentanyl and other illegally imported opioids were surging since 2019 and are presently a major cause of death in all U.S. states.
According to the national archives and the DEA, direct fentanyl shipments from China have stopped since 2022. The majority of illicit fentanyl and analogues now entering the U.S. from Mexico are final products in form of "tablets" and adulterated heroin from previously synthesized fentanyl. From the sophistication of full fentanyl synthesis and acute toxicity in laboratory environments, 'clandestine' labs in Mexico relate to making an illicit dosage form from available fentanyl rather than the synthesis itself. Based on further research by investigators, fentanyl and analogues are likely synthesized in labs that have the appearance of a legal entity, or are diverted from pharmaceutical laboratories.
Recent investigations and convictions of members of the Sinaloa drug cartel by federal agencies made a clear connection between illegal arms trafficking from the U.S. to Mexico and the smuggling of fentanyl into the U.S. Mexico had repeatedly made official complaints since illegal guns are easily purchased for example in Arizona and as far north as Wisconsin and even Alaska, according to U.S. intelligence sources, and transported onto Mexican territory through a chain of American brokers and couriers often financed by those drug cartels that also engage in money laundering. Therefore, the lack of arms controls in the U.S. has directly contributed to the U.S. opioid overdose crisis. 
The opioid epidemic in the United States is largely fueled by drugs smuggled from Mexico; approximately 98% of fentanyl entering the U.S. comes from Mexico. In January 2025, President Trump said that tariffs on Mexico were intended to reduce the U.S. trade deficit and force the country to secure its border with the U.S. against fentanyl smuggling and illegal immigration.

### Brand names

Brand names include Sublimaze, Actiq, Durogesic, Duragesic, Fentora, Matrifen, Haldid, Onsolis, Instanyl, Abstral, Lazanda and others.

### Economics

In the United States, the 800 mcg tablet was 6.75 times more expensive as of 2020 than the lozenge. As of 2023, the average cost for an injectable fentanyl solution (50 mcg/mL) is around US\$17 for a supply of 20 milliliters, depending on the pharmacy. In a 2020 report by the Australian Institute of Criminology, a 100-microgram transdermal patch was valued from between AU\$75 and AU\$450 on illicit markets. Furthermore, in another 2020 study, the average price per gram of non-pharmaceutical fentanyl on various cryptomarkets was US\$1,470.40 for offerings of less than five grams; the average for offers over five grams was US\$139.50. In addition, on DreamMarket furanfentanyl (Fu-F), the most common analog on said market, the average price per gram was US\$243.10 for retail listings and US\$26.50 per gram for wholesale listings.

### Storage and disposal

The fentanyl patch is one of a few medications that may be especially harmful, and in some cases fatal, with just one dose, if misused by a child. Experts have advised that any unused fentanyl patches be kept in a secure location out of children's sight and reach, such as a locked cabinet.
In British Columbia, Canada, where there are environmental concerns about toilet flushing or garbage disposal, pharmacists recommend that unused patches be sealed in a child-proof container that is then returned to a pharmacy. In the United States where patches cannot always be returned through a medication take-back program, flushing is recommended for fentanyl patches, because it is the fastest and surest way to remove them from the home to prevent ingestion by children, pets or others not intended to use them.

### Governmental usage

In August 2018, Nebraska became the first American state to use fentanyl to execute a prisoner. Carey Dean Moore, then one of the longest-serving death row inmates in the United States, was executed at the Nebraska State Penitentiary. Moore received a lethal injection, administered as an intravenous series of four drugs that included fentanyl citrate, to inhibit breathing and render the subject unconscious. The other drugs included diazepam as a tranquilizer, cisatracurium besylate as a muscle relaxant, and potassium chloride to stop the heart. The use of fentanyl in execution caused concern among death penalty experts because it was part of a previously untested drug cocktail. The execution was also protested by anti-death penalty advocates at the prison during the execution and later at the Nebraska State Capitol.
Russian Spetsnaz security forces are suspected to have used a fentanyl analogue, or derivative (suspected to be carfentanil and remifentanil), to rapidly incapacitate people in the Moscow theater hostage crisis in 2002. The siege was ended, but many hostages died from the gas after their health was severely taxed during the days long siege. The Russian Health Minister later stated that the gas was based on fentanyl, but the exact chemical agent has not been clearly identified.

## Veterinary use

Fentanyl is commonly used for analgesia and as a component of balanced sedation and general anesthesia in small animal patients. Fentanyl's short-acting nature, wide safety profile, lower rate of adverse effect compared to other opioids, and high potency make it one of the most effective and common analgesics in veterinary medicine; fentanyl's ability to reduce the minimum alveolar concentration leads to it being commonly used in dogs that are elderly or have cardiovascular issues. Due to fentanyl's short duration and quick onset it is commonly used as a constant rate infusion or as a transdermal patch, with the latter being able to last 3 to 4 days. Fentanyl can provide sedation for dogs. Fentanyl is less common and has more adverse effects in livestock and equine compared to cats and dogs. In horses at analgesic doses tachycardia, restlessness, and excitement occur. Subcutaneous administration often causes pain due but a bicarbonate solution exists which does not cause pain when giving subcutaneously.
Fentanyl is highly lipophilic, about 1000 times more than morphine. In dogs it has low protein binding of 15.6% and a half-life of 2–6 hours. In cats the half-life is 2.5 hours. Fentanyl has poor oral bio-availability due to it being metabolised by the liver. Transdermal and transmucosal formulations are common for out-patients, although the latter's efficacy is not well supported by evidence.
