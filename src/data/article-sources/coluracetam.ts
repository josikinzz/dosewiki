**Coluracetam** ( **BCI-540** ; formerly **MKC-231** ) is a [nootropic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nootropic) belonging to the [racetam](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Racetam) family of drugs. It was originally developed and tested by the Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corporation for Alzheimer's disease. After the drug had failed to reach the endpoints in its clinical trials, it was in-licensed by BrainCells Inc for investigations into major depressive disorder (MDD), which was preceded by being awarded a "Qualifying Therapeutic Discovery Program Grant" by the state of California. Findings from phase IIa clinical trials have suggested that it would be a possible medication for a comorbid major depressive disorder (MDD) with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD).

Colouracetam is easily available and sold through online vendors as a dietary supplement in the United States. Dose for dose colouracetam's potency is nearly twice that of [noopept](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Noopept) , making it require lower amounts while offering many similar effects. Due to its short acting and acute nature, the preferred [ROAs](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Routes_of_administration) are generally [insufflation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Insufflation) , [sublingual](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sublingual) , or [vaporisation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vaporisation) , though it is still active orally.

The active dose range of this compound is between 5 and 20mg. This is much smaller than comparable doses of the racetam class of drugs ( [piracetam](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Piracetam) , [oxiracetam](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Oxiracetam) , [phenylpiracetam](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenylpiracetam) , etc.). Dosages higher than 20mg do not seem to offer any additional benefit.

## Chemistry

Coluracetam, or N-(2,3-Dimethyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofuro[2,3-b]quinolin-4-yl)-2-(2-oxo-1-pyrrolidinyl)acetamide, is a synthetic compound of the [racetam](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Racetam) family. Racetams share a [pyrrolidine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pyrrolidine) nucleus, a five-member nitrogenous ring with a ketone bonded oxygen at R 2 . This 2-pyrrolidone ring is bound to the terminal carbon of an acetamide group, an ethyl amide chain with a ketone bond (C=O) at the alpha carbon.

Coluracetam features an additional three-ring substituted fluoroquinolone component bonded to R N of the acetamide group. The fluoroquinolone group is comprised of a central nitrogenous pyridine ring fused to a benzyl and furan ring on either side. Two methyl groups are bonded to R 2 and R 3 of the structure on the furan ring. Coluracetam is structurally analogous to [piracetam](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Piracetam) with an added fluoroquinolone group.

## Pharmacology

Coluracetam enhances high-affinity [choline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Choline) uptake (HACU), which is the rate-limiting step of [acetylcholine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Acetylcholine) (ACh) synthesis. This process essentially allows acetylcholine to accumulate at higher levels than normal. As acetylcholine is involved in the function of memory, this could potentially account for its [nootropic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nootropic) effects.

## Subjective effects

In comparison to the effects of other nootropics such as [noopept](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Noopept) , this compound can be described as focusing primarily on physical stimulation over that of cognitive stimulation. ***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)** - The stimulation which coluracetam presents can be considered as primarily subtle and short lasting, comparable to that of [caffeine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Caffeine) . ### Sensory effects
 
- A prominent experience amongst coluracetam's effects is its ability to enhance the immediate five senses. 
- **[Acuity enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Acuity_enhancement)**
- **[Colour enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_enhancement)**
- **[Auditory enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_enhancement)**
- **[Mindfulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mindfulness)**
- **[Tactile enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_enhancement)** ### Cognitive effects
 
- - **[Wakefulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness)**
- **[Anxiety suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety_suppression)**
- **[Thought connectivity](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_connectivity)**
- **[Focus enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Focus_enhancement)**
- **[Immersion enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Immersion_enhancement)**
- **[Motivation enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motivation_enhancement)**
- **[Memory enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Memory_enhancement)**
- **[Dream potentiation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dream_potentiation)**
### Experience reports

There are currently no anecdotal reports which describe the effects of this compound within our [experience index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Experience_index) . Additional experience reports can be found here:

- [Erowid Experience Vaults: Coluracetam](https://www.erowid.org/experiences/subs/exp_Coluracetam.shtml)

## Toxicity and harm potential

The toxicity and long-term health effects of recreational coluracetam use do not seem to have been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dosage is unknown. This is because coluracetam has very little history of human use. Anecdotal evidence from people who have tried coluracetam within the community suggests that there do not seem to be any negative health effects attributed to simply trying this drug at low to moderate doses by itself and using it sparingly (but nothing can be completely guaranteed).

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this substance.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

The chronic use of Coluracetam can be considered as not addictive with a low potential for abuse. It does not appear to be capable of causing psychological dependence among certain users.

Tolerance to many of the effects of Coluracetam develops with prolonged and repeated use. This results in users having to administer increasingly large doses to achieve the same effects. After that, it takes about 3 - 7 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 1 - 2 weeks to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). Coluracetam may presents cross-tolerance with all [racetam](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Racetam) [nootropics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nootropic) , meaning that after the consumption of Coluracetam certain [nootropics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nootropics) such as [aniracetam](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Aniracetam) and [piracetam](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Piracetam) may have a reduced effect.

### Dangerous Interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **Depressants** ( *[1,4-Butanediol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/1,4-Butanediol) , [2M2B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2M2B) , [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) , [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) , [barbiturates](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Barbiturates) , [GHB](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GHB) / [GBL](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GBL) , [methaqualone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methaqualone) , [opioids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioids)* ) - This combination potentiates the [muscle relaxation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_relaxation) , [amnesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amnesia) , [sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation) , and [respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression) caused by one another. At higher doses, it can lead to a sudden, unexpected loss of consciousness along with a dangerous amount of depressed respiration. There is also an increased risk of suffocating on one's vomit while unconscious. If [nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea) or vomiting occurs before a loss of consciousness, users should attempt to fall asleep in the [recovery position](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Recovery_position) or have a friend move them into it.
- **Dissociatives** - This combination can unpredictably potentiate the [amnesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amnesia) , [sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation) , [motor control loss](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motor_control_loss) and [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) that can be caused by each other. It may also result in a sudden loss of consciousness accompanied by a dangerous degree of [respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression) . If [nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea) or vomiting occurs before consciousness is lost, users should attempt to fall asleep in the [recovery position](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Recovery_position) or have a friend move them into it.
- **Stimulants** - Stimulants mask the [sedative](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation) effect of depressants, which is the main factor most people use to gauge their level of intoxication. Once the stimulant effects wear off, the effects of the depressant will significantly increase, leading to intensified [disinhibition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Disinhibition) , [motor control loss](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motor_control_loss) , and dangerous [black-out states](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amnesia) . This combination can also potentially result in severe dehydration if one's fluid intake is not closely monitored. If choosing to combine these substances, one should strictly limit themselves to a pre-set schedule of dosing only a certain amount per hour until a maximum threshold has been reached.

## Legal status

Coluracetam, being a member of the [racetam](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Racetam) family, currently is legally available to buy and sell in most countries, but may still vary by region.

- **United Kingdom** - Coluracetam and other racetams are prescription-only drugs; however, there is no penalty for possession or importing them.

Coluracetam (INN; development code BCI-540; formerly MKC-231) is a purported nootropic agent of the racetam family.  It contains a chemical group that is a bioisostere of the 9-amino-tetrahydroacridine family. It was initially developed and tested by the Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corporation for Alzheimer's disease. After the drug failed to reach endpoints in its clinical trials it was in-licensed by BrainCells Inc for investigations into major depressive disorder (MDD), which was preceded by being awarded a "Qualifying Therapeutic Discovery Program Grant" by the state of California. Findings from phase IIa clinical trials have suggested that it would be a potential medication for comorbid MDD with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD).  BrainCells Inc is currently out-licensing the drug for this purpose. It may also have potential use in prevention and treatment of ischemic retinopathy and retinal and optic nerve injury.
Coluracetam has been shown to reverse the loss of choline acetyltransferase production in the medial septal nucleus of rats exposed to phencyclidine (PCP), and is considered a potential therapeutic drug for schizophrenia.

## Mechanism of action

Coluracetam enhances high-affinity choline uptake (HACU), which is the rate-limiting step of acetylcholine (ACh) synthesis. Studies have shown coluracetam to improve learning impairment on a single oral dose given to rats which have been exposed to cholinergic neurotoxins. Subsequent studies have shown that it may induce long-lasting procognitive effects in cholinergic neurotoxin-treated rats by changing the choline transporter regulation system.

## Legality

### Australia

Coluracetam is a schedule 4 substance in Australia under the Poisons Standard (February 2020). A  schedule 4 substance is classified as "Prescription Only Medicine, or Prescription Animal Remedy – Substances, the use or supply of which should be by or on the order of persons permitted by State or Territory legislation to prescribe and should be available from a pharmacist on prescription."
