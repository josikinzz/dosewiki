I tried some which was independently confirmed by NMR to be 6-APDB. It seemed remarkably psychedelic and quite pleasant, but did make me surprisingly hot considering the subtle effects. This was at about 40mg insufflated, accounting for some which got blown out when I sneezed!


I would therefore expect higher potency than 6-APB, perhaps less stimulation and more psychedelia.

Not at that dose but I would be shocked if it didn't display a comedown similar to MDMA, 6-APB etc

^ This - and it does. Some people get it immediately, and then some get none until after a few uses. (much like MDMA, MDA, or the APB's)


also, from what I've heard APDB is more potent - but no different in effects (aside from slight onset time changes) than 6-APB.

well i have asked for the comedown because that's how 6-ABP is positively different from MDMA and MDA for *ME*.


i love 6-ABP compared to MDMA because of:

* added psychedelia

* no crash, easier comedown, no midweek blues


MDA has the psychedelia MDMA is missing but the side-effect are even worse.


but i always dose 6-ABP lower than most people here (judging from the B&D thread) - 120mg is my maximum and i've never felt the need to go higher. 

also i don't need the fake loved-up-ness of MDMA because i have enough love anyway (thank you LSD, mescaline, shrooms, meditation, yoga, pretty women!)


so if 6-ADBP has even more psychedlia and the comedown is as "easy" as 6-ABP it could be a winner for me.

just the hyperthermia is worrying me a bit (thinking of the trouble with 5-API).


anyway, i'll receive my sample soon, will start low (of course!) and report back.

I did 25mg with 10mg 5-MeO-MiPT recently and had a lovely time. It's worth a try IMHO, though I don't know how much value it would have on its own.

Is it that potent, are you that sensitive, or was the synergy that good?

The main course for the evening was always intended to be 5-MeO-MIPT (10mg is a strong dose), with APDB simply there to enhance, particularly the social aspects. Unfortunately it seems I had some tolerance to the psychedelia from a somewhat spur-of-the-moment LSD trip 3 days prior, but the serotonergic effects did feel subtly noticeable. 


Unfortunately the combination makes the report of little use for characterising 6-APDB in any meaningful way but it does at least appear that this is a pleasant combination without obvious unpleasant interactions.

Ok, I have some of this stuff. Marquis reagent is a pale reddish-purple, and Mecke is a very dark purplish-black, which is pretty much identical to what I would get with 6-APB. This particular batch I have lacks the industrial-strength cleaner smell I've gotten with some past batches of 6-APB, so hey, that's a plus. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


I took an oral dose of 75mg about 5 hours ago, along with 400mg of chelated magnesium in case of jaw gurning. Waited a half hour, then ate a small lunch, knowing I probably won't be hungry for the rest of the day. About a half hour after that, I started to feel it coming on, with waves of hot flashes alternating with nausea. This was pretty unpleasant...I can deal with nausea on its own, but combined with hot flashes I start to freak out, because it reminds me of the one and only time I took mCPP I got really bad hot flashes on the come up and that developed into a full-blown panic attack where I was convinced I had truly poisoned myself. Anyways, this time I took half a unisom to cope, and that made me a little tired but at least it diminished the nausea a bit and staved off the edges of panic I could feel creeping in.


It was another couple of hours before the hot flashes subsided and I relaxed into a fairly decent contented stimulation with mild OEVs and occasional nystagmus. Not getting a whole lot of euphoria though, and I'm not really sure it was worth the rough comeup. At this level I'd say it was about equivalent to 100mg of 6-APB - I would normally do 125-135mg of 6-APB, and I've gone up as high as 145mg. I haven't taken any in almost a year though, or any other in the MDxx family, so I shouldn't have any tolerance built up. I think if I try this again I will split the dose in two and take them an hour apart. I also think I'm getting too old for this stuff anymore (I'm turning 35 in a few months) and maybe it's time to give all of those serotonin receptors in the gut a rest, they've certainly taken a beating over the years. Maybe rectal admin would help with that if I do this again, I don't know. Anyways, that's my report!


Edited to add: It's the next day, and I feel pretty horrible. I barely slept, and had a few bouts of diarrhea during the night and early this morning. I feel dehydrated and overheated and I'm getting brain zaps too. I forgot to mention before that I had taken some 3-MeO-PCP the night before doing the 6-APDB, and I'm starting to wonder if there's a bad interaction between the two and that's what's been making me feel sick. I did some googling today and apparently it's a bad idea to mix methoxetamine with MDxx or 6-APB, so it's possible that 3-MeO-PCP also shouldn't be mixed with serotonin releasers (even if you take them 18 hours apart like I did). It's also possible that 6-APDB is a lot more potent than 6-APB and I just took too large of a dose. Anyways, it's going to be a long time (if ever) before I put this stuff in body again so maybe some other brave psychonaut can figure these things out.

Strange, I have found no real hyperthermia with this.  The slight chills and odd heat but just like MDMA really.  Nothing too noticeable anyway.  Maybe insufflating it does this?

Tested 6-APBD orally at an event for first time to see if it works in a "suitable" setting; it was very successful. Started off with 50mg on an empty stomach (hadn't eaten in 6 hours) and after waiting one hour, some mild effects were felt but not a satisfactory level for "rolling", so another 50mg was taken orally. After waiting another hour for the effects to peak, the total 100mg was very successful. Having tried MDA, MDMA, 6-APB, and 5-APB at various milligram dosages, I had difficultly differentiating the 100mg 6-APDB from ~90mg MDA. 6-APDB had similar qualities such as ease of flowing to music, ease of conversation, disinhibition of social boundaries, jaw clenching, tactile sensations, sexual/loving desires, and increased energy. 6-APDB effects were akin to a mix between 6-APB and MDA but with much milder visual hallucinations/distortions and more focus on the mental energy. Overall, the test was successful and gives it a thumbs up.

^ Nice wee summary there man.  Do you think it feels cleaner than 6-apb?  With a nicer empathogenic headspace?  Also definitely more stimulating for me.  Agree on the 50mg it's definitely not full on.  Wish I'd gone higher but next time.  Think 100mg will be a good shout.  Can't wait to try this at a club sometime.  Really think it could be a winner on that front.

6-APDB feels clean and is nicely empathogenic, but I personally prefer 6-APB because 6-APB is more psychedelic since I prefer psychedelics to rolls for "empathetic" feelings. 6-APDB felt less stimulating than 6-APB; 100mg 6-APB would have my heart beating around 135-155 (which is high) while the 100mg of 6-APDB was less heart stimulating at an equal dose (around 120-135bpm). It really is a winner as far as a empathogenic amphetamine goes.

Ohhhh gotcha, I somehow managed to think you were referring to the days after, not the immediate comedown.

That's interesting how you find 6-apb more psychedelic.  Haven't really got much from it on that front apart from the tail end with a few shimmers here and there.  Always found that it very heavy on the head though.  Even at a lower dose I felt that 6-apdb was more psychedelic.  No visuals really apart from the brightness but my head had that familiar feel.  Kind of similar to a small mushroom dose.  Clearer and less fuzzy.  I agree that it feels less stimulating on the body but more energy to it in a subtle way.  It's there but you don't really realise it.  With 6-apb I get really monged out and lazy but was up and chatty last night.  Maybe even more so than MDMA.  Would easily be up and dancing.  Unlike 6-apb, I feel this is not one for solo adventures.  Would have loved to have people around.  I had no trouble sleeping either which, again, is similar to MDMA for me.  Early days but I'd like to agree with your last sentence.

Another attempt at 6-APDB was made today at a 100mg single dose with a friend who took the same amount (and who also has never rolled [he/she has only ever taken amphetamine/adderall, so that friend's perspective was a great help). Setting was a dubstep event/club. It's been a week since the last dose and no amphetamines were taken between that week. Again, similar effects were felt for myself and I danced for two hours straight but I think the friend's report on the experience is more important. The friend was getting:

-Nystagmus (eye shaking)

-Jaw clenching

-Visual trailers/tracers

-Color brightening/color contrast increase

-The friend claimed to have physical orgasms 8 times during the event

-Chattiness

-Mental and physical euphoria (after asking the friend whether we should leave, the friend said "I feel great! I could dance all night even though I know you guys can't")

-Tactile sensations where the friend said "I feel your touch after you touch me" which I deduced as the goosebumps that follow immediately after touching one's skin, as well as becoming extremely overwhelmed with happiness when massaged or rubbing cloth across his/her face)

-Sexual excitability


We both had a fun time and the friend said that he/she definitely would do it again. 

As far as 6-APB goes for me, I act "differently", so 100mg MDMA tend to calm or slow me down while 100mg 6-APB has me in an intensely euphoric psychedelic roll for ~12 hours. I like 6-APB better than MDMA so that may be where my bias comes in; 2C-X's are more euphoric to me than MDxx/MDx's, hence another bias towards psychedelics.

From highest favoured "roll" to lowest: 6-APB>6-APDB=MDA>MDMA>5-APB (amphetamine is my favourite "roll" because of the entactogenic/empathogenic feelings I get at higher doses, but it's not commonly considered a roll). For the second time trying 6-APDB, I rank it pretty highly for an entactogen/emphathogen.

MMPA, you seem to have a preference for the more dopaminergic substances, and I believe that they are dopaminergic in decreasing order of intensity in the exact same sequence: amphetamine > 6-APB>6-APDB=MDA>MDMA>5-APB


I find it very interesting however that you prefer the 2C's euphoria over the MDxx, considering that 2C's only slightly affect monoamine levels

I dosed at 2000, redosed at 2130 and was able to sleep pretty well at 0300 after dancing quite a bit. I'm usually fairly sensitive to sleep disturbance so it seems it could be a bit shorter.

It seems like this stuff has very varying effects on people indeed.  I also find it psychedelic.  Not too much in terms of visuals but in the mind for me.  How would you describe it, Transfom?  Definitely more than MDMA anyway, like yourself.  But I found it very sociable, crying out for some company but present circumstances meant that I was alone chatting online for company.  Lots of empathy.  Stimulating also and have mentioned it many times that I can't wait to give this a shot in a club.  Not overly euphoric though, a nice warm lasting body feeling.  How did music enhancement go in the club?  Before the Ket.  Yet, we are similar with the sleeping part.  Easy enough and a consistent one.

I didn't really feel much of it to be honest. I expect there was some music enhancement but it's not clear what was me getting myself amped up vs. what the drug was doing. There's no doubt that what little I did get was more psychedelic.


Perhaps it will be a little like MDMA in that lower doses are almost sedating and just a bit love-y while larger doses give an insatiable urge to connect with people and lots of energy.

A Mecke, Marquis, Simon A and Simon B reagent test was done on 6-APDB.


After all the tests were done, the marquis and mecke produces positive results for presence of MDxx and after doing the simon reagent, the closest result on the chart for Mecke/Marquis/Simon was to MDA (except instead of the Simon reagent turning slightly blue upon reaction, the reagent changed to a vaguely tinted slight pink). The fact that 6-APDB reacts similarly to MDA is evidence to it's similarity in how it metabolizes in the body. 


Therefore, it's likely that the closest "feel" of 6-APDB to another common rolling compound is MDA.

Reagent tests are great but they are not intended to simulate human metabolism and so you definitely cannot draw the conclusion you have from those results.

I did some googling today and apparently it's a bad idea to mix methoxetamine with MDxx or 6-APB, so it's possible that 3-MeO-PCP also shouldn't be mixed with serotonin releasers (even if you take them 18 hours apart like I did). It's also possible that 6-APDB is a lot more potent than 6-APB and I just took too large of a dose. Anyways, it's going to be a long time (if ever) before I put this stuff in body again so maybe some other brave psychonaut can figure these things out.

I'm currently about 4 hours into ~30 mg plugged (19:00ish) on the tail end of roughly 10 mg 3-MeO-PCP around midday. I've not tried 6-APDB before now and was planning to wait till next weekend to try it out as I'd had a few cheeky vapes of AMT earlier in the week. Not a huge fan of AMT personally but I've had this stuff lying around for absolutely ages and I was just a bit too bored one evening and had nout else in at the time but 2-FMA, 2-AI, poppy pods and weed... 2-FMA and 2-AI I only use for productive purposes, poppy pods have lingering noddy effects which affect my performance at work and weed is boring unless coming down from psyches or entactogens.


Anyway, the 3-MeO-PCP put me in the a pleasant but somewhat dis-inhibited mood and I couldn't quite help myself. I'm having a fantastic time though. The initial headspace is more MDMA like than with 6-APB. Definitely more empathy. The come-up is faster too, but like the APB's, doesn't have much of a "rush". 


It's has plateau'd into a more 6-APB like psychedelic headspace, but as others have mentioned, there's no real visuals. The colour enhancement is fantastic though, probably better than with 6-APB which I do find somewhat visual. 


As for stimulation, I can't quite tell which is more stimulating, 6-APB, or APDB... the stimulation is different, but I can't quite explain it. 6-APB feels stimulating a slightly more 2C kinda way, and 6-APDB in more of an MDMA/amphetamine kind of way yet not rushy.


These difficult to explain differences make it tricky to say which is more euphoric or enjoyable. I'd say 6-APB probably has more straight up euphoria, but with this I keep finding myself getting waves of euphoria from simple things, like cuddling the cat and tasting good food. I have no appetite but eating was still enjoyable. I find eating on 6-APB a chore, with no enhancement of taste that I can tell, or even care about.


As for the possible dangers of using an SRA some time after 3-MeO-PCP, there's probably little to worry about unless you're doing large doses or other things that go against basic common sense. Methoxetamine has been shown to be an effective SRI, with an affinity for the serotonin transporter (Ki=481nM) not much lower than for the NMDA receptor (Ki=259nM). 3-MeO-PCP has a stronger affinity for SERT (Ki=216nM) But MUCH stronger affinity for NMDAR (Ki=20nM). Obviously you should still excercise caution. I'm definitely not going to be re dosing at all. 


If I had to choose between 6-APB or APDB, then I think for just chilling at home like I am leaning slightly towards 6-APB. This feels more social... it's bought me out of my BL cave for a start! I rarely visit any more, never mind post. Conclusion: It's early days yet and my dose was quite low. More trials are needed to give an accurate opinion.

**Intramuscular IM 6-APDB**


With 50 mg IM, 30 minutes after a 5 mg IM test dose:


I felt the onset within 8 minutes, and was plateaued within 20. This is the only ROA I've tried with my small sample of this compound. I'd describe the intensity of effects at "plus two" for an empathogen similar to MDMA. I have little tolerance to serotonin releasers, I did, however, use 5-MeO-aMT about a week ago, though that experience was also only at a plus two dose (and it's serotonin releasing capacities seem markedly less than 6-APDB or 5 or 6-APB.

I love 6-APDB, it almost always leaves with a resounding sense of peace i've really only felt from mescaline. The amount of empathy it provides is fairly unreal as well. Not to mention its BL is truly comfortable, sedating at just the right rate making sinking into a comfy recliner for some deep thought far to tempting, though walking is/was thoroughly enjoyable as well! I mainly IM'd it, I simply enjoy the onset much greater than oral and certainly enjoy the reduction of dose as well, for me 50mgs IM was pretty much a full dose though mainly within 30mins i'd usually be caught prepping another 15-45mgs. Very comfortable to accompany other psychedelics in my experience.

I dosed a little too low on 6-APDB (40 mg) this past weekend, never got beyond + and 1/2, and felt extremely sedated and almost motion sick about 6 hours later.  I was surprised as 50 mg 6-APB was absolutely flooring.  My partner reported the same disappointment at 100 mg.


We had both been sick with a cold/fever taking Robitussin (DXM) and Flonase for a couple days.

I suppose you lost because you bought 6-apb and got something else. You may have also won if you prefer 6-apdb but it's a less reliable substance (see Pagey) than the 6-APB.

^It's expensive for the kind of testing that can tell 6-APDB from 6-APB unless you're a citizen of some place like the Netherlands where the government doesn't deem deriving happiness from chemical means rather than established religions or economy-boosting material wealth acquisition deserving of death by mistaken drug identification. If you were born lucky there's subsidized testing programs.

IME:  6APB: lots of euphoria, residual stimulation on the comedown, sleeping impossible without a benzo, erection impossible.

        6APDB: mild euphoria, immense uncomfortable tiredness 5-6 hours after dosing, sleep like a rock as soon as i give in, rock hard erection. 


I much preferred 6-APB, although i won't use any serotonin releasing drugs anymore cos' they alwy smess up my mood the following week

IME the APBs have a much worse emotional crash than MDMA ever has.  


My APB to APDB comparison was identical to yours (though cannot comment on boners).  I'm glad it wasn't just me; the immense uncomfortable tiredness was totally unexpected based on other trip reports I've seen. The need to lie down was almost like nausea a few hours into APDB.  I didn't sleep right away but I lied there having uncomfortable CEVs for an hour or two then fell right asleep.  


Has this happened to others as well?

I've not noticed any notable exhaustion after using 6-APDB, and I've used it IM a couple times (which I'd expect to make any crash more acute). I've never experienced a noticeably bad come down or latter day effects from it or 5/6-APB. I have had a crash from MDMA, but it was only ever really bad the very first time I used it (it was my first time using any serotonin releaser). I should note I've only ever used these triple monoamine releasing empathogens in moderation. I'm sure the bad aftereffects only increase if you use them more then once every one or two months.

I did a lot of mdma 10-12 yrs ago, but been really conservative with triple releasers since, 0-6 times per year, usually towards the lower end of that range. I tend not to notice too much of an extended hangover, but a little low mood for a couple days. Moderation is key. Looking forward to trying this & 5-MAPB sometime over the next few months.

I haven't noticed any particular crash from 6-APDB. That said, I don't notice much crash from MDMA or MDA either. I do feel physically exhausted after the effects wear off between 5-8 hours after a 6-APDB dose. In combination with 2C-E (both drugs taken together at 0:00; 80 mg 6-APDB & 15 mg 2C-E), I only noticed the drop-off of 6-APDB effects as a drop-off in physical energy and gregariousness whereas a coolly rational mind was still running strong.

6-APDB is in general more psychedelic, and more potent than 6-APB. For me, 6-APDB is also more more stoning than 6-APB, though others become quite energized by it. 6-APDB also has a shorter peak than 6-APB. Oral ROA emphasizes the psychedelic effects, insufflation emphasizes "rolling" effects. An oral dose of 150mg of 6-APDB HCl is at least as strong as 180mg of 6-APB succinate.


6-APDB HCl Dosage:

Threshold: ???

Mild: 80-100mg

Common 100-120mg

Strong: 120-180mg


In regards to combining 6-APDB and dissociatives, I have seen 6-APDB (160mg, insufflated over ~2 hours) combined with MXE (unknown dosage, IV). It looked quite messy, but nobody died.

I've now tried the compound about 5 times. 80 mg has been active but not overwhelming or incapacitating for the handful of other people I've had the chance to speak with about the substance. For a couple, the effects have been barely threshold and have benefited from a 40 mg booster dose around the 1 hour point with no subsequent boosters.

So it looks like I finally have an opportunity to take this one out for a little spin tonight :D It's gonna mark my first run-in with a RC SRA so I'm fairly excited to see if it will manage to live up to the collective benzofuran hype or not. Was considering starting off with 95mg and *maybe* (still debating this) 10mg or so of 2-FMA to give it an extra kick as I don't want to be monged out at the party I'm going to. Sound reasonable?

personally 100mg was too much at 60kg, but it didnt kick in at all until some serious pumping music came on about 2.5h, possibly more, after dosing. The fma might boot start it, but you won't get a real feel for the 6-apdb with it. It's up to you, but I'd solo it at maybe 90mg and make sure the party is playing my playlist

It's funny how music activates its effects and only once YOUR music comes on - I observed something similar at a sort of lame music festival.  


This might then be great for solo listening journeys at home.

Has anyone ever mixed 4-FA and 6-APDB? I was thinking like 100mg 4-FA : 25mg 6-APDB and take a few doses over the night? Any reasons this is a bad mix? Seems like potential better than ecstacy hit,bound to be more rushy and trippy surely?

That's a LOT of 4fma to be ingesting in an evening--it's quite a long-acting compound.

4-FA ≠ 4-FMA ebola ![:p](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)


Its not unusual to go through 100mg of 4-FA in a night. Its not unusual to see much more than that in a night.


I can't see why you would want to mix it with 6-APDB though.


And Dr_Robotnik, you don't have to post your question all over the boards. 


In any case, this combo will likely have a nasty crash and I wouldn't recommend it. From the sound of it, you're asking about an ecstasy alternative and I don't know what your motives are but this doesn't sound like a good idea. The APB family are all rather poor substitutes for MDMA, some of them potentially dangerous in overdose, and all of them have wicked crashes associated with them.

That was actually a typo, and I meant to put "4fa".  with 4fa, ~120 mg is a good attack dose for a medium-strong experience, and then duration is out to 8 hrs. plus.  Taking 100 mg / 4fa at a rate of "a few doses over the night" (mounting I assumed to 3-400 mg) would constitute quite a strong dose.

I assumed it was the 6 he would be redosing, and the 4fa was just a 'base dose'


I think a [couple](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/683166-EADD-New-(or-relatively-new)-RCs-Tweakier-and-more-moreish?p=11865468&viewfull=1#post11865468) of people from EADD have tried, and fell in love with the combo. Like the others have said: harsh harsh comedown.

I assumed that 100mg 4-FA : 25mg 6-APDB was a ratio implying that he'd keep redosing.


The way you're talking about it makes more sense to me but who knows. He made like 5 posts across the forums about it so it must have been a very pressing issue ![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif)

My 6-APB turned winey brown to black with Marquis. Had testkit confiscated at a US/CA border so I can't say I've tested 6-APDB.


If combining 4-FA with 6-APDB I would be more inclined to do 70-80mg 6-APDB and 30-40 mg 4-FA.  


I gave about 95 mg 6-APDB to a friend (who is probably 70 kg) the other night and he was pretty monged out, setting was not good (acoustic guitar concert) but he says he had fun.


I'm really in no rush to use this one again but when I do I will combine with 4-FA.

I know that the Marquis and Mecke of 6-APB (or, well, an unknown APB, since it was only verified by GC/MS... I think you need NMR to tell the difference between 5 and 6) should be dark purple/black. Very much like MDA.


The difference between APB and APDB is pretty small; I would think the test results would be quite similar instinctively. I don't see a GC/MS verified APDB, or a field test listing for APDB in the forensic sites, yet, though (My guess is MS should tell the difference between APB and APDB...)

With 100 mg taken at t+6 into a 13 mg 2C-E trip, I noticed a more balanced mood a smile plastered across my face for the duration of the experience which ended around t+13 with sleep. The come-up was rough with nausea and a sense of being overwhelmed by lights. Once that passed, I was in and out of a hot tub so somatic effects were not pronounced beyond the hot tub being amazing. A hot tub is amazing even stone sober so I think that may have overridden the effects. I didn't spend a lot of time dancing nor did I notice any particular hyperthermia.


Revisiting this at 100 mg with more than a month since last testing, I am only more confused. I had limited body load during the come-up: one trip to the bathroom for a poo at t+0:30 and I was good to go. No hyperthermia. While sitting on the throne I wondered if I had nystagmus but it turned out to just be an irritatingly broken fluorescent ballast. On the one hand, clearly some mind-expanding activity was present wherein elements of the mundane were rendered novel, such as a sunset and ocean waves. On the other hand, I found myself dancing to my headphones while waiting for a bus though I did not experience the "electric skin" sensation I have found in the early come-up of MDMA. There was no remarkable visual distortion as I experience with 4-xO tryptamines. I was socially quieter as I've been with 2Cs, though this may have been a result of a stimulant suppressing my unmedicated ADD. I was smiling more, laughing easier, and dancing down the sidewalk as I've experienced with MDMA. I was clearly euphoric but I was also in control of myself - I could stop myself from excitedly yammering because the point had been made (to my companion, who had taken LSD much earlier). At t+5:00 cigarette helped me relax and enjoy the effects but that's true of damn near everything I try. My heart rate was elevated for the duration of the experience. Next time I'll have someone measure my blood pressure.


I just don't get it. Is it like a cross between MDA and MDAI? Between MDMA and MDA? MDMA and MDAI? About all I can really say at this point is that I've experienced activity between 80 and 100 mg and that it seems to last until around 8-9 hours.

^Some people simply seem to not receive strong effects from this one at lower doses, luckily for me I get blasted by as little as 50mgs. Will be revisiting this one soon with 2c-e as well, last time was spectacularly marvelous!

My bad for bumping this, but I have been in two minds about ordering some 6-APDB as a nice change to MDMA. I have MD available, but I thought about trying something a bit different. 


I have had an explore through the EADD thread, but would someone mind explaining to me how they found APDB for rushy/euphoria/fuckedness, and if it combo's well with anything (5APB etc). My plan in about 3 months, was to drop around 150mg of 6-APDB and enjoy my voyage....thoughts?

Hi, I've read this entire thread and this is what I got from it:


- the doses are a bit lower than 6-apb

- it's a bit more trippy

- it's not as stimulating


Is this basically correct?


Does it combine well with something else (like 6-apb with 5-apb)?

How does it go with psys?


Thanks

I will let you know how it goes with something like 6-apb or mdma after this weekend, I imagine if you know certain things work well with MD(M)A they'll probably work very well with this but a bit trippier. Personally can't see it working too well with K, but some people enjoy K & MD so who knows.


I find it just as stimulating anyway tbh, maybe an insignificant teeny weeny little bit less, I also found that my memories of the night weren't so clear but I was up for 40 hours total the most recent time I did it, so everything was a bit cloudy

Ah... My plants love this chemical, they tell me it makes them feel like a magical dancing euphoric plant. I tell the, "Yes it is indeed, it is quite possibly perfection as to analogues of MDA goes. It 's effects are amazing, music appreciation is trough the rough, and talking to friends flows like a rive of gibberish and jokes... and then taking pictures and videos, well never fails to be fun."


What? You want more tonight.... well sure, lets do 125mg. :D Oh yeah, you guys are gonna feel groovy tonight babay! ![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif)

I find that the 6-APDB can be kinda "lazy", thus I give my plants "boosters" of Pentedrone, and they say it works wonderfully. Pent. is nice because of its not too speedy quality and euphoria it brings, its buzzes the apdb and says "Lets go! w00t!" and good tiems ensue. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)
