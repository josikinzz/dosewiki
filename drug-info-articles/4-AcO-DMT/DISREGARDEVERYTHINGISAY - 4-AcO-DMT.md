4-AcO-DMT (also known as Psilacetin, 4-Acetoxy-DMT, or O-Acetylpsilocin) is a synthetically produced psychoactive drug usually sold by online research chemical vendors. It is the acetylated form of the psilocybin mushroom alkaloid psilocin and is a lower homologue of 4-AcO-DET, 4-AcO-MiPT and 4-AcO-DiPT.

This substance is considered by the psychedelic community to be an extremely useful alternative to psilocybin as they are both believed to be pro-drugs of psilocin. This is because many people report that the subjective effects are indistinguishable from that of a typical psilocybin mushroom trip.

However, many people also report that 4-AcO-DMT’s effects differ greatly from that of psilocybin and psilocin. The exact differences are often difficult to define but suggest that as well as being a pro-drug to psilocin, 4-AcO-DMT is also active in itself.

The 4-AcO-DMT experience contains a complex and wide array of effects which based on the predefined potential subjective effects index found [here](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effects_index), I will now begin to breakdown and describe.

**Physical Effects:**

The physical effects of 4-AcO-DMT can be broken down into two components all of which progressively intensify proportional to dosage. These are described below and generally include:

- **Spontaneous tactile sensations** - The body high of 4-AcO-DMT can be described as a pleasurable, warm, soft and all-encompassing tingling sensation. This maintains a consistent presence that steadily rises with the onset and hits its limit once the peak has been reached.
- **Sedation** - In terms of its effects on the physical energy levels of the tripper, 4-AcO-DMT is considered by most to be relaxing, stoning and mildly sedating. This sense of sedation is often accompanied by compulsive yawning, a runny nose and watering eyes.

**Cognitive Effects:**

The head space of 4-AcO-DMT is described by many as extremely relaxing, profound and stoning in its style when compared to other commonly used psychedelics such as LSD or 2C-B which tend to be energetic and stimulating. It contains a large number of psychedelic typical and unique cognitive effects.

The most prominent of these typical effects generally include:

- **Enhancement of current mind state**
- **Connectivity of thought**
- **Feelings of fascination, importance and awe**
- **Time distortion**
- **Outrospection 
**
- **Deja-Vu**
- **Removal of cultural filter**
- **Feelings of predeterminism**
- **Conceptual thinking**
- **Direct communication with the subconsious**
- **Ego suppression, loss and death**
- **Feelings of interdependent opposites**
- **Delusions**
- **States of unity and interconnectedness**
- **Enhancement and suppression cycles - **This can be described as constant waves of extremely stimulated and profound thinking which are spontaneously surpassed in a cyclic fashion by waves of general thought suppression and mental intoxication. These two states seem to switch between each other in a consistent loop once every 20 - 60 minutes.

**Visual Effects:**

*Enhancements*

4-AcO-DMT presents a full and complete array of possible visual enhancements which generally include:

- **Increased visual acuity**
- **Enhancement of colours**
- **Enhanced pattern recognition**

*Distortions*

As for visual distortions and alterations, effects experienced are detailed below:

- **Visual drifting** (*melting, flowing, breathing and morphing*) - In comparison to other psychedelics, this effect can be described as highly detailed, slow and smooth in motion and static in its appearance.
- **Tracers**
- **After images**
- **Texture repetition**
- **Colour shifting**
- **Scenery slicing**

*Geometry*

The visual geometry that is present throughout this trip can be described as more similar in appearance to that of 4-AcO-DMT, Ayahuasca and 2C-E than LSD. It can be comprehensively described as structured in its organization, organic in geometric style, intricate in complexity, large in size, fast and smooth in motion, colourful in scheme, glossy in colour, blurred in its edges and rounded in its corners. They have a very “natural” feel to them and at higher dosages are significantly more likely to result in states of Level 7B visual geometry over Level 7A.

*Hallucinatory States*

4-AcO-DMT and its various other forms produce a full range of high level hallucinatory states in a fashion that is more consistent and reproducible than that of many other commonly used psychedelics. These effects generally include:

- **External hallucinations**
- **Internal hallucinations** - This particular effect commonly contains hallucinations with scenarios, landscapes, settings, concepts and autonomous entity contact. They are more common within dark environments and can be described as internal in their manifestation, lucid in believability, interactive in style and almost exclusively of religious, spiritual, mystical or a transcendental nature in their overall theme.

**Auditory Effects:**

The auditory effects of 4-AcO-DMT are common in their occurrence and exhibit a full range of effects which commonly include:

- **Enhancements**
- **Distortions**
- **Hallucinations**

**Physical Health Effects, Potential Addiction and Tolerance:**

The lethal dosage at which 50% of users would suffer a fatal overdose (LD50) of psilacetin has been extrapolated from animal results to be roughly 800mg for an average human being. This is 10 times the extremely high dosage of 80mg which most users would never feel the need to take.

In terms of its tolerance, 4-AcO-DMT tolerance lasts for approximately a week, meaning that it is very difficult to form an addiction to this substance. It also has a high cross-tolerance, affecting the potency of other tryptamines. Alongside of this (due to its psychedelic properties) users report a strong self-regulating quality towards the usage of this substance.

As a member of the tryptamine family, 4-AcO-DMT can be considered harmless and benign when it comes to any negative physical repercussions towards one’s health. This is supported by the total lack of any negative health reports, but of course cannot be guaranteed due to lack of formal scientific studies.

**Legal issues:**

Possession and sale of 4-AcO-DMT is unscheduled in most countries.

- **UK:** It could be considered illegal under the 1971 Misuse of Drugs Act as it metabolizes into psilocin.
- **USA:** It could be considered illegal under the Federal Analog Act as an analogue of psilocin.

**Conclusion:**

As far as I am aware, 4-AcO-DMT is by far the experientially deepest and most spiritual research chemical tryptamine that is currently available within the online market. It is in many ways considerably more practical than psilocybin mushrooms and from my personal experience indistinguishable in its effects and considerably easier to ingest with reduced nausea.
