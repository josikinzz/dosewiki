## Interactions

### ⛔ Dangerous
- **amt**
- **lithium**: There are a large number of reports indicating a high seizure and psychosis risk from this combination.

### ⚠️ Unsafe
- **tramadol**: This combination can cause seizures due to the lowering of the threshold by tramadol and the potential of mescaline to cause seziures.

### ⚡ Caution
- **2c-t-x**
- **2c-x**
- **5-meo-xxt**: The 5-MeO class of tryptamines can be unpredictable in their interactions
- **amphetamines**: The focus and anxiety caused by stimulants is magnified by psychedelics and results in an increased risk of thought loops
- **cannabis**: Cannabis has an unexpectedly strong and somewhat unpredictable synergy with psychedelics.
- **cocaine**: The focus and anxiety caused by stimulants is magnified by psychedelics and results in an increased risk of thought loops
- **diphenhydramine**: At 25-50mg, DPH may assist with side effects of the mescaline such as nausea and anxiety. At higher dosages, the combination of a deliriant (DPH) and mescaline is cautioned against. Mescaline is likely to increase the deliriant and negative effects of DPH, in addition to increasing the risk of severe injury and mental trauma.

- **nbomes**
- **pregabalin**: Caution should be given due to mescaline’s stimulating effects and pregabalin’s seizure concerns at higher dosages. Pregabalin may reduce the vasoconstriction, anxiety, and other side effects of mescaline. Additionally, Pregabalin may increase mescaline’s inhibition and risk of injury.
