**4-AcO-DET** ( **4-Acetoxy-N,N-diethyltryptamine** , **ethacetin** ) is a lesser-known novel [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) substance of the [tryptamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tryptamine) class. It is chemically related to [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) and part of a series of substituted tryptamines that includes 4-AcO-MET and 4-AcO-DMT.

Today it is either used recreationally as a [designer drug](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Designer_drug) or as an [entheogenic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entheogen) compound and is typically acquired through the use of online [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) vendors.

There is very little data on the human pharmacology or toxicity of 4-AcO-DET, although analytical methods have been developed for its detection. It remains relatively rare and has very little documented history of human usage. It is highly advised to use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Harm_reduction_practices) if using this substance.

## Chemistry

4-AcO-DET, or 4-Acetoxy-N.N-diethyltryptamine, is a synthetic indole alkaloid molecule of the [tryptamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tryptamine) class. Tryptamines share a core structure comprised of a bicylic indole heterocycle attached at R 3 to an amino group via an ethyl side chain. 4-AcO-DET is substituted at R 4 of its indole heterocycle with an acetoxy (AcO) functional group CH 3 COO−. It also contains two ethyl chains bound to the terminal amine R N of its tryptamine backbone ( [DET](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DET) ).

4-AcO-DET is the N-substituted diethyl homolog of [4-HO-DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-HO-DMT) (psilocin). 4-AcO-DET is the acetate ester analog of [DET](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DET) and the N-substituted diethyl analog of [4-AcO-DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-AcO-DMT) . It is a higher homolog of [4-AcO-DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-AcO-DMT) and [4-AcO-MET](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-AcO-MET) .

## Pharmacology

4-substituted acetylated tryptamines such as 4-AcO-DET, [4-AcO-MET](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-AcO-MET) , and [4-AcO-DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-AcO-DMT) are hypothesized to principally act as a [prodrug](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Prodrug) for their respective hydrolyzed counterparts (e.g. [4-HO-DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-HO-DMT) , [4-HO-MET](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-HO-MET) and [4-HO-DET](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-HO-DET) ). In theory, they would become inactive until they are deacetylated in the body, although there is on-going discussion as to whether they might display their own intrinsic activity. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

Like with most [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) tryptamines, 4-AcO-DET is thought to act principally as a [5-HT2A](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin#The_5-HT_system) [partial agonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist#Agonists) . The psychedelic effects are believed to come from 4-AcO-DET's binding efficacy at the 5-HT 2A receptors.

However, the role of these interactions and how they result in the psychedelic experience continues to remain elusive.

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation)** and **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)** - In terms of its effects on the physical energy levels of the user, 4-AcO-DET is typically relaxing, stoning and mildly sedating, although it can also sometimes be very stimulating and give users a "wired" feeling. This sense of sedation is often accompanied by uncontrollable yawning.
- **[Spontaneous physical sensations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_physical_sensations)** - The "body high" of 4-AcO-DET can be described as a pleasurable, warm, soft and all-encompassing tingling sensation. This maintains a consistent presence that steadily rises with the onset and hits its limit once the peak has been reached. Unlike other 4-substituted tryptamines, 4-AcO-DET is capable of being more stimulating and [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) -inducing.

- **[Diffraction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Diffraction)**
 
#### Geometry
 
The visual geometry that is present throughout this trip can be described as more similar in appearance to that of [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) , [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) or [2C-E](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-E) than that of [4-AcO-DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-AcO-DMT) and [ayahuasca](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ayahuasca) . It can be comprehensively described through its [variations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Geometry#Variations) as intricate in complexity, abstract in form, synthetic in style, structured in organization, brightly lit and multicoloured in scheme, glossy in shading, soft in edges, large in size, slow in speed, smooth in motion, rounded in corners, non-immersive in depth and consistent in intensity. The visuals have a very "artificial" feel to them and at higher dosages are significantly more likely to result in states of [level 8A](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/8A_Geometry) visual geometry over [level 8B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/8B_Geometry) .
 
#### Hallucinatory states
 
4-AcO-DET and its various other forms can produce a full range of high level hallucinatory states in a fashion that is more consistent and reproducible than that of many other commonly used [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) . These effects generally include:
 
- **[Transformations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Transformations)**
- **[Internal hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucination)** ( *[autonomous entities](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Autonomous_entities)* ; *[settings, sceneries, and landscapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Settings,_sceneries,_and_landscapes)* ; *[perspective hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perspective_hallucinations)* and *[scenarios and plots](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenarios_and_plots)* ) - This effect is very consistent in dark environments at appropriately high dosages. They can be comprehensively described through their [variations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucinations#Variations) as lucid in believability, interactive in style, new experiences in content, autonomous in controllability, [geometry](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Geometry) -based in style and almost exclusively of a personal, religious, spiritual, science-fiction, fantasy, surreal, nonsensical or transcendental nature in their overall theme. ### Cognitive effects
 
- Much like its hydroxylated counterpart 4-HO-DET, the cognitive effects of 4-AcO-DET are described by many as being relatively complex and unpredictable in style when compared to other commonly used [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) such as [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) or [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) which tend to be energetic and stimulating. It contains a notable number of typical and unique psychedelic cognitive effects. The most prominent of these typical effects generally include: 
- **[Analysis enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Analysis_enhancement)**
- **[Conceptual thinking](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Conceptual_thinking)**
- **[Delusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusion)**
- **[Autonomous voice communication](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Autonomous_voice_communication)**
- **[Déjà vu](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/D%C3%A9j%C3%A0_vu)**
- **[Emotion enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Emotion_enhancement)**
- **[Enhancement and suppression cycles](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Enhancement_and_suppression_cycles)** - This can be described as constant waves of extremely stimulated and profound thinking which are spontaneously surpassed in a cyclic fashion by waves of general thought suppression and mental intoxication. These two states seem to switch between each other in a consistent loop once every 20 - 60 minutes.
- **[Feelings of interdependent opposites](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Feelings_of_interdependent_opposites)**
- **[Perception of predeterminism](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perception_of_predeterminism)**
- **[Immersion enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Immersion_enhancement)**

## Toxicity and harm potential

The toxicity and long-term health effects of recreational 4-AcO-DET has not been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dose is unknown. This is because 4-AcO-DET is a [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) with a very limited history of human usage. However, it is assumed to have a similar toxicity profile as [psilocybin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocybin) due to their structural similarity.

Anecdotal reports from those who have tried 4-AcO-DET suggests that there are no negative health effects attributed to simply trying the substance by itself at low to moderate doses and using it very sparingly (but nothing can be completely guaranteed). [Independent research](https://www.google.com/) should always be done to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe before consumption.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this substance.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

Although no formal studies have been conducted, it is believed that 4-AcO-DET is not habit-forming and the desire to use it can actually decrease with use.

Tolerance to the effects of 4-AcO-DET is built almost immediately after ingestion. After that, it takes about 3 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 7 days to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). 4-AcO-DET presents cross-tolerance with all [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) , meaning that after the consumption of 4-AcO-DET all psychedelics will have a reduced effect.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **[Lithium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_(medication))** - Lithium is commonly prescribed for the treatment of [bipolar disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder) . There is a large body of anecdotal evidence that suggests taking it with [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) significantly increases the risk of [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) and [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) . As a result, this combination is strictly discouraged.
- **[Cannabis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cannabis)** - Cannabis may have an unexpectedly strong and unpredictable synergy with the effects of 4-AcO-DET. Caution is advised with this combination as it can significantly increase the risk of adverse psychological reactions like [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) , and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) . Users are advised to start off with only a fraction of their normal cannabis dose and take long breaks between hits to avoid unintentional overdose.
- **[Stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants)** - Stimulants like [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) , [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) or [methylphenidate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylphenidate) affect many parts of the brain and alter [dopaminergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) function. This combination can increase the risk of [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) , and [thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops) . This interaction may also result in an elevated risk of [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) . [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol)** - Tramadol is well-documented to lower the seizure threshold and [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) may act to trigger seizures in susceptible individuals.

*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4-AcO-DET*

4-AcO-DET, also known as 4-acetoxy-N,N-diethyltryptamine as well as ethacetin or ethylacybin, is a psychedelic tryptamine. It was first synthesized in 1958 by Albert Hofmann in the Sandoz lab.

## Use and effects

4-AcO-DET is orally active, and doses of 10 to 25 mg are common. Effects last 4 to 6 hours.  The free base is also active when smoked in a dose range of 5 to 20 mg. Smoking 4-AcO-DET greatly speeds up the onset; peak effects are experienced within 10 minutes, and are usually over within 1 hour.

## Interactions

## Pharmacology

It is expected that 4-AcO-DET is quickly hydrolyzed into the free phenolic 4-HO-DET by serum esterases, but human studies concerning the metabolic fate of this drug are lacking.

## Chemistry

### Analogues

Analogues of 4-AcO-DET include diethyltryptamine (DET), 4-HO-DET (ethocin), ethocybin (4-PO-DET), 4-AcO-DMT (psilacetin), 4-AcO-DPT, 4-AcO-MET, and 4-AcO-MPT, among others.

## Society and culture

### Legal status

#### Sweden

Sveriges riksdags health ministry Statens folkhälsoinstitut classified 4-AcO-DET as "health hazard" under the act Lagen om förbud mot vissa hälsofarliga varor (translated Act on the Prohibition of Certain Goods Dangerous to Health) as of Nov 1, 2005, in their regulation SFS 2005:733 listed as 4-acetoxi-N,N-dietyltryptamin (4-AcO-DET), making it illegal to sell or possess.
