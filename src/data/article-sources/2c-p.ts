2C-P (2,5-dimethoxy-4-propylphenethylamine) is a synthetically produced psychoactive drug usually sold by online research chemical vendors. The substance itself is classed as a psychedelic phenethylamine of the 2C-x family and was first synthesized by Alexander Shulgin in 1974.

Like many 2c-x substances, this drug is a highly dose sensitive psychedelic known for its entactogenic effects, powerful (yet bright) visuals, and intense body load. It is often described by users as a chemical which is very similar to that of 2C-E yet distinct in its own effects. This drug may be overly intense for those who are not already experienced with psychedelics. This is something which is consistently attributed to its often overwhelmingly powerful effects and extremely long duration of 10 - 20 hours.

The 2C-P experience contains a complex and wide array of effects which based on the predefined potential subjective effects index found [here](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effects_index), I will now begin to breakdown and describe.

**Physical effects:**

The physical effects of 2C-P can be broken down into six components all of which progressively intensify proportional to dosage. These are described below and generally include:

- **Spontaneous tactile sensations** - The body high of 2C-P is intense but, in comparison to 2C-E or 2C-B, it can be considered mild though is still capable of becoming very powerful and highly physically euphoric. It is similar yet distinct from the body high experienced on 2C-E, 2C-B, and LSD. The sensation itself can be described as intense and will manifest itself in the form of a continuously shifting tingling sensation that travels up and down the body in spontaneous waves. This is coupled by an equally intense yet slightly uncomfortable energetic pins and needles sensation that constantly encompasses a person’s entire body and a slight warm glow that manifests itself much less consistently than the other two physical components. All of these are capable of becoming very physically euphoric but can be described as proportionally intense with the visual and cognitive effects when compared to LSD.
- **Stimulation** - In terms of its effects on the physical energy levels of the tripper 2C-P is usually considered to be very energetic and stimulating in a fashion that is quite comparable to that of MDMA.
- **Sexual arousal** - A commonly felt physical component of the 2C-P trip is the way in which it heightens and enhances sexual arousal. When experienced, this sensation is not overwhelming or out of control but simply remains something that the tripper is constantly aware of. If sexual activities of any kind are engaged in, they are found to be immensely more pleasurable beyond anything that could be possible sober with orgasm becoming difficult to reach but completely possible to obtain. When obtained, the orgasm itself is capable of temporarily increasing the effects of the drug. This is most commonly experienced as visual effects dramatically increasing in a short yet powerful burst.
- **Increased bodily control**
- **Enhancement of touch**
- **Nausea** - Mild to extreme nausea is consistently reported when consumed in moderate to high dosages and either passes once the tripper has vomited or gradually fades by itself as the peak sets in.
- **Loss of temperature regulation**

**Cognitive effects:**

The head space of 2C-P is described by many as one which is both insightful and relatively normal in its thought processes even at moderate to high dosages.

The total sum of these cognitive components regardless of the setting generally includes:

- **Enhancement of current mind state**
- **Acceleration of thought**
- **Feelings of fascination, importance and awe**
- **Time distortion**
- **Introspection**
- **Outrospection**
- **Removal of cultural filter**
- **Conceptual thinking**
- **Direct communication with the subconsious**
- **Ego suppression, loss and death**
- **Thought loops**
- **Feelings of interdependent opposites**
- **Delusions**
- **States of unity and interconnectedness**

**Visual effects:**

*Enhancements*

2C-P presents a full and complete array of possible visual enhancements which generally include:

- **Increased visual acuity**
- **Enhancement of colours**
- **Enhanced pattern recognition**

*Distortions*

As for visual distortions and alterations, effects experienced are detailed below:

- **Visual drifting** (*melting, flowing, breathing and morphing*) - In comparison to other psychedelics, this effect can be described as highly detailed, slow and smooth in motion, static in appearance, and unrealistic/ cartoon like in style.
- **Tracers**
- **After images**
- **Texture repetition**
- **Colour shifting**
- **Scenery slicing**

*Geometry*

The visual geometry that is present throughout this trip can be described as more similar in appearance to that of 4-AcO-DMT or ayahuasca than that of LSD, 2C-B, or 2C-I. They can be comprehensively described as structured in their organization, organic in geometric style, intricate in complexity, large in size, fast and smooth in motion, colourful in scheme, glossy in colour, sharp in their edges and equally rounded and angular in their corners. They give off a contradictory natural and synthetic feel to them that at higher dosages are significantly more likely to result in states of Level 7B visual geometry over Level 7A. There seems to be visual geometry that is distinct from 2C-E, psilocin and ayahuasca and can be described as faster moving and more intense in proportion to the present cognitive and physical effects than 2C-E.

*Hallucinatory states*

2C-P produces a full range of high level hallucinatory states in a fashion that is more consistent and reproducible than that of many other commonly used psychedelics. This holds particularly true in comparison to other substances within the phenethylamine family. These effects include:

- **External hallucinations**
- **Internal hallucinations** - In comparison to other psychedelics such as LSD, 2C-P is extremely high in hallucinations embedded within visual geometry. This particular effect commonly contains hallucinations with scenarios, settings, concepts and autonomous entity contact. They are more common within dark environments and can be described as internal in their manifestation, lucid in believability, interactive in style and almost exclusively of religious, spiritual, mystical or a transcendental nature in their overall theme.

**Auditory effects:**

The auditory effects of 2C-P are more common in their occurrence than many commonly used psychedelics and exhibit a full range of effects which commonly include:

- **Enhancements**
- **Distortions**
- **Hallucinations**

**Health effects, addiction potential and tolerance:**

The toxicity and long term health effects of recreational 2C-P use does not seem to have been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dosage is unknown. This is because 2C-P is a research chemical with very little history of human usage.

Anecdotal evidence from people who have tried 2C-P within the psychedelic community suggests that there are no negative health effects attributed to simply trying this drug at low to moderate doses or using it very sparingly (but nothing can be completely guaranteed).

2C-P does not seem to be physically addictive and many users experience a self-regulating quality even though there is no real tolerance attributed to this drug (meaning that it could potentially be used multiple days in a row if somebody chose to do so). However, due to its slow onset and long duration, usage of this substance in this manner in unlikely to be favourable.

Like 2C-E and unlike many other psychedelics, 2C-P has the ability to be redosed after peaking quite successfully. For most drugs, there will be substantially diminished effects from the second dose, but there is minimal with 2C-P. However, due to the rather long delay before come up and long duration, many users of 2C-P may find this impractical.

**Legal Issues:**

Possession and sale of 2C-P is unscheduled in most countries.

- **UK:** 2C-P is a Class A drug.
- **USA:** 2C-P is a Schedule I drug.

**Conclusion:**

The subjective effects breakdown contained within this article was written and contributed by the PsychonautWiki admin known as [Cocoanatta](http://encyclopediapsychonautica.org/index.php?title=User:Cocoanatta).

As for the substance itself, this drug is perhaps one of the most interesting 2C-X compounds available today through the online market. It is extremely powerful in its effects and completely comparable with that of other more traditional psychedelic drugs such as LSD.

DESCRIPTION #
 
General Effects Notes
 Although it shares some qualities with 2C-E and other related phenethylamines, 2C-P appears to have unique and divergent characteristics that some people have found to be intense or challenging, particularly when taken in high doses. Reported effects include out-of-body experiences; confusing, dream-like realities and strong auditory and visual hallucinations. 
 
 
Addiction and Compulsive Use
 2C-P is not known to be associated with compulsive use and physical dependence is extremely unlikely. Because its use is so uncommon, no definitive statements about its use can be made.
 
EXPERIENCE EXCERPTS #
 
[8 mg, oral] "The trees around me and above me were frightening, taking on the characteristics of demons and giant dinosaur- like creatures. The sounds of creatures feasting and writhing in the distance became more pronounced, and closer. I imagined them charging towards me and I felt them breathing down my neck. My back ached and my feet burned from ant bites and splinters. After standing up, I stayed in place for a while staring up at the sky being utterly silent. A wave of fear and anguish came over me wondering if I would ever be sane again." -- [Exp 84690](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=84690)
 
[6 mg, oral] "The experience was not fun. It was far from pleasant. I experienced no severe emotional distress while on the drug. However, around the 9th hour, I started getting bummed out about the duration. I just wanted to sleep. I was exhausted. This drug is physically and psychologically very draining. Regardless, I see incredible therapeutic potential in this drug. Even at my low dose (6 mg), I realized how intense and unforgiving 2C-P could be." -- [Exp 84868](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=84868)
 
[8 mg, oral] "2c-p is a very inspiring drug artistically, affecting both my music and visual work. It could be helpful to writers, and probably anyone who can deal with the length and intensity of the trip." -- [Exp 34277](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=34277)
 
[9 mg, oral] "Visuals are insane." -- [Exp 34341](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=34341)
 
[10 mg, oral] "...some initial stomach discomfort and nausea--nothing too bad. 2cp was more relaxed than 2ci, deeper than 2cb, not as clinical or freaky as 2ce. I felt some jaw and back tension that was a bit painful at times. Visuals were not overwhelming but were pleasant," -- [Exp 83626](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=83626)
 
[10 mg, oral] "pretty overwhelmed. Visuals and swirling hitting hard, discomfort comes in waves and is mainly due to the intensity. I noticed stronger colourings in peripheral vision and movement in shadows, a slight trembling like on acid." -- [Exp 76011](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=76011)
 
[10 mg, oral] "I chatted on and on, happily energised, on how magick and nanotechnology and the like were really pretty much the same thing despite many pagan types mistrusting science and, more humorously, how there weren't enough performance enhancing drugs in sport since people try and enhance their performance every other way." -- [Exp 51687](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=51687)
 
[14 mg, oral] "My face and the top of my chest are still electrified. Still getting occasional body rushes. This drug is overstaying its welcome. For the next 4 hours I have an annoying tension in my face as though it's the last place for the drug to leave my body." -- [Exp 83066](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=83066)
 
[14 mg, oral] "I have never been so overwhelmed by a drug. I attribute the intensity of the experience to the bodily sensations as much as the hallucinations. I am almost constantly hit with intense rushes of trippiness. At one point the hallucinations were pretty scary and I found myself thinking I was going to fall into a 'bad trip'." -- [Exp 83066](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=83066)
 
[16 mg, oral] "Visuals were exceptionally intense, things would appear in mid-air, and not only that, but even my hallucinations would warp. There was a space of.. I would estimate.. an hour or so, where I left my body. My conciousness and spirit went away for a while, I was able to see into, and even explore different dimensions, each with their own laws of physics, and order. I think I almost had a heart attack about 5 times. [...] As far as the near heart attacks, it is not clear whether it was an actual severe problem, or if it was simply because I could feel each individual chamber doing its work. [...] There was certainly a marked increase in heart rate, whether this was related to the effects of the drug, or anxiety from seeing existence unravel in front of me, I do not know." -- [Exp 49785](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=49785)
 
[16 mg, oral] "I am getting a feeling through my body, very pleasant. Like rushes of energy. It is almost like an orgasm through the whole body." -- [Exp 44553](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=44553)

## SYNTHESIS
A total of 150 g mossy zinc was amalgamated by treatment with a solution of 15 g mercuric chloride in 1 L H2O. After swirling for 0.5 h, the H2O phase was removed by decantation and the zinc added to a 1 L three neck flask. To this there was added 20 mL H2O and 20 mL concentrated HCl, followed by 20 g of 2,5-dimethoxypropiophenone dissolved in 50 mL EtOH. This mixture was held at reflux with a heating mantle overnight, with the occasional addition of HCl as needed to maintain acidic conditions. After cooling to room temperature, the residual solids were removed by filtration, and the filtrate extracted once with 100 mL CH2Cl2 (this was the upper phase). Sufficient H2O was then added to allow extraction with 2Ã100 mL additional CH2Cl2 with the organic solvent being the lower phase. The combined organic extracts were washed twice with 5% NaOH, followed by one washing with dilute acid. Removal of the solvent under vacuum yielded 18 g of a dark brown oil that was distilled at the water pump to yield 7.2 g of 2,5-dimethoxypropylbenzene as a light yellow oil boiling at 90â130 Â°C.

A mixture of 22 g 2,5-dimethoxypropylbenzene, 23 g POCl3 and 22 g N-methylformanilide was heated on the steam bath for 1.5 h. The hot, dark reaction mass was poured into 1 L H2O, which allowed the eventual separation of 2,5-dimethoxy-4-n-propylbenzaldehyde as a clear yellow oil weighting 14 g. Although the homologous 4-ethyl and 4-butyl benzaldehydes were clean crystalline solids, this propyl homologue remained an oil. Gas chromatographic analysis showed it to be about 90% pure, and it was used as obtained in the nitrostyrene steps with either nitromethane (here) or nitroethane (under DOPR).

To a solution of 13 g 2,5-dimethoxy-4-n-propylbenzaldehyde in 100 mL nitromethane, there was added 1.3 g anhydrous ammonium acetate and the mixture held at reflux for 1 h. Removal of the solvent/reactant under vacuum yielded a spontaneously crystallizing mass of orange solids that was removed with the help of a little MeOH. After filtering and air drying there was obtained 7.5 g 2,5-dimethoxy-Î²-nitro-4-n-propylstyrene with a mp of 118â122 Â°C. Recrystallization from CH3CN gave an analytical sample with a mp 123â124 Â°C. Anal. (C13H17NO4) N.

In a 1 L round bottomed flask with a magnetic stirrer under a He atmosphere there was added 120 mL 1 M LAH in tetrahydrofuran. This stirred solution was cooled with an external ice bath, and there was added, dropwise, 3.2 mL of 100% H2SO4, freshly made by the addition of 13.5 g 20% fuming H2SO4 to 15.0 g of ordinary 96% concentrated H2SO4. When the addition was complete, a total of 7.2 g of dry 2,5-dimethoxy-Î²-nitro-4-n-propylstyrene was introduced as solids in several batches, against a flow of He, over the course of 20 min. The reaction mixture was allowed to come to room temperature, and stirred for an additional 0.5 h, then brought to reflux for 10 min on the steam bath. The excess hydride was destroyed with 18 mL IPA, and then sufficient 15% NaOH was added which made the aluminum oxides distinctly basic and of a filterable texture. The inorganics were removed by filtration, and the filter cake washed with additional THF. The combined filrate and washes were stripped of solvent, yielding several g of a pale yellow oil that was suspended in a large quantity of dilute H2SO4. The aqueous phase was filtered free of insolubles, washed with a little CH2Cl2, and made basic with aqueous NaOH. This was extracted with 3Ã40 mL CH2Cl2 and, after the removal of the solvent under vacuum, the residual 2 g of off-white oil was distilled. A fraction that distilled at 100â110 Â°C at 0.3 mm/Hg was water white, weighed 1.59 g and spontaneously crystallized. This fraction was dissolved in 7.5 mL warm IPA and neutralized with 0.6 mL concentrated HCl. The spontaneous crystals of 2,5-dimethoxy-4-n-propylphenethylamine hydrochloride (2C-P) were suspended in 20 mL anhydrous Et2O, filtered, Et2O washed, and air dried. The weight was 1.65 g and the mp was 207â209 Â°C with prior sintering at 183 Â°C., Anal. (C13H22ClNO2) N.


## DOSAGE

## QUALITATIVE COMMENTS
(with 8 mg) âComes on slowly, not feeling intently until into 2nd hour. I feel slight discomfort but override it responding to music. I take in air, directing it inside to heal uncomfortable places, open up my clogged sinuses. Wonderful experience of clean, fresh, healing air. Find that discomfort zone is places where I think there is something wrong with me. I dissolve these places with the feeling Iâm OK. Like myself better and better, and find more reasons to enjoy and appreciate myself. I find this material powerful, and an excellent working material. Under other circumstances, would probably spend more time working alone inside, where there were great openings, and some of the most beautiful visuals I have seen for a long time. Usually I do not get visuals. I like the long action. I feel that this material worked for a good week after the experience, with internal processes taking place, many insights, and energy running. At times the energy was a little uncomfortable, but could always be quelled by taking a moment for deep relaxation or looking directly at the internal process. I feel that much good internal work has been done, a lot of it unconscious.â

(with 9 mg) âAt the one hour point, I am barely off of baseline. It is not until almost the third hour that the experience is fully developed, and once there it is maintained for another four hours. I was well grounded but rather diffuse. I explored writing (which went quite well), interpretation (pictures and reading both OK) and talking (very good). This is an excellent level, and probably near the max.â

(with 12 mg) âSlow and even rise. At five minutes to seven (suddenly the clock time makes no sense at all) I am at a 3+ and feel that I have not yet plateauâd. Erotic was excellent. Music good. Eyes-closed imagery very different place than usual experiences. Slow, calm, strong images from an area that has no apparent connection with usual waking world, yet underlies all of it. A cool, wise place which has its own rules. All emotions and feeling available, but there is a cool perspective which informs all thinking. Talking superb and fun, and it was possible to feel our bodies healthy and full of determination to remain so, despite obvious faults and self-indulgences. Could do a lot of learning with this material, but probably not a group thing. It would lend itself too easily to hypnotic power-games, and it would be too easy to open up the shared consciousness level, which would be frightening to a lot of people and bring about necessary escapes such as sickness. Excellent feeling the next day.â

## Dosage & Duration

### Oral

**Dosage:**
- Threshold: 1 mg
- Light: 2 - 6 mg
- Common: 6 - 10 mg
- Strong: 10 - 16 mg
- Heavy: 16 mg +

**Duration:**
- Total: 10 - 20 hours
- Onset: 1 - 3 hours
- Come up: 2 - 4 hours
- Peak: 4 - 8 hours
- Offset: 3 - 6 hours
- After effects: 8 - 48 hours
**2C-P is very difficult to dose properly.**
 
Due to its unusually slow onset, long duration, and steep dose-response curve, it is strongly discouraged to re-dose 2C-P earlier than every 3 hours to a total of 2 milligrams above a previously evaluated dose. Also, even for experienced trippers, it is advised to not go above a *common* dose for the first time (see dosage table) per 70 kg body weight, as the session will last for several times longer compared to most psychedelics. Please see [this section](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-P#Toxicity_and_harm_potential) for more details.
**2,5-Dimethoxy-4-propylphenethylamine** (also known as **2C-P** ) is a lesser-known novel [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) substance of the [phenethylamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamine) class. 2C-P is a relatively obscure member of the [2C-x](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-x) family of psychedelic phenethylamines, which are closely related to the classical psychedelic [mescaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mescaline) . It is known as one of the most potent, dose-sensitive, and long-lasting of the series. Although the precise mechanism is not known, it is thought to produce its psychoactive effects by activating [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) [receptors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Receptors) in parts of the brain.

2C-P was first synthesized and tested for human activity by the American chemist [Alexander Shulgin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alexander_Shulgin) , who documented his findings in the 1991 book [PiHKAL](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PiHKAL) ("Phenethylamines I Have Known and Loved"). The reports found in the 2C-P PiHKAL entry remark on its depth and long onset and duration of action, with the commentary section describing 16 mg as a clear overdose with "physical consequences." The commentary also notes the small window separating an adequate dose from an excessive dose, suggesting it is relatively easy to overdose on.

[Subjective effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effects) include [open and closed-eye visuals](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Geometry) , [time distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Time_distortion) , [conceptual thinking](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Conceptual_thinking) , [euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Euphoria) , and [ego loss](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ego_loss) . User reports tend to characterize the effects of 2C-P in terms of its unusually long duration, powerful, sometimes overwhelming visuals, and intense "body load" consisting of [nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea) , [muscle tension](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_tension) , and general bodily discomfort. Some reports suggest it may be easier to experience agitation and [delirium](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delirium) on 2C-P than other 2C's, perhaps owing to the ease in which it can be mis-dosed. As a result, it is considered to have an unfavorable safety profile among psychedelics.

Very little data exists about the pharmacological properties, metabolism, and toxicity of 2C-P. Due its powerful effects and unusually long duration, 2C-P may be overly intense and difficult to use safely for those who are not highly experienced with [hallucinogens](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hallucinogens) . It is strongly advised to use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Harm_reduction_practices) if using this substance. These include avoiding "eye-balling" (i.e. measuring the dose with the naked eye instead of a reliable milligram scale) and non-oral [routes of administration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Routes_of_administration) . [Volumetric liquid dosing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Volumetric_liquid_dosing) is commonly recommended when dealing with substances of this potency.

## Chemistry

2C-P or 2,5-dimethoxy-4-propylphenethylamine is a substituted [phenethylamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamines) featuring a phenyl ring bound to an amino (NH 2 ) group through an ethyl chain. 2C-P contains methoxy functional groups CH 3 O- attached to carbons R 2 and R 5 and a propyl chain attached to carbon R 4 of the phenyl ring. 2C-P belongs to the 2C family of phenethylamines which contain methoxy groups on the 2 and 5 positions of the benzene ring.

## Pharmacology

2C-P is a relatively potent and long acting psychedelic phenethylamine of the 2C family which possesses stimulant type effects as well. It was first described by Alexander Shulgin in his book *[PiHKAL](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PiHKAL)* .

2C-P has been shown to produce a variety of intense [hallucinogenic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hallucinogenic) type effects ranging from drastic changes in consciousness and perception, to open and closed eye visuals. 2C-P is considered to be one of the strongest 2C-x compounds dosage for dosage, rivaled only by 2C-TFM.

2C-P's [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) effects are believed to come from its efficacy at the [5-HT2A receptor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin#The_5-HT_system) as a [partial agonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist#Agonists) . However, the role of these interactions and how it results in the [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) experience continues to remain elusive.

## Subjective effects

2C-P's head space and visuals have been described as possessing more similarities to alkylated 2C's like [2C-E](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-E) than halogenated members like [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) or [2C-I](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-I) .

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)** - 2C-P is considered to be very energetic and stimulating in a fashion that is comparable to that of [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) , [2C-I](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-I) and other substances within the [2C-x](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-x) family, being encouraged instead of forced.
- **[Spontaneous bodily sensations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_bodily_sensations)** - In comparison to [2C-E](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-E) or [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) , the "body high" of 2C-P can be considered as mild although still capable of becoming very powerful and highly physically euphoric. It is similar yet distinct from the "body high" experienced on [2C-E](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-E) , [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) , and [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) . The sensation itself can be described as intense and will manifest itself in the form of a continuously shifting tingling sensation that travels up and down the body in spontaneous waves. This is coupled by an equally intense yet slightly uncomfortable energetic pins and needles sensation that constantly encompasses a person’s entire body as well as a slight warm glow that manifests itself much less consistently than the other two physical components. All of these are capable of becoming very physically euphoric.
- **[Tactile enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_enhancement)** - This effect is particularly prominent but capable of going in both pleasurable and uncomfortable directions. This can result in pleasurable tactile sensations but also enhances bodily aches and pains which one may not have previously been aware of to the point of extreme discomfort.
- **[Bodily control enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bodily_control_enhancement)**
- **[Temperature regulation suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Temperature_regulation_suppression)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] - 2C-P is reported to be able to cause large perceived increases and decreases in temperature in a dose dependent manner. This can become extremely uncomfortable if not dangerous at larger doses due to the fever-like delirium that is sometimes reported. 
- **[Increased bodily temperature](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_bodily_temperature)**
- **[Increased heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Increased blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea)** - Mild to extreme nausea is consistently reported when consumed in moderate to high dosages and either passes once the user has vomited or gradually fades by itself as the peak sets in.
- **[Increased libido](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_libido)** - A common theme found in many 2C-P reports is the way in which it can heighten and enhance sexual arousal. When experienced, this sensation is not overwhelming or out of control but simply remains something that the user is constantly aware of. If sexual activities of any kind are engaged in, they are have been reported to be immensely more pleasurable than anything that can be achieved in a sober state.
- **[Pupil dilation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pupil_dilation)**
- **[Teeth grinding](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Teeth_grinding)** - A very common effect of 2C-P, and more pronounced with 2C-P than other 2C's or psychedelic substances in general. Can become very uncomfortable, especially with higher doses. ### Visual effects
 
- #### Enhancements
 
- **[Colour enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_enhancement)**
- **[Pattern recognition enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition_enhancement)**
- **[Visual acuity enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_acuity_enhancement)**
 
#### Distortions
 
- **[Drifting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting)** *( [melting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Melting) , [flowing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Flowing) , [breathing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Breathing) and [morphing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#_morphing) )* - In comparison to other psychedelics, this effect can be described as highly detailed, slow and smooth in motion, static in appearance and unrealistic/cartoon-like in style.
- **[Tracers](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tracers)**

#### Geometry
 
The visual geometry present can be described as being more similar in appearance to that of [4-AcO-DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocetin) or [ayahuasca](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ayahuasca) than that of [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) , [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) or [2C-I](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-I) . They can be comprehensively described as structured in their organization, organic in geometric style, intricate in complexity, large in size, fast and smooth in motion, colorful in scheme, glossy in color, sharp in their edges and equally rounded and angular in their corners. It gives off a contradictory natural and synthetic feel that at higher dosages are significantly more likely to result in states of [Level 8B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/8B_Geometry) visual geometry over [Level 8A](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Level_8A) . There seems to be visual geometry that is distinct from [2C-E](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-E) , [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) and [ayahuasca](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ayahuasca) and can be described as faster moving and more intense in proportion to cognitive and physical effects than [2C-E](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-E) .
 
#### Hallucinatory states
 
2C-P produces a full range of high level hallucinatory states in a fashion that is more consistent and reproducible than that of many other commonly used psychedelics. This holds particularly true in comparison to other 2C-x [phenethylamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamines) such as [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) or [2C-I](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-I) . These effects include:
 
- **[Machinescapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Machinescapes)**
- **[Transformations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Transformations)**
- **[Internal hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucination)** ( *[autonomous entities](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Autonomous_entities)* ; *[settings, sceneries, and landscapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Settings,_sceneries,_and_landscapes)* ; *[perspective hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perspective_hallucinations)* and *[scenarios and plots](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenarios_and_plots)* ) - In comparison to other psychedelics such as [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) , 2C-P is extremely high in hallucinations embedded within visual [geometry](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Geometry) . This particular effect commonly contains hallucinations with scenarios, settings, concepts and autonomous entity contact. They are more common within dark environments and can be described as lucid in believability, interactive in style and almost exclusively of a personal, religious, spiritual, science-fiction, fantasy, surreal, nonsensical or transcendental nature in their overall theme.
- **[Unspeakable horrors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Unspeakable_horrors)** - This is an effect that is typically associated with [deliriants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Deliriants) rather than [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) . Based on anecdotal reports, they only tend to occur at higher doses and are likely a result of the pronounced temperature increasing properties this substance has compared to other [2C-x](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-x) and [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) , which can lend readily to [delirium](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delirium) -like states. ### Cognitive effects
 
- The cognitive effects of 2C-P have been described as both insightful and relatively normal in their thought processes up to moderate dosages, after which their confusing, and disorienting effects can increase considerably.

## Toxicity and harm potential

The toxicity and long-term health effects of recreational 2C-P use do not seem to have been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dose is unknown. This is because 2C-P is a [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) with very little history of human usage.

Anecdotal reports suggests that there are no negative health effects attributed to simply trying the substance by itself at low to moderate doses and using it very sparingly (but nothing can be completely guaranteed). [Independent research](https://www.google.com/) should always be done to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe before consumption.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this substance.

### Overdose
**2C-P is difficult to dose properly, and requires patience. Be aware that impulsive overdosing can lead to an overdose. Please structure a calculated dosage regimen and stick to it.**
 
- 2C-P has a **steep dose-response curve** : As little as a few extra milligrams separating a manageable dose and an overdose. Users who wish to take high doses of this compound are advised to titrate upward slowly, use reliable milligram scales to measure doses, and avoid non-oral routes of administration such as insufflation or injection.
- 2C-P has a **very slow onset** : The peak effects reportedly do not occur for 1 to 3 hours. Thus it's advised to wait for *at least* 3 hours before re-dosing is considered, and even longer for full stomach content.
- 2C-P has a **very long half-life** : The anecdotal estimated elimination half-life is 19 hours.
The LD 50 of 2C-P has not been established. However, it is believed that 2C-P is likely to have a smaller therapeutic window compared to other 2C's, meaning a lethal dose may be achieved more easily.

In 2017, a 25-year old British female died following the ingestion of a large dose of 2C-P at a music festival. No source reported clear evidence that 2C-P by itself led to the immediate death of the female.

### Dependence and abuse potential

As a [serotonergic psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonergic_psychedelic) , 2C-P is considered to have a low potential for abuse and dependence.

Tolerance to the effects of 2C-P is built almost immediately after ingestion. After that, it takes about 3 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 7 days to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). 2C-P produces cross-tolerance with all [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) , meaning that after the consumption of 2C-P all psychedelics will have a reduced effect.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **[Lithium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_(medication))** - Lithium is commonly prescribed for the treatment of [bipolar disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder) . There is a large body of anecdotal evidence that suggests taking it with [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) significantly increases the risk of [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) and [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) . As a result, this combination is strictly discouraged.
- **[Cannabis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cannabis)** - Cannabis may have an unexpectedly strong and unpredictable synergy with the effects of 2C-P. Caution is advised with this combination as it can significantly increase the risk of adverse psychological reactions like [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) , and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) . Users are advised to start off with only a fraction of their normal cannabis dose and take long breaks between hits to avoid unintentional overdose.
- **[Stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants)** - Stimulants like [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) , [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) or [methylphenidate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylphenidate) affect many parts of the brain and alter [dopaminergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) function. This combination can increase the risk of [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) , and [thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops) . This interaction may also result in an elevated risk of [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) . [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol)** - Tramadol is well-documented to lower the seizure threshold and [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) may act to trigger seizures in susceptible individuals. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

## Legal status

2C-P is not scheduled under the UN Convention on Psychotropic Substances. It is considered to exist in a legal grey area in many countries, meaning that while it is not specifically illegal, individuals may still be charged for its possession under certain circumstances such as under analogue laws and with the intent to sell or consume.

- **Austria** : 2C-P is illegal to possess, produce and sell under the NPSG (Neue-Psychoaktive-Substanzen-Gesetz Österreich). In its Schedule II, the further specifying NPSV (Neue-Psychoaktive-Substanzen-Verordnung Österreich) explicitly bans all substituted phenetylamines.
- **Canada** : 2C-P would be considered Schedule III as it is a derivative of 2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine.
- **China** : As of October 2015, 2C-P is a controlled substance in China.
- **Denmark** : 2C-P is on the list of Schedule B controlled substances.
- **Germany** : 2C-P is controlled under Anlage I BtMG ( *Narcotics Act, Schedule I* ) as of December 13, 2014. It is illegal to manufacture, possess, import, export, buy, sell, procure or dispense it without a license.
- **Japan** : 2C-P is a controlled substance in Japan effective March 25th, 2015.
- **Latvia** : 2C-P is a Schedule I controlled substance.
- **Switzerland** : 2C-P is a controlled substance specifically named under Verzeichnis E.
- **Turkey:** 2C-P is a classed as drug and is illegal to possess, produce, supply, or import.
- **The Netherlands:** 2C-P is currently legal, but it is part of a substance group that may be banned soon as part of a recently passed law on New Psychoactive Substances (NPS).
- **United Kingdom** : 2C-P is a Class A drug in the United Kingdom as a result of the phenethylamine catch-all clause.
- **United States** : 2C-P is a Schedule I controlled substance. This means 2C-P is illegal to manufacture, buy, possess, process, or distribute without a license from the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).

*Source: https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/2C-P*

**2C-P** is a rather uncommon psychedelic compound of the 2C-X family of substances. It's considered to be a strong and long-lasting psychedelic phenethylamine which possesses stimulant effects as well. MG for MG it is only rivaled by 2C-TFM. It's been known to have a very long come-up with some users reporting it taking up to 3-5 hours after consumption before any psychoactive effects begin to occur. Yet it is unique in its own right. 

## History

It was first synthesized by Alexander Shulgin in 1974. Like most of the other 2C-X family it's highly dose sensitive. It has been compared to 2C-E in effects except it is longer in duration. 

## Dosage

The dosage for this drug is very sensitive so you may want to look at the links provided: [Quick Guide to Volumetric Dosing](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/Quick_Guide_to_Volumetric_Dosing) and [Scales](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/Scales)

{{#tdose: 2cp }}

## Duration

2C-P can have a very long duration (up to around 16-22 hours) so be prepared if you plan on taking this substance to make sure to take that into account. 
Most experiences within the dosages above last around 10-16 hours.  
This substance is very dose dependant. 

| Onset | 60 minutes to several hours. |

2C-P, also known as 4-propyl-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine or as Selene, is a psychedelic drug of the phenethylamine and 2C families. It is taken orally and is among the most potent and long-lasting of the 2C psychedelics.
2C-P was first described in the literature by Alexander Shulgin in his 1991 book PiHKAL (Phenethylamines I Have Known and Loved) in 1991.

## Use and effects

In his book PiHKAL (Phenethylamines I Have Known and Loved), Alexander Shulgin lists 2C-P's dose range as 6 to 10 mg orally and its duration as 10 to 16 hours. A wider dosage range of 1 to 16 mg or more, with a typical dose estimate of 7 mg, has also been reported. Shulgin wrote in PiHKAL that while most reports with doses of 6 to 12 mg were positive, a single report of 16 mg was described as a clear overdose and "physical disaster" that was "not to be repeated". He described the drug as having a steep dose–response curve and advised careful individual dose titration. 2C-P is also said to come on slowly, with an onset of 1 to 2 hours and peak effects not occurring until after 3 hours. The drug is one of the most potent psychedelics of the 2C family, rivaled only by 2C-TFM. It is taken orally.
The effects of 2C-P have been reported to include closed-eye imagery, beautiful psychedelic visuals, insights, emotional enhancement, increased appreciation of music and eroticism, feelings of energy flowing through oneself, physical discomfort, back and leg pain, next-day hangover, and an afterglow.

## Overdose

Unknown or unreported doses taken by teenagers at a Connecticut, United States concert in September 2013 caused seven people to require emergency medical help including CPR and defibrillation to resuscitate some of them, with all seven being taken to a hospital and four of those being hospitalized until at least the next day. It was reported that none of the overdose victims died while CNN's "OutFront" blog claimed the police called it a "mass casualty event" blaming the problems on 2C-P and drugs apparently being sold as "Molly", a common name for MDMA.
Louella Fletcher-Michie, the daughter of actor John Michie, died from a 2C-P overdose in September 2017 at the Bestival festival in Dorset, United Kingdom, the first reported death from 2C-P. Her boyfriend was found guilty of manslaughter, for giving her the drug and failing to act to help her for over six hours after she overdosed. His conviction for failing to act was quashed in August 2020.

## Interactions

2C drugs like 2C-P are known to be metabolized by the monoamine oxidase (MAO) enzymes MAO-A and MAO-B. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) such as phenelzine, tranylcypromine, moclobemide, and selegiline may potentiate the effects of 2C drugs like 2C-P. This may result in overdose and serious toxicity.

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

2C-P acts as an agonist of the serotonin 5-HT2 receptors. It also binds to the serotonin 5-HT1A receptor with about 14-fold lower affinity than for the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor. The drug shows little or no affinity for the monoamine transporters (MATs) and shows very weak or negligible monoamine reuptake inhibition. It shows high affinity for the rat trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1) and lower but still high affinity for the mouse TAAR1.
In contrast to many other psychedelics, 2C-P, as well as 2C-C and certain 2C NBOMe analogues, has shown reinforcing effects in rodents. It produces dose-dependent conditioned place preference (CPP) in mice and self-administration in rats. These findings suggest that 2C-P may have misuse potential. The mechanism by which these effects are produced is unknown. However, 2C-P was found to decrease dopamine transporter (DAT) expression and to increase DAT phosphorylation in the nucleus accumbens similarly to methamphetamine in rodents. Decreased DAT expression may result in reduced dopamine reuptake, while DAT phosphorylation is associated with dopamine reverse transport and efflux, in turn increasing extracellular dopamine levels.
2C-P has also been found to produce neurotoxicity at high doses in rodents, which appears to be mediated via neuroinflammation.
The drug only weakly inhibits the monoamine oxidases.

## Chemistry

2C-P is 2,5-dimethoxy-4-n-propylphenethylamine. The full name of the chemical is 2-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-propylphenyl)ethanamine. The hydrochloride salt is the most common form, normally found as a white powder, or white crystals.

### Properties

Alexander Shulgin's 2C-P crude freebase (soluble in chloroform), after "removal of the solvent under vacuum," was an off-white colored oil which he distilled at 100–110 °C at 40 Pa (0.3 mmHg) (turning it "water white" in color), and it "spontaneously crystallized" upon cooling.

### Synthesis

The chemical synthesis of 2C-P has been described.

### Analogues

Analogues of 2C-P include 2C-D, 2C-E, 2C-Bu, 2C-iP, and 2C-iBu, among others.

## History

2C-P was first described in the literature by Alexander Shulgin in his 1991 book PiHKAL (Phenethylamines I Have Known and Loved) in 1991.

## Society and culture

### Popular culture

In the first episode of the CBS fictional TV drama series Battle Creek, a local police detective is tasked with solving a double murder where an assisting FBI agent claims the victims were operating a clandestine laboratory manufacturing 2C-P.
