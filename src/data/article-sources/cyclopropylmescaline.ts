## SYNTHESIS
A suspension of 1.3 g LAH in 65 mL anhydrous THF under He was cooled to 0 Â°C with stirring, and 0.85 mL of 100% H2SO4 was slowly added. Then, with continued stirring, a THF solution of 2.7 g of 4-cyclopropylmethoxy-3,5-dimethoxyphenylacetonitrile in 50 mL THF was added dropwise. After the addition was complete, the mixture was brought to a boil briefly on the steam bath, cooled, and treated with sufficient IPA to destroy the excess hydride. Then there was added an amount of 15% NaOH sufficient to produce a loose filterable solid form of aluminum oxide. This was removed by filtration, and the filter cake washed with THF. The pooled filtrate and washes were stripped of solvent, and the residue was dissolved in dilute H2SO4, washed with 2Ã50 mL CH2Cl2, made basic with aqueous NaOH, and then extracted with 2Ã50 mL of CH2Cl2. After removal of the solvent, the residue was distilled at 128â140 Â°C at 0.4 mm/Hg to yield 2.5 g of a white oil. This was dissolved in 10 mL IPA, and treated with 30 drops of concentrated HCl which was just sufficient to demonstrate acidity as judged by external dampened pH paper. The addition of 25 mL anhydrous Et2O to the stirred solution allowed, in a few minutes, the product 4-cyclopropylmethoxy-3,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine hydrochloride (CPM) to spontaneously crystallize as a fine white solid. The yield was 1.8 g, and a second crop of 0.8 g was obtained from the IPA/Et2O mother liquors. The mp was 172â173 Â°C. Anal. (C14H22ClNO3) C,H.


## DOSAGE

## DURATION

## QUALITATIVE COMMENTS
(with 70 mg) âThere is a goodly amount of eyes-closed patterning but I found external sounds to be irritating. Voices, and even music, seemed to be intrusive. I didnât want to share my space with anyone. I was reminded of mescaline, in that I kept losing the awareness of the drugâs role in my experience. Visual exaggerations are probably right around the corner. The residual effects were too much to ignore, but 100 milligrams of phenobarb at about the twelth hour allowed me to lie down quietly.â

(with 80 mg) âA wild day of profound philosophy, with discussions of the art of molecules, the origins of the universe, and similar weighty trivia. Much day-dreaming in erotic areas, but by and large, it went on a bit too long. I was tired.â


## EXTENSIONS AND COMMENTARY
The cyclopropylmethyl group plays an interesting role in the world of narcotics. There are numerous examples of opiates with a methyl group attached to a nitrogen atom which are famous for being valuable in producing analgesia and sedation. These run the gamut from natural alkaloids such as morphine and codeine, to synthetic variants such as Dilaudid and Percodan. And yet, with most of these narcotics, when the methyl on the nitrogen is removed, and a cyclopropylmethyl group put into its place, the agonist becomes an antagonist. Oxycodone (the active narcotic thing in Percodan) becomes Naltrexone, a drug that will immediately snap a heroin victim out of his overdose.

Cyclopropylmescaline (CPM) is a molecule that is very simply mescaline itself, with a methyl group removed from an oxygen atom and a cyclopropylmethyl group put on instead. Might CPM be not only inactive, but actually block the action of mescaline? Interesting concept. But it turned out to be entirely wrong.

The amphetamine analog of CPM should be easily made from the alkylation of syringaldehyde with cyclopropyl chloride, followed by conventional reaction of the resulting aldehyde with nitroethane, and finally a reduction step. There is no reason to believe that the resulting compound 3,5-dimethoxy-4-cyclopropyloxyamphetamine (3C-CPM) would be any shorter acting than CPM.

Cyclopropylmescaline (CPM), also known as 4-cyclopropylmethoxy-3,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine, is a psychedelic drug of the phenethylamine and scaline families related to mescaline. It is taken orally and has a very long duration of 12 to 18 hours.

## Use and effects

In his book PiHKAL (Phenethylamines I Have Known and Loved) and other publications, Alexander Shulgin lists the dose range of CPM as 60 to 80 mg and its duration as 12 to 18 hours. Its onset is within 20 minutes and peak effects occurred at around 1.5 hours. The drug is approximately 5 times as potent as mescaline and is longer-lasting in comparison.
The effects of CPM have been reported to include remarkable closed-eye visuals and fantasy, mental imagery synchronized with music, not much in terms of open-eye visuals, heightened tactile awareness, not much insight, daydreaming about eroticism, feeling exposed and vulnerable, sounds including voices and even music feeling intrusive and irritating, and interference with sleep and feeling tired due to its very long duration.

## Interactions

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

CPM acts as a serotonin 5-HT2 receptor full agonist, including of the serotonin 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, and 5-HT2C receptors.

## Chemistry

### Synthesis

The chemical synthesis of CPM has been described.

### Analogues

Analogues of CPM include mescaline, escaline, proscaline, allylescaline, methallylescaline, and cycloproscaline, among others.

## History

CPM was described in the scientific literature by Alexander Shulgin by 1994. Subsequently, it was further described by Shulgin in his 1991 book PiHKAL (Phenethylamines I Have Known and Loved).
