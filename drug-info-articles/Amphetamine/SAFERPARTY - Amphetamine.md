## Effects
The release of the endogenous neurotransmitters noradrenalin and dopamine produced by the use of amphetamine can cause a feeling of increased performance, an increase in self-esteem, an increase in body temperature, the suppression of tiredness, hunger and thirst, an increased willingness to take risks and a suppressed feeling of pain, and can lead to euphoria as well as an increased urge to talk (babble flash).

## Dosage
Because of the varying purity (the amphetamine content varies from almost 0 % to almost 100 %!), dosing is difficult and the risk of overdose is high. Doses of more than 25 mg of pure amphetamine increase the negative effects. A dose of 50 mg/night should be the maximum, whether snorted or swallowed.

## Risks

### Short-term Risks
Tremors, restlessness, nausea, palpitations and cardiac arrhythmias, sleep disturbances, headaches, nervousness, irritability, loss of appetite, aggressive behaviour and, in combination with alcohol, danger of alcohol poisoning. At high doses: hallucinations, circulatory failure, strokes as well as kidney, liver and heart failure and states of deep unconsciousness. An often underestimated danger is the rise in body temperature, which can lead to dehydration of the body. In high doses, acute amphetamine psychosis can occur. Signs of this are hallucinations in the form of colour spots and with features of schizophrenia. The risk of such an acute mental disorder increases with consumption over several days and/or if high doses are taken and food intake and sleep are neglected over a longer period of time. Such an experience usually normalises after sufficient sleep. During and after coming down: extreme need for sleep, exhaustion, strong feeling of hunger,depressive mood, irritability, etc.

### Long-term Risks
There is a risk of addiction with psychological symptoms, especially if the use takes on a (performance-enhancing) function in everyday life (e.g. at work) or physical/psychological exhaustion is combated with amphetamine. Frequent use of amphetamine not infrequently leads to physical deficiency symptoms (e.g. calcium deficiency, which can lead to bone and tooth problems) and to psychological problems such as dejection or listlessness. Regular and high-dose use can lead to constant restlessness (but also persistent fatigue), sleep and circulatory disorders as well as anxiety disorders up to persistent amphetamine psychosis with paranoid delusions. In addition, high blood pressure, cardiac arrhythmias, weight loss, skin inflammations ("speed pimples"), stomach problems as well as liver and kidney damage and cramps are possible. Snorting damages the nasal mucous membranes and the nasal septum, swallowing damages the stomach mucous membranes. Chronic consumption also favours brain haemorrhages and strokes with sudden paralysis.

## Safer Use
- Dose low. Think about how long you want to be awake before you take it! Do not suppress your need for sleep.
- The lowest-risk form of amphetamine use is to swallow it.
- Eat enough after consumption to prevent weight loss.
- Drink enough (non-alcoholic drinks).
- Take extra vitamin C and D and minerals (iron, calcium and magnesium) with frequent use.
- Follow the safer-sniffing rules when sniffing.
- Refrain from mixed consumption! Make sure to take breaks from consumption.
- Mentally ill persons, persons with high blood pressure, liver and kidney diseases, diabetics and pregnant women should refrain from using amphetamines.
- It is better not to wear headgear (danger of overheating!).
- Amphetamine pastes should always be well dried before consumption.

## Adulterants & Extenders

In both powders and pastes, the amphetamine is chemically present as sulphate. Pastes were not sufficiently dried after production or were subsequently brought into paste form with a liquid extender. These liquid extenders are solvents (e.g. isopropyl alcohol or phenylacetone) which are toxic. Therefore, amphetamine pastes should always be well dried before consumption!

### Common Adulterants

**Synthesis Byproducts**
In addition to DPIA (bis-amphetamine or di(beta-phenylisopropyl)amines), these were 4-methyl-5-phenylpyrimidine and numerous other synthesis by-products.

**Dimethylterephthalate**
Dimethyl terephthalate is a basic material for the technical production of polyesters, for example polyethylene terephthalate (PET) or polybutylene terephthalate (PBT). It is also used in the production of polyester resins for films, lacquers and adhesives and of 1,4-dimethylolcyclohexane. The abbreviation for dimethyl terephthalate is DMT, it is possible that there is confusion here with Dimethyltryptamine whose abbreviation is also DMT.

**Amitriptyline**
Amitriptyline is approved for the treatment of depression and is used for all forms of depressive disorders. Amitriptyline is also approved for the long-term treatment of pain.

**Phenylacetone**
Phenylacetone (1-phenyl-2-probanone) is a colourless to pale yellow liquid with a strong, characteristic odour. Phenylacetone is used in the chemical industry for synthesis purposes; it can be used to produce amphetamine by means of reductive amination. Phenylacetone is highly flammable and toxic. It is both a synthesis by-product and a potential extender; the powdered amphetamine sulphate can be reliquefied and the product sold as amphetamine paste.

**4-MeA**
4-MeA is a stimulant that causes a release of the monoamine neurotransmitters. Similar to MDMA, these are dopamine, noradrenaline and serotonin.

**Caffeine**
Alkaloid found in coffee beans, tea and mate leaves, kola nuts and guarana seeds.

**4-FA**
4-FA (1-(4-fluorophenyl)propan-2-amine) belongs to the phentylamine family (related to methamphetamine, cathinone and methcathinone).
