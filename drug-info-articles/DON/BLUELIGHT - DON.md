Here we go, been friends with this guy when he lived around here, always been wanting to try DON, DOB sucks ass and its just as easily made... easy one to make..   He's had DOM, DON, DOB, DOI then DOC, impressed with DOC, but it wasn't DOM, and DON was still #2, so yes i still want to try this ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I have been wanting to try this one for a long time, it sounds the most pleasant of the DOx series. I have seen info saying it is pretty common on blotter in russia, so you would think there would be more TR's out there![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif)

i remember hearing rumors that this one will be the next DOx to surface. This was right after DOC came out on the market almost 2 years ago or so.


It still hasnt really surfaced. Just a few reports. I think there is two on bluelight.


DOM ended up showing up before DON did which i thought would have been impossible but i sure am glad it ended up working out that way.

Heh.  I hope some reports come in sometime for this.  Anyone know where some are?  I think there are a few in TR... I'll try to dig them up and link to them here so this B&D thread contains something useful. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

Yeah, from the reports I've read, it seems like a fairly interesting substance. Hopefully some attention to this would trigger additional reports as well.

People writing on how much do they want to obtain the subject chemical in threads like this one amuse me.

I should argue on the positive image of this chemical in this thread or few others closely related. I see people here complaining about DON being unavailable at their location, it looks as if with the advent of China on the drug market your local synthetic drugs manufacturers died out as a class. But I can assure you that in being unable to try it you haven't missed anything special.

Indeed, common enough to make some general observations. It appears to be the least pleasant substance of the common DOx and has a negative image of a second-rate blotters base-drug, though also shows up in a powder form more or less frequently. The percentage of people taking it negatively seem to be higher than that of DOB, or roughly equal. 


The most common complaints are about it not being psychedelic in any way - true, it is much closer to 2C-X like 2C-B or I in this respect.


Or about it being excessively stimulative, also true, and DOB or DOC or DOI or DOM do not even come close to it in this respect. 


Side effects being severe, well, it does have a lot of unpleasant physyology but in contrast to DOB it doesn't seem to be the central point of the popular negative attitude. 


It's main effects to be nothing more than sensory noise. This is the worst thing about it, though I'd notice they are less noisy with smaller doses, <2 mg.


The experience to be dark and without relief up to the end - this is not something unavoidable, but still a common thing, this chemical tend to focus attention on dark and nasty things both in memories/imagination and surroundings. I've heard several different people calling it "gothic".


It's another distinguishing feature not actually to be adressed as "bad" are the visual effects - those are among the weirdest I've seen in psychedelic phenylethylamines.

Can you compare the visual effects of DON with something else?

I've heard rumors that this substance has a very powerfull, overwhelming visual component.

Is it true?

I don't think I know any other psychedelic with the visual phenomena like that. If I'll say it has some resemblance to chlorine (DOC) it won't be descriptive enough. For me it also has resemblance to AMT (alpha-methyl tryptamine). This is also not descriptive at all if we are to describe 2,5-dimethoxy-4-nitro visual phenomena. 


So I have to say they are unique to some extent. At the same time all the nitros are alike, 2C-N is much less visual but resembles DON anyway, NBOMe-2C-N is even more visual, and also qualitatively it feels like a relief from the nitro nastiness I described above. It is a psychedelic I may have an intention to take, while most probably I won't ever take DON. NBOMe-2C-N visual phenomena has some resemblance with DMT in highest doses, something several different people have noted and I have also experienced myself, although it is not anything like DMT in any other way. DON has no such resemblance with DMT for me though.

Not that too powerfull, rather equal to that of others DOX, like DOB or DOI.
