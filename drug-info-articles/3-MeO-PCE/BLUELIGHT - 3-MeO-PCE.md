Forgive me if this has been covered recently,but I am new.Are they discontinuing all generic forms of prescription narcotics?I've heard bits and pieces,here and there on this topic.If so,this obviously means prices for scripts will be higher.Is this to keep better control of the drugs?

Jasper, welcome to Bluelight.  I'm moving this to the appropriate forum (Basic Drug Discussion).  Apologies to BDD mods if this thread violates your rules.

No, the US is not discontinuing all forms of generic narcotics. That would definitely be in the news. Some generic drugs (of various types) do get discontinued, which is nothing new, the explanation is usually that because the brand names are advertised and people ask for them there are not enough prescriptions filled for XYZ drug to warrant continuing to make it. Brand name drugs get discontinued too, for various reasons. But there is no generic-wide mass discontinuation happening.

I think what he is referring to is the end of vicodin generics in their current form. They are now available with only 300 mg APAP, the originals being phased out in the next year or two. Generic Norco isn't going anywhere though.

Hell no. And it sucks because NO MATTER WHAT PEOPLE SAY OR ARGUE some generics fucking suck compared to the brand name. I remember back in the day when I did opiates the Mallckindrot brand of hydrocodone (m357 imprint) seriously had NO effect on me. However I believe some generics are pretty equivalent (My seroquel and adderall scripts are pretty on point).
