## Subjective Experience

Wild dagga is one of the better known natural sedatives, particularly in southern
Africa. It has been used as a remedy for a significant number of ailments, and
recreationally, as an occasional substitute for cannabis. My notes at the time of
testing were as follows:

```
Also known as Lion's Tail and Wild Dagga, Erowid classifies this as a
Sedative; Intoxicant, and it was my latest venture into the ethnobotanical
arena. It was quite pricey, but did it work?
```
```
Online reviews are mixed, but this seems to be the most common sentiment:
```
```
“It is a nice smoking blend but don’t buy it if you are looking to get
high. It does have some calming effects but just slightly. It's nothing
like pot is what I’m saying.” ~ Danlennon3, shroomery.org
```

```
Last week I tried smoking it. It was a bit rough, and tasted pretty nasty. In
terms of psychoactive effect, there was some, but nothing notable or
particularly pleasing.
```
```
Unperturbed I decided to vape, having identified a couple of temperature
recommendations [150°C to 175°C (302°F to 347°F)]. This produced a minor
background effect, but not really what I was hoping for from my £10.
```
```
Smoking it in a bong, as opposed to rolling it into a joint, I found the effect to
be a little stronger. It helped that it was more pleasing from an aesthetic
perspective.
```
```
Tonight I tried wild dagga tea. I used about 14g over several cups. This was
much better. There was no particular high; just a mellow buzz and a mild
lifting of anxiety. I wouldn’t describe it as being stoned, but the psychoactivity
was definitely there, and was quite pleasant.
```
```
In making these observations I should note that most of the wild dagga I have
seen for sale on the Internet is more colourful than mine. It is possible that it
is more potent.
```
```
Overall, I found this to be more pleasing and sedating when taken as a tea,
although nowhere near as active as, for example, kanna or kratom. It did,
however, produce one final surprise: on retiring to bed I felt that there was
some form of oneirogenic reaction, albeit minor.
```
At a later date I managed to obtain a fresher batch of this material. This felt cleaner,
and I found smoking to be slightly more rewarding than described above.

This certainly creates a buzz-like sedation, at the lower end of the scale, but it is not a
plant I am particularly drawn to return to.
