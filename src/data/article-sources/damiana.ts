## Subjective Experience

I had dabbled with damiana tea on a number of occasions, and had marked it firmly
down as, at best, a slightly relaxing herbal drink. It was only after I had smoked it
with hashish, as a filler, that I began to suspect that there may be more to it. Stand-
alone experimentation via this RoA proved this to be the case.

The intensity of the first couple of smoking experiences came as a surprise, as
reflected in one of my forum posts at the time:

\`\`\`
Damiana has been used traditionally in Central America and the northern
parts of South America for many centuries. The Mayas and Aztecs, for
example, used it as an aphrodisiac and a relaxant.
\`\`\`

\`\`\`
Strangely, identification of its active psychoactive content has proven to be
problematic. Azarius.com describes this apparent conundrum in the following
terms:
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
"Damiana contains from 0.5% to 1% of a complex volatile oil (thymol,
alpha-copaene, 8cadinene, calamene, 1,8 cineole, alpha pinene, beta
pinene, calamenene) that gives the plant its characteristic odor and
flavor. It also contains the flavonoids and tannins. None of these
ingredients are known to have psychoactive or aphrodisiac qualities.
Hence there is no substantive data available to confirm the claimed
effects."
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
Whilst this may imply that damiana is a psychoactive dud, studies with rats
have demonstrated "increased sexual activity in sexually exhausted or
impotent males" (Wikipedia, ref: sciencedirect.com, ncbi.nlm.nih.gov).
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
This is scant evidence, of course. More persuasive may be the number of ad
hoc reports scattered around the Internet which unambiguously cite its
effectiveness as a sedative, and indeed, its value as an aphrodisiac.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
Some people will be familiar with this herb as the foliage used in spice and
other synthetic cannabinoid brands, as sold in shiny packets from head shops.
In this context however, any effect from damiana would be almost completely
expunged by whatever chemical was sprayed upon to it.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
Others have used it with cannabis, for which the same question applies: what
effect is produced courtesy of the weed, and what effect is invoked via the
damiana, if any? Most tokers assume everything stems from the former.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
How many here have smoked damiana alone? Or taken it as a tea?
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
My first experiment was via the latter, which is the most common method of
stand-alone use. The experience was underwhelming. A gentle relaxing aura
emerged, but it was very mild. As an aphrodisiac, again, perhaps there was
something there, but certainly not in comparison to serious stimulants or
empathogens.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
Smoking it, however, produced an entirely different outcome. Indeed, my
initial expectation was such that its effects took me entirely by surprise.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
Sedating? Relaxing? Yes. It wasn’t in the same league of cannabis, but equally,
it wasn’t a placebo effect, nor was it barely noticeable. It actually worked: it
was calming and there was a small mood life courtesy of an anxiolytic edge.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
Was there any evidence that this could be used as an aphrodisiac? Yes, there
was. This was not on the stim-binge level, but it was certainly there, and the
phenomenon of stim-dick was entirely absent.
\`\`\`

\`\`\`
The experience lasted perhaps a couple of hours or so, as I slowly worked
through the joint. However, yet another effect emerged later, in the form of
repeated and lucid dreaming.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
Since this experiment I have used damiana occasionally, and always on a dry
day. In other words, when not under the influence of any other chemical or
botanical, and usually when I am at a loose end, just wanting to chill. It is not
mind blowing but it can be effective in certain circumstances.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS
I should make a couple of other points here. Firstly, not all damianas are the
same: source matters. Fresh strong damiana may work, whereas old or
substandard damiana won't have any real effect. Secondly, the effects seem to
vary by person, with some individuals claiming no effect at all.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
Bear in mind that many of the latter group will have been under the influence
of other materials, and that some will have procured bunk damiana, but there
are enough people stating this to suggest that it is true in some cases.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
Why post such a long report at this point in time?
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
One reason is the recent post regarding nicotine addiction: it struck me that a
damiana joint might prove to be an aid for people who are trying to quit
tobacco, or some other toxic substance.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
Another is that it doesn’t yet appear to be on the radar for the UK’s PSA
legislation, perhaps because of the difficulty in isolating what occurs
chemically or perhaps because it is so common. With this in mind, again, it
might be useful as a route to legally ease cravings for substances which are no
longer obtainable.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
One final point: although I haven't seen anything linking this to any serious
side effects, smoking combustible material always comes with a certain degree
of risk. Your lungs prefer fresh air, so anyone who samples it should take this
on board. Consider it to be a research herb and act accordingly.
\`\`\`
Following these initial smoking experiences, I found that damiana became more hit
and miss. The effects were much less pronounced on subsequent experiments.

I have experienced this with other materials too: it is hard if not impossible to
continue to reach the same intensity as that enjoyed on the first few occasions.
Sometimes a gap of months or years may reset the body and mind, and sometimes
not. In this case, on returning to damiana a year after these prior experiments the
effects were once again solid.

Overall, it is surprising that such an interesting herb remains relatively unknown
outside this niche. There is something to it, it is multi-faceted, and I didn’t note any
particularly strong negatives.

  "wikipedia": `# Turnera diffusa
*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turnera_diffusa*

Turnera diffusa, known as damiana, is a shrub native to southern Texas in the United States, Mexico, Central America, South America, and the Caribbean. It belongs to the family Passifloraceae.
Damiana is a relatively small, woody shrub that produces small, aromatic flowers. It blossoms in early to late summer, followed by fruits that taste similar to figs. The shrub is said to have a strong spice-like odor somewhat like chamomile, due to the aromatic compounds present in the plant.
Damiana is traditionally used in Mexican liqueurs and margaritas, historically featured in 19th-century patent medicines as an alleged aphrodisiac, and today is valued in herbal teas and smoking blends for its calming and mild psychoactive effects. It contains a complex mix of phytochemicals—including flavonoids like apigenin and acacetin, terpenoids, phenolics, cyanogenic glycosides, and others. It serves as a host plant for the Mexican fritillary (Euptoieta hegesia), a butterfly.
Many plants and seeds sold as T. diffusa are actually Turnera ulmifolia (“false damiana”), a different species with different chemical properties and uses, and this misidentification mostly happens in horticultural sales, not in herbal product markets.

## Uses

Damiana is an ingredient in a traditional Mexican liqueur, which is sometimes used in lieu of triple sec in margaritas. Mexican folklore claims that it was used in the "original" margarita. The damiana margarita is popular in the Los Cabos region of Mexico.
Damiana was included in several 19th-century patent medicines, such as Pemberton's French Wine Coca. The leaves were omitted from that product's non-alcoholic counterpart, Coca-Cola. In folklore, the plant was believed to be an aphrodisiac, hence its sometimes used binomial synonym, Turnera aphrodisiaca.
Beyond its historical use in drinks, Damiana continues to be a valued herb for its ability to induce relaxation and improve emotional well-being. It is commonly found in modern herbal teas and smoking blends, where it is used for its calming, mild psychoactive effects.

## Phytochemistry

Damiana contains damianin; tetraphyllin B; gonzalitosin I; arbutin; tricosan-2-one; acacetin; p-cymene; β-sitosterol; 1,8-cineole; apigenin; α-pinene; β-carotene; β-pinene; tannins; thymol; and hexacosanol. In total, 22 flavonoids, maltol glucoside, phenolics, seven cyanogenic glycosides, monoterpenoids, sesquiterpenoids, triterpenoids, the polyterpene ficaprenol-11, fatty acids, and caffeine have been found in the genus Turnera. As of 2006, damiana's constituents have not been identified for their effects attributed to the whole herb.

## Ecology

T. diffusa is a host plant for the Mexican fritillary (Euptoieta hegesia), a butterfly.

## Misidentification in commerce

Viable plant and seed material sold as T. diffusa from both private and commercial sources largely turns out to be misidentified Turnera ulmifolia (a.k.a. "False Damiana"), a closely related species. This widespread issue has been noted by the scientific community, and has created much confusion among both amateur and professional horticulturists alike. Mature stems of T. diffusa are woody, with small, grayed green leaves 13 to 16 mm long, 4.5 to 5.5 mm wide, obtuse at the apex, and strongly aromatic when crushed. T. ulmifolia is differentiated by herbaceous stems, larger blue-green leaves that are strongly dentate with a pointed apex, and only weakly aromatic. One scientific study however, demonstrated this confusion being mostly associated with horticultural commerce, and does not extend appreciably to commercial herbal products, most of which exhibit constituents that can be definitively traced to T. diffusa.
