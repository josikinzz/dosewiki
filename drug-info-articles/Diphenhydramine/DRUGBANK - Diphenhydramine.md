## Overview

### Description

This compound belongs to the class of organic compounds known as diphenylmethanes. These are compounds containing a diphenylmethane moiety, which consists of a methane wherein two hydrogen atoms are replaced by two phenyl groups.

### Background

Diphenhydramine - perhaps known most commonly as its brand name formulation Benadryl - is a first-generation H1 receptor antihistamine that is used extensively for the treatment of seasonal allergies, insect bites and stings, and rashes
9
,
10
,
11
,
17
. However, it also has antiemetic, antitussive, hypnotic, and antiparkinson properties
11
,
16
. As histamine receptors exist both peripherally and in the central nervous system, diphenhydramine has been shown to cause sedation due to its competitive antagonism of histamine H1 receptors within the central nervous system
9
,
10
,
11
,
17
,
5
. While its use in allergy therapy can sometimes fall out of favor due to its sedative effect, diphenhydramine has been repurposed for use within many non-prescription over-the-counter sleep aids and cough-and-cold medications that have been marketed for "night time" use
9
,
12
,
13
.
Diphenhydramine is also used in combination with
8-chlorotheophylline
as the anti-nausea drug
Dimenhydrinate
where it is utilized primarily for its antagonism of H1 histamine receptors within the vestibular system
4
.
Diphenhydramine has also been shown to be implicated in a number of neurotransmitter systems that affect behaviour including dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin, acetylcholine, and opioid
3
. As a result, diphenhydramine is being investigated for its anxiolytic and anti-depressant properties.

### Indication

Diphenhydramine is a first-generation histamine H1 receptor antagonist (H1 antihistamine) that is widely available as a non-prescription, over-the-counter (OTC) medication. As an OTC medication, diphenhydramine is typically formulated as tablets and creams indicated for use in treating sneezing, runny nose, itchy/watery eyes, itching of nose or throat, insomnia, pruritis, urticaria, insect bites/stings, allergic rashes, and nausea
9
,
10
,
11
,
17
,
5
.
Additionally, when the use of oral diphenhydramine is impractical, there are also prescription-only formulations such as diphenhydramine injection products that are effective in adults and pediatric patients (other than premature infants and neonates) for:
i) the amelioration of allergic reactions to blood or plasma, in anaphylaxis as an adjunct to epinephrine and other standard measures after acute allergic reaction symptoms have been controlled, and for other uncomplicated allergic conditions of the immediate type when oral therapy is impossible or contraindicated
16
;
ii) the active treatment of motion sickness
16
; and
iii) use in parkinsonism when oral therapy is impossible or contraindicated, as follows: parkinsonism in the elderly who are unable to tolerate more potent agents; mild cases of parkinsonism in other age groups, and in other cases of parkinsonism in combination with centrally acting anticholinergic agents
16
.

### Pharmacodynamics

Diphenhydramine has anti-histaminic (H1-receptor), anti-emetic, anti-vertigo and sedative and hypnotic properties
12
. The anti-histamine action occurs by blocking the spasmogenic and congestive effects of histamine by competing with histamine for H1 receptor sites on effector cells, preventing but not reversing responses mediated by histamine alone
12
. Such receptor sites may be found in the gut, uterus, large blood vessels, bronchial muscles, and elsewhere
12
. Anti-emetic action is by inhibition at the medullary chemoreceptor trigger zone
12
. Anti-vertigo action is by a central antimuscarinic effect on the vestibular apparatus and the integrative vomiting center and medullary chemoreceptor trigger zone of the midbrain
12
.

### Mechanism of Action

Histamine H1 receptor
Inverse agonist
Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M2
Antagonist

### Absorption

Diphenhydramine is quickly absorbed after oral administration with maximum activity occurring in approximately one hour
6
,
13
. The oral bioavailability of diphenhydramine has been documented in the range of 40% to 60%, and peak plasma concentration occurs about 2 to 3 hours after administration
6
,
13
.

### Metabolism

Diphenhydramine undergoes rapid and extensive first-pass metabolism
18
,
13
,
8
. In particular, two successive N-demethylations occur wherein diphenhydramine is demethylated to N-desmethyldiphenhydramine (the N-desmethyl metabolite) and then this metabolite is itself demethylated to N,N-didesmethyldiphenhydramine (the N,N-didesmethyl metabolite)
18
,
8
. Subsequently, acetyl metabolites like N-acetyl-N-desmethyldiphenhydramine are generated via the amine moiety of the N,N-didesmethyl metabolite
8
. Additionally, the N,N-didesmethyl metabolite also undergoes some oxidation to generate the diphenylmethoxyacetic acid metabolite as well
18
,
13
,
8
. The remaining percentage of a dose of administered diphenhydramine is excreted unchanged
18
,
13
,
8
. The metabolites are further conjugated with glycine and glutamine and excreted in urine
13
.
Moreover, studies have determined that a variety of cytochrome P450 isoenzymes are involved in the N-demethylation that characterizes the primary metabolic pathway of diphenhydramine, including CYP2D6, CYP1A2, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19
7
. In particular, CYP2D6 demonstrates higher affinity catalysis with the diphenhydramine substrate than the other isoenzymes identified
7
. Consequently, inducers or inhibitors of these such CYP enzymes may potentially affect the serum concentration and incidence and/or severity of adverse effects associated with exposure to diphenhydramine

### Half-life

The elimination half-life ranges from 2.4-9.3 hours in healthy adults
18
,
13
. The terminal elimination half-life is prolonged in liver cirrhosis
13
.

### Toxicity

Overdose is expected to result in effects similar to the adverse effects that are ordinarily associated with the use of diphenhydramine, including drowsiness, hyperpyrexia, and anticholinergic effects, among others
10
,
11
,
12
,
13
,
18
. Additional symptoms during overdose may include mydriasis, fever, flushing, agitation, tremor, dystonic reactions, hallucinations and ECG changes
13
. Large overdose may cause rhabdomyolysis, convulsions, delirium, toxic psychosis, arrhythmias, coma and cardiovascular collapse
13
. Moreover, with higher doses, and particularly in children, symptoms of CNS excitation including hallucinations and convulsions may appear; with massive doses, coma or cardiovascular collapse may follow
18
.
Although diphenhydramine has been in widespread use for many years without ill consequence, it is known to cross the placenta and has been detected in breast milk
18
. This medication should therefore only be used when the potential benefit of treatment to the mother exceeds any possible hazards to the developing fetus or suckling infant
18
.
Pharmacokinetic studies indicate no major differences in the distribution or elimination of diphenhydramine compared to younger adults
18
. Nevertheless, diphenhydramine should be used with caution in the elderly, who are more likely to experience adverse effects
13
. Avoid use in elderly patients with confusion
13
.
The results of a review on the use of diphenhydramine in renal failure suggest that in moderate to severe renal failure, the dose interval should be extended by a period dependent on Glomerular filtration rate (GFR)
18
.
After intravenous administration of 0.8 mg/kg diphenhydramine, a prolonged half-life was noted in patients with chronic liver disease which correlated with the severity of the disease
18
. However, the mean plasma clearance and apparent volume of distribution were not significantly affected
18
.
LD
50
=500 mg/kg (orally in rats). Considerable overdosage can lead to myocardial infarction (heart attack), serious ventricular dysrhythmias, coma and death.

### Mechanism of action

Diphenhydramine predominantly works via the antagonism of H1 (Histamine 1) receptors
9
,
10
,
11
,
17
,
5
. Such H1 receptors are located on respiratory smooth muscles, vascular endothelial cells, the gastrointestinal tract (GIT), cardiac tissue, immune cells, the uterus, and the central nervous system (CNS) neurons
9
,
10
,
11
,
17
,
5
. When the H1 receptor is stimulated in these tissues it produces a variety of actions including increased vascular permeability, promotion of vasodilation causing flushing, decreased atrioventricular (AV) node conduction time, stimulation of sensory nerves of airways producing coughing, smooth muscle contraction of bronchi and the GIT, and eosinophilic chemotaxis that promotes the allergic immune response
9
,
10
,
11
,
17
,
5
.
Ultimately, diphenhydramine functions as an inverse agonist at H1 receptors, and subsequently reverses effects of histamine on capillaries, reducing allergic reaction symptoms
9
,
10
,
11
,
17
,
5
. Moreover, since diphenhydramine is a first-generation antihistamine, it readily crosses the blood-brain barrier and inversely agonizes the H1 CNS receptors, resulting in drowsiness, and suppressing the medullary cough center
9
,
10
,
11
,
17
,
5
.
Furthermore, H1 receptors are similar to muscarinic receptors
9
,
10
,
11
,
17
,
5
. Consequently, diphenhydramine also acts as an antimuscarinic
9
,
10
,
11
,
17
,
5
. It does so by behaving as a competitive antagonist of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, resulting in its use as an antiparkinson medication
9
,
10
,
11
,
17
,
5
.
Lastly, diphenhydramine has also demonstrated activity as an intracellular sodium channel blocker, resulting in possible local anesthetic properties

### Volume of distribution

Diphenhydramine is widely distributed throughout the body, including the CNS
18
. Following a 50 mg oral dose of diphenhydramine, the volume of distribution is in the range of 3.3 - 6.8 l/kg
18
.

### Protein binding

Some prescribing information records the protein binding of diphenhydramine as approximately 78%
18
while others have suggested the medication is about 80 to 85%
13
bound to plasma proteins.

### Route of elimination

The metabolites of diphenhydramine are conjugated with glycine and glutamine and excreted in urine
12
,
13
. Only about 1% of a single dose is excreted unchanged in urine
12
,
13
. The medication is ultimately eliminated by the kidneys slowly, mainly as inactive metabolites
12
,
13
.

### Clearance

Values for plasma clearance of a 50 mg oral dose of diphenhydramine has been documented as lying in the range of 600-1300 ml/min

### General Function

Sodium-ion dependent, high affinity carnitine transporter. Involved in the active cellular uptake of carnitine. Transports one sodium ion with one molecule of carnitine (PubMed:10454528, PubMed:10525100, PubMed:10966938, PubMed:17509700, PubMed:20722056, PubMed:33124720). Also transports organic cations such as tetraethylammonium (TEA) without the involvement of sodium. Relative uptake activity ratio of carnitine to TEA is 11.3 (PubMed:10454528, PubMed:10525100, PubMed:10966938). In intestinal epithelia, transports the quorum-sensing pentapeptide CSF (competence and sporulation factor) from B.subtilis which induces cytoprotective heat shock proteins contributing to intestinal homeostasis (PubMed:18005709). May also contribute to regulate the transport of organic compounds in testis across the blood-testis-barrier (Probable)
