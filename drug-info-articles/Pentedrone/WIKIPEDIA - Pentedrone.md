Pentedrone (also known as α-methylaminovalerophenone) is a stimulant of the cathinone class that has been sold as a designer drug and has been found since 2010 as an ingredient in a number of "bath salt" mixes sold as legal highs.

## Pharmacology

Pentedrone acts as a norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI) without inducing monoamine release, a similar mechanism of action to methylphenidate. Its IC50Tooltip half-maximal inhibitory concentration values for inhibition of monoamine reuptake have been reported to be 610 nM for norepinephrine, 2,500 μM for dopamine, and 135,000 μM for serotonin. In rodents, pentedrone has been found to produce conditioned place preference (CPP), to be self-administered, and to dose-dependently stimulate locomotor activity. Hence, pentedrone shows psychostimulant-like and reinforcing effects in animals.

## Side effects

Pentedrone has been linked to at least one death where it was combined with α-PVP and caused heart failure.

## Detection

A forensic standard of pentedrone is available, and the compound has been posted on the Forendex website of potential drugs of abuse.
