LSD or Lysergic acid diethylamide is a semisynthetic drug of the lysergamide psychedelic family. It was first synthesized by Albert Hoffmann in 1938 from ergotamine which is a chemical derived from ergot, a grain fungus that typically grows on rye. In pure form it is a colourless, odourless, and mildly bitter solid.

LSD is typically delivered orally, usually in liquid form or on a substrate such as absorbent blotter paper which can be taken by simply chewing on it or swallowing.

It is one of the most potent drugs in the world, meaning that extremely small amounts are needed for the effects to show. A single dose of LSD may be between 100 and 500 micrograms - an amount which is roughly equal to one-tenth the mass of a grain of sand.

The mechanism that produces the psychedelic effects of LSD is a direct result from its action as a 5-HT2A serotonin receptor agonist in the brain, a mechanism of action shared by all other hallucinogenic tryptamines and phenethylamines.

The LSD experience contains a complex and wide array of effects which based on the predefined potential subjective effects index found [here](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effects_index), I will now begin to breakdown and describe.

**Physical Effects:**

The physical effects of LSD can be broken down into five components all of which progressively intensify proportional to dosage. These are described below and generally include:

- **Spontaneous tactile sensations** - The body high of LSD can be described as proportionally very intense in comparison to its accompanying visual and cognitive effects. It behaves as a euphoric, fast moving, sharp and location specific tingling sensation. For some it is manifested spontaneously at different unpredictable points throughout the trip, but for most it maintains a steady presence that rises with the onset and hits its limit once the peak has been reached. At moderate to high doses of LSD, this sensation will usually hit its highest level and become so overwhelming that people find themselves writhing on the floor in complete pleasure.
- **Stimulation** - In terms of its effects on the physical energy levels of the tripper, LSD is usually considered to be very energetic and stimulating without being forced. For example, when taken in any environment it will usually encourage physical activities such as running, walking, climbing or dancing. In comparison, other more commonly used psychedelics such as psilocin are generally sedating and relaxed.
- **Nausea** - Mild nausea is occasionally reported when consumed in moderate to high dosages and either passes instantly once the tripper has vomited or gradually fades by itself as the peak sets in.
- **Increased bodily control**
- **Enhancement of touch** - Feelings of enhanced tactile sensation are consistently present at moderate levels throughout most LSD trips. Once Level 7A visuals are reached, an intense sensation of suddenly becoming aware of and being able to feel every single nerve ending across a person’s entire body all at once is consistently present.

**Cognitive Effects:**

The cognitive effects of LSD can be broken down into ten components all of which progressively intensify proportional to dosage. In comparison to other psychedelics such as Psilocin, LSA and Ayahuasca, LSD is significantly more stimulating and fast paced in terms of the specific style of thought stream which it produces and contains a large number of potential effects.

The most prominent of these cognitive effects generally include:

- **Enhancement of current mind state**
- **Acceleration of thought**
- **Feelings of fascination, importance and awe**
- **Time distortion**
- **Introspection**
- **Deja-Vu**
- **Multiple thought streams**
- **Removal of cultural filter**
- **Conceptual thinking**
- **Ego suppression, loss and death**
- **Personality regression**
- **Thought loops**
- **Feelings of interdependent opposites**
- **Delusions**
- **States of unity and interconnectedness**

**Visual Effects:**

*Enhancements*

LSD presents a full and complete array of visual enhancements which generally include:

- **Increased visual acuity**
- **Enhancement of colours**
- **Enhanced pattern recognition**

*Distortions*

As for visual distortions and alterations, the effects experienced are detailed below:

- **Visual drifting** (*Melting, Breathing, Morphing and Flowing*) - In comparison to other psychedelics, this effect can be described as highly detailed yet cartoon in its appearance. The distortions are slow and smooth in motion and fleeting in their appearance.
- **Tracers**
- **After images**
- **Texture repetition**
- **Colour shifting**
- **Scenery slicing**

*Geometry*

The visual geometry that is present throughout this trip can be described as more similar in appearance to that of 2C-B and the 2C-x family as a whole than psilocin, LSA, or DMT. They can be comprehensively described as unstructured in their organization, algorithmic and digital in geometric style, intricate in complexity, large in size, fast and smooth in motion, multicoloured in scheme, bright and flat in colour, and sharp in their edges with extremely angular corners. At higher dosages they consistently result in states of Level 7A visual geometry.

*Hallucinatory States*

LSD is capable of producing a full range of low and high level hallucinatory states in a fashion that is significantly less consistent and reproducible than that of many other commonly used psychedelic. These effects include:

- **External hallucinations**
- **Internal hallucinations** - Although LSD is technically capable of producing of hallucinatory states in a fashion that is on par with psilocin or DMT in its vividness and intensity, in comparison, these effects are extremely rare and inconsistent. Whilst traditional psychedelics such as LSA, Ayahuasca and Mescaline will induce internal hallucinations near consistently at level 5 geometry and above, LSD will for most simply go straight into Level 7A visual geometry. This lack of consistently induced hallucinatory breakthroughs means that for most, LSD is simply not as deep of an experience as certain other psychedelics.

**Auditory Effects:**

The auditory effects of LSD are common in their occurrence and exhibit a full range of effects which commonly include:

- **Enhancements**
- **Distortions**
- **Hallucinations**

**Health Effects, Potential Addiction, and Tolerance:**

Similar to other psychedelic drugs, there are relatively few physical side effects associated with LSD acute exposure. Various studies have shown that in reasonable doses in a careful context, it presents no negative cognitive, psychiatric, or toxic physical consequences of any sort. The median lethal dose or dosage at which 50% of participants die (LD50) of LSD for human beings has never been reached in any setting and is predicted to be roughly 12,000 micrograms, based on studies involving rats whereas the active dosage is between 100 and 500 micrograms. This means that assuming a person has unusually potent tabs, each of which are 200 micrograms in strength each, they would have to consume at least 60 of them to reach a potentially lethal dosage. Keep in mind that your average tab of LSD found on the street is 100 micrograms or less in strength and anything stronger than this is particularly rare.

It’s important to note that LSD is non habit-forming and that the desire to use it can actually decrease with use, it is most often self-regulating. You also build an almost immediate tolerance to LSD after ingestion, preventing you from experiencing its full effects more often than every 4-7 days (unless you increase your dose significantly). 

**Legal Issues:**

- LSD is Schedule I in the United States according to the Controlled Substances Act of 1970.[112] This means LSD is illegal to manufacture, buy, possess, process, or distribute without a DEA license.
- In Canada, LSD is a controlled substance under Schedule III of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. Any person who is found in possession of LSD is entitled to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 years. Possession for purpose of trafficking is an indictable offense punishable by imprisonment for 10 years.
- In the United Kingdom, LSD is a class ‘A’ drug. This means possession of the drug without a license is punishable with 7 years imprisonment and/or an unlimited fine, and trafficking is punishable with life imprisonment and an unlimited fine.

The United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances (adopted in 1971) requires its parties to prohibit LSD. Hence, it is illegal in all parties to the convention, which include the United States, Australia, New Zealand, and most of Europe. However, enforcement of extant laws varies from country to country. Medical and scientific research with LSD in humans is permitted under the 1971 UN Convention.

If you want to try LSD you will have to find it through a street dealer or order it online through many various vendors which I can not legally ever mention the name of.

**Conclusion:**

LSD was the first psychedelic I ever tried and the first psychedelic I ever fully explored. It has benefited me and the people around me in so many personal ways through its deep states of introspection. It is amazingly therapeutic but eventually loses its novelty due to its complete lack of hallucinatory states and consistent unchanging visuals in a way that other psychedelics such as mushrooms simply do not.

LSD is a psychedelic that eventually loses its magic, becoming something which can be better enjoyed as an enhancer of recreational activities. Thanks to its long lasting, stimulating and euphoric nature, it is probably the best psychedelic for this purpose.
