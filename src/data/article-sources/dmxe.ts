Deoxymethoxetamine (3'-methyl-2-oxo-PCE, DMXE, 3D-MXE, Warm-K) is a recreational designer drug from the arylcyclohexylamine family, with dissociative effects. It is an analogue of methoxetamine where the 3-methoxy group has been replaced by methyl. It has been sold online since around October 2020, and was first definitively identified by a forensic laboratory in Denmark in February 2021.
