# Secobarbital
*Source: https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB00418*

## Overview

### Description

This compound belongs to the class of organic compounds known as barbituric acid derivatives. These are compounds containing a perhydropyrimidine ring substituted at C-2, -4 and -6 by oxo groups.

### Background

Secobarbital (marketed by Eli Lilly and Company under the brand names Seconal and Tuinal) is a barbiturate derivative drug with anaesthetic, anticonvulsant, sedative and hypnotic properties. It is commonly known as quinalbarbitone in the United Kingdom.

### Indication

For the Short-term treatment of intractable insomnia for patients habituated to barbiturates

### Pharmacodynamics

Secobarbital, a barbiturate, is used for the induction of anesthesia prior to the use of other general anesthetic agents and for induction of anesthesia for short surgical, diagnostic, or therapeutic procedures associated with minimal painful stimuli. Little analgesia is conferred by barbiturates; their use in the presence of pain may result in excitation.

### Mechanism of Action

Gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor subunit alpha-2
Potentiator
Gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor subunit alpha-3
Potentiator
Gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor subunit alpha-4

+ 3 more targets

### Toxicity

Symptoms of an overdose typically include sluggishness, incoordination, difficulty in thinking, slowness of speech, faulty judgment, drowsiness or coma, shallow breathing, staggering, and in severe cases coma and death.

### Drug Interactions

This information should not be interpreted without the help of a healthcare provider. If you believe you are experiencing an interaction, contact a healthcare provider immediately. The absence of an interaction does not necessarily mean no interactions exist.

1,2-Benzodiazepine
The risk or severity of CNS depression can be increased when Secobarbital is combined with 1,2-Benzodiazepine.
Abacavir
Secobarbital may decrease the excretion rate of Abacavir which could result in a higher serum level.
Abaloparatide
Secobarbital may increase the hypotensive activities of Abaloparatide.
Abemaciclib
The metabolism of Abemaciclib can be increased when combined with Secobarbital.
Acalabrutinib
The metabolism of Acalabrutinib can be increased when combined with Secobarbital.

### Food Interactions

Avoid alcohol. Taking with alcohol may cause additive CNS depression.
Take on an empty stomach. This may increase the rate of absorption.

### Associated Therapies

Anesthetic premedication therapy

### Mechanism of action

Secobarbital binds at a distinct binding site associated with a Cl
-
ionopore at the GABA
A
receptor, increasing the duration of time for which the Cl
-
ionopore is open. The post-synaptic inhibitory effect of GABA in the thalamus is, therefore, prolonged.

### Route of elimination

Barbiturates are metabolized primarily by the hepatic microsomal enzyme system, and the metabolic products are excreted in the urine and, less commonly, in the feces.

### General Function

A cytochrome P450 monooxygenase involved in the metabolism of various endogenous substrates, including fatty acids and steroids (PubMed:12865317, PubMed:15766564, PubMed:19965576, PubMed:21576599, PubMed:7574697, PubMed:9435160, PubMed:9866708). Mechanistically, uses molecular oxygen inserting one oxygen atom into a substrate, and reducing the second into a water molecule, with two electrons provided by NADPH via cytochrome P450 reductase (NADPH--hemoprotein reductase) (PubMed:12865317, PubMed:15766564, PubMed:19965576, PubMed:21576599, PubMed:7574697, PubMed:9435160, PubMed:9866708). Catalyzes the epoxidation of double bonds of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) (PubMed:15766564, PubMed:19965576, PubMed:7574697, PubMed:9866708). Catalyzes the hydroxylation of carbon-hydrogen bonds. Metabolizes cholesterol toward 25-hydroxycholesterol, a physiological regulator of cellular cholesterol homeostasis (PubMed:21576599). Exhibits low catalytic activity for the formation of catechol estrogens from 17beta-estradiol (E2) and estrone (E1), namely 2-hydroxy E1 and E2 (PubMed:12865317). Catalyzes bisallylic hydroxylation and hydroxylation with double-bond migration of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) (PubMed:9435160, PubMed:9866708). Also metabolizes plant monoterpenes such as limonene. Oxygenates (R)- and (S)-limonene to produce carveol and perillyl alcohol (PubMed:11950794). Contributes to the wide pharmacokinetics variability of the metabolism of drugs such as S-warfarin, diclofenac, phenytoin, tolbutamide and losartan (PubMed:25994031)
