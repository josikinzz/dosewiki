## Overview

### Description

This compound belongs to the class of organic compounds known as benzenesulfonamides. These are organic compounds containing a sulfonamide group that is S-linked to a benzene ring.

### Background

In eliciting its mechanism of action, sildenafil ultimately prevents or minimizes the breakdown of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) by inhibiting cGMP specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5)
11
,
12
,
13
,
14
,
15
,
16
,
8
,
9
. The result of doing so allows cGMP present in both the penis and pulmonary vasculature to elicit smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilation that subsequently facilitates relief in pulmonary arterial hypertension and the increased flow of blood into the spongy erectile tissue of the penis that consequently allows it to grow in size and become erect and rigid
11
,
12
,
13
,
14
,
15
,
16
,
8
,
9
.
Interestingly enough, it is precisely via this mechanism why sildenafil was at first researched as a potential treatment for angina - or chest pain associated with inadequate blood flow to the heart - before being serendipitously indicated for treating erectile dysfunction in the late 1980s
7
. Nevertheless, it is because of this mechanism that sildenafil is also indicated for treating pulmonary arterial hypertension but is also additionally notorious for interacting with various anti-anginal or anti-hypertensive agents to develop potentially rapid, excessive, and/or fatal hypotensive crises
4
,
5
,
6
.
Regardless, sildenafil, among a variety of other similar or related PDE5 inhibitors, has become a common and effective treatment for erectile dysfunction and since its formal approval for medical use in the public in 1998
7
, continues to see millions of prescriptions written for it internationally. Although the medication has historically been most popularly recognized as Pfizer's brand name Viagra, sildenafil is currently available generically and even as a non-prescription over the counter medication in some countries
10
.

### Indication

Sildenafil is a phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) inhibitor that is predominantly employed for two primary indications:
(1) the treatment of erectile dysfunction
5
,
8
,
12
,
13
,
16
; and
(2) treatment of pulmonary hypertension, where:
a) the US FDA specifically indicates sildenafil for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) (WHO Group I) in adults to improve exercise ability and delay clinical worsening
11
. The delay in clinical worsening was demonstrated when sildenafil was added to background epoprostenol therapy
11
. Studies establishing effectiveness were short-term (12 to 16 weeks), and included predominately patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) Functional Class II-III symptoms and idiopathic etiology (71%) or associated with connective tissue disease (CTD) (25%)
11
;
b) the Canadian product monograph specifically indicates sildenafil for the treatment of primary pulmonary arterial hypertension (PPH) or pulmonary hypertension secondary to connective tissue disease (CTD) in adult patients with WHO functional class II or III who have not responded to conventional therapy
14
. In addition, improvement in exercise ability and delay in clinical worsening was demonstrated in adult patients who were already stabilized on background epoprostenol therapy
14
; and
c) the EMA product information specifically indicates sildenafil for the treatment of adult patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension classified as WHO functional class II and III, to improve exercise capacity
15
. Efficacy has been shown in primary pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary hypertension associated with connective tissue disease
15
. The EMA label also indicates sildenafil for the treatment of pediatric patients aged 1 year to 17 years old with pulmonary arterial hypertension
15
. Efficacy in terms of improvement of exercise capacity or pulmonary hemodynamics has been shown in primary pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary hypertension associated with congenital heart disease
15
.

### Pharmacodynamics

In vitro studies have shown that sildenafil is selective for phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5)
11
,
12
,
13
,
14
,
15
,
16
,
8
,
9
. Its effect is more potent on PDE5 than on other known phosphodiesterases
11
,
12
,
13
,
14
,
15
,
16
,
8
,
9
. In particular, there is a 10-times selectivity over PDE6 which is involved in the phototransduction pathway in the retina
11
,
12
,
13
,
14
,
15
,
16
,
8
,
9
. There is an 80-times selectivity over PDE1, and over 700-times over PDE 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11
11
,
12
,
13
,
14
,
15
,
16
,
8
,
9
. And finally, sildenafil has greater than 4,000-times selectivity for PDE5 over PDE3, the cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase isoform involved in the control of cardiac contractility
11
,
12
,
13
,
14
,
15
,
16
,
8
,
9
.
In eight double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover studies of patients with either organic or psychogenic erectile dysfunction, sexual stimulation resulted in improved erections, as assessed by an objective measurement of hardness and duration of erections (via the use of RigiScan®), after sildenafil administration compared with placebo
11
,
12
,
13
,
14
,
15
,
16
,
8
,
9
. Most studies assessed the efficacy of sildenafil approximately 60 minutes post-dose
11
,
12
,
13
,
14
,
15
,
16
,
8
,
9
. The erectile response, as assessed by RigiScan®, generally increased with increasing sildenafil dose and plasma concentration
11
,
12
,
13
,
14
,
15
,
16
,
8
,
9
. The time course of effect was examined in one study, showing an effect for up to 4 hours but the response was diminished compared to 2 hours
11
,
12
,
13
,
14
,
15
,
16
,
8
,
9
.
Sildenafil causes mild and transient decreases in systemic blood pressure which, in the majority of cases, do not translate into clinical effects
11
,
12
,
13
,
14
,
15
,
16
,
8
,
9
. After chronic dosing of 80 mg, three times a day to patients with systemic hypertension the mean change from baseline in systolic and diastolic blood pressure was a decrease of 9.4 mmHg and 9.1 mmHg respectively
11
,
12
,
13
,
14
,
15
,
16
,
8
,
9
. After chronic dosing of 80 mg, three times a day to patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension lesser effects in blood pressure reduction were observed (a reduction in both systolic and diastolic pressure of 2 mmHg)
11
,
12
,
13
,
14
,
15
,
16
,
8
,
9
. At the recommended dose of 20 mg three times a day no reductions in systolic or diastolic pressure were seen
11
,
12
,
13
,
14
,
15
,
16
,
8
,
9
.
Single oral doses of sildenafil up to 100 mg in healthy volunteers produced no clinically relevant effects on ECG
11
,
12
,
13
,
14
,
15
,
16
,
8
,
9
. After chronic dosing of 80 mg three times a day to patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension no clinically relevant effects on the ECG were reported either
11
,
12
,
13
,
14
,
15
,
16
,
8
,
9
.
In a study of the hemodynamic effects of a single oral 100 mg dose of sildenafil in 14 patients with severe coronary artery disease (CAD) (> 70 % stenosis of at least one coronary artery), the mean resting systolic and diastolic blood pressures decreased by 7 % and 6 % respectively compared to baseline
11
,
12
,
13
,
14
,
15
,
16
,
8
,
9
. Mean pulmonary systolic blood pressure decreased by 9%
11
,
12
,
13
,
14
,
15
,
16
,
8
,
9
. Sildenafil showed no effect on cardiac output and did not impair blood flow through the stenosed coronary arteries
11
,
12
,
13
,
14
,
15
,
16
,
8
,
9
.
Mild and transient differences in color discrimination (blue/green) were detected in some subjects using the Farnsworth-Munsell 100 hue test at 1 hour following a 100 mg dose, with no effects evident after 2 hours post-dose
11
,
12
,
13
,
14
,
15
,
16
,
8
,
9
. The postulated mechanism for this change in color discrimination is related to inhibition of PDE6, which is involved in the phototransduction cascade of the retina
11
,
12
,
13
,
14
,
15
,
16
,
8
,
9
. Sildenafil has no effect on visual acuity or contrast sensitivity. In a small size placebo-controlled study of patients with documented early age-related macular degeneration (n = 9), sildenafil (single dose, 100 mg) demonstrated no significant changes in visual tests conducted (which included visual acuity, Amsler grid, color discrimination simulated traffic light, and the Humphrey perimeter and photostress test)
11
,
12
,
13
,
14
,
15
,
16
,

,
9
.

### Mechanism of Action

cGMP-specific 3',5'-cyclic phosphodiesterase
Inhibitor

### Absorption

Sildenafil is known to be quickly absorbed, with maximum plasma concentrations being observed within 30-120 minutes (with a median of 60 minutes) of oral administration in a fasting patient
11
,
12
,
13
,
14
,
15
,
16
,
8
,
9
. Moreover, the mean absolute bioavailability observed for sildenafil is about 41% (from a range of 25-63%)
11
,
12
,
13
,
14
,
15
,
16
,
8
,
9
. In particular, after oral three times a day dosing of sildenafil, the AUC and Cmax increase in proportion with dose over the recommended dosage range of 25-100 mg
11
,
12
,
13
,
14
,
15
,
16
,
8
,
9
.
When used in pulmonary arterial hypertension patients, however, the oral bioavailability of sildenafil after a dosing regimen of 80 mg three times a day, was on average 43% greater than compared to the lower doses
11
,
12
,
13
,
14
,
15
,
16
,
8
,
9
.
Finally, if sildenafil is administered orally with food, the rate of absorption is observed to be decreased with a mean delay in Tmax of about 60 minutes and a mean decrease in Cmax of approximately 29%
11
,
12
,
13
,
14
,
15
,
16
,
8
,
9
. Regardless, the extent of absorption is not observed to be significantly affected as the recorded AUC decreased by only about 11 %
11
,
12
,
13
,
14
,
15
,
16
,
8
,
9
.

### Metabolism

The metabolism of sildenafil is facilitated primarily by the CYP3A4 hepatic microsomal isoenzymes and to a minor extent, via the CYP2C9 hepatic isoenzymes
6
,
11
,
12
,
13
,
14
,
15
,
16
,
8
,
9
. The predominant circulating metabolite results from the N-demethylation of sildenafil
6
,
11
,
12
,
13
,
14
,
15
,
16
,
8
,
9
. This particular resultant metabolite possesses a phosphodiesterase selectivity that is similar to the parent sildenafil molecule and a corresponding in vitro potency for PDE5 that is approximately 50% that of the parent drug
6
,
11
,
12
,
13
,
14
,
15
,
16
,
8
,
9
. Moreover, plasma concentrations of the metabolite are about 40% of those recorded for sildenafil, a percentage that accounts for about 20% of sildenafil’s pharmacologic effects
6
,
11
,
12
,
13
,
14
,
15
,
16
,
8
,
9
. This primary N-desmethyl metabolite of sildenafil also undergoes further metabolism, with a terminal half-life of about 4 hours
6
,
11
,
12
,
13
,
14
,
15
,
16
,
8
,
9
.
In patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension, plasma concentrations of the primary N-desmethyl metabolite are about 72% those of the original parent sildenafil molecule after a regimen of 20 mg three times a day - which is consequently responsible for about a 36% contribution to sildenafil’s overall pharmacological effects

### Half-life

The terminal phase half-life observed for sildenafil is approximately 3 to 5 hours

.

### Toxicity

In single-dose volunteer studies of doses up to 800 mg, adverse reactions were similar to those seen at lower doses, but the incidence rates and severities were increased
11
,
12
,
13
,
14
,
15
,
16
,
8
,
9
. Doses of 200 mg did not result in increased efficacy but the incidence of adverse reaction (headache, flushing, dizziness, dyspepsia, nasal congestion, altered vision) was increased
11
,
12
,
13
,
14
,
15
,
16
,
8
,
9
.
Due to the lack of data on the effect of sildenafil indicated for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in pregnant women, sildenafil is not recommended for women of childbearing potential unless also using appropriate contraceptive measures
11
,
14
,
15
,
9
.
The safety and efficacy of sildenafil indicated for treating PAH in a woman during labor and delivery have not been studied
11
,
14
,
15
,
9
. Caution should ultimately be exercised when sildenafil is administered to nursing women as it is not known if sildenafil or its metabolites are excreted in human breast milk
11
,
14
,
15
,
9
.
The safety and efficacy of sildenafil for the treatment of PAH in children below 1 year of age has not been established as no data is available
15
.
Clinical experience with the elderly population in the use of sildenafil for the treatment of PAH has been varied. Some reports suggest that there are no identified differences in responses between elderly and younger patients
11
while others have documented that clinical efficacy as measured by 6-minute walk distance could be less in elderly patients
9
. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy
11
.
Conversely, when sildenafil was used to treat erectile dysfunction in healthy elderly volunteers (65 years or over), a reduced clearance of sildenafil was observed
12
,
8
. This reduction resulted in about 90% higher plasma concentrations of sildenafil and the active N-desmethyl metabolite compared to those seen in healthy younger volunteers (18-45 years)
12
,
8
. Due to age-differences in plasma protein binding, the corresponding increase in free sildenafil plasma concentration was approximately 40%
12
,
8
.
Sildenafil was not carcinogenic when administered to rats for 24 months at a dose resulting in total systemic drug exposure (AUCs) for unbound sildenafil and its major metabolite of 29- and 42- times, for male and female rats, respectively, the exposures observed in human males given the Maximum Recommended Human Dose (MRHD) of 100 mg
11
,
12
,
13
,
14
,
15
,
16
,
8
,
9
. Sildenafil was not carcinogenic when administered to mice for 18-21 months at dosages up to the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of 10 mg/kg/day, approximately 0.6 times the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis
11
,
12
,
13
,
14
,
15
,
16
,
8
,
9
.
Sildenafil was negative in in vitro bacterial and Chinese hamster ovary cell assays to detect mutagenicity, and in vitro human lymphocytes and in vivo mouse micronucleus assays to detect clastogenicity
11
,
12
,
13
,
14
,
15
,
16
,
8
,
9
.
There was no impairment of fertility in rats given sildenafil up to 60 mg/kg/day for 36 days to females and 102 days to males, a dose producing an AUC value of more than 25 times the human male AUC

### Mechanism of action

Sildenafil is an oral therapy for erectile dysfunction
5
,
12
,
13
,
16
,
8
. In the natural setting, i.e. with sexual stimulation, it restores impaired erectile function by increasing blood flow to the penis
5
,
12
,
13
,
16
,
8
.
The physiological mechanism responsible for the erection of the penis involves the release of nitric oxide (NO) in the corpus cavernosum during sexual stimulation
5
,
12
,
13
,
16
,
8
. Nitric oxide then activates the enzyme guanylate cyclase, which results in increased levels of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), producing smooth muscle relaxation in the corpus cavernosum and allowing inflow of blood
5
,
12
,
13
,
16
,
8
.
Sildenafil is a potent and selective inhibitor of cGMP specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) in the corpus cavernosum, where PDE5 is responsible for degradation of cGMP
5
,
12
,
13
,
16
,
8
. Sildenafil has a peripheral site of action on erections
5
,
12
,
13
,
16
,
8
. Sildenafil has no direct relaxant effect on isolated human corpus cavernosum but potently enhances the relaxant effect of NO on this tissue
5
,
12
,
13
,
16
,
8
. When the NO/cGMP pathway is activated, as occurs with sexual stimulation, inhibition of PDE5 by sildenafil results in increased corpus cavernosum levels of cGMP
5
,
12
,
13
,
16
,
8
. Therefore sexual stimulation is required in order for sildenafil to produce its intended beneficial pharmacological effects
5
,
12
,
13
,
16
,
8
.
Moreover, apart from the presence of PDE5 in the corpus cavernosum of the penis, PDE5 is also present in the pulmonary vasculature
4
,
11
,
14
,
15
,
9
. Sildenafil, therefore, increases cGMP within pulmonary vascular smooth muscle cells resulting in relaxation
4
,
11
,
14
,
15
,
9
. In patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension, this can lead to vasodilation of the pulmonary vascular bed and, to a lesser degree, vasodilatation in the systemic circulation

,

## Effects
Restoration of erectile function by increasing blood flow to the penis, lowering blood pressure.

## Risks

### Short-term Risks
Do not use Viagra® if you have low blood pressure. Do not take Viagra with blood pressure lowering substances. The combination with poppers or other nitrites (often present in medicines against angina pectoris, e.g. glycerine) is life-threatening, as severe blood pressure reductions can occur! Viagra combined with cocaine or other performance-enhancing substances leads to high cardiovascular stress, which can result in overheating or a heart attack.

  "wikipedia": `# Sildenafil
*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sildenafil*

Sildenafil, sold under the brand name Viagra among others, is a medication used to treat erectile dysfunction and pulmonary arterial hypertension. It is also sometimes used off-label for the treatment of certain symptoms in secondary Raynaud's phenomenon. It is unclear if it is effective for treating sexual dysfunction in females. It can be taken orally (swallowed by mouth), intravenously (injection into a vein), or through the sublingual route (dissolved under the tongue). Onset when taken orally is typically within twenty minutes and lasts for about two hours.
Common side effects include headaches, heartburn, and flushed skin. Caution is advised in those with cardiovascular disease. Rare but serious side effects include vision problems, hearing loss, and prolonged erection (priapism) that can lead to damage to the penis. Sildenafil should not be taken by people on nitric oxide donors such as nitroglycerin, as this may result in a serious drop in blood pressure.
Sildenafil acts by blocking phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5), an enzyme that promotes breakdown of cGMP, which regulates blood flow in the penis. It requires sexual arousal to work, and does not by itself cause or increase sexual arousal. It also results in dilation of the blood vessels in the lungs.
Pfizer originally discovered the medication in 1989 while looking for a treatment for angina. It was approved for medical use in the United States and in the European Union in 1998. In 2023, it was the 151st most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 3 million prescriptions. It is available as a generic medication. In the United Kingdom, it is available as a pharmacy medicine.

## Medical uses

### Erectile dysfunction

The primary indication of sildenafil is treatment of erectile dysfunction (inability to sustain a satisfactory erection to complete sexual intercourse). Its use is now one of the standard treatments for erectile dysfunction, including for males with diabetes mellitus.

#### Antidepressant-associated erectile dysfunction

Tentative evidence suggests that sildenafil may help males who experience antidepressant-induced erectile dysfunction.

### Pulmonary hypertension

While sildenafil improves some markers of disease in people with pulmonary arterial hypertension, it does not appear to affect the risk of death or serious side effects.

### Raynaud's phenomenon

Sildenafil and other PDE5 inhibitors are used off-label to alleviate vasospasm and treat severe ischemia and ulcers in fingers and toes for people with secondary Raynaud's phenomenon; these drugs have moderate efficacy for reducing the frequency and duration of vasospastic episodes. As of 2016, their role more generally in Raynaud's was not clear.

### Altitude sickness

Sildenafil has shown some potential for improving exercise performance at high altitudes. However, its overall efficacy is not clear.

#### High-altitude pulmonary edema

Sildenafil has been studied for high-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE), but its use is currently not recommended for that indication.

## Adverse effects

In clinical trials, the most common adverse effects of sildenafil use included headache, flushing, indigestion, nasal congestion, and impaired vision, including photophobia and blurred vision. Some sildenafil users have complained of seeing everything tinted blue (cyanopsia). This cyanopsia can be explained because sildenafil, while selective for PDE5, does have some affinity for PDE6, which is the phosphodiesterase found in the retina. Patients thus taking the drug may experience colorvision abnormalities. Some complained of blurriness and loss of peripheral vision. In July 2005, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) updated labeling for tadalafil (Cialis), vardenafil (Levitra), and sildenafil (Viagra) to reflect a small number of post-marketing reports of sudden vision loss, while acknowledging that "...it is not possible to determine whether these oral medicines for erectile dysfunction were the cause of the loss of eyesight or whether the problem is related to other factors such as high blood pressure or diabetes, or to a combination of these problems." A careful review of pooled data from clinical trials containing well documented information about the dose and duration of exposure to the drug for a large number of patients, yields no evidence for an increased risk of non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy or other adverse ocular events associated with PDE5 inhibitor use.
Rare but serious adverse effects found through postmarketing surveillance include prolonged erections, severe low blood pressure, myocardial infarction (heart attack), ventricular arrhythmias, stroke, increased intraocular pressure, and sudden hearing loss. In October 2007, the FDA announced that the labeling for all PDE5 inhibitors, including sildenafil, required a more prominent warning of the potential risk of sudden hearing loss.

### Interactions

Care should be exercised by people who are also taking protease inhibitors for the treatment of HIV infection. Protease inhibitors inhibit the metabolism of sildenafil, effectively multiplying the plasma levels of sildenafil, increasing the incidence and severity of side effects. Those using protease inhibitors are recommended to limit their use of sildenafil to no more than one 25 mg dose every 48 hours. Other drugs that interfere with the metabolism of sildenafil include erythromycin and cimetidine, both of which can also lead to prolonged plasma half-life levels.
The use of sildenafil and an α1 blocker (typically prescribed for hypertension or for urologic conditions, such as benign prostatic hypertrophy) at the same time may lead to low blood pressure, but this effect does not occur if they are taken at least 4 hours apart.

### Contraindications

Contraindications include:

Concomitant use of nitric oxide donors, organic nitrites and nitrates, such as:
nitroglycerin
isosorbide mononitrate
isosorbide dinitrate
sodium nitroprusside
alkyl nitrites (commonly known as "poppers")
Concomitant use of soluble guanylyl cyclase stimulators, such as riociguat
Known hypersensitivity to sildenafil
Sildenafil should not be used if sexual activity is inadvisable due to underlying cardiovascular risk factors.

## Non-medical use

### Recreational use

Sildenafil's popularity with young adults has increased over the years. Sildenafil's brand name, Viagra, is widely recognized in popular culture, and the drug's association with treating erectile dysfunction has led to its recreational use. The reasons behind such use include the belief that the drug increases libido, improves sexual performance, or permanently increases penis size. Studies on the effects of sildenafil when used recreationally are limited, but suggest it has little effect when used by those who do not have erectile dysfunction. In one study, a 25 mg dose was shown to cause no significant change in erectile quality, but did reduce the postejaculatory refractory time. This study also noted a significant placebo effect in the control group.
Unprescribed recreational use of sildenafil and other PDE5 inhibitors is noted as particularly high among users of illegal drugs. Sildenafil is sometimes used to counteract the effects of other substances, often illicit. Some users mix it with methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ecstasy), other stimulants, or opiates in an attempt to compensate for the common side effect of erectile dysfunction, a combination known as "sextasy", "rockin' and rollin'", "hammerheading", or "trail mix". Mixing it with amyl nitrite, another vasodilator, is particularly dangerous and potentially fatal.

### Jet lag research

The 2007 Ig Nobel Prize in aviation went to Patricia V. Agostino, Santiago A. Plano, and Diego A. Golombek of Universidad Nacional de Quilmes, Argentina, for their discovery that sildenafil helps treat jet lag recovery in hamsters.

### Sports

Professional athletes have been documented using sildenafil, believing the opening of their blood vessels will enrich their muscles. In turn, they believe it will enhance their performances.

### Analogs

Acetildenafil and other synthetic structural analogs of sildenafil which are PDE5 inhibitors have been found as adulterants in a number of "herbal" aphrodisiac products sold over-the-counter. These analogs have not undergone any of the rigorous testing that drugs like sildenafil have passed, and thus have unknown side-effect profiles. Some attempts have been made to ban these drugs, but progress has been slow so far, as, even in those jurisdictions that have laws targeting designer drugs, the laws are drafted to ban analogs of illegal drugs of abuse, rather than analogs of prescription medicines. However, at least one court case has resulted in a product being taken off the market.
The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has banned numerous products claiming to be Eurycoma longifolia that, in fact, contain only analogs of sildenafil. Sellers of such fake herbals typically respond by just changing the names of their products.

## Detection in biological fluids

Sildenafil and/or N-desmethylsildenafil, its major active metabolite, may be quantified in plasma, serum, or whole blood to assess pharmacokinetic status in those receiving the drug therapeutically, to confirm the diagnosis in potential poisoning victims, or to assist in the forensic investigation in a case of fatal overdose.

## Mechanism of action

Sildenafil protects cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) from degradation by cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) in the corpus cavernosum. Nitric oxide (NO) in the corpus cavernosum of the penis binds to guanylate cyclase receptors, which results in increased levels of cGMP, leading to smooth muscle relaxation (vasodilation) of the intimal cushions of the helicine arteries. This smooth muscle relaxation leads to vasodilation and increased inflow of blood into the spongy tissue of the penis, causing an erection. Robert F. Furchgott, Ferid Murad, and Louis Ignarro won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1998 for their independent study of the metabolic pathway of nitric oxide in smooth muscle vasodilation.
The molecular mechanism of smooth muscle relaxation involves the enzyme CGMP-dependent protein kinase, also known as PKG. This kinase is activated by cGMP and it phosphorylates multiple targets in the smooth muscle cells, namely myosin light chain phosphatase, RhoA, IP3 receptor, phospholipase C, and others. Overall, this results in a decrease in intracellular calcium and desensitizing proteins to the effects of calcium, engendering smooth muscle relaxation.
Sildenafil is a potent and selective inhibitor of cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5), which is responsible for degradation of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum. The molecular structure of sildenafil is similar to that of cGMP and acts as a competitive binding agent of PDE5 in the corpus cavernosum, resulting in more cGMP and increased penile response to sexual stimulation. Without sexual stimulation, and therefore lack of activation of the NO/cGMP system, sildenafil should not cause an erection. Other drugs that operate by the same mechanism include tadalafil (Cialis) and vardenafil (Levitra).
Sildenafil is broken down in the liver by hepatic metabolism using cytochrome p450 enzymes, mainly CYP450 3A4 (major route), but also by CYP2C9 (minor route) hepatic isoenzymes. The major product of metabolisation by these enzymes is N-desmethylated sildenafil, which is metabolised further. This metabolite also has an affinity for the PDE receptors, about 40% of that of sildenafil. Thus, the metabolite is responsible for about 20% of sildenafil's action. Sildenafil is excreted as metabolites predominantly in the feces (about 80% of administered oral dose) and to a lesser extent in the urine (around 13% of the administered oral dose). If taken with a high-fat meal, absorption is reduced; the time taken to reach the maximum plasma concentration increases by around one hour, and the maximum concentration itself is decreased by nearly one-third.

## Route of administration

When taken orally, sildenafil for erectile dysfunction results in an average time to onset of erections of 27 minutes (ranging from 12 to 70 minutes).
Sublingual use of sildenafil for erectile dysfunction results in an average onset of action of 15 minutes and lasting for an average of 40 minutes.

## Chemical synthesis

The preparation steps for synthesis of sildenafil are:

Methylation of 3-propylpyrazole-5-carboxylic acid ethyl ester with hot dimethyl sulfate
Hydrolysis with aqueous sodium hydroxide (NaOH) to free acid
Nitration with oleum/fuming nitric acid
Carboxamide formation with refluxing thionyl chloride/NH4OH
Reduction of nitro group to amino group
Acylation with 2-ethoxybenzoyl chloride
Cyclization
Sulfonation to the chlorosulfonyl derivative
Condensation with 1-methylpiperazine.

## History

Sildenafil (compound UK-92,480) was synthesized by a group of pharmaceutical chemists led by Simon Campbell working at Pfizer's Sandwich, Kent, research facility in England. It was initially studied for use in hypertension (high blood pressure) and angina pectoris (a symptom of ischaemic heart disease). The first clinical trials were conducted in Morriston Hospital in Swansea. Phase I clinical trials under the direction of Ian Osterloh suggested the drug had little effect on angina, but it could induce marked penile erections. Pfizer therefore decided to market it for erectile dysfunction, rather than for angina; this decision became an often-cited example of drug repositioning. The drug was patented in 1996, approved for use in erectile dysfunction by the FDA on 27 March 1998, becoming the first oral treatment approved to treat erectile dysfunction in the United States, and offered for sale in the United States later that year. It soon became a great success: annual sales of Viagra peaked in 2008 at US\$1.934 billion.

## Society and culture

### Marketing and sales

In the US, even though sildenafil is available only by prescription from a doctor, it was advertised directly to consumers on TV (famously being endorsed by former United States Senator Bob Dole and football star Pelé). Numerous sites on the Internet offer Viagra for sale after an "online consultation", often a simple web questionnaire.
Viagra and other products for sexual dysfunction, termed sexuopharmaceuticals, proliferated new types of specialised marketing for such products. Viagra and similar prescription pharmaceuticals were promoted by images in media to the extent of becoming a cultural icon, at the time a relatively new phenomenon known to be permitted only in the United States and New Zealand and which is believed to have significantly contributed to norms regarding male sexuality. One author notes that although the effect of Viagra is only limited to penile blood vessels, advertisements routinely use imagery of couples hugging, smiling and dancing, with the author claiming that pharmaceutical companies were deceptive in the use of such advertisements.
In 2000, Viagra sales accounted for 92% of the global market for prescribed erectile dysfunction pills. By 2007, Viagra's global share had plunged to about 50% due to several factors, including the entry of Cialis and Levitra, along with several counterfeits and clones, and reports of vision loss in people taking PDE5 inhibitors. In 2008, the FDA forced Pfizer to remove Viva Cruiser, an advergame for Viagra, from appearing on Forbes, after the game failed to disclose risk information about the drug.
In February 2007, it was announced that Boots, the UK pharmacy chain, would try over-the-counter sales of Viagra in stores in Manchester, England. Males between the ages of 30 and 65 would be eligible to buy four tablets after a consultation with a pharmacist. In 2017, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) enacted legislation that expanded this nationwide, allowing a particular branded formulation of Sildenafil, Viagra Connect (50 mg), to be sold over the counter and without a prescription throughout the UK from early 2018. While the sale remains subject to a consultation with a pharmacist, the other restrictions from the trial have been removed, allowing customers over the age of 18 to purchase an unlimited number of pills.
In May 2013, Pfizer, which manufactures Viagra, told the Associated Press they will begin selling the drug directly to people on its website.
Pfizer's patents on Viagra expired outside the US in 2012; in the US they were set to expire, but Pfizer settled litigation with each of Mylan and Teva which agreed that both companies could introduce generics in the US in December 2017. In December 2017, Pfizer released its own generic version of Viagra.
As of 2018, the US Food and Drug Administration has approved fifteen drug manufacturers to market generic sildenafil in the United States. Seven of these companies are based in India.
The patent for Pfizer's Viagra sildenafil to treat erectile dysfunction expired in April 2020.

### Counterfeits

Counterfeit Viagra, despite generally being cheaper, can contain harmful substances or substances that affect how Viagra works, such as blue printer ink, amphetamines, metronidazole, boric acid, and rat poison.
Viagra is one of the world's most counterfeited medicines. According to a 2012 Pfizer study, around 80% of sites claiming to sell Viagra were selling counterfeits.
An October 2023 release stated that erectile dysfunction medicines were the most seized drugs by the Interpol accounting for 22% of seizures. International networks may be active.

### Regional issues

#### United States

In 1992, Pfizer filed a patent covering the substance sildenafil and its use to treat cardiovascular diseases. This would be marketed as Revatio. The patent was published in 1993 and expired in 2012. The patent on Revatio (indicated for pulmonary arterial hypertension rather than erectile dysfunction) expired in late 2012. Generic versions of this low-dose form of sildenafil have been available in the US from a number of manufacturers, including Greenstone, Mylan, and Watson, since early 2013. Health care providers may prescribe generic sildenafil for erectile dysfunction. For a time, the generic was not available in the same dosages as branded Viagra, so using dosages typically required for treating ED required patients to take multiple pills.
In 1994, Pfizer filed a patent covering the use of sildenafil to treat erectile dysfunction. This would be marketed as Viagra. This patent was published in 2002 and expired in 2019. Teva sued to have the latter patent invalidated, but Pfizer prevailed in an August 2011 federal district court case. An agreement with Pfizer allowed Teva to begin to provide the generic drug in December 2017.
In the United States, Pfizer received two patents for sildenafil: one for its indication to treat cardiovascular disease (marketed as Revatio) and another for its indication to treat erectile dysfunction (marketed as Viagra). The substance is the same under both brand names.
Sildenafil is available as a generic drug in the United States, labeled for pulmonary arterial hypertension, and to treat erectile dysfunction, as the patent expired in April 2020.
In the US, Revatio and Viagra are marketed by Viatris after Upjohn was spun off from Pfizer.

#### Brazil

Pfizer's patent on sildenafil citrate expired in Brazil in 2010.

#### Canada

In Canada, Pfizer's patent 2,324,324 for Revatio (sildenafil used to treat pulmonary hypertension) was found invalid by the Federal Court in June 2010, on an application by Ratiopharm Inc.
On 8 November 2012, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that Pfizer's patent 2,163,446 on Viagra was invalid from the beginning because the company did not provide full disclosure in its application. The decision, Teva Canada Ltd. v. Pfizer Canada Inc., pointed to section 27(3)(b) of The Patent Act which requires that disclosure must include sufficient information "to enable any person skilled in the art or science to which it pertains" to produce it. It added further: "As a matter of policy and sound statutory interpretation, patentees cannot be allowed to 'game' the system in this way. This, in my view, is the key issue in this appeal."
Teva Canada launched Novo-Sildenafil, a generic version of Viagra, on the day the Supreme Court of Canada released its decision. To remain competitive, Pfizer then reduced the price of Viagra in Canada. However, on 9 November 2012, Pfizer filed a motion for a re-hearing of the appeal in the Supreme Court of Canada, on the grounds that the court accidentally exceeded its jurisdiction by voiding the patent. Finally, on 22 April 2013, the Supreme Court of Canada invalidated Pfizer's patent altogether.

#### China

Manufacture and sale of sildenafil citrate drugs is common in China, where Pfizer's patent claim is not widely enforced.

#### Egypt

Egypt approved Viagra for sale in 2002, but soon afterwards allowed local companies to produce generic versions of the drug, citing the interests of poor people who would not be able to afford Pfizer's price.

#### European Union

In June 2013 Pfizer's patent on sildenafil citrate expired in some member countries of the European Union, including Austria, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, The Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland. A UK patent held by Pfizer on the use of PDE5 inhibitors (see below) as treatment of impotence was invalidated in 2000 because of obviousness; this decision was upheld on appeal in 2002.

#### India

Manufacture and sale of sildenafil citrate drugs known as "generic Viagra" is common in India, where Pfizer's patent claim does not apply. Brand names include Kamagra (Ajanta Pharma), Silagra (Cipla), Edegra (Sun Pharmaceutical), Penegra (Zydus Cadila), Manly (Cooper Pharma) and Zenegra (Alkem Laboratories).

#### New Zealand

Sildenafil was reclassified in New Zealand in 2014 so it could be bought over the counter from a pharmacist. It is thought that this reduced sales over the Internet and was safer as males could be referred for medical advice if appropriate.

#### South Korea

In 1999 South Korea granted two patents to Pfizer related to sildenafil. The first document guaranteed sole production and sale of the substance until 2012, while the second gave Pfizer the exclusive use to treating erectile dysfunction with sildenafil until 2014. In 2011 Hanmi Pharmaceutical and CJ CheilJedang launched a suit against the exclusive use patent. The Korean Court system made a ruling against Pfizer in June 2012, allowing for the unhindered domestic production of generic prescription sildenafil.
In 2012, Viagra lost its position as the top selling erectile dysfunction treatment in South Korea. This development was credited largely "due to the introduction of generic products." Generic sildenafil became publicly available in May. Sales of PalPal by Hanmi Pharmaceuticals totalled ₩22 billion or about 86% the market share of Viagra that year. By 2017, there were over 50 generic sildenafil pills available. During that year Viagra sales slumped to 38% that of Palpal.

#### United Kingdom

There were 2,958,199 prescriptions for Sildenafil in 2016 in England, compared with 1,042,431 in 2006.
In 2018, Viagra Connect, a particular formulation of Sildenafil marketed by Pfizer, became available for sale without a prescription in the UK.
