4-Benzylpiperidine is a drug and research chemical used in scientific studies. It has been encountered as a designer drug.

## Pharmacology

4-Benzylpiperidine acts as a monoamine releasing agent with 20- to 48-fold selectivity for releasing dopamine versus serotonin. It is most efficacious as a releaser of norepinephrine, with an EC50 of 109 nM (DA), 41.4 nM (NE), and 5,246 nM (5-HT).
It also functions as a weak monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) (IC50Tooltip half-maximal inhibitory concentration = 130 μM for MAO-ATooltip monoamine oxidase A and 750 μM for MAO-BTooltip monoamine oxidase B).
The drug has a fast onset of action and a short duration.

## Synthesis

4-Cyanopyridine can be reacted with toluene to give 4-benzylpyridine. Catalytic hydrogenation of the pyridine ring then completes the synthesis.

## Applications

RMI-10608 is a derivative of 4-benzylpiperidine and analog of haloperidol that was discovered to have potential use in treating psychosis and preventing brain damage by virtue of its NMDA antagonist pharmacology.
