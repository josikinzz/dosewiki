Woohoo another new megathread


Anyone have any experience with doing their own extractions with kratom? I was wondering if preparing in a soy lecithin mixture or even warm milk might help to extract a broader alkaloid spectrum than just making tea with water

YEah I'm kind of curious about this as well. I boil down the tea until it turns into resin, which is nice because you can carry it around and pop it like a pill or throw it in some boiling water and have 'instant' kratom tea, but I feel like a lot of alkaloids get wasted. Not only that but I've heard such conflicting information in regards to the water solubility of mitragynine and also conflicting reports of whether heat degrades the alkaloids. What I always do is leave it on a low simmer. I'd like to try the alcohol extraction method, but for the next five weeks I have to give urine tests for this outpatient program I'm in, and they test for alcohol.


And from what I've heard, milk can 'ruin' the effects of kratom. I don't know why but I've seen quite a few posts about that.

Milk contains a lot of calcium. Calcium binds to varius drugs, like antibiotics for example preventing gut absorption, maybe this is happening with kratom too ?

I might just experiment a bit. Znegative about how much extra kratom do you have to use for a dose of resin compared to a T&W dose? That sounds super convenient, and convenience is one reason why I'm wondering about at home extractions.


I really don't want to fuck around with buying super extracts and killing my tolerance

Forgive me for the Newb Kratom question but what is the best way to take kratom, can I just mix it with juice? I am just skeptical of ordering anything over the Internet as who know what is really in the product. Sorry just my paranoid side.

I got a digital scale so I just way out the resulting resin and then divide it according to the original amount of kratom I put in. For instance, if I used 50 grams of kratom to make the resin and came out with 10g, I'd have a 5x extraction, although some of the kratom does get lost in the process (but such is the truth about tea anyway). Usually though I can't deduce the volume by more then 4x, I don't know how some people do that. With the resin I can take 1-2g of it and its way easier to get down then T&W with plant matter. I also think it hits you faster because your bodies not trying to digest grams and grams of plant matter.


Recently I've found that tea is the only way I can 'get off' on kratom at all, T&W doesn't do shit, not matter how much or little I dose. It's real weird, though I feel like it has something to do with the fact that my teeth feel like they're falling out of my head half the time, so I might not notice the typical opioid effects as much because it's dulling that pain.

You can definitely just mix it with juice, or you can make tea out of it. Honestly mixing it with something like almond milk works the best IMO because it masks the horrible taste. If you make tea you lose some of the alkaloids in the process but it hits you hella fast, like within 5 minutes because the alkaloids are already extracted.

I really want to try doing an alcohol extract as well but I got to wait a couple weeks until I'm done with my outpatient program because they test for the ethanol metabolite. I've done a bit of reading on the alcohol extraction method and from what I ascertain, in order to extract a good amount of alkaloids in a manner of hours, one has to put the kratom in a jar and then boil some water and then put the alcohol/kratom jar in that boiling water, loosening the cover of the jar to relieve the pressure. Otherwise I'm fairly certain that you'd have to leave the kratom/alchohol sitting around for a week or two in order to extract the maximum amount of goods. Other than that though your plan seems good. I'm pretty sure though that regardless of whether you use alcohol or just water, you're not going to get a 'full spectrum' extraction. I've read that the water extraction (tea) and the alcohol extraction both feel different from each other and from just regular T&W which I imagine is because certain alkaloids are more soluble in alcohol others in water. Let us know how it goes though. I would take the discarded plant material from the alcohol extraction and then do a water extraction on it and compare the two.


Also I'm curious as to whether the alcohol extraction when evaporated is a powder or if it's a tar like the tea method.


Another thing I've noticed is that it seems the longer you let the kratom with water and citric acid steep before boiling, the better. I try to wait a few hours but on occasions I've let it steep overnight and that made the strongest tea. It also improves the flavor ALOT, way less bitter.

To get the broadest spectrum of alkaloids, you would need to do separate extractions of the same plant material with 95% ethanol, water, then a mixture of the two. Combining these extractions would then yield a wide variety of alkaloids. 


Basically, you can repeat extractions with different solvents on the solid plant material you collect from filtering. Since water and ethanol are miscible, you wouldn't really get a wider variety by using say 50% v/v ethanol solution

Lucky you. I got 250g of red vein sumatran coming tomorrow, just want it to keep me calm and happy. Hope to God it works cos if so I'm good for the next 25 days. Then game over for the kratom, illegal here soon :-(

How long have you been taking kratom? I'm curious because I'm real new to it, and when I first started their didn't seem to really be a 'ceiling', the more I took the better I felt, though if I went to high I'd get nauseous and shaky, now though 2 1/2 months in to taking kratom every day, it seems like the more I take, the less 'effects' I get from it, to the point where I feel like taking a tablespoon would actually provide less then one teaspoon. I don't know if this is because my body is having a hard time digesting all the plant matter or what, but looking at whats left of my kratom stash today I've decided to try to dose as little and as infrequently as possible, since I don't feel the effects of T&W at high dosages anyway, might as well lower the dosage. I'd keep making the tea but I seriously have to use so much kratom and it's getting a little bit wasteful.

I have been taking Kratom for close to two months now, I found that 4 teaspoons is my sweet spot, if I take anymore I get sick, any less I don't feel it too much.

I plan on taking less soon to taper off. I think it's different for everyone you just need to find your sweet spot.

Definitely. I would reccomend doing two or three extractions--water, everclear (95% grain alcohol), and 50/50. Doing one extraction with a 50/50 mix might not extract any more alkaloids than one or the other since the two liquids are miscible.


A 50/50 mix will act like a solvent with properties somewhere between alcohol and water, while doing separate extractions with each solvent on the same material would pull the relatively polar vs nonpolar alkaloids better


I think if would be an interesting experiment to compare ethanol vs water vs 50/50 mix vs all three

Sorry to bombard you with questions, but how often do you dose per day? I really need to check the compulsive side to my personality, if that's possible.

This is a weird question and I'm not sure if it's psychological or not but is there anyone else here who isn't dependent on Kratom on a daily basis but who may take it a couple days in a row and then afterwards on an off day get some extra munchies or oral fixation??


I feel like maybe sometimes it happens to me if I had a weekend where I took a lot and then don't on a Monday but maybe it's not actually a real connection.


I guess it might make sense since whenever I try to quit or cut down on coffee I also a get a SERIOUS oral fixation and want to eat sweets and that happens with smokers too.

Also, does anyone know if Kratom has a negative effect on weight loss??


I know it does SOMETHING with blood sugar but last year I was exercising like crazy trying to lose a lot of weight while taking Kratom and couldn't lose weight and then when I stopped taking it for a while I lost weight so I wonder if there was a connection.


There's no need to mention that it's an appetite suppressant, as in truth that ISN'T a real benefit to sustainable weight loss and weight maintainence cause you'll just eat less than you should which isnt' good either.


If anyone knows about this let me know.

Those of you who have also used poppy seed tea, have any of you experienced a complete absence of any effects from kratom after PST usage? Like, it was wonderful, kratom never disappointed, but after trying poppy seed tea from the very first time, the kratom effects are completely gone (and had, as always, a great time with it just the weekend before, and same batch, same dosage) and there's been decent breaks between both substances. It's as if PST has completely fried whatever receptors liked the kratom, they're just done for. Tried PST about 3 months ago, and have had this new issue with kratom ever since, yet have read of users alternating between the two successfully. Wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience.

That's kind of weird, and you're not a daily user of either? I imagine it's just an issue of cross tolerance and you had some good pods. I never fucked with PST, but I had a wicked black tar heroin habit for hella long, and on day 4 of kicking it I took some kratom and got relief even a little buzzed. 


Anyway I fucked up last month and got some shitty kratom, so I just got some new WV maeng Da and some Bali, those are the ones I like the best. Also, With the previous kratom I did an alcohol extraction and have been letting it evaporate for the last few days. I'm curious to see how it turns out. I've heard many conflicting reports, some people saying the alcohol extraction is more stimulating, others saying that it's the opposite.

Yeah, breaks are regularly taken like 4-5 days in between usage, trying to keep it to just the weekend. Even tried alternating weekends with no luck. It sucks ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)

Wait, that makes no sense to me. Kratom won't work but a perk 5 will? How much kratom do you take? I thought PST was supposed to kind of be bullshit too, compared to pod tea? Thats real weird. Do you make tea or T&W?


As for kratom causing weight gain, that seems a bit strange to me too. I can eat on it, but I don't have much of an appetite.

[MENTION=409771]sashadawn[/MENTION], don't underestimate potent PST!  Your tolerance is likely a bit higher now, and as kratom can only go so high, it feels like you're missing out.  That will only change of you don't do anymore opiates, which i highly recommend.  All kratom does for me now is take away pain.  Not very glamorous.


And no one should underestimate PST.  I've done loads of it, dry pods, fresh pods and just dry/fresh latex as tea.  PST tastes exactly like latex tea because that is what it is.  Thankfully even the best seeds online aren't as potent as they could be.  M2c:  stick to kratom, forget opiates.  They mess you up.

Yep, always taken 3.5 grams of kratom  t&w method with orange juice. Sometimes would have percocets or hydros on occasion (nothing ever stronger then a 5) never noticed them messing with kratom's effects, but PST has completely obliterated it, so strange. Perhaps another substance in PST that isn't present in pills is the culprit?... But that still doesn't explain why no one else has experienced it I guess, it is a really weird mystery.


Never have tried pod tea, but have experienced great results from PST, aside from some major digestive system upset, but a gas-x and stool softener usually help enough.

That is good advice, I did have a close call with PST the first time I tried it, could barely move without puking. Maybe that's when I screwed up something...


I loved the kratom and saw no need to look into anything else, but once I stumbled upon the article about the study of mitragynine screwing with your heart rhythm, it scared me a little since one side of my family has nearly all been diagnosed with Long QT, so I began to look into other things like PST. But, like others have pointed out, the study doesn't specify how much mitragynine was used, for all we know it was a ridiculous amount, so I am kinda wishing I would have not strayed from kratom now!

I'm a regular Kratom user (no high doses) since years and never had acute or chronic heart problems (at least obviously not from Kratom). There were some bad (or too strong?) batches that caused palpitations but those batches/vendors were ditched immediately.


Kratom is primarily not about mitragynine anyways imho. The orchestration of numerous alkaloids creates the unique experience and I found out, that I like sorts which feel least opioid the most. Kratom euphoria imho has not much to do with mitragynine content. Pure speculation. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


Nevertheless, it is best if you do not take Kratom, if you have concerns, as long as it cannot be excluded, that Kratom has significant effects on the cardiovascular system.

I'm curious because I'm real new to it, and when I first started their didn't seem to really be a 'ceiling', the more I took the better I felt, though if I went to high I'd get nauseous and shaky, now though 2 1/2 months in to taking kratom every day,** it seems like the more I take, the less 'effects' I get from it, to the point where I feel like taking a tablespoon would actually provide less then one teaspoon**. I don't know if this is because my body is having a hard time digesting all the plant matter or what, but looking at whats left of my kratom stash today I've decided to try to dose as little and as infrequently as possible, since I don't feel the effects of T&W at high dosages anyway, might as well lower the dosage. I'd keep making the tea but I seriously have to use so much kratom and it's getting a little bit wasteful.

I have two explanations :


1. You're after an opioid feeling and the increasing number of opioid-antagonists of increasing Kratom doses cancel out the mitragynine (and analogues) in your case


2. You're after a stimulant feeling and with increasing doses the stimulant buzz is killed by the mitragynine (and analogues)

The study you are talking about did NOT say that Kratom CAUSES Long QT syndrome but that IN RATS (or whatever they were testing on, so I ASSUME rats or mice) it can EXACERBATE ALREADY EXISTED Long QT syndrome.


That being said, if it exists in your family I personally would definitely steer clear in that case.


But if it doesn't I wouldn't be concerned.


Even that said, the study seemed to kind of be a little vague and didn't seem to necessarily produce some "set in stone" conclusion.

Does ANYONE have ANY possible idea of how to increase the length of Kratom experiences??


I mean I'm sure there really is no way otherwise we'd have figured it out already.


Today for some odd reason by experience was even shorter than usual, only like 3 hours when usually I feel good for 4 or 4 1/2.


I have heard there MIGHT be some strains out there that least longer.


Does anyone know of a strain that consistently lasts longer than 4 hours for them or any possible way to increase the length of the experience??


(Obviously I know we can't discuss vendors so even if someone mentions a strain that lasts longer for them it will probably not be that useful for me, but nevertheless we can try)...


I used to just dose all day long but now if I exceed a certain number of grams per day I get withdrawal the next day.

I haven't actually been tested for Long QT, but many of my family members have had an official diagnosis and I do know I have a history of heart palpitations. I wish we could get a concrete answer on the circumstances of that study.

I need to get some Kratom here soon. Preparing for PST withdrawl.  What should I be looking for while browsing for quality stuff? Am I wanting whole leafs ? Or get pure leaf in powdered form? I've heard stay away from extracts and headshop kratom. The only kratom ive tried is headshop kratom and it has been ok but not the greatest.  Also is it worth my time to stock up on grapefruit juice as well?  What are some of the best ways to make it more potent? I've got some capsules that contain cayenne pepper and other shit that are supposed to make the effects stronger.

You know, I really wouldn't bother with the whole grapefruit juice, turmeric, and other potentiators. I've never really noticed any difference in terms of effects from taking them. I know some people will swear by it and I guess it probably has to do with individual brain chemistry, but I would first just try kratom by itself. I've never gotten leaf, just powder, from what I've read it's easier to deal with especially if you're making tea, and it probably absorbs faster. The only thing that I've heard that everyone seems to agree with is that kava and kratom have a really great synergy which I'd like to try.

It's kind of nice to have a few strands on hand to keep things fresh, but IME (which is limited to only a couple months now of using kratom in place of Buprenorphine), it's more important to just get good kratom, rather then strand, because after a while it all really does the same thing, as long as it's good. The only times I can notice a difference is if one strand is especially weak seeming, or if I just use one or two strands for a couple of weeks and then get a new one. The white vein maeng da is pretty good for it's stimulating properties, but at the right dosage it can be sedating too.

> Also be careful not to dose to high on kratom, I made that mistake when I first started taking it, thinking that 'well if 7g has me feeling great, then 21g will have me nodding!'. Kratom does not work like that, and a kratom overdose is a very unpleasant think-feels kind of like experiencing a caffeine overdose while high and paranoid on marijuana, and it makes you dizzy, nauseous and shaky. It sucks. After a while I've become more tolerant to kratom so I can handle slightly higher dosages, but it seems there's really no use for *me* to take more then 6-7g (via the T&W method). With lower dosages I really believe you can enjoy it more, but it's the kind of thing you've got to experiment with. I still fuck up and try to get high off of it more often then I'd like, and I'm always underwhelmed. So I'm learning to be happy with what I do get from it, and it's a hell of a lot better then suboxone, IMO.

Thanks for the information.  I really appreciate it! I might just give kratom a shot this time and stay away from the subutex.  I've already have lope on hand to combat the runs and plan on getting L-Tyrosine and some other vitamins/supplements to help with the withdrawl.  Any suggestions for the RLS?  I'm thinking about ordering Elimidrol or  withdrawl ease that way I can get all the ingredients to help combat withdrawl from one product.  Looks like I will be searching for some good Red Bali Kratom and am ready to give this a shot again. I'm hoping I will be able to sleep and go to work with no major symptoms .  My gf is fed up with my habit and it's causing to many problems and costing way too much$. I appreciate your response!

8 oz of pure grapefruit makes the difference between 8 grams an 1.2 grams of kratom for me. I never use kratom w/o GFJ. Always 15-30min before and during the dosage. Makes kratom what it is to me.

Basshead, that's an excellent plan.  I  used kratom to quit pst, pods and latex (all eaten, all the same thing basically).  Read my thread in sober living of you want to know more!  How long are you using?  I did one really heavy year, and the WD was the first from any substance for me.  It was awful and the acute part lasted nearly three weeks, get some immodium and prepare not to sleep for days and days and days.


As for sources, always go with online stuff.  Crushed or while leaf is usually 2X more potent than powder, as the finely powdered kratom oxidizes.  One of my favs was the kratom king, sorry off that's vendor discussion but their prices were fair and shipping fast.  But there's tons of vendors out there.  One i didn't like was kraken, they didn't ship for ages.  Jm2c


It's wonderful you want to quit, my own life is so much more worth living again.  Opiods made me a sex less, pathetic constipated zombie.  I'm a dude and it dropped my testosterone to practically zero, heck it even stopped hair loss.  Opiods are more insidious than they appear ..

Wait did KRATOM drop your testosterone and stop your hair loss??


Or was that PST, Pods and Latex??


I only dose Kratom 2-3 days a week MAX but that's got me concerned if you are talking about Kratom...


I already know I need to cut down and have wondered when I feel mild Kratom withdrawals like today...resulting in laziness and lethargy, if that is due to decreased testosterone...or is it just mild WD??


They say that even drinking lowers you testosterone the day after when you are hungover and that's one reason we might act or feel like a bitch lol, so is it really that different??

Hey thanks for the kind words and the support! I have been using PST for a year now.. I know what the withdrawl is like, I went a few days without any tea due to a package being lost and it was not fun.  I have successfully quit opiates before using a quick suboxone taper. I have considered using the same method to kick the PST habit, but waiting 72 hours to dose the sub to avoid precipitated WD will be tough.  I want to give Kratom a shot this time around and have read tons of posts and stories about people using it to successfully kick their opiate habit.  I will check out your thread for sure and also have a couple questions for you (will shoot you an IM). Thanks

I'm also not sure that the difference between strains isn't mostly placebo either.


I try to convince myself that they feel different but more and more I'm not sure there is much of one.


I remember Sekio did one study that seemed to show they all have similar alkaloids.


But tons of people think they are different.


I think the only way to know is to do a blind taste test: have someone put some in a bag without you knowing what it is and take it and see if you can guess based on how it feels.


I've never had access to cimetidine so I don't know.


Is that something that is only prescription or can it be found online or OTC?

This is kind of how I feel about it, from my short experience with kratom it seems that switching a strain if you've been using one for a couple of weeks will produce sometimes different, or 'fresher' effects, but after a few days, I really can't tell much of a difference. It seems that some strains are more tolerable at higher dosages, like I can only take so much Bali before it starts making me feel shitty but with maeng da I can take a lot more. Also does anyone know what alkaloid is responsible for Kratoms stimulant effects? Most of the time I only feel an opioid type buzz, but every once in a while I'll get the stimulation if I dose just right and it's actually pretty distinct, much more comparable to something like 'amphetamine-light'.

I'm not sure what alkaloid causes the stimulant effect but it is pretty consistent for me when I dose properly and it is actually my favorite thing about Kratom over the opioid effect and whenever I am unlucky enough NOT to get it as a part of my Kratom high I am disappointed.


I would say that a good 80% or more of the time at SOME POINT in my 4 hour or so Kratom high I will get stimulant effect which may last a little while or it may last almost the entire experience.


Of course I drink a lot of coffee which potentiates it and I think adds to the stimulant effect but I've also become a big fan of combining Kratom with Prolintane or Dexadrine for the added stimulant effect (and I often have Phenibut in the mix as well)...but in reality...I think Kratom dosed properly and a little caffeine on the side will reliably give me that stimulant effect.


Generally lowering dosing gives me more of the stimulant effect and higher dosing more of the sedative effect which is pretty much unanimously agreed upon.

If you use liquid put an inch or so of HOT water in first and mix the kratom first in that. The hot water will allow it to mix in almost instantly then fill the rest of the glass up with whatever else you plan to use (water, juice, etc) and try to slam it in one breath so you only have to taste it once. Another method I use is "000" capsules, I can fit around a gram in one.

See lately I've been having a real issue with this. I try to get that effect out of it, but now it seems like lower dosages do nothing, and whenever I do get anything out of it, it's an opioid effect. And I really need to get myself motivated too! Lol. Prolintane has now peaked my interest.


@lelnigga-

You can make it in to tea, or you can take orange juice, and mix the powder in with that. At first it just sits at the top but if you give it a good stir the acidity begins to brake it down, until it's almost fully dissolved. With the right ratios kratom and OJ is actually quite bareable.

Hey, all.  I'm getting 3 different strains of kratom by post today: green malay, red vein borneo, and green bali.  I used to use high doses of kratom daily, so I took a long break (over a year).  This is my first order since then.  I am so excited!

Yeah, I have mixed feelings about Prolintane.


At first I didn't think I'd order more when I ran out but now that I have I will.


Overall, IF you have any access to Dexadrine or Adderall (which I DON'T) I think it is very much inferior to them except MAYBE in the one sense that IF you want something that lasts longer it lasts about 7 hours  as opposed to about 4 for Dex/Add for me, but if you wanted that you could just redose.


It is a VERY fine powder usually, hard to weigh out your doses properly and even the SLIGHTEST bit more can make the difference between euphoria and being QUITE uncomfortable.


The stimulation can be VERY rough around the edges and a bit hard on the body at times, but that is also why it goes SOO well with Kratom and/or Phenibut as both of them help reduce that feeling, and so does Klonopin to some extent as well.


It took me a long time to figure out my perfect dosage which FOR ME is 50mgs, and if I exceed that by much I usually have a bad experience.


I had a few pretty uncomfortable experiences early on, but more and more the longer I used it the better I got at getting a positive experience out of it.


It can feel pretty good if dosed JUST RIGHT and if you have access to substances that can decrease the edge like Kratom, Phenibut and benzos.


But out of any drug I've ever used (because I have never used RC) it is the strongest mg per mg.


It is the LAST drug you would EVER want to "eyeball" and NOT use a scale with!!!!


I always sat there and weighed out my dose and wouldn't take it until it said the same dosage I wanted THREE TIMES IN A ROW to be sure I had the dose I wanted.


Usually my OCD works against me but in this unique case it works for me and I'd get the dose I wanted.


A couple little extra flakes could mean the difference between 50mgs and 80mgs or 80mgs and 120mgs and a good experience and a REALLY bad one.


So you need a good scale.


I'm hoping it isn't bad for one's heart.


I mean it WAS approved for use with geriatrics in the 1950s and runs with the reputation of a "good safety profile" so take that for what it's worth.


I guess It probably carries the same risks as things like Dexadrine and Adderall but IF you have access to those I wouldn't see a reason in bothering.


If NOT like me, it might be what you are looking for.

**Study suggests storing your kratom IN sunlight could = higher potency!?!?!**


Now, granted, I haven't done much research into the credibility of this "study", and I could totally be misconceiving what they're trying to convey....but.....


> "Previous studies had suggested the plant itself produced 7-hydroxymitragynine. Sames says the team could detect it by mass spectrometry, but only at very low concentrations. Instead, the team demonstrated that sunlight and oxidizing conditions can convert about half of the mitragynine in solution to 7-hydroxymitragynine. And sunlight alone can convert about 8% of the mitragynine. Therefore, the team concluded that **storage conditions can affect the potency of an extract by *increasing *the amount of the oxidized alkaloid.**"

I would imagine this would only apply to a live plant, but the wording they use suggests otherwise.  Is it possible that it could simply mean the harvested material being stored near sunlight could result in the conversion of mitragynine into 7-hydroxymitragynine??  


Most likely wishful thinking here.

That's super interesting. I read through the article and it mentions a 'solution' and an 'extract' which makes me think they're talking about it in a liquid suspension form like tea or something. I wonder if this is true and I wonder how long it would take being left out in sunlight. I just got a bunch of kratom so I want to make an extract and it would be cool if I could easily and naturally convert half the mitragynine into 7-HM.

They're talking about solvated mitragynine. An extract will solublize a lot of the mitragynine. This might explain why extracts tend to skyrocket tolerance (not personally experienced with extracts, just from reading anecdotal reports). 


Really cool stuff. I saw this article in CEN, and it's awesome that researchers are looking towards applied research with kratom alkaloids

Kava potentiates Kratom. Whenever I used the two together, I would not nod but I would zone out really hard, and I could snap myself out of it, but it felt kind of cool at first. Then it just got annoying. But, yeah definitely more sedating when you add kava, and It's definitely a totally different experience when from Kratom alone.

I'm doing a water extract too. How many grams of resin do you get out of 200g? I usually wind up with somewhere between a 3-4x extract. I'm wondering if there is a way to reduce it further.

How long does it take to become physically addicted to kratom?  I usually dose 50-70g kratom daily, and I've been doing this for about 3 weeks now. Also are the withdrawals anything compared to heroin withdrawals?

Hmm. At this very high dose probably there is no big difference regarding the withdrawals. ![8o](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eek.gif) It should still be somewhat milder, as ususally the effects plateau on a certain dose cause Kratom is just a partial agonist.


Sorry man, that cannot be healthy longterm. Tapering down is a viable method if you use it as a substitute.

HOW the FUCK do you dose 50-70grams daily?!?!?!


Dude...MY usage is considered HUGE by most in that there have been times I've dosed up to an ounce a day (28 grams) and STILL I NEVER did that more than 3 days a week and abstained the rest, though these days I usually keep it below 20 grams and never do that more than twice a week, but that quantity is the HIGHEST BY FAR I've EVER heard of.


I don't know how you can keep down that much powder and not throw up and still go to the bathroom but I don't think that much is good for you and you should do everything possible to lower your dosage.


Let me ask you: when you FIRST tried Kratom...like literally the SINGLE first time you tried it, what dosage got you to where you wanted to be??


7grams?


10grams?


20 grams??


Were you coming off a heroin addiction or other opiate addiction that had your tolerance high to begin with??


That would explain a lot if true.


I don't know how anyone could let their dosage get THAT high.


But there's no single amount that gets anyone addicted but if you've been dosing that much EVERY SINGLE DAY for THREE weeks you are already going to be HEAVILY addicted/dependent, sorry to tell you.


I think I could dose that much ONE day a week once a week and be dependent as it isn't only based on how many days per week you dose but how much you dose each time as I believe it stays in your system for a couple days so you should really think about it in terms of how many grams per WEEK you dose and not how many per day.


Now tolerance plays SOME factor, but regardless, that kind of usage is ABSOLUTELY out of control.


Now it is your body and not my place to tell you what to do but if you DON'T want to be physically dependent, which it sounds like you don't, you are going about this the wrong way and need to get your dosage down to LESS than 28 grams a day and IMO I would also not dose more than 4 days a week.


If you can get yourself to that point you should have it SOMEWHAT more under control and maybe consider dropping to around 15 grams no more than 3 days a week and be in a decent spot (at least for ME that's relatively ok yet STILL considered a heavy dose by many users..but they also usually dose daily so we are about equal in grams per week), but the way you are doing this you are going to go through SERIOUS withdrawal when you try to stop.


Where  did you ever get the idea that you could dose THAT high and that it would be ok?!??!


Cause NO ONE on Bluelight would tell you that is a good dosing regimen.

When I first started using kratom I needed at least 25g, and yes I was coming from a heroin addiction so I have a tolerance. I never really quit heroin though, I'd just take breaks,  so that coupled with continued kratom use has driven up my tolerance. I've had it start using extracts because 70g was really hard to keep down.

Ok that makes more sense.


Since I never used heroin (and never will) I can't really help here, but yes, I believe your usage is too high and you are probably chemically dependent but that is better than heroin.


I'd AT LEAST urge you to avoid extracts and only use plain leaf.


I'd also suggest tapering to SOME point of "moderation" but what point you want to get to in terms of what dosage and how often you want to dose is entirely up to you.


So I 'd say choose what you WANT to get your dosage and dosing schedule down to, and then ask some other former heroin users who tapered using Kratom on this forum how to do it, cause there are DEFINITELY LOTS of them on here who I think could help you.


Good luck.

LOL, that's fine man.


I just think that if people want to use drugs for recreation rather than medication it's morally ok so long as it doesn't hurt anyone else and we should help them to avoid negative health effects as much as possible rather than try to convince them to stop using.


If someone wants to use a drug then they are going to use it and sometimes even the law cannot stop them, as is shown by the ridiculous war on drugs.


So I find it's best not to take a stance that people shouldn't try to manage their own recreational drug use, and instead accept that they will do what they are going to do and give them advice (if they want it) on how to minimize the damage they do to themselves.


IF ONLY doctors (and psychiatrists also) would do that more often and we could just be blunt with them and tell them what we are using and have them not preach to us but try to tell us the good, the bad and the ugly and tell us if there's ANY way we can use these substances and minimize the harm, it would be AMAZING.


Some more forward thinking countries/cities like Amsterdam and Portugal are taking this route and it's great, and then you've got the worst of the worst when it comes to Australia, the U.K., Indonesia, Malaysia, etc and their archaic laws.


In reality, the U.S. is a better place to be a drug user than a lot of countries, but IMO this shit needs to stop.


Drug use and drug users need to stop being demonized.


At most, it's a HEALTH issue, not a legal one IMO.

I saw it offered for sale in a bodega in NYC.


Perhaps, one could suspend it in clarified butter, or olive oil?

Really? That's weird, I don't doubt it but I've never seen kratom sold in head shops in NYC, which is where I was born and lived until 3 years ago. Then again I didn't go to head shops that much.


Anyway why would you want to suspend it in clarified butter or olive oil? Is that in regard to SS's earlier post about converting mitragynine into 7-HM? 


Also, Mycophile, I agree with you 100% on your post. The U.S is terrible with it's drug policies, but it also varies where you live. It seems like in Ohio drug offenses are taken vary seriously (that's just my impression-havn't used anything illegal since I came here), but in the bay area it's practically legal to shoot dope.

Question for those of you who have used kratom for withdrawl.  How many days does it take to start feeling ok when making the transition to kratom?  Am I still going to feel like shit for a few days or does it immediately help?  I am planning a detox from PST soon and need to work it around my work schedule. I have tried Kratom before but it was shitty headshop kratom so it didn't help too much tbh. Any info would be appreciated.  Thanks

You know, it's hard for me to say but I'll share my experience with it. When I first moved to Ohio I couldn't get on methadone or Suboxone for about two weeks and was kicking dope HARD. I didn't take any opioid based drugs at all, with the exception of a few tramadol that didn't do much for me, but that wasn't until the third or forth day. By the 5th day the worst of the withdrawals were over but I still felt like hell, so I got some Kratom and I immediately felt wayyy better.


When I switched from Suboxone to Kratom, there was no adjustment period. I had tapered myself down to 2-3mg SL dose of Buprenorphine, and at the right dosage, the kratom held me perfectly. In fact, I felt incredibly euphoric the first few days after transitioning off Suboxone. The only thing is that Kratom wears off pretty quickly, so you have to dose it much more often then you would with Suboxone or methadone, but at the same time it's also very easy to taper your dose down too.

Is there any methodical approach to doing this? I've been taking Kratom for a little less than a year and my tolerance is far too high for my liking. How do you go about tapering? How much less do you take day-to-day? If you've done so, that is. I experience withdrawals when I don't have it in my system for a while. The symptoms are manageable, just kind of shitty.


I use the T&W method, I've heard that making tea is more efficient but I have been given no evidence to support that claim. Your thoughts?

It depends on what you mean by "most efficient".  If your talking about "bang for the buck" and getting the most out of your kratom I would argue the opposite. Eating kratom is a sure fire way to get as many alkaloids out of it as possible.  It may take longer to kick in, but it should last longer too.


Now, your original question had to do with tapering.   If you were to make tea instead of T&W, maybe you would get less of an effect and that would technically decrease your dosage.  I would just suggest taking a little bit less each time you T&W. Get a scale and step down in  0.5 - 1 gram increments. Get comfortable at your new dosage for a week and then step down again.  It will take patience and willpower.... I've never had much success tapering but best of luck to you. Addiction sucks!

  ehh i dont recommend you looking for amphetamines or similar things to give you motivation for one reason only, they ALL end up backfiring on you...sure it might work for a few days or even weeks but tolerance builds and u need more and that strong motivational effect u got from it in the beginning is gone and u are worse off  ..this has been my experience every time with stims..


  instead id recommend you try out Welbutrin or maybe something like Selegiline..Selegiline is helping me but its not a huge kick like stims, its very subtle..

  using that much kratom you will be dependent on it very quickly..if u were to quit right now u would likely suffer some mild withdrawals like achy body, watery eyes, low energy...i recommend you gving kratom a break..take a few weeks off or a month because if you are dosing that high already then what are you goin to do in the future?

Hi everyone, I'm new to the forum.  I've been lurking around for a while, but not posted much.  I'm a heavy kratom user (22-49g per day) and lately I've been wondering about long term use and the effect on health.


I've been using the above dosage daily for over three years. Besides withdrawal symptoms (if I miss a dose) there's not a lot of other issues.  However, I'm wondering about the effect on the liver, heart, the throat and the GI tract (Toss & Wash seems like it could be harsh on the throat, and 40g is a lot of powder for the intestines.)


Does anyone have any knowledge or know if any articles or studies on habitual kratom use that aren't outdated?  Thanks!

Chronic high dose consumption can lead to :


- darkening of the skin (native south east asians, that took Kratom for decades/centuries, were observed)

- Kratom can cause liver complications in predisposed patients

- Mytraginine can cause ventricular fibrillation (or similar, please search the search engine for Kratom megathreads with the term "heart", there was a study posted by pbuilder, I guess)


I personally did not experience any of those symptoms, but I don't take such high doses. I would suggest you to taper a bit down, because using high doses is a waste, unless you utilize Kratom as a substitution for opiates. Anyway tapering and pauses are always advisable but you know that. :D

**Kratom Stopped Working. Why?**


Well its not so much that it stopped working, its that 9 times out of 10 it seems to cause weird headache/pressure in my head. Ive been using it on and off for the past 2 years. For a while kratom worked so well. It helped me kick dope, then it gave me these great, active, social highs for a long time after (I hear some opiate addicts say they cannot get high on kratom. That was not the case for me) then addiction and tolerance happened, and i had to start taking some breaks.


Its hard to pin point when it happened exactly, but all of a sudden, most times I would take it I would get a weird feeling of pressure in my head and what i assume to be a tension headache. I still felt "high" from the kratom, but it was uncomfortable and dysphoric. Sometimes I still get a good buzz from it, but most times i don't. I quit for 4 months and tried to start back up again recently and its still causing this pressure in my head!


Has this happened to anyone else? Why would the effects change so drastically? Is there any way to combat it? I just want those sweet kratom feels back again ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png) It was a good alternative to meth and H... IS kratom gone forever?

Huh, that's weird-I've gotten headaches like that a few times from kratom, but not enough that it caused me any problems. Suboxone was a much worse culprit in that regard for me. But I relate to what you say about it not really working over time. I seem to have gotten to that point. I need to seriously reduce my intake, because I don't feel my dosages at all anymore, and like you, I actually did get a nice 'euphoric' experience from it at the beginning, and I was coming off a wicked IV heroin habit too. I mean don't get me wrong, the high from kratom is not relatable really to a heroin high. For me it felt like what 15mg of hydrocodone would feel like to someone with no tolerance-Not saying hydrocodone and kratom are equipotent or anything, but you get the idea.


For me what's annoying is that more than anything I don't get the stimulant property out of it anymore. It used to be so cool how depending on the dosage I could get a stim effect or an opioid effect. Now it's like I just feel normal, and really I don't want to sound like I'm complaining because I was a hopeless heroin addict just a few days ago, and today I get by on drinking tea ha.


Anyway, I'm going to merge this into the Kratom Megathread.

Fuck I typed a long post and lost it all. Anyways, the stim effect is always the first to go for me. Now kratom just makes me tired. Don't get much euphoria from it anymore--mainly just sedation. I might try upping my dose tonight to see if I can catch a buzz

Accidentally measured out about 2 extra grams to throw in my tea this morning. For the entire morning at work I was wobbling around clearly fucked up unable to do mostly anything. Also threw up a few times in the trash can that I wheel around (I'm a janitor).


I thought red strains were the only kind you could get a nod on, but this green Maeng Da killed me. Probably would've enjoyed it if I wasn't at work...

ALL strains CAN be sedating, but you are probably new to Kratom to get such an extreme experience right??


When I was new to it if I overdid it by just a couple grams I'd feel like shit.


Now that I have taken so many excessive doses so many times I am pretty much immune to any side effects worse than feeling a little tired or SLIGHTLY nauseas and needing to take some Pepto Bismol.


The more I took it, the fewer side effects I was having.


Kind of makes sense in connection to how you hear that when people are taking new medications of any kind the chances for side effects are better early on before their body gets used to it.


I never feel all super sick if I take too much like I used to.


I never threw up from Kratom before though.


I'd suggest more carefully weighing out your dosage, but it's possible that like me, over time you MIGHT stop getting those negative effects.


For me there's a ceiling to how high I can get AND any negative side effects....past a certain dosage I might as well have taken the same amount BOTH in terms of my level of highness and lack of side effects.


It's basically like weed in that way:  I used to smoke and smoke but failed to realize I wasn't getting any higher past a certain point lol.


Neither Kratom or Weed is like alcohol where you just get more and more drunk or fucked up the more you drink.


Both have ceilings.


If 18 grams gets me super high (that's about my max dose...VERY high by most people's standards) taking 28 grams won't make me ANY more high or feel ANY more sick (except MAYBE a little uneasy in my stomach, not enough to throw up but just bloated from extra powder) and it'll just be like I didn't even take any extra at all.


The ONLY negative side effect it WILL increase is my amount of withdrawal the next day since I don't dose everyday and the higher your dose and more days in a row the worse you will feel when you finally skip a dose.

Since we're talking about side effects I wonder if anyone else feels the ones that I do; when I take too much kratom i don't get headaches, but my vision gets messed up.  Not blurry, but more like I drank a bunch of alcohol and I have "the spins".  


If ever I throw up from kratom (only 2-3 times per year) it's not because my stomach was upset, but because of  the vertigo and the spins + double vision

Anyone  else notice that the withdrawal sweats have a unique  smell that's different than  normal sweating? Is this the same with more traditional opioids as well?

My sweat smells kinda like butter but I was told a long time ago that's just what white guys smelled like. Besides that i never noticed  any "kratom sweat" smell.


I did work construction in my 20s and my boss smoked a lot of meth..... that guy smelled like $hit to the point that we'd be working in people's houses and if they were home they'd be spraying fabreeze constantly!

The source below has a figure which suggests Indonesian kratom (Bali kratom) has the highest % of alkaloids.  Bali is the only kratom that I eat.  Red vein is said to be more "opiate like" while green vein is reportedly "speedier."  Commercial powdered leaf is my personal choice.  The effects are dose dependant, so do your research and be safe.  Hope that helps!

I'm someone that lives in mild w/d about as much as I don't. When the body sweats start it's not just the armpits and the usual stinky spots, even the sweat from my hands smells like this however once I get *well* and the sweats go away the smell goes away.

Hmm. IME indonesian Kratom was always rather stimulating to the point of high blood pressure, which I exclusively got with Indo Kratom. Prefer any green vein over classic Indo Kratom anytime. The last time I had Indo was years ago, though. I'm interested in other subjective opinions on this.

**Kratom -- Withdrawal?**


I've been taking kratom for the past two years, and sometimes my usage gets up to 6 or 7 days in a row. Recently, I decided to take a break from this nightly habit and found that a number of symptoms took place:


- restless legs
- feeling anxious during the night, but also a little in the morning
- hard to eat / somewhat nauseous


The legs I know could be because I'm used to numbing my workout pain with kratom, and so when I don't take it I can again feel that pain. Feeling anxious is kind of weird... it could be because of lack of sleep. I am worried, however, that these symptoms only seem to happen on nights when I don't do kratom. I am almost certain this is a kind of withdrawal, and it is surprisingly physical. This goes against what many say: that kratom cannot be physically addictive. 


When I would do kratom 3 - 4 days a week (even when I did it 5 days) I wouldn't get the withdrawals. It seems to happen more with 6 - 7 days straight of kratom use at night. 


Does anyone have any experience with kratom withdrawal? How did it look? 


Thank you

What are the withdrawals like for people? I do kratom at night, and I noticed that when I miss a dose I can have trouble sleeping.

I always keep a couple capsules by my bedside to take when I wake in the middle of the night.  About 1gram helps me relax and sleep.

Your experience fits in with a theory that I have ....  a list of alkaloids found in kratom are detailed on the page below

[https://drugs-forum.com/forum/showthread.php?t=195897](https://drugs-forum.com/forum/showthread.php?t=195897)


Interestingly, Mitragynine is the only alkaloid I saw that is adrenergic. Mitragynine is also the most abundant alkaloid found it kratom and it is found at a higher concentrations in Indonesian kratom according to another source I linked in an above post.   If all this is true, then it would make sense about your experience feeling stimulated & high blood pressure with Indo kratom.


So here is my theory: wikipedia states that Mitragynine is metabolized into mitragynine pseudoindoxyl, "an even more potent and selective mu opioid agonist.". I am wondering if the analgesia comes from the mitragynine pseudoindoxyl, similar to how codeine is metabolized into morphine, which is a more powerful agonist.  Except that Mitragynine is the speedy, stimulating part of the high, and then when it's converted to its secondary metabolite, that's when you get the opiated sedated part of the high.


To me, Indo kratom always seemed the most opiate like, so this seems to fit the theory.  


Thoughts?  Maybe I'm just geeking out on this and I'm way off ...

I merged your question with the megathread ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


Kratom is physically addictive just like other opioids are, so yes your symptoms sound like normal opioid withdrawal

No offense, but I'm quite surprised you didn't realize all of this is normal Kratom withdrawal and EVERYONE who has either taken too much and then stopped suddenly or even just read a fair number of threads on here knows that it's a fact that Kratom is addictive.


I mean it's an opioid..how could it NOT be addictive?!?!?


I am assuming you just never experienced these problems because you never stopped long enough to get the WDs??


Since I dont' do that much (in terms of not that many days per week..QUANTITY WISE I use A LOT)  and rarely even use 2 days in a row my WDs aren't very bad when I get them...but usually consist of serious lethargy and sleeping all day which is usually also because I'll end up doing Kratom too late and it will keep me up all night...and a bit of a runny nose and some pretty strong irritability, a bit emotional and at times some restless legs though I havent' had those for a while.


It often lasts 2 days for me, never more than 3 max.


But I still avoid actual DAILY physical dependence because I will realize it's time to stop dosing, deal with any mild WDs I get and not dose again till they are totally over.


Right now I am TRYING to take a 31 day break just to prove I can do it WHILE in possession of Kratom.


I've gone 90 days before, but I didn't have any in my house at the time, so this is a new challenge.

What would be a safe amount of Kratom to take for trying to get off a 1.5 year habit of a prescribed opiate dose staring with 15mg  mg of Oxy daily,  and the past 9-12 month of anywhere from 30-50mg a day of 15mg ER morphine and 5mg of Oxy 3 times a day all taken at once daily, instead of spread out through the day. So on a daily basis I would take both at the same time a day ranging usually 30 to 40 mg and on occasion 50mg a day. I am starting Kratom to detox off the opiates and was wondering how much Kraton would be safe to take to help with the withdrawl symptoms.

![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif)  I used Maeng Da for a short period, trying it for pain/depression.  It had promise for "numbing" me, which was welcome!  I ordered capsules from a highly recommended source (600 mg).  I worked up to 5 capsules (3 grams).  That was good for me, careful not to take daily.


**CONSTIPATION/PARTIAL OBSTRUCTION, **whether Kratom related or not, forced me to stop the trial.  I'm on Linzess 290 now for slow bowel motility.  I'm also drinking much more water daily.  I hope to try Kratom again.

I knew there were withdrawals... I'd just never had them that bad and it scared me because I realized just how dependent on it I was. Actually they were a lot better when I was doing it 3 - 4 days a week. Quantity wise I use 3 - 4 teaspoons, which is probably a regular dose. 

Right now I took a break on Fri and Sat, and then last night I did it, and tonight I am doing it again. Tomorrow I am going to get my partner to hide it from me so that I don't get tempted at night after he goes to sleep ![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif) He is really helping me to try to get things under control. I realize this is silly but I am proud of the Fri and Sat I was able to do while it was in my possession, at home, and where I could have taken it if I wanted to. 


I think it's all about realizing it may be a problem, and then controlling it. It's easy to get too liberal with kratom because it feels like just a 'tea' that you do to relax. But it can be quite addictive, I find. For me, too, it's about the time of day as much as anything. I've gotten used to having it at night. 


It's good for you that you are able to get that far with your kratom use. I am still working on it .. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png) It would be hard for me to do that many days, TBH. ESPECIALLY if I had it. You're a champ. I can only imagine the day I get there, but for now even curbing it a little to 3 - 4 days a week would be a huge accomplishment I would be proud of.. I also see it saving money, as I had begun to order every 4 weeks instead of every month and a half or so.


About the quantity... you said you do a lot at one time. You don't get nauseous after a certain point? Krat makes me nauseous after a certain point and I can't get any higher

I guess I've finally reached the point where kratom pretty much does nothing. Not much pain relief, no euphoria. I'm not experiencing much WD symptoms at all when I stop either. I know it's not the kratom I'm using becuase it was working wonderfully a few weeks ago, and I had actually started using it after taking a few days off. However, I can sometimes get mild euphoria and good pain relief with my last dose of the day. Do you guys think dosing all at once would take care of the problem? I was dosing about 2.2 grams about 3 times a day and that worked great until one day it just completely stopped working. Lately I've upped it to 3 grams but haven't seen much improvement in effect--a little more jittery but that's about it.

Interesting... I don't know.. I take about 8 - 10 grams in the evenings without doing any during the day. I didn't know dosing at 2 - 3 grams would even produce an effect or euphoria. Maybe the stimulant effect? I'd say if you want to get high on it, try doing the doses all in the evening, unless you need it to get through the day. I've had instances where I didn't get any withdrawal effects. I find the best way to deal with withdrawal effects is to try not to focus on them too much and the absolute worse thing you can do (and what I did) is beat yourself up over the withdrawal effects and make yourself feel guilty that you have gotten to that point.

I don't normally feel like I need it until the afternoon. I usually don't have much pain in the mornings and coffee works great. Also, I've needed much higher doses with the stuff I've gotten from some different vendors, so I think the kratom I have is pretty potent. I've also only dabbled with opioids. Not enough to work up physical dependence except for tramadol, but I was taking less than prescribed (WD felt 20 times worse than any kratom WD and tolerance built after only a couple days). I'm sure I would need higher doses of I had built up tolerance from extracts/stronger opioids or if i was buying  less potent kratom. 


I've read your other posts. good luck with cutting back! Pregabalin can be magical for helping with sleep during WD. And no need to beat yourself up about anything! I think A lot of people need something to relax at the end of their days. I bet kratom is healthier than overeating, drinking, smoking, etc.

I had been buying kratom from a headshop nearby until recently discovering the quality vendors online, and I am starting to get kind of worried about my use. I've been doing about two tbl spns per day one in the morning and one at night. How long does it take to build worrisome withdrawals from experience?

For any of the users like me who don't use Kratom EVERY day but try to use it sporadically, lets say, 3-4 days a week, do you ever find that you might get withdrawal FOUR days after your last dose??!!!


Like, last week and the week before, I had dosed 2 days in a row, Thursday and Friday pretty heavily, then I didn't dose at all Saturday, Sunday or Monday.


I had some pretty strong withdrawal on Saturday where I slept all day and woke up and took Phenibut which of course made me sleep even more on Sunday.


Then on Monday I felt totally fine like the withdrawal was over, but Tuesday, FOUR days after my last dose, I was feeling really shitty and ended up having to dose to feel better.


Does that make any sense to anyone???


Could I have been feeling shitty for a different reason (there are possible other reasons I don't feel like listing) or is it possible that a person could actually go through withdrawal FOUR days after their last dose, even despite having had 3 days in a row with NO usage before that???


Wouldn't it be totally out of your system by that point??

> In terms of opioid receptors, there are number of indole compounds that are active. 7-hydroxymitragynine is the most MOR specific alkaloid, followed by mitragynine and 9-hydroxycorynantheidine, which can be thought of as 9-demethylmitragynine (a partial agonist, which seems to have a longer half-live than both 7-HO and mitragynine). 7-ethanoylmitragynine, an opioid of unknown potency (at least to me) is also found in small amounts, whose half-life is probably similar to 7-hydroxymitragynine. Mitraphyline is another small component and is thought to be an NMDA-antagonist/weak opioid.

Then yes, it would be completely out of your system after 4 days.

Opioid withdrawal is usually very predictable once you recognize the symptoms, and can do a little bit of mental math with regards to 1) the dose and 2) the duration of the opioids you were taking before going into w/d.


Most importantly, it's usually fairly reliably reproducible, so if you find that (for example) kratom withdrawal is usually most intense on the first half of the first day after stopping usage, it would be highly unusual for it to suddenly be delayed by 4 days. Also, there should be physical symptoms like runny noses/excessive tears from the eye, muscle cramps, and so on for a confirmation. That is to say, usually opioid withdrawal involves more than just "feeling crappy".

Psychological addiction can be worse than physical addiction/WD symptoms. If you're dosing multiple times a week, you could be developing a psychological dependence on the boost kratom gives you. I wouldn't underestimate the power of your own mind (cliche, I know)

But they are saying I probably wouldn't have actually been going through "proper" withdrawal, while you are saying I could have been going through MENTAL withdrawal, which yes, makes sense.

Most often Kratom doesn't give me the muscle cramps and all of that but I'll feel excessively fatigued as my biggest symptom, and that's how i was feeling on that day.


However, I think it could have been because it totally screwed up my sleep schedule over that weekend because I had been up a few nights on it and that day was the first day I was attempting to return to regularity in terms of my sleep/waking cycle so my body probably felt all out of wack cause of I was FINALLY awake at a time I should have been but had been sleeping during the day for a few days before that.


So I think that could have been part of the reason.

Yes, but the two alkaloids most likely are not the only active ones, so there could probably be an active alkaloid with a half life of a few days (highly unlikely, but possible)


Yeah, 5 half lifes could be enough, but I like to be safe and use 7 half lifes ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I think A lot of people need something to relax at the end of their days. I bet kratom is healthier than overeating, drinking, smoking, etc.

Hi Slow Mobius,


Thanks, that's nice of you to say ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) I took a day off Wednesday, and I just drank a pot of chamomile tea with 3 teabags in it. It put me right out. However, I kind of let myself down because I did it more than I had planned to this week. Tonight we were having drinks, and after my first drink of course I decide to stop drinking and... go straight for the krat. So I let myself down a bit this week, but I still took 3 days off ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) I didn't want to drink because I need to get up for work tomorrow at 9 am, but I still want to have fun... so with kratom I don't have a hangover and I have much better sleep than with drinking. But I still get a little 'boost'... different feeling from alcohol but definitely makes me more social and gives a mood boost. 


Do you think so? I have thought about it. I used to eat more at night, carbs, and I think that maybe it provided a similar feeling to the kratom -- relaxation. I smoke as well but I smoke maybe a pack a week, if that. I'm not as drawn to cigarettes. I drink coffee during the day, too, when I have to go to work or go about my business. I never even want kratom during the day,

I don't get much (if any)  of the runny nose  or watery eyes  but I get hit heavy with the chills, body sweats and insomnia. Even using my go to weed and anti-histamines I'm lucky to get 3 hours. Pregabalin, temazepam and weed is the only thing will give me a full night sleep. Try taking a small dose to counter the fatigue, even 1/8 of my normal dose will get me moving although by evening I'll be in w/d again but it's worth it to me to get through work.

Hi Mobius,


Well, recently I've been doing kratom for 2 - 3 days and then taking a day off. However, I am doing a 4th straight day today and probably taking tomorrow off. There is usually a point where I get to where I don't get much out of kratom ... and then I know I need to take a break. I know I am dependent on it; but most of the time it's just something I want to do in the evening when I have time to relax. I enjoy being online and doing writing or working on art with the kratom. Not that I need it but it gives it an extra relaxation. It kind of also feels like something to sip on where beer is full of calories / sugar.


That is too bad about your family member ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png) ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png) Overeating really sucks and food can be one of the worst addictions.. because it takes a lot of physical toll on the body. Coupled with alcohol that can lead to some serious obesity. Part of the reason I do kratom is it helps me stay away from drinking too much. Usually after 2 - 3 beers / drinks I tend to want to go to the kratom. TBH I know about the shirking moderation HAHA; moderation sucksss!!! ![:!](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/argh.gif)![:p](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)

Using kratom is what helped me stop drinking years ago. I need something at the end of the day, but alcohol always seems to get out of hand (for me).  I used to drink every day but when I started using kratom I had no desire to drink; I totally lost interest!

Nowadays I might have a beer occasionally, but I never mix the two; mixing seems to give me vertigo. I actually avoid alcohol because it gets on the way of my Kratom use!

 I know what you mean.. on hard party nights I still like to drink but it doesn't pull me in as much as it used to. I don't always need something at the end of the day, but I like to have it. It's sort of an indulgence. I have gotten by without having kratom and just drinking chamomile tea at night and reading. But I PREFER to have the kratom and enjoy the free time I have at night. 


I think it's the feeling that kratom provides.. it feels more like an end-of-the-night thing than drinking. Drinking makes you hyper and makes it harder to go to sleep afterward. Krat seems to be a natural prelude to sleep..

So I know I already asked this question earlier in the thread but in kind of a different way.


Anyways, the question here this time is, **do most people think it would be unlikely for someone to be able to STILL be going through Kratom withdrawal after 4 or more days without dosing AT ALL regardless of how much you were dosing before that??


**

Today is the 4th day after my last dose which was on Sunday night and it's Thursday night, and I feel MOSTLY fine, just a little emotional.


I know I was going through some mild Kratom WD the past few days but never any flu like symptoms, just some pretty strong depression where I felt like laying in bed a lot, some fatigue and a runny nose.


Now today I am still a little tired with some mild depression.


However, I WAS consuming about an ounce a day, about 3 days a week, 4 MAX but I ALWAYS abstained at least 2 often 3 days a week.


**Is it possible that SOO much could have built up in my system that even a 4-5 day break won't get rid of it all??

**


**How much does how much one is dosing play in as a factor in relation to the half life of the substance??

**

I mean this info below says that Kratom's half life is about 10 hours and in general 5-7 times that should eliminate the metabolites, BUT...what if you are dosing an ounce 3-4 days a week vs 8 grams 3-4 days a week??


**How much of a difference would that make in terms of how much longer it would take the guy who uses an ounce for it to leave his system vs the guy who uses 8 grams a day??**


Here's the info below I found somewhere online:


"From research, we know that the standard half life of mitragynine is 3.85 ± ~1 hr, depending upon the individuals natural levels of enzymes and other factors. This means that on average 3.85 hours from the moment of absorption, half of the alkaloid is still in one’s body.


While the research has varied, it seems to point to an average half life of 2.5 ± .7 hours. The shorter half-life of this alkaloid describes why some of those who suffer from pain prefer smaller doses more frequently throughout the day, to maintain a constant level of 7-hyroxymitragynine."


So, I plan on abstaining tomorrow also and MAYBE dosing on Saturday afternoon which would be a good 5 1/2 days...approximately 132 hours after my last dose wore off.**


So on Saturday is it at all likely I could still be going through withdrawal, and today being day 4, even with dosing an ounce 3-4 days a week, is it possible I could STILL be going through withdrawal or have any Kratom alkaloids/metabolites left in my system???**

Isn't an ounce 28 grams ? So if you dose 3-4 * 28 grams it would sum up to 84g-112g a week being (just regarding the weight) equivalent to 12-16g a day. I'd say your dose regimen is slightly less harmful than dosing 12-16g/day but certainly equally or more dependency promoting as dosing your mentioned 8g/day.


As I cannot personally take pleasure of high doses I'd recommend dosing low daily over dosing high every second day if I had to recommend either or the other.

I've found Kratom to be a huge help for me when I take a long break from opiates.  I do have issues however with the duration of it.  I feel great for an hour or two then feel a bit shaky or woozy. Not the wobbles. Had that and know the difference. I'm wondering if my opiate tolerance is interfering with the Kratom.   I usually t&w about 2 teaspoons of my Kratom of choice. Usually a green or white or a blend of both in the day.  I use magnesium or turmeric with pepper as a potentiator.  Any thoughts on extending duration?

Nevertheless, I still don't have a DAILY dependency like posters on here who I've heard can't even get out of bed unless they dose and will literally wake up in the middle of the night ever night in withdrawal needing to dose to fall back to sleep and I wouldn't doubt that some of those people consume FAR less in a day than me but I'd rather be in their situation.


It's the old "binging sporadically vs lower amounts more often" argument with substances.


I'm just wondering if it is still possible to be in withdrawal after 5 days of ZERO use but no one is answering me.


Sekio answered before that he didn't think so, but I am still feeling very emotional and kind of depressed after 5 days without.


No physical symptoms, just some mild depression that I'd like to go away.


Now I'm not planning on COMPLETELY stopping till next month (then I plan on stopping for AT LEAST 6 months) but when I do totally stop, **how long do people think it should take for that depression to go away??


I mean if it is completely out of my system shouldn't I not be feeling any depression at all??**

It might not have anything to do with physiological effects from the kratom. It's common for people to be depressed without any substance issues, so no, having kratom completely out of your system does not mean you shouldn't be feeling depression. Don't underestimate the psychological effects of substance abuse. If everything is fine and dandy, you probably wouldn't be using drugs on a regular basis. That's often self medication to some degree. 


Don't you also use other substances on a regular basis? What makes you think kratom is the culprit here? I would agree with others and say physical kratom WD is extremely unlikely given your infrequency of use and the short half life of kratom's predominant alkaloids. You said yourself that you don't have any physical symptoms, just some mild depression. If I remember, you also take an antidepressant. It's not uncommon for them to lose efficacy over time.


Regardless, there's no way for anyone to say either way with certainty. The only way you can know for sure is by cutting out each substance for an extended period of time. I doubt that's the answer you want, but it's the only way you can be certain.

No, the only substances I use every single day, or at least ALMOST every day in the case of Klonopin, are Klonopin, Lexapro and caffeine.


I sometimes skip a day or two of Klonopin here and there or take a half dose certain days but most days I am on between 1.0-2.0mgs of Klonopin so I know it's not the other drugs.


Someone on another drug forum said this regarding why I'd still be feeling withdrawal after it's no longer in my system:


"You have opioid receptors in your brain which kratom targets. When targeted, opioid receptors increase the amount dopamine in the brain, which is why you feel good when taking it. When you are consistently taking kratom, those receptors start to adapt to the increase of opiates (and thereby dopamine) in the brain by downregulating, by decreasing the amount naturally released by your body. So it makes sense that you feel depressed AFTER kratom is out of your system. Your body will upregulate once it realizes that it is lacking the outside source of opiates, but this can take a little while."


I think she is right.


Even once the acute withdrawal is over it doesn't surprise me that some of the receptors could take a little longer to 100% return to normal because they have been thrown out of wack.


Sorry but unfortunately you are wrong in thinking that I am not having any actual Kratom withdrawal.


I DEFINITELY DO have physical withdrawal symptoms, most noticeably surprisingly strong lethargy and fatigue of a sort that I have never experienced when not withdrawing from something or being negatively effected by a drug.  I am also usually a lot more horny than I am when I am using Kratom and have a very low libido when using and when I stopped for the last 5 days I noticed it immediately coming back so there is that too.


It's just like normal tiredness, plus I have a somewhat runny nose when withdrawing, am more irritable and have VERY mild muscle aches.


My use is not THAT infrequent at 3-4 days a week and having used 13 out of 30 days last month and an ounce with doses of 18 grams in ONE SITTING is NOT a small amount, most Kratom users will testify to that.


BUT...most of the people on the other forum I've been going to (not sure if we are supposed to mention other drug forums on this site) are saying that with my current usage they believe I'll probably be 100% or close to 100% over all the symptoms after about 2 weeks of zero usage.


My usage is certainly not as bad as most TRUE Kratom addicts since I've never even used more than 4 days in a single week, but since my dosages are high that's a factor.


I'm lucky I have had enough self control not to dose daily, and while my plan is not to PERMANENTLY quit Kratom, I'm gonna take a good long break of AT LEAST 6 months starting within the next few weeks (I just wanna dose a handful of more times before I finally lay it down).

I've watched some videos about tapering off. I'm used to doing krat in the evenings, and when I'm doing it 6+ nights in a row (usually one dose, 3 or 4 teaspoons) I tend to just have antsy cravings at night.. I've had instances where I've felt anxious and stuff, and trouble sleeping. I used chamomile tea to taper off (those sleepy teas), but  I am considering doing what the guy on the video said, which was to slowly, day by day, take less and less. 


Also, does anyone have the experience where alcohol tends to make the cravings worse? When I'm trying to get off but it's a night of drinking for me, halfway into my first beer I'm already antsy and wanting kratom. Unfortunately, I gave in today ;(

I didn't say you're not having "actual" kratom withdrawal. You said you don't have physical symptoms, so I'm making an educated guess that your mild depression is probably not from physical kratom withdrawal. Your psychology has a chemical basis, and you alter its homeostasis on a daily basis. It sounds a like your use is infrequent enough to avoid any significant physical dependence, but the psychological consequences of affecting that homeostasis are very real and can be even more debiliatating.


Don't forget that our thoughts are rooted in chemistry. Depression is a psychological problem, but it's a very real one.

I feel you scarlet. I get that problem with alcohol vs almost any drug that I have. I tend to not even drink these days. Pregabalin is amazing for sleep without kratom if you can get it.


I don't know if you could replace kratom with kava to get off, but I find that I can use a much lower kratom dose with kava. Kava has little to no physical dependency issues IMHO

Yeah that makes sense.


I DO think SOME of the depression issues are from Kratom, but I also have depression even when I am sober and have some shit to be unhappy about, so it all factors in.

**Kratom Withdrawal**


Hi all,

I have been using Kratom for around a month now to deal with chronic back pain. My dosing hasn't been exactly consistent but on average I'd say 15grams a day. Now I'm looking to stop as the Kratom has seriously effected my performance in the gym (and bedroom). I was just wondering if anyone had any experience with Kratom withdrawal and could give me some idea of what I'm in for and what the best way to do it would be.

I think you will be fine, it's only been a month. Just start to taper down over the next couple of weeks, and then just stop using. You probably will have a very minor withdrawl if any even if you went CT. I was on some heavy opiates for about two months after surgery and just stopped and didn't have a problem. I am now a year into prescribed Roxi and morphine as I am a CPP and I just started Kratom and it is helping me taper. Did you use opiates before the Kratom? If so that might change things Some as far as withdrawl.

Thank you.. I know there are supplements I could take to help me sleep. I am going off kratom due to a forced stop.. well, a needed stop anyway. I had not ordered previously and now I have to wait about a week for it to come (barring Canada Post stoppage). I may go out and grab a bag for 25$ to enjoy on the weekend, but generally speaking that's still a 4 days break (which is longer than anything I have done currently). I am drinking a bunch of chamomile tea and am now enjoying some YouTube meditation music :D

Even though I've been on this forum for a while I still don't know the answer to this question: are we allowed to mention other forums we got information off of by name??


I ask because I've never seen anyone do it, but I know we aren't allowed to post vendors.


I am about to start a new thread on Kratom risks but I'm leaving out the name of the other forum I read about them on unless a mod comes in here and says it's ok.

I took a day off yesterday and slept OK... but my moods were on / off and I had an antsy / anxious feeling today until  I did it again. I am pretty sure I've got a problem with it ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png) I can definitely go a night without doing it, but I start to feel weird, almost like I'm getting a fever or I'm high on weed or something. The world just seems strange and different, probably because my night time consciousness is so used to krat. ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png) Binaural beats helped me last night, with some meditation. 


I may look into getting the valerian root in order to help me on off days or if I need to do a serious break for some reason... the chamomile only did the trick after 6 or so teabags.

I don't want to scare anyone, as I also LOVE Kratom, but I've started going to the Reddit "quitting Kratom" forum (It's NOT against the rules to mention other forums is it????  DELETE IT IF IT IS MODS AS I'VE NEVER HEARD OF SUCH A RULE")  and I've heard some shit that has scared me.


I'm going to be taking a LONG BREAK after I enjoy it about ten more times LOL...I don't plan on quitting FOREVER, but these people are talking about hair loss and hormonal changes and I'd like to hear from long term users and their opinions on this:


These are some posts from over there about people losing their hair, adrenal and hormonal problems that I NEVER heard mentioned on bluelight.  I don't know why some people would experience them on another forum with NO ONE mentioning them here.


It should be interesting to see how one forum responds to the different culture/reactions from another, so here they are:


"**When I was abusing Kratom I lost half of my hair. I'm a female in her 30s with zero history of hair loss on both sides of my family. When I stopped using Kratom 11 months ago, my hair started growing back when I was about 60 days clean. My hair has not recovered completely,** but it's so much better and continues to get better.

I have no scientific evidence to back this up, but I really think Kratom wreaks havoc on our glands and hormones." 


"Congratulations on two days off!! I totally feel your pain with the hair loss. **After about 6 months of regular use, my hair has started falling out more. I see it in the drain and all over my clothes, when I never noticed it before. **Especially since i'm only a 24 year old female, and all my blood work showed up normal."


"I've been using Kratom for 9 months daily. I started from 2g per dose 3x a day (1-5 months) to 8-12g once a day(last 3.5 months). **I recently cut my hair and noticed my scalp is more exposed in two areas of my head. I've never experienced any kind of drastic hair loss prior to this.** I seriously feel like this must have started just within the last couple of months.

Does Kratom affect thyroid or adrenal fatigue in some people? **There is such an overwhelming amount of information on hair loss that I figure I try this place for some input since this is the only thing that I've added to my lifestyle in the last 9 months or so."**


"First, I think that USING kratom causes adrenal fatigue, not quitting kratom. I believe that my body is now repairing itself now that I've quit. Regarding post quitting symptoms of adrenal fatigue, I was referring to **hair loss,** acne and constipation issues, NOT actual fatigue!!! Adrenal fatigue occurs when your adrenal gland is overstimulated, which I believe kratom does. Emotionally and physically I feel 1000x better since I've quit kratom. I'm really happy and optimistic. Much less tired than I was on kratom. Sleeping better than ever. Anxiety is at zero, when I was taking Kratom I was having panic attacks with increasing frequency. Again, I think adrenal fatigue is what happens when you are using kratom, not after you quit.

So I've been doing a lot of research and it seems like most of the **negative effects I experienced with Kratom can be largely attributed to its effect on the adrenal gland (low blood pressure, shakes, hormonal acne, hair loss, panic attacks, weird adrenaline rushes when falling asleep etc etc).**


"I, too, visited with an endocrinologist earlier this year when I just didn't feel like myself after nearly 9 months of daily kratom. **My tests showed a significant drop in free testosterone. My libido has not been the same since I started back up on kratom May 2015."

**


"Yes, I've experienced a lot of those symptoms and **I believe Kratom wreaks havoc on our glands and hormones. It made my thyroid go psycho.** But unfortunately even though I was symptomatic, nothing showed up on the blood work. I was discussing this with another quitter yesterday. It seems this stuff puts some of us in adrenal fatigue and affects the thyroid. I'm glad your going to the doctor. Hopefully you'll be able to get to the bottom of this.

For the most part, all of my symptoms have cleared up since quitting. **I'm 11 months kratom free, but my hormones/glands aren't quite back to normal yet.** Take care and keep us posted! ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)"


"It was thinning out all over as best I could tell. I've got really thick, curly hair so it can be hard to tell, but I didn't notice any bald spots. About 5 months of daily use, **I started to notice more hair shedding than normal like in the shower or when I brushed it. Then it got really noticeable. Scary noticeable. I'd brush my hair once, and fill the entire brush with hair.**

During this time I went to the doctor and had a bunch of tests run on my thyroid and hormones. Nothing showed up. But I have since learned that some of those tests aren't very accurate. I have a friend who has Graves Disease. It's an autoimmune disorder that attacks the thyroid and makes it go haywire. It took her 15 years to get it properly diagnoised. The reason I bring this up is not to be surprised if you get the tests and they come back normal. That's what happened to me even though I hit almost all of the major symptoms of a thyroid disorder."​

Hmm. Unfortunately this information is not very significant, as only one of those quotes contains a dose regimen. Considering the homogeneity of the reports, I suspect a bad vendor/charge as the main culprit of those adverse effects.


However, it should be common sense, that Kratom also contains adrenergic modulators. I personally cannot confirm any of those mentioned symptoms despite a short-term drop in testosterone. It seems, that the majority of the persons, that complained about hair-loss are female. Perhaps Kratom has adverse effects on the progesterone/estrogene - balance in a more draconian manner and hence females are more likely to experience undesired (long-term) effects.

Good response, and yes I also noticed most of the users complaining of hair loss are female and wondered why that was.


It's always all just going to be anecdotal.


Someone else suggested starting a poll which is a good idea but I don't feel like doing it at the moment so maybe someone else could lol.


The testosterone link unfortunately seems to be probably be true.


Perhaps it was bad vendor, we can't know for sure.


At least you aren't passing off anything I say to me being a headcase like that one poster did lol.


I really love Kratom, it's my favorite drug and that's why I want to address any health concerns relating to it.


Sweeping them under the rug is certainly not going to help anyone.


I think it's probably totally safe to use one day a week, but more than that, who knows.


All I know is I am getting to the point of needing a LONG break without being able to commit to NEVER using again because I love it so much lol.


I'm gonna finish off the few ounces I have coming in the mail and after that stop for at least 6 or more months but that's just me.

I have never lost any hair with kratom.. very weird. Drop of libido; I am not sure. Maybe loss of libido is because you've found something you like just as much as sex? Lol.

Yeah maybe it's just a weird side effect most people don't have as I've only spoken to one person on bluelight that had it happen to her, just a few minutes ago, but before going to reddit I'd never heard of it.


I guess I'm pretty doubtful it would ever happen to me but it's concerning that it happens to anyone.


The one effect I can't claim for sure is drop in testosterone, but a lot of people seem to be taking it as fact because they say all opiates/opioids lower it.


I wish someone could confirm it 100% though.

Here's a study on opioid's effects on testosterone. They pretty much all have a significant impact on testosterone, so kratom's effect on testosterone is everything but 100% certain

I think you meant it's "almost 100% certain"...just sounded odd the way you said it.


That really sucks.


But do we have any idea how long it takes testosterone levels to return to normal after Kratom use?


I mean of course that would depend on frequency of usage and dosage and probably other factors so it would probably be hard to say.


When I went 5 days in a row without last week I felt my libido was stronger, so I'm guessing it returns pretty quickly.


I also wonder how much the lowered testosterone may decrease recovery from injury or make injury more likely??


I do martial arts and don't want my body to take much longer to recover from workouts, and I've had injuries in the past.


But I doubt anyone really has answers to any of these questions.


If anyone THINKS they do, then post your opinions/facts please.

note that those studies re: lowered testosterone are with methadone/buprenorphine usage.... which typically follows a much different usage pattern than kratom, higher doses etc.

The one thing that's bothering me about kratom right now is the constipation... I have taken a few laxatives today and it helped a little, but the constipation can be fairly chronic if I don't eat enough fiber / drink water. It seems I need to eat more fiber than I normally would have. When I take a day off from kratom I get a bit of the runs though... not to be graphic..

Thanks sekio, but isn't it certain, that testosterone imbalance can be directly attributed to mu-opioid (or even x-opioid) agonism ? Or is the influence on hormones a much more complicated mechanism, that also depends on other attributes of the various known opioids ?

Low doses of melatonine (100-500 MICROgrams) plus 2 beers should also put you to sleep. A too high dose can cause nightmares, though. :D

I think I want to take at least a two day break before a camping trip I have on August 20th, so I'll be looking to do that around that time.

I like the St. John's Wort. It wasn't sedating or calming but it just changed my outlook to a positive outlook, generally

Is St Johns Wort something that works immediately or does it need  to build up in your system? I want to reduce my kratom use to just 2-3 days a week and I need something to reduce my cravings on the days that I don't.

For me when I took St. John's it worked immediately, almost an hour later. I felt elevated mood and more positivity. Although I did not have severe cravings that night, I decided to take the kratom anyway. But the cravings weren't like physical need that they usually are.

I just did some kratom but I think I'm going to take a St. Johns just to see how it interacts with it.


There's also kava kava, which can be relatively expensive... or just plain chamomile sleep tea (if you take enough of that stuff) ..

I don't know.. today I took some St. John's Wort (admittedly, about twice what the daily dose is) and I vowed not to do kratom. These vows typically never work, and I always reach into that cupboard. But today I actually feel less craving, and right now I'm sober and just tired. Do you think it could be the St. Johns? I'm also drinking some chamomile tea.

The cravings for me  are only bad the first 3 days, after that I'm usually fine, my problem is I always fall back into daily use within a week.   Chamomile tea is good, I often drink a strong cup of that or green tea while waiting for my kratom to kick in.

Its actually quite inexpensive, and you can even catch a little buzz off of it. I also find it fantastic for controlling cravings. You just have to make sure it's prepared properly or it won't do anything

I've tried Kava kava. My ex used to take that for depression and anxiety. It's not as cheap here in Canada, just like kratom is way more expensive than it is in the US (about 60$ for 150 grams). A 16oz bag of pure kava root (the gritty stuff, not the pills) goes for 30$ and I remember needing a LOT of it to feel the effects.. you mix it in milk or something. The pills are even more, running from 25$ to 35$ for a box of 120 or so. That might be cheap for some, but I got 90 capsules of St. John's for 7.99$


Eh,

 I can't say I slept well not doing the kratom last night, but I slept a bit and I'm doing OK. Don't have my usual energy today for exercise.

I fall back into daily use quite quickly. I only really break when I find myself doing 4 or 5+ teaspoons a night, or double-dosing to the point where I feel it's an unacceptable amount and then not getting much of a buzz from it. To be honest I've had nights where just satisfying the craving for krat, even without much of a buzz, was in itself euphoric... kind of like aligning my mind to where it's supposed to be (haha, so bad) ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)

Being a long time user and dependent(again) on kratom I often don't get a buzz from it by itself, for me it's more of a feeling of content but it shines with weed though.  For a tolerance break I took a month off c/t  a year ago and because of constipation issues I sometimes have to take 2-3 days  off when it gets really bad so I can  get things moving again so I'm all too familiar with the  withdrawal.  


Even though the w/d symptoms are mild the cravings  just  to "get well" generally leads me into giving in. I've gone through  much worse w/d in the last couple years than  my current, mostly once a day habit so I don't get  why I'm so mentally  weak when it comes to trying to take a break for a week or so. What's even more pathetic is I'm sitting on enough comfort meds to make it a walk in the park. ![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif)

I know.. I worry about simply craving it indefinitely until I finally have it. ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png) I can imagine myself craving it for a month if I have to. But then again I've never done that long so I don't know how the brain would react. Perhaps at that point the brain would see it more as a 'reward' rather than a nightly need.


It's difficult when you find something that feels better than virtually **anything** else.

God how I wish kratom felt better than anything else. That would solve like half a dozen major problems, at least. I usually feel good for a little while then get really sick and shakey for hours afterwards and have upset GI for atleast 16 hrs.


Also, don't worry, the craving eventually goes away. Not entirely though! I still crave drugs that aren't even made any more. I must be getting old. 8(

Yeah. I don't think the craving would ever go away completely ![:|](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eyesclosed.gif) Eventually if I went off it though I could look for other things to feel that level of relaxation.

Well it's a tree, it won't be going anywhere besides the very real threat of deforestation. You can always get plants anywhere on Earth, humans like to trade. You just have to know the right people if a certain plant becomes illegal. Apparently fresh khat is readily available in the US if you know the right people, something I learned recently. Which is a plant that has been very illegal for a long time in the US. Just an example. So I wouldn't worry about kratom disappearing, it just may become less convenient. Hopefully people will just stop talking about it and things will blow over.

They have been banning it in more states in the US the past few years. The US gets a big fat hard on for banning things. They stopped a lot of the big companies from importing a few years ago, but it was specifically targeted at the big players, not against the plant itself per se, if that makes sense. Hopefully Canada has more sense, seems like big pharma has less of a stranglehold. Oddly enough it seems the main states that made it illegal also are known for having rampant prescription drug abuse. 8)

Yes, of course... pharma companies RUN the government. Here maybe not so much, and in Canada recently they've stopped prescribing opiates / opioids because of the rampant abuse. Kratom is SO dangerous to the pharma companies. It has the potential to be one of the best natural painkillers in the world. Not to mention it can probably also act as an SSRI, an anti-anxiety and a sleep aid ![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif)

**Amphetamine and Kratom?**


Does anyone here use both?


After using vyvanse, I can't feel Kratom. 3 days off stimulants, still no effect .


All I do is lay in bed all day , zero motivation.... Feel like useless trash.....


I threw all my adhd meds in the bin, because the good effects only last a few hours and then I turn intona zombie!!!!

Save that stuff for a rainy day(Vyvanse). Stuff always doesn't just work. You need to experament with dosages before it gets right. Maybe the Kratom(doubt it) over powered the Vyvanse. Get your self stimed up, and start with a smallish dose of Kratom. That's all you can do. Experament. By the way I have plenty of experience with both drugs.

Do you still take kratom and or stims? If so, which one and how often? Thanks for your input.


I am diagnoses adhd and I can only take Amphetamine every once in a blue moon otherwise the lifeless zombie effect kicks in...I lost all personality and become isolated with obaessive thoughts.... Its pure helll..... imagine being sleep deprived and staring at the wall for hours and hours........ I am fully aware of how ridiculous the behavior is but when I take vyvanse regularly it co pletely hijacks my brain and I become OCD..... till it weara off of course.... then. Crash and sleep.... lazy for days....And this is with vyvanse the supposedly smoothest amp ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)

Amphetamine withdrawal is terrible. I've only taken amps for, at most, 2 weeks at a time (finals week). I didn't start taking dextroamp until I got a prescription in college, but it's just too strong for an every day thing, IMO. The w/d from only two weeks of constant usage is bad enough, so I feel for you man. Just ride it out and it'll get better!


Most forms of kratom already make me quite tired anyways, so I can see why they wouldn't be helping too much. Maeng da, contrary to what others say about it, tends to make me the most tired out of all of them. Have you tried switching strains? White strains tend to be the least sleepy for me, my favorite for day-time use is white vein vietnam.


I usually drink coffee on top of my kratom, as well. Have you tried caffeine for motivation or does it not work at all for you?

I've never used actual amphetamine with kratom, but I have taken propylhexadrine whilst on M. Speciosa. The crash was horrible. I was thinking that the Kratom would smooth things out, but kind of like your experience, it seemed to do nothing. Anyway-I'm going to merge this with the Kratom Megathread.

I've had the same experience with using kratom for stim crashes, but I find them extremely synergistic when taken together. 


Also with kava, you have to be super careful with how you prepare it. You have to knead good root powder in hot but not scolding hot water. Really squeezing the liquid from the powder is what extracts the alkaloids that you want. Adding milk or something fatty to the water helps. I've never had luck with T & W or just swallowing powder. It also helps a ton to chug it all in an empty stomach. There are plenty of times that I got impatient with the prep process and didn't get anything out of the batch, but I find a well prepared Batch of kava to be more relaxing than 10mg of valium

I only really break when I find myself doing 4 or 5+ teaspoons a night, or double-dosing to the point where I feel it's an unacceptable amount and then not getting much of a buzz from it. To be honest I've had nights where just satisfying the craving for krat, even without much of a buzz, was in itself euphoric... kind of like aligning my mind to where it's supposed to be (haha, so bad) ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)

I've taken Adderall and kratom together  probably 15-20  times and with meth (oral and smoked)  a handful of times, this morning being one of them. Adderall ir and  kratom is nice IMO as long as you aren't overly sensitive to kratoms stimulating  effects. Being dependent on kratom it's hit or miss on whether or not I feel it but I've always felt it 10 + hours after meth. While I've suspected that  I have ADD for some time but  was  never tested  and at my age now  I'm sure I'll never know.

I came to like it a lot even though at first I didn't.


It's weird in that if you take even a little bit too much it can make you very on edge and it feels a little hard on the body at times but if you take the right dose and everything lines up then it is a fun stimulant.


I especially liked combining it with Phenibut and/or Kratom.


I am trying to get more right now but the one vendor I know of who sells it (and who I got it from) is out and they keep saying they will get more but they said like 2 months ago they'd have more in 4-6 weeks and now they are still saying that lol.


I really don't know why it isn't more popular.

Lol yeah, well we go through the pregnancy but it's only 9 months. My BF is a very good, responsible person so I think he'd be really good at helping out with the baby.

Do you think there are any toxic effects to doing it often? I mean, on your body ? I have never really seen anything come up, but some people (especially those who aren't fans of these kind of drugs) swear there are long-term effects

Kratom really sucks for me. The effects are great while they last, but then once the buzz dies down I am left with rebound congestion/sneezing fits every time, no matter what strain I use. This sounds like withdrawal, but i only use two maybe three times a week max in doses no more then four grams. I don't use any other opiates. Also seem to feel depressed the day after using. Is there something wrong with my kratom or could I just be sensitive to the effects? Really want to keep using kratom sporadically as I have been, but not sure the drawbacks are worth it for me.

That's incredibly low dosing and I highly doubt that is withdrawal. You're taking barely enough to get high, let alone experience withdrawals. You might be over-analyzing and attributing those effects to kratom. However, in the winter time if I am sick, because I am used to taking kratom almost every night my coughing lasts longer and I have a harder time sleeping without kratom. I usually have to take codeine cough syrup (a lot of it) or DXM and tylenol just to fall asleep. So kratom can cause withdrawals, but in your case it's light use.

I don't know I feel like my kratom may be tainted or something. Could the fact I use phenibut 2-3 times a week at 1 gram doses play any part since it can act a a catalyst for kratom?

Using opiates including kratom 2-3 times each week can easily cause mild physical dependency issues after prolonged periods.

The only withdrawal symptoms I am experiencing is runny nose, congestion, hot/cold sweats, and yeah the lack of motivation and feeling down. I took a gram of phenibut today and its helping with some of the symptoms, but the runny nose is constant.


I didn't have any of these issues until I switched vendors, which is what makes me question the source. Admittedly their kratom is much more potent then what I was taking prior. Still I thought dosing 2-4 grams 2-3 days out of the week was moderate enough to not have to worry about physical dependency. 


@prescottdave: Makes sense because that is clearly what has happened. I'm shelving kratom for a long time, this has pretty much turned me off completely.

Personally I never get physical dependency issues unless I'm dosing everyday. In fact I can dose 2-3 grams once a day and not get dependency issues. It mot until I'm taking 6+ g or dosing multiple times that it becomes an issue. I've definitely noticed significant differences between vendors Cosmic. Some seen to give better opioid effects while other more stim effect. I think it has to do with how the leaf is processed

I dose about 6 grams a day, at night. It depends on how my day has been. A stressful day has me wanting kratom at night or I can't sleep too well... is it physically addictive? Honestly, I feel like I can't sleep as well without it. Now that business is picking up I'm going to look into ordering some proper herbs to help with withdrawal... maybe Valerian root. The chamomile / St. John's Wort doesn't really cut it anymore.

Yeah once you become dependent it can be a bitch trying to sleep  after 24 hours  without dosing.  Minor sleeping issues shouldn't be too difficult  or take too long to overcome. It only gets worse...as your dependency grows   you can  look forward to near complete inability to sleep during w/d. 


 Imagine laying there tired but wide awake,  going back and forth between shivering under the covers to sweating buckets. Get up to go to the bathroom and you have to change your underwear, pajamas, etc.  because they're  already soaked in sweat  just as  your bed sheets and pillow are and the night is only half over.

Man I hope I don't ever let myself get to that point.


So far it's still the opposite, trouble sleeping ON Kratom and I'm planning on stopping for a LONG time in a couple weeks after I run out of what I have.


But how many nights does that insomnia usually last for you if you simply have to deal with it and not dose??


I'm just wondering cause I don't think it SHOULD happen to me as it hasn't happened so far...but I was just wondering how long it takes for that to stop happening to you before you can sleep normally without it if you just don't dose and force yourself to deal with it.

I'd say probably within a week depending on  size of the habit, I'm just guessing though because I haven't had a long break in over a year.  I also   don't sleep naturally and haven't for years,  I use weed every night along with a rotation of downers.

That was my question, along with for how long he did it to get there.


I want to be sure not to EVER get to that point lol.


But as it stands I'm STILL the complete opposite which is I can't sleep ON Kratom and only OFF of it...and I think that must prove I'm somewhat less dependent, and want to keep it that way.

Dependency occurs at various rates for different people. But I'd suspect if you're taking it more than 3-4 times a week, you can probably expect mild-moderate wd symptoms, and if you're taking it daily for a month or two, I'd suspect you'd probably endure moderate-severe wd symptoms..

Yeah, so according to those GENERAL guidelines I'd be in the first category--mild to moderate WD symptoms.


I've usually been taking it 4 days a week, except for 5 days a week the last 2 weeks....Never more than that, never taken it 6 days a week often go 2-3 days in a week without dosing...


The question more is "how long" it takes most people at those stages to get through withdrawal.


I'm leaving myself 10 days before work starts again, which I'm assuming should be MORE than enough since a month ago I was feeling about 85% fine after 5 days without dosing.

I've been taking Kratom daily for nearly two months and my wd symptoms are honestly not very noticeable. Then again I've experienced full-on opiate withdrawal so that's my standard of comparison. I also never use Kratom at night, only morning-midday.


When I want to take a break I can usually cover the kratom absence with weed, but there absolutely is some noticeable lethargy. A moderate amount has me feeling like I've been smoking all day and I'm burned out, even if it's the only time I've smoked that day.

If you are dosing 3 times a week, even with only a 4 gram dose, it likely is minor withdrawal you are experiencing on days off that is causing the sneezing.  And the depression the day after is for sure rebound depression.  Kratom is a mu-opiate agonist, it is not much different then being addicted to a weaker opiate like codeine as far as rebound effects and severity of withdrawal symptoms go.  Check out the sub-reddit /r/quittingkratom for peoples logs and experiences quitting kratom.  The general consensus is that it takes about 30 days or so to get back to total baseline, with the first week being the main withdrawals and the next few weeks being PAWS symptoms.  


Now, 4 grams three times a week is definitely on the low side, so I'd think you'd be back to total baseline after about a week or two at most as far as mood and stuff goes if you chose to quit completely.  


But trust me guys, kratom isn't as harmless as kratom advocates make it out to be, as far as addiction potential goes.  It has been my go to for poppy tea and heroin withdrawal in the past, and was strong enough to get me out of withdrawal, so it's actually pretty potent stuff as far as opiate effects go.

And the depression the day after is for sure rebound depression.  Kratom is a mu-opiate agonist, it is not much different then being addicted to a weaker opiate like codeine as far as rebound effects and severity of withdrawal symptoms go.

What are the PAWS symptoms you'd be talking about experiencing after a week??


I've been binging pretty hard on Kratom, 4-5 days a week in VERY large dosages of sometimes up to an ounce a day, so I'm a bit worried about the withdrawal when I quit in a couple weeks.


However, usually on my off days I just experience some lethargy and depression and I try to go without dosing 2-3 days a week to lessen the addiction.


I should probably mention for reference that a month ago I went 5 full days in a row without dosing and most WD symptoms were over after the first 3 days with a little depression left on day 5 before I dosed on day 6.


**So even though my addiction is PROBABLY somewhat worse now than it was then I'm ASSUMING that the intensity of my withdrawal symptoms shouldn't be WAY worse than they were then right??**


**As it stands my plan is leaving myself 10 full days of no Kratom usage before I have to go back to work on September 1st.**


S**o my question is, even with my high doses and dosing frequency, do you think that enough of my withdrawal symptoms should be gone after 10 FULL days without Kratom that I should be able to work without it interfering too greatly (and sleep well enough the night before...after all I've never experienced insomnia but some people say it can happen...)???? 


**My job is also not manual labor...I tutor English....usually 4-7 hours a day MAX.


Also, my first couple weeks of work will be VERY light and my first day (which would be 11 days after my last dose if I do it that way) is really just an orientation.


If I quit on the schedule I'm thinking about it will be actually be 15 Full days without Kratom before I ACTUALLY have to work other than the one orientation I just have to sit there and listen to with very little if any participation on my part.


**

So does it sound to you like the Bulk of my withdrawal symptoms should be gone by 10 days before my orientation and 15 days before my actual first work day??


**Or do you think it's REALLY essential I quit even MORE than 10 days before that orientation (15 days before REAL work)???


**(Also, I am prescribed Klonopin so that could potentially help with WD and I take that about 5 days a week and have enough to take it whenever I want)**

**

I'm thinking I should probably be ok by 10 full days after my last dosage right???

I'd start tapering your dosages now, so when you hop off with those 10 days of cold turkey, you're already starting from a lower level of addiction.  I think if you do some tapering now, and then 10 days of cold turkey you should be feeling pretty baseline for work.


Make a taper plan now, like maybe 1 gram less each and every day, and stick too it.

Naw man.


I'm just quitting cold turkey.


I mean it shouldn't be THAT bad right??


Not for someone who's never used everyday, I think the fact that I go a few days without every week has my body less addicted than if I used everyday.


I mean I'm not as addicted as many other people because I don't use everyday.


If I was able to go 5 days without last month then I don't see why it should be that much harder now.


Plus, if I quit cold turkey then even though it will feel worse it should take less time to get over right??


I mean everyone so far has said that it's always just the first few days that is that bad and recently I've gone 2 days in a row without and it's not THAT bad so how much worse would it get??


I don't even have enough Kratom to do much of a taper anyways.


I think for me it's better just quitting all at once and dealing with it right away.


But what were the "PAWS symptoms" you were talking about that can last past a week??


I mean even just 10 days of cold turkey don't you think I should be fine for work at that point??


Plus like I said, it's more like 15 days of no Kratom before REAL work and just an orientation I have to go to for a few hours after 10 days.

I mean I just have a hard time believing that I could still feel like shit so badly I wouldn't be able to work 10 full days after quitting Kratom.


And what's the reason not to quit cold turkey, just because you think you'll feel worse if you don't??


I mean what's the worst Kratom withdrawals can really get if you mostly used 4-5 days a week (even at large doses??)


One guy said he got insomnia but i don't think I'd be at that point because if so I how would I be able to go 2 days in a row without dosing (which I did like 10 days ago) and still manage to sleep fine??


So I'm guessing it would just be lethargy and depression and maybe some sniffles and aches and shit like that.


I just don't see myself needing a taper for that.


It's not like Kratom withdrawal can kill you like benzo withdrawal and or alcoholic withdrawal and I've never heard anyone say Kratom withdrawal is as bad as Heroin withdrawal either.


Recently a girl on Reddit's "qutting Kratom forum" said usually most withdrawal symptoms are gone about 7 days of abstainence and that few would last longer than 14 days.


So 10 days seems enough time before an orientation with it being an actual 15 days till I really have to work.

I could definitely see insomnia being an issue. However, I could see myself eventually getting so tired of not sleeping and tweaking out that I'd pass out in the middle of the day or something.

I've never gotten it before and so I'm going to believe I won't get it this time.


And even if somehow I did I don't see how it could lost longer than 10 days.

Im a newbie to kratom although I have done many drugs in my life. I bought some kratom pills over the internet from a trusted site but still not sure if this is the best way to ingest it. Is this way ok or should I look into getting extract and making a tea like I keep reading about?

A ounce a day 4-5 times a week is a pretty heavy habit.  Kratom withdrawals aren't as bad as heroin in the sense that you won't be puking your guts out but the depression, lethargy, rls, and chills and fatigue can be just as bad.  Also, kratom has many alkaloids, so you are coming off and withdrawaling from multiple different alkaloids.  A lot of people think that the depression aspect of kratom withdrawal is worse or lasts longer then traditional opiates.  


Honestly i can't be 100% sure how you will feel 10-15 days after cold turkey.  You may feel fine, or you may have nasty lingering paws like depression, fatigue and insomnia.


That's why i recommemd you taper before jumping, because it will make the cold turkey and resulting paws much easier to deal with.

Imo pills are great so you don't have to toss&wash. I always have to gag as soon as I smell the kratom, so pills are great.

But imo it's cheaper to just buy powdered kratom and a few 00 caps

Do you know roughly how much powder you can get in a 00? I was thinking about capping my Kratom but I don't have an accurate scale (I need to get one of those).

I honestly don't even really have enough Kratom to do a proper taper and no money to buy more now.


I probably only have 3 ounces or less so any taper would be pretty weak.


I personally don't think it will be that bad for me.


Let me ask you a question:  when do most people experience most of their worst withdrawals??


Isn't it usually within the first week??


So I went 5 days in a row last month and it wasn't that bad so why should it be THAT much worse this time??


Wouldn't the WORST of the WD usually be over by 5 days, let alone 10 or 15??


i just don't see how it could last that long.


Like today I haven't taken any and I just feel depressed and a little tired.


I've never experienced insomnia yet.


It just doesn't make sense to me how I could have done 5 days just fine last month but now even 15 days would make me PHYSICALLY INCAPABLE of working.


I tend to imagine that by day 10 it will be nothing but a little depression and by day 15 almost nothing, but that's just based on my body and how I've responded so far.


Maybe I tend to overestimate how important it is that I often completely skip dosing at all 2-3 days a week but it just seems to make like if I were dosing those extra 2-3 days my withdrawal and addiction would be WAY worse than with the fact that I'm not.


But the question about how long it takes to get over the bulk of the worst effects is still my most important one, and if they are likely to be over by day 11 without and even more so by day 16 then I don't think I have much to worry about.

00 capsules can hold on average about 400-500 mg of Kratom powder when filled completely so I ordered some 000 this time (largest available). I'll see how that goes. I manually fill my cap and it's a real pain to make so many

Yeah but my use is all over the place, I'll use a few days a week to daily binge use.  My month long break a year ago I know I was dosing morning and evening quite a bit and after failing to feel 16 grams I decided I needed a break. After that long break with my now lower tolerance I came back with the expectation  of keeping it recreational but that lasted about a week lol.


First opioid  back I used was oxy/hydrocodone and very shortly after that I was back to either near daily or daily use and if my memory is correct it wasn't too long after that until I discovered  PST and started  adding  that on top of my kratom use. When the store I was getting my cheap seeds from stopped carrying them the withdrawal from that was a bitch  even with the kratom. These days my use is typically based on how constipated I am, I'll use for 4 days and w/d  for 2-3 days while I tried to get everything moving again. I got a fresh kilo a month ago and have been binging 1-2 times a day anywhere from  3-16 grams with 8-10g being the norm. 


I doubt your withdrawal will be all that bad but I would hold off on the extract until you get back from your break. Kratom w/d for me really starts after about 48 hours and is still going strong 72-90 hours after, with  the exception  of when I came off  PST and  for about a week 8-10 grams of kratom in the morning wouldn't hold me over by nighttime.  I've never done UEI but from what I understand  it's similar to coming off a true opiate.

Up to around 16 grams. Insomnia and sweating aside I find kratom w/d more annoying than anything else, I don't get the shits or throwing up that true opioids give.

I agree the 000 are the way to go..by hand packing them I can get over a gram in each one. A packed tablespoon will fit into about 7 capsules.

My month long break a year ago I know I was dosing morning and evening quite a bit and after failing to feel 16 grams I decided I needed a break. After that long break with my now lower tolerance I came back with the expectation  of keeping it recreational but that lasted about a week lol.

These days my use is typically based on how constipated I am, I'll use for 4 days and w/d  for 2-3 days while I tried to get everything moving again. I got a fresh kilo a month ago and have been binging 1-2 times a day anywhere from  3-16 grams with 8-10g being the norm.

Kratom w/d for me really starts after about 48 hours and is still going strong 72-90 hours after, with  the exception  of when I came off  PST and  for about a week 8-10 grams of kratom in the morning wouldn't hold me over by nighttime.  I've never done UEI but from what I understand  it's similar to coming off a true opiate.

That's quite a bit. I probably dose about 6 - 8 grams a night, sometimes less. But I still feel withdrawal in the evening. I basically only take it to catch a buzz at night, but I've been known sometimes to sneak a teaspoon here and there during the day on occasion. REALLY easy to get away with it, as it looks like matcha green tea. I only break when I'm hitting 8+ grams at one time and not feeling it... it's still hard.... the more you take, the worse withdrawal is...

I admit I use it to cope with negative feelings, but I also just use it for the hell of it, and it is also conducive to some of my creative projects. It makes me feel less inhibited in general, and when I'm writing I can go to places I normally wouldn't be able to access.

Yeah mega dosing and/or taking  more than one dose a day is a fast track to dependency. As many times as I've rode the withdrawal rollercoaster I wonder if kratom is like other opioids where  each  w/d intensifies and becoming dependent again happens much quicker. ![:?](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/confused.gif)

I've been using kratom every day ever since I stop my meds. I can't take a day off or else I get real depressed. I use all day, half a tsp per dose, every few hours... Its weird because I don't constipated or anything anymore..?  White Khalimantan is the strain I'm using atm, since my fav "Reds/Bali" stop working from abusing it 24/7 for months....its like I'm immune to it now, no matter how much red strain I use get no effect... So what can I do? I'm facked....

Stop? If you're having tolerance issues the most logical thing would be to ct quit or taper yourself off

I've limited myself to pretty much exclusively using it therapeutically for pain. I definitely don't catch much of a buzz from it anymore, but my WD have not increased in severerity and dependence has happened only moderately faster. I've been using for over half a year with periodic short breaks. It seems like things take a 180 when people are chasing an opioid high and using concentrates. I'm sure it's goign to vary significantly bases on your history of use/abuse

The last weekend I received an order that I purchased of green malay and red borneo. When I tried the green malay for first time (3gr, I weight 55kg and that standard dose is good for me with other strains) I felt the first 3-4 hours a kind of energy and stimulation (like it supposed to be with green malay), but after that I felt a big sedation, I barely can't move of my room.


For that, yesterday I tried with 2g, but it doesn't felt so good, after the first couple of hours gave me a strange dizziness with a uncomfortable headache that long hours, and gave me sedation too. Today I tested 1,5g one hour after eat, but this time I don't feel any stimulation or energy, yes a big sedation and relaxant effect, I would say it's very similar to morphine sedation, but without the rush of this. 


Somebody else experienced this with green malay or green veins? I know that kratom affects very different between one person and another, but I don't understand  why the first day gave me energy and stimulation for the first few hours with the double of dose, but no more stimulation or energy even with the half of that dose.


Thanks in advance

Yeah, I'm wondering if I should throw out the UEI or what because my whole plan was for my last weekend, you know to go out with a "bang" I'd dose some UEI with Phenibut and smoke weed on it and it would be amazing, since it doesn't make sense to do the UEI right now as it will make my tolerance even higher and then I'd go through what little plain leaf I have left even faster so that was the idea as to why I'd do it last.


However, that's also going to make my withdrawal even worse so do you think it's a really bad idea??


I mean it wouldn't be better to do it now would it??


As it is I've gone two days without Kratom and I'm pretty fucking depressed and sweating a lot.


I was shopping in a really cool shopping center bout pouring sweat and I think some people looked at me lol...made me pretty self conscious.


I know Pinpoint thinks I should taper, but I think I only have about 2 1/2-3 ounces left of plain leaf at most, so it wouldn't really even be much of a taper...(not including the UEI that is...)


I know the smart move is to toss the UEI, or just put it away for a really long time....but I almost don't see the point in saving it if I'm not going to do it this month.


The whole plan was to take it with Phenibut and some weed, and I don't want to save weed after this month either since I try to keep my smoking to one month a year...and right now is that month lol.


I plan on making a clean break after that with no Kratom and no weed and not much drinking for a LONG time, so for me it doesn't make sense saving the UEI, I either wanted to use it as a part of my binge or not at all.


Let me know what you think I should do.

  its called tolerannce and addiction..you need to either slowly taper your dosages down or jump off cold turkey..at this stage its pointless to continue taking it if you get no good effects..you dont seem to be taking that mmuch so withdrawals for you wont be that bad, depression and lethargy..quit now while you are ahead, dont build a bigger habit..

I would say that I agree with that but I've had recent withdrawals that were not as bad as previous ones. I hardly ever take a night off (I take it at night), though... maybe once every 9 - 10 nights of continuous use. I don't dose during the day at all, and have maybe done that once and a very small amount. I have noticed that the withdrawals are getting worse, though... business for me is a bit slow now so it doesn't help being in a bad mood ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)  But then when I'm busy (I run a tutoring business) I need it at night just to relax and unwind, Lol.

Personally I would save the UEI until after your break is over because assuming it's a good extract that's basically like throwing away some  codones and to me that's just crazy talk ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) but I'm an addict and throwing opiates away is something I couldn't  do, hell I won't even throw away tramadol.   Whenever I read of people flushing a bottle of hydros/oxy I die a little inside lol. With that said though you need to do what you think is best for you.

I haven't had a break lasting more that 3-4 days  and during those days I'm definitely  in w/d  but as soon as my bowels tell me I can use again I do.  This month since I'm not having constipation issues I've only taken maybe 2 days off so I don't know how much worse (if at all) the w/d will be. I might test it out in a week or so  for a quick tolerance break  because I'm having the urge to do some stronger opioids and don't want kratom to interfere with that. I'll drop  down to  3 grams or so   in the evening for 2-3 days before I jump off so my sleep isn't completely screwed

**Kratom Newbie**


I am totally amazed by Kratom. I tried it for the first time last Sunday while in pretty rough roxi withdrawal. Kratom stopped the WD immediately. At first, that's all it did. Now a week later, I actually get a very pleasant buzz. 


What I have noticed is that I sweat A LOT when on Kratom. Is this normal? I only weigh 120 pounds so wouldn't think I would sweat like this....I never have before. Comments?

Lol, kratom is pretty awesome.. I always get a buzz off of it, even if it's my 9th day in a row. The thing, though, is that it feels SO much better when you take a break from it and then do it.

I am taking what is probably considered a lot for a new user. I start with 7-8 grams. I tried 4 and felt nothing. Perhaps bc my opiate tolerance is so high to begin with? I was using roughly 160 mg of oxy per day for a while.

What is odd is that there is no constipation or other opiate side effects. Simply the sweating and hot flashes but I really hate that.

 I used to get really constipated at the beginning but not anymore, sadly. I miss not having to go to the bathroom.

Holy crap , that much would make me noxious as he'll !!

 I came off avg. 120mg/day oxy. For a long time ..... Weened down over like 2 weeks ( the best I could ) and started kratom while weening - but a 4g. Am / 2-3g. afternoon was enough to make it more pleasant than ever imagined ...... Now , 3 mos clean I still take but approx. 4g. / 3x day just BC I love the goodness it gives me ..... 

What strain are you using ? I've stuck to green/white mixes and never exp. any sweating or flashes - maybe you are still in w/d and that's what's going on ??

I tried Maeng Da first and it was a little too stimulating for the kind of feeling I aim for. I went to Malay next and loved it! Unfortunately, I was getting it from a head shop. After reading all the Kratom mega threads on here, I decided to buy Bali from a vendor. It came today!!! I did T & W and am feeling pretty good now. It's not quite as euphoric as the Malay so far but I dosed low until I could figure out how strong it is. I like the feeling of Bali, I just want it a little more intense.

^^^ yeah headshop prices are 2.5-10 times wholesale prices. The Maeng Da is excellent for pain relief if you take enough of it. The Bali is great too. Of course you want it to be more intense, but that is what makes kratom a miracle drug for addiction- it's lack of intensity, while still being sufficient enough to attenuate WD symptoms.

^^ You're right. I am still under the pill head mentality and Kratom is in a field of its own. I am surprised at how much of an opiate feel some strands seem to have. It has definitely helped me kick a 16 year opiate addiction. I can't complain. Cheaper, too!!

7 - 8 grams is not a CRAZY dose. I normally do 3.5 - 4 teaspoons a night, which is about 7 or 8 grams.

I'm getting Green Hulu Kapuas and it'll pretty much be my introduction to kratom, in general. I'm not going to count the couple of convenience store impulse purchases that didn't really have an effect. Has anyone tried this strain, and if so, what did you think?

wow!! reading this thread really gives me hope!. I have been on opioids for 17 years for pain management for back problems after years of dosing as high as over 250 mgs a day im now down to 115 mgs a day. Between the bs you have to put up with pain docs feeling like they control my life whether i live or not (little exaggerating) but really i dread my day every month when its time to see him. Funny thing is they preach that opioiods stop working after awhile which is bs even tho i only feel my meds if i forget to take them i no longer feel any high and havent in years but actually they still work good for my pain. Sorry for long rant anyhow im getting real close to leaving pain docs behind for kratom just worried im not low enough yet to jump without discomfort, but i have to say the day i can get kratom online to substitute for monthly pain doc would definitely be one of the best days of my life!. i appreciate any helpful info

I heard it was good. Green ones are supposed to be inbetween the white and red ones. Not too stimulating and not too sedating.

Good luck.

If it's standard "00" capsules then probably not more than a half gram.

Yup, all at once.


At one point I was even eating an ounce or slightly more in a single dose.


I just didn't really realize early on how important it was to try to keep your dosage low.


I was entirely focussed on how many days per week I dosed and keeping it to now more than like 3 days a week and for the better part of 2 years that DID prevent any real withdrawal symptoms (even now when I get them they are mild and gone in a few days) but I just went crazy with my dosing.


To be honest I don't understand how there are people who have been using Kratom for a year or more, especially if they use it weekly, who are still able to get high on less than 10 grams in a single dose.


I mean I know that if you are diligent it IS possible to keep your dose down but at the same time how do you guys who keep your doses low NOT end up having your tolerance just keep rising and rising till you need more??

That's really weird because you are NOT supposed to smoke or vape Kratom.


Have you ingested it before normally??  (either toss & wash or tea??)


Are you sure the feeling you are getting is not placebo??


I mean you ARE aware that Kratom isn't meant to be smoked or vaped right???

I've read that the heat can destroy some of the alkaloids... ok, but you never know till you try ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) Me and my buddy vaped a couple times and always felt a nice lil head buzz. Seems that not all the alkaloids get destroyed.


E: The high feels different from the usual toss&wash high and of course doesn't last as long.

I have no idea how this is happening but I have been doing it every night for 2 weeks straight and still get high off of the usual 3 - 4 teaspoons (around 6 - 8 grams). I normally stop taking krat when my tolerance goes up, but this time around it's been very good. I am healthy and I exercise and eat healthy, so maybe that is why my tolerance remains low.


I get slight withdrawals when I don't take a night off, which is why now I just don't do it.


I won't ever feel the complete mind-baffling euphoria I felt the first time I took kratom 2 years ago, for those first 3 or 4 months when my use was more spread out.. now it's a bit more like satisfying that nightly craving. But you know what... it's still an evening indulgence that I cherish. ;] Half of the fun is probably settling down to that warm tea. It also really helps with the muscle pains I get from exercise, so I just feel everything 'melting' away, and all of my day's troubles seem to go too. I suppose kratom is still doing it's job...

Which type of kratom is best for jumping off oxycontin im hoping to get dose around 90 mg a day when jumping. Also does anybody know a conversion amount for oxy mg equals around how much kratom cause im getting close to doing it after many years going everyday on oxys. And is it possible at 90 mg a day oxcy to jump over and still be able to go to work and function, one last question if i was able to jump then stay on kratom for a couple months then taper kratom. Will i just be facing kratom withdrawl or will it be worse from doing oxys months earlier.

I think bali would be a good strain as it is more sedating ie more opioid alkaloids.  You're not going the equivalent of 90mg oxy when switching to kratom, but if you do maybe 8 grams x3/day I believe you would have very minor withdrawal symptoms and I believe you would be able to function fine at work..  I wouldn't go much higher than that since you are new to kratom and would be prone to side effects if you go to high on the dosage, such as eye wiggles, nausea and just dysphoria/malaise when you dose kratom too high and aren't tolerant to these effects.   


Also when you taper the kratom you would be dealing with minor withdrawals as long as you taper correctly, and no you wouldn't be facing oxy withdrawals if you've been on the kratom for a decent period of time.

So I'm pretty new to kratom, long time opiate user though. I'd gotten an ounce of some red Bali last week, couldn't hardly stand it by T&W method....have decided to try capsules, have 50 caps red vein indo coming tomorrow. I've tried to do as much research as possible via interwebs, I guess I'm wondering how many caps equal a gram, what's a good dose to get a decent buzz?

Ok, so several days ago I discussed getting really uncomfortable hot flashes and sweating when taking Kratom. Those side effects have since gone away. It was either residual withdraw from all the roxi use OR it was a side effect specifically bc at first I was purchasing my Kratom from a headshop. Since getting Bali from a vendor, I haven't dealt with that unpleasantness. Makes me wonder what's really in the headshop Kratom. ?

Oxygal,


Some headshops actually offer fairly decent kratom, but this is not the norm - it's much more likely to find widely inconsistent quality from headshops.


I experience hot flashes and excessive sweating for the first few days Everytime I switch from another opiate/opioid back to kratom. For me, it is simply one of the side effects of kratom. After a couple days, I seem to develop a tolerance to the side effects of hot flashes and sweating... Then I am left with just the pleasant kratom high.


Seems you may have gone through a similar experience to mine.

MDPV...

I am so relieved to read someone else has experienced this! After reading thru the mega threads, I could only find where hot flashes are reported by ppl with liver damage or Hep C of which I have neither. I've never used a needle...always kept my usage to a very expensive pill-popping habit. Kratom seems to have cut the craving for anything else at the moment. For this alone, I am extremely grateful.

Maeng Da gives you energy. Red vein mellows you out and and opiated feeling, but then again, a high enough dose of any strain can have me nodding off.

I checked out some sites and watched a you tube video. This is good shit. I took 1 gram and it's straight euphoria. Full disclosure. I woke at 7 am, had 30mg of dextroamphetamine, vaped e-cig a few times, 10mg Valium at noon, 15 drops of CBD juice and 1 gram cap of this Green Maeng Da. I took it at 3:50pm ( 15:50 for the rest of you) and am now jamming Deep Purple whilst feeling euphoric. 


Very nice.


Based off the last two posts, I like the fact that one cap does the trick. I'll be responsable with this and pick up the red version for the other moods. 


Guy in the YouTube video that was most professional, said he now is into some called green Hulu kuapor. Mentioned euphoria.

I get strong norepinephrine effects with White strains. Maeng Da is milder in that regards but more uplifting which is nice. 


I know strains like  Bali/Red Vein Borneo does not have this, as it is more of a sedative.

While there may be other causes for hot flashes, I'm assuming what you guys are getting has a different name.


Hot flashes are generally for women going through menopause:


"Hot flashes: A sudden wave of mild or intense body heat caused by rushes of hormonal changes **resulting from decreased levels of estrogen.** [Hot flashes](http://www.medicinenet.com/hot_flashes/article.htm)can occur at any time and may last from a few seconds to a half-hour. They are due to blood vessel opening and constricting and a symptom of[menopause](http://www.medicinenet.com/menopause/article.htm).

**Hot flashes are episodes that are experienced by many, but not all, women undergoing menopause.** A hot flash is a feeling of warmth, sometimes associated with flushing that spreads over the body and sometimes followed by perspiration. Menstruating women in their 40's may have hot flashes, and hot flashes may last for a decade or more in some women"

Yes, and I am not female.


Non menopausal hot flashes are an excepted  symptom. Oxygal and I were correct in describing the symptom we experience as a "hot flash" though I suppose to be 100% accurate we should have said "non menopausal hot flash". I assumed this was implied.

Decided to experament a little further today. Instead of 30mg dextroamphetamine in morning, I took 15 mg of dextroamphetamine and one gram of Green Maeng Da. It wasn't half bad to be honest. I was mainly interested in decreasing norepinephrine effects.


Easer to control mood. ( yesterday was fine, but easier to have a flash of anger ). 


Tomorrow, I'm going to give this a break. I took today's combo around 11:00am. I currently have a few different substances in my system. Overall feeling good now. Clean mental feeling. Decent combo. The duration on that gram could be a little longer.

Me too, actually. I like most of his videos and I can tell he's most likely a bler. 


By the way, a very easy way to take Kratom is to mix it in with unsweetened applesauce. I've found out that the less applesauce you mix in, the better it tastes. I made the mistake of mixing 5g of Kratom with about 12 tablespoons of applesauce and it, although not nearly as disgusting as the toss and wash method, was pretty rank. You want to mix in just enough unsweetened applesauce to make an oatmeal like consistency and the taste is very tolerable. You may or may not want to mix in some additional applesauce, if it does taste bad. But I have found that less is more, when it comes to making it easier to ingest.

I can definitely see how this stuff can be psychologically addicting even before there is physical dependence. I received an email this morning announcing I have a package arriving today. Suddenly I don't have the "Monday blues" as much. 


I think this is a wonderful little plant but I don't want another addiction. I plan on proceeding with caution from now on.

I'm finding out that Kratom has to be treated seriously. I like it, but would not want to be strung out on it. I get some fire, take only what I need and that's all. So far, one dose a day. 


I am experamenting with one gram of really good kratom and 30 mg of dextroamphetamine. I tried it with 15!mg d amp and 1 gram of Kratom. I liked it, had decient energy, but lacked that amphetamine effect.


Today, I'm trying it all, because I like the energy and the clear mental effect.


Side note: the Kratom gave me a mental effect, similar to methylphenidate.


This Green Mang Da is nice. I am going to try different strains to compare. I am open to suggestion aside from the couple I have already recieved. I like euphoria and pain relief, without getting really wired. Good day all.

It sounds like you have the same goal as me regarding Kratom. I'm not into the stem effects as much but just enjoy a mood lift and, as you described, the sharper mental focus. I am a little surprised 1 gram is enough to produce effects for you. Didn't you say you have prior opiate tolerance/experience?

8) I tried Kratom powder (in capsules) last summer (2015).  It was recommended for my pain and the suicide level depression that rides shotgun to the pain.  I ordered the Maeng Dai for uplift/stimulation.  


Really LONG story, but basically my GI shuts down with pain meds.  There's little I can do for my pain, unless I give up my career and go home to medicate and wait for death.  So...I'm assessing better options to deal with the depression.  I'm a tough little chick, but decades of HURT have robbed me of my motivation and "give a shit".


Back to the Kratom...I found that it "numbed" me emotionally (no anger or sadness).  I just felt "smooth" if that makes any sense.  It allowed me to keep up my façade of "I'm good" for a couple of hard weeks.  We lost one of our darling Dalmatians just days after my birthday.  It broke my heart, but the Kratom kept me together.  It kept me calm whereas I would have otherwise lost it.  I actually thought perhaps I was in shock, because I wasn't crying inconsolably. 


Hindsight tells me it was not shock, but benefits of Kratom I'd taken.  I thought holy shit...I've found a miracle!


I had to stop before I really got started, as pre-existing constipation advanced to a partial bowel obstruction.  I have no clue as to whether the Kratom made my tummy troubles worse...or if it was just coincidence.  


Anyone else experience constipation from Kratom?  I'd be taking it NOW if I didn't fear obstruction.  


Meanwhile, I'm trying MMJ which doesn't seem to be the answer, either.


Something's gotta give...before I give up.

Kratom can lead to constipation so if you already have a pre-existing issue with that then yes, it made it worse.  Have you tried laxatives or stool softeners and increasing the amount of fluids you consume each day?

Hi,Dixichik! I read your story abiut your battle with Endometriosis. You have gone thru hell and back. I'm glad the kratom helped. I recommend "Bali" / "Red Vein Borneo" strain to numb emotional and physical pain. If constipation is a problem, try some of the "White " strains, it does not cause me constipation, in fact I usually have to go #2, 20 mins after dosing. "Maeng Da" is basically somewhere in between those two strains, red strains/Bali is the worst for constipation. Your bowel issues sounds serious. Have you considered Anal / Rectum surgery?  You are an inspiration to us blue lighters!

Kratom is really difficult to get physically addicted to. It takes months and months of daily dosing to even reach that point. You have to seriously put an effort and dose like crazy to get addicted to this stuff lol

I took kratom 24/7 for a couple months and got off without problem after I ran out. Maybe I had some restless legs and sweating the first night, but after that I was good. My only problem is a high tolerance to the "Bali/red" strains from abusing it too much. But addiction is near impossible imo. There is a "ceiling effect" at higher dosages, where it just makes you sick and nauseous. This protects us from over doing the kratom.

I have the same from it.. Like I can be depressed and feel nothing on it. It's great for stress or anxiety or anything like that. I can feel nothing on it. That's what I love about it.


I must be an anomaly on all facets kratom. I don't get the constipation. It seems to do the opposite for me. But, I am also weird and get munchies on it where most people lose their appetite. Eating kills the buzz though, so what I do is eat before I take it and then I can go hours without killing the buzz.


I'm an anomaly on all drugs though. Weed makes me extremely tired and paranoid so I can't smoke any unless I'm at home and ready to go to bed. It sucks because I always decline when it's offered. Everything affects me differently I guess.


After about 3 days I no longer feel the stimulating effects but I feel the numbness in emotions which is why I always want to take it. I find that I can keep a buzz going if I skip 2 days between 1-2 days of taking it.

i have had bunk Kratom before. I take my medicine seriously. I can officially say that new stuff I got is fire.

I take a few different medicines. I know way better then to get strung out on it. But honest to God, it was the best I ever had.

After some research, I want to find a smacky opiate feeling one with low stim effects. I don't know, but any kind I get, will be fire.


I have opiate experience to the point of railing 20 mg of oxymorphone. That got me so high, I was snoring. So the farthest I got prescribed was 20 mg of oxymorphone ER a day. That shit can kill you if you don't have the tolerance. But I withdrew off it in 10 days with a few days of minor anxiety. No side effects.


Sorry folks, I must say. Don't get emotionally wrapped up in your medicine or let it mess with your head and you will be fine. That might not sound easy to do, but it is. It's all in your head.

Hmmm...maybe my vendor isn't as good. I think my product is decent but I can't describe it as fire. I guess I may have to experiment more with different vendors and different types of Kratom. Lmk if you discover a smacky one with low stim!

Well I'm taking a several month break but I just hope SOMEDAY I can actually get high off less than 10 grams again.


Most of you guys would probably be SHOCKED at the mountains of Kratom I would sit there and toss and wash...we are talking about 14-18 grams to get high.


I'd just weigh it all out, put it on a piece of paper in front of me and one after another take about 8 or so teaspoons straight into my mouth washed down with about 2 bottles of water.


Usually it would seriously take me a full 10-15 minutes to swallow it all to the point where sometimes I'd even start to feel some effects BEFORE I finished swallowing it all lol.


But somehow my stomach is just able to tolerate it.


I wish early on I'd learned to keep my tolerance low, but I never really got that lessen, only the one about not doing it more than 3-4 days a week which thankfully helped my WDs to never really be THAT bad.


Last time I took a 90 day break it got my tolerance from an ounce a day to 14 grams a day so MAYBE if I take 6 or more months off...as I plan on doing....I could actually get my tolerance back to 10 grams or so.


One thing I've found is that Kratom tolerance is hard to lower when you get to those super high doses.


Maybe i could also experiment with those methods of putting it in water and swallowing it, but at the doses I was taking I would have choked on it so that wouldn't have been smart.

^ I guess if that is your  preferred way of doing it. 


Mixing 8 grams in 8 ounces of V8 juice TWICE I could have that down in 10 seconds, 30 if I'm swallowing capsules.

Hmmm, when I EVENTUALLY do try Kratom again I may have to attempt that, just with not too much at once.


I don't want to choke on that shit and Kratom could be pretty easy to choke on if you take too much at once.


I'd definitely rather not be sitting there taking all that time to spoon it all in if I don't have to.


But unfortunately I think I need to wait a good 6 months or longer to use Kratom again.


It's actually TOO GOOD a drug IMO to the point of making me complacent and at times lazy...except when I'm on it I'm not lazy, but I refused to take it every day (wisely IMO) so the off days during even MINOR WD were just too complacent for me to get enough shit done that I need to do.


It's almost like Soma from Huxley's Brave New World IMO.

I go back and forth between capsules and mixing in liquid, when I can't handle the gritty   taste anymore I'll switch over to capsules for a while.  My favorite is V8 juice, the thickness of it makes it perfect to cover up the grit. I can use OJ or just water and sugar up to 4 grams but above that the grit is too much.

Not for me.  What I've noticed is  that I can do 4 grams twice a day every day and not get constipated much  but 8 grams once a day for 3-4 days is constipating causing me to  only drop marbles. ![:?](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/confused.gif)

You're a habitual user Lysis negative side effects tend to fade. Also opiate munchies are a documented thing you can do a search on it it's usually a craving for sweets I get it too. Although you are right that unlike most other options kratom is a true appetite suppressor.

Anyone find their libido tanks on kratom? I don't have this problem on other opiates (morphine, Hydromorphone).  But take a lil bit of Kratom, and u can say bye bye to libido lol. My guess is that kratom has anti depressant effects unlike traditional opiates and affects more neurotransmitters than we think.

Idk, it's weird. I'm new to Kratom (2 weeks) and I've found certain kinds suppress my appetite and the kind I have now actually gives me the munchies. No kind, so far, has caused constipation. Actually, the opposite. That's a side effect I don't like.

![:!](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/argh.gif) **I guess the poop is always "looser" on the other side!** 


IF ONLY the Kratom would give me the squirts...then I wouldn't have to spend $250 per month for Linzess 290.


IF ONLY I could numb the pain and desperation that is my life.  I can continue to my futile efforts to save the world!  


($250+ per month for Linzess?  YES...that's outrageously expensive. YES, I've done it ALL to pass poop for 30+years. YES, folks *would pay this *if ALL else is failing.) 


**In defense of Kratom:**  As I said in previous post, CONSTIPATION for me is pre-existing due to disease/surgery/trauma.  Perhaps it was coincidence (not Kratom) that I suffered the obstruction. I loved the mood lift! 


**HYDRATION **is a must, either way.  I can't drink enough liquid to keep hydrated! I liked that the Maeng Dai didn't increase appetite.  I don't like to eat.  It hurts too bad!

You're not going the equivalent of 90mg oxy when switching to kratom, but if you do maybe 8 grams x3/day I believe you would have very minor withdrawal symptoms and I believe you would be able to function fine at work..  I wouldn't go much higher than that since you are new to kratom and would be prone to side effects if you go to high on the dosage, such as eye wiggles, nausea and just dysphoria/malaise when you dose kratom too high and aren't tolerant to these effects.

thanks for the info, i was wondering how long can i do 7 or 8 grams kratom 2 to 3 times daily after jumping off oxy without having to face heavy kratom withdrawls. I do plan on staying on kratom long enough that i will have to taper from it, the main reason i want to stay on kratom so long is i want to make sure my LONGTERM oxy use is gone out of my system for sure before i stop kratom

That's the thing though.. it's not like you feel nothing, is it? It's that you feel GOOD; you feel positive emotions. It's not exactly numbing. It's a pronounced and deliberate mood lift. This is why I don't like the characterization of kratom as a 'numbing' agent. It has sparked my creativity at times, has made it easier to put pen to paper, has made me more socially comfortable.

^ This. I don't feel numb, just a better version of myself with more energy, a mood lift, and more motivation. I like who I am without it, however, it's nice to have as a perk now and then.

This mood lift that you're talking about is exactly why I am starting to get worried about my Kratom use. I've never been addicted to a drug, but Kratom I could see myself taking everyday. When im on it im the version of me I want to be. I feel how I want to feel, and it's worrying me. I just swallowed 7 grams before class, why did I do that? I don't need drugs for school, but I did it anyways. Sigh. If i can't get it under control myself, I might have to have my girlfriend intervene. But yes, Kratom has a MAJOR mood lift for me. Difference between ️night and day

Both of you are pretty much describing my attitude toward it too. It depends on perspective -- yeah, something is capable of lifting your mood and making your day / night (or both) better, but why should that be a bad thing? I'm OK without krat too... but it just gives that little bit extra. it does probably cause structural changes within the brain in terms of your dopamine, but so do a number of other things: coffee, cigarettes, sugar. And it's not something you can't cut if you really wanted to.

I think I've read some people say that Kratom use diminishes sex drive. Is this with long term use or just in general? So far, it actually kind of puts me in the mood. I took Prozac for about 9 months several years ago and it totally destroyed my sex drive. Just don't want that same side effect....

Low dose is libido enhancing. Medium/High dose numbs too much, so is counter-indicated.


Of course it is also strain dependent. White vein batches are more likely to induce hornyness than red vein (standard Bali,Borneo) strains.

BTW I am really not an opiate user but have a high tolerance, like 20mg oxycodone is barely something to me even if I didnt touch opiates for more than a month.


Thanks for your time.

I would choose green vein strain for your purpose. It is generally the perfect allround type of Kratom (also dependend on the country of origin, there is Borneo Green Vein, Mindanao Green Vein, Bali Green Vein, Sumatra Green Vein, Vietnamese Green Vein etc.). Red Vein feels too much like an opiate, it is rather boring and too sedative. White vein is the worst choice for as an aid for muscle cramps. It rather exacerbates cramps and can also cause a mild panic attack in stimulant naive persons. Maeng Da is some sort of White and Red Vein. It is sometimes hit and miss, because the dose-response curve is steep with maeng da. From a certain point you just get very nauseous.


Perhaps also a 50%-50% mixture of red vein and green vein works in your case. I personally dislike red vein as it is not really utilizable. White vein is sometimes too stimulating even for an abuser of synthetic stimulants.


To sum it up : First start with a green vein.

That's good to know. I've been favoring Bali and haven't really tried anything else. Maybe I should branch out a little.

Ziiirp Thanks for the advice ! I am planning on alternating between Kava (mixed with chamomile and Lemon balm), Kratom, (Low benzo dose with low lemon balm and green tea), cannabis and then Lyrica and start the rotation again. To avoid tolerance to any of those.


As for kratom I will probably use a mix of Red and Green 50/50 it sounds like a good idea for my specific issues. Are extracts worth using or simply plain material made in a tea?

It was a long time ago I last made tea. Usually if you plan to brew a tea, you should buy crushed leaf instead of powdererd leaf (but powdered leaf also works). If you buy powdered leaf, you commonly administer via the toss and wash method, i.e. putting an amount under the tongue and then washing the powder down with some juice/cacao.


In your case I would probably measure out an amount of green vein powder, let's say max. 2.5 g + an amount of red vein powder, also max. 2.5 g and then washing it down in 2-3 heaps. Maybe start lower, if you have really high quality powdered leaf (happens sometimes ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

Well, I had my first experience taking too much Kratom yesterday. Worst. Experience. Ever. I got jittery and anxious. And then nauseous AF. I thought Kratom was nasty going down. Coming up? Horrific. I will definitely be more mindful of my dosing from here on out.

Yeah, there are strains, that are not forgiving in that regard. :D But I don't like high doses anyway. Low/Medium dose (3-6g) green vein is my favourite.


I never puked from Kratom, but if you accidentally get some powder in the trachea, you'll spit everything, that's in your mouth against the item standing next to you. In my case it was a white wall and a mirror. Pure art.

You mean in that art session ? I am not sure. But you have a point, Green Malay tastes more nasty than average green vein, it is more voluminous.


Generally I'd claim, that I already tried any plain leaf - type. Extracts and enhanced stuff I only tried a couple of times, not my cup of Kratom tea.

Malay is a very all-around decent strain, just ordered some after I tried out the sample I got in my last order. I personally like mixing reds and greens and the occasional white together. Broader range of alkaloids and all that.

Thanks! I know it's been discussed in the Kratom thread before...some say whites are more stimulating and some say the green ones are. I guess it's just totally subjective and I won't know until I try! I think Maylay is gonna be my next purchase. I haven't been feeling the Bali as much lately.

A white strain from my experience but I haven't taken a  white since  I first got into kratom,  and with an almost no kratom  tolerance it could of been that I was just sensitive to the stimulating effects that kratom has. 


If you can handle the taste and texture I would mix it in water, orange juice etc. I personally like V8 juice the best with OJ being second. Kratom does NOT mix well in cold liquids so what I do is first use only hot water and use just enough to cover the kratom, the hot water will allow it to mix in instantly then fill up the rest of the glass (I use 8 ounces) with the fluid of your choice and chug it in one breath.


Option 2-  Capsules, I use  the 000 size and  can fit 1 gram+ in them. 


IMO mixing it in liquid seems to work a little better but being a daily user I can only deal with the gritty K-mud for a week or two before I have to switch over to capsules for a while.

DEA just announced its intent to use its "emergency scheduling" powers to place Kratom and its alkaloids in Schedule I next month: [https://s3.amazonaws.com/public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2016-20803.pdf](https://s3.amazonaws.com/public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2016-20803.pdf)

Absolutely, utterly infuriating. The only thing this accomplishes is ensuring more people stay hooked on heroin or pharmaceutical opiates and maintain the statistics that keep the DEA funded year after year.

this is beyond infuriating, and i have never used kratom but have been very interested in it for a long time.....for me this is the last straw on having any sympathy for anyone who participates on the war on drugs willingly, not informants who have been exhasuted due to addiction and just an overall lack of support and proper conditioning by the system and then being terrorized and forced into indentured service by the use of blackmail of taking away what little freedoms they have, or threatining their children or loved ones, losing their jobs by being "exposed".  I understand that this has been going on for way to long and that this is also not the first time they have did something like this, but has i said this is the last straw for me, anyone with any sense of decency should quit working for vice related leo has a protest, other wise fuck off you deserve no place on american soil, not even good enough to reside in prison because their are alot better people than you there...so any pigs just keep your fucking traps shut in any response to this thread and stay the fuck off this board.  You are worse than worthless in my opinoin and nothing you could say could justify this type of behaivour anymore (other than i quit)....get on board or get the fuck out!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


edit: and dont try and construe this has any  type of threat, i would never harm anyone in any way, you are not worth my fucking freedom or integrity....but once again go fuck yourselfs, i hope you lose every bit of sleep you try to get.

and dont try and use the argument that your saving peoples lives by keeping drugs off the street, and taking bad horrible gangster drug dealers off the streets, thats a fucking joke, you and your bosses are the direct reason drug prices are so high that people have to choose between medication or food, or rent. You and your bosses are also the direct reason those same bad horrible gangsters are in buisness any drug user picks the best plug they can find, the nicest, the most decent, the one with the best and most affordable medication. Fentanyl is rampant cut in supposed heroin and killing people everyday BECAUSE OF YOU, people are being murderd every day over drugs BECAUSE OF YOU, people are being cut off of prescription medication or not being allowed access to it at all BECAUSE OF YOU and alot of you or your peers and i know you know this is a fucking fact enjoy all of this occuring, its completley fucking disgusting and a disgrace to everything this country should stand for. People in this country should be able to have easy access to medication that betters their lifes cause we are the ones breaking our fucking backs supporting it, and if allowed we could produce any and all drugs we needed on our own if you wouldnt get in the way of people taking care of themselves........like i said before this situation is beyond infuriating for me. yeah addiction sucks but it could be dealt with in a way easier fashion if we were treated anything like how a human being should be treated, educate yourself before you try and tell others how to run there own fucking lifes because obviously this system is almost completely devoid of any means to do it for us.

Wow, I'm really fucking pissed right now. Schedule I, what a fucking joke. But I'm not at all surprised, I knew it wouldn't last much longer away from the clutches of the DEA. Now me and everyone else who medicate with it are fucked. This is a real shame, Kratom really helped me.


I'm sure it's gonna be hard to enforce that though. I'll find a way to keep getting it eventually.

Kratom is fairly easy to stop. That's the whole point to me. I was on painkillers and dope (hard to stop) then subs (impossible to stop) then kratom (easy to stop) then nothing.


This shit was the key to ending my multi-year opiate addiction.

OBVIOUSLY.


I just signed that petition but do you think I could be arrested for having done so or monitored by the government for it??


Is there any way any of us could stock up enough in ONE MONTH to have a real supply??


I mean I feel like I never should have gotten into it in the first place.


Like I literally fell in love with this plant to have it taken away from me.


It helped my anxiety and depression more than any drug I've ever used.

I havn't written a letter to a politican in about 3 years because I just did it out of emotion but I realize they don't give a fuck about anyone except big money.   I actually got several sympathetic replies saying they agreed with me but basically couldn't do shit about anything.


it came from kratom cutting into big pharmas profits too much and kratom lowering the number of heroin ODs and arrests.

I took  a full dose today since it was done  before I heard the news but tomorrow I'm starting a rapid detox to get my tolerance down. Physically I know I can deal with  but  the mental aspect I'm really worried about because  between the cravings and the  thought of not being able to dose when I need it is already doing  a number on my anxiety.

I'm sorry for people addicted to it.


I'm not, but I recently stopped just to take a break so I could focus on some other things.


I like Kratom so much that I don't know about my ability to moderate if I have a massive amount in my possession but if it's that or nothing...well I'd rather have access.


So 3 more questions for you guys:


1) For us ordering Kilos now...will we be arrested or will the Kratom be seized if it's not illegal YET??


2) And will there be ANY possibility that Kratom could eventually become available on the street like other illegal drugs have so we could buy it off your usual scumbag drug dealers??


And one more question for those who order Kilos:


3)  Do they actually fit in your mailbox??


Or do they drop them at your front door or in a large P.O. box at a post office??


How much space exactly does a kilo's worth take up??

Ordering kilos now will be no different than before since it's still legal just don't get caught with it  after next month. With kratom being dosed in grams I can easily see a possession with sales charge and with it being a schedule 1 it would  probably be major jail time.   


I live in an APT so all large orders go to the clubhouse and get  locked up until I come and get it but a kilo would/should  fit in a standard house mailbox.


My last kilo came in an 12.5" x 9" envelope.

Ok but if I get it before a month from now I should be fine?


What if it's on it's way to me and doesn't get to me before it's made illegal???


Also, can I ask them to send it to a P.O. box at my post office instead of my house if I want?


And i know you dont' know the answer as does anyone...but what do you think the chances of it ever becoming available on the street are??


I looked at the DEA document and it SEEMS to criminalize SALE and distribution but doesn't say anything about possession being illegal so would that mean we could order it from outside the country and be ok??

I would imagine some kratom vendors would move to other, less legal means of distribution. I have hope that it won't disappear forever. But I mean just look at every drug haha you can get anything SOME way.

> Stock up. I ordered 2 kilos as soon as I got the news...this is on top of the half kilo I already have. I may order one more in 2-3 weeks if my vendor  still has some left. I took  a full dose today since it was done  before I heard the news but tomorrow I'm starting a rapid detox to get my tolerance down. Physically I know I can deal with  but  the mental aspect I'm really worried about because  between the cravings and the  thought of not being able to dose when I need it is already doing  a number on my anxiety.

I think even if it was still in shipping when the ban happened you would probably be fine because I know with my vendor at least who is in the states doesn't say KRATOM on the outside of the package. I would be very careful ordering outside the country because at best they simply confiscate the order at customs or it could go really bad and  they send an officer posing as UPS driver and arrest you when you take delivery. As silly as it sounds kratom will be classed the same as heroin. Just look at what an ounce of marijuana will get you if you get caught.


I think it will be very slim to find it on the street unless  you got the in's with a vendor or headshop owner with left overs and willing to sell  under the table.

Guys first of all, I am so sad for all of you in the US but I have a feeling this will catch wind in Canada too.

This is a travesty and a violation of rights, particularly to those who have benefited so much from it. Obviously this is an attempt to support the pharma companies in the continued sales of opiates, benzos, etc... I am so sorry to all my krat brothers and sisters in the US.

I am actually going to write a letter to the president of the US.. I don't care if I am Canadian. I am so outraged by this.

I'd gladly pay big pharma but I can't even get tramadol prescribed to me even with a MRI showing I have legit back pain.


I recently went through around a half kilo in a little over two months but my use will be drastically reduced. I plan to try to keep my use to  16-24 grams  a week.

I've never opened one but I'm assuming you could just ask them to send packages there instead of your house right??


Not having it come to my house would be a better option for me.

 To me this is not only a violation of freedom but of human rights -- namely, the right to the fair access of a medicine. I kind of made up this right, granted, but I believe in it. This is a violation to the highest degree. And it's STUPID, too, because most kratom users are not drooling and homeless on the street with IV's of green liquid shooting into their arms.


They are for the most part more functional than potheads , and those who do kratom all day in small doses use it to HELP them contribute to society by eliminating or lowering depression / anxiety. The DEA will see how stupid this is, don't worry. And that's the great thing about this thing: in small doses it can lift mood, and larger doses get you too high to function. So most people are forced to balance it out and dose appropriately.

They are well aware...they know that this will cause a huge return to heroin use and increase profits for pharma, the increase in illegal heroin use will help them keep the jails full, creating another mechanism to siphon tax payer dollars into the personal accounts of private corporation owners which pay the bribes to congress.

Hey, I live in the south U.S. Lol. Seriously, this sucks bad. Kratom ended a 16 year roxi addiction for me. I mean, immediately arrested the cravings and withdrawal and I haven't looked back. I'm doing better than I have in YEARS. I am pissed AF right now. Do y'all think this will last? I mean, for Christ's sake, we recently legalized weed. Surely they will revamp this BS.

I think this really is the last straw and a sign that I need to get the fuck out of this country. Drain my bank account, find a job and a place in Canada and never look back. Clearly there is no place left in this country for rational people.

I'm doing better than I have in YEARS. I am pissed AF right now. Do y'all think this will last? I mean, for Christ's sake, we recently legalized weed. Surely they will revamp this BS.

It will last. The problem is, once a plant or substance is made illegal there is really no avenue or pathway that people can go through to make it legal again. It took decades and millions of arrests to overturn the cannabis laws. It will be the same for kratom most likely. Decades from now, it may be overturned as public opinion sways even further against prohibition, especially the prohibition of natural plants and drug policy finally changes. But that wont be happening any time soon.

I dont understand what your problem is, if you want to get rid of it just put it in a dumpster, throw it in a lake, dig a hole and bury out in the woods or burn it.No one is going to bother you about it unless you do other types of illegal activity and if you really dont want to keep it at your parents house you could rent a public storage space.

You'd personally feel safe dumping it in a dumpster with the possibility that it could be traced back to you??


Would you dump several kilos of heroin in a dumpster and not be nervous that someone would figure out it was you that dumped it there and arrest you for 25 to life??


Afterall, that amount of a schedule 1 substance would be considered trafficking.


I don't know, it's my anxiety disorder acting up.


I want to stock up, but part of me feels like I'll end up with this huge illegal burden on my hands.


I guess I'm just fucking neurotic and that's one of the things this plant has helped with.


Maybe afterall it would be good for me to NOT stock up and just let it go forever so I'm considering that...I mean there's only 2 options there, to stock up or not.


I mean it is just a fucking drug afterall.

I would not be afraid to dump a kilo of heroin in a dumpster. How would anyone figure it out it was me? and if they did, I would say I was keeping with the law, getting rid of it. Id say it showed up in a package at my door step and I didn't know what it was, but thought it looked suspicious so I got rid of it. But if youre not comfortable with a dumpster, burn it or bury it like I said. 


Also, just because its schedule one doesnt mean its the same as heroin. For one a kilo of heroin is many more doses than a kilo of kratom. For two, a kilo of heroin is much more tied to illicit activity because you cant obtain it legally. Its not the same as buying something that is completely legal and then (unbeknownst to you wink wink) having it made illegal. OR you could simply say "I bought this kratom, then saw a news article about it being illegal now, so I decided to get rid of it".


I mean, seriously, how can you be charged for getting rid of something that was legal when you bought it? You would be complying with the law by getting rid of it, not breaking the law.

I don't know, throwing a kilo of heroin in a dumpster seems a bad idea to me but maybe you are right.


I'm remembering that movie "Return to Paradise" where Joachim Phoenix dumps some hash in a garbage can in Malaysia and the police find it and he gets hung for it lol.   That movie somehow kind of messed with my head as a drug user.


I see your point about having bought it when it was legal, but how could you ever prove you bought it when it was legal??


Cause for the sake of argument, I'm even talking about like if I bought a whole bunch of kilos and then a whole year from now or even further ahead in the future I decided I didn't want it anymore and dumped it.


I don't know...the "it showed up on my doorstep" excuse seems like it wouldn't hold up in court.


I know this is kind of far fetched, but it just makes me uncomfortable.


I guess burning it, burying it, or little by little throwing away small amounts of it at a time or throwing bits into bushes in my backyard or a forest back that's back there would seem like a better idea since who would really ever distinguish Kratom powder from dirt if it was all mashed up in their with grass and leaves and the wind was blowing so much of it away?


Probably over a short period of time there'd be none of it left if you scattered it all around the woods as if it were just ashes or something.


Kratom powder is obviously extremely fine and dirt-or sand-like and doesn't smell much like anything other than ground earth IMO so that would probably make it easier to get rid of.


But I just don't know, somehow I can't get this out of my head or let it stop bothering me.


I'm not sure if I should just let it go and say goodbye to Kratom for good or not.

You're not going to have your door kicked in for Kratom unless you advertise you have some bricks or commit some other crime.


If you have it in your closet, don't mention it and don't sell it you're good.


I would wager the majority on the board have at least once had some type of illicit substance in the home, and I would also wager the vast majority of them have not had their door kicked in.


I've known many drug users IRL. Generally the only busts are traffic stops, snitches, and selling drugs to DTs. At which point the door gets kicked in.


Don't sell drugs and don't ride dirty and you're pretty much OK.

I tend to agree with your contention that, in this specific case, the ban will last.


There is precedent for an emergency ban lapsing and a substance becoming legal again, though. IIRC this is what happened with ephedrine, which was emergency scheduled by the DEA at one point, only to have the restriction lapse a couple years later. (But correct me if I'm wrong.)

While it's true the chances of being caught are unlikely, I personally am not so comfortable having several kilos' worth of a schedule one substance in my house and the thing is, it puts my family at risk also without their knowing.


Also, I forget who it was that said "you can't get in trouble if you bought it while it was still legal" but I HIGHLY doubt that is true.


Why should it matter what it's status was when you bought it??


If you still have it once it's illegal then you are committing a crime.


I'm more and more thinking I don't feel so comfortable stocking up.


I feel like maybe I should just say goodbye to it.

25 years in prison for a 1 month supply of a drug less intoxicating than weed or beer...land of the free.


many citizens of this country believe that u deserve to do life for having a kilo of kratom....meanwhile they get blinc drunk, drive, beat the shit out of their kids.  


 in the phillipines they would shoot you like a dog in the street even on suspicion.

My thoughts on this are how are they going to know that it's kratom unless it labeled?  To my knowledge there isn't a field test  like there is with heroin, coke, meth etc. and it doesn't have a strong odor like weed. If you're really worried about it I'm sure you can find some bulk containers at an herb and supplement store to keep it in.  When I've gone out of town for a couple days I  carried my kratom in a valerian root bottle just in case.  Even though it was legal why take the chance at getting hassled having a mysterious powder in an unlabeled container.

Funny little thing about the odor and appearance; kratom looks and smells *very much* like henna (an Indian plant used for dying hair and skin). I have both, so if worst comes to worst, I can just say it's henna.

Exactly! I doubt 99% of cops have even heard of kratom.


I've worked  with a couple  opiate addicts, one who currently is on suboxone and until I told them about kratom  they  never even heard of it before.

Man, I hear what you are saying and everything, but more and more I'm thinking I can't put my family at risk.


Now I told my brother about it and he's begging me not to stock up either and since he knows about it (even though he's never taken it) he'll end up knowing if I do and give me shit about it.


Family pressure like that is hard for me to resist.


I personally know it's pretty unlikely I could ever be caught, but I just don't know anymore.


I've become a bit too obsessed with Kratom as it is so maybe it really is just a sign that it's time for me to say goodbye to it.


It makes me SOO depressed the idea of never being able to take it again, but I just get so obsessed over shit like this, I almost wonder if it's even worth it anymore.

I hear ya on being obsessed with it and while I am  physically dependent, my mental dependency on it is on another level.

BTW, kratom has kept me straight. But now that it's going to be illegal, I will most likely cave in and go get some H when I get a craving. Thanks POS DEA! This is the biggest bunch of horseshit.

You know the Bible actually says that God gave man every plant. It also says there are no destructive drugs (referring to natural plant drugs of course as there were not pharmaceuticals in that day and age)


For he fashioned all things that they might have being,


and the creatures of the world are wholesome;


There is not a destructive drug among them


nor any domain of Hades* on earth,


first chapter, Book of Wisdom (note some protestants will reject this book)


So according to the Bible, kratom is a medicinal plant given to us by God and we have a God given right to use it. Prohibition of plants is completely unChristian. Nowhere in the Bible does it advocate prohibiting plants or making any part of God's creation illegal. All the plants were made for a good purpose and when used with prudence and care, will yield health benefits to the user.  Why would God make a whole bunch of psychoactive plants with proven benefits and then want us to outlaw them and put people in cages for having them? It doesn't make any sense from a theological standpoint.

^ This. Come mid October I'll probably weigh 105 pounds again with my nose dribbling down to my chin. Subs didn't work for me and neither did MMT. For whatever reason, Kratom has worked. I'm not physically dependent bc I've only been using it for a month. But when a craving hits, I dose it and go about my day. That's why this blows so much. Grrrrrrr.

subs made me depressed and made me feel like I was still a junkie just using a massively inferior drug.  the problem for me with opiates is that they numb my emotions making me not really care much about anything except my next opiate fix. kratom doesn't do that, it allows me to live a very normal life and experience my emotions in a healthy way. Its so much of a better drug than heroin or suboxone. 


oh well, i guess we still have poppy seed tea and thats not going anywhere because poppy seeds have legitimate food use.

I haven't bought pods in a long time, back when you could buy a shitload on e-bay. Are they still easy to get? Any vendor recommendations you could PM me?


I will avoid pods as much as I possibly can because they're probably more addictive than anything given the fact that they contain ALL the alkaloids. I used to love them but they are way more dangerous than kratom.


This is going to screw a lot of people. Kratom was my go-to substance. It's just perfect in every way. I don't think I would've been clean for as long as I have been without kratom (yeah, I know I'm not "clean" in the NA kind of way). I only take it 2-3 times a week, but it's enough to keep me from shooting H.

What the hell is an EMERGENCY SCHEDULE?


Oh, I'm sorry... people are laying in the streets, drooling, completely messed up, with no jobs because of kratom and this is an emergency. Meanwhile, you guys have a potential president who originally starred in a reality TV show. I'm sorry, no offense, but Rob Ford looked bad for only so long before Donald Trump.

If I'd live in the states I probably would buy millions of Kratom seeds and dispatch them in the wild in the US. They don't look suspicious when grown (like a little Birch/Akacia maybe from the eyes of a novice) and they don't smell, but they are not as stable as Weed plants/trees, meaning bugs will likely invade them if one does not pay attention.


Anyway you have so much fertile land in the center/southern states, that it is worth a try.


My condolences. US is worse than Russia soon regarding domestic policies.

Used kratom for the first time today, Took it about 3 hours ago, I understand why you guys who live in the US are Mad about it becoming illegal !!! Its an awsome plant! Gives 3 things energy, relaxation and concentrations, all that keeping your mind off too complex things when they dont have a practical use !

They won't know what it is just by sight, but it looks suspicious enough for them to test. Especially if you look the part.

There are drug tests for kratom and a field test now that it's schedule 1 is worthwhile for a company to put out on the market.

33,000 signatures already and we need 100,000 by September 29. Probably won't do a damn bit of good even if we do get the signatures but at least it's *something* we can do.

No, not cocaine but the coca leaf yes [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2...s-drinks-coca-leaf-tea-on-south-american-tour](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/09/pope-francis-drinks-coca-leaf-tea-on-south-american-tour) even the pope drinks coca leaf tea. 


Natural plant psychoactives, are God-given and not harmful when used prudently. When they are stripped from their natural form and made super concentrated, like heroin and crack, then they become a lot more dangerous and lose much of their sacredness.  Jesus's first public miracle was turning water into wine and there are many verses in the Bible where people drink wine without any negative connotation whatsoever. It's abusing it, drinking to excess, that is considered sinful. The same logic should apply to kratom as far as I am concerned, moderation. 


And yes I agree self denial and asceticism are certainly a big part of Christian spirituality but that is not the same as a prohibition against using psychoactive substances (which simply isn't there). And yes, the Bible does say to be vigilant and sober but I'd argue there is good reason for being vigilant and sober in this world. I am not saying the Bible is supporting the average stoner lifestyle of waking up and getting baked and then having kratom for lunch or whatever. I am just saying that there is nothing in the Bible that should forbid a mature Christian from having access to whatever plants they wish. St. Paul says“ Everything is permissible for me,” but not everything is helpful. “ Everything is permissible for me,” but I will not be brought under the control of anything."


So the edict is against abuse, addiction and unwise use of substances, not substances themself. On the contrary, all things are supposed to be lawful for the Christian. No one has the right to tell the Christian which of God's plants he can and cannot ingest.


I think there is an assumption among Christians that psychoactive plants are evil or of the devil, but my point is that there is no Biblical bases for this view.

I just discovered that Paxil (SSRI) blocks the effect of Kratom. I can't feel a thing ever since I started Paxil. Last time, Kratom stopped working when I took paxil, but I thought the problem was due to tolerance. Gonna throw it in the bin


If you are taking antidepressant medication, research to see if it affects the CYP2D6 liver enzyme. Most AD affect that liver enzymer so you must dose higher. Paxil is the worst as it blocks 99% of kratom effect.

I don't think I would've been clean for as long as I have been without kratom (yeah, I know I'm not "clean" in the NA kind of way). I only take it 2-3 times a week, but it's enough to keep me from shooting H.

I said poppy SEED tea dude, not pod. I haven't bought the pods in years either, I see sites selling them but I have been leery of purchasing any. The seeds on the other hand are perfectly legal to buy and shouldn't raise any eyebrows.

Is there any other drug or combination of drugs (and it ALSO has to be safe to mix with Lexapro and Klonopin) that could produce SOMETHING like the effects of Kratom which is also RELATIVELY safe and not SUPER habit forming??


And when I say that, I don't necessarily mean an opioid so think outside of the box.


More what I mean is, a drug or even a MULTI drug combo which together provides the following:   Relaxation but also stimulation with a feeling of well being and mildly pleasant body high WITHOUT TOTALLY incapacitating you or making you non functional.


And beyond that, I will also accept seperate answers for a drug or drug combo that DOES get you too fucked up too go out in person on it BUT it still does the rest of those things.


For example:


The closest thing I know so far is the combination of Prolintane and Phenibut which is VERY nice.


I don't know how great it is for you BUT the few times I got the dosage of the combo right I felt confident and stimulated from the Prolintane yet relaxed from the Phenibut and though it still wasnt' the same as a Kratom high it provided many of the same benefits.


The combo of Dexadrine and Phenibut also worked well for the same reasons.


Then of course, is the ONLY drug I really like better than Kratom which is Shrooms but living where I live I can never find them BUT I swear to god ONE DAY I am going to really learn how to grow them and grow myself a SHIT LOAD.


I don't usually get visuals from shrooms but what I DO get is a TOTAL and COMPLETE sense of inner peace as if EVERYTHING is right with the world and Kratom is the only other thing that gives me that except shrooms does in fact do it even better.


So if I were to combine a mild stimulant like Very low dose Prolintane or Dex with Shrooms I think I'd get everything Kratom gives me of course with the exception of NOT being able to go out in public much on it.


And then people talk about Tianeptine but I've never used it.


How good is Tianeptine, how safe and how habit forming and how much does it feel like Kratom??


Also, can Tianeptine be safely combined with SSRIs like Lexapro and Benzos like Klonopin cause I take both of those.


I know some people say Tramadol is like Kratom but that SERIOUSLY interferes with SSRIs so I won't touch that.


Or are there any other RCs out there even or other drugs I might not know about which provide that kind of "speed ball effect" WITHOUT being SUPER dangerous.


That feeling of "inner peace and release from anxiety" along with MILD TO MODERATE stimulation??

What you're asking for is another OTC opioid, and nope, there is nothing of the sort. Kratom was the last bastion of the euphoric sedatives, I'm afraid.


Tianeptine is another opioid but it seems to be easier to form a dependence on that than kratom [[e.g.]](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19801742), and it's also harder to source as you're not going to find it in headshops. It also lacks the stimulating effect that kratom has as it doesn't have any adrenergic activity.

Well i said it doesn't need to be an opioid, and that it could even be a combo of drugs which combines to create a feeling of well being with it being anxiolytic and relaxing, but also stimulating.


Like I said, though the combo of Prolintane and Phenibut didn't REALLY feel like Kratom, at the proper dosages it had many of the same benefits of it being relaxing and stimulating at the same time.


I don't know if you could ever find them in the same drug (though Phenibut is a bit stimulating but not like Kratom), but I'd have to assume there's SOME combo, even if it's 3 drugs, that could produce a state of well being even if not exactly LIKE Kratom...still having those qualities.


Like I said, my last shroom trip was VERY relaxing and I bet if I'd thrown in a low dose stimulant it would have been even more satisfying than Kratom.


I mean I'm sure there ARE some kinds of drug combos providing something akin to what I'm talking about but they wouldn't really feel like Kratom.


This is really an injustice and yet one more way for the government to just strip people of their rights, but there's a billion other ways it happens every day.


I will NEVER EVER understand why drugs, ANY drugs, even heroin, ever became illegal in the first place.


The war drugs has not only NOT worked, it's been HORRIBLE and created  SO much MORE crime.


BUT....I guess whether or not it has "worked" depends on what you stand to gain, and if you work for the DEA or branches of government which stand to gain MONEY through the war on drugs, or work for the prison system, then you'd probably consider the war on drugs a MASSIVE success because it's made "the right people" TONS of money.


I guess that's it at the end of the day:  few people REALLY care about saving lives or "protecting us from ourselves"...it's all about money, and if that is your marker for success, well than I guess the war on drugs has been an astounding achievement of money making destruction.

I mean is there really ANY chance this gets overturned??


They say it's "temporary" but I think that's bullshit.


I'm guessing there really isn't, that somehow the DEA just decided they'd heard too much about people getting high off this stuff and by god it had to stop!


Fuck it.


I mean in a year's time, probably much less, Kratom will be nothing but a fleeting fond memory, something that probably doesn't cross my mind very often, but I still wish I'd never discovered it just 2 years prior to it being banned.


There really was no point in getting so into something and suddenly having it taken away.


But boo fucking hoo.


Life goes on I guess.

Also, I know most won't care about the answer to this question, but I'm just wondering for the sake of argument, what is the status of Kratom's legality in Amsterdam in particular, as well as a number of other random cities in other countries and other countries in general?


I ask in particular about Amsterdam because of course they are so lax with weed and USED to have legal shrooms (they fact they don't anymore is retarded) and when I went there 12 years ago I thought it was FUCKING PARADISE.


If there's any other country/city I'd ever consider moving or at least going back to it would Amsterdam/The Netherlands.


I'd IMAGINE that Kratom is still legal there correct??


If so, who knows, maybe someday a long trip there might make it even more worth it than just the weed and the beautiful city alone already do.

Agreed. Amsterdam (or other towns in the Netherlands) is the best city in the western world. Okay, I would probably get annoyed by the party/sex tourists after a short time, but nonetheless, there is no better place to go in the so called west. That the drugs aren't illegalized does not mean, that everyone is high all the time, which would be lame.

What could be a potential replacement for kratom, at least to help wean off of it? I was thinking possibly about kava kava or Valerian root. Valerian root can be purchased for quite cheap.

Kava and Valerian could help a tiny bit with kratom withdrawal, but not a whole lot since they don't hit opioid receptors. I personally used DXM to help come off kratom, though in a way it prolonged it, I still had to go through some days of uncomfortable,sleepless,shit-feeling. Thankfully, I haven't used kratom in quite some time as I always ended up addicted and while nowhere near as bad as being on strong opioids full time and also not near as bad coming off, it still totally sucked.


 That said, this scheduling of kratom is idiotic and another back assward step in the futile and horribly damaging war on drugs. I mean I knew it was inevitable, and just a matter of time, but I am very glad it is actually being fought somewhat and not taken lying down. Kratom has helped a great many people, and even if it hadn't, the risks involved go nowhere near justifying it being scheduled as a controlled substance. Give me a fucking break.

You would need the support of NA to end that fight. By the way, do any of the bigger anti drug groups support Kratom. Who Are Kratoms medicinal supporters. Maybe if you could get a few health departments at medical colleges to be frank about the safety profile while it is still unscheduled. A couple people throw together a letter, that we could submit? I'm sick of misinformation bullshit.

Apparently there is a whitehouse.gov petition against the scheduling of kratom that already has over 30,000 signatures. Also, the american kratom association is raising money to hire lawyers to file lawsuits, pay lobbyists and things of that nature.

We need to use mass media and heavy HR awareness of Kratom and all of its natural beauty. Show how the side effects are rare when used properly. How people are able to avoid unpleasant withdrWal in a natural, self medicating way. Misuse has to be on the way out now. We all clean up our act and image and hopefully much more support for a almighty cause.

im sorry but its pointless to go against a special interest (pharma).


look at guns....90% of americans favor increased background checks...90%...gun lobby prevents it from happening because it will hurt profits.  what percentage of the population even knows what kratom is 0.00001%?


you are not free, we need to get that through our head and accept it. your the property of the government.  they will only act like they care what you have to say but will do as the lobbyists wish.

Unfortunately I think its too late for this to have any bearing on the temporary scheduling, but I wholeheartedly agree that people need to focus on responsibke use over the next 3 years. The only problem is that the DEA will probabky cone back in 3 years and say something along the lines of "scheduling mitragynine  has reduced ER visits associsted with kratom use by 70%. Therefore, mitragynine will remain a schedule one substance"


Cannabis is schedule one because there arent clinical trials demonstrating it's medicinal benefits, and there wont be clinical trials because its a schedule one drug. Catch 22! And even if someone somehow managed to pull something crazy out of their ass that proves kratom is medically beneficial in the next month, it will be a heavily regulated schedule two drug. 


Kratom's best chance is something similar to how kava went from legal to illegal to legal in the EU. Our best bet is to encourage research outside of the US (ie safety studies). In that case, there's at least a chance we get it back in 3 years when the DEA's decision is reviewed. 


Stock up for the long winter people!

Even if it reached a million signatures , the white house has a tendency to ignore these petitions. Their response is usually "Thank you for bringing this to our attention" and you will never hear from them again.  Its such a joke. Time to move to Canada.

Can I ask, - if you had a 30 gram per day Kratom habit - lasting almost 4 years, the majority of that period at a lower level, somewhere around 15 grams per day, having ramped up lately.  Would you taper or CT?


I'm in Canada so I'll still have access for the time being, but I can sympathize with all my friends south of the border in for a rough ride if you're forced to quit using.


I hate it now, I get no pleasure from it, just have to take it every 4 or 5 hours or I start feeling WD's.  I literally cannot remember what it feels like to wake up in the morning without WD symptoms starting to kick in.  


I got laid off a couple months ago so I don't have to work.  Broke up with my GF a month ago and am in a place where I don't really know anyone all that shit kind of magnifies the negatives of being on Kratom to me, compared to when things were going better in life.  I went a little over 24 hours without it, about a month back and it was really rough, mentally mostly - world seems so bleak, I failed to stick to it.  But I just feel like my life is becoming drug addicted bullshit, I'd love to go travel and do something cool shake up my life a bit but I'm tied to the leaf.  Like I'm 30 now it's just ridiculous to keep going with this.


I've been tapering a bit, and honestly, I find that even a really shallow taper, like a gram or less per day - I just feel a low level crappy feeling all the time.  Nothing like major suffering, but just enough to make it not really enjoyable to do much.  I don't know whether I'd rather go through that for a month, or just fucking CT and sit around crying and writhing around for a few days or however long it takes and be done with it.  I find the mental aspect just so hard to get over.  My optimism for life is pretty weak at times as a guy taking 30G/day of kratom, I'm worried things'll get really scary after a couple days of WD.

unfortunately there is no easy way off of opioids....you either do a taper and feel like medium shit for a month or two....or go CT and feel like extreme shit for a week.


i did a taper off of my scripted fentanyl over the course of a month....i felt like shit and like i was withdrawing the entire month....when i finally jumped off totally dose was so low it was not bad at all...almost no withdrawal (actually felt worse during points of the taper).


You have to really want it...otherwise the temptation of having opioids around is too great to not take enough to feel normal.


i also had no job or responsibility of any sort during that month...so this made feeling terrible the whole time possible.


no easy solution.....try dxm do help lower your dosages while still feeling more normal...this worked for me.


it was so worth it. the freedom i feel of non being dependent is incredible

I don't even think I'm going to stock up because I'll run out eventually and just be even that much more into it by then and I started to get a bit too obsessed with it as it is, but I found out it wasn't even very addictive for me at all and even using 4 days a week about 14-18 grams a day all I had was 4 days of mild depression and a runny nose.


IT"S A SAFE SUBSTANCE!!!


And in the end I just get REALLY REALLY angry, not even just about Kratom but the entire war on drugs and the DEA and all of it.


What fucking chance is there, not only of Kratom becoming legal again, but of the ENTIRE war on drugs just STOPPING, at least in just ONE country of the world???


I'm not even talking necessarily about America, I'm talking about JUST ONE country, ANY country, where ANY AND ALL drugs, whether they are Kratom, weed, Shrooms, Heroin, meth, LSD, whatever...are ALL decriminalized???


IS there even ONE country in the ENTIRE world like that???


The best countries/cities I know of in terms of drug laws are Amsterdam and Portugal and even they have MOST drugs illegal don't they??


I mean I'm not sure about Portugal.


What is the status of hard drug like Heroin and Meth over there?


Amsterdam has legal weed sure, but they pussed out and made shrooms illegal again cause ONE person jumped off a bridge on Shrooms, and they have some clinics for Heroin addicts but STILL even over there they probably imprison heroin and meth and even shroom dealers or people caught with a lot.


WHEN WILL JUST ONE COUNTRY HAVE THE BALLS TO SAY THEY WILL HAVE ZERO DRUGS LAWS!!!


Why can't we just say that if you are fucking 18 years old and NOT driving a car that you can take whatever drug you want because it's your body?!?!!


I know I'm just ranting but it makes ZERO sense.


Drugs only cause crime MOST of the time BECAUSE they are illegal and hence linked to violent crime inevitably because criminals control the drug trade.


Make them ALL decriminalized and available at your local CVS and nearly ALL the drug crime would ABRUPTLY stop.


Sure, you'd still have overdoses, but I bet you'd have FAR fewer.


But it doesn't matter cause Big Pharma, the DEA, police agencies and prisons stand to gain SO much money from keeping drugs illegal there's no way we can win this war.


The only way to win essentially, or at least fight back, is either petition and try to fight legally, but that doesn't usually work, so then the best way to "fight back" becomes simply figuring out a way to not get arrested and do whatever drugs you can get your hands on, as most of us here do.


We hence become criminals, but the best we can hope for is not to get caught by the evil fucking overlords who will imprison us and ruin our lives for hurting NO ONE.

I have to ask people though:


WHY do you all think that the DEA just decided to "temporarily" schedule Kratom??


The only explanation I've heard is to try not to "upset" people too much and then announce that it's permanent later but I'm not sure I buy that because why would the DEA really care that much about upsetting Kratom users?


Such a small percentage of the population even knows what it is let alone uses it.


And the saddest thing about it is that unlike more popular drugs like weed, shrooms, LSD, and harder drugs I don't use like Meth, Heroin, etc...Kratom never had enough time to gain enough popularity before it's banning to ever be likely to be available on the street afterwards.


All those other drugs had time to gain solid enough followings that after they were made illegal they continued to available due to demand.


It's a pretty sinister move by the DEA--Nip it in the bud BEFORE Kratom becomes popular so that it will vanish almost entirely from Western society.


I HEARD that Thailand decided to remove it from scheduling perhaps in response to what the U.S. did, citing that the war on drugs has failed.


IF so that's an AMAZINGLY open minded move and I would applaud them.


Is there any truth to that rumor???


If so, I wanna go to Thailand lol.

It is because they have a meth-addict epidemic there and Kratom as a soft drug can be used to wean you off of it. It is the much lesser evil. In that regard Kratom is really a superb substance cocktail, as it can be used for opiate and stimulant wd likewise. If one does not intend to imitate the effects of other drugs then Kratom is really a medicine on par with cannabis (considering the absence of the need of processing it contrarily to many other plants).

I still want to know why people think the DEA chose to only temporarily ban Kratom.


Why would they care about upsetting Kratom users?


I don't buy that as an excuse.


Is it because they MIGHT decide to patent it as a medicine?

I've read some post that quitting Kratom for only a week resets tolerance. Can anyone tell me if it is really that quick? I know with traditional opiates, it can take months to lower tolerance. I'm just curious what other's experience with this has been. I am taking a break until this weekend and wonder if my tolerance will be lowered that quickly. Thanks!

Depends on the dosage. If you never took more than say 8g/day, then after a week your tolerance will be reset (perceptively) completely.


If you take higher dosages, the period of abstinence should be longer.

I went a little over 24 hours without it, about a month back and it was really rough, mentally mostly - world seems so bleak, I failed to stick to it.  But I just feel like my life is becoming drug addicted bullshit, I'd love to go travel and do something cool shake up my life a bit but I'm tied to the leaf.  Like I'm 30 now it's just ridiculous to keep going with this.

Nothing like major suffering, but just enough to make it not really enjoyable to do much.  I don't know whether I'd rather go through that for a month, or just fucking CT and sit around crying and writhing around for a few days or however long it takes and be done with it.  I find the mental aspect just so hard to get over.  My optimism for life is pretty weak at times as a guy taking 30G/day of kratom, I'm worried things'll get really scary after a couple days of WD

I an new to this forum. I just recently bought some kratom which I have not started taking yet. I am gonna start taking on Wednesday on my day off work. I am currently taking methadone 10mg 2 tabs a day & xanax 1mg a half in morning & half @ night & have been taking the xanax since 1994. I use to take a lot more than I am now. Is the kratom gonna help me with the WD's or should I taper down on the xanax? I was told if I went cold turkey off xanax it could kill me. Can someone please give me some advise on what I should do? Really would appreciate any help of info I can get. Thank you.

I live in Florida & I just bought some Kratom on Saturday from a smoke shop & I asked the store clerk if it was going to be banned by the end of the month & he said not that he is aware of & he showed me the large amount he has to sell so I'm not sure if it is gonna be banned or not. The Idea can't stand that Kratom helps drug users & there scared its gonna take profit from the pharmaceutical. Its insane if you ask me.

It is definitely going to be banned for at least 3 years due to emergency scheduling. After that, the DEA will revisit the issue. Hopefully, it will end up like the ephedrine ban and pass once the emergency scheduling has expired. Doubt it, but possible.

Yeah it is gone. Shouldn't be hard to get on the black market tho, it's legal in Indonesia and canada, ect.. I wouldn't think it would cost much more on the black market. Suboxone is still gonna be cheaper though, as it is now, per mg equivalency.

Do you think it's popular enough to actually make it to the black market? I just can't see ppl "dealing" Kratom. I think I'm just gonna have to accept its gone (for a long time anyway). 

Is Kava any good? How does it compare to Kratom? I want to find something else legal I'm happy with because I REALLY don't wanna go back to f*ing oxy. ?

It's going to be banned unfortunately and if I were you I'd tell him to look it up online so he doesn't get arrested.

You REALLY think it shouldn't be hard to get on the black market IN THE U.S.???


I REALLY HOPE you are right but I very much doubt it.


I mean it will certainly be much harder to get if available at all than your typical illegal drugs like weed, coke, heroin, even shrooms and LSD.


Maybe if you have really great connections and know the right people but I only know your typical drug dealers and I don't think I'll be lucky enough to find it again.


I wish I could, but I have to be honest with myself.


Maybe someday it will make a comeback, but I don't even think your average drug dealer in the U.S. who sells other shit has any idea at all what it is.


Maybe in other countries but not here.

I am now 24 hours in on my first break from Kratom after using for 6 weeks. I have to say that unless I take a turn for the worse suddenly, Kratom is very forgiving (at least initially). I do believe that long-term use would probably cause extreme psychological withdrawal that have the potential to be hellish. Even tho I have zero physical symptoms, not even a runny nose, I feel very slight anxiety. That could probably definitely get worse over time.

I get very very mild physical symptoms for maybe a day or two at ~12 g/day. Just a couple days off helps alot with tolerance for me. It's really different for everyone. I think the psychological aspect  (depression, lethargy) is the worst but even that is relatively mild. 


Good luck!

Also the DEA only temporarily  scheduled mitragynine because temporarily scheduling is the only thing currently within the scope of their authority. The idea is  to allow research ti catch up before letting people use the drug, but in reality, they're putting the brakes kn research by scheduling. Also, in the next few years they'll probably fund some abuse studies at hand picked laboratories. People will say that kratom is pleasurable, instant schedule 1 since there hasnt been (and won't be) extensive clinical trials for an FDA approved medicinal benefit. In America, anything that is remotely pleasurable is also illegal without a doctors prescription.

Haven't looked back too far but the DEA has requested to ban Kratom effective September 30. This is truly f'ed up considering UNADULTERATED Kratom is relatively innocuous compared to being stuck on opioid pain meds. I actually feel human again. So anyway without complaining too much just wanted to give folks here a heads up to A) sign the White House petition----


[https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/please-do-not-make-kratom-schedule-i-substance](https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/please-do-not-make-kratom-schedule-i-substance) (over 77,000 signatures so far!)


and B) If you can attend the Kratom March on DC Tuesday September 13---


[http://kratommarchdc.com](http://kratommarchdc.com)


there's a Facebook group named Kratom (New and Current Users) that's on fire with more information.  PLEASE take some time to review this info. We need all the help we can get!!!

Guys. First, I hope the head shop owner I dealt with will not notice the schedule for a while. He gets fire. Anyway, I am at a loss for words, to why the fuck this is getting scheduled. The shit will go grey. Become friends with your local connect. I would want at least an ounce of this shit. More like 4oz.

I became such a slave to the stuff, I would start to feel bad within 5 hours if I didn't take it. Sweaty, dialated pupils, muscle aches, and I would wake up in withdrawal in the middle of each night and need to take more if I wanted to go back to sleep. So the time has come where I want to stop, totally. I don't take any other narcotics or drink, nor can I use drugs to withdrawal. I somewhat tapered the best I could and then stopped completely about 24 hours ago. I got some immodioum, some St. John's wart, and some other mood supporting supplements. I managed to sleep last night but had vivid dreams, was a little restless, and this morning I feel ok but very tired and weak. Is this going to get worse or have I expected it to be more intense than it really will be? How long till full withdrawals kick in, if at all? Any experience with doing this would be much apprciatated. Thanks!

> As for the withdrawal symptoms, consider your own body and its desire for equilibrium. Shocking the body into withdrawal isn't a good feeling, so you need to do this gradually. This substance was popularized as a maintainence herb for opiate withdrawals. Start tapering your doses by half, and keep a healthy diet with pleanty of nutritious foods and fluids. Try to go as long as you can without drugs before re-dosing. You want to stop your dependence, so you'll have to distance yourself from the substance that put you into this state. Don't back track, if you haven't taken it for 2 days, don't go back down to 1 day, go to 3. If you haven't taken it for 12 hours, don't go to 6, bite the bullet and go to the next day. Your body will make you feel bad, but consider it as your body fighting to bring itself back to equilibrium. It'll take a while for your body to return to equilibrium, but if you shoot for a healthy lifestyle, and try to make it a reality bit by bit, step by step, you can overcome the physiological dependence within a few weeks, then work on the psychological dependence. But both go hand in hand. Keep a strong determination for fighting your urges and replace them with productive activities (exercise? conversations?) Something that'll stimulate your mind and distract you from your vice.

Hey guys, I made a request to get a front page article in the Support forum without much response. Feel free to chime in if you think we ought to have something on the front page about this sudden scheduling:


[http://bluelight.org/vb/threads/802...-the-ban-on-Kratom-and-a-link-to-the-petition](http://bluelight.org/vb/threads/802639-Can-we-get-a-front-page-sticky-about-the-ban-on-Kratom-and-a-link-to-the-petition)


At this point, any exposure we can get would be helpful and would say things look hopeful that there's a viable challenge to this scheduling.

About withdrawal, one does tend to feel SOME withdrawal. I take anywhere from 7 - 10 grams a day at night just to wind down from my day and do some creative writing / take care of work stuff. I do get a bit antsy if I know I don't have it. Now I have to take other herbal supplements like valerian root just to get that level of winding down, lol. But it's not THE END of the frikin world! As far as I know I can always sleep, can always enter my creative space, function, etc...


What's really devastating is how little the US government seems to care about its people. It's truly, TRULY sad. ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)

I just got an email from my vendor. Apparently, there is a peaceful protest/march at the White House on the 13th. The American Kratom Association has also hired a top notch legal team to block the emergency scheduling. I guess they will be duking it out. I do not think these efforts will work, but I admire the work being put forth to try and be heard.

Can somebody please elaborate more on what's going on with the DEA and their unlawful plan to scedule Kratom? How can they do this, and why is this a thing? 


This frustrates me and strongly angers me. I have been using Kratom for years now and I ace relied on it to help me with many things that doctors have not had any luck helping me with.

Please feel free to say something in the thread I made in the Support forum(linked above). I will bump it soon, but really would be great if we had more people speaking up there.


The petition is already over 100K btw! We need to keep it going though, would be awesome to really blow it the fuck up!

I highly doubt there is that much scheming going on between the DEA and big pharma. One very real reason, though, is that the DEA get more funding the worse the drug problem is in the US. The more drugs are illegal, the mote enforcing that is necessary from the DEA and the more tax-payer dollars they need

Where did he talk about it and what did he say?


Was it on his podcast?


I'm a big fan of Rogan.


I've given up on this shit though.


I've always hated the war on drugs and the DEA and I think the best way I personally can get over it is to just try to forget that Kratom ever existed.


But fortunately for me I never needed it for chronic pain.


I feel REALLY bad for the people who did as they are the ones who will suffer from this.

This is a stupid question but I am curious to hear what y'all think. After my high wears off from a dose of Kratom, I become absolutely starving. I mean OUT OF CONTROL hungry. Does anyone know if Kratom depletes the body of any nutrients or chemicals?

^I assume u fast before using kratom.  I certainly did or wouldn't feel anything.  Then I'd get a nice buzz but after 2 hrs it'd be gone and I'd end up drinking alcohol to keep the buzz going.


Regarding this recent ban in the US, it was only a matter of time. I mean u have those comparing it to coffee, all while saying people will relapse to heroin if its banned?!  Little contradicting don't u think?   Coffee is hardly recreational, hence the lack of abuse.  Look at the reddit forum where people were buying it by the kilo, when i used i never bought more than 100 grams at a time, yet even then I still got a little obsessed with it for a time.  Opiates tend to do that. 

And lets put to rest this idea that the pharmaceutical companies are afraid of kratom.  I'd wager less than 5% of people even heard of it. It took me multiple attempts to feel the effects, and was never that great since the threshold of "feeling good" and "too much" were so close that I'd often end up feeling dizzy and nauseous in my attempt to have fun.  And if u tried taking it on a full stomach u were just wasting it, very unreliable in that sense.  

The first kratom I tried it was actually a liquid shot from Club 13, I had tried their salvia before with luck so trusted their quality.  I MIGHT have felt something from their products, looking back it must have been very weak compared to Vivazen and powered kratom.  

I usually had powdered, tried potentiating it with grapefruit juice but it never really satisfied me (once I felt the effects I always wanted to prolong them with alcohol, since redosing kratom is pointless).  It also made me crave cigarettes even tho i had quit yrs ago.  So all I can say is to stock up and enjoy this mediocre plant if u haven't yet quit, but when it's finally gone, i think you'll all breathe a sigh of relief.

8℅ of human population don't have the cyp2d6 liver enzyme function properly and will never be able to use kratom. Maybe youre one of those people? Also do you take any drugs that inhibit the cyp2d6 liver enzyme? When I took ssri paxil I could not feel kratom NO MATTER HOW MUCH I took. Grapefruit  juice is entirely useless if your cyp2d6 is wack. Not everyone is lucky to harness the power of kratom I'm sorry dude but that's the cold hard truth

Kratom does not need metabolism by CYP enzymes to be active. That's codeine you are thinking of: even then, codeine's glucuronide metabolites are somewhat active - it is not 100% inert in slow CYP metabolizers. Mitragynine and 7-OH mitragynine are active all on their own and aren't prodrugs.


Paxil will interfere with the adrenergic parts of the experience though - kratom works as a mild norepinephrine agonist which is part of why it's stimulating at lower doses and provides its unique headspace. It does so by direct activity at adrenergic receptors, which are downregulated with SSRI use.

I definitely did feel kratom, it took 7 grams on an empty stomach.  It just took some time to appreciate its effects.  But its effects are subtle, I almost nodded on it a few times but then woke up clear-headed.  It's really more of a stimulant, people in Thailand chew it while working.  I used to become really impatient on it, I wanted to talk but not listen for instance.    

I guess explaining why its not that popular (people are excited Joe Rogan mentioned it, the most famous person so far) is hard. If it was this great high it would've been banned like everything else 100 yrs ago.  The Internet brought it to enough people's attention that made it feasible to ban from the DEAs perspective.  Every spring there was a new batch of states banning it (i think 7 so far).  I guess u could try kava if u still need some legal high. Like kratom u need an empty and strong stomach, but its effects are more like alcohol since it affects ur GABA receptors. Its also more expensive and time consuming to prepare, and taste awful, but there's no talk of it being banned.

Sorry but this is a dumb post.


First off, you keep saying people NEED to fast to get good effects from Kratom but that's bullshit.


I never fasted when taking it and always got VERY high.


YOU think it's mediocre, fine, but I LOVED it and so did many people.


I barely ever got dizzy or naseaus and felt it on the first attempt so that happening to you is just your experience.


Also redosing Kratom was NOT pointless for ME and always worked without fail.


SOME people say they feel that way about it, but not me and it always worked when I redosed.


Too bad it made you crave cigarettes, I never smoked so I wouldn't know but i bet it doesn't make everyone who smokes crave them.


As far as "we were asking for it to be banned because we talked about it a lot online" this is the internet age and EVERYTHING gets talked about a lot online no matter what it is, drug or otherwise.


The DEA is stupid and there's no way really IMO to deny they are doing something unfair and unjust to ban a substance with no real serious dangers associated with it.


Kratom has helped probably THOUSANDS of heroin and hard opiate addicts get off their more harmful opiates and also helped people with anxiety and depression like me and people with serious pain problems like war veterans.


This just reads like a weak rant about why you personally didn't like Kratom.


Well so what??


Lots of people did and the ban is VERY unfair.

The DEA is dumb as hell. I bet when they heard about Kratom, they saw how it hits the opiate receptors and said "It's a narcotic! It's a NARCOTIC!" then comes the ban. Little do they realize the ban is going to result in more ODs. Fucking morons lol....

OR they might be even MORE sinister and realize that it will lead to more ODs and in fact want that.


I am buying more and more into some of the conspiracy theories even though I usually don't.


The DEA, Big Pharma and the Prison System probably all have things to gain not only through illegalization of Kratom but all sorts of drugs.


The system needs to keep running and people getting arrested from drug use makes money for prisons and the DEA and allows Big Pharma to keep their monopoly so there's nowhere else to turn for pain relief other than their really expensive opiates like Hydro/Oxy/Dilaudid.


I think at the highest levels there isn't even the INTENTION to help ANY addicts.


I think they all know the deal and that the war on drugs is all about money for the DEA, police in general, prison system, big pharma, etc.


I don't think they give a shit about over doses.


If they did they'd make it a health issue and send junkies to hospitals not prisons but they don't.

You're right. If the DEA actually gave a shit about health concerns how come cigarettes are not banned? of course, because it's a matter of $$$. Billion dollar tobacco industry puts money in their pockets as does Big Pharma. So as long they share a portion of their profits, the DEA will look the other way.

Anybody has experience with crushed leaf? I'd like to know what's the best way to take it.

I normally use powder but this time I have a bunch of crushed leaves, looks like this: 


<details>
<summary>IMG</summary>


![Thai_Kratom_2.jpg](https://www.bluelight.org/community/proxy.php?image=http%3A%2F%2Fpsychoactiveherbs.com%2Fcatalog%2Fimages%2FThai_Kratom_2.jpg&hash=ec110cee6b0b9104ceedc1f5df0810d9)]


</details>


With powder I put my dose in a plastic bottle, add some water, mix it a finally chug it. 

I tried grinding the leaves in a blender (don't have a coffee grinder) and the result is a fine powder with little sticks mixed together. I noticed it takes longer to come up and it's not quite a strong as the powder, but it usually lasts a bit longer. 

I heard kratom tea is the way to go with crushed leaf but it takes longer to prepare, ect... I really prefer to T&W.

Crushed leaves are perfect to just chew on (if you are man/woman enough to handle the taste ![:p](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)). The effects are more stimulating that way ime.

If I had whole leaves I'd probably try it, but this is just too powdery (but not enough to T&W effectively ![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif) ). Plus I don't think it would be as strong, that means I'd have to take more to have the same effects as T&W. I usually prepare my kratom within 1-2min, drink it and feel its effects 15-40min later even if a have some food in my stomach 


I'm starting to think I made a big mistake, should've bought kratom powder. This just seems like an inferior product (hope i'm wrong), I'm going to try the tea today. 

I have 250g of this stuff! 8(

Usually you chew and swallow the mush afterwards. I also made the experience, that crushed leaves were some waste product.


Rule of thumb : The bitterer the better. If it is not bitter at all, it is most likely junk or some maple.


Generally crushed leaf is superior (if it is not junk).

I made a cup of kratom tea and it is very very bitter so hopefully the quality won't be an issue. I also added a bit of ascorbic acid to help the extraction. 

I'm going to drink it in a couple of hours, just put it in the fridge for now.

Tea is the safer way to consume anyways. I hope your brew will have the desired effects. The bitterness is a good indicator %)

I take the capsules at 500mg each and the instructions state take 5. I've taken as many as 7-8 and sometimes I get a 20 burst of energy sometimes nothing. I don't take everyday have taken for about 2 months. I need the energy and euphoric effect, I have yet to feel euphoric. I have red Bali, red Thai, green Malay, meagnda Thai, and white vein Thai all capsules. I've heard so many people say they get that oxy feeling but I'm not looking to be sleepy. For my oxycodone makes me awake alert motivated and chatty and I could literally clean the entire house.

They probably prescribe nothing. That means I would not count on it. If they prescribe something it will most probably inferior (more addictive, more side effects, or no desired effects at all).


You should try to taper NOW and not rely on the advice of some drug dealer.


If you would be my kid, I would help you tapering down, then withdraw, then I would send you to a martial arts dojo for a few months (few times a week) and as soon as you have become stable enough the ass whopping will be inevitable. ![:sus:](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/suspicious.gif)


No offense if you are not a kid, you come along like a 12-years old.

What's your normal dose? 9 months of taking kratom everyday will make you physically dependent but if ain't dosing too high the WDs could be relatively mild. You should follow Ziirp's advice to be honest.


So I made several batches of kratom tea and it does work but not quite as I expected, doesnt last very long at all either. I'm going to try to grind my leaves as much as possible and toss and wash them as I usually do with powder. I'll try to improve my brewing method as well, maybe I'll be able to get better results.

So I'm a Kratom website owner. I had dedicated myself to this plant and providing quality and tried everything that I imported in to the country to asses quality and make sure it was safe (as in once I had suspected shipment contaminated with datura). As buisness grew I had trouble keeping up and find myself eating 36+ grams a day. Besides really enjoying it I have never been so productive and no longer found a need to drink. I feel I've always suffered from anxiety which was also medicated. Now with this impending DEA ban BS I am lost. This plant economically sustains me as much as the Indonesians I buy from who are just as worried. For most of the Indo people I've talked to with smaller setups we are their only buyers although some have found buyers in other countries and have suggested I move there to set up something which I'm sure is much harder than it sounds. Besides being faced with financial ruin, a baby due in a week, I feel the pressure to quit as I'm sure I'm on some list as one of the potential places to get raided. Looking around here I appear to be taking a lot of Kratom. Can anyone speak on tapering from larger doses or have experience leaving larger doses behind? FML

Come to Europe. The mockernment is more liberal here in that regard (the pharmaceutical industry and the (pseudo?)-scientific arch, that is called psychology have not married here, YET).


In your case I would probably move to Indonesia. ![:?](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/confused.gif)


The difficulty with tapering is to find an activity, that creates enough endorphines to fill the void. The cheapest path would be to reduce the dosage and simultaneously increase the route you are running every day. This is really the easiest way IMHO.

I can't speak from personal experience on tapering because I only discovered Kratom about 7 weeks ago. I have read others state that tapering Kratom is fairly easy. I know one person was taking a large daily dose (similar to yours) and initially started the taper by cutting the dose in half. Then tapered a gram or so less every couple days after that. I'm sure others can give you personal tapering advice that may be more helpful. 


I do understand your anger about the DEA ban. Kratom is what got me off oxy with zero withdrawals which is amazing. I am worried about going back to harder opiates once I no longer have access to Kratom. I will try my best to stay sober because my addiction almost destroyed my life. I think many people are in a similar predicament. It totally sucks and I'm sorry you're losing your business over a stupid government decision.

I have been taking about 10 grams of  red veined Mang Dai or however its spelled...several months of experimenting lead me there..It has worked for both pain and anxiety.  I have barely needed to touch my benzo script (klonopin). As for pain, i know someone who has borrowed low doses of oxy now and again from a generous family member.  Said person hasn't needed to do much borrowing since using kratom.

Supposedly on some other sites some vendors are saying they aren't going to stop selling after the ban but will be MUCH more careful about it and use Bitcoins or TOR which I don't understand and which are harder to track.


There's also the Dark Net which I don't understand and me personally I'd never feel safe ordering an illegal substance online BUT there are LOTS of people who do it and a whole lot of them get away with it.


It won't be openly sold like in the past, but I think if we all assume no one will try to oppose the ban we are wrong.


There will be a lot of risks and penalties, more for those who sell than those who buy, but I think it's not going to entirely drop off the face of the earth.


What I personally hope, but doubt very much, is that it will SOMEHOW become available on the street.


I don't know how it would though, both with it mostly being unknown to your average drug user, or by what means people would obtain it, but then again, how to drug dealers obtain their large stashes of any illegal drug???


The question is whether or not THE DEMAND will be there.


BUT...if it IS, there will be drug dealers to sell it.


The war on drugs has never worked for any drug.


So again, it's really all an issue of popularity and whether or not any of your usual street drug dealers will see it as profitable or any big wig illegal drug traffickers will decide to import large shipments from countries like Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand.


I personally really hope they do, but I won't be buying any online after the ban.


No way would I put myself at that risk for no good reason.


But where there's a will there's a way, and laws have rarely worked to banish any illegal activity, substance, or even objects like illegal guns.


It may not COMPLETELY dissapear like we all think, but all the open legal online vendors and head shops that sell it will be gone for sure.

What really stinks is, I have never done an illegal substance. But for the first time in my life, I find myself wondering if I should.  I wonder if it's going to be illegal the same way marijuana is, yet it left up to each state to enforce?

The ironic thing is I'm probably going to simply ask a doctor for a replacement and I will end up with (as someone said above) something far more dangerous with a larger potential for addiction.  From what I have seen and read, Kratom would fit in with the schedule V drugs.

No, Kratom is going to be considered Schedule ONE which is fucking retarded, just like weed, which is retarded as well.


It MIGHT be moved up, but I doubt it.


Also, it will not be up to each state, it is going to be illegal nation wide.


I'm so fucking angry about it but I'm trying to almost be past it now.


I don't even think I am probably going to stock up cause it'll run out eventually anyhow and I don't need to get more obsessed with it than I already am.


I'm just trying to forget about it.


There are still other good drugs out there to do, both illegal and legal, though they are very different from Kratom.


It really sucks and I hate the DEA and hope I live to see the day they are dissolved completely and the war on drugs ends, but nevertheless, it's still just a drug.

Little contradicting don't u think?   Coffee is hardly recreational, hence the lack of abuse.

Opiates tend to do that.

It took me multiple attempts to feel the effects, and was never that great since the threshold of "feeling good" and "too much" were so close that I'd often end up feeling dizzy and nauseous in my attempt to have fun.

I live in Canada so it is still legal here but I don't think this plant is that great. I have been doing it for 2 yrs, and although I started twice a week I now do it every night.. and when I don't I get cravings / withdrawal and trouble sleeping.

Do you get physical withdrawal symptoms along with the trouble sleeping? And after using for 2 years, are you still able to achieve any effects from Kratom?

**Just found out why Kratom is illegal**


So I was wanting to get off my prescription pain pills and discovered Kratom. I was enjoying this natural leaf for a couple weeks and then I got the news it was banned at the end of the month. I hurried and ordered different types just so I could see what each one does before I can't get it anymore. I ordered Kratom 10x extract. I popped a half teaspoon in sour cream and then started to clean up the kitchen. Problem is, I put the Sour Cream in the cabinet and the extract in the refrigerator. I got all goobered up in my brain. The natural leaf worked perfectly as a pain pill/ mild relaxer but those extracts are straight up dangerous! I Gorked up my brain for like 12 hours. I'm throwing that shit out.  I'm sad I'm losing my natural leaf kratom but that extract cooked my brain for the whole day. Horrible feeling. I give the natural dried leaf an A+ but the extract is crap.

I do it all day every day I never had problems.just listen to your body. It will tell you when it wants kratom. And if it ain't satisfied, that means u aren't ingesting enough. i It's when u ignore it that you suffer. I haven't suffered for a single minute for months since I started kratom...

Well I went to my doctor (I have an arnp/crna that I visit regularly to manage  low back/hip pain.  She's really open and basically handed me a script for tramadol, saying it's mild and low risk for addiction.  I will post updates later,  as my dad has said it makes him feel similar to kratom.

Tramadol can be really addictive as its an opioid and a SSRI and withdrawal can be really really nasty

Imo something like codeine would be better

The best remedy for lower backpain (you did not mention the origin) is running. If the pain is mostly present while sitting you should try it.

Haha nice! Well I like that. 

To be honest though I'm now taking a night off. It is going OK because I am supplement with valerian root tea all day. I feel that taking this tea helps with withdrawals. I understand the logic behind taking kratom all the time, but for me financially that is just not viable. I also want to know that I can get off it if I need to.

Ow how wrong tramadol is an opioid and has an unique and unnecessary anti-depressant like effect profile which can cause severe acute depression amongs other nasties (such as brain zaps) , my point is that it might not be the strongest opiate but to intolerant users it's very abuseable and will convert even non-opiate aficionados. Look up brain zaps as a WD symptom which is unique for an opioid. I think it's very dangerous to hand out tramadol easier than say morphine , I don't think it's any less recreational just way more dangerous it also can easily cause on to have seizures at dosages upwards of 300 mg.


Perhaps relay some of this information to your doctor , like so many of her peers she's seems tragically misinformed. Actually tramadol has a low chance of killing you by respiratory depression unlike other opiates and that's what made doctors judge it as safer and less recreational/addictive than morphine I'm still not sure if they are to right all I know for sure is it's way nastier and more insidous than morphine.

She is not disinformed. She just does not care about the lifes of a junkie from the plebs. The longer they are addicted, the longer they mean a secured income source. Plus they stay controllable. I would probably do the same (prescribing Tramadol for chronic lower back pain) if I had no heart and no human qualites.

I don't see tramadol as way more dangerous than morphine from an overdose perspective.  Sure, tramadol sucks and everything, but morphine is a pretty hardcore drug by most accounts.

I still have to be realistic and think Kratom will be illegal after Sept 30th but I'm copying and pasting this from the Drugs in the Media forum:


"Many have become resigned, feeling helpless and hopeless when it comes to keeping kratom legal. But there is reason for hope! In fact, a recent letter issued by the Center for Regulatory Effectiveness (CRE) offers several rays of hope. There are also a few additional developments that offer further reason to believe in the possibility that kratom could remain legal beyond September 30, 2016. In fact, the CRE is calling upon the DEA to take several actions, including delaying the Schedule I classification of kratom until July 1, 2017.


The CRE has sent a letter to acting DEA administrator Charles P. Rosenberg, informing him that “when 100,000 members of the public express outrage with a regulatory decision, it deserves a second look. Consequently, CRE, in its role as a nationally-recognized regulatory watchdog, is going to investigate this matter.


The CRE has reportedly received hundreds of letters, written by kratom advocates just like you who took the time to share your experiences with kratom. And your voice has been heard!


The CRE is now calling for The Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) parent agency, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), to take action. This agency has the ability to intervene with regulatory agencies such as the DEA. The CRE cited “a sharp disagreement among a number of federal agencies” as grounds for the proposed intervention. The CRE wrote, “If there were ever a time for an OMB intervention, this is it.”


The Center for Regulatory Effectiveness cites several compelling arguments in favor of kratom.


So do your bit and let them know how you feel!!! If you sit on your hands then there is no chance at all."

Can anyone else confirm?


And while I am going to watch a little bit of that video, and thanks for providing it, I was wondering if anyone can tell me a little more about what, if any, actual impact it had on the situation??

I understood from the video that it needed 200,000 sigs (could be wrong) to go before congress. He said it was the best chance of at least postponing the ban till July 2017.

       You have to listen yourself as I wasn't exactly sure where in the video he said that. I thought he said kratom has a good chance if it goes before congress also. 0 fatalities for kratom alone. Kratom is a plant after all too. (which also could be considered a herbal medicine)


       I think sig count is over 100,000 now.....but don't want to say for sure.

Well I just posted in Drugs in the Media that the petition had 120,000 votes and was sent to the White House today.


However, I would NOT be satisfied with it just becoming illegal in July, I don't want it to become illegal EVER in the United States.


BUT...if we can get it pushed back to July we have a better chance of permanently stopping it from becoming illegal.


I think it's the same idea the DEA had in making it just a "1-3 year ban" in that they are probably thinking that will make it easy for them to say in three years "oh yeah, by the way, it's staying illegal" and that would be that.


If we can get it delayed for the majority of a year maybe we can pick up more steam to keep it permanently legal.


An extra 10 months isn't enough for me.

Of course I want it to stay legal but I'll gladly take 10 months. My back pain has returned on a more consistent basis   and I want to go back to using it when I need AND  want it without fear of using up my stash.

I'd be shocked if the ban got overturned or pushed back. This is an emergency temporary ban for them to get their shit together and ban it for good.


Look at marijuana, widely more popular, probably safer than kratom, and even legal in several states. But it's still illegal at the federal level and mainstream politicians avoid the topic. Hell, it's still Schedule 1.

My point is, don't hold your breath.

I read an article that was too big for me to post stating that Big Pharma has already isolated the alkaloids/compounds in Kratom and is planning on eventually marketing it themselves and that is why they got the DEA to do their dirty work for them.


IF it's true it's what we all suspected BUT...AT LEAST then we'd have a possibility of somehow getting a more expensive synthesized version of Kratom, either by doctor's prescription if we could pull it off, or if not, well, we all know what happens to prescription medications that get you high, they end up on the street sooner or later...


If Kratom truly becomes banned as proposed, I bet it will eventually be lowered to a schedule saying that it has medicinal value cause if not, then how could Big Pharma market it??


Wouldn't they rather make money off?

This is a video from a Marine Corps Veteran who's own doctor ran tests on him before and after taking Kratom and approved his usage of Kratom stating that it was in fact SAFE.


I've never heard a doctor's legit opinion on Kratom before, with paper work provided that is visible in the video.


Even more reason why this plant should NOT be banned.


Share these kinds of links on as many sites as we can.


We want to FLOOD the internet with this stuff.

They could market their chemical version of it without releasing the plant from schedule 1 just the same way they tried to market synthetic thc without releasing cannabis from schedule 1.

Does anybody know if Kratom has a warming effect similar to opiates?


By that I mean you do some heroin and you feel much warmer than normal, especially in colder temperatures...


I have very limited experience with Kratom and I haven't done it in the winter yet.

My doctor would never prescribe me a narcotic or schedule 1 substance. The whole point of kratom (for me at least) was that it's easily accessible. If I have to get a script, I might as well take oxycodone. The whole thing is just so stupid that I'm not even angry, I'm laughing. What a bunch of dipshits. Nobody wins from the ban.  Not even big pharma...unless the purpose of the ban was to drive people back to Pharmaceutical opiates.

Interesting. During spring/summer/fall I hated how opiates warmed me up. During the winter I liked it.


I haven't noticed it from kratom yet, but it's a subtle drug to begin with. I basically describe it as being like a strong energy drink without the jitters.

The standard line is that you don't know exactly what's in it, it's not controlled/ will vary from batch to batch, not FDA approved, blah, blah, blah....The implication is that we're all too stupid to figure anything out for ourselves and, in effect, the miniscule possibility of some kind of adverse reaction is somehow enough to justify not utilizing kratom despite the enormous benefits. 


The "justification" for this ban is an insult to our collective intelligence. The DEA should have no authority in making decisions that are in any way science related. The DEA is like a cult. DEA agents really believe (or used to believe, at least) that they are doing some kind of genuine public service by intercepting pot shipments. They need a reason to justify their existence. They shouldn't have any say in scheduling substances. They are not a scientific body in any way, shape or form and it's almost a conflict of interest for them to be able to schedule things (so they can continue to justify their budget, jobs, and general existence). They have become a self serving entity. 


They should take the majority of DEA agents and reassign them to human trafficking - something that would actually make a difference in the world.

As far as medicinal value, kratom is way, way, way more straightforward than weed. For example, there is absolutely no doubt that it helps with pain. You don't even need a study to figure that that out. 


"No medicinal value" and "high potential for abuse" is just.....fucking stupid.

I hear what you're saying but I actually think the medical benefits of pot are pretty straightforward. The ONLY reason people don't recognize them is because pot got associated with hippies, stoners and getting high. In other words, it got very much caught up in the silly cultural debate about whether it is morally acceptable to alter your conscious with a substance other than alcohol, tobacco or caffeine. But any person who knows anything about medicinal plants will recognize that pot has medical uses instantly.


And the way our culture has become, it doesn't matter how obvious something is people won't believe it until you show them a study.

Yeah but nobody can deny that is has a "High potential for physical dependency."


The thing is, regardless of it being a safer alternative to h, it still is a mind altering substance and causes physical and psychological dependency. It does not surprise me in the least bit that kratom is going to be scheduled, and it shouldn't surprise anyone else.

My point was just that kratom is a clear, safe substitute to other, far more dangerous and addictive pharmaceutical opiate/ opioid pain medications. It's method of action is known (the fact that it hits delta opioid receptors is part of what makes it safer) and it obviously works for pain, so how can a non-scientific body like the DEA flippantly claim that it has no medicinal value? It's absurd.

Well schedule 1 drugs don't mean there is zero medical use for them, it just means they don't have an ACCEPTED medical use.. There is a difference, especially when most people of authority are close minded or corrupt.


  I personally think kratom should be schedule 3 or 4, basically meaning that you should be able to get a prescription written for you by a doctor and that it is less addictive than drugs that are schedule 1 or 2. But pharmaceutical profits were definetely taken into consideration, when it got scheduled!

I think it should be regulated to some degree(purity, source, etc), but certainly not scheduled. It should be over the counter in the nutrition aisle at like GNC or the pharmacy.

Think of all of the OTC stuff that has the potential to be much more harmful both physically and psychologically(addiction)...


You can't overdose on it and it doesn't really impair you, at least not like alcohol, weed, or real opiates.

There have been batches, that were indeed able to put you down to bed for a few hours feeling sick if you dosed too much. But it is correct, that the likelihood of dying from a Kratom OD is significantly (ld50 was never tested? even if was tested for the mitragynine derivates, then it would be difficult to estimate the ld50 of the substance orchestration, that Kratom is) lower than for opiates and alcohol.


Weed is still a little saver physically while mentally it is more dangerous when abused ime.

In my opinion, the strains are more similar than they are different and alkaloid content/ variety can vary batch to batch. If you're stuck, just pick one and work from there. Bali is more relaxing/ sedating and Maeng Da is the most energizing. Then there's everything in between. There's a lot of info on the interwebs. I believe the main differences are between the "white vein", "green vein" and "red vein" varieties. 


I tend to go with Maeng Da but I'll take any of them, really.

It's a tree from southeast Asia. It's related to the coffee plant. It's not opium. You can order it online from a ton of different places and even some headshops/ smoke/ vape shops carry it. However, it's going to be illegal at the end of September, so you might as well forget about it at this point.

It is the leaves of the tree Mitragyna Speciosa, it contains many alkaloids, most notable Mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine. These substances do activate opioid receptors, however they would be consodered opiOIDs, not opiates, as the don't occur in the poppy plant and aren't derived from poppy plant alkaloids. Has always been legal in the U.S. but not for long, as the DEA has decided to emergency schedule it as a class 1 drug. A shame really, as it's a pretty mild source of natural opioids, with a ceiling effect and no respiratory depression, making for a great alternative to street/pharmaceutical opioids. It is addictive, but less so than strong opioids, and can serve as a maintenance. The main thing to worry about is vendors adulterating it woth other chemicals. It's been offered online for sale as far back as 2005, but recently it became more popular, being offered at head shops and even gas stations, hence the DEA getting involved.

Not trying to be nit picky here, but kratom doesn't contain any opioids. That's a common misconception. Kratom's alkaloids do bind with some of the same receptors as opiates but it's only a small subset of receptors. The kratom alkaloids could be better thought of as being like endorphins that loosely stimulate some of the opiate receptors. The method of action is distinct from opioids and it's the reason that kratom is safer (i.e. no substantial respiratory depression, if any) and much less addictive than opiates/ opioids.

This is completely wrong. Kratom is a mu and kappa opioid receptor agonist. This has been experimentally demonstrated many times. Its true that it doesn't elicit substantial respiratory depression though.

OK, you're right but I might not be *completely* wrong. There may be some room for interpretation. Is salvia generally considered an opioid because it acts on kappa opioid receptors? Thinking about it, in all honesty, I think I'm just trying to distance kratom from the term opioid because it has a negative connotation with the general public.

Salvia is a kappa opioid agonist. Kratom primarily acts on mu opioid receptors just like classical opioids. I think trying to distance from a term opioid when it's mechanism of action is *almos*the same will ive people the wrong impression--especially when you say it outright isn't an opioid.


I would highlight the research that has shown in animal models that kratom simply isn't addictive. It's hard to get mice addicted to it in self administering tests, and it can take around 6 times longer to develop tolerance than opiates. There are mechanisms we don't understand, and further reseach could provide great insight into nociceptiona and maybe novel mechanisms for developing/preventing tolerance to mu opioid agonists.

I just called my congressman/respresentative's office today and spoke with one of my representative's staff members about Kratom and shared the entire story and he was extremely polite and said he would mail me back a response.


Call (202) 224-3121 and ask for your representative's number and they'll ask you for your zip code and then tell them to sign the Pocan/Salmon Dear Colleague Letter (make sure to spell out the name of the letter so they don't get it wrong) and how 130,000 people have already signed a petition to the White House to stop Kratom's ban and if you want you can share your story and tell why it is so wrong that they are trying to ban Kratom.


He said I wasn't the first person in my area to call about this issue.


THIS IS THE FIRST THING LIKE THIS I'VE EVER DONE IN MY LIFE!!


It felt good to do, regardless of whether or not I make an impact.


PLEASE EVERYONE WHO READS THIS PHONE YOUR REPRESENTATIVE ASAP!!!


People are saying it must be done by 4:30PM so you have HALF AN HOUR Eastern Standard Time or I guess 2-3 hours if you are on the West Coast depending on your area.


DON"T DELAY!!!


(But even if you DO miss that deadline I'd suggest you KEEP calling!!!)


WE MIGHT be able to make a difference!!

For those of you who used Kratom to kick opiates (like myself), are you worried about going back once Kratom is banned? I haven't had to deal with cravings in a while and I'm wondering if it's going to come back full force now. I really hope not....

Think about it dude, how likely is it that all of a sudden an opiate addict is going to never take another single opiate for the rest of their lives. Not likely whatsoever. This is slow kill.

Oxygal, I am VERY worried! My partner just jumped on mmt Tuesday because of the ban. He didn't want to go through what little kratom I have stocked up for myself. I'm really not wanting to go back to the up and downs of addiction and for the first time in my ten year addiction I am seriously thinking about getting on mmt. 

I've been reading your posts on the kratom threads. How are you holding up?

I'm a little freaked because I know how my story goes. I've felt so solid bc of Kratom over the past few months when in  reality, to some degree, dosing Kratom isn't exactly being sober. I have a stock but I know it's obviously not going to last and it's turned into such a crutch for me. It makes me alert and I function like a "normal" person but I guess the reality is that I have to learn to be sober without ANYTHING. 


It's just been nice to have my vice be a legal one. I guess time will tell if I can really hack it without anything in the near future. I'm just preparing myself for cravings and trying to convince myself I won't go back to the shit life I was living when I was popping roxi everyday. 


I've been truly happy and that's what sucks. I'm going to ride it out before I decide to go to any type of maintenance plan. Hoping for the best!


Thanks for asking and I wish the best for you, too!

I see I'm not the only one in a pickle because of the ban. The DEA doesn't realize how many people this ban is going to put back on heroin, pills, etc...so shortsighted of our government. 


I take about 5 grams 3 times a day and I'm going to run out in a few days...In the past I've been through REALLY bad oxy withdrawal with no comfort meds, I've tapered off a 3 year suboxone habit successfully, I started to get methadone withdrawals after about a month binge of 50 mgs a day (kicked those withdrawals in the butt with Kratom). But I've have yet to completely kick Kratom. From the days I've gone without though it seems to be quite a bit easier than oxy, I just haven't gone past a day or two though.


My question is I'm going on a short vacay next weekend with my wife (she doesn't know about any of this) and I REALLY don't want to be sick for it. Thinking of starting tomorrow with no Kratom and see how the week goes and if I feel better by the end of the week just sell the Kratom to someone in need OR if I don't feel that much better I'll have the Kratom for my vacay....fuck this ban! Good plan?

That's what I would do, go through the w/d now and save the kratom for your vacation so you can truly enjoy yourself.  Because  even if you are feeling better physically the depression and shit can stick around for a while.

Never personally taken the time to make kratom tea. Always seemed way easier to just toss it in some grapefruit juice and wash it down.

It was better than without but my tea use is very limited since  I have no problem stomaching the powder. However if I'm out of juice and just have water I'll add sugar to the k-mud to make it more tolerable.

That's cool to hear that sugar might actually improve the taste for some. I figured it wouldn't, because it never seemed to help with poppy tea (for me anyways). If anything, I remember when adding sugar to poppy tea, it just made it even more gross and it made it more likely that I would vomit, lol . I figured kratom tea would be similar, but perhaps not. Cool.

The worst tasting juice I've used with PST was WGFJ, partly because of having to drink so much of it. At least with kratom  I can down it like a really big shot glass and only taste it once. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Nice name, I remember the 2010-2012 RC rush, good times.  

Kratom is not doing that much for me, I have only used 2.5gs of heroin in the past several months with the last 2 gs coming the 1st-12th of this month and my legs are still killing me and because of this I really want to use again. fuck hhaaha

For some, yes. Kratom may not be able to get them high necessarily but it still may be able to keep them well or atleast lessen any withdrawals. Therefore kratom is not necessarily useless even to those currently taking strong opiates.

Agree, and it actually can still give you a buzz with an opiate tolerance IME, probably due to the other alkaloids though. I've noticed that I can't feel kratom extracts practically at all, I'm guessing the reason for that is that the opioid alkaloids are targeted for extraction, and they're dosed too low to catch a buzz from the other alkaloids. That's just a guess though. But I also get a lot more from the white vein (stimulating) strains, so it would make sense. It's definitely not an intense buzz, but it can be very euphoric for me still. And yeah, back when I was using opiates daily it was a godsend for withdrawal, didn't get me high but the relief alone made me feel high.

I've been dosing 12-24 grams a day and it's just not very strong. It does stop the suicidal withdrawal but leaves the other pains for me. Can't wait to get some heroin and coke on the 30th after I get paid for the month. End this disease.

Yeah, it can take a LOT to alleviate WDs unfortunately. My habit only lasted 6 months at most and it took me 10 grams to get rid of WDs if I can remember correctly. At least it helps a little though, got any other comfort drugs? When I was working and going through WDs, I used ondansetron, clonidine, low doses of dxm, and smoked a lot of weed. I also had mirtazapine and/or benzos at night, but I couldn't use them a lot because they make me feel so unmotivated and out of it the next day. WDs while working fucking suck, I feel for you.

^^^ Thanks, 

Yeah, I've been dependent on benzos for just over a year now so that's not gonna help much, I've doubled the doses the last few days tho and notice a little bit of relieve the first day then nothing after that. I have taken all my clonidine and ondansatron in the last several months which was a decent stockpile of ~100 clonidine and ~30 ondasetron. 

And, I have used DXM w/ chloropheniramine in the form of alka-seltser cold&cough quite a few times- and this even has ~750mg of asprin per 20mg DXM. 


About a week ago I scraped the safe that I keep my dope in and every thing else that touches the dope (straw, credit card), and I got like a ~10mg line and it made me feel so much fucking more comfortable. 

It's underestimated the length of time that the dysregulation of opiate system will make you feel wrecked, I believe.

I think when I did pharmaceutical ketamine for a few days in a row one of the last times I was without for a while, that it resets your tolerance to things- certainly knocks you out at the right dose.

MY BIGGEST regret w/ the Kratom Ban in 3 days is:


I was hoping it would become like weed, where the potency was breed-up, and you went from 1-3%THC to 15-30% THC, imagine instead of a 1-6% mytragynine contained in Kratom it would be 15-30% - THAT would be a plant. One pill cure.


That could be a real commercial product that has been missed, and is benign.

I used to fold a paper hot-dog style (lengthwise) and pour about 2-3 grams of kratom and about 8+ grams of sugar and stir it once or twice and down it like a BC-powder , ROUGH SHIT, better w/ sugar than w/o, however.

I can't seem to accomplish the T&W method but I'm sure it's less painful than drinking it slowly. What has worked the best for me is mixing with OJ. It ALMOST kills the horrid taste although I still gag from time to time.

So I received this email today from a kratom vendor I have used in the past:


Dear valued customer,


We have received news from the American Kratom Association lawyers that the DEA has announced that they have no intention of submitting a final judgement on October 1st. Howver they still will retain the right to do so with at least a 48 hours notice period. While this is a small win, it does allow vendors to operate within the  US and more importantly provide us with  enough time to comply with the law in the event the DEA decides to enact the final order. This is great news and shows that the hard work of the community is paying off.  More information to follow.


Sincerely,


(removed) 


I can't seem to find any other information at the moment to corroborate this, but I figured I would share this with you guys anyways.

So according to the tracking information I received my shipment should have arrived today...but it didn't come with the mail. It even says departed facility out for delivery.

Could something have happened you think? It was a kilo so I wasn't expecting it to fit in my mailbox but was expecting to at least see it on my doorstep.

I'm worried about this. I have already emailed my vendor and am awaiting her response.

8+ grams of sugar ??? Why the hell ? ![8o](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eek.gif) Better take in pure in the future to prevent diabetes. Just use orange/grapefruit juice to wash it down and you won't taste it at all. Sorry if you knew that already, but 8g is excessive as an additive for just 3g of Kratom.

Would not be a preferable development IMHO, Kratom would be much too strong then for a lot of people. Fatal overdoses would then be possible from plain leaf, which is a huge contra. Kratom is either a withdrawal aid for opiate addicts OR a mild-medium drug for opiate naive people. 


It has opioid-receptor antagonists also, that prevent it from increasing the tolerance of its users to it.


If you use it as a wd-tool, then don't expect to get high on it. The only strategy, that could help would be to mix 3-4 different strains, instead of taking only one type.

I feel your pain Cosmic. I placed an order Sunday night and got my UPS tracking # Mondays morning. After two days of my package not moving I called UPS  and they said  that they only had the shipping  label and the company never gave them my package. Now it's past the shipping deadline. ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png) Luckily I'm not out any money since it was COD but I guess that's what I get for panic ordering and using a vendor I haven't used before. ![:X](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/mad.gif)

That's the thing, it's a very reputable source. My tracking has been updated over the last two days, arrived in my city today, and departed the usps facility for delivery. I got all of my mail besides the kratom. Guess I'm calling the post office tomorrow? Is it dangerous to go in their to pick up a substance that's going to be schedule 1 the very next day?

I wouldn't think so  since its still legal besides I don't know about your vendor but my regular one (out of stock) never had kratom written anywhere on the package.

I'm sure the packaging was discreet. Guess I'll be looking into that tomorrow. Ugh. This is what I get for waiting until the last minute.

You kiddin man? That would be awesome. I don't think kratom causes as intense respiratory depression as other opiates, so I'm not convinced it can kill. Certainly ain't no morphine or heroin. If it was 30% like the thc in weed now is, that would be a usable drug.


And yeah, 8 grams of sugar crystals probably don't look much more than 3 grams of kratom powder because of the dense crystals. Lot better than straight Krat too

Kratom experts can i get some advise please ive been in pain management for more than 15 years after a car accident. Ive been as high as two 80mg oxys with four 30mg roxys a day believe or not ive weened myself down to three doses a day each dose is a 15 roxy and a half of another 15 roxy total 67.5 mg roxy a day. I have my kr- cough cough ready for jumpin do you guys think i can jump without missing work im planning on 7 grams bali for each starting dose. Im gonna try to get clonidine and lyrica from my doc maybe use the lyrica only when i jump to kr then the clonidine when i stop kr after atleast 3 weeks on kr. What can i expect goin from roxy to kr and then stopping kr after 3 weeks, remember ive been on oxy for 15 years never stopping does that matter or all that matters is the dose you jump off from thanks for any help getting ready to do this for real soon god i hope i can do it!!!!

Just wanted to throw this out there. I had much better success with a quick taper by reducing my dosing frequency rather than my dosage. I was at close to 15g a day but i actually went backwards when I was tapering down my dosage strength because i would almost always end up redosing when i didn't feel my dose at all. I very quickly went down to a couple grams a day by just going from 4-5x a day to 3x a day to 2x to 1x with lunch. Today or tomorrow will be zero kratom and honestly I really don't feel bad today so i might throw it out a day early.


I stocked up a few weeks ago thinking that there wouldnt be an issue with keeping stuff that i legally purchased, but now I really dont know. I'm thinking about writing to the DEA tonight and asking what they expect me to do lol. I most certainly won't have any scheduled substances  (aside from a couple valid prescriptions) in my possession besides possibly some kratom depending on how the new laws are going to be enforced.


Any thoughts? what is everyone else's plan for D-day?

another tidbit i want to add to my previous post (can't edit from mobile site) my doctor was surprisingly knowledgeable about kratom. He knew what it was and that it was soon to be banned. he actually supported my use. not sure if that would nullify the DEAs premise for making it schedule I, if my doctor doesnt have a problem with me using it pre and post ban.

What seemed like the worst kick in the mouth to sick people using this as medicine, is giving less than one month to figure out how you are going to treat your disease when it becomes illegal. Most pain doctors are so backed up that you cannot even get an appointment within one month.  So now when the 30th rolls around these people are just fucked going through withdrawal and in horrible pain and hitting the streets for heroin filled with care fentanyl not only does the DEA not care about this it probably makes them smile

While I don't believe that article is legit because I am skeptical, there ARE quotes in there, both from SUPPOSED DEA members and Susan Ash of the Kratom association, so if it IS fake, are the quotes just made up and who made them up??


I'd like to hear more about the background behind this article if anyone has it or any further developments if there are any, so lets keep it coming if we learn anything new, but I've already given up on this.

BIG UPDATE:


I know someone posted an article on this earlier, but multiple news sources are reporting that the DEA has "no timetable" for banning kratom. It appears that it will not be scheduled tomorrow,  but is still planning to be scheduled in the near future.


Now no one can really know how or when kratom will be scheduled until we get an official statement from the DEA, but it's promising that multiple news outlets are reporting a delay.


PLEASE CALL YOUR SENATORS NOW


A letter is circulating the senate today and tomorrow. It is being spearheaded by a very well respected member of the Senate (Senator Hatch) who is a big player in dietary supplement issues. Everyone has to call their senators ASAP if we want this plant to remain legal.


dial 202-224-3121 and press 1 to connect to your senators office.


It's now or never people! At the very least, call and leave a message!

3-5 grams.


 If you have a tolerance to opioids I'd start at 5 grams and work up (if needed) from there.


Yes, if your headshop carries it but it's much cheaper buying from an online vendor.

Plain leaf kratom doesn't have any significant respiratory depression and low doses are  generally fine together. However it's always best to try the kratom by itself first to see how you react to it. Also, I don't know about the Prozac.

I went to the only smoke shop near me that had anything left.


Got

Meta-Zen Kratom capsules green original blend.


Does this mean it's mixed with other shit? It says crushed leaf Kratom. Said it was a mix between stimulant and pain killing effects.

I haven't heard of that particular strain. You can't ever really be sure what head shops put in their products although I have purchased from one before in between Kratom shipments from my vendor. The kind I got was good and felt exactly the same. You should be fine if it says it's simply Kratom. I am curious about that strain tho so let us know how it goes! Is it already in capsules for you?

Oxygal, it is already in capsules. About .7g per capsule. 


They had red blend which obviously is more pain killing I guess? She said this was a mix of stimulant and Pain killing effects, while the White was very, very stimulating.


It says "kratom", and then mitragyna speciosa. Says "green original blend."

So since the ban isn't officially in effect and won't be for an unknown amount of time, what does this mean with vendors? Most say they are closed, but do you think any will re-open until the ban is official? At least with Bitcoin as the payment option?

How well does kratom store long term (6 months to a year, for example)?

From what I remember, this change might effect the kind of high (it'll become more or less stimulating, for example) but that kratom doesn't necessarily loose effectiveness when exposed to air long term. This is just loosely based speculation on my part based on something I might have read... Don't assume it's correct.

I heard it stores fine. Keep it dry tho so it doesn't mold.

Wait, what i'm hearing now is that kratom is NOT YET illegal.


From the articles linked in Drugs and Media the DEA has apparently been surprised by the backlash from Kratom supporters and they are saying they will delay the ban **momentarily** and open a public forum to discuss it, but the DEA is still stating "it's not a matter of IF but WHEN it becomes illegal" FUCKING ASSHOLES.


It seems we still have a SMALL shot.


I ain't holding my breath, and still have to be realistic that it doesn't look good for Kratom because the DEA is so downright evil it's like trying to stop Darth fucking Vader, but IF the reports are true it MIGHT not YET be illegal.


I want to hear more info about this to verify.

What would you guys recommend for starting dose?


I take Prozac and Valium daily.


I have original blend, looks like green crushed leaf Kratom.


Each capsule is about .7g.


I just want to experience a decent high.


I'm also on short course if prednisone for asthma.


Will I be ok trying out Kratom? What a good starting dose?

I guess they want to collect the personal data from the ban opponents first, in order to prosecute them more quickly after it became illegal.

for anyone holding out hope....just think of how much support there is for medical MJ, both population and scientific support.  DEA won't even change it from schedule I.


the support for kratom is nothing compared to MJ

While that is true, one difference is that weed DIDN'T have opposition BEFORE it was scheduled.  Back then there was probably ZERO opposition and no internet for people to easily make their opinions heard but now we can oppose this shit FROM THE SECOND the intention is placed to schedule a drug by the DEA, and while i'm NOT overly optimistic, if you read the article posted in Drugs and Media supposedly 10% of congress is against the ban and even Bernie Sanders has signed the petition!!!


It states that "the DEA was caught off guard by the backlash" and surprised by how many opponents there were.


If MJ had the opposition it has NOW from the very second the DEA TRIED to make it illegal I do NOT believe it would have EVER become scheduled, but we are fighting them on something that was scheduled back in the 30s or 20s if I'm not mistaken and that's a LOT of history to fight against.


Honestly, the Reddit Kratom forum has a LOT more information on this issue and Kratom in general than bluelight does and there's some interesting discussion going on there.


People are saying that maybe we are or can set a precedent for opposing the DEA.


I mean while we MIGHT not be successful with Kratom, what I read on Reddit about the issue started to make me question the following:


**Will there EVER be a day when the DEA tries to schedule something and the people SUCCESSFULLY oppose them??


I HAVE to think that ONE day it WILL happen, and why couldn't it possibly be this time???


**As powerful as they are the DEA does NOT have completely unchecked power.


Congress and the president have more power than them and they can't literally schedule ANYTHING they want WHENEVER they want.


The world IS changing and many people are becoming sick of government institutions telling us what we can and can't do (not just regarding drugs) and the world's political climate can change.


I don't think the war on drugs will end in our lifetime BUT I DO think it's quite likely that the DEA might try to do SOMETHING that is successfully opposed by the people and congress in our lifetime.


This MIGHT not be the time...**but I feel that all systems break down EVENTUALLY.**


Nothing lasts forever, and the DEA's days of scheduling any and all substances they want whenever they want may not be ETERNAL.


Sure, all the usual drugs other than weed will probably stay illegal throughout our lifetime...BUT, I think it is quite likely that they could be successfully opposed on certain issues within our lifetimes.


They are AT LEAST seeing that the people won't sit idly by with 140,000 signatures to the petition INCLUDING Bernie Sanders himself, and I would not be surprised if certain people in the DEA are actually a BIT surprised and taken aback by our efforts and perhaps not happy with it...and that at the very least is something I can take solace in.


I'm hoping in our lifetime we can do SOMETHING to oppose them, and shut down at least ONE law the DEA tries to pass, whether it's on Kratom or another substance.


They WILL weaken in time, their power CANNOT last forever.

These things all start with just ONE successful opposition after all, and once the precedent has been set there are ALWAYS more to follow.


The DEA is quite possibly scared about this.


NOT so much the Kratom issue in particular, but that this SEEMS to me to be more opposition than they have had in a while to their attempt to schedule anything.


Can anyone else confirm or deny with how much opposition the DEA got last time they tried to schedule a substance, ESPECIALLY an emergency scheduling to schedule ONE???


Was there this much opposition in the way of 140,000 signatures and 10% of congress supporting it last time they tried to do this kind of thing???


Cause I dont' think there was and IF there wasn't, then the DEA probably does NOT like this.


This COULD be the very SLOW beginnings and rumblings of a future "revolution" against the DEA.


These things ALWAYS start slowly, but once they hit they REALLY hit.


Kratom COULD be the start of it, or it might not...but at least it's opposition, and any opposition is good.

Exactly, the reason marijuana has and needs so much support is because how it was illegal for over half a century. That means the government has a HUGE investment in making it illegal. It takes a tremendous force of momentum to reverse all those years of prohibition, as there are powerful people who benefit from keeping things the way they are.  Legalizing brings about huge changes,  as we have seen with the states that have legalized medical or recreational  use. Even growers have been known to vote against legalization, as they don't want to lose their corner of the market. 


With kratom we don't have this problem. We are not reversing decades of prohibition, so we dont need as much support to effect changes. Truly it would be helpful if groups like NORML would lend us a hand here though.

Right.


So what do you think about the possibility that we might be able to stop the DEA from scheduling at least ONE substance, ANY substance (even if it's NOT Kratom) in our lifetimes, and that this COULD POSSIBLY set a precedent for weakening the DEA's seemingly absolute power??


You think maybe we might stop them on SOME issue in our lifetimes and that by the time we are old the DEA won't have as much power as they do now and that the war on drugs won't be QUITE *AS* "successful" as it is now??

So I've been experiencing my first Kratom high tonight. I took 4 capusles, which were about .7g each. So almost 3 grams in total. It was crushed leaf green, just called "original blend". I got it from a head shop, but it wasn't anything like an extract or something weird. It just says crushed leaf "Kratom", and then says the scientific name. Even though it doesn't have a particular strain on it, it definitely doesn't say "legal high" or any of that other bullshit you usually find at headshops. Just seems to be a blend of some green vein stuff. 


It's been almost 4 hours, and I've had a pretty damn good Opiate/Stimulant high. A nice balance between the two, but I felt the pain killing effects came on more pronounced later in the high. I'm still pretty damn high, which I guess is normal?


Since this is a green blend, makes me wonder what a red would do, as I know they are more on the painkilling side of things. 


It seemed to have made me very talkative and sociable, I guess the stimulant and opiate feeling combined. 


Very cool little thing, a shame they are going to ban it. I def. wouldn't take it everyday, but nice for every once in a while. Actually itching as much if not more than if I had taken 10-15mg Hydro.


It's a real shame that they are banning something like this that, from my perspective, I could see being a fantastic tool for weaning people of very hard drugs. 


I'm actually pretty blown away by the experience, I wasn't expecting this much of a high.

^ probably was not even worth real scheduling because mcPP (sp?) or whatever it is was basically poison that nobody had any desire whatsoever to use. people like kratom too much and it cuts into pharma profits too much, so it won't be ignored

I love hearing this.


I don't want to get TOO optimistic, but this kind of government support against the DEA is amazing to see.


I think the DEA are just bullies who want to control our minds and bodies in the supposed ATTEMPT to protect us from ourselves, but I bet at the highest levels they are all deeply corrupt and I'm sure some DEA agents even use the drugs they confiscate and laugh about it.


We know cases like that have happened before (reminds me of the movie "Training Day").


But they don't have absolute authority over congress and the senate.


It's all a matter of HOW much more support we can get from congress and the senate on this matter, but enough overall would be theoretically capable of stopping them.

It's mind boggling to me how they think they can just make a unilateral decision to ban kratom with 30 days notice, without public comment - absolutely stunning. In effect, they were trying to assume the role of a *scientific* entity, which they are clearly not. They are in the business of *enforcement*, not scientific decision making. Meanwhile, scientists are starting to research the alkaloids in kratom. Does the DEA think it's "smarter" than the scientists?


For anybody to just come out with the assertion that kratom has no medicinal value is asinine. There's just no common sense there, let alone scientific value. Let's just look at one aspect of kratom - analgesia/ pain killing. Nobody can tell me with a straight face that kratom doesn't help with pain. It's just so straightforward. In my opinion, it's more straightforward than weed. When I smoke or eat weed, it doesn't help with pain. That's just me. For other people, it does. But if you give kratom to 10 people with pain, I'm pretty sure all 10 of them are going to say that it works.


If this scheduling does go through, which it probably will, it will be one of the most damaging, illogical, authoritarian actions the DEA has ever taken. It will effectively stifle research and clearly, kratom has a very promising future. Again, just on the subject of pain management, there's nothing else in existence that hits opioid receptors in such a way that it virtually eliminates the risk of respiratory depression while effectively treating pain, in a nonaddictive way.


No medicinal value? Are they kidding? Kratom is just such a promising substance that it's criminal to try to ban it like they did.

Does Kratom effect serotonin at all? I've used a few times, and have seemed to be fine, but I just want to make sure.


I take 40mg of Prozac a day, and don't want to have to worry about serotonin syndrome.


Thanks!

It won't affect serotonin in such a way that you need to be concerned about serotonin syndrome. I've been on 60 mg and never had any issues.

Oh good! I've just got into Kratom, and really enjoy it. I've used for two days, then take two days off.


It's helping a little bit with my Valium taper. Down to 6.5mg from the one equivalent of 60mg (3mg Klon).


It also has helped me stay away from Rx opiates.

It's simple really why the DEA is in a hurry to ban Kratom. It puts more money in their pockets. Plus they KNOW it's helping people with addiction issues. It got me off Tramadol years ago. You think they want that kind of competition out there?


What they want is for you to stay hooked on drugs and keep going to rehab facilities, paying money. They do not care that Kratom helps. They would rather see you dead from addiction as long as they are getting paid.


It's ALL corrupt. As soon as you realize that. The better off you will be.

Really stupid question:


I have a scale. I've been using it to dose, and putting the Kratom into capsules.


This results in me taking a shitload of capsules, even with "00" size capsules.


My question is: if I wanted to use my scale to weight out via toss and wash, how would I get the Kratom back onto my teaspoon once I've weighed it?


I can't pick it up with my hands, it's like sand.


I know this is stupid, and maybe it's because I'm high, but how would I go about doing that?

The DEA  gets paid off this, they don't really want people to stop using drugs. They'd all be out of a job if that happened. Addiction is big business, alcohol and tobacco companies, the rehab industry, the court system, drug cartels, private prisons, police and big pharma all profit from the current system. They'd much rather keep us on suboxone or methadone than allow us to treat ourselves with a natural plant.

For those of you following the legal status, recent reports say the DEA is indefinitely delaying the ban. It sound slike theyre still planning on signing the order, but only after allowing for a public commebt perioid and consultation with the FDA.

I couldn't disagree more. 1 teaspoon if 1 powder can easily have > 50% than 1 teaspoon of another powder. I find weighing it to be extremely helpful for preventing tolerance since I'll be less likely to accidentally take twice as much kratom as normal thinking i just got some really potent stuff.

Hopefully they will not succeed.


9 senators including Bernie Sanders signed the petition to prevent the ban and I DO think it sounds like the DEA was pretty surprised and taken aback by all the backlash.


They MIGHT NOT actually end up banning it.


Only time will tell.

At least we have hope and honestly this is the only times ive seen some actions from our legislative branch that has directly, positively affected my life. It's nice to be heard. Except i never heard anything back from my senators


Something worth mentioning, though, is many of the senators and congresspeople who signed the letters have explicitly said theyre not pro kratom but are just wanting to make sure the DEA is not overstepping its authority.


There will be plenty of fighting ahead

DEA withdraws intent to schedule Kratom! Will have Public Comment Period lasting until December 1st.


Dear valued customer,


The DEA has announced that they are withdrawing their intent to schedule Kratom as per announcement dated August 31, 2016. They are now asking for a comment period to last through December 1, 2016. These comments which are made up of public comments, scientific research, FDA comments will be used to determine  how the agency will want to proceed.  While the fight is not over, this is a big win and even caught us by surprise (withdrawing original intent)!!   Stay tuned over the coming days for further analysis, discussion, and action items to help.


We are extremely proud of the Kratom community and want to say thank you. Keep up the fight.

It's baaaaaack!!!


I just got a similar email one one of my vendors will be shortly re-opening :D 


[h=1]DEA Withdraws Notice of Intent[/h]This morning, the DEA published the following notice, which withdraws its intent to temporarily schedule the two main alkaloids found in kratom, as well as opens a period for solicitation of comments - essentially, restarting the process properly:


[https://s3.amazonaws.com/public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2016-24659.pdf](http://mmmspeciosa.us7.list-manage.com/track/click?u=1c0d5628bc1ef8bb87185d0e8&id=2f6641e428&e=c6d39738b6)


Here is the full text of the response on Facebook this morning of AKA's Susan Ash:


"WE MOVED A MOUNTAIN AND NOW WE'RE PARTING THE SEA!!! Keep the pressure on; **wait for commenting instructions (from us) please**, we still have A LOT of work ahead of us.

FROM OUR ATTORNEYS! --

The DEA notice posted ([https://s3.amazonaws.com/public-inspection.f…/2016-24659.pdf](https://s3.amazonaws.com/public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2016-24659.pdf))

It withdraws the prior notice altogether and provides for a comment period [until December 1.](https://www.bluelight.org/vb/x-apple-data-detectors://2) It asks for an FDA analysis and says that after it reviews the comments and info from FDA, DEA will determine whether to use emergency scheduling for one or both substances, or permanent administrative scheduling through the regular scheduling process (or no scheduling).

"I’m still reviewing, but this looks like a big win."


AKA asks that, when the comment period opens, *everyone hold off on submitting their public comments*. We will relay their lawyers' guidelines at that time via newsletter and on the home page.


I don't even really use kratom anymore and already have a bunch but I'm still excited for everyone who benefits from it.

I am so happy. 


I placed an order shortly before the end of August and my package never got delivered. I think it was either stolen or the mailman misdelivered it... The tracking shows delivered but nothing ever arrived. I ordered from a reputable well known place so I don't suspect scam. My local post office wasn't helpful, they claim it was delivered.


I was so annoyed and frustrated because by the time I realized I was never getting my package, it was too late to do anything about it. Grrrrrr!


Now I can have another chance to get some. Yay!


And I'm happy for all those people, present and future, that will benefit from kratom being available for longer. Hopefully it stays legal forever.


Part of me thinks the DEA may actually let kratom stay legal. That way, the next time they go all nazi banning shit they can atleast say "remember kratom? We listened to the public and did what was "right"". It'll be like a free pass/excuse for them to be even worse in the future... But who knows, I'm just thinking out loud.

I hope their reasoning is that it'll be like a marijuana 2.0 and they'll just slap an age restriction and tax on it instead. It would make a lot of sense and would make both sides fairly happy. I doubt they'll leave it completely unregulated though.

Just had one of the best experiences with Kratom the past two nights.


Last night used a green vein, tonight used a red.


Very, very pleased with this plant, and amazed what it does for my anxiety.


I've taken it about 4 days out of the last 7 though, so I will be taking a week off.


Luckily I've used different strains almost every time, so that helps.


Really hope it stays legal after the new date, this is a great plant that I think helps a lot of people out, but only if used with respect.


Have a nice stockpile, and will be ordering more to add to it.


I took around 8G of a horned red tonight, and have just been blasted. More so than than any other opiate I've ever tried (only done oxy a handful of times and at very low doses).


The general lack of significant respiratory depression is a huge benefit for me.


Def. won't take everyday though, so a week off it is. Really impressed by Kratom!

I'm not so optimistic.


I think it's REALLY  important people continue to make even more calls and emails during the DEA's "comment period" but it doesn't seem enough people around here are.


I will make some myself once I figure out how.


I think that the DEA  is banking on people having blown their wad already and then when not enough people respond during their comment period because they already responded before they will say "see, we gave you guys a few months to respond and you didn't respond much so we are making it illegal".


Then we'll all be like "yeah  but we got 120,000 plus signatures BEFORE the comment period" and they'll be like "all that did was earn you the right to have a comment period which you didn't even use, and now we are scheduling it".


I do NOT like two things about your average drug user:  1) they are overly optimistic about things like these 2) they are often lazy and unwilling to take the necessary actions in a situation like this to keep their drug legal when they can.


I think that unfortunately the DEA may just be playing a "long game" now, expecting us to calm down because we think we won, and then just scheduling it at a later date.


I think we can only potentially stop the ban IF WE CONTINUE TO MAKE LOTS AND LOTS OF NOISE LIKE WE DID LAST MONTH!!!


Do NOT be foolish and think that the  EVIL DEA  is just "letting this slide".


We already have strong evidence that big pharma is trying to make drugs out of Kratom's alkaloids and is probably paying off or influencing the DEA.


**The DEA STILL wants Kratom illegal if they can do so and I'd make a money bet with anyone who thinks otherwise.

****

STOP being overly optimistic and get active on making SURE Kratom STAYS legal!!!**


Don't just drop the issue  and be hopeful or we will lose this war.

It should be regulated, but it won't be unless its scheduled. Supplements have little to no regulation. Its highly unlikely it will be made legal a la alcohol or tobacco type situation. Not unless all hell breaks loose post-ban

**Looking for advice on trying Kratom**


So, (mods) I'm not trying to post anything illegal. But, I'm just hoping to maybe speak with some people about using Kratom to taper from real opiods. I'm currently on 25mcg of Fentanyl that is only last 24 hours or less for me, before I start feeling the WDs, and they are horrible. I also have access to x4 Hydros (10/325) a day, that I've had to taper my doses down because I've been using it took much, to help with the WDs from this short acting Fentanyl bs patches that should be lasting 72 hours. They just aren't for me. I'm going to have to cut my patches in halves, maybe even thirds to try and make them last until the beginning of November. So, I'm def gonna need something else to help with all of this, as I am already super sensitive to WDs (PTSD/Anxiety) and a weird metabolism. So, from what I'm learning from the Kratom megathreads and some other stuff on this site, is that some strains are stronger than others, and it seems that the only real issue is actually "pull the trigger" on finding an online store to buy from that is legit, and you won't get in trouble, legally with. I'm in the US (NM), and from what I understand from "headshops" and other places that sell it in the city, is that basically, they are charging you for a bag of (who knows what strain), and about three times more than what you would pay, just ordering the powder yourself. And apparently they put them in capsules for you, but you are paying for that convenience and getting about 30grams for what you could get 100 for. I'm not looking to spend a lot of money, as I am currently out of work on disability, and cannot deal with trying to maintain a job while going through WDs. So, it does actually matter what the best way to spend my $$ is going to be. Again, I'm not trying to ask for anything illegal here, just looking for advice. If there is an issue with this, I hope someone could maybe PM me, and guide me here, as I really need some good advice right now in my life. Everything else has been really shitty for me lately, and I really am trying to turn it around. Thanks guys!

Really, really pleased with Kratom. Have about 4 different strains now, and just very intrigued by this unique plant. 


My current question is: Do you think dosing two days a week would be ok, and not cause any type of withdrawal?  The most I plan on doing is 6-7G.

That dose twice a week won't lead to withdrawal.

3) many are "in the closet" as drug users...and do not want to communicte to anyone that they are because they are paranoid about breaking the law constantly and someone finding out.   its an attitude where they support kratom, but just isn't worth anyone finding out they use drugs to do something about it

Hi I just ordered my 2nd kratom batch from a different company, and I gotta say this one is wayy more potent like 4g=7,5g of the last batch and I can get a bigger effect with less probability of nausea, it is also slightly different (always used red vein) it is more painkilling and relaxing while the other was more blurry feeling, this batch with 5g feels like I took 20mg oxy without the reduction in concentration, memory and cognition and the painkilling effect is even more pronounced. Is that normal to see such a different effect from 2 company or is it just that sometimes a batch is more or less potent? I changed strain from boreno red to red horn, could that be it? Anyway I am happy I bought enough for a long time even tho I am not worried about it being schedueld since I live in canada and they didnt really talk about it. 

My soulder is injured and it is really relieving since all the doc gave me was anti-inflamtory drug which helps but when you are in pain 24/7 for 5 weeks you kinda want a break once in a while. And this plant works great!

It could just be a stronger batch but I'd be more willing to bet you're noticing the difference in feel simply because you changed strains. Even though they are both red veins the alkaloid profile will be a little different than what you're used to. 


My main red strain is Kalimantan and when I bought some red horn  instead I noticed it was more energizing and longer lasting than Kalimantan but less euphoric,  similar to a red Thai  in terms of stimulation.

Just ordered some 'Super Green' from a reliable source, bought some gel capsules to go with it. Hoping this works out, as I am down to 1 1/2 25mcg Fentanyl patches and x4 12mcg patches. Starting my first day going from 25mcg to 12.5mcg. Also, noticed that putting it on my arm, as opposed to my chest, the effects were MUCH slower to come on. I'm hoping that translates to it lasting a little longer. Also, just plugged x3 10/325 Hydros, with only 10 left, and going to try to make that last until I get my order. Really hoping this works out to get me through an already incredibly stressful month. I feel like I can see the light at the end of the tunnel, I've just never tried Kratom before, and hoping it can substitute my opiate addiction, as well as manage some of my constant pain. And, at the end of it, hopefully Kratom will be easier to tapper off of. Any motivation or tips, I would greatly appreciate. Thanks guys! ![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif)

I'm currently trying to come off of opiates (25mcg Fentanyl patches, and x4 hydrocodone (10/325) a day. I just ordered Kratom for the first time and really hope it ends up working out. I ordered 'Super Green'? After doing  little research, I realized I probably should have ordered a 'bali' strain, as those are what people claim to have the most "opiate like" effect. Can anyone confirm or deny this, or give some insight into how I'm going to do? I also read conflicting stuff about making it as a tea, or just putting them in gel capsules for that method (I bought some of those just in case). Just looking to get some info, sorry Kratom noob here. Thanks! ![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif)

Bali is probably the most sedating kratom strain but most other red veins will do the job, don't count out green strains though. I would only do tea if you can't stomach the powder. Capsules will work, I use and recommend the "000" size as you can get 1+ grams in each. Or you can just mix it in water or OJ and chug it. With your tolerance I would start at 5 grams and work up from there.

**Question about kratom's mental withdrawal**


Hi everybody !

I discovered kratom three months ago and I would like to have some information from more experienced users please.

I am well aware of the potential addictive nature of kratom, that is why I try to take at least two days off between doses.

However, there has been a week during which I did kratom every day, two times a day (my average dose is between 3 and 5 grams), and the next day without kratom I was physically normal but I felt depressed like never before. After a couple of days without kratom I was back to normal.

My question : Do you think it is possible that this depressive feeling I experienced could be a mental withdrawal ? Or my kratom usage is too short/low for experiencing any withdrawal. I am also going through a little bit tough period of my life right now so maybe it is a normal feeling.


PS : I am not totally opiate naive, about seven years ago, I regularly snorted very very small amount of heroin or buprenorphine on a daily basis during approximately one year and I quitted cold turkey without experiencing any withdrawal.


Thank you very much in advance, dear friends, and greetings from France


Baboune

Hi fellow bluelighters, I have a question for those who have spent some time reading about kratom experiences on this board. I've used the search function and haven't really found anything. So my question is this: Has anyone ever heard of kratom use resulting in a false positive in a drug test? This is just a standard pre-employment drug test. I've passed one in the past while being on heavy doses of oxycodone, but I'm a little concerned about kratom messing me up. I don't currently take anything except kratom. Thanks.

You should be fine. There's 0 chance they're testing for kratom alkaloids, and they're very different from opiates

A little worried about some possible heart toxicity reports I've read regarding Kratom? I take Prozac, which can prolong the QT interval a bit, and it seems the main alkaloid in Kratom does as well. Should I be worried about this?

I took Kratom on Prozac with zero issues and now I take Lexapro which is a similar SSRI to Prozac and have used Kratom on it with no issues.


In fact, there were only a few times I EVER used Kratom I wasnt' on some kind of SSRI.


I think there's no reason for concern at all.

So, I'm confused on how it's working for me (first time user). The first time I did the two big scoops in my mouth, and wash with water. Awful. No effect. 2nd try: Made the tea, 3 big scoops. Gross. No effect. 3rd times the charm, I make pills with empty gel caps, swallow 13 (Probably about 500-600mg per so about 6-7g). Awesome effect, very opiod-esque. 4th time, same amount of pills later that night. Terrible effects. Sweating and anxiety. No euphoria. 5th time: Same amount of pills. No effect, bad or good. 6th time: Same amount of pills. No effect again. Very confused and frustrated... Can anyone shed some light? I bought a 'Super Green' strain, that I had high hopes for. Aside from that 3rd time, which was awesome, I feel like I'm missing something. Thanks in advance.

I'm only wearing x1 12mcg Fentanyl Patch atm. I would have figured that would be low enough to take effect. So, I'm guessing there is a set amount of grams you don't want to go over at once or in one day? Any general ranges for these would be appreciated it. I want to say, now that my scale came, 13 of them was about 9 grams, based on how tight I packed them. So, I'm just not sure if I'm taking too many or not enough. I tried lowering my doses today, and still haven't found that "sweet-spot" again.

The difference between a kratom high and six hours of very mild analgesia and light sedation is stomach contents, in my experience.

If I ingest doses over four grams on anything but an empty stomach, the perceivable high is drastically effected; obviously ymmv, but something to bear in mind.


Fwiw, I've found that less is sometimes more with this stuff- take breaks and try to avoid pushing your dosage too high into the two digit range (I've found it useful to avoid accounting for tolerance when calculating dosage; if my usual dose doesn't work, it's time to stop until it does.)

Hope this heeeeelpsssssssss

Yep, I find this to be true, now. I also think taking a medication like Prilosec for heartburn DOES NOT HELP the Kratom high. I think it had alot to do with the fact that I had just thrown up, and thus had more stomach acid in it, on an empty stomach. It still nearly took 1 1/2-2 hours for it to kick in, without ingesting anything else besides water or Gatorade. Today, my 10g doesn't feel AS good as last nights, but I still feel it a little. The difference? I took Prilosec early this morning. Waited till about 4pm to take it, and still feel like my stomach acid is just not breaking it down fast enough.

I used a lot of Kratom for 2 years and never felt i needed to have an empty stomach for good effects at all.


Then again, I also did not follow the very smart advice you gave about not continuing to raise your dosage.


Mine got as high as an ounce to get me high at one point, at which point I took a break.


But consistently I got good effects from around 14 grams a dose.


That's a high dose for a lot of people, but I'd still have needed a lot on an empty stomach.


Granted, I do remember getting even more high when using it on an empty stomach, but that wasn't at all necessary for me, and I never liked starving myself to get high.


My highs also never lasted six hours, more like 4.


Of all the things people say about Kratom, that has never been true for me, but I'm sure it is for some.

@mycophile-

Interesting, thanks for the input regarding my empty stomach comment!

An ounce...yeah, man, I've been there too, and 14G used to be my sweet spot as well.

I generally note a pretty major reduction (x<40% by my totally unscientific guestimation) in efficacy taking it on an empty stomach, but thank you for pointing out that this doesn't necessarily hold true for everyone

Hi!


What strain/type do you think is easiest to get off kratom?


For instance, when I had a heavy benzo habit, getting off klonopin/clonazepam was a million times easier than getting off xanax/alprazolam or valium/diazepam.


See what I am asking?


Thank you!

^ It's subjective.. certain strains have different effects. Some are more 'opiate' like, and some are more stimulating.. so it depends on what you're shooting for.

In general, the most efficacious strain for whatever condition you are treating/effect you are trying to achieve will be the most difficult to stop using (psychologically, not physiologically)

If you treat pain with kratom, the more opiate-like strains would (likely) be more difficuly to come off.

If you use kratom as a prosocial tool, the more stimulating strains would (likely) be more difficult to come off.

"stem & vien" kratom is generally reported to be good for lowering tolerance to other strains due to its differing alkaloid content. The only catch is that larger doses of stem & vain are subjectively nicer IMO (more opiate-like than others) so while it may be good for lowering tolerance to other strains, it could potentially be worse if trying to quit altogether.

I was also going to mention this. Using stem and vein is supposed to be good for reducing tolerance or tapering use, but you of course still need to actually reduce your doses!

I have two separate things I want to discuss:


I've noticed an increase in night time erections while sleeping during the night after dosing kratom. It's occuring 6 to 16hrs after dosing and it only occurs while sleeping.


I fall asleep fine but I tend to wake up a million times a night normally and if I have dosed kratom earlier in the day, I wake up with an erection that won't go away easily. I wake up quite often and it seems I have a constant erection the entire night sometimes. It takes awhile to go down after waking up (atleast 20 minutes). It becomes quite uncomfortable and annoying at times.


Does anyone else have this problem or atleast have heard of it? I have taken, experimented and abused an awfully long list of substances and have never experienced anything like this (excluding Viagra or Cialis)


I can only guess that kratom (or rather kratom metabolites, considering this occurs 6 to 16 hrs after dosing) is effecting blood vessels/flow.


It's just odd though, because I can have a normal erection before bed and it would go down normnory but if I wake up with these "kratom erections" they last a long time and become bothersome.


_____________________


A kratom high is generally considered to only last a few hours... Like 3 or 4 right?


I'm sure this is variable based on many factors (individual, drug, dose, etc) but for about how long would a 10g dose of kratom be expected to keep someone out of opiate withdrawals for?


Thank you

Got a Beginner's Pack from a place. Red Vein Meng Da, Green Vein Malay, and White Vein Bali. Looked like a deal to me. (Been researching.) This will be my first time, so I plan on taking it slow and seeing how my body handles it. Any suggestions from other Kratom users? Should I be concerned about potential interactions with hydrochlorathizide, spironolactine, furosomide, omeprazole, and Advair Diskus Inahaler? Also, hearing a lot about potential liver toxicity, I'm taking Milk Thistle, as I'm on an aspirin regimen for my osteoarthritis. 175mg of Milk Thistle three times a day. (Self administered, that last one.)


I plan on using a low dose in the morning for productivity, and an opiate dose at night. I'm a big guy, about 460 with mild hypertension. (Ergo the hydrochlorathizide.) Other than that, only problems I've had is light atherosclerosis. I do have gastric reflux (ergo the omeprazole) and I smoke about two packs a day, though I am switching to vape and hopefully staying on it this time. I do not drink (very little, anyways) As in I used to drink about once a year or so, and would drink heavily at one time. I don't drink now, as my meds dinnae like the alcohol, LOL I was administered mobic for osteoarthritis pain. but have discontinued (self) after seeing some reactions I didn't like.


Also, as I am on the meds for fluid retention specifically, should I be worried about the main toxicology post-mortem issue with many of these so-called Kratom deaths, which is "pulmonary congestion and edema and a distended bladder, both of which are consistent with, though not diagnostic of, opiate use."--https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232526745_A_Drug_Fatality_Involving_Kratom


I know Kratom's effect largely vary by individual, but I don't want to do anything stupid (moreso than smoking and eating the wrong things) and end up as one of the rare statistics of fatality in cases which involved (along with a shitton of other drugs usually) Kratom. I won't take it if I think there's a serious risk here. :/

Been having some inner thigh pain/shin pain for the past day or so, especially today. I've taken Kratom 4 out of the last 5 days, but only at doses of 6g max. 


I'm also in the process of tapering my Valium, and have gotten down to 6mg from 6.5mg.


Should this be something to worry about?

IMO you last two guys are worrying too much.


I feel that Kratom is probably quite benign and reports of liver toxicity only come from rare cases of people who for whatever reason can't seem to metabolize it.


I've looked at a few of the reports out there but I still haven't seen a clear cut death attributed to Kratom alone.


There are reports it might be able to make Long QT syndrome worse if you have it, but that particular Web MD report didn't really indicate whether or not they thought it could cause it, and it seemed they weren't saying for sure it could, and also, they were talking about isolated alkaloids, not the whole plant.


Of course, we still don't really know a whole lot about the long term health effects of regular Kratom use and HOPEFULLY it will stay legal but one good thing that COULD come out of the attention the DEA and FDA have brought to it would be actual scientific studies being run.


I'm going to be pessimistically realistic though, and say that I don't even believe it will probably be legal past December 1st and that not many LEGIT tests will be run.


It would be great if INSTEAD of trying to help the DEA ban Kratom, the FDA just did quality control on it like it was food and made sure there were no extra additives, and more scientists studied it.


But to you guys worrying about every little possible medical concern here, I wouldn't spend much time thinking about it.


I took MOUNTAINS of it and really felt like it was pretty benign.


I REALLY hope it stays legal.

Top it all off, never been much of a rec user myself up until a year or so ago. Someone gave me an oxy for pain, and I try to get some when I can. My tolerance is decent, but that's only to the amount I generally take, infrequently, which is usually 10-15mg at nighttime, just before I go to bed. Usually for a week or so in a row. Then I go off until I can get some more, and there's usually a fine wait on that. And I know already 15-20mg is small league dosage with these as well. So there's that too, LOL

What else are you taking with Kratom??


Cause I know what you mean, Kratom isn't well studied enough that we could know of all possible interactions but from my personal usage there would be barely anything I personally have used it be afraid of mixing it with.


NOW the thing is, which SOME of you seem NOT to realize, that if we don't get off our asses and start REALLY making noise to the politicians about Kratom  (I've already made a phone call to my representative, signed online petitions and sent emails) that Kratom will probably be illegal as of  December 1st.


Are you guys aware of this???


Cause some of you newer posters all interested in Kratom seem to have some bad timing if you do...


That's just one reason why I'm not even buying more now even though I want to:  it's already been 7 weeks or so since I've used it and I'm thinking about it less, and I don't feel like stocking up on Kilos, so why would I want to re-introduce myself to a drug I love only to have it taken away a month later???


I figure I might as well try to get over it and move on.


I mean it MIGHT stay legal after December 1st as over 120,000 people and nine senators signed the petition, BUT, the DEA and FDA are STILL trying to make it illegal, and they might end up having their way, even as HORRIBLY corrupt as it is.


The DEA is EVIL and it should stay legal, BUT, lets  be realistic guys.


You are probably getting yourself into something that you won't have access to it in 6 weeks unless you decide to buy several kilos worth and stock up.

I'm hoping that it stays legal.


Yes it was VERY unprecedented and a step in the right direction, but I hope it doesn't just stop there and stays legal.


It's my favorite drug ever other than maybe shrooms and I  want to continue to have access to it.


But I really don't know the answers to your questions here man, and I'm not sure if anyone here can claim to for sure.


I very much doubt it would have negative reactions with a steroid inhaler, Asprin, Milk Thistle or omeprazole and I wouldn't hesitate to mix it with them, but I don't have much familiarity with the other substances you are talking about.


As mentioned, I don't think Kratom is toxic to most people's livers.


I really don't know much about the issue of fluid retention, I'm not a doctor.


One thing about your night time dosage, FOR ME and many others Kratom keeps them up at night, but some others sleep on it just fine.


I personally could not sleep a wink unless the Kratom had WORN OFF about 6 hours prior to bedtime, but this may not be an issue for you.


I recommend trying to keep your dosage low and not using more than about 3 days a week so you don't get addicted, but even if you do I didn't find the withdrawals to be very bad but I was VERY strict about NEVER using it more than 4 days a week.


As for strains, they tend to differ based on vendor and are not always the same across the board so I'm not sure how much name always matters, but red strains are usually more sedating, white more stimulating and green in the middle.


Green Malay is my favorite strain followed by Red Bali.


If you want to toss and wash thats how I do it, just put a VERY small amount in my bottom lip like if it were chewing tobacco  (I suggest NOT putting more than a teaspoon in your mouth at one time) and wash it down with water...but beware it doesn't taste good and many people HATE it more than I do and do NOT put too much in your mouth at once or you could choke on it on the way down as it is very gritty like a ground herb would be.


There are other ways to take it but toss n' wash is the only I've used.


It takes about 45 mins to kick in and lasts about 4 hours.


I would personally not eat a LOT before you take it and during the first two hours of the experience as that can dull it, but I don't starve myself to get high off it like others do either.


Many people think you HAVE to take it on an empty stomach to get high and I've found that to be false in my case BUT you will almost certainly get higher the longer you go without food before taking it.


You might perhaps find you don't get as high as some people if you've eaten a lot prior to it as you said you are a big guy, and I wouldn't want to ruin the experience, so I'd just suggest not eating for 2 hours prior and then not again till it's worn off.


You say you have stomach issues and Kratom gives SOME people stomach aches so I might suggest taking some Pepto Bismol or something like that if it bothers you as that has helped with me, but usually my stomach tolerates it fine.


As you've probably heard, many compare it to a low dose of Vicodin with some stimulant effects as well.


Just a really nice mood boost and puts me in a great mood.

Maybe you strained them in some way while on Kratom without noticing since Kratom is a mild pain killer, and then noticed them when it wore off??


That's all I could imagine.


I wouldn't worry about it much.

The effects of Kratom for me* are 110% linked to stomach contents and acidity. Empty stomach = Good times. Empty stomach and NOT taking antacid medication = BEST times. ANY amount of food = Almost ZERO effect for me.

Yeah, it's that way for some people, just not me.


I mean in those situations where that happened did you just keeping take more to see if EVENTUALLY you'd get a good effect and if so did it STILL not work??


I'd assume a higher dosage would work if you had a full stomach, at least for me it did, but maybe not for you.

Possibly, but I just don't like the idea of putting more than 10g of that stuff, in one sitting. Double digits is already too much imo. Especially when you would think you have to take it 2-4 times a day. Which is a lot. I've noticed so far since taking it, I am urinating a LOT more than normally. I don't think it's quite affected me like a fiber in that department yet lol.

Thanks for your reply! It's very informative, and I agree with you on how people react individually to it. I also appreciate that you didn't try to provide an answer for those medications you weren't familiar with. Some people try to defend Kratom to the point of addressing all concerns with the statement "it's *completely* harmless." I'm glad you are sensitive enough to admit a lack of understanding where you deem necessary. Honest dialogues like this are what will keep Kratom legal, should it remain so. And even many prestigious and formally educated people are admitting the DEA overstepped its bounds with its arbitrary attempt at Prohibition II, LOL I think that helps also, as many people are under the influence (no pun intended, LOL) that those defending Kratom so vehemently are just junkies and faux meth addicts, and shit like that. Boards like Bluelight and posters like you help to show people that's not the case. So again, thank you! ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

^ The answer is strain dependent. But if you get a strain that is high in mitragynine (the opiate metabolite), I would say you're going to want to dose at least 4 or 5 grams. The onset of action takes about 15-45 minutes, so I'd wait 45 minutes to redose if necessary. Red vein has more of an opiate like effect, white vein has more stimulant properties and green vein is a mix of both. Although both effects can be felt with all strains.. generally lower doses procure the stimulant effects, while high doses generate the opiate like effects.

Same here :/ I know the feeling.


When I first tried kratom 2 years ago, I was clean from all opiates for 2 years at the time. (I was addicted years ago, then went on suboxone for 1.5 years, tapered off and remained clean for 2). 


So I was finally free of the monkey for two full years and I started taking kratom. All I needed was 1 or 2 gram doses and I was happy. I kept it under control and didn't use often enough to get hooked. I loved it.


Then I got cocky and tried Tianeptine. Thought I could use it occasionally in small doses like I had been doing with kratom. Wrong, so utterly fucking wrong.. My Tianeptine doses instantly spiralled out of control, I was constantly redosing and I found myself very quickly dependent. I've been using it nonstop now for the last 1.5 years or so.


I'm tapering off Tianeptine now and plan on switching to kratom for the final taper stretch. I need to get lower on Tianeptine first. I was at 3g of sodium salt per day at the worst. Currently I'm down to 1g of free acid spread throughout the day. I've made good progress but have a lot more tapering to do.


It sucks though. I really enjoy kratom and I miss what it used to be for me. Lately I have been experimenting to discover where my kratom tolerance is at. In the beginning 1 or 2 grams was a pleasant 3 or 4 hour experience. But lately Ive been trying bigger and bigger doses and not getting much out of it.


Yesterday I tried my largest kratom dose to date: 12 grams and felt a short mild buzz for only 45 minutes followed by absence of any Tianeptine withdrawals for only another 3 hours. I might try 16g next, but I don't want to waste anymore of my kratom. I should keep what I have for the final stretch instead of wasting it on increasing bigger doses that aren't doing much... Though the 12g dose was promising though mild...

Try splitting your normal dose for the day into two doses spread out by 5-6 hours, less is really more with the self-limiting kratom. If you take too much too often, it will produce a higher side effect:desirable effect ratio than by taking reasonable amount (4-8g a day) split into smaller doses.


Also, keep in mind that tianeptine is a hardcore opioid relative to the μ-opioid receptor agonist alkaloids found in kratom. If you're looking to chase some sort of super-powerful opioid effect out of kratom, it's just not going to happen.

I don't know if this will help anyone either, who caps their Kratom, like myself. I was using the '0' sized pills at first, but quickly switched to the '000' size, based on another users recommend. It has made a decent difference for me. Less of the "gelatin" in your stomach to get through, and more "space" for the Kratom to fill. If I pack them tight, I can basically get 3g in two pills. Taking less of them, gives me greater effect and cuts down on the time it takes to come on. I'm trying so hard to not go above 10g, hell I don't even like being that high to begin with, and I honestly didn't think my tolerance was that high. 12mcg of Fent is like 30 oxy oral. So, recommending 4-5g for the guy who is on 40-50mg of Methadone, just might be an understatement. Just saying from my own experience, but then again, my stomach pH and stuff are waaay wacked out, so it could be different.

I never used the gelatin caps, isn't it like pig skin or something? Whatever it is, it can't be good for your system. There are vegetable capsules that are much safer for your digestive system.

This is true. Eating before taking Kratom pretty much killed any effect for me too when I used to take it. You have to take it on an empty stomach to get full benefits. I did notice that after a while, I would get the munchies and eating on it made the Kratom feel even better. I used to really be into it years ago. I can't even remember the last time I took it. It used to help with anxiety and put me in a good mood. It stopped working for me long ago and I only felt side effects.


I'm really glad it's still available (for now), simply for the fact it's a miracle for anyone going through withdrawals.


This part isn't directed at you Pixies, just saying in general: As someone mentioned earlier, this is not a good time to get hooked on Kratom. Who knows when the DEA will finally have their way. If you're not looking to get a "high" and you're only battling withdrawals, take advantage of it now while it's still around and try to get off whatever opiate you need to.

I take neixum every AM, but, I've noticed that grapefruit juice really kicks in relief for me, I got a pound of citric-acid for $6- I added a pinch to water and it's tastier - I'm gonna try drinking it with Kratom. 

I was in horrible WD today and took ~15 grams and it really saved me.

I feel like even the acid in coke,  if I drink it with kratom, helps a lil with the relief.

Okay, I know what people say about Kratom and Calcium, esp. Milk. (That is, they taper the effects of the Kratom.) What about cocoa packets? (Not *that *cocoa, LMAO) They have hardly enough amounts of either to qualify, right? I'm pretty sure Kratom on a completely empty stomach will make me sick, as I have GERD. 


Anyways, to the main point of my post. Still researching Kratom before I make the jump and came across a listing in Google which said "DEA intelligence brief"--half quoting there, LOL I dun remember the full title--and it seems a step in the right direction if true. (And as it leads to nim.nih, I'm sure it is.)

Hey guys,


I've used Kratom on and off for the past 2 weeks, and lately have had some bad leg and arms cramps. The leg cramps go all the way up into my thighs. 


I've never really had these before, and think they are somehow Kratom related? If I cut my usage back to 2 days a week, I'm sure it would be fine. Should I be worried? Could this be a sign of bad circulation while on Kratom?

From what I remember about Kratom in the past is after taking it for a week or more nonstop, my legs would hurt just like yours. It was painful and annoying, it would keep me from sleeping. I think it causes a mineral deficiency. It's very uncomfortable. I think it's a lack of potassium. I usually have Bragg's organic apple cider vinegar around so I would drink a few tablespoons in a glass of water because it's full of potassium. Or eat some bananas. When I noticed those awful leg cramps, I would take a break from it. Those cramps ruin the whole experience.

Oh thank goodness! I thought I was having circulatory issues or something, but my blood pressure and whatnot was fine.


I'm on an antibiotic right now where I can't take potassium with it, so I'm just gonna wait to finish the meds and then my tolerance will be nice and low by then. 


Thanks for the post man!

If your on the right antibiotic, man, I'm think azythro and maybe doxy, the have pretty great anti-inflammatory action by working against some proteins that cause inflammation.

Do you think bannanas or something like Celtic Sea Salt (recommended to me by a physical therapist) or even gatorade would help potassium deficiency as apple cider vinegar does??


I've never had these potassium issues with Kratom, but i do get low potassium/electrolytes at times so this info might help.


Thanks

I LOVE Celtic Sea Salt!!! Thank you for reminding me to get more. That could help. It's packed with plenty of essential minerals that you need. It does happen to include potassium.


"A quarter-teaspoon of Celtic sea salt contains 601.25 milligrams of chloride, 460 milligrams of sodium and 2.7 milligrams of potassium, according to CureZone.com."


Yes, bananas for sure. That's another natural source full of potassium.


Celtic Sea Salt is also perfect after a work out when you're tired because it recovers the body and makes you feel strong, refreshed and energized.

Even if you can't get potassium, the leg problem will go away on its own if you take a break from the Kratom.

 I know what you mean. I used to hate that feeling from all those capsules. The least I could do was make sure it was vegetable capsules and not those gross gelatin capsules. Drinking a hot cup of tea (Liptons or whatever) after swallowing all those capsules helps to melt the capsules in your system.

Kratom WD is probably a toned down version of your classic: day1-day6 with days 3-5 being the worst.

Only thing I can think of is competitive inhibition of liver enzymes. I would just look up metabolism of kratom of bacteria. Even then you would be fine if you just lowered doses.

I'm a little worried about the whole QT prolongation thing.


As I stayed earlier, I take Prozac, which in some cases is said to prolong the QT.


Apparently Bactrim can in some people too, but I can't seem to find a clear answer.


Also, it's said mitragyna prolongs the QT somewhat, but also effects potassium levels, which Bactrim can too?


I don't know, I feel over my head with all this shit. My anxiety is getting the best of me, but I also just wanna make sure I'll be ok.

Like I said, I've taken Kratom plenty of times on Lexapro and Prozac with no issues.


I also think the Web Md article is essentially saying that if you ALREADY have Long QT syndrome it could make it worse, NOT that it can cause it, AND they were talking about isolated Kratom alkaloids, not the whole plant.


As one knowledgable poster pointed out, Kratom has so many different alkaloids and some of them could possibly cancel out other effects of the others, so to simply isolate ONE of the MANY alkaloids in Kratom and then say it COULD worsen Long QT syndrome  IF you have it is not a statement even REMOTELY close to saying if you DON'T have Long QT sydrome or a history of it in your family that the ENTIRE PLANT could CAUSE you to get it...but nevertheless no one can INSURE 100% that you "will be ok", it's just not possible.


Also I don't think you are speaking properly to say it "Mitragyna prolongs the QT".


 I don't think that study showed definitely that it can do that, only that it could POSSIBLY effect those who already have Long QT syndrome.


I don't know much about Bactrim though.


I went through an entire freak out about that report myself and then stopped worrying about it for the aforementioned reasons and because I'd just so many times felt fine taking it.


I think you don't have much to worry about, but if you are that worried then just don't take Kratom.


You'll have to decide one way or another on your own.

Thanks a lot for the post Mycophile... I have really bad anxiety and OCD, hence the obsessing... I recently made a cut in my Valium, down to 6mg, do I'm sure that's adding to it as well. Also,


been on a lot of antibiotics lately which is also causing me anxiety, but I definitely have always felt fine on Kratom. I will continue to take this great plant, and just not worry. Thanks man!

Does anyone have analytical data on the different substituents of varying kratom colors?  This seems to be real hard to find...


What I mean is quantified values for the alkaloid content of different strains.  Thanks!

^ @ I are spectre That would be nice. But there's over 40 active compounds in its leaves, and they vary in content from growing locations, even from plant to plant... Definitive results are difficult to procure. The general rule of thumb is white is stimulating, red is sedating, and green is a mix of both. Also a lower dose is more stimulating, while higher doses produce more opiate like effects.

No. Maybe it is like the resin on cannabis flowers and changes chemistry & effect with color changes. Just know green is supposed to be the sativa, if you will, and red the indica - of kratom.

I am having allergy testing done tomorrow. Does anyone know if using Kratom could effect the results? I wanted to take some tonight.


Oh well, I've taken it yesterday, so might taking it tonight won't make a difference if it's gonna mess up the results. Guess I'll find out tomorrow.

One; there is no standardized kratom testing procedure in place for drug tests. Two; if I'm not mistaken, there is a rule on non-discussion policies about drug testing in the BL forums. I'll look that up and link here when I find it.

I don't know if it would effect allergy tests, but my eczema is pretty badly effected by Kratom.


Whether or not that's actually a Kratom allergy I don't know, cause I have bad eczema one way or another, and most days I take Kratom I won't have a flare up, but it makes them worse and more frequent.


In fact, most opiates/opioids cause itching and make things like eczema and sometimes maybe psoriasis worse.


But when I had allergy testing done they just tested my reactions to the common allergies:  dogs, cats, pollen, etc.


They scratched my skin with small pointy things that had bits of cat hair, dog hair, pollen etc on them and then waited, and my arm was all red and gross where they scratched it, showing I am allergic to all those things.


But assuming they are doing a "scratch test", which is the only kind of allergy test I know of, they aren't going to scratch your arm with Kratom containing materials.


I mean people can be allergic to a billion things other than what they test for in those tests.

I've read that some people find it difficult to sleep if they dose too late due to the stimulation of some of the kratom alkaloids.


For those of you prone to this: How many hours between dose and sleep do you leave to avoid any problems with sleep?


Thank you.

^ The duration needed will differ from each individual and strain.


To avoid the stimulating effects, avoid white leaf kratom and low doses. Typically lower doses give people the stimulating effects, while higher doses give the user more of an opiate like high.

Tried Maeng Da for the first time tonight.


Really, really enjoying it. Very potent, much more than any other strain I've tried.


I only took 4.3G, and have been feeling a great mix between clean energy and pain relief, with a lot of euphoria.


Really like this stuff!

Thanks for the feedback nohandsjoe. I figured it would be different for each individual, tolerance, dose and strain. That's why I'm asking for personal experience. I've heard it's harder for some to sleep after dosing, just curious how long that is for those who experience it.

I'm definitely one of those people and despite what 7-Nos said, for me it doesn't matter what strain I use or how much or little I dose I will still be super stimulated for hours.


I could dose an ounce of the most sedating red strain and I still can't sleep for hours  (I'm actually one of those people who is skeptical about how much difference there really is between strains anyway and I feel like most strains feel similar to me and that the differences between strains is probably overstated...).


Over the past few years, my rule of thumb has been that my last dose has to have WORN OFF AT LEAST six hours prior to when I want to fall asleep, and that's really bare minimum and sometimes isn't even enough...7 or 8 is probably better.


And for me since Kratom takes 45 mins to kick in and lasts about 4 hours, that basically means, for example, that if I want to be asleep by 2AM then I won't dose later than around 3:15PM so that it's worn off by 8PM.


Honestly, if I'm 100% dead set on being SURE I can sleep I will probably take it early enough that it has worn off 8 hours prior to bedtime.


It's strictly a morning or early afternoon drug for me.

Thank you mycophile. I'm starting to realize i probably need about six hours as well between onset of effects and sleep.


Otherwise, I find it difficult to fall asleep and stay asleep. Too much residual stimulation.


I also agree that strain, for me, holds very little difference in terms of effects. But I have a high tolerance at the moment, which may be why I find it difficult to discern differences in effects from various strains.

^^^^


Yeah, I mean I've tried TONS of strains but usually they all feel pretty similar if not exactly the same.


It seems like 9 out of 10 Kratom users think strains play this HUGE difference but I really think a lot of it is placebo.


I remember a few years back Sekio the mod said he ran some tests on different strains and found their chemical compositions to be nearly identical.


I'd really LIKE them to be different because i think it would be cool, but so far I really just usually can't tell the difference.


I remember one time I took this Red Dragon from one vendor and thought that time it felt different and more like a classic opiate than the speedier strains which I often enjoy like Green Malay, and then I took a bunch of white strains from my vendor and didn't like them and felt them all to be much weaker than other strains.


Other than those differences, I haven't noticed many.


I think in a blind taste test you could tell me I took whatever strains you want, white, green or red, and i'd rarely if ever know the difference.


I wonder if we will ever have a way of finding out for sure if there's really a TRUE difference between strains or if it's all just marketing/placebo.

That is, bali, ime, is noticeably different than, say, green malay. The variation wasn't apparent to me until I overdosed on both varieties (when I first found kratom I erroneously thought of it as a replacement for full opioid agonists- wrong!), but high doses of sedating strains feel much different in extremis than stimulating strains (again, ymmv!

Yeah, I'm not saying there necessarily aren't differences, I just have a hard time perceiving them personally IF there are.


I'm just questioning it is all, and saying that the FOR ME the way people describe it typically as white as stimulating, red as sedating and green in the middle, as if this is just some rule of thumb that it is ALWAYS that way...almost like they are all different drugs, I just haven't found it to be true.


I kind of hope that it is true though, cause that would make it more interesting.


And of course personal chemistry plays a HUGE roll with drugs, just like some people can sleep right after taking Kratom and I can't sleep for hours after taking it.


There must be specific reasons why, but I have no clue what the are.

^ Like you said, the differences between red, green, and white are just general rules of thumb. The compounds which induce these effects differ from strain to strain, but also differ from growing locations and from plant to plant. It has been said that dosage also affects what type of high is felt. Lower dosages are stimulating, while higher dosages are said to be more sedating, but this isn't 100% fact either.

I've started a long course of Diflucan today for an infection .


I'm wondering if I need to stay away from Kratom for this period?


Diflucan can prolong the QT, and I've read Kratom can as well ?

Does anyone have trouble finding a kratom dose to relieve WDs? It seems like I've heard that there could be opiate antagonism at large doses.

Interesting.


I don't think large doses of kratom would be a viable way to relieve an OD regardless of whatever antagonism may or may not be occurring. The effects come on too slowly to be of use in most OD situations. And if the antagonism that may or may not be going on is of less than significant intensity, then it seems to me the regular effects of kratom would just compound the issue.


But I'm no scientist and I have no clue how the various alkaloids interact in the human body so... Yea. I just jizzed speculation all over the place. Sorry.


Just curious what you mean by an OD in this situation? Most of the time, an OD is when somebody takes too much and either dies or they come very close to dieing. Though sometimes, users refer to getting more high than they wanted to as an "OD" in a slang sort of way. I'm just curious which one you meant?

This is my first 12+hrs without~75-80% pure #4 afghan heroin, which I snorted a gram in 6 days, and I took 12 grams of green-vein maeng da and I actually feel warm- it has progressed from delirium of WD to warmth just about 4 hours since dose (the only strain I have left, just opened the seal on ~250grams).


Are higher doses good for WD or does it have antagonistic properties at higher doses that aren't at lower doses- kinda like how 1mg of suboxone is as good, sometimes better, than 4-6mg.

In my experience, it's the opposite. Small doses of kratom just seem to produce a slight stimulant effect without much opiate effect whereas larger doses are more opiate like (according to popular opinion as well)


I never got much withdrawal relief from small doses. Like if I try taking 1 or 2 grams I don't feel much relief. And whatever relief I do get is quickly gone within an hour or two of dosing.


Large doses (10+ grams in my experience) provide significantly more relief. At these doses, I can feel almost 100% withdrawal relief for atleast 2 to 3 hours with another 2 to 3 hours where I might slowly feel some withdrawals start to develop. So I get about 5 to 6 hours of decent relief.


With even larger doses (12+ grams) I get the same effects as above but I will even experience a slight buzz for 45 minutes or so. I haven't tried dosing higher than ~12g yet. I'm trying to get my tolerance to opiates down lower before switching to kratom full time (I'm currently hooked on Tianeptine and I have been doing a slow taper with the intention of switching to kratom once I taper low enough).


I dunno, maybe higher doses do have some antagonism... It's possible. There is sort of a ceiling when it comes to kratom doses but I think this comes down to high doses of some of the alkaloids causing too much dizziness, stimulation and naseua. I don't think there is an effect like with bupe where smaller doses act more full agonist like.... But I don't for sure.

I went and read that report, and it seems that Xorkoth, even though I like him, was unable to control himself and not use Kratom only 2-4 days a week, which for me has kept me from avoiding those serious WD symptoms.


But all you have to do is IF YOU CAN just force youself not to use it more than  4 days in a week, and generally no more than 2 days in a  row (I’ve never gone more than 3 in  a row which I can sometimes get away with) and you’ll be fine.


If you take it every single day you can end up with those bad WD symptoms, but it’s still a generally forgiving herb in terms of it’s WD unless you take it to that EXTREME extent.


I think you are being extremely dramatic for no reason.


I LOVE Kratom and hope it stays legal.


I’ve been able to avoid serious addiction, never used it more than 4 days  a week or more than 16 days in a month and the worst withdrawal I ever got was just  4 days of mild depression and a runny nose.


It’s a VERY safe and mild drug.


I mean yes, it’s addictive, but it’s pretty much the safest and least habit forming opioid out there.


I mean what  drugs do you do that you are  SO worried about something as relatively benign as Kratom??


Trust me, it would NOT have “devastating repercussions” LOL, unless you like literally can’t stop yourself from eating an ounce or more every day of your life and eventually have some nasty withdrawal, and even then,  I bet it wouldn’t last more than a week.


Kratom’s non-toxic and there’s only so much trouble you can get yourself in with it.

Dosing kratom seems to be extremely individual. Mytragynine is a partial agonist, but there are many active alkaloids, and mytragynine itself seems to have unique activity at the opioid receptor compared to every other opioid. Not enough is really understood about its activity to say where the ceiling effect or antagonistic activity will really come into play. 


Most every kratom user will tell you that you have to find your "sweet spot" for dosing. For one person, 3-4g could be a sedating dose that gives them plenty of opioid effects, while others need 10+. Best advice is to start low and work your way up. 


I think mycophile is on the money with scheduling doses to avoid addiction. Hes a pretty experienced user and the same is true IME. Dosing frequency seems to have a much bigger impact on dependency than dosing strength.


I get pain relief superior to stronger opioids like oxycodone using kratom every day, but my doses never get out of hand. It's been pretty easy for me to maintain between 6-15g a day without ever going over that. When I take a break, WD aren't bad at all, and the worst of it is over within a day or two. Just my 2c

After a few months without kratom (occasionally took tramadol / O-desmethyltramadol) I had a dose of 7.5 grams of bali yesterday. Heavenly feeling, incredible synergy with weed and such a great and relaxed body high. 

I stopped the kratom usage because I suspected it to constribute to my insomnia. Kratom worked great for me as a sleep aid, then after 3-4 years of usage it always gave me early awakenings. So I stopped the usage almost completely for about a year. I had a few trials within the year, and almost always had bad hangovers, insomnia or early awakenings. The trial yesterday was the complete opposite, I fell asleep instantly when my head hit the pillow and slept like a champion until my bell rang. My mood today was incredibly great, no sign of a hangover. I really hope that I can return to occasional kratom use without sleep problems. Anyone else had problems with kratom and early awakening? I know that a lot of folks have trouble falling asleep on kratom, but I had not read one experience about early awakening.

Yeah, the thing is, it’s not like I can’t get some mildly uncomfortable withdrawal for a day or two if I use too much, but it ends quickly.


My rule is not to dose more than 2 days in a row and not more than 4 in a  week, but occasionally I will break it and pay for it.


I can just force myself to go a few days without and it’s never lasted more than 4 days or been bad for more than 2.


But the more days in a row you use the worse it will be when you stop.


I think the problem is people not realizing ahead of time that it can get bad if you don’t make some rules for yourself so they dose like a week or more in a row before they ever stop for a day to see how they feel and then they realize they are addicted.


You have to be aware enough of it’s potential for WDs to take a day or two off every few days so you know where you are at: then if you take  a day off and you feel really bad then that’s how you know you HAVE to abstain for a few days, because from that point on if you don’t it will get worse.


It’s like building up debt if you don’t take a break or saving money when you take a few days off: when you take a few days off you’ve earned yourself some extra days of fun, and if you do the opposite you’ll have a sucky few days.


Just don’t make the mistake of never stopping to see how your body is feeling without it, cause then you’ll never know you are dependent if you dose the second you wake up.

I just read that kratom POWDER binded to the mu-receptor at 350x-less potency than morphine, which would put it at about 10g of powder equals ~27.8mg of morphine, which if it had 1% alkaloids, would make them 12:1 overall potency relative to morphine with mytriginine contributing to ~65% of the alkaloid content and 7-hmg 2% of the alkaloid total.   ~15.6 grams of kratom would have to be consumed for a ~45mg equanalgesic dose of morphine. 


A BINDING PROFILE THAT IS 350:1 kratom powder:morphine RATIO SHOULD NEVER BE BANNED, IT SHOULD EVEN BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY, IBUPROFEN HAS  A 400:1 ANALGESIC RATIO TO MORPHINE, STOP CRYING, MYCOPHILE, BECAUSE YOU"you find it a lil addicting" THAT IS THE TYPE OF RIDICULOUS TALK THAT PUT THIS INNOCUOUS PLANT UNDER DEA WATCH - GET IT TOGETHER AND STOP WHINING ABOUT THE NON-NEGATIVES OF KRATOM.


It seems like everytime I click on here you are talking about "the addictiveness and wd of kratom should not be underestimated" It has a 350:1 analgesic ratio to morphine in powdered form- get it together! This is literally impossible to abuse due to the shear unpleasantness of volume of consumption - that be like complaining about having a TERRIBLE problem with 3.2% beer....

Found Journal on google, have full access as I am university student

 article titled:

"From Kratom to mitragynine and its derivatives: Physiological and behavioural

effects related to use, abuse, and addiction"

Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews 37 (2013) 138–151


**Pharmacology section - FULL SECTION**

11.1. *Receptor interactions*

Mitragynine displays a high affinity to (MU)-opioid receptors

(Yamamoto et al., 1999). Also its oxidative derivative, mitragynine

pseudoindoxyl, exhibits potent opioid agonistic properties in

vitro. Pharmacological investigations have shown that mitragynine

acts at supraspinal- (MU) and (DELTA)-opioid receptors for its antinociceptive

effects (Matsumoto et al., 1996a; Tohda et al., 1997;

Thongpradichote et al., 1998). However, for other psychoactive

effects, central opioid receptors may be more relevant. The affinity

of mitragynine to (MU)- and (KA)-opioid receptors is considerably lower,

but higher than that of morphine. It was shown that the methoxy

group at the C9 position as well as the Nb lone electron pair in the

fundamental structure are essential for the opioid agonist activity

(Takayama et al., 2002; Taufik Hidayat et al., 2010). A high opioid

receptor potency was found for the minor M. speciosa constituent 7-

HMG, suggesting full agonist properties. **Kratom powder was found

to have a 350-fold less affinity to the (MU)-opioid receptor than morphine**

in a 3H-[D-Ala2,N-MePhe4, Gly-ol]-enkephalin(3H-DAMGO)

radioligand binding assay in HEK 293 cells (Havemann-Reinecke,

2011).

11.2. *Cellular effects*

At cellular level, mitragynine inhibits neurotransmitter release

from the nerve endings at the vas deferens, partly through the

blockade of neuronal Ca2+ channels (Matsumoto et al., 2005b).

The authors proposed the neuronal Ca2+ channel-blocking effect

of mitragynine as a general mechanism for the analgesic and other

physiological actions of mitragynine. In addition, mitragynine was

shown to inhibit forskolin-stimulated cAMP formation in NG108-

15 cells in vitro. This effect could be blocked by the opioid receptor

antagonist naloxone, but not by the alpha-2-adrenoceptor antagonist

idazoxane (Tohda et al., 1997).


**I would have thought it would have a-2-agonist action like clonidine, which adds pain-relief, since it is structurally shaped similar to an a-2-antagonist yhoimbe**

We are all eagerly awaiting an answer. I'm assuming the DEA will release some sort of statement about their decision or announce there ruling today (Dec 1st). Fingers are crossed! I have been doing everything I could for awhile now... I wrote letters, I made donations and I submitted my story to the comment section. Hopefully enough people did the same and hopefully the DEA makes the correct decision. I hate all this anticipation and anxiety.


---------


I have a question and it may be out of line considering forum rules but here I go anyways. I very recently purchased some special Maeng Da strain (there is no need to mention the exact strain name) from a well known and reputable vendor. They are charging more for this particular product then they are charging for their other strains.


I'm asking for opinions here. Do you think I just paid extra for a "brand" name that won't actually be any better or do you think, generally, reputable vendors who charge more for certain strains do so because they actually are better strains. Obviously I don't intend to discuss individual vendors... I'm just curious what people's experiences have been generally speaking. Has it been worth it to shell out a little extra for more expensive strains, have you found it be that it's all really more or less the same or have you found it to be more of a crap shoot. Thanks for any responses.

IME it's a crap shoot. I've paid extra for strains that were garbage, but sometimes it's worth it. There's so much individual variability with kratom that it's hard to say any strain will be objectively better than another

Oh go fuck yourself.


I do have generalized anxiety disorder but I've had it pretty under control lately and it's people like you who probably don't understand how someone with various psychological issues can get have them under control at more times  than others so you've just branded me over how I acted like a year ago when I haven't been like that lately.


I don't even remember PMing you and if I did it was probably over me being pissed due to your insults and telling you to stop bothering me as I do remember you being annoying as hell.


Now go back a few threads and see how many people have complained about me lately and you'll notice: no one other than Mike Vick who's never understood my posts in the first place.


I didn't think Mike Vick was going off an me, and if he was, I was referencing Xoroth's post to a new poster because Xorkoth had written a long report on how horrible Kratom withdrawal was for him and another poster said he was "never going to touch it due to horrible consequences" and I tried to talk the kid out of thinking that Kratom was so addictive.


I was doing the OPPOSITE of saying Kratom is a big deal, and I've learned to manage myself quite well with it.


I certainly was NOT "complaining" about the addictiveness of Kratom, I was doing the EXACT opposite but pointing out for anyone who's concerned (as this new  poster was after reading Xorkoth's story of addiction) that it's not a hard habit to learn to control.


But here you are complaining?


So who's the little girl now?


I've trained BJJ for 20 years and overcome 4 major surgeries to come back to active competition each time.


You couldn't do that.


You're the little girl on my end of things.


Bitch.


Haha, I wouldn't leave an entire FORUM cause of one poster I didn't like, you really are a pussy.


There's lots of good people still contributing like Slow Mobius and Snake Eyes for just a few of many examples.


And for those who "supposedly" couldn't handle it and left?


They can get fucked for all I care and are also little girls IMO.

I don't know if you are talking about me but I don't really post like that very often dude.


I used to back in the day when my anxiety was worse but look back at my posts the past few months and you'll see no fear mongering and nothing but me trying to tell people how to use Kratom responsibly.


What happened was that Xorkoth had posted a long post on Erowid about having had trouble with Kratom and getting addicted to it and how he felt it could be problematic for some people and  some new poster read it and freaked out and said he'd never try Kratom due to "disastrous consequences".


I felt the kid was totally overestimating things because Kratom is really an easy substance to handle unless you take pounds a day like Xorkoth was doing.


So I told the kid to stop worrying about it and making a big deal over it because it isn't.


If you have a problem with someone it should be with the story Xorkoth posted on Erowid, but really you shouldn't because he was just telling his story.


Your another person who seems to have never understood any of the points I've made about Kratom: namely that it's a very tame substance so long as you follow some rules but if you don't you might not feel great for a couple days.


And somehow you make out of those kind of statements some sort of "fear mongering" that I no longer do.


I used to have some issues with that in the past due to my anxiety, but I haven't been like that for a while, so stop trying to claim I'm saying things I haven't said.


Re-read my post and you'll see I was trying to explain to a kid how east it is to use Kratom responsibly.


And while your complaining about me how much action have you been taking??


Cause I've sent NUMEROUS emails to the DEA and signed about 5 petitions and called my local representative.


Unless you've done more you should stop complaining.

Look,  don't take this personally, but look at the length, in centimeters, of your posts compared to everyone elses. Wall of text. Look at the amount of self-referencing. I am not accusing you of anything and I am not accusing you of having narcissistic, or other personality disorders. All I'm saying is chill. This is a kratom thread not a 'mycophile' thread. I'd like to hear from a broader group of people about kratom.

That's all

"you are the only one that doesn't seem to understand my comments on kratom..." Chill dude, get over yourself. We are all one.

Your gigantic posts are all about you, your anxiety, your this, your that. If you want to join the psychology forum, this is not the one. It seems very narcissistic of you to be taking up our time and space with giant, self-referential posts that do not matter.

Moving on, **do you guys find kratom only partially covers WD- the worst parts**: suicidal-ideation, and RLS are completely releaved)? But there is still some WD symptoms that are still not covered by kratom, it doesn't fully substitute for opiates.  That's how I feel. I have taken many grams today - an nearly unpalatable number of grams - and it does not seem to fully substitute for morphine-like drugs.

Only partial attenuation, no drug effects.

Yes, from what I understand, the public commenting period was closed as of Dec 1. I was under the impression the DEA would announce a decision by Dec 31. However, I could be wrong. It's sort of hard to keep up with these days!

I have not talked about anything aside from Kratom for MONTHS.


All I talk about is Kratom and any self reference is only how I react to Kratom, just like you just referred to how you feel Kratom doesn't fully get rid of your stronger opiate withdrawal--that's self reference as well.


Check my recent posts, and all they all have to do with is my opinions on the benefits and drawbacks of Kratom.


As someone who was a graduate student in English, I am long winded by nature and I write a lot about a lot of different topics so all I am guilty of is writing too much for your tastes.


But I have not mentioned my anxiety in ANY recent post I can find.


You are referring to things I said over a year ago.


If you think I talk too much and you'd like me to tone it down so you can hear from others more then I'll try to take that suggestion, but all I am guilty of in any of the recent months is writing posts that are too long, or perhaps more of them than you'd like.

Dude, I Don't care. 

Back to my statement:

** There is certainty that kratom only partially covers WD- the worst parts: suicidal-ideation, and RLS are relieved; But there is still some WD symptoms that are still not covered by kratom. And kratom has no drug-effects alone, even at large doses, so a ban would simply increase Suicidal-ideation and violent, malevolent behavior in opiate addicted patients**- instead of providing availability of some partially-acting, unpalatable-weak, benign drug that is actually helping people reduce suicidal urges and increase function, to no ill affect.

I think it's a bit naive to say that kratom has no drug effects alone and that there are no ill effects. People have died from ODs combining kratom with substances that do not mix well. It's incredibly safe, but it certainly carries some risks that people should be aware of.

Pure kratom alkaloid extraxts, 60 times stronger than kratom powder, has no fatal eeffects in mice, much more than a human can intake. And Every drug overdose that has kratom in the toxicology, has a fatal dose of something else.


Kratom powder is at least 1,000,000,000,000,000 x safer than table salt, by weight.

Can anyone comment on the danger of bombing kratom?    This is how I take it...putting like .75 g into a piece of toilet paper twisting off the end and swalling.    I have almost choked on them when I tried too big of a bomb, but the bomb is so soft that it explodes and i can swallow it eventually.


but i am worried i will choke for real one day.  gel caps would be best but I run out of them sometimes and have to do the bombs

I agree. For the user with no tolerance, kratom can be a decent narcotic.


Mike.vike, you said for you kratom does not alleviate all wd symptoms. I've found this to be true only when tolerance is high enough. For somebody with high tolerance that wants to switch to kratom, they must endure some withdrawals sneaking through for a few days until the body/mind adjusts to only kratom.

I tried kratom as an opiate-intollerant person for the first time like 5 years ago, I had zero effects from 28grams except mild fatigue - But I got dried leaf not powder because I didn't know what I was doin'.


But Yeah, I'd say for when I've done kratom has partial attenuation, on the level of 350:1 kratom-powder:morphine analgesia ratio, as mention in the above study (maybe 1pg back).

Testerday I was consuming 7-12 grams at a time, on a hot-dog-style-folded peice-of-paper, The only relief I had was not obsessing with suicide that heroin WD normally haunts you with, and an 70%-80% ability to function. A LIFE-SAVER, but no drug to me, a benign tea-like herb.


Thank god I just got 20 tramadols and some klonpin- where I can get a 3:1 o-Desmethyltramadol:morphine equivalance - MUCH more soothing at opiating than kratom could ever possibly be.


The previous study mentions feed 200mg/kg-1g/kg oral near pure kratom alkaloids to mice, and all they have is some tiredness, no fatalities.

I don't think it's good HR to tell people that it doesn't have drug effects alone. That simply isn't true because it's a partial agonist at opioid receptors. 


I agree that it's a very safe herb, but I'm certain there could be negative side effects if you were to combine it with the wrong substance, and not every report of kratom overdose was associated with lethal doses of other drugs. Plenty of users report negative effects at high doses, albeit they're typically opioid naive

Just get choclate milk, put 7 grams of kratom (or w/e the dose, I can't do more than ~12g at a time) and then hold a small sip of choclate milk, enough to cover the back of your throat when you tild your head up, and then dump the kratom quickly in your mouth quickly followed by more choclate milk as you swallow, and keep doing that and eventually swishing around till you rinse it all of the powder stuck underneeth of your teeth.


.75g  won't really do shit at all, and bombing has the slight risk of clogging your system or choking I guess, so I would only bomb something 1-2 a year, and only like ecstacy. But I have empty pills now, they are only <snip> for 250 at <snip>, gel caps, <snip> for the veggie caps. Our on <snip>, <snip> for 500-1000 caps.

I am giving my honest assesment of the benign substance. It would exhaust you from taking this drug, and be to slow to metabolize, to be fatal. It's like the girl who got GHB banned because she was the first "ghb death" but turns out later- she just had an unrelated heart attack. Albeit GHB is a far far far more dangerous, low therapeutic range, and an actual drug instead of a benign herb/ tea - the point is there are incorrect death reports, and even with that - kratom alone was blamed for none of the deaths

.

At a 350:1 equanalgesic-ratio of kratom-powder compared to morphine, It is similar in analgesia to ibuprofen at 400:1 ratio compared to morphine....


Except Ibuprofen has a listed/ calculatable LD50 and instances of recorded death from ibuprofen-alone overdoses.

Toxicity is all about dose. Kratom appears to have a high therapeutic index, but I it will kill you at a high enough dose.


You're right that no deaths have been directly implicated on kratom alone. There was one death where a guy died from taking kratom and modafinil. It's not clear if opioid WD was also playing a factor, but after personally trying the combination myself, I wouldn't be surprised if it was a bad interaction. There was some very strong and unpleasant synergy.


I totally agree with you on kratom's safety. I just think we should acknowledge that it's an opioid and that it should be used with some caution. I mean, even cannabis can be dangerous when it's mixed with the wrong drugs and the wrong disorders.

There are lab studies (one I posted 1pg back) that try and kill mice with pure alkaloids and cannot do it. It's safe to say that kratom has a therapeutic index of around marijuana and shrooms - basically, it would be unpalatable - and if you were to die you would likely die from the physical affect of to much plant matter in but not a drug affect. It really is not drug in any sense of the word more of a benign herbal tea w/o any affects besides attenuating suicidal-ideation in opiate-dependent subjects, and partially RLS.

Weed is also benign, contrary to your statement, and has non-fatal/ toxic ability like kratom.

It's the other drugs, I have seen no potential fatal combinations in which cannabis or kratom could play a part, as a contraindication, with another substances lethality.

My 2 cents:  (really TWO, trying to practice keeping my posts shorter now lol…)


This whole (POSSIBLE) ban is making people SUPER sensitive about what they say or don’t say about Kratom for fear that the evil DEA is watching.


And while they are, (to some extent) lets not pretend what we say here matters that much to them.


They’ll make any decision they want IF they can, regardless of the complete lack of “danger to the public”.


They’ve created such a scare in us HARMLESS herb users that we have to try to censor our speech, which puts harm reduction at risk because we feel we can’t talk about ANY single little negative effect a substance may have for fear of the DEA’s backlash.


SHAME ON YOU DEA.


We are not hurting anyone.

Also, for what it's worth: caffeine has been the single most destructive substance in my life, and there's not even an age limit or anywhere other than Mormon country where I've heard of it being opposed, and I feel the WD from caffeine and Kratom feel ALMOST identical minus the runny nose from Kratom and occasional mild RLS.


**(I'm not kidding either, it's REALLY fucked with me worse than hard drugs, but i'm not gonna waste space listing why).


And guess what Kratom withdrawal AT IT'S WORST feels like to me?


EXACTLY like cold turkey caffeine WD, except caffiene WD is WAY worse **cause I have like 18 years of relying on it daily and it's everywhere and ignored by the public as anything to take seriously.


While Kratom has never been much of an issue for me cause I was told to watch myself with it before I got into it (unlike caffeine).


Not much surprised they are related though, seeing as in a blind "WD test" (if such a thing exists) I wouldn't be able to tell for the first few days whether I'm withdrawing from Kratom or coffee, except Kratom WD lasts 3 days for me and caffeine withdrawal lasts like 2 weeks.


I've never successfully broken my caffeine addiction for long, but I've stopped Kratom on a  whim for 90 days at a time.


Food for thought for the evil overlords.


And while it is not harmless, with the amount of Kratom I've taken I fully believe I could try to commit suicide via way of Kratom and I would be 100% unsuccessful 100 times out of 100, with my best chance of succeeding being by way of choking on it on the way down (which is really death by choking not Kratom lol).

Oh god...


I'm glad I've got a fellow Trump hater here.


I'm not much into politics, but I fully believe that before all is said and done he could be the worst president we've ever had and I'm praying we don't see WW3.


The other day he answered a call from the Taiwanese president which I THINK I heard is the first time since 1972 the  U.S. has talked with Taiwan's government for fear of China's backlash cause the two are on such bad terms  and, you know, China is like the most powerful or at least biggest country in the world...


I bet Obama pulled Trump aside and said "listen, I have about 6 weeks to talk some sense into your dumb ass so DO NOT talk to countries we have decided not to involve ourselves with due to international conflict"...


Trump probably replied "F--You N--word!!  I'll  do whatever I  want!!" LOL  


I mean I  don't think Hilary was the best, but how we elected Trump over her....god I just don't get it.


He's a fucking narcisist ego maniac con man snake oil salesman.


And yet half the people I know voted for him, claimed they want their "jobs back" but after Obama unemployment is the lowest it's been this century and will SURELY drop under Trump...


Well, lets not make this a political thread, the damage is already done...

Exactly

3g got me really high a few years ago, I was just laying in bed high as a kite

Taking too much, like 5g resulted in kratom fever and made me really dizzy etc.

While it's really hard/impossible to dose enough to kill you the side effects can be really nasty and it does get you high if you have no opioid tolerance

Even if these adverse effects aren't fatal, they can be pretty damn serious and potentially fatal without prompt medical care.

I'm interested in trying Kratom to see if it can help me with my anxiety, depression and chronic pain. There is so much confusing and conflicting information on the internet and it is pretty overwhelming. Could someone please explain to me the different strains, and how they differ in their effects? Or if not, point me to some useful sources?

I might have a very minor opioid tolerance as I use dihydrocodeine occasionaly, maybe once a week at the very max. I also use diazepam and/or alprazolam the same amount.

In that case, you should start low and work your way up. 2-3g is probably a good starting point for someone that's mostly opioid naive. Start there and wait an hour before taking more. Everyone has very different sweet spots for dosing kratom. 


In general, white strains are more stimulating, red strains are more sedating, and green strains are somewhere in-between. Some people don't think the different vein colors matter, but IME they feel mostly the same if I'm buying from a not so great vendor, but if you find a quality vendor, I think their different products definitely have different effects. For me, white tai is normally the most stimulating, and it can be better for depression than reds. But again, everyone is different, and you'll probably have to do some experimenting before you find your own favorites.


Also, increasing your dose will usually increase feelings of sedation while lower doses are are better for daytime/stimulating effects. A lot of people have trouble sleeping on kratom, so that's something to consider. I can sleep fine after taking kratom, but I seem to be an exception to most people in that regard.

^^^^ Yeah, if you were opiate niave, 3.5g of 3.5% alkaloid kratom (that would be pretty pure, strong powder - ranges from 1%-6% ) would be equalanalgesic to  ~6-10mg of morphine - an analgesic dose to a niave person.


I think at 3.5% potency- I calculated 10g-15g equalanalgesia to be ~28.5mg morphine.

I have generalized anxiety disorder, depression and pain from injuries I got doing martial arts like torn ACLs, a torn wrist ligament, and neck and arm pain, and Kratom is extremely beneficial for all these things.


But if you live in the U.S. I don’t see the point in getting into it since it will probably be illegal very soon.


It’s POSSIBLE it might not become illegal as people are still trying to fight the DEA on it, but I’d say there’s about a 75% chance of it becoming illegal VERY soon.


I’d suggest you only get into it IF we hear that it’s not becoming illegal.


Otherwise there’s no point.


As far as strains, I personally don’t think there’s much difference between them, or at least I personally notice very little difference, but some others disagree completely.


So I can’t say what would help most, but generally people say white is the most stimulating, red the most sedating and green in the middle.


My overall favorite strain is Green Malaysian, but most strains will probably help with anxiety and depression IMO and all should be effective for pain seeing as it’s an opioid.


IF you try it, just try not to become 100% physically dependent on it, or else your depression and anxiety may be worse if you are in withdrawal.

Question:


I just took some stem and vein for the first time and I was wondering what people generally think is different about it from other strains, and also why people say it is better for helping one withdraw from Kratom and other opioids than other strains?


Also, why is it called "stem and vein"?


Is it made of the stems of Kratom?


As it just kicked  in it feels like most other strains, though I am still on elephant as well which hasn't worn off.


Since it may be my last chance if it becomes illegal, I'm going out with a bang and trying every type of strain I can get my hands on.


The ones I have that I have tried or will try soon include:


1) elephant

2) stem & vein

3) Bentuangie

4) Green Vein Riau

5) Red Vein Riau

6) Pleasant Green Bali

7) Yellow Malaysian (first time I've heard  of a yellow strain)

8) Hulu Kapuas


So far I have tried elephant, strem & Vein, Green Vein Riau, Hulu Kapuas and Bentuangie but not the others.


As usual, I can't tell that much of a difference between these strains.


Elephant though seems to be weaker as I have a  MASSIVE tolerance and  usually take between 14 and 18.5 grams, but 14 gets me good if a strain is strong, but 14 of the elephant wasn't strong till I took 18.5, then it felt good.


Like the other day even going to 16 grams on Green Malay was bad and made me overly sedated and not very pleasant feeling and I should have stuck with 14 or 15, but that much elephant wouldn't have even felt like enough.


Bentuangie wasn't incredible, Hulu Kapuas ok, but the best of these strains so far was the Green Vein Riau.


I always like Green Veins.

Stem and vein is exactly what it says, it's stems and veins. They're normally removed since they contain less mytragynine.

I kind of disagree. If kratom works well for him with anxiety, depression etc. then I don't see reason to stay away. If he can stay at a lower gram set dose say 5 grams or less then a couple few kilos could last him  few years. You just have to weigh the risk vs reward. If you knew for certain that it was being banned then that's one thing but to live under the constant fear and worry that it might be one  day be illegal then they have already won. Kratom has been on their radar for years and we all knew that it was a possibility  would be banned someday. 


I can't recall if you are still using kratom at all since the ban was first announced but if you aren't  what if they don't announce the future of kratom for another 3 months? That could of been 6 months that you could of been enjoying a legal plant that I know you love. Fuck the DEA, don't let them control your life out of fear of the "what if". I currently have a 10-20 gram daily habit and if they announce at the end of the month that they are banning it then I'll cross that bridge when it happens, hopefully they'll give more than a months notice this time but if they don't it's not the end of the world.

I TOTALLY recommend green Bali. I've only been using Kratom for about 6 months but it is hands down my favorite strain so far. I just tried it for the first time last week. It will be what I buy every time if it's available.

Oh yeah of course he could stock up.


I don't know why, I guess because I was just thinking of my own habits, because I don't like stocking up or being in possession of more than about 24 ounces at a time tops, I was imagining he wasn't going to stock up and just be buying little bits at a time, and thinking then if you'd never done Kratom before getting into it shortly before it being banned and just trying small amounts to see if you like it would be pointless.


But of course if he was going to stock up it could be worth it.


Yeah, before I had said I wasn't going to order more but then I kind of gave in and went the opposite route where I decided I still wanted to do some for a little while, so I decided that if it's going to become illegal I'm going to go out with a bang and try to try as many of the rarer strains I've never tried before as possible because I might never get another chance.


That's why I ordered all those like Elephant, Bentuangie, Stem and Vein, Green and Red Vein Riau, Hulu Kapuas, Pleasant Green Bali, etc.


So, do you think it MIGHT be a good sign that as of December 5th now the DEA hasn't made any announcement when they said they were going to on December 1st??


To me it seems like it might possibly be a good sign that perhaps they are involved in a bigger battle with the protesters than they anticipated and not sure yet what they are going to do.


I mean if they were 100% SURE they were going to make it illegal don't you think they would have promptly announced they were banning it right away on December 1st??


I think they probably would have so I'm thinking and hoping that maybe things aren't going quite as they'd planned that they haven't made the announcement yet.

But there is still some WD symptoms that are still not covered by kratom, it doesn't fully substitute for opiates.  That's how I feel. I have taken many grams today - an nearly unpalatable number of grams - and it does not seem to fully substitute for morphine-like drugs.

I'll put it to you like this. I have an oxy addiction of 100mg a day or so. I can switch from oxy to kratom without ANY physical withdrawals and yes the kratom gets me high too. It doesn't help with the oxy cravings though. I almost wish I never found kratom because I feel like I may have quit the oxy by now if I hadn't. Let's be honest, nobody here wants to quit their doc because they don't like the high. If you are like me it's the withdrawal that motivates you to quit. Because of kratom I can live very comfortably until I get my next script so why quit?


Also, I would like to add that when I started taking kratom my habit was about 60mg a day. DO NOT underestimate the potency of kratom.

So I don't know about you guys, but my unfortunate theory is that the DEA is just waiting for Trump to get in office and probably have Jeff Sessions the HUGE asshole who thinks weed is only for "bad people" to get into that Attorney General spot to announce that Kratom is illegal.


At first I was thinking it was a good sign that December 1st has passed without them saying anything, like maybe it was going to be more trouble than it was worth so they are reconsidering, but naw, I think they are just wait for Trump to take office to ban it.


People like Trump, Sessions and all these other assholes would love nothing more than to take another plant away from people.


What do you guys think?

I've had my doubts, as most of have had, every since they originally delayed the ban. The moment Trump was elected I got even more worried... Not just for kratoms future but marijuanas as well. I live in California so I was pleased with how the marijuana thing worked out but still worried for what the future holds since we know Trump's stand on it.


Your prediction could very well come true. Let's hope it doesn't.

Maybe you're a rare case - I could eat dozens of grams of powder kratom and it wouldn't touch heroin intranasal WD, clonidine is more efficacious. And this is at a relatively lower dose roughly equal to 75mg-160mg of morphine/ day or about 45-80mg per day equivalant of oxy ir maybe. But it's really pure like ~75% diacetylmorph #4

Yeah, I definitely do NOT want to be right about it.


I'm also worried about weed just as it was seeming like a sure thing to be on it's way to eventual legalization.


I think it PROBABLY still is.


Even though Sessions wants to stop it, I'm not sure if overall he can.


From what little I understand, he could still send the feds out to Cali, Colorado and the legal states to enforce the federal law, but then it becomes a federal vs state rights issue and would probably go to the supreme court, and I'm really thinking/hoping that he can't actually reverse the laws passed out there.


But he could really fuck shit up maybe for the states that are trying to legalize but haven't yet.


I mean seriously, the guy is like a fucking dinosaur: it's fucking about to be 2017 and this guy thinks "good people don't smoke marijuanna"!!


HELLO.


We aren't in the middle of Reagan's 80s Drug War propaganda anymore.


It's not the 1930s with Reefer Madness.


Just when you think these types of people are gone, they come out from under their rocks with their bibles with their hateful, racist, anti-drug rhetoric.

There ain't no stoppin reefer at this point. Trump got in on the potvote ( my potvote atleast) and He is a populist and marijuana is more popular than anyone in Washington - He doesn't won't a "hot" civil drug-war he wants states to do what they want and make money.


(side note: leaked 250,00 dollar speeches by hillary clinton has her saying "I am against MJ legalization in all it's forms.") now away from politics. We are doin allright. As long as that wall doesn't elevate the cost of my narcotics, presumably, largely coming from tunnels.

I'm reassured that we have lobbyists and people with money on our side in the kratom fight.  The American Kratom Association, The Botanical Education Alliance & all the politicians on BOTH sides of the aisle who have come out in support of kratom make this situation different than any other emergency scheduling situation in the past.  Of course we should be vigilant and expect the worst, but at least there's SOME hope to cling to.  


I still suggest stocking your storage room from the window to the wall with kratom just to be safe.  %)

I've been without internet so I haven't kept up on the current status of kratom. I'm really not all that surprised that we haven't heard anything yet and we might not until after Trump takes control.

Like most strains I couldn’t really tell the difference between Kapuas and many others.  I still can’t tell the difference between most of these strains, I just enjoy them all LOL.


I REALLY hope it doesn’t become illegal, but I’m still fearing the worst.


With Trump as president and the people he’ll appoint all kinds of horrible things are going to happen, and Kratom most likely (*fingers crossed*) becoming illegal isn’t even going to remotely scratch the surface…

It's against the rules to suggest that people to stock up on a legal substance if no sources are given?   Must've missed that rule somewhere.  Duly noted.  Sorry.  


Just a warning to anyone with IBS, hiatal hernia, ulcers or other GI problems:  eating lots of kratom powder can cause severe irritation of the entire GI tract.  I'm dealing with it right now, and it sucks.  I ate a little extra powder in my tea since I was coming off oxys and paid for it almost instantly.  It's now 24 hours later and I'm still miserable.  Gas, nausea, heartburn/reflux, pain...just awful.  


This is probably old news to some of ya's but I hadn't really experienced it firsthand until now.  Going to have to endure withdrawals now because there's no way I can choke down any form of kratom for at least another day.  I tried some strained tea and it just aggravated it.  Blah.

Lady c, could it be possible that the reason you are experiencing that is because of withdrawals from the oxy rather then an effect from the kratom?

Trump himself won’t, but Jeff Sessions might if he appoints him to attorney general, and while he himself wouldn’t know what kratom was, all that would have to happen would be for the DEA to tell him it’s a an opioid and slip  a notice past his desk for him to sign to make it illegal and I’m sure he’d do it if it was within his power.


He wants weed illegal and thinks only criminals use it so he’ll want every drug to be illegal.

It could be but I've experienced similar symptoms every now and then,  I usually do a cycle or two  of omeprazole and it goes away.

You shouldn't have WD using only 1 per day, beause the levels are only strong in your system for a couple of hours, you should not experience any noticeble WDs at all besides maybe a slight foggyness for a very short time (hours).

I read that the bioavailabilty of Mytraginine was only ~7% (in rats) which would explain why Kratom is more constampating than  other opiod but not as centrally-active.

I don't think one day is enough of a wash out to avoid becoming dependent 


when i do kratom i definitely still notice effects even 24 hours after i still feel energy and uplifted mood. 


I definitely know something is coming because I am never able to sleep now unless i take kratom at night.   hopefully thats as bad as I experience

So...I just took Kratom 4 days in a row for the first time ever and will be abstaining for at least 5-6 days and I'm sure the withdrawal won't be fun but I doubt it will be anything hellish either.


Prior to this month I'd never even taken it more than 2 days in a row.


How bad can I expect the WD to be??


I mean I always make sure to take at least a couple days off each week to keep myself from becoming too physically dependent, but I told myself I'd never use it more than 2 days in a row, and as of this month I fucked up twice taking it 3 days in a row and this is the first time I've ever taken it 4 in a row.


I mean am I correct in thinking that my WD going 4 days in a row won't be as bad as say, someone who's taken it 2 full weeks in a row without a break??


10 days ago I went 2 days in a row without taking it so i figure that gave me a mostly clean slate up till that point, but since then it's been on and off till 4 in a row this week starting Wednesday, and I took a SHITLOAD today, almost 2 ounces.


I'm anticipating some pretty heavy lethargy and depression, as that's what I get when I'm in WD, but I have NOTHING to do for the rest of the week so there's no reason I can't just sleep as much as i want.


I just hope I don't get insomnia.


I'd prefer to just sleep for like 4 days straight till its over lol.


The worst WD I've had only lasted 4 days before, after dosing 3 days in a row and finishing with some extract the last day.


That time I had some strong WD for 3 days, then very mild symptoms for a 4th and it was over by day 5 so I"m guessing it might just be a little worse than that time.


I mean Kratom WD can't really last much longer than 4 or 5 days can it???

It's impossible to say how bad it'll be for you. Have you been through opiate withdrawal before? You may experience some withdrawals, especially if you've been physically dependent on opiates before (kindling effect and all).


If I was CTing from your dosage regiment I would experience withdrawals. They wouldn't be severe but they wouldn't be un-noticeable either. I doubt your in for hell but you may be uncomfortable for a few days.


Again, everyone and every experience is different.

And also, will Klonopin and/or Phenibut help with the WDs??


I take Klonopin most days and have plenty of that and also have Phenibut, but since I took the latter today and never take it more than 2 days a week I wouldn't want to overdo that.

Emerald Thai Kratom

Does anyone have experience with this strain?  I used to think Kratom was Kratom but I was wrong.  Different strains very much have different effects.  I don't know what all the hullabaloo about maeng da is?  Emerald is waaay better IMO.  Much more sedating & lasts longer.  10-15gr is plenty for me.

I think they should legalize marijuana but prohibit alcohol.  At least weed has a legit medical reason for existence.  Booze has none & destroys lives.  Weed hurts no one except the weight loss industry. Munchies!!!! ![:-)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

A very quick taper may help but don't drag it out cause then, like you said, you'd probably be doing just as much harm as good by dosing more days in a row. You might be better off just stopping too. 


Sounds like you kinda already are tapering since you replied again and said you took 1 gram. It's a small dose and I hope it helped with the anxiety and RLS?


I've even found doses as small as 500mg to 750mg can help take the edge off... Of course assuming one doesn't have a monster of a tolerance at the time (which it sounds like you don't if 1 gram helped). One downside to such small doses is that, for me, they tend to only offer relief for like an hour or two. But sometimes that is all you need to help get to sleep.

Naw, IMO ALL drugs should be legal.


Just look at how alcohol prohibition went back in the 1930s.


BUT…if only one could be legal of course weed is safer.

Well, 24 hours after my last dose and I’m just a little tired.


Kratom WD is really really benign unless you use it like WEEKS in a row and even then probably not bad.


Kratom is such a safe drug IMO.   


It needs to stay legal, but unfortunately it won’t.


The way our government works most of the most dangerous drugs stay legal and the safe ones become schedule one.


Alcohol and cigs are legal, prescription pain killers legal for medicinal use.


But weed and shrooms are illegal.


If something is benign and makes you feel pleasant and enjoy your day, it’s going to be jumped on by the government.


If it is capable of killing you or causing serious addiction, whether or not it becomes illegal is based on the ability of the government to profit off of it.


Heroin isn't illegal cause it's dangerous, it's illegal cause of the history of gangs profiting off it, because it keeps the prison industry going, and because big pharma would have to patent it and sell it to make a profit and that would look more suspicious than them doing what they are doing selling Oxy, Vicodin, etc, all drugs which are basically the same thing.


Just like Meth being illegal and Adderall legal:  the government just makes their own socially acceptable versions to sell.


Maybe we'll get the same with Kratom if they patent that...one can only hope...

I still am not sure how much of a difference there is in strains.


BUT…yesterday I mixed  a shitload of strains such as Elephant, Red Vien Riau, Red Malay, Benguangie, Green Vein Riau, etc…..and the effect was closer to an opiate high than I usually get.


However, for me I really prefer my Kratom highs to have an energetic quality to them: so in order to get it I drank some energy drinks and used my “daylight” which stimulates sunlight and kind of wakes you up, and that gave me what I was looking for.


It might be cause I have ADD and some other “shit” lol, but I get interesting reactions to some drugs.


Like, do you guys get this effect I get from a good stimulating Kratom strain:  you get super enthusiastic in thinking about all kinds of ideas, just random shit, daydreaming, and for me I have always been REALLY into making “lists” my whole life.


I always enjoyed it.


So on a good stimulant, whether  it’s Kratom or Dexadrine or Prolintane, hell, it would even happen on Oxycodone or Hydrocodone which is interesting, I know I’m having a good time if I start making  “lists” of shit lol.


Even not actually writing them out, but maybe just in my head: thinking about the different drugs I have done in my life and counting them out hahaha, thinking about my favorite foods and listing them, favorite movies or bands, whatever is fun to think about.


So that is an effect I seek out in Kratom, and I usually get it.


It’s honestly my very favorite effect I get from Kratom and is good for both work and play and I can be very enthusiastic in academic work in this state and very creative mentally, but it doesn’t occur if my high is purely a sedadative one or as much  on red strains as green (I almost never use white though, not sure why).


Same for Oxy or Vicodin: low dose I get this effect less, but higher doses I get it, which is interesting cause most don’t think of opiates as “stimulants” but they stimulate my thoughts LIKE CRAZY, in a similar way to actual stimulants, but the bodily effect is of course the opposite.


And that is why KRatom is my favorite drug: combo of opioid and stimulant, best of both worlds.

I used to feel the same way. Did lots of stimulant drugs back in the day...cocaine, Dexedrine/Adderall, methamphetamine etc. 


You know, "the usual". LOL


But nowadays I just want something to enjoy w/ cannabis as I lay in bed and drift off to sleep. Like heroin, for example. But heroin isn't good for you so I'd ideally like to find some kind of alternative to enjoy.

Well, I don't use heroin, but weed and Kratom are such an amazing combo.


Over the summer I combined kratom, weed, caffeine and Phenibut for the first time and the euphoria was insane.


But I can't sleep on Kratom or usually even for hours after taking it it will keep me up.


It's one of the only really bad effects for me: it's like pure insomnia lol.


But not everyone reacts that way, especially not with the red strains.


I've only a couple times gotten truly sedated from Kratom: oddly the first time I ever used it and made a strong tea, which I haven't done since then and opted to toss n' wash as it's easier, but that one night I nodded off HARD.


I feel there is probably some "secret" to achieving that effect from Kratom if you want it, maybe beyond higher doses and red strains, seeing as the tea for some odd reason did that but toss n' wash rarely has.


Then again, that was like the first time I EVER used it, so it's maybe not odd it sedated me more then.


But if falling asleep is what you want, low dose Vic or Oxy plus weed is more likely...despite it being so much worse for you IMO than Kratom.

You would also be FAR more likely to sleep on a Kratom extract + weed.


That's the only time I've never had trouble sleeping on Kratom is with the extracts as they are different and more like pure Oxy or Vicodin in experience I feel, but also much more addictive than plain leaf.


But that sounds like the experience you are looking for: like UEI and some weed.

I wonder how much an individual's unique physiological makeup determines what kind of effect kratom delivers?  Probably alot.  The day I found Kratom was a damned good day.  Weed makes me tense & paranoid.  I'm not stupid enough to fuck with coke, booze or H.  Synthetic opioids are crap.  Kratom is perfect IMO.  The nausea is the only negative I've found.  Which is easily fixed by consuming something with a high fat content.  The fat probably acts as an emulsafier?

Got some white vein Maeng Da from my usual vendor, I was looking for a little boost at work. However this is the most sedated I've ever been from kratom. I can take Bali all day and not get tired. although I never get above 10g doses. But this white vein Maeng Da like 2 teaspoons and I'm out. The green Maeng Da this dude sells gives me hella motivation, any reason why the white vein would be so different?

White vein huh?  I might give that a shot next.  Being a live wire Type A person I don't need any stimulation.  Kratom's sedative effects are heaven to me.  It slows things down so I can contemplate reflect & enjoy.

Personally, I think a good source makes a much bigger difference than strain.


Everyone has their own favorite strains. Best bet is to try different strains until you find one you like. I've experienced some significant variability in getting the same strains from different places. I think Google searches are your best friend for figuring out people's experiences with certain products since sourcing is strictly against BL rules.

For those of you who have experienced WD, does it usually take about 24 hours to notice anything and then it's over in about 72 hours? It seems to take a full day without dosing before I notice any discomfort but it's the fastest WD to be over I've ever experienced. Just wondering if it's this way for others.

For me, although WD is minor, when I get it it is usually worst the 2nd  day, then less bad the 3rd but worse on the 3rd than the first, and over by the 4th or 5th, but it can only last that long when I take a REAL lot.


The same thing happens for caffeine withdrawal for me, except that for me Caffeine WD is ENDLESS so I gave up trying (last time I was STILL in WD on day ELEVEN!!)….but in both cases I chalk up WD being milder the 1st day due to my MASSIVE consumption of both leaving me still having some alkaloids/drug left in my system for the first 24 hours, but by the second day it’s all gone and I’m feeling it.


Like today was day 2 after a pretty hard 4 day Kratom binge, and I don’t have work for the next couple weeks so I just fucking slept all day hahahah.


Other than feeling pretty tired, it’s fine.


I’ve gotten depressed in the past at times, runny nose, this time I just wanted to sleep, but now that I’m up I’m totally fine at a little over 48 hours since my last dose.


I will go another 2-4 days to REALLY wash out before my next dose so I have a clean slate as I just do not like being physically dependent….oh, and I haven’t been able to shit for 2 days lol…so I will need a laxative tonight….usually Metamucil is enough, but when it isn’t I go for Dulcolax.


Otherwise, it ends FOR ME within 3-4 days, but what I’ve found with things like caffeine, is that the longer and more I use the longer and worse WD is.


That may not go for Kratom, but I can’t understand why with Caffeine withdrawal I used to be over the WD in 3 days, and the last time on day 11 I was still in it, and every time I tried to quit the WD would last longer and longer…


What I'd say is that caffeine WD and Kratom WD are nearly identical for me, EXCEPT that caffeine WD lasts like 3 times as long so it's WAY worse.


I'm not dependent on Kratom, but quitting caffeine is a bitch.


They are related in some ways and have some similar alkaloids, so the similarities make sense, and yet the worse of the 2 isn't even considered a drug, and the other the DEA wants to be schedule one so go figure...

Yeah I'm not concerned about the addictive potential of kratom at all...to me it's about as addictive as the coffee I drink every morning. I've done it for months at a time and have never gotten any real noticeable WD symptoms from it. 


I agree that it's something of a "wonder drug"...I had a quarter pound of Maeng Da from a vendor I really like (although it's pricier than other options) over the summer and that stuff was insane. It gave me unlimited energy combined with making physical movement feel *really good*, in the manner of a true opiate. My job is fairly physically demanding so that was an awesome feature I thought. Loved that stuff!

> Abstract
> 
> INTRODUCTION:
> 
> 
> 
> Mitragynine is a major bioactive compound of Kratom, which is derived from the leave extracts of Mitragyna speciosa Korth or Mitragyna speciosa (M. speciosa), a medicinal plant from South East Asia used legally in many countries as stimulant with opioid-like effects for the treatment of chronic pain and opioid-withdrawal symptoms. Fatal incidents with Mitragynine have been associated with cardiac arrest. In this study, we determined the cardiotoxicity of Mitragynine and other chemical constituents isolated using human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs).
> 
> METHODS AND RESULTS:
> 
> 
> 
> The rapid delayed rectifier potassium current (IKr), L-type Ca2+ current (ICa,L) and action potential duration (APD) were measured by whole cell patch-clamp. The expression of KCNH2 and cytotoxicity was determined by real-time PCR and Caspase activity measurements. After significant IKr suppression by Mitragynine (10 µM) was confirmed in hERG-HEK cells, we systematically examined the effects of Mitragynine and other chemical constituents in hiPSC-CMs. Mitragynine, Paynantheine, Speciogynine and Speciociliatine, dosage-dependently (0.1∼100 µM) suppressed IKr in hiPSC-CMs by 67%∼84% with IC50 ranged from 0.91 to 2.47 µM. Moreover, Mitragynine (10 µM) significantly prolonged APD at 50 and 90% repolarization (APD50 and APD90) (439.0±11.6 vs. 585.2±45.5 ms and 536.0±22.6 vs. 705.9±46.1 ms, respectively) and induced arrhythmia, without altering the L-type Ca2+ current. Neither the expression, and intracellular distribution of KCNH2/Kv11.1, nor the Caspase 3 activity were significantly affected by Mitragynine.

I know tea kills the potency but one time I made tea with about 50 g.    I drank the first extracts all at once and It was like a very clean dilaudid + amphetamine high with zero nausea that hit within ten minutes.


...there is a reason this shit is being made illegal.   If you know how to get off on it its as good as hard drugs...unless you have a high tolerence from being a regular user of strong opiate drugs

I’m like you, I take about 14-18 grams.


I’m not so sure though about how much that matters though, because if your tolerance is high like ours to the point where 16 grams for me feels like what 7 feels like for someone else, are we really fucking ourselves up that much worse in terms of WD or our bodies overall?


I mean it’s a high dose because we let our tolerances get that high, but our bodies still register it in terms of effect as the same as a  smaller dose, and since it doesn’t cause respiratory depression IMO, it’s not like if someone takes a really high dosage of Oxycodone or drinks a liter of Vodka, it’s probably all the same to our bodies in the end.


I should never have let mine get this high and been strict with dosing.


I have never done heroin, but I have a pretty hard time believing that for MOST people ANY amount of PLAIN leaf Kratom could feel as strong as a decent dose of Heroin, especially IV'd.


I'll never touch H, but I am pretty sure if I did shoot some right now it would feel way stronger than 20 grams of plain leaf for me.

Idiots spouting off dumb shit like "Kratom is heroin" is why the DEA is on Kratom now.  I never down more 10gr straight leaf at once & that puts me on EZ street for hours.  This shit is fucking perfect.  I can see why the Thai government made K illegal in 1942...it's a huge threat to their opium trade.

This isn't being made illegal yet. We don't know for sure what the DEA will be able to do. And no, it is not as strong as heroin. It isn't even a full agonist.

Kratom is a very safe substance.  If there are actually any deaths which could be attributed to it the ratio is so ridiculous it's laughable compared to oxy/hydro.  Even then there is no known mytragynine  toxicity levels.  The FDA/ DEA has no (0) medically creditable clinical studies to base they're "kratom is herbal heroin" BS on.  NONE!!!

Kratom is used to help wean hardcore heroin addicts off H.  This fact speaks volumes as to the power of K.

I didn't say it was heroin, i said it felt like heroin.  I was nodding out hard core.  ARe you telling me that I was not?  Maybe that was a bit of an exaggeration...but it was as good as a medium dose of heroin.     


This was with zero tolerance....obviously once you use kratom everyday for like a week you can't get off on it they way you can keep getting off on heroin.  


Lying to yourself is not going to fool the DEA, they have doctors and scientists working for them and I wouldn't be surprised if they have actual addicts working for them as well.   They are well aware that you can get fucked up off this drug.


Granted it has a ceiling you hit where you can't contintue to get wrecked until you die like with heroin, but saying that its not a real drug you are lying to yourself....why the hell do you think you like it so much if its not good  recreational drug?


I think it should stay legal because its not dangerous...just annoying that you can get dependent on it.  But its better than ppl jabbing themselves with needles shooting processed tar and elephantanyl into their bodies and supporting cartels which flood the US with meth coke and more heroin.. which is what everyone will be doing after it becomes illegal.

Kratom is a god send in my life. I can attest to the fact that it IS pretty powerful but I also have not seen any negative side effects from it. Just about everything produced for consumption in the US is addictive it seems like so I can't see banning it on that basis. If that's the case we need to ban McDonald's, soda, coffee, omg redbull and monster, cigarettes and dip..... the list could go on for hours. Kratom helps me more than anyone will know and it would suck to see it go.

^agree to that, the DEA couldn't ban it just for causing dependency...so they had to make up a lie that its dangerous which is apparently being challenged pretty harshly by opponents to the dea.


granted they just outlawed CBD which is not dangerous nor intoxicating in any respect whatsoever....so logic and reality has no bearing on what they are able to do unfortunately

Kratom will definitely constipate you. Maybe not at your dose but at over an ounce a day it will clog you right on up along with turning your BM green. Hope that's not tmi.

Scourge I'm with you that kratom isn't intoxicating like heroin, you can do anything you want on it.  


if you have never used it and have zero opioid tolerance and you drop 20g like i did one time ....i was fucked and couldn't stop nodding.

Despite a small amount of nausea I'm great.  I'm not so f'ed up I'm incapacitated & I don't think K would do that regardless of how much I used.  There is no legitimate reason to make K illegal.  NONE.  The fact alcohol is not only legal but glamorized clearly demonstrates what a total joke the DEA truly is.  Alcohol serves no (0) medical purpose whatsoever & kills thousands of people every goddam day but because it's supported by a multi-million dollar lobbying organization it's legal.  Typical drug war idiocy!!!

Interesting comparison. Things would be much different if the question was 'is x drug worse than alcohol, tobacco, and caffeine' instead of 'is x drug potentially abusable and does it have a medicinal benefit'


In the former case, kratom would definitely be legal, but unfortunately, the latter is a big yes in both cases. Worse yet, the DEA only recognizes FDA approval for a health disorder as a "medicinal benefit"


But I have hopes that things can change!

I wouldn't worry about it unless you have preexisting heart issues. I actually have some minor cardiovascular problems and had everything checked out and nothing has gotten worse or better since I started using kratom.


Some paper speculated that it could lengthen QT interval, but its not a medical fact. It's definitely something to avoid if you already have long QT syndrome though.

The only problem K has ever given me is turbo-charged vomiting.  It's kind of a catch 22 issue.  The emptier your stomach is the quicker & stronger effect K is going to have.  But the emptier your stomach is the the easier irritated the stomach lining, is.  


The nausea only lasts 15-20mins.  Then the full EZ street effect of K is reached which lasts about 4hrs.  I don't understand why idiots screw with H when you can legally get K?  Once the right people start experimenting & eventually raise the alkaloid concentration to 20% I think you'll see a major reduction in H & Oxy use.  Which will be a huge benefit to society.


If the idiot DEA is successful in scheduling K this ^ will never happen.

The biggest problem and hinderence with kratom is that it is unpalatable to consume enough to cover WDs considering it takes 12+ grams every 2 hours to cover "mild" heroin WDs. That being said, This plant ought to be commericial and specially cultivated to raise potency like marijuana has been - at 20% alkaloid content vs 1-6%, I could get something from it.


Kratom for WD is literally doing the cinnamon challenge every 2 hrs and I have chosen WD many times over coughing down 10 grams of sawdust.

you're doing it wrong.  make 1 gram bombs in a single ply of toilet paper and swallow.  no dust, no nausea.   The one time I drank the dust without bombing in toilet paper was when i vomited.  never got sick otherwise.   Tea also eliminates nausesa aspect very well also but kills potency

FYI kratom will easily mix into hot water. So if you put it in hot water or tea or whatever, it'll mix right it. Then you can shoot it. You still have to deal with the taste, but it's not any worse than shooting alcohol IMO. Just need a chaser

the toilet paper thing sucks...although i usually put more like 1.5-2 grams in each toilet paper bomb....u have to know how to tie them up and cut off excess tag ends really well then wash it down all at once with a huge gulp....and yet i usually have to do it 4-7 times to get enough down. but it hits faster than gel caps....caps are easier to swallow but i just always forget to buy

That being said, This plant ought to be commericial and specially cultivated to raise potency like marijuana has been - at 20% alkaloid content vs 1-6%, I could get something from it.

If you really find t&w too unpleasant then you should really try capsules. Some vendors fill them themselves but you can just buy a bunch of the big ones and do it yourself.

 Health stores usually sell empty ones for cheap. You can fill almost a gram per capsule (look for the BIG ones) so taking 12 at a time is doable, you could also make 2-3 holes per capsule with a pin and they'll disolve quicker.


It feels almost the same as toss and wash IMO and the effects seem to last a bit longer, so just what you're looking for.


Also make sure that your kratom is good quality, the strain isn't even that important. Read plenty of reviews and find the best vendor (this goes for anyone who's just getting into kratom as well)

Kratom does make me a little bit nauseated, but never anything that some pepto bismol and a little bit of time won't take care of.


I mean I take LARGE doses and Pepto will clear it up for me.


Today I ate 2--18.5mg doses, seperated by 5 hours as Kratom lasts 4 hours for me, and the only reason I got more nauseated than normal is cause I had a GIGANTIC Christmas dinner along with it full of potatos, stuffing, yams, cranberry sauce and turkey.


I even did an hour and a half of hard exercise, physical therapy for my legs and neck, while on my second dose.


I will admit, today the nausea was quite strong and there were a couple times while exercising that I had to stop and rest because I thought I might puke if I didn't, so i rested and was fine and the nausea went away once I finished exercising.


Back that was really all cause I ate so much food.


When I don't eat like that on Kratom I just get a little nausea and take Pepto and it's gone in 20-30 minutes.


I have never once puked after taking Kratom, which is nice because I can only imagine it would feel REALLY disgusting to puke that powder up.


But then again, I have a really strong stomach when it comes to handling things.


I very rarely puke even on very large amounts of alcohol, though part of that is my huge alcohol tolerance, and very rarely feel nauseated from lots of foods that may bother other people.


Though I have become more prone to nausea in the past several years when eating, still, pepto and/or gas X clears that up.


And for those concerned about the heart study they said this:


"Our study indicates that Mitragynine and its analogues may **potentiate** Torsade de Pointes through inhibition of IKr in human cardiomyocytes."


Note the bold: you can't potentiate something you don't have, so the study obviously indicates that if you have Torase de Pointes Kratom can make it worse.


If you don't, I don't see how that article indicates it can cause it, so it probably can't, or at least they don't seem to have shown clear proof that it can.

Hey everyone, 

This is my first post here, I've been a lurker for years but never felt the need to post until now. 

 I've been taking kratom daily for several years, usually about 10-12 g, 3x a day. 

I used to have an H habit about 20 years ago but now it's just kratom, weed and the occasional psychedelic/empathogen to keep my mind limber and flexible ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) 

Anyway I recently received a couple of kilos of some new "super fresh and potent"  "kratom" from my supplier, (not a major, well known one, but one I've had for a long time) they're labeled Bali and Maeng Da, and they're affecting me in a very unusual way. 

Instead of the warm, stimulating opiate feeling I usually get from kratom this stuff gives me strong sedation, blurred vision, intense eye wiggles, serious vertigo/dizziness, sometimes a headache, and it only partially relieves WD symptoms. It looks more yellow-green than usual, it tastes different, and it feels like it's somehow related to kratom, but different. I've written my supplier to let him know but have not heard back from him.

My neighbor had to call in sick to work after taking only 10 grams of this stuff because he couldn't see well enough to drive safely, and he's a daily user as well. 

 My question is this: Has anyone else encountered kratom like this before? If I wanted to get it tested for RC's, o-desmethyltramadol etc. could anyone tell me where on the west coast US I could send it for testing?

 I know kratom very very well and this stuff feels really wrong. My guy supposedly gets it very fresh straight from Indonesia so it seems unlikely to be adulterated with RC's, but anything is possible I guess. Perhaps it's another plant? I actually suspected Datura at first (I've personally seen it growing all over Indonesia) but this "kratom" doesn't cause dry mouth so it seems unlikely. 

Thank the gods my friend had an extra kilo of old stock Bali sitting around to loan me until I get some better shit, cuz this new stuff feels like poison. 


Thanks in advance

Questions about identifying drugs and sourcing are against the rules. I would really advise against using any of this "kratom" you're talking about. You're going to have to bite the bullet and get a different product.

Wow hey sorry I didn't think I was saying anything specific about my source, and I thought I could ask about testing labs especially given that kratom is fully legal. As a site that is supposedly focused on harm reduction I figured it was cool. My bad if I broke the rules, I'll try to be more careful in my wording in the future I guess.

K' s effect can vary on the same person using the same dosage of the same strain.  But your experience is one helluva variance.

yeah for sure, my friends and neighbors have all had the same experience. If I manage to get it tested I'll post the results, but my gut feeling is that there's either something else going on here or something about the way it was processed or dried has changed the alkaloid content. It is a lot more yellow than usual which could indicate that the leaves were already dead when they were dried. I first encountered this plant and started chewing fresh kratom leaves in Southern Thailand about 15 years ago, and my friends there always said that leaves that were dead on the tree were no good, so maybe that's what's up with this stuff. Maybe.

Don't sweat it--your fine. I think it used to be allowed to provide sources for hr related things, but sourcing of any kind is against the rules now.  I also thought it was kind of silly at first for HR or legal things, but it makes a lot of sense. Even with the strict, no-sourcing policy, people have published papers in which BL is referred to as an online forum for sourcing drugs. Ridiculous. 


Anyways, I think most people here can appreciate that youre trying to be conscious of the rules, because it's not uncommon for people to post things that are blatantly against the rules and repost even after their threads are closed by moderators. But it would be a good idea to read through the forum guidelines

Created an account so I could just warn people I had a horrible grand mal seizure from kratom (and etizolam withdrawal). Don't take this shit for benzo withdrawal. I woke up with paramedics surrounding me, bleeding horribly from my head. If I was in a car or walking down the stairs, I'd be fucked. I told my story on Reddit and got a ton of people messaging me about having the exact same thing happen. 15 or so minutes always after taking kratom during eti withdrawal. Of course people called me a liar and blamed other stuff. There's even another post there from a year or so back of the exact same thing . I've got logs of talking to people who had it happen. It's not a coincidence.   I've never had to go to the hospital for anything. I've used kratom since 2001 and never had this happen. But sometimes with the brain zaps after taking  too much in a day I felt like I was on the verge, and the weird anxiety. I've quit eti before, and other benzos without any sign of seizure, but after that kratom kicked in it was lights out. I know it' taboo to claim kratom can be negative in any way, but I just wanted to warn people to be careful. I still use kratom, but NEVER during withdrawals. I think there's a lot we don't know about it. I've also talked to numerous people who also developed tinnitus and panic attacks, like I have, from use. I have aways felt kratom lowers the seizure threshold and mixed with a a thienotriazolodiazepine was not a good combination.

This is something that I've seen reported several times. Even with your personal account, it's hard to pinpoint the exact cause. I think it's prudent for seizure prone individuals to avoid kratom, but we still can't rule out the possibility that it's related to specific strain varieties, processing methods, or contiminants in the leaf. I've personally gotten very different effects from powdered lead that I've purchased from different vendors, so I wonder if there is an alkaloid(s) that is left behind in some products via different processing techniques. 


Unfortunately, this wild speculation is a direct result of our very poor regulation of herbs and supplements.

This is basically the same question I have, is it possible that the alkaloid content could change noticeably depending on the age of the tree, the freshness of the leaves before drying, exposure to sunlight etc... ?  My kratom-chewing friends in Thailand always said the leaves were only good when they were fresh and most of them wouldn't even use them if they had dried out. I always assumed it was because chewing dried leaves just sucks, and having personally chewed a ton of fresh kratom leaves I can say with certainty that the effect is basically the same whether the leaves are chewed fresh or dried into a powder and swallowed.

Besides vomiting muscle twitches is the only side I've ever had.  I still keep thinking about kratom's evolution following the same pattern as MJ.   20 freakin percent alkaloids would drop anyone like a bad habit.  Three days in dream land.

You mean it's coarser then usual? If so: it just wasn't ground as finely as you are used to.


I recently received some coarser kratom from a place I usually get finely ground powder from. The coarse stuff was a more expensive Maeng Da strain. It worked for me just as well as any other strain. Wasn't worth the extra money, in my opinion, but that's just the way things go.


I suspect it absorbs in the stomach slightly slower since it isn't ground as finely but honestly I haven't been able to tell the difference when using it versus the other stuff.


One thing I noticed about the coarser stuff I have: one tablespoon of it weighs slightly more than a tablespoon of the finely ground stuff. This may not be universal... Just something I noticed about the batch I have.

If it's actually kratom that you have, then yes it is safe.


Of course there is always a chance what you have is not actually kratom... If that is the case then there is no way any of could tell you whether it's safe or not.


Try contacting the vendor and ask them about it. If they are a reputable vendor I'm sure they would be happy to explain why it looks different than usual in texture. Just be polite when asking.


I bet it's regular kratom that hasn't been ground super fine... But there is no way for me to know whether or not that actually is the case through the internet. Sorry man.

(sorry for the double post - using mobile and cannot edit)


I just checked my Maeng Da (the stuff I said that I had that is more coarse) and it does kinda look like green sand. My stuff works great, hopefully that is the case with yours as well.

Alot of people dose high expecting an effect that simply isn't possible with K & keep increasing they're doses in an ignorant attempt towards that end.  


The DEA is either stupid unaware of K' s real effects(not likely) OR their lying about they're true reasons for scheduling it (very likely).

I take that much and more daily. You were most likely really high and just didn't notice it. I know that prolly doesn't make sense but that's the best I can explain it. Have you maybe forgotten what sober actually feels like? I know we all run fast and hard from sobriety but it doesn't hurt to skip the drugs for a few days at a time.

Mycophile regularly takes days off from kratom according to his posts.


Mycophile: I have zero explanation for why you felt sober after a second redose of 16g. Same thing happens to me sometimes. For example, yesterday I took 6g and enjoyed the effects. After about 2 hours I decided to take another 6 grams. When I kicked in, it felt like I went from being high from the first dose to being sober suddenly.


I can't explain other than to say I was probably still high but just wasn't able to distinguish the effects anymore. Why? No clue.

Yeah, gmlifer is not correct about me forgetting what high feels like cause I often go several days without dosing.


IMO if I don't FEEL high than I am NOT high...Period.


Kratom is a very unusual drug and I don't think it's impossible there could be some unusual mechanism where too much in your system somehow can equal no longer feeling high.


I mean in general my euphoria is not as strong as it had been before because my tolerance is getting so high, and that makes sense of course, but I generally think that that should just mean that dosing higher would equal just as good or strong a high, but that's not ALWAYS the case.


Right now I am on 15grams which is a normal dose for me, and while I AM high, I am nowhere near as euphoric as I often am.


But last weekend I was very high off of the same doses, so I don't believe that all that much could have changed in a  week as far as my tolerance or any misunderstood mechanisms going on in my body.


**Can anyone think of ANY other mind altering drug where taking TOO much can equal feeling sober again??**


There MUST be at least one we can think of.


As we all know, Kratom has 29 alkaloids and some of them probably work at cross purposes.


Like there are certain alkaloids I've heard which can calm you down in a direct attempt to temper the stimulant alkaloids so that you are less likely to have a seizure or have your heart rate go to a dangerous level.


And I generally seek out a stimulant high, so who knows, maybe I took so much that my body reacted to the Kratom by making use of the sedative alkaloids to temper and cancel out the stimulant effects so that I wouldn't be at a dangerous level of stimulation??  (Not that I believe it can get dangerous...just trying to make reason of this??)


I have heard people mention that many of the alkaloids work in opposition to eachother, kind of like who the L-Theanine in tea works to calm one from the stimulant effects of the tea  (As we know, Kratom is also related to both Green Tea and Coffee, but I am not sure if it actually has caffeine or L-Theanine in it, I don't think it does have caffeine).


But I am SURE there MUST be a substance out there that gets you high where if you take too much you no longer feel high.


Not sure what it could be, but I just have a strong feeling there's on out there, and if we can figure out what it is maybe we can figure out why this happens.


And even in those cases where I won't necessarily COMPLETELY stop getting high, there have been several times I've been high but those that another 2 grams might get me in a better place, and then after I took them it was TOO much and I started getting dysphoric and ruined my high...hence...probably a Kratom overdose.


I can only assume that that is basically what I did again...and I DID in fact start feeling dizzy and probably getting what most would call "the eye wobbles" before my high just ended.


The only difference is that in those other times where I just took 2 grams too many I started actually feeling BAD and overly sedated, but there were still SOME remnants of the good high left over.


In this case, first there was some strong dizziness, and then just NOTHING altogether, like I'd dosed myself COMPLETELY sober.


It was definitely a Kratom overdose for sure, but why it resulted in only dysphoria AT FIRST and then NOTHING for hours later...I can only guess.


One thing I DID notice though...is that once MOST of it had worn off except a few grams  (I kept re-dosing so at one point late at night MOST had worn off except like 5 grams) THEN for about 45 mins I WAS just a little bit high before it wore off.


This would perhaps point towards this idea that too high a dosage can cancel itself out, but that a lower dosage would have felt nice, and that maybe my high returned for a bit because some of the alkaloids wore off.


I am going to believe that for WHATEVER reason this is what occurred.


I'm going to post this on Reddit and see what those guys have to say about it.


Kratom is certainly a mysterious substance, and with so many alkaloids that work together in odd ways, I think it is possible that you could dose yourself sober.


Maybe the moral of the story is: SOMETIMES less is more.


At WORST you may get dysphoria and no longer be high if you take too much, or at best maybe this could happen again: dosing yourself sober.


Better to take a lower amount than you think you need and see how you feel and then take more.


But if anyone here can think of another drug where you can "dose yourself sober" I'd be interested in hearing about it so maybe we can compare the mechanisms and figure out how or why this could happen.

you're suspicions are probably along the right track as to why a ceiling effect exists or why u get this sobering up effect from higher doses.


kratom has a lot of different pharmacological targets in the brain (don't know them off the top of my head) and also a different mechanism of action (doesn't bind directly to opioid recepter but to a protein that is coupled to the opioid receptor).


There are so many possibilities as far as certain pharmacological activities of K only being active at higher doses or canceling others out or changing their character.  Its definitely possible.  never experienced it myself....if i took too much i either got super high or go nauseous.


can't think of any other drug that does this.


just to give un update on my mini withdrawal from K.   


I took it everydays for two weeks at 5-10 g per day.  Then I withdrew and felt jittery and unable to sleep for a few days and doing work was difficult but after about the 4th day I felt totally normall again.  So then at one week i decided to do K again.  took a dose one night then another dose the next morning.  then i took about the next 36 hours off and didn't feel a W/D coming .  now i just had another small dose.  hope i don't get addicted again.  its a fine line I'm walking.


wish i had the dosing disciopline that myco does.   I try to get my S/O to hide and only give me krat once a week....but shes to weak to argue with me and just lets me have some anytime i ask


btw myco, do you take amphetaminees? ;-) just joking but I have seen meth users on here write shorter and less descriptive posts than u usually do. its a good thing, you're obviously passionate about drugs and using them responsibly

Yea mycophile does tend to write long posts but he doesn't ramble on like a tweaker IMO. If I had to guess, I think his posts come across as very serious but from a place of anxiety and maybe of OCD.

When I first started taking kratom, I had the exact same issue with eating food. That effect seems to have worn off though. I think most people have the oppossite issue with kratom(eating too little), so I'm glad I'm not the only one!


As for the reverse tolerance, I think it's partly due to developing a dependence. For example, caffeine does very little to improve cognitive performance in non-tolerant individuals, but it does improve performance in tolerant individuals. Basically, caffeine doesn't do a whole lot, but if you're dependent on it, taking it will bring you out of a WD state so that your cognitive performance improveves. Something similar might be happening with kratom, but I could be wrong. 


My friends who don't have any mental or physical health issues don't really feel kratom, and they need a lot to notice anything. A couple of my friends who had depression or pain issues loved it at pretty low doses. I think people who have issues that kratom can treat will naturally be more sensitive to it, and if you're getting to the point of physical dependence, you might be naturally sensitizing yourself to it's effects.

Is that so? I thought caffeine did improve cognitive performance by  promoting wakefulness. In my experience once I get tolerant to caffeine, it stops making me feel awake.

Caffeine can help with sleep deprivation. If you're a healthy adult with healthy sleep habits, it won't do much.

I'm still hung up on the possibility of 20% Kratom as opposed to the 1.75% (at the most) of today's K.  5gr of 20% I think would drop the highest tolerance K-Head like a bullet to the brain.  That cat would be snoring for days!

**thinking of trying kramtom for pain**


I have recently started to look into kramtom for pain. However, saying i am confused would be the understatement of the century. I have read that red bali is the most opiod like. I have also read that the DEA report warns that commerically available kramtom can be laced with RCs. How does one  ensure that one's source is not contaminated? Or for that matter that the label on the bag is the right one ( as far as type)? Thanks

Does anyone know how much of the loss of potency of kratom when making tea is due to heat-destruction of mitragynines VS not extracting 100% of the material?


its a pretty drastic loss in potency at least the way i make tea (heating powder in water/lemon for about ten minutes) then filtering and rinsing the material multiple times with water filtrates.


If its due to heat-destruction of mitragyinine,  has anyone tried any no-heat methods....like just blending in lemon water or something then filtering? 


any other tips on increasing the "yield" of your tea?


i really prefer the high that tea gives, don't know why.  I actually like the taste too.

For example, caffeine does very little to improve cognitive performance in non-tolerant individuals, but it does improve performance in tolerant individuals. Basically, caffeine doesn't do a whole lot, but if you're dependent on it, taking it will bring you out of a WD state so that your cognitive performance improveves. Something similar might be happening with kratom, but I could be wrong.

A couple of my friends who had depression or pain issues loved it at pretty low doses.

Actually kratom has an opiate antagonist within that kind of regulates tolerance. I literally can use a 5g dose for months at a time with very similar effects, maybe the good parts begin to fade a bit but a higher dose usually actually just feels worse for me. I just begin to feel weird, not a stronger opiate high but rather just bad nausea and like a pressure headache and just pretty crappy. Which is what I love about kratom, it kind of regulates itself from being too abusable or building some rediculous tolerance like with real opiates where you have to constantly up your dose for the same effect.

I have the same effect with tolerance. I can use around 10g a day with little to no tolerance issues for pain management. I still take a short break or taper down every couple months for good measure anyways. 


I'm skeptical of the opioid antagonists being responsible for the ceiling effect. They would still be present in the same ratio regardless of how much is taken. I think the kappa opioid agonist activity of mytragynine is probably playing a bigger role in why kratom isnt as euphoric and why higher doses are sometimes less pleasant. Also, there are tons of alkaloids that haven't been extensively characterized. The best we can really do is speculate.

No not lately, and only rarely would I ever get Dexadrine though I use to get it sometimes, or for a little while Prolintane.


I do drink WAY too much coffee (I’d like to cut down) and that plus Kratom, sometimes Phenibut and my anxiety can make me a very stimulated person.


On the one hand it’s drugs, on another I have an anxiety disorder, but beyond that, I have just always written a lot.


Got a graduate degree in English and I’m long winded and love to write, so you put all that together and you get long rambling posts…it’s partially my style, partially just my personality, partially some drugs lol.

Thanks it's all good.


Yeah, as I said, I take a fair amount of stimulants but not actual amphetamines, but my mind is kind of like that of a tweaker's when you combine that with anxiety, or just plain rambling thought, and with my writing style it can come off as a lot.


Even at my best and most calm, like relatively so right now, I have an excited nature, I'm long winded and write a lot because I have a background in writing and English, and neurologically speaking I'm probably not an "NT" (neurotypical).


My mind functions differently IMO, and I like to write, so I end up rambling lol.

what are the chances that the DEA, when they do make their announcement that kratom is scheduled, will give zero warning (for us to order kilos and stock up) and just will say "its illegal now" without any time period to prepar, ie withdrawal, get into see doctors, see pain managment etc. 


seems like something those ass-warts would do, just to spite drug users

Odds are they'll give a bit of warning. Might just be a couple weeks though or something. Also if you guys want to potentiate the effects of kratom, DXM has been working wonders for me. I have a decent tolerance and 30mg of DXM with ~8 grams of good kratom is enough for me to nod.

yes, i tried this once and I was nodding out hardcore, like heroin-like nods (this was with no tolerance....other experiments when i had K tolerance just made me feel kind of sick adding 100mg of dxm)


i never tried with 300 of dxm because thats enough to actually have me tripping on dXM alone

^ don't do it.   Try some mxe or pcp, you'll love life.


if you aren't on the pills for pain....they make you more depressed,  ive been on and off of opiates several times and my depression is always much worse while taking opiates...even while not withdrawing...if i'm not peaking I'm angry and depressed


why are you so depressed anyways?  unless you've got some permanent health problem making life unbearable shit passes, life changes if you try to change it...if you keep taking pills nothing will ever get better.

0. Taper (or if you are not dependent ditch) all the above mentioned drugs to a minimum

1. Go to a store, that sells Kratom (online preferred)

2. Buy Kratom

3. Brew Kratom tea

4. Drink Kratom tea

5. Probability of enlightenment in a predefined future time span is increased by 238,4% (if you had a habit with hard drugs before trying Kratom, otherwise the increase is 0-5% )

With the election results I'm a little more concerned that it might be scheduled. However, I'm inclined to believe that the DEA doesn't want that kind of attention, so I doubt theyll follow through with the emergency schedule. I think the DEA will leave it up to Congress. 


All speculation of course

They've cared what other people think since a bipartisan group of representatives from both Congress and the Senate wrote them formal letters explaining that they're overstepping their authority. Congress can take away their emergency shceduling powers as easily as they gave them.


This is why I think Congress is going to have a large say in whether kratom ends up schedule I. We'll soon find out how many reps are having their pockets padded by pharma companies

I'll "quit" whenever they announce the ban...again, besides I think I  like kratom more being addicted to it than not.  As sad as that sounds I kind of get off on the  daily cravings and  putting myself in withdrawal...and even though the w/d is fairly mild I  love  the feeling of  content  I get from a nice big dose topped with a  bowl of my finest herb. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

**Traveling with kratom on a flight (as long as you're in a state where it is legal)**


Hello everyone, I wasn't able to access the thread specific to the subject of bringing kratom on a plane so I thought maybe I should just post my experience here. I've seen a lot of chatter on the web by people who are concerned with the issue of being allowed to bring kratom on a plane, and in light of the recent DEA attacks on kratom's legality and the legal grey area it is now in, I figured my own very recent experience might be of use to someone concerned about this issue. I rely on mitra for relief from nearly crippling sciatic pain and was preparing to fly for a 6 day trip to southwest Florida. Not surprisingly I was concerned about what, if any, concern the TSA might have about me bringing more than half a pound of a powdered obscure and exotic herb which most people have never heard of. Clearly is could appear suspicious to them, and perhaps some TSA agent might have thought I was really smuggling something else in a bag marked as kratom. I went through security with the kratom (which was in a foil lined bag to keep it fresh) in my carry on luggage, and I even had a large kitchen scale in my personal carry on. After going through the scanners, the kitchen scale was not noticed or examined after being x-rayed, however my carry on luggage was set aside for examination. I am almost certain the only reason it appeared suspicious on the x-ray was due to the foil lining of the bag. Long story short they scoured through my clothes to find the bag, and without even opening it all they did was swab it with some kind of patches which are either designed to detect explosive/combustible material or possibly narcotic residue. After swabbing it, and waiting approximately 90 seconds to see the results with the swabs, they calmly returned my kratom to the same place it had been in  my bag and I was free to go. 

So, in summation I was given very little grief about carrying the herb on a flight (despite the bad name it's been getting thanks to the media and especially the DEA/FDA). My only suggestion to anyone flying with it while it is still and hopefully continues to be legal and available to all of us who rely on it for better quality of life is to keep it contained in whatever package/container/pouch it came in, with the label of "kratom" being clearly visible and untampered with. Most TSA agents probably haven't even heard of it, and with this being the case they don't ask much questions. They might swab it's container, but only if they notice it, and if it is kept in a plastic container without any kind of metallic lining they will likely not even notice it or be suspicious. I hope this helps someone.

I've flown with it a few times recently. TSA asked me to keep it separate from my other belongings when going through security, but they never ask what it is. They just give it a funny look, make sure it's not a hazard, and pass it back to me. They're looking for public safety threats, not drugs (real public safety threats). Unless you're obviously carrying an illicit substance, they're not going to bother.

Guess I'm not the only one who quits regularly because of the putrid taste. Sometimes takes me like 30 minutes to get up the courage to down that stuff. The taste gets worse over time as well because your tongue adapts to the bitterness, which normally covers up the other awful flavours. The one upside is that food tastes incredible after.

I have a horrible time getting off kratom. I get huge anxiety attacks at night. Sleep is impossible for days on end. I tried tapering with stem and vein, which is supposed to be weaker. Chills, depression, lethargy and a huge feeling of stress. I am having chest pains and I worry about my heart. I don't do any other drugs except for light cannabis use. I used to love this drug, but now I want to get it out of my life. Any thoughts?

It sounds like you have a general anxiety issue. Might be worth seeing a doc about a long acting benzo. Basically I'm saying most of those symptoms are unrelated to kratom.

yes....and i can get by on only 2 grams a day if i don't feel like being high from it,  but 0 grams a day and I can't sleep, throat gets tight, anxiety peaks.


although i don't know if its depression that i have, it feels more like bipolar to me....and kratom exacerbates it...but i see the part were I get to feel high as being worth it

thats quite a habit, that will do it.   try some pcp after a taper and jump off, thats what eliminated my withdrawals enough when i CT fentanyl until enough time had gone by that when i stopped the pcp the fent wd was almost done

Yeah, 20 grams a day for a year...not good.


I didn't give up on quitting Kratom cause of depression from withdrawal, went 77 days without, but then life sucked and I was reminded nothing else gives me instant joy in 45 minutes...


I'm gonna try to stop again for as long as I can when I run out of what I have in a few weeks because I'm not as productive on my off days and wont' submit to dosing more than 4 days a week, and I can't have 3 unproductive days a week anymore, and I won't use hard drugs like heroin, but Kratom is safe, and damnit, it just feels good.


Hell, it makes my eczema 3 times worse than it already is, and still I like it.


I can and will do without when I choose to, proven I can...it's not the withdrawal that sucks, but the lack of something with immediate good effects....like any drug, and with a good safety profile.


I remember in Drugstore Cowboy the main character said "most people don't know how they are going to feel from moment to moment, but a drug user does...he just reads the label on the bottle" LOL.

4 days a week? are you sure you are not physically dependent?        I currently have a very low opioid tolerance, and a high dose of kratom one day can hold me over so that I can go 2 days without and feel good.   but a low maintenance dose leaves me requiring another dose the following day.


the other day I did about 10 g over the course of the day plus 2 roxies and I was high for the next 48 hours and didn't need kratom till the third day


you say that you dose pretty high, are you sure the residual kratom in your system isn't just holding you over until the next dosing day?

Well yes, when I dose 4 days a week I am TO SOME extent physically dependent, but not so badly that I can't usually get through the 3 days without dosing.


That is probably due to so much in my system from other days because of how much I take though.


But this past week I had to start getting my shit together to start work again (I work in a college so I have winters off)...so I have only dosed once in the past week, 3 days ago, and I can now feel the tiredness and depression lifting.


I've gotten off it a few times now.


What I'd say is I'm LESS physically dependent at 4 days a week than one who takes it 7 days a week...and I think even less than one who takes MUCH less than me if they take it EVERY DAY.


That is up for debate, but I can't help but think that reminding your body you need a FRESH dose every day is worse than any amount left over from previous days.


I will be trying to cut back to 3 days a week, and preferably no 2 days in a row if I can resist the temptation LOL...and try to AT LEAST temporarily stop for 91 days or more within the next month (I say that number because my record  was 90 days and I want to break it).


So yeah...it's a certain level of physical dependence, but I've never had more than SUPER minor RLS, and was told if you don't get BAD RLS your dependency isn't THAT bad.


I'd say that at my maximal doses I have a moderate depenency.


The worst was last month I went 4 days in a row taking my super high doses, and another 5th day in that week which is the only time I've gone 5 in a week  or more than 3 in a row.


That resulted in 4 pretty damn uncomfortable days, 1 somewhat uncomfortable day, on the 6th it was all psychological, so much that doing some shit to cheer me up made the depression go away, and figured I was pretty much off it by the time I dosed on day 7...there could NOT have been much less in my system.


So yeah...some level of dependency...much less this week...but I still believe that refusal to dose more than 4 in a week...even at my heroic doses, keeps me somewhat out of the danger zone of those who just wake up and take it every single day.


Because once you've told yourself you can take it EVERY day, and your tolerance is as high as mine....yeah, there's no way that's turning out well lol...

Has anyone else noticed a really good synergy between Kratom and a benzo? I am prescribed Xanax daily 1 mg but by no means take it daily bc I am very well aware of how severe benzo WD can be. But on a day I do take a Xanax, the Kratom feels amazing. More so than normal. 


It has also helped when I WD from Kratom bc one of my worst symptoms is anxiety. It cures that and since I don't have a tolerance to the Xanax, it also helps me sleep. Phenibut helps with the sleep aspect of WD too but I refuse to take it more than 2 days in a row. But after 2 days, most of the Kratom Wd has passed with the exception of some night sweats. I also find that miserable. Does anyone know of anything that can help with that symptom?

**"Pure Kratom 100x Extract" Capsules**


Anyone tried these? Trying to get an image on here but I'm having trouble posting it. It's a green package with white/yellow text, and the capsules themselves are yellow (2 or 3 per package depending on which you buy).


I am a relatively heavy kratom user, with Bali "OG" powder being my go-to. I would never recommend that anyone buy Kratom from a head shop due to the inflated prices and inconsistent quality, but these capsules are something else. 


They feel, after an hour or so, like I just smoked a solid joint. They work regardless of the tolerance I have to my daily Bali dosing, which leads me to believe that they have something else in them other than Mitragyna Speciosa. 


Let me know if y'all have tried these or have any information on them.

lots of people saying its laced with synthetic cannabinoid RCs on reddit and drug forum

Yeah, this made me incredibly angry.  Schedule Fucking I for CBD oil... this is unabashed tyranny.  Christ.  It's as if the DEA wants you to take incredibly addictive benzodiazepines and other GABAergics for seizure control, which requires inhumanly large doses, and creates a drug dependency problem like none other.  Meanwhile, CBD, which is non-addictive, and is far more efficacious than the poison being peddled by Big Pharma, is supposedly one of the most dangerous drugs on Earth, where possession of CBD is no different than violently assaulting and/or raping/murdering someone in the eyes of the law.  


 If you honestly believe that the DEA is not in collusion with the pharmaceutical industry, then you are either ignorant of the facts, or you work for them.  To be honest, I don't think it would matter if Clinton won the presidency when it comes to DEA overreach.  She is, after all, behind the mass incarceration of black "super-predators" and stiffened penalties for drug offenses.  If only Bernie Sanders had some fucking balls and put up a fucking fight in the end.  He would have demolished Trump.

I just don’t understand how the CBD being illegal thing can work, because at least in the states where WEED is legal, then CBD MUST be legal because weed has CBD in it!!!


And does the fact that CBD is illegal in certain states, like lets say if it’s illegal in Pennsylvania, so then what would happen if they tried to make weed legal in Pennsylvania?


Would the fact that CBD is illegal there and weed has CBD in it make it IMPOSSIBLE to legalize weed in any and all other states where CBD is legal??


They can’t do that right??


This just doesn’t make sense.


Also, Hilary was NOT for the “mass incarceration of blacks”.


The “super predator” comment was totally taken out of context during a very particular time in the 1980s when it just so happened to be that Central Park was a much more dangerous place than it is now and the majority of people committing murders in CP were black and so she referred to the people committing the crimes as “super predators”.


I am not even sure she ever said “black people” specifically either, but even IF she did, people make slip ups in what they say that don’t support their views, it’s just that people parse every single word politicians say.


She was NOT for incarcerating black people.


She IS Anti-drug though, and it’s fucking retarded.


She said that “Marijuanna needs more research before it should be legalized” haha, what a joke.


I liked Bernie MUCH better.


But I’d MUCH rather have Hilary as president than Trump.

Kratom misery:  Unfortunately that's what happens after long periods of kratom use for a lot of people.  The exact mechanism would be tough to point out because of the many different active compounds in the plant material as well as the complexity of our mind & body.  I've been using kratom quite a bit lately; last semester at uni I got a 4.0 in all my classes and I attribute that to kratom use (which means little to no alcohol use or other drug use, consequently, and that's why I take kratom).  The downside is the anxiety that may come with its use, especially when taking 20+ grams a day.


During winter break I jumped off the kratom, it wasn't too bad, but I used loperamide and alcohol.  I felt much better very quickly and the withdrawal was so much milder than I thought it was going to be, I think that's where most of the anxiety came from, the thought of withdrawal.  Taper off man, or just flush it down the toilet and hold on.  You'll be thankful you did it I bet, it sounds like you're subconsciously motivated to get off the stuff.  I wouldn't recommend the alcohol part, but a small dose of loperamide 4-6 hours after your last kratom dose (and maybe 2 or 3 subsequent smaller doses) would give you a very smooth landing my friend.


Take care!

Yes, they are addictive.


Yes, they have side effects.


So do all drugs.


But they have legit medical uses and are LIFE SAVERS for those who need them.


Let people make their own fucking decisions about what drugs they want to put in their bodies.


And this isn’t even for recreation but FOR RELIEF.


I haven’t gotten worse anxiety from my benzo use, and I haven’t had many negative side effects.


They COULD happen down the line, but it’s a risk I’m willing to take for now and later on if I want to try to get off them (which in theory would be nice some day) then  I will, but NOT based on anyone telling me I SHOULD (UNLESS  it’s a doctor telling me I’m going to do PERMAMENT damage that will be REALLY bad if I don’t).


Yes, this is a harm reduction site, but I think people forget about PSYCHOLOGICAL harm reduction (i.e. helping people use certain substances safely if those substances really CAN improve their state of mind, help them emotionally or physically).


Don’t throw out the baby with the bath water.


Every one jumps on benzos saying they are so horrible, but when the shoe’s on the other foot and you have a serious anxiety disorder that responds to nothing else, then unless you are a doctor (and really, even if you are IMO) you shouldn’t be talking.


Our bodies, our choice.

I know cross tolerance has been discussed before but I guess until I just experienced it, I wasn't a true believer that Kratom can either cause traditional opiate tolerance or perhaps utterly block the effects of traditional opiates. I'm a believer now. 


I ended up going to the dr for severe lower back pain and was diagnosed with a kidney infection. They prescribed hydrocodone 7.5 for pain relief. While it's apparent by my username that I used to have a serious oxy habit, let it be known that since discovering Kratom back in August 2016, I haven't taken a single opiate. During my oxy addiction, if I ever took a few months break, my tolerance would significantly drop. Well, I did not feel or get pain relief from any of the hydrocodone. I can only reason that this is due to my Kratom use. 


This stuff has has more power than I originally respected it to have. While the Kratom did provide some pain relief, I was worried about taking it with a kidney infection since nobody really knows how harsh Kratom might be to one's kidneys. Needless to say, I was perplexed by this experience.

I know this is likely going to sound insane, but I must know, since I've been considering making the switch, there's no possible way to inject Kratom, is there? I mean, I know to most of you, that probably sounds silly, but I've never even seen the stuff, I've only ever read about it, and I never really hear much about various methods of ingesting it, only about teas and such. I like to inject my drugs, it's a thing. I even inject my subutex... though I have sound reasoning behind that. Because I have Chrones  disease, my tolerance for ANYTHING is astronomically high. Even doctors are amazed at the levels of substances I can and have and have HAD TO put into my body at certain times, and the fact that in 16 years of doing so, I've never overdosed. At 15 I had spinal meningitis which was so painful my body was going into shock. I really had only ever taken a few lortabs here and there at that point, I mainly just sold my moms that I would find for extra money behind her back... anyway, they gave me several morphine shots that didn't not even SOMEWHAT relieve the pain before they finally put me on a high dose dilauted drip... they were amazed. However, it's not because I'm a "badass" or a "beast", as those who know me have put it... it's because I have a condition that processes things at an alarmingly high rate. And compound that with a hyper-thyroid that's unmedicated, and a heroin addiction from hell, and you've got a money pit like you've never seen. Which also makes using highly frustrating and not really fun at all anymore. Before my last treatment, and before the AG and FTC took everything my boyfriend and I had, over $1.7 million in bank accounts, and all credit cards, who KNOWS show much total, along with my brand new 2017 Range Rover Evoque that was purchased in the full amount with a check from the company account that he wasn't no longer actively running, but was still part owner, this drawing a check from it monthly... due to his ex-wife's SUPER SHADY business practices (that's putting it lightly) I was doing an 8 ball of boy a day, at LEAST 5 Xanax XR's, and usually about a gram of "girl" or 10-20 20 mg adderalls if I couldn't find decent "girl". I was also smoking at least a gram of weed with it and about 3 nights a week, downing several bottles of wine, champagne, or half to a whole bottle of whiskey... and to sleep, OTC dyphenhydramine pills. I liked the semi-trippy  effect. But I started having to take so many at a time that the 100 Ct would only last 3 or 4 days, so I did put the stop on that before treatment. Now though, that I've found a steady, reasonable subutex connect, I've been keeping my heroin intake between $40 and $80 a day, which, in Bama is about .40 or .80 of a gram. And I don't add anything else but THC. And some days I solely do the subutex. And if I dissolve a full one of those and do a 50cc shot, I stay well for a day and a half and can get at least another shot like that out of it. It delivers the full amount of bupe into your system intravenously... if I just take them sublingually, I literally get NO relief at any milligram. So the discovery that I could do this and the fact that it works so well has saved my life, my finances, my health hasn't definitely improved, and my relationship. But I'm hoping Keaton can also be injected! HOWEVER, due to this fact that I of course, get NO buzz from it, the heroin craving stays in full force... even after a 3 month stint in recovery again. Once, I had 7 years, thru a 12 step program and it worked beautifully, but after I stopped doing the things that were suggested, and went thru some super painful, stressful, and depressing things, I picked up again pretty quickly. After 7 years sober, I know what I need to do to get and stay sober, and even doing those things with all the willingness and reasons TO do it in the world, the craving/obsession wins and I use again. So I'm hoping kratom will eliminate or even eradicate these relapses.

Don't inject kratom, it's a plant and can contain bacteria etc, plus you'd need to inject grams of it and it's not really water soluble

I heard that friend. It's KILLING my relationship. As a matter of fact, even though I'm doing INFINITELY better than I was (i.e. Getting out of bed, not being super dopesick all the time, lowering my tolerance so that I don't need more than $40 worth of boy a day, or half a subutex, so I'm not blowing money like I was either, I'm showering regularly, was keeping the house clean again, because I wasn't always sick and dirty from not taking care of myself, our sex life was becoming HIGHLY active, since of course, with a lower ingestion amount daily, I could get off again, my moods were more stable, my eating habits normalized, I got registered to start school on the 1st and got and started a job... still, he kicked me out. Which, I would've understood months ago. But since Dec. 17th, I haven't even asked him for money... he would put gas in my car and buy my smokes, which was fine with me. I hustled my own money to support my habit so as not to take away from us... I haven't had to work up until now, we were WELL off financially, until a recent patch of bad luck where we lost over $1.7 million... but he still gets a pension from his pro sports career. 10 years ago. Still, he asked me to move out, bc my sub girl didn't have anything, and I had to go get a bit of he other the other day, and he lost it. I was honest. Again, didn't use our money etc. but it was my first day on my new job and I also had a meeting with the financial aide counselor for school... I couldn't be sick. I just don't understand. So something has to give! I'll say a prayer for you and yours. I lost the love of my life to this "disease" once, and spent he last 3 years killing myself over it.. I don't know if I'll make it thru losing another one.

I'm just saying it might be better to try some other methods instead of the first and foremost choice being a long acting benzo, that's all.

Ok well I'll agree with you on that.


I just don't like it when people say that no one should ever use benzos or use them long term even if needed.

Imo you should start with 3g and add half a gram every 30min if you don't feel enough, but I haven't taken kratom in a while, so wait for some others to chime in

I agree with 3 grams that way you can see how you react to it. 5 grams would most likely be fine but it could make you nauseas since you're not used to it or  if you have a sensitive stomach...throwing up kratom is not fun. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

Would taking  morphine  like a week ago affect this at all, or combining  with alcohol

A one time morphine dose probably wouldn't affect it that much but they are somewhat cross tolerant. It would be a bit hypocritical if I said don't combine kratom with alcohol seeing as I'm on it right now ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) HOWEVER I am a daily kratom user and have been using it for years so my stomach has become accustomed to it. A couple years ago I couldn't take both together,  the buzz was great but after a couple hours I would throw up,  many times and this was only with 2 ounces of vodka.

That's a lot of vodka lol. These days I rarely touch true opiates and just  stick with kratom, nicotine, alcohol and cannabis which synergizes amazingly with kratom IMO.

> **Today** I just received my shipment of Kratom sampler pack from <snip>.. I was always real suspicious about the stuff while reading into it and studying it. I been spending so much money monthly on Oxycodone plus my contact and my supplier are becoming more and more unreliable. Either he does not have them anymore or he ends up doing them all and not selling them. I am not addicted to them since I only use them on the weekends to enjoy my time but im kind of tired having to rely on these things to have a good time SO I made my decision to try Kratom. Today I tried 2 grams of Green Maing Da,,, didn't feel anything then did 2 more. I had my doubts about this stuff but WOW... I was not expecting that... It slowly hit me with in 30 minutes and it felt pretty good. It actually gave me some really good euphoria.. comparable to my Oxycodone. I little different but also very same.. I am not disappointed and hopefully I can keep my tolerance low on this stuff so I can use It maybe as a permanent replacement of Oxys. Was anyone else successfully able to use Kratom as an ultimate replacement from your drug habits? How was your experience on Kratom? :D

**Kratom = WOW (Strain?)**


Hey y'all, sorry was on vacation for couple weeks, but anyway...


Back story:

So before I planned the vacation, I relapsed on opiates for the 2nd time in almost 3.5 years, a couple days before Christmas, and the first time was this past October, for thank god only a 3 week run. Still ashamed I blew all that clean time off opiates. But as the vacation date got closer, so did my fears of withdrawal, since I didn't plan on being dumb and sneaking drugs thru customs, I decided to order enough powdered kratom to last me. 

But I was really scared and even regretted my decision completely while on the plane, why? Well because I was always a doubter of kratom, I never expressed my doubts since I never tried it but I was almost sure it didn't work like they say...


Conclusion:

i was wrong for damn sure....Now I don't understand how people don't think it completely eliminates withdrawal lol, because it did for me at least. Very impressed and very upset I never gave it a shot sooner. Why it's not used instead of suboxone beats me. It should be studied more, so they can replace it with other narcos, and so we know the long term health effects (if any at all) . 

What I enjoyed most is that this life saving leaf doesn't achieve that real opiate high, so it doesn't make u fien, crave, ruin ur life, etc.. but comes with confidence, energy (depending on strain) , and mild euphoria. It's like it's own unique high.

Now I ordered more and received it and I plan to continue this for about 3 months only , BUT I do know that it comes with withdrawals that people say are quick but just as harsh as a true opiate WD. But I'll look more into it wen that time comes, but for now...


Question on Euphoria:

What strain do you guys feel has the most opiate like euphoria?? And if I wanted to achieve that, how much should I use w/out getting nauseas? Because I usually take it easy (6-8gs) but only once did I take 11-12+ grams and I def got nauseous. Wasent enjoyable the least to say haha..


Also I have a stupid high tolerance to opiates. I Had a 7 year run with heroin and then achieved much clean time before fucking up, but wen I did mess up with in 2 weeks the amount of use was just as high as it ever was and my WD's were killer , felt like my 7 year run WDs, smh, it's remarkable how our bodies remember those chemicals so well!


Anyone with kratom and/or opiate experience, please help to let me know what strain/amount etc..!!


Thanks !!

Your not going to really find an opiate euphoria like opiates with Kratom,i suppose the best strain for that kinda thing is the one everyone calls Bali...The thing is the more you take to try and reach an opiate type high will make you sick,so don`t.


Just take Kratom in small doses twice or thrice a day6 or 7 grams at a time,but being an opiate addict you will find this hard because really you want an opiate high but you will find in the long run this won`t happen,take it for what it is,the more you try to achieve the opiate thing the more likely you will go back to opiates.

Thanks for quick response, though it does not seem that way , I am completely aware that chasing an *actual opiate high will lead back into addiction and that is something I have not done, only once did I have a cup over 9 grams and it was at about 11gs and yes I did get nauseas . I do see that there may be no way around that, but still wondering if people have without the nausea.

That being said , I am still wondering which one has the CLOSEST effect to a opiate like euphoria. And thank u for ur response of Bali..

I've done plenty of kratom then later taken Xanax and never had any issues. Some people say that Kratom is a cns depressant which I have not experienced but if it is for you then keep that in mind when mixing them. 


I see your post is from yesterday so most likely you have already mixed them. Did you like the results?

Im still here

.No significant negative effects as far as the mix went ..After all 1 blue xanax and 3 grms of kratom is not alot i was more worried about waisting my kratom than anything. Usually anytime im humming off of any opiate feeling i will wait till its over with before any types of benzo are taken..Simply because xanax kills a nice opiate buzz for myself matter of fact the only thing that really works with my tolerance is some good clean methamphetimine .. But it must be clean and that will make any job an ease..but i warn u guys that mixing chemicals to get a euphoric effect is not smart due to creating a hole new dependecy ..in example where i use to be content with a handfull of norco 10's after i seen the effects mixing with speed "meth" how it totally makes the endorphines flood gate lay down and wide open , then after doing this for so long now i no longer can acheive my daily cocktail by doing the opiates alone so having one without the other is simply only half way where need to be ...but srry bout the added life story but thats that.

Yes i second that notion .. The red bali seems to give me the touch of an mild opiate effect ..I have the white veined indo and never felt anything near what I was looking for but beleive it or not the one time i did was due to the way i was doing it..check it out ..Every time id take single ply of tissue and drop me like 5 grams in middle of tissue using indo white make a ball put on tounge and look up at the ceiling while chugging water behind it ..needless to say i repeated this one day 3 times in a row with in a 3 minute period and walk out the door to go somewhere . when i arrived i felt ok but in 15 minute later it was a serious deal i could not hardly walk brother i was like on a sea boat and drunk at same time and dude i frigging puked that shit up in the toilet and felt a bit better ( btw i was at my moms house at this point) so i hit the game room and found a lazy boy recliner and ya boy sunk in that bitch it was about 2:30 pm but when i woke up it was dark and im like wow wtf it only felt like id been asleep for 10 minutes. Ok check it the next evening i do a simple toss and wash same water same white indo kratom except this time i didnt parachute it with tissue paper i simply john wayned it ( t&w) spoon full in mouth and slam h2o to wash it dwn . this was probably like 3-4 grams only and 20 minutes later i was at my peak of cocktail ..yes i felt like id been smoking clean speed and taking norco 10..But this peaked around a good hour only so for what its worth bro kratom is some funny iffy shit in my personal experince ya know out of the same pouch one scoop might get u lazy and tommorow out of the same bag one scoop might scrill you thru the roof batman..

discontinuing kratom today and switching to suboxone tonight (0.05 mg at bed time to allow sleep).   Have been having some worrisome bladder pain and frequent urination every time I dose kratom, and inbetween kratom doses it subsides (although not to normal). thought i had found the perfect drug...knew it was too good to be true.


i have been using kratom daily for 4 months....this just started a couple weeks ago.       anyone else experience similar issues?

No bladder pain but I experience the increase in urination anytime I dose Kratom. The increase in urination is especially apparent if I take caffeine with Kratom. I always figured the increase in urine production was a fairly common side effect with kratom.

Same, I'm fairly certain kratom dehydrates you. I am running to the bathroom often when on kratom. No bladder pain though. 


Is it possible you have a something else going  on unrelated to the Kratom?

^ Its possible but the kratom certainly makes it worse everytime i dose.   I get the same thing from 3meoPCP.  maybe my body just can't take all the drugs that have been through it over the years any more.   don't get these problems from amy other drugs besides these two though. 


I'm 48 hrs off of kratom now and the symptoms are totally gone

I just completed a physical. Cholesterol 195 total. That is better than last year at 240 but stopping dairy at times really helps. BP in normal range. Blood, liver, kidneys, and overall health was better this year than last year. All numbers got better including sugar.


I have been exercising a lot so that helps too.


So I have been utilizing nonstop since 2011. And mostly non stop since 2005. I have never felt healthier.  I am healthier than ever and feel it. Of course getting my life together, giving up stronger opiates helps.  My liver was a problem years ago and now in the normal range.  Shooting up random street drugs was pretty unhealthy. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

**Kratom capsule help**


Still somewhat new to the BL community. I have posted once or twice. But am still very unaware of the guidelines and rules around here. SO, if I do or am going against any of them with this post...please know it is unintentional.


Anyway. Been doing a bit of reading about Kratom. I am a very mild opiate enjoyer. Maybe once a month I will pop 25-30mg of Hydro. Thats about it.

I am very interested in trying Kratom. I read good things about the capsule form of this stuff. Im not looking to make tea, or measure it out or extract it. Just a quick, easy kratom experience, via capsule form. I read around, and learned there are different types or "strains" of Kratom. Which one is more desirable and most comparable to a pharm opiate? What is a good beginners dose for this stuff?

So i found a website online. Seems to be pretty legitimate. People off reddit have ordered through them and they have been happy with the results.

The website sells bottles of 50 capsules. Each capsule is 500mg strength of Bali Red Vein. How many mg is a good starting dose?

Jeckyl I noticed each of the strains you listed has a 4g or 5g after them. Is that referring to grams?

3-5 grams is a good starting dose, if you have an opioid tolerance then I'd go with the higher.

Yeah Sorry about that.4 or 5 Grams was how much they sold per package, not a dose recommendation.

Ok cool.

Anything I need to know before taking Kratom my first time? I read about some of the side effects, ie, nausea, sweating etc. 

But that seems more common when taking tea or extract.

I just placed an order for 50 "Premium Bali" capsules through a reputable website. It came out to <no prices>. Which I know is expensive, but this is my first time trying it. So what the heck.

Each capsule is 500mg. I plan on dosing 2g first, (so 4 capsules), and see how i feel.

From what I have read, Bali is the best strain of kratom that simulates an opiate buzz/high. Is that correct?

I personally find vendors to be more important than strains. Bali from one place can be completely different from Bali from another place. However, Bali tends to be more sedating and euphoric if you're getting good leaf

Slow Mobius is correct. Vendor is important.


Considering your current tolerance is low, 2-3 grams is probably a good place to start.


Some people, like myself, don't get much out of Kratom the first few times. I didn't really get much from the 5 to 7 grams I tried the first few times. It just took me awhile to become aware of the effects I suppose. Nowadays I get a decent buzz off of 1.5g.


Buying capsules is convenient but it is a waste of money. If your trying to avoid tasting Kratom you can buy the ground product in bulk and easily make parachutes with toilet paper that are quick and simple to swallow (with a chaser like water or whatever). You won't have to taste the Kratom and you'll be saving money.

I just started using Bali/ Maeng Da at the tail end of an Oxy W/D and it fixed me right up after two days. I was able to go on a date and function normally again. I'm curious if I will still have rough PAWS after I taper off the K though.


Let us know how your new Bali pills work out Opielover..

Again. Im not too sure if the guidlines around here, so please go easy on me. But here it goes, i got these capsules from an online store i heard about through a kratomguide online. The blogger had listed his favorite online vendors along with their quality and customer service. So this vendor referred to themselves online as purkratomdotcom. The reviews on the website said the capsules are full of ground leaf. And the buyers who left reviews say its a very strong strain no matter which one they have bought in the past.

Soooo if i AM happy with the contents in the capsules i receive. I suppose i will end up buying ground bali in a bag and either capsule them myself, or parachute it.

Well Jeckyl I got my bottle of capsules today. The label said the recommended dose was 5 capsules. Which equaled out to 2,500mg or 2.5g. Which i know isnt all that much. But for a first time...WOW. It was so very very similar to a hydrocodone buzz. In fact i took all 5 capsules about 3 hours ago on an empty stomach...and I am still feeling pretty fuzzy. No negative side affects what so ever. I am prescribed ativan for my social anxiety. And i actually prefer the kratom for that. It truley is an amazing herbal remedy for pain and anxiety. First time user here just turned into a life long user. Lol.

I think I may look into a capsule machine. Buy the bali powder through the same vendor, some 00 empty capsules and a little campsule machine and make my own. 

I think tomorrow I am going to up the dose to 3 grams and see how i feel.

Anybody have a preference for capsule packing machines?

Ah that moment when you first fall in love with Kratom. Such a lovely thing.


Sorry, can't recommend a capsule machine as I used one many years ago but don't remember the brand or how well it worked.


I don't remember using it more than once, though, so maybe it sucked. Parachuting is a great alternative as you can store them in a small container but capsules are more legit and less suspicious looking to normal people than toilet paper squares.


If you do end up getting a good capsule machine I'd be interested to know. Wouldn't mind having one if it works well.

While I don't think it's nearly as insidious as benzos, keep in mind that Kratom is a addictive and the effectiveness will wane over time

Nice to hear Opielover! Two fold actually as I'm glad you are happy with Kratom in general and secondly that you (and us) now know of a great vendor. I've been dealing with the convenience and price markup of local vendors like headshops but that will soon change. Can't say I know of an encapsulator worth recommending but I will keep an eye out for the both of us. The OO size trays are under $20 so at least it's not a big investment. Make sure to report back on any other types/ strains of Kratom and I'll do the same. Thanks Opie..

I prefer Oolong or maybe Ceylon Orange Pekoe as far as tea is concerned but encapsulated Kratom doesn't need to be choked down. Stomach problems aren't too bad either but it's no methadone, at least when combating Heroin W/D's. Although 3-4 days in it might have really helped you out...

So what's the deal with Kratom? Even though DEA cracked down, people still have access to it? Kratom doesn't give me a high or euphoria anymore and I'm not addicted to opiates. So I guess I have no use for it anymore. It is certainly a miracle though. If you're going through opiate withdrawal, it's a God send! Helped me get off Tramadol years ago.


Oh, even for cramps during your period, it works miracles. Or even a headache. It has many uses. The war on medical marijuana is the same. Shown to help with menstrual cramps and everything. The government just wants money from it. Your own government wants to kill you by keeping you addicted to opiates instead of a harmless plant that helps. It's disgusting.

Actually the government can make a killing by regulating and taxing these drugs, but instead they're losing money by fighting them. There are a lot of theories about why our draconian drug policies are a thing, but I'm guessing it's some combination of pharma lobbyists, possibly racism, and just the same disinformation being ingrained into kids for generations. 


And the DEA didn't follow through in their emergency scheduling because of the work the AKA did to combat them. However, it's still on their hit list, and legislation that would give the DEA more autonomy to schedule Kratom and designer drugs is currently in the works.

Ya the actual politicians can make a killing from the war on drugs, but the public is losing money by funding the DEA and mass incarceration.

Also, they will make money from people having to go to rehab for opiate addiction instead of taking Kratom to get off of it. Without Kratom, the government isn't needed. People won't be investing more money into rehabs. So it all goes back to them making money, even if it kills you. And they act concerned like Kratom is so harmful, but they want you to remain an addict and die.

I think it's pretty evident from the situation with cannabis in places like Colorado that there is far more return for the economy as a whole when stuff like this is taxed but available. And I thought these people supposedly cared about the economy... It's amazing some of the studies that have been done, assessing the economic costs and benefits of current drug policy versus alternative systems.

So...  Is there any current plans to schedule Kratom? I don't use it often but I like to have it in the cupboard.  Should I stock up? Or are we cool for tge time being?

I forgot that I left my last 250g bag of Kratom in my car months ago. It slid under the seat and has been hiding there  since winter.


Where I live it's been ~100 F most days lately. We even had about a week where it got to around 110 F. The inside temperature of my car must have been easily WELL over 120F most days.


Poor bag of Kratom, I'm sorry.


In a few days my current bag will be empty and I'll start using from the bag that's been in my car. Interested to see if it's degraded. Smells a little different but it's not mouldy or anything.


I bet it'll still be active. People boil Kratom into a tea without destroying the goods so I'm confident. Besides, isn't Kratom grown in tropical regions?. I'll report back.

Someone got me Kratom from a vape shop - I am sure it's low quality as such 


And it's just However if I run out opioids in a couple of weeks I may try it 


I of course have studied it, however it's in powder form so I am wondering, could I just mix it with coffee or does it need prolonged heat to work?(release alkaloids) They sell capsules so it seems like it should work 


Any advice for first time use would be useful, and please note, I have a high opioid tolerance 


Thanks y

You can just take it as is. Look up 'toss and wash' for a classic consumption method. I make tea with normally and I use a teabag so it doesnt mix with the water because it tastes like shit. Many kratom tea recipes online involve mixing the powder in but I find this unneccesary. Classic kratom tea was made with whole kratom leaves too so they didnt drink the powder down (again it tastes like ass). So yeah you can swallow it or mix it into a drink. whatever you feel like


I can't help with info about your opiod tolerance as I don't use it for that, just for occasional mood boost while studying.

well it depends on how much tolerance you has gained under your kratom use.. I founded that my tolerance to oxy went to the roof after taking kratom..  I took maybe 15g / day at that time. didn't feel the oxy at all..

[@twelvefingers](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/478345/) So you can take 15g of kratom (or how much was a single dose of yours?) without getting uncomfortable nervousness? This is my primary concern with kratom as I've read that overdose comes with anxiety, heavy tachycardia etc. but reports are conflicting here.


I don't really feel much from 5g of gold vein, which is the max recommended dose according to the headshop but I don't feel much. It has a verry subtle warmth but it might as well be placebo. So just take another 2.5g or even 5g?


Weird that a partial agonist (apparently it is one, didn't know but somebody mentioned this yesterday) does increase opioid tolerance so much, it should rather be less problematic than the full agonists like oxy, morphine etc. 

Found kratom to be effective for physical withdrawal symptoms though and it seems to produce less of them by itself, at least much less diarrhea, but some runny nose and sweating. Would be great if it didn't cause so much depression and anxiety like morphine does.


Also interesting that kratom is an alpha2-adrenergic agonist which are autoreceptors, thus actually decrease the output of norepinephrine but still seems to be somewhat stimulating in nature.

I've used 5g 3times/day.  it happened I took more but I just felt sick, nausea, puking.. eating candy helped and laying completely still.. not so horrible but really annoying and boring 


I think if you want to be safe just wait 30-60mins before you take more kratom then it will be fine..


nowadays I using around 1gram or less each dose, I've learned that less is more with kratom. but im looking for the mood lifting and energy effects. 


Kratom is little tricky ithink, if I have eaten before a don't feel it at all, (some say it just delays the effect..but I don't feel It at all really)

to use whole pepper grains, tumeric and cayenne pepper seems to helps both the effects to be stronger and last longer.. I dunno really why, im trying to find some info about this.. I guess its have something to do with the stomach acids...

How tiny is the line between good effects and feeling sick? Will you first feel good and a little nauseous like it's possible with e.g. morphine, or does it turn around suddenly (also experienced this with full agonists, when I had little tolerance and took too much all the good effects were gone)?


I don't feel any nausea from 5g gold vein, a little warmth and no uncomfortable stimulation but I unfortunately lack a scale atm, so I just took half of the 10g baggie by eye. Don't know whether to add 2.5g or not.


Weird that you really feel just 1g, maybe my stuff isn't of that good quality. But in past I didn't feel much from other batches / other suppliers either, including extracts.

It seems that some people just need larger kratom doses than others, even without a general opioid tolerance, like they need 10g or more to even feel it while other people are quite content with like 1-3g. Perhaps some people are just better at metabolizing mitragynine into 7-hydroxymitragynine than others?


I started using kratom at around 3-5g and found those doses to be good. After some time I noticed a bit of reverse tolerance, or I just became more aware of the effects, and now I like my doses to be around 1.5-2g. Anymore than that and the side effects begin to outweigh the positives. I can't stand doses larger than 3g anymore, just feels yucky now. But a small 1.5g dose is very nice.


My only complaint about small doses is the very short duration of the peak effects. About ~1.5 hours   after consumption I notice that the main effects seem to be wearing off and the urge to redose rears up. I can find myself redosing like every 2-3 hours from morning to night if I'm not careful. Such constant redosing is a sure fire way for me to produce withdrawals when stopping.

[@MDPV_Psychosis](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/235738/) True.

im also find myself redosing every 3-5h so around 3times/day if I don't do that I crash pretty hard, get foggy and slow in my head..

I've been trying kratom for a while now and don't seem to be getting the effects of it. Perhaps I haven't got the hang of dosing - I use plain leaf powder in gelatin capsules and I take small amounts of kratom extract with it as a booster


Is it easy to take too much and ruin the effects? I see lots of people say less is more with kratom

Eating a small meal about 1-2h after ingesting kratom helps.

I usually dont redose unless i have eaten something between.


Ive had days where i redosed during the Day, and then after dinner it hits me way harder then expected

I've been trying kratom for a long time now, but have never felt what  I assume are 'typical opioid effects' - I  don't know if I'm using it wrongly - taking too much? Too little? wrong strains? etc...

Have you ever taken a prescription opioid before? I'd compare it to taking a low-dose of something like hydrocodone, personally, like taking 10 or 15 mgs or so. But it's also different...I dunno, I've found that it has more of an energizing effect to it, and not so much a sedating effect. 


It seems like it's a highly variable and subjective substance though, generally-speaking. Some people don't care for it at all, either because they've become accustomed to high-strength opioid drugs and that's all they're into now, or they're just a non-responder to it. I know that, for me personally, I'm not really into the extracts that much...even one can make me feel a bit queasy if I hadn't consumed kratom recently. 


Personally I just take a rounded tablespoon of some high-quality kratom powder and wash it down with some iced tea. I'd just try some different strains and products and, if you aren't getting any effects, well, you gave it a try right? High doses of kratom are pointless IMO, after a certain amount all you get is sick from consuming more

Some people don't care for it at all, either because they've become accustomed to high-strength opioid drugs and that's all they're into now, or they're just a non-responder to it. I know that, for me personally, I'm not really into the extracts that much...even one can make me feel a bit queasy if I hadn't consumed kratom recently.

High doses of kratom are pointless IMO, after a certain amount all you get is sick from consuming more

no I haven't taken opioids so I don't really have anything I can compare kratom to. I just fill some capsules with kratom and swallow them over a period of a few hours - I also add in some extract to 'boost' the plain leaf powder.


I haven't really noticed any effects except - as you say - nausea if I consume too much. Haven't noticed much difference between different strains either - White is supposed to be more 'energizing' with Green and Red more sedating...., but I guess Kratom is quite a subtle herb which can affect different people differently

In the beginning 1/2g would give *me *the relief from pain just a effectively as a 5mg hydro w/no apap. Last just as long and maybe longer. The effects also cover more than the pain... hits many receptors that I am confident that we know vert little about.

Can I ask how much (Gs) it takes ya to feel this 10-15mg hydro buz?

How long ya been "on" ktaom?

Well I first learned about kratom probably about 7 years ago. The first time I learned about it was on this website, actually. But I haven't been taking it for that entire time...however, I have taken it for extended periods of time, months and months on end. I've never taken really high doses of kratom, though, just probably around 8 grams per day taken as a single serving.

Came in the convo late sorry I have lost the question.

So~8Gs gives the effects of 10-15 mg hydro in one dose (i can see that but would be sick as fuck if I were to take that dosage at once) and how long does this dose last at relieving pain/discomfort? Is it used for pain? To get high? To stave off withdrawals, To maintain sanity and/or a bank-book balance?

If I missed it: What is the purpose(s) of your particular consumption of this kratom?

I enjoy it just for a bit of everyday recreation. Never really got any kind of w/d symptoms from the dose I take, even with consistent usage. So for me it’s just a mild psychoactive drug to enjoy on a regular basis, without the risk of other substances of its class. It’s energizing and pain-relieving properties are a nice bonus as well, as I work in a physically active occupation which takes a toll on the body and kratom helps with its therapeutic effects

I'm not the person you asked, but here's my thoughts.

I take between 4.5 and 6 mg of red bali kratom once per day. (I buy 48 capsules at a time and usually don't take it every day, just those days where I have some capsules left). It does give a similar effect of lower dose hydrocodone, like 10mg-ish yeah. (Been years since I've taken hydro so I can't say for certain on dosage equivalency)

I haven't timed it, but it seems to last me a good 2-3 hours before it wears off. It comes with some euphoria, uplifted mood, and some painkiller effects. For me, I started taking it to fight off heroin cravings. When I take kratom and for the next day after, I find that I have little to no heroin cravings. But 48+ hours and it's back to the usual.

I imagine kratom can be taken for various reasons. Mine are recreational and to fight cravings/urges for heavy shit.

I wrap it in a little piece of toilet paper and just swallow it. I tried the toss and wash and almost threw up. Been using opiates/H for years now, the only thing kratom seems to do for me at any dose is make me feel OK. I don't feel any mind altering effects but I also don't feel dope sick. I just feel...content. Which is A OK in my book. I really just don't like the amount you have to take. Its A LOT of powder.

On another note, any recommendations as to which kind of Kratom to use? I really only use it when I am dope less. It keeps me neutral lol.

what matters more than anything is finding high quality kratom products, you may want to test out several brands. I'd offer some but I'm in the US and they probably aren't over there.


any of the colors, strains, basically everything is going to aid in withdrawal by similar amounts, the only real difference is the amount of stimulation it provides along with the basic opioid effect... although red strains are generally about 10-20% less potent than green/white strains, this doesn't make them inferior


White is the most stimulating, will keep you awake at night, provides a stimmy dopamine buzz which Red does not, but also has more side effects in high or repeated doses. Green is a mix of white and red, probably the most popular color. Red is the most relaxing, best before bedtime, closest to a real opioid in comparison. Generally I advise people get a mix of a few strains rather than a bigger bag of one. Different vendors and different batches can vary wildly in quality, especially with the state of the international market these days.


If you are going through major withdrawals from good heroin, you're definitely going to want to acquire some extracts if you can afford them. Mostly because extracts can provide a stronger effect with less side effects, and in this regard they are superior to powder.

I been smoking heroin for the last 8 months. Last 2 weeks I upped the dose quite significantly unfortunately. I have stopped smoking on Friday night, then I kinda binged a lot next night and now I have smoked 0.1g heroin.


This is still far less than I normally do. I still have like 5mg xanax, weed and like 0.2g Street level heroin left.


How should I dose the kratom and how would it effect the xanax?

When I was in a similar situation I had to take around 4-5g every 2h to cover the withdrawals, but I didn't have very good kratom at that moment. That started in the morning but by the afternoon I didn't feel terrible so I managed to space out my doses a bit more.


I think you should start with 5g and redose after 1h30-2h until you feel ok. You should start feeling much better after the 3rd day IME.
