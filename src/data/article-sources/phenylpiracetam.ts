## Dosage & Duration

### Oral

**Dosage:**
- Threshold: < 50 mg
- Light: 50 - 100 mg
- Common: 100 - 200 mg
- Strong: 200 - 400 mg
- Heavy: 400 mg +

**Phenylpiracetam** (also known as **Phenotropil** and **Carphedon** ) is a central nervous system [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) and [nootropic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nootropic) agent belonging to the [racetam](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Racetam) family of drugs. Although it is one of the first derivatives of [piracetam](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Piracetam) to be synthesized and documented, research into its properties and efficacy in humans is limited.

Phenylpiracetam is readily available and sold through online vendors as a dietary supplement in the United States. Dosages are commonly reported to be around nearly twelve times those of [noopept](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Noopept) , making it less potent while offering comparable benefit.

Supplementation of phenylpiracetam tends to be in the dosage range of 100 - 300 mg taken over the course of a day, either in two to three evenly spread dosing periods (such as three doses of 100mg or 200mg).

Phenylpiracetam has protected against [scopolamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Datura) -induced amnesia both in rat populations, suggesting it can aid recovery from [deliriant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Deliriant) intoxication and other typically cognitively impaired states by preserving adequate levels of [acetylcholine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Acetylcholine) as a primary mechanism.

Many people report that phenylpiracetam effects (especially stimulation) are more pronounced than other racetams. That may be due phenypiracetam's action as a dopamine reuptake inhibitor and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor.

## Chemistry

Phenylpiracetam is based on the [piracetam](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Piracetam) molecular skeleton with an additional phenyl group attached to the pyrrolidone nucleus, albeit at a different steric location than the substituted phenyl groups observed on [aniracetam](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Aniracetam) or [nefiracetam](/w/index.php?title=Nefiracetam&action=edit&redlink=1) . Due to the chiral center at the fourth position of the pyrrolidinone ring, it can exist in an S or R-isomer; the clinically used form is the racemic mixture.

## Pharmacology

Phenylpiracetam is thought to increase [acetylcholine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Acetylcholine) release within hippocampal cells. As acetycholine is involved in the function of memory, this could potentially account for its reported [nootropic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nootropic) effects.

Phenylpiracetam appears to have a series of trials conducted on it showing improvement in cognition in persons with cognitive decline from organic causes, with one study noting a minor improvement in cognition in those with youth epilepsy.

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*

In comparison to the effects of other nootropics such as [noopept](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Noopept) , this compound can be described as focusing primarily on cognitive focus over that of cognitive stimulation.
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)** - The stimulation which phenylpiracetam presents in common doses can be considered as primarily subtle, comparable to that of [caffeine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Caffeine) , although in heavy doses it can be uncomfortably overstimulating.
- **[Increased heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate)** - This may be a result of the dopamine and noradrenaline reuptake inhibition.
- **[Stamina enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stamina_enhancement)** - This effect is relatively mild compared to other [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) such as [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) .
- **[Headaches](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Headaches)** - This is more prominent at higher doses. It can be promoted by redosing multiple times.
- **[Appetite suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Appetite_suppression)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] ### Sensory effects
 
- Although these effects are not universal, certain people may experience sensory enhancements under the influence of this compound. 
- **[Acuity enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Acuity_enhancement)**
- **[Colour enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_enhancement)**
- **[Auditory enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_enhancement)**
- **[Stamina enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stamina_enhancement)**
- **[Tactile enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_enhancement)** ### Cognitive effects
 
- In terms of its cognitive effects, this compound can be described as a stimulating. 
- **[Analysis enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Analysis_enhancement)**
- **[Wakefulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness)**
- **[Mindfulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mindfulness)**
- **[Anxiety suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety_suppression)**
- **[Thought connectivity](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_connectivity)**
- **[Focus enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Focus_enhancement)**
- **[Motivation enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motivation_enhancement)**
- **[Memory enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Memory_enhancement)**
- **[Dream potentiation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dream_potentiation)**
- **[Irritability](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Irritability)**
- **[Cognitive dysphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_dysphoria)** - This effect typically only occurs at extremely high dosages. ### After effects
 
- - **[Anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety)**
- **[Cognitive fatigue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_fatigue)**
- **[Thought deceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_deceleration)**
- **[Insomnia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Insomnia)**

## Toxicity and harm potential

Several studies suggest that this substance is safe even when high doses are consumed for a long period of time although it is worth noting that the exact toxic dosage is unknown. Anecdotal evidence from those within the community who have tried phenylpiracetam suggest that there do not seem to be any negative health effects attributed to simply trying this drug at low to moderate doses by itself and using it sparingly (but nothing can be completely guaranteed).

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this drug.

### Lethal dosage

The median lethal dosage ( [LD50](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LD50) ) of phenylpiracetam has not been officially published as it has low abuse potential, but is not known to be harmful when exceeding the recommended dosage range.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

The chronic use of phenylpiracetam can be considered as non-addictive with a low potential for abuse. It does not seem to be capable of causing psychological dependence among users, although this fact has not been corroborated by clinical studies. Tolerance to many of the effects of phenylpiracetam develops with prolonged and repeated use. This results in users having to administer increasingly large doses to achieve the same effects. After that, it takes about 3 - 7 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 1 - 2 weeks to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). Phenylpiracetam may presents cross-tolerance with all [racetam](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Racetam) [nootropics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nootropic) , meaning that after the consumption of phenylpiracetam certain nootropics such as [aniracetam](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Aniracetam) and [piracetam](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Piracetam) may have a reduced effect.

## Legal status

Phenylpiracetam, being a member of the [racetam](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Racetam) family, currently is legally available to buy and sell in most countries, but may still vary by region.

- **United Kingdom** - It is illegal to produce, supply, or import this drug under the Psychoactive Substance Act, which came into effect on May 26th, 2016.

Phenylpiracetam, also known as fonturacetam (INNTooltip International nonproprietary name) and sold under the brand names Phenotropil, Actitropil, and Carphedon among others, is a stimulant and nootropic medication used in Russia and certain other Eastern European countries in the treatment of cerebrovascular deficiency, depression, apathy, attention, and memory problems, among other indications. It is also used in Russian cosmonauts to improve physical, mental, and cognitive abilities. The drug is taken by mouth.
Side effects of phenylpiracetam include sleep disturbances among others. The mechanism of action of phenylpiracetam was originally unknown. However, it was discovered that (R)-phenylpiracetam is a selective atypical dopamine reuptake inhibitor in 2014. In addition, phenylpiracetam interacts with certain nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Chemically, phenylpiracetam is a racetam and phenethylamine and is structurally related to piracetam.
Phenylpiracetam was first described in 1983 by Bobkov Iu, et al. It was approved for medical use in Russia in 2003. Development of (R)-phenylpiracetam (code name MRZ-9547) in the West as a potential treatment for fatigue related to Parkinson's disease began by 2014.

## Medical uses

Phenylpiracetam is used in the treatment of a variety of different medical conditions. It is specifically approved in Russia for treatment of cerebrovascular deficiency, depression, apathy, attention deficits, and memory decline. It is used to improve symptoms following encephalopathy, brain injury, and glioma surgery. The drug has been reported to improve symptoms of depression, anxiety, asthenia, and fatigue, as well as to improve cognitive performance and memory. It also has anticonvulsant effects and has been used as an add-on therapy in epilepsy.
Phenylpiracetam is typically prescribed as a general stimulant or to increase tolerance to extreme temperatures and stress.
Clinical use of phenylpiracetam has shown to be more potent than piracetam and is used for a wider-range of indications.
A few small clinical studies have shown possible links between prescription of phenylpiracetam and improvement in a number of encephalopathic conditions, including lesions of cerebral blood pathways, traumatic brain injury and certain types of glioma.
Clinical trials were conducted at the Serbsky State Scientific Center for Social and Forensic Psychiatry. The Serbsky Center, Moscow Institute of Psychiatry, and Russian Center of Vegetative Pathology are reported to have confirmed the effectiveness of phenylpiracetam describing the following effects: improvement of regional blood flow in ischemic regions of the brain, reduction of depressive and anxiety disorders, increase the resistance of brain tissue to hypoxia and toxic effects, improving concentration and mental activity, a psycho-activating effect, increase in the threshold of pain sensitivity, improvement in the quality of sleep, and an anticonvulsant action, though with the side effect of an anorexic effect in extended use.

### Available forms

Phenylpiracetam is available in the form of 100 mg oral tablets.

## Contraindications

Phenylpiracetam has a number of contraindications, such as individual intolerance.

## Side effects

Side effects of phenylpiracetam include insomnia or sleep disturbances, psychomotor agitation, flushing, a feeling of warmth, and increased blood pressure, among others.

## Overdoses

Overdose has not been reported.

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

Phenylpiracetam is a racetam and is described as a stimulant. Racetams have a variety of different pharmacological activities and have varying effects. For example, phenylpiracetam is a stimulant, piracetam is a nootropic, and levetiracetam is an anticonvulsant. The mechanisms of action of most racetams, with some exceptions, are unknown.
Phenylpiracetam is a racemic mixture. (R)-Phenylpiracetam is the most active enantiomer and is much more potent in stimulating locomotor activity than (S)-phenylpiracetam, which is ineffective. However, (S)-phenylpiracetam retains some activity in most pharmacological tests. On the other hand, in one animal test, the passive avoidance test, (S)-phenylpiracetam appeared to be antagonistic of (R)-phenylpiracetam.

#### Dopamine reuptake inhibitor

Experiments performed on Sprague-Dawley rats in a European patent for using phenylpiracetam to treat sleep disorders showed an increase in extracellular dopamine levels after administration. The patent asserts discovery of phenylpiracetam's action as a dopamine reuptake inhibitor as its basis.

The peculiarity of this invention compared to former treatment approaches for treating sleep disorders is the so far unknown therapeutic efficacy of (R)-phenylpiracetam, which is presumably based at least in part on the newly identified activity of (R)-phenylpiracetam as the dopamine re-uptake inhibitor
Both enantiomers of phenylpiracetam, (R)-phenylpiracetam and (S)-phenylpiracetam, have been described in peer-reviewed research as dopamine transporter (DAT) inhibitors in rodents, confirming the patent claim. Their actions at the norepinephrine transporter (NET) vary: (R)-phenylpiracetam acts as a dual norepinephrine–dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI), with 11-fold lower affinity for the NET than for the DAT, whereas the (S)-enantiomer is selective for the DAT. However, whereas (R)-phenylpiracetam stimulates locomotor activity, (S)-phenylpiracetam does not do so. This variation in effects has also been seen with other dopamine reuptake inhibitors.
Other atypical dopamine reuptake inhibitors include modafinil, mesocarb (Sydnocarb), and solriamfetol.

#### Other actions

Phenylpiracetam binds to α4β2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the mouse brain cortex with an IC50Tooltip half-maximal inhibitory concentration of 5.86 μM.
Racetams generally, but including phenylpiracetam, have been described as AMPA receptor potentiators.

#### Animal studies

Research on animals has indicated that phenylpiracetam may have antiamnesic, antidepressant, anxiolytic, and anticonvulsant effects. Additional clinical research is necessary to determine whether these effects extend to humans.
Phenylpiracetam has been shown to reverse the sedative or depressant effects of the benzodiazepine diazepam, increases operant behavior, inhibits post-rotational nystagmus, prevents retrograde amnesia, and has anticonvulsant properties in animal models.
In Wistar rats with gravitational cerebral ischemia, phenylpiracetam reduced the extent of neuralgic deficiency manifestations, retained the locomotor, research, and memory functions, increased the survival rate, and lead to the favoring of local cerebral flow restoration upon the occlusion of carotid arteries to a greater extent than did piracetam.
In tests against a control, Sprague-Dawley rats given free access to less-preferred rat chow and trained to operate a lever repeatedly to obtain preferred rat chow performed additional work when given methylphenidate, dextroamphetamine, and phenylpiracetam. Rats administered 100 mg/kg phenylpiracetam performed, on average, 375% more work than rats given placebo, and consumed little non-preferred rat chow. In comparison, rats administered 1mg/kg dextroamphetamine or 10 mg/kg methylphenidate performed, on average, 150% and 170% more work respectively, and consumed half as much non-preferred rat chow.

Present data show that (R)-phenylpiracetam increases motivation, i.e., the work load, which animals are willing to perform to obtain more rewarding food. At the same time consumption of freely available normal food does not increase. Generally this indicates that (R)-phenylpiracetam increase motivation [...] The effect of (R)-phenylpiracetam is much stronger than that of methylphenidate and amphetamine.

### Pharmacokinetics

The pharmacokinetics of phenylpiracetam in humans are unpublished. In any case, the drug is described as having an oral bioavailability of approximately 100%, as having an onset of action of less than 1 hour, as not being metabolized, as being excreted unchanged about 40% in urine and 60% in bile and sweat, and as having an elimination half-life of 3 to 5 hours. In rodents, its absorption occurs within 1 hour with oral administration or intramuscular injection and its elimination half-life is 2.5 to 3 hours.

## Chemistry

Phenylpiracetam, also known as 4-phenylpiracetam, is a racetam (i.e., a 2-oxo-1-pyrrolidine acetamide derivative) and the 4-phenyl-substituted analogue of piracetam. In contrast to piracetam and most other racetams however, phenylpiracetam contains β-phenylethylamine within its chemical structure and hence can additionally be conceptualized as a substituted phenethylamine.
Phenylpiracetam is a racemic mixture of (R)- and (S)-enantiomers, (R)-phenylpiracetam (MRZ-9547) and (S)-phenylpiracetam.

### Derivatives

RGPU-95 (4-chlorophenylpiracetam) is a derivative of phenylpiracetam described as having 5- to 10-fold greater potency. Cebaracetam (CGS-25248; ZY-15119) is a derivative of RGPU-95 in which the terminal amide has been replaced with a 2-piperazinone moiety.
Methylphenylpiracetam, including all four of its stereoisomers (especially the (4R,5S)-enantiomer E1R), is a positive allosteric modulator of the sigma σ1 receptor. It is currently the only known racetam demonstrating σ1 receptor modulation. Whereas phenylpiracetam stimulates locomotor activity in animals, the E1R enantiomer of methylphenylpiracetam does not do so at doses of up to 200 mg/kg.
Phenylpiracetam hydrazide is a hydrazide derivative of phenylpiracetam described as having anticonvulsant effects.
Other derivatives of phenylpiracetam have also been developed and studied.

## History

Phenylpiracetam was first described in the scientific literature by 1983. It was developed in 1983 as a medication for Soviet cosmonauts to treat the prolonged stresses of working in space. Phenylpiracetam was created at the Russian Academy of Sciences Institute of Biomedical Problems in an effort led by psychopharmacologist Valentina Ivanovna Akhapkina (Валентина Ивановна Ахапкина). Subsequently, it became available as a prescription drug in Russia. It was approved in 2003 for treatment of various conditions.
Pilot-cosmonaut Aleksandr Serebrov described being issued and using phenylpiracetam, as well as it being included in the Soyuz spacecraft's standard emergency medical kit, during his 197-days working in space aboard the Mir space station. He reported "the drug acts as the equalizer of the whole organism, "tidying it up", completely excluding impulsiveness and irritability inevitable in the stressful conditions of space flight."

## Society and culture

### Availability

While not prescribed as a pharmaceutical in the West, in Russia and certain other Eastern European countries it is available as a prescription medicine under brand names including Phenotropil (also spelled Fenotropil, Phenotropyl, and Fenotropyl), Actitropil, and Nanotropil, among others.
Phenylpiracetam is not scheduled by the United States Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) as of 2016.

### Manufacturer

Phenylpiracetam is manufactured by the pharmaceutical companies Valenta Pharm and Pharmstandard (Pharmstandart) in Russia.

### Doping in sport

Phenylpiracetam has stimulant effects and may be used as a doping agent in sport. As a result, it is on the list of stimulants banned for in-competition use by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA). This list is applicable in all Olympic sports. Owing to its unique stimulant properties among racetams, phenylpiracetam is the only racetam on the WADA prohibited list.

## Research

Phenylpiracetam has been studied in the treatment of stroke and glaucoma.
The more active enantiomer of phenylpiracetam, (R)-phenylpiracetam, was under development for fatigue related to Parkinson's disease. However, no recent development has been reported. There was also interest in the compound for fatigue related to depression and other conditions, but this was not pursued. (R)-Phenylpiracetam has been identified as a selective atypical dopamine reuptake inhibitor (DRIs), and similarly to other DRIs, shows pro-motivational effects in animals and reverses motivational deficits.
