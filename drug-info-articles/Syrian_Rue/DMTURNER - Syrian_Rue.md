### INTENSITY

1 to 2. Harmala alkaloids are usually
not potent psychedelics when taken alone. Their main use is to potentiate
other psychedelics.
### SAFETY FACTORS

Harmala alkaloids are MAO inhibitors.
See list of items not to take with MAO inhibitors
in the Safety chapter. The Harmala alkaloids
are emetics and can produce intense nausea if used in large amounts.
### MATERIAL

The Harmala alkaloids: harmine, harmaline,
tetrahydroharmine... are found in a variety of plants. The most notorious
of these is Banisteriopsis caapi, a vine native to the Amazon region
which is an active ingredient of the "Ayahuasca" or "Yage" brews of the
Native South Americans. Reports from Gracie and Zarkov's Notes From
the Underground and Jonathan Ott's Pharmacotheon indicate that
the bark of Banisteriopsis caapi contains between .2 and 1.3% mixed
Harmala alkaloids.
The most concentrated source of Harmala
alkaloids is the seed of Peganum harmala, commonly known as Syrian
Rue. This plant grows in many areas of the world: Africa, the Middle East,
India, South America, Mexico, and Southern U.S. The seeds contain from
2 to 7 % mixed Harmala alkaloids. The majority of my experiments with Harmala
have been done with Syrian Rue, this being the most potent and readily
available source of Harmala.
### SOURCES

Banisteriopsis caapi must normally
be procured in the Amazon jungle. On rare occasions it is sold by specialty
plant and herb dealers who specialize in this type of substance.
Peganum harmala seed can be
picked wild in many of the areas listed above. It can also be procured
from specialty seed and herb dealers, and occasionally as stock for making
dye. Some seed dealers will not ship Syrian Rue seed to California since
a "noxious weed" law prohibits this. Apparently Syrian Rue is a hardy plant
and will take over other vegetation if planted in the same area.

### THE HIGH

The Harmala experience by itself is
generally quite mild, although some acquaintances of mine have obtained
full psychedelic effects from Syrian Rue by consuming small amounts over
the course of a day to circumvent the nausea.
I'm primarily interested in how Harmala
potentiates and enhances other psychedelics. Ingesting a "potentiating"
dose of Harmala produces feelings of subtle energy flowing and a slight
enhancement of perception. Concentrated Harmala may be smoked for a more
mind/less body oriented high, often with feelings of euphoria and relaxation.
I find it a nice alternative to a cannabis high, more meditative and relaxed.
### DOSAGE AND PREPARATION

Approximately three grams of Syrian
Rue seed is required for a potentiating dose. (1 1/4 teaspoons of finely
ground seeds.) Gracie and Zarkov and I all found that a certain amount
of Harmala acts like a switch in potentiating the effects of other psychedelics.
A larger dose does not seem to increase this "potentiating effect" but
only increases the physical symptoms such as nausea. Three grams of Syrian
Rue seems to be a aufficient amount to potentiate other psychedelics without
being too hard on the stomach.
Syrian Rue is prepared by first grinding
the seeds in a coffee grinder. The resulting powder is then put into gelatin
capsules. Using this method it will take about two hours for the Syrian
Rue to take effect. Some users boil the powder for a few minutes to make
a tea which will come on in just one hour, but the taste of the tea is
rather bitter. Lately I've been spreading my consumption of Syrian Rue
over an hours time which further reduces stomach disturbances.
Syrian Rue and other sources of Harmala
can also be extracted. Gracie and Zarkov used vodka as a solvent. The extract
I tried has some advantages over the seed form. It can be smoked, which
produces a very nice high and comes on within minutes. And the extract,
smoked or ingested, seems to produce less nausea and other physical symptoms
for the same intensity of high. However, smoking Harmala won't produce
as long-lasting an effect as ingesting, when used alone as well as when
used to enhance other psychedelics.
### COMBINATIONS

Harmala potentiates many psychedelics.
It has a long history of use as a main ingredient in Ayahuasca or Yage
where it was included to potentiate and enhance DMT. In fact, these brews
would have been impotent without the addition of Harmala since DMT is not
normally active when taken orally. Harmala inhibits enzymes which normally
destroy DMT in the stomach before it can reach the brain. Harmala also
reduces the speed at which DMT is metabolized within the brain.
Harmala adds its own signature to the
experience of the other psychedelics I've tried it with. I experience this
signature as a connection to: the collective unconscious, the earth spirit
(gaia), the evolutionary mythologies and archetypes of the past. It also
tends to tune me into the subtle energies and feelings of the body. Most
of my friends who've experimented with Harmala report similar results.
These aspects of Harmala are perfect to bring an already cosmic high, like
DMT, into a very expanded dimension. A regular DMT experience can feel
like some post-human identity in a distant galaxy aeons in the future.
With Harmala the experience gets linked through the individual identity
to earth, humanity, and the evolutionary history stored within us.
I've tried Harmala with N,N-DMT
and 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, psilocybin, and Ketamine with good results.
Harmala may significantly intensify
and possibly be dangerous if combined with drugs of the phenethylamine
family: ecstasy, mescaline, and 2C-B.

Psilocybin Mushroom, DMT,
and Multiple Combinations chapters.
