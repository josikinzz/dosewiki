## Overview

### Description

This compound belongs to the class of organic compounds known as dibenzocycloheptenes. These are compounds containing a dibenzocycloheptene moiety, which consists of two benzene rings connected by a cycloheptene ring.

### Background

Cyclobenzaprine, a centrally-acting muscle relaxant, was first synthesized in 1961
11
and has been available for human use since 1977.
10
It was initially studied for use as antidepressant given its structural similarity to tricyclic antidepressants - it differs from
Amitriptyline
by only a single double bond.
11
,
10
Since its approval, it has remained relatively popular as an adjunctive, short-term treatment for acute skeletal muscle spasms secondary to musculoskeletal injury.

### Indication

Cyclobenzaprine is indicated as short-term (2–3 weeks) adjunctive therapy, along with rest and physical therapy, for the relief of muscle spasm associated with acute, painful musculoskeletal conditions. It is not effective for treating spasticity due to cerebral or spinal cord disease, including spasticity in children with cerebral palsy
15
,
16
. Cyclobenzaprine is also used off label to reduce pain and improve sleep disturbances in patients with fibromyalgia
9
. It is also approved for the treatment of fibromyalgia in adults
17
.

### Pharmacodynamics

Cyclobenzaprine is a skeletal muscle relaxant that works on areas of the brainstem to reduce skeletal muscle spasm, though its exact pharmacodynamic behaviour is currently unclear.
15
,
16
,
10
Despite its long half-life, it is relatively short-acting with a typical duration of action of 4-6 hours.
10
Cyclobenzaprine has been reported to contribute to the development of serotonin syndrome when used in combination with other serotonergic medications.
15
,
16
,
5
Symptoms of serotonin syndrome may include autonomic instability, changes to mental status, neuromuscular abnormalities, or gastrointestinal symptoms - treatment with cyclobenzaprine should be discontinued immediately if any of these reactions occur during therapy.
15
,
16

### Mechanism of Action

5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 2A
Antagonist

### Absorption

The oral bioavailability of cyclobenzaprine has been estimated to be between 0.33 and 0.55.
8
,
11
,
15
C
max
is between 5-35 ng/mL and is achieved after 4 hours (T
max
).
15
,
10
AUC over an 8 hour dosing interval was reported to be approximately 177 ng.hr/mL.
15

### Metabolism

Cyclobenzaprine is extensively metabolized in the liver via both oxidative and conjugative pathways.
15
,
8
,
10
Oxidative metabolism, mainly N-demethylation, is catalyzed primarily by CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 (with CYP2D6 implicated to a lesser extent) and is responsible for the major metabolite desmethylcyclobenzaprine
15
,
1
,
10
. Cyclobenzaprine also undergoes N-glucuronidation in the liver catalyzed by UGT1A4 and UGT2B10
2
, and has been shown to undergo enterohepatic circulation.

### Half-life

The effective half-life of cyclobenzaprine in young healthy subjects is approximately 18 hours.
8
,
15
,
16
These values are extended in the elderly and those with hepatic insufficiency, with a mean effective half-life of 33.4 hours and 46.2 hours in these groups, respectively.
8

### Toxicity

The oral LD
50
of cyclobenzaprine in mice and rats is 338 mg/kg and 425 mg/kg, respectively. Signs of overdose may develop rapidly after ingestion and commonly include significant drowsiness and tachycardia, with less common manifestations including tremor, agitation, ataxia, GI upset, and other CNS effects such as confusion and hallucinations. Potentially critical manifestations, though rare, include cardiac arrest or dysrhythmias, severe hypotension, seizures, and neuroleptic malignant syndrome.
15
,
16
As the management of cyclobenzaprine overdose is complex and ever-changing, it is recommended that a poison control center be consulted prior to treatment. Typical management involves gastrointestinal decontamination, close cardiac monitoring, and monitoring for signs of CNS or respiratory depression. As cyclobenzaprine exists in relatively low concentrations in plasma, monitoring of drug plasma levels should not guide management and dialysis is likely of no value.

### Mechanism of action

The exact mechanism of action of cyclobenzaprine has not been fully elucidated in humans, and much of the information available regarding its mechanism has been ascertained from early animal studies. There is some evidence that cyclobenzaprine exerts its effects at the supraspinal level, specifically within the locus coeruleus of the brainstem, with little-to-no action at neuromuscular junctions or directly on skeletal musculature
16
,
10
. Action on the brainstem is thought to result in diminished activity of efferent alpha and gamma motor neurons, likely mediated by inhibition of coeruleus-spinal or reticulospinal pathways, and ultimately depressed spinal cord interneuron activity.
10
More recently it has been suggested that inhibition of descending serotonergic pathways in the spinal cord via action on 5-HT2 receptors may contribute to cyclobenzaprine’s observed effects.

### Volume of distribution

The volume of distribution of cyclobenzaprine is approximately 146 L.
11
The combination of high plasma clearance despite a relatively long half-life observed with cyclobenzaprine is suggestive of extensive tissue distribution.
13
,
8

### Protein binding

Cyclobenzaprine is approximately 93% protein bound in plasma.
11
It has been identified as specifically having a high affinity for human serum albumin.
12

### Route of elimination

After administration of a radio-labeled dose of cyclobenzaprine, 38-51% of radioactivity was excreted in the urine while 14-15% was excreted in the feces.
16
Cyclobenzaprine is highly metabolized, with only approximately 1% of this same radio-labeled dose recovered in the urine as unchanged drug. Metabolites excreted in the urine are likely water-soluble glucuronide conjugates.
16

### Clearance

The approximate plasma clearance of cyclobenzaprine is 0.7 L/min.

### General Function

Binds water, Ca(2+), Na(+), K(+), fatty acids, hormones, bilirubin and drugs (Probable). Its main function is the regulation of the colloidal osmotic pressure of blood (Probable). Major zinc transporter in plasma, typically binds about 80% of all plasma zinc (PubMed:19021548). Major calcium and magnesium transporter in plasma, binds approximately 45% of circulating calcium and magnesium in plasma (By similarity). Potentially has more than two calcium-binding sites and might additionally bind calcium in a non-specific manner (By similarity). The shared binding site between zinc and calcium at residue Asp-273 suggests a crosstalk between zinc and calcium transport in the blood (By similarity). The rank order of affinity is zinc > calcium > magnesium (By similarity). Binds to the bacterial siderophore enterobactin and inhibits enterobactin-mediated iron uptake of E.coli from ferric transferrin, and may thereby limit the utilization of iron and growth of enteric bacteria such as E.coli (PubMed:6234017). Does not prevent iron uptake by the bacterial siderophore aerobactin (PubMed:6234017)

  "wikipedia": `# Cyclobenzaprine
*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclobenzaprine*

Cyclobenzaprine, sold under several brand names including, historically, Flexeril, is a muscle relaxer used for muscle spasms from musculoskeletal conditions of sudden onset. It is not useful in cerebral palsy. It is taken by mouth.
Common side effects include headache, tiredness, dizziness, and dry mouth. Serious side effects may include an irregular heartbeat. There is no evidence of harm in pregnancy, but it has not been well studied in this population. It should not be used together with MAOIs. How it works is unclear. In any case, it is known to inhibit serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake and to block serotonin, adrenergic, histamine, and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. Chemically, it is very similar to tricyclic antidepressants like amitriptyline.
Cyclobenzaprine was approved for medical use in the United States in 1977. It is available by prescription as a generic medication. In 2023, it was the 47th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 13 million prescriptions. It was not available in the United Kingdom as of 2012.

## Medical uses

Cyclobenzaprine is used, in conjunction with physical therapy, to treat muscle spasms that occur because of acute musculoskeletal conditions. After sustaining an injury, muscle spasms occur to stabilize the affected body part, which may increase pain to prevent further damage. Cyclobenzaprine is used to treat such muscle spasms associated with acute, painful musculoskeletal conditions. It decreases pain in the first two weeks, peaking in the first few days, but has no proven benefit after two weeks. Since no benefit is proven beyond that, therapy should not be continued long-term. It is the best-studied muscle relaxer. It is not useful for spasticity due to neurologic conditions such as cerebral palsy. It may also be used along with other treatments for tetanus.

### Comparison to other medications

Cyclobenzaprine has been found not to be inferior to tizanidine, orphenadrine, and carisoprodol in the treatment of acute lower back pain, although none have been proven to be effective for long-term use (beyond two weeks of treatment). No differences in pain or spasm scores were noted among these agents, nor when compared to benzodiazepines. However, nonbenzodiazepine (including cyclobenzaprine) treatment was found to have a lower risk of medication abuse and continuation of use against medical advice. Side effects such as sedation and ataxia are also less pronounced with nonbenzodiazepine antispasmodics.
In a study on the treatment of musculoskeletal pain treatment with cyclobenzaprine alone or in combination with ibuprofen, no significant differences in pain scores were noted among the three treatment groups. Peak benefit was found to occur on day seven of the treatment for all groups.

## Side effects

Cyclobenzaprine results in increased rates of drowsiness (38%), dry mouth (24%), and dizziness (10%). Drowsiness and dry mouth appear to intensify with increasing dose.
Agitation is a common side effect observed, especially in the elderly. Some experts believe that cyclobenzaprine should be avoided in elderly patients because it can cause confusion, delirium, and cognitive impairment. In general, the National Committee for Quality Assurance recommends avoiding the use of cyclobenzaprine in the elderly because of the potential for more severe side effects.
Dysphagia, a life-threatening side-effect, may rarely occur. Treatment protocols and support should follow the same as for any structurally related tricyclic, such as tricyclic antidepressants.

## Overdose

The most common effects of overdose are drowsiness and tachycardia. Rare but potentially critical complications are cardiac arrest, abnormal heart rhythms, severe low blood pressure, seizures, and neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Life-threatening overdose is rare, however, as the median lethal dose is about 338 milligrams/kilogram in mice and 425 mg/kg in rats. The potential harm is increased when central nervous system depressants and antidepressants are also used; deliberate overdose often includes other drugs.

## Interactions

Cyclobenzaprine has major contraindications with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). At least one study also found increased risk of serotonin syndrome when cyclobenzaprine was taken with the serotonergic drugs duloxetine or phenelzine.
These substances may interact with cyclobenzaprine:

Central nervous system  depressants (e.g. alcohol, opioids, benzodiazepines, nonbenzodiazepines, phenothiazines,  carbamates, barbiturates, major tranquilizers)
Monoamine oxidase inhibitors taken within two weeks of cyclobenzaprine may result in serious, life-threatening side effects.
Cyclobenzaprine may affect the medications used in surgical sedation and some surgeons request that patients temporarily discontinue its use prior to surgery.

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

Cyclobenzaprine is a centrally acting muscle relaxant with a chemical structure that is very similar to those of tricyclic antidepressants like amitriptyline and imipramine.
Its known actions include serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibition, serotonin 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, 5-HT2C, 5-HT6, and 5-HT7 receptor antagonism, α1- and α2-adrenergic receptor antagonism, histamine H1 receptor noncompetitive antagonism, and muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonism. In terms of its antimuscarinic activity, it is said to be an antagonist of the muscarinic acetylcholine M1, M2, and M3 receptors, but not of the muscarinic acetylcholine M4 or M5 receptor.
The mechanism of action of cyclobenzaprine as a muscle relaxant is unknown. However, it may work through modulating the serotonergic and noradrenergic systems. The antihistamine activity of cyclobenzaprine is thought to play a major role in its sedative effects. Similarly to tricyclic antidepressants, cyclobenzaprine shows antidepressant-like effects in animals.

### Pharmacokinetics

Cyclobenzaprine has an oral bioavailability of about 55% and approximately 93% is bound to proteins in plasma. Its metabolite norcyclobenzaprine (NCBP) is active. The elimination half-life of cyclobenzaprine is 18 hours and it has a clearance of 0.7 L/min.

## Chemistry

Cyclobenzaprine is a tricyclic compound of the dibenzocycloheptene group. It is very similar in chemical structure to tricyclic antidepressants like amitriptyline and imipramine, which are likewise dibenzocycloheptenes. Cyclobenzaprine differs from amitriptyline in structure only by the presence of a single double bond within the tricyclic ring system., being 10,11-dehydroamitriptyline.

## Society and culture

### Formulations

By mouth, cyclobenzaprine is marketed as Apo-Cyclobenzaprine, Fexmid, Flexeril and Novo-Cycloprine. It is available in generic form. A once-a-day, extended-release formulation, Amrix, is available. Cyclobenzaprine is also used by compounding pharmacies in topical creams.

## Research

### Fibromyalgia

A 2004 review found benefit for fibromyalgia symptoms, with a reported number needed to treat of 4.8 (meaning that 1 person out of every 4.8 benefits from treatment) for pain reduction, but no change in fatigue or tender points. A 2009 Cochrane review found insufficient evidence to justify its use in myofascial pain syndrome.
Two Phase 3 clinical trials reported that an experimental sublingual formulation of cyclobenzaprine, TNX-102 SL, was able to reduce pain and improve sleep quality in patients with fibromyalgia. The RESILIENT trial reported significant reductions in daily pain and improvements in various fibromyalgia symptoms, including fatigue and depressive symptoms, compared to placebo. A separate Phase 3 clinical trial evaluated TNX-102 SL in patients with military-related post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and reported the drug did not provide a sustained, significant improvement in overall PTSD severity, but it did demonstrate improvements in sleep quality during the 12-week trial.
On August 15, 2025, the FDA approved TNX-102 SL under the name Tonmya.
