So, I am pretty sure that the supplier that I get 2-oxo-pcm from sends me legit DCK. It's my favorite chemical I've ever had experience with. It feels like a collusion of different drugs, and I rarely experience the same thing twice.

If you don't know for sure 100% which drug(s0 you have, don't take them.  Stay safe.

Brown crystals & not a definite thing? Not sure what the latter is supposed to mean, but this post made me wondering if anyone would touch any yellow-colored powders (unless they are supposed to look that way) or wet solids if they say how messy reactions can go and how carelessly purification processes may be done. I second that if you're not sure what you've got, just don't take it. RC's should meet certain purity standards no matter what.


BTW, brown diphenidine is definitely not a good thing as it *might* be from bromine.

Yes.

Without a proper lab test it's impossible to say what you got, so don't take it.

And substance ID is not allowed here, so I'M going to close this thread, if you have a question/want me to re-open the thread PM me

this is an interesting question. are you currently tripping on the DPH right now or what? comparing it to stims like PV8 and 5-Mapb is a rather far out guess if you're still having a classical disassociative experience. without knowing youre current state it's hard to say. did you test this with a regent kit? I've done MXP plenty of times before and it was always a white crystalline powder that never gave me bruxism, but it felt like a disassociative drug.
