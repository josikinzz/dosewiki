## Summary

Arguably the most common synthetic cannabinoid, AB-FUBINACA was originally developed by Pfizer as an analgesic, but has since abandoned for medical use. It has since found a following in the RC community, however it's extremely high potency and inclusion in synthetic blends makes it dangerous, and it has killed in overdose. Exercise caution.

*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AB-FUBINACA*

AB-FUBINACA (AMB-FUBINACA) is a psychoactive drug that acts as a potent agonist for the cannabinoid receptors, with Ki values of 0.9 nM at CB1 and 23.2 nM at CB2 and EC50 values of 1.8 nM at CB1 and 3.2 nM at CB2. It was originally developed by Pfizer in 2009 as an analgesic medication but was never pursued for human use. In 2012, it was discovered as an ingredient in synthetic cannabinoid blends in Japan, along with a related compound AB-PINACA, which had not previously been reported.
Its use has been linked to hospitalizations and deaths.

## Legality

### United States of America

It was designated as a Schedule I controlled substance in the United States in January 2014.

### Finland

In Finland AB-FUBINACA is scheduled in government decree on psychoactive substances banned from the consumer market as of 19 October 2017.

### Germany

It is an Anlage II controlled substance in Germany as of November 2014.

### China

Since October 2015 AB-FUBINACA is a controlled substance in China.

### Others

In December 2019, the UNODC announced scheduling recommendations placing AB-FUBINACA as a controlled research chemical into Schedule II.

## Mass overdoses due to adulterated K2

On August 15, 2018, 70 people within the city of New Haven, Connecticut, started overdosing near Yale University campus. By the end of the week, the total number of overdosed had risen to over 100 people needing transport to local emergency rooms. Three men were arrested, charged as drug dealers selling synthetic cannabis which contained AB-FUBINACA.  First responders concluded that the overdoses were caused by opiate adulterants, as victims responded to Narcan.   Almost all of the overdoses occurred on the New Haven Green, a large downtown park that is heavily traveled and very popular with the homeless population.  There have been no deaths associated with these overdoses; however, several victims were in critical or life-threatening condition for a period of time.
