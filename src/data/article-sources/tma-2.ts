DESCRIPTION #
 
TMA-2, or 2,4,5-TrimethoxyAmphetamine, is a synthetic chemical that is related to, but more potent than mescaline. It has both stimulant and psychedelic effects. It's qualitative effects on mood alteration and sensory enhancement are similar to mescaline. 
 
[ [Main TMA-2 Vault](https://erowid.org/tma2.shtml) ]
 
[Dose](https://erowid.org/tma2_dose.shtml) #
 
10-50 mg. Dr. Shulgin suggests that there is only a small margin between the dose needed to produce psychoactive effects and a toxic dose (Shulgin, 1976). Toxic dose in humans is not known.
 
Price #
 
Price Summary Needed.
 
Law #
 
TMA is a schedule I substance in the United States, making it illegal to buy, sell, or possess. TMA-2 - TMA-6 are all positional isomers of TMA, making them schedule I substances as well. TMA-2 has been placed in Schedule I by the U.N. Narcotics Commission.
 
Chemistry #
 
2,4,5-trimethoxyamphetamine (TMA-2) is a synthetic chemical which can be derived from the Calamus root's active ingredient Asarone.
 
Pharmacology #
 
TMA-2 is known to be a 5-HT2 agonist.
 
Production #

History #
 
TMA-2 was first synthesized in 1933 and it's psychoactive properties were recognized by A. Shulgin in 1962.

PROBLEMS #
 
Although TMA-2 has some stimulant effects, one researcher found high doses of TMA-2 caused bradycardia (slow heart) and hypothermia (low temperature) in rats (Mallaret 2003, Ho 1970). There are too few reports to sanity-check whether these findings hold true for humans. 
 
 Because of its psychedelic properties, mental health risks are assumed to be similar to those of other hallucinogens and psychedelic-crisis management is appropriate for acute handling of anxiety and panic reactions. More severe schizophrenic or psychotic reactions would be handled as with other hallucinogen precipitated mental crises.
 
Contraindications #
 
- Do not take TMA-2 if you are currently taking an MAOI. MAOIs are most commonly found in the prescription anti-depressants Nardil (phenelzine), Parnate (tranylcypromine), Marplan (isocarboxazid), Eldepryl (l-deprenyl), and Aurorex or Manerix (moclobemide). Ayahuasca also contains MAOIs (harmine and harmaline). 2C-B and MAOIs are a potentially dangerous combination. Check with your doctor if you are not sure whether your prescription medication is an MAOI. Do not operate heavy machinery. Do Not Drive. If you have a seizure or convulsive disorder or heart problems, you may be at higher risk for health problems when taking TMA-2. Diabetics should monitor their blood sugar closely as there have been some reports of problems. Individuals currently in the midst of emotional or psychological upheaval in their everyday lives should be careful about choosing to use psychedelics such as TMA-2 as they can trigger even more difficulty. Individuals with a family history of schizophrenia or early onset mental illness should be extremely careful because psychedelics have been known to trigger latent psychological and mental problems.
 
Addiction Potential #
 
direct data about this exists, but the addiction potential of TMA-2 is considered to be extremely low due to its psychedelic effects. Summary Needed.

**TMA-2**
- REGULATED: Yes
- STATUS: Scheduled
- SCHEDULE: Schedule I
- CLASSIFICATION: Hallucinogen
 
TMA-2 is a position isomer of TMA, which is a Schedule I substance, thus TMA-2 is automatically controlled under U.S. Federal law as a Schedule I substance as well.
 
INTERNATIONAL LAW #
 
Belgium #
 
TMA-2 was added to the list of illegal psychotropic substances on Nov 8, 2004 [ [Moniteur Belge/Belgisch Staatsblad](http://www.ejustice.just.fgov.be/cgi/article.pl) ].
 
Canada #
 
TMA-2 is listed (as 2,4,5-trimethoxyamphetamine) in Schedule III of Canada's [Controlled Drugs and Substances Act](https://erowid.org/psychoactives/law/countries/canada/law_canada_cdsa_2002.shtml#III) , making it illegal to possess or sell.
 
E.U. #

## SYNTHESIS
A suspension of 31.6 g powdered LAH in 1 L anhydrous THF containing a little anhydrous Et2O was brought to a gentle reflux, and then there was added a solution of 40.0 g of 2-nitro-1-(2,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)propene in 200 mL anhydrous THF over the course of 4 h. The mixture was held at reflux temperature for 24 h, cooled to 0 Â°C with external ice, and the excess hydride destroyed by the addition, in sequence, of 32 mL H2O (which had been diluted with a little THF), 32 mL 15% NaOH, and finally with 96 mL H2O. The white inorganic solids were removed by filtration, and the filter cake was washed with THF. The combined filtrate and washings were stripped of solvent under vacuum to give 48 g of an impure amber oil. This was dissolved in 180 mL IPA, neutralized with 30 mL concentrated HCl, and the mixture diluted with 1500 mL anhydrous Et2O. After a short induction period, an oily precipitate separated, which on stirring changed into a loose crystalline phase. This was removed by filtration, washed with Et2O, and air dried to yield 29.0 g of 2,4,5-trimethoxyamphetamine hydrochloride (TMA-2) as fine white crystals with a mp of 188.5â189.5 Â°C. Anal. (C12H20ClNO3) C,H,N. A 4.0 g sample of the free base was dissolved in 15 mL pyridine, treated with 2.5 mL acetic anhydride, heated on the steam bath for 20 min, added to 400 mL H2O, acidified with HCl, and extracted with 3Ã75 mL CH2Cl2. After washing with H2O the pooled extracts were stripped of solvent under vacuum to give 4.5 g of flakey, off-white solids which, on recrystallization from MeOH, were white, weighed 2.3 g, and had a mp of 132â133 Â°C. Recrystallization from this acetamide from MEK did not improve its quality. Anal. (C14H21NO4) C,H,N.


## DOSAGE

## DURATION

## QUALITATIVE COMMENTS
(with 20 mg) âThe first two hours seemed like an eternity, with time passing slowly. Then it settled into a very calm and enjoyable event (not that it wasnât already). The material seemed somewhat hypnotic. I suspect that I would believe suggestions, or at least not challenge them too much. I had a little confusion but it was not troublesome. On reflection, the material was quite good. It was benign in the sense that there appeared to be no dark spots. I would try it again, perhaps at 30 milligrams. Almost base-line after 12 hours, but not quite.â

(with 24 mg) âI took the dosage in two halves, an hour apart. Initially, I was a little nauseous, with light tremors and modest eye dilation. But after another hour, there was the entire package of mescaline, missing only the intense color enhancement. The world is filled with distorted. moving things. Then my little fingers on both hands got periodically numb. And there was an occasional light-headedness that hinted at fainting. The two phenomena alternated, and never got in each otherâs ways. Both passed, once I realized that I would recover from this experience. Then the humor and joy of the world returned. The drop-off was quite rapid from the fifth to eighth hour, and no effects remained at all by the twelfth hour.â

(with 40 mg) âVery slow coming on. Didnât feel it for an hour, but then at a full +++ in another hour. Beautiful experience. Erotic excellent. Eyes-closed imagery and fantasy to music. No dark corners. Benign and peaceful and lovely. There were brief intestinal cramps early, and a little diarrhea, but no other problems. I was able to sleep after eight hours, but had guarded dreams.â

(with 40 mg) âBeautiful plus 3. Some visuals, but not intrusive. Moderate, good-mannered kaleidoscopic imagery against dark. Music superb. Clear thinking. Calmly cosmic. This is a seminal, or archetypal psychoactive material. A very good experience and good for repeats. About 10â12 hrs. Sleep difficult but OK.â


## EXTENSIONS AND COMMENTARY
The unexpected ten-fold increase of effectiveness uncovered by the simple relocation of a single methoxy group of TMA gave the further juggling of methoxy groups a very high priority. There are a total of six arrangements possible for the three groups, namely, 3,4,5- (the original TMA), 2,4,5- (the present TMA-2), and then and in systematic sequence, 2,3,4-, 2,3,5-, 2,3,6-, and 2,4,6. These compounds were totally unknown at that time, and they could and would be assigned the sequential names TMA-3, TMA-4, TMA-5 and TMA-6, respectively. I made them all, and they are all included in this book.

Having found the treasure of 2,4,5-ness, it is instructive to look back at nature, to see what its plant equivalents might be. There are indeed a few essential oils that have their methoxy groups in this arrangement. TMA-2 is thus one of the essential amphetamines, and most of the botanical connections are discussed under TMA. The natural skeleton is found in asarone, with Î±-asarone being trans-propenyl, Î²-asarone the cis-propenyl and Î³-asarone (also called euasarone) being the allyl-isomer. I had mentioned, in the spice cabinet discussion under TMA, the tasting of asarone at up to 70 milligrams without any effects.

A couple of additional experiments involving TMA-2 had been set up and started, but somehow never had enough fire to get completed. Studies on the optical isomers had gotten up to assays of 6 milligrams on each of the separate isomers, but had never been taken higher. The âRâ isomer is much the more potent in rabbit assays, but the human comparisons remain unknown at present. Also, a study of the 14C labeled racemate (5 microcuries in 40 milligrams) was conducted with a view to metabolite analysis, but again, the project was abandoned before any results were obtained. In the rat, the 4-methoxyl carbon appeared as expired carbon dioxide to the extent of about 20%. And this is some four times the amount seen from either of the other two methoxyl carbon atoms.

One final memory in the TMA-2 area. About twenty years ago I co-authored a rather thorough review article in the British journal Nature, that described the structure-activity relationships between the simpler one-ringed psychotomimetics. It also quietly served as a vehicle for mentioning a number of newly-discovered compounds and their human activities. But as a magnificent attestment to youth and brashness, we proposed a complex compound that embraced each and every clue and hint that might tie it to the neurological process. This hybrid monster was 2,Î²-dihydroxy-4,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine. It had everything. The 6-hydroxydopamine  hydroxy group and the rest of the dopamine molecule intact as represented by the two methoxyl groups. And the beta-hydroxy group gave it the final ânorepinephrine â touch. And, with due modesty, we proposed that it might be âan endogenous psychotogen.â Why not âthe endogenous psychotogen?â And then, to compound the picture, what should arrive in the mail a month or two later, and from a most respected scientist, but a sample of just this stuff, synthesized for our investigations. I must have bought a little of my own promotion, as I noted that even after my first four graded dosages with the compound, I was still only up to a 250 microgram dose. And then, as the sample became increasingly brown and was clearly decomposing, the project was finally abandoned.

A sad note on how things have changed since that time. I recently queried the editors of Nature, about their thoughts concerning a twenty year retrospective of this area, written by the three authors of the original review. We had each followed quite divergent paths, but each of us was still keenly the researcher. It would have been a marvelous paper to put together, and it would have delighted the reading audience of Nature, had it been the audience of twenty years ago. But not today. The journal is now dedicated to neutron stars and x-ray sources. The respected old English journal of interdisciplinary interests is not the grand and curious lady she used to be. The Editorâs reply was polite, but negative.  âSuch an article would be unsuitable for publication in Nature at present,â they said. And, I am sad to say, theyâre right.

And I am afraid that the American counterpart journal, Science, has suffered a similar deterioration. It, too, has abandoned multidisciplinary interest, but in a different direction. They are now dedicated to chromosomes, and nucleotide identification, and are totally captivated by the attention paid to, and the apparent importance of, the human genome project. There is where you automatically go to publish, now, if you have unraveled some DNA sequence from the Latvian cockroach.

**2,4,5-Trimethoxyamphetamine** (abbreviated **TMA-2** ) is a synthetic [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Substituted_amphetamine) known to produce a unique spectrum of [hallucinogenic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hallucinogenic) and [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) effects that differ substantially from other psychoactive [phenethylamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamines) . TMA-2 along with [TMA-6](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/TMA-6) and others are members of the trimethoxylated family of phenethylamines. Members in this family been observed to produce a complex mixture of [hallucinogenic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hallucinogen) , [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) , [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) and [entactogenic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entactogen) effects that qualitatively separates it from other psychedelic phenethylamine compounds like members of the [2C-x](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-x) or [DOx](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DOx) series.

TMA-2 was first synthesized by Viktor Bruckner in 1933 , but was not investigated as a psychoactive chemical until [Alexander Shulgin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alexander_Shulgin) synthesized and tested it in 1962 . Shulgin published his synthesis and initial research findings in a 1964 paper, describing the effects as similar to [mescaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mescaline) , though lacking in color effects, producing less nausea and prone to causing anxiety and restlessness. .

There are occasional references to the use of TMA-2 in early 1970's counter-culture publications , describing the drug as being rarely produced for sale and expensive in comparison to [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) . This suggests that there was only very limited human usage of TMA-2 between its invention and the publication of its synthesis and pharmacology in Shulgin's 1991 book [PiHKAL](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PiHKAL) ("Phenethylamines I Have Known And Loved"). Since then it has been regarded as an oddball and a novelty in the psychedelics community and is only occasionally sought after intentionally. In terms of its subjective effects, it is known for its lack of classic psychedelic visuals compared to its parent compound (mescaline) and is known instead for its unique stimulating body-high and altered headspace that ranges from euphoric to dysphoric variably.

Anecdotal reports suggest that TMA-2 is a highly unpredictable and dose-sensitive substance that can produce uncomfortable amounts of body load, nausea, overstimulation, and inconsistencies between experiences.

In modern times, TMA-2 is used as an obscure [recreational drug](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Recreational_drug_use) and a occasional [entheogen](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entheogen) . It is rarely sold on the streets and is almost exclusively obtainable as a grey area [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) through the use of online vendors.

## Chemistry

TMA-2, or 2,4,5-trimethoxyamphetamine, is a molecule of the [substituted amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Substituted_amphetamine) class. Amphetamines are substituted phenethylamines, being comprised of a phenyl ring bound to an amino (NH 2 ) group through an ethyl chain and a methyl group bound to the alpha carbon R α . TMA-2 contains methoxy functional groups CH 3 O- attached to carbons R 2 and R 4 and R 5 of the amphetamine backbone.

## Pharmacology

TMA-2's [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) effects are believed to come from its efficacy at the [5-HT2A receptor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin#The_5-HT_system) as a [partial agonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist#Agonists) . However, the role of these interactions and how they result in the [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) experience continues to remain elusive.

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)** - In terms of its effects on the physical energy levels of the user, TMA-2 is usually considered to be extremely stimulating at levels which do not become overwhelming, resulting in a shakiness and unsteadiness of the hands but encouraging one to move around, run, dance, climb and generally engage in physical activities. In comparison, other more commonly used psychedelics such as [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) are generally sedating and relaxed.
- **[Spontaneous bodily sensations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_bodily_sensations)** - The "body high" of TMA-2 is manifested as somewhat intense in comparison to most classical psychedelics such as [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) . The sensation itself can be described as a constantly present yet somewhat mild energetic pins and needles sensation that encompasses a person’s entire body. It is usually felt over every square inch of the skin, but occasionally manifests itself in the form of a continuously shifting tingling sensation that travels up and down the body in spontaneous waves.
- **[Tactile enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_enhancement)** - Feelings of enhanced tactile sensation are consistently present at moderate levels throughout most TMA-2 trips.
- **[Nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea)** - Mild to extreme nausea is reported when consumed in moderate to high dosages and either passes once the person has vomited or gradually fades by itself as the peak sets in.
- **[Vasoconstriction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction)** - This effect is usually only present at higher dosages, but can be particularly uncomfortable.
- **[Bodily control enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bodily_control_enhancement)**
- **[Pupil dilation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pupil_dilation)**
- **[Increased blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure)** ### Visual effects
 
- #### Enhancements
 
- **[Visual acuity enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_acuity_enhancement)**
- **[Colour enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_enhancement)**
- **[Pattern recognition enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition_enhancement)**
 
#### Distortions
 
- **[Drifting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting)** *( [melting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Melting) , [flowing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Flowing) , [breathing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Breathing) and [morphing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#_morphing) )* - In comparison to other psychedelics, this effect can be described as highly detailed, slow and smooth in motion, static in appearance and unrealistic/cartoon-like in style.
- **[Tracers](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tracers)**
- **[After images](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/After_images)**
- **[Symmetrical texture repetition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Symmetrical_texture_repetition)**
- **[Colour shifting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_shifting)**
- **[Diffraction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Diffraction)** ### Cognitive effects
 
- The cognitive effects of TMA-2 are described as powerful mental stimulation along with undertones of intoxication that can increase the connectivity and rate of conceptual thinking without being overwhelming. The total sum of these cognitive components regardless of the setting generally includes: 
- **[Empathy, affection, and sociability enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Empathy,_affection,_and_sociability_enhancement)** - This component is consistently manifested only in the context of social settings in which one is within the company of others. These feelings of sociability, love and empathy are weaker and sharper than those found on substances such as [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) and [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) , but still can elevate one's mood.
- **[Analysis enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Analysis_enhancement)**
- **[Thought acceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_acceleration)**
- **[Time distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Time_distortion)**
- **[Novelty enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Novelty_enhancement)**
- **[Immersion enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Immersion_enhancement)**
- **[Conceptual thinking](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Conceptual_thinking)**
- **[Thought connectivity](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_connectivity)**
- **[Emotion enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Emotion_enhancement)**
- **[Increased music appreciation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_music_appreciation)**
- **[Personal bias suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Personal_bias_suppression)**
- **[Memory suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Memory_suppression)** 
- **[Ego death](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ego_death)**
- **[Wakefulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness)**
- **[Increased libido](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_libido)** ### Auditory effects

## Toxicity and harm potential

Toxicity studies in rats have been showed TMA-2 doses of 80 mg/kg induced frequent clonic convulsions. A dose of 120 mg/kg was associated with fatal toxic effects. It was estimated that the LD50 of mice to be 180mg/kg.

The toxicity and long-term health effects of recreational TMA-2 use do not seem to have been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dose is unknown. This is because TMA-2 has very little history of human usage. Anecdotal evidence from people within the psychonaut community who have tried TMA-2 suggests that there are no negative health effects attributed to simply trying the drug by itself at low to moderate doses and using it very sparingly (but nothing can be completely guaranteed). [Independent research](https://www.google.com/) should always be done to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe before consumption.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

TMA-2 is not habit-forming and the desire to use it can actually decrease with use. It is most often self-regulating.

Tolerance to the effects of TMA-2 are built almost immediately after ingestion. After that, it takes about 3 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 7 days to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). TMA-2 presents cross-tolerance with all [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) , meaning that after the consumption of TMA-2 all psychedelics will have a reduced effect.

## Legal status

In November 2003, the European Council decided that TMA-2 shall be subjected by the Member States to control measures and criminal penalties within three months.

- **Austria** : TMA-2 is illegal to possess, produce and sell under the SMG (Suchtmittelgesetz Österreich). [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **Germany** : TMA-2 is controlled under Anlage I BtMG (Narcotics Act, Schedule I) as of October 10, 1999. It is illegal to manufacture, possess, import, export, buy, sell, procure or dispense it without a license.
- **Switzerland** : TMA-2 is a controlled substance specifically named under Verzeichnis D.
- **Turkey:** TMA-2 is a classed as drug and is illegal to possess, produce, supply, or import.
- **United Kingdom:** TMA-2 is a controlled Class A drug under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977 and is covered by the generic definition (TMA-2 is a positional isomer of the UN controlled drug TMA). [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
