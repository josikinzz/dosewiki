4-Methylphenmetrazine (mephenmetrazine, 4-MPM, PAL-747) is a recreational designer drug with stimulant effects. It is a substituted phenylmorpholine derivative, closely related to better known drugs such as phenmetrazine and 3-fluorophenmetrazine. It was first identified in Slovenia in 2015, and has been shown to act as a monoamine releaser with some preference for serotonin release.
