# 2C-H
*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2C-H*

2C-H, also known as 2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine (2,5-DMPEA) or as DMPEA-4, is a chemical compound of the phenethylamine and 2C families. It is the parent compound of the 2C drugs, which are also known as 4-substituted 2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamines.

## Use and effects

There is no record of 2C-H trials in humans, as it would likely be destroyed by monoamine oxidase enzymes before causing any significant psychoactive effects. In his book PiHKAL (Phenethylamines I Have Known and Loved), Alexander Shulgin lists both the dose and duration of 2C-H effects as unknown.

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

2C-H acts as a partial agonist of the serotonin 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, and 5-HT2C receptors, albeit with far lower potency than other 2C drugs. It also shows affinity for the serotonin 5-HT1A receptor, higher than that of any other 2C drug. The drug exhibits agonist activity in vitro at the human trace amine associated receptor 1 (TAAR1).
2C-H produces visual and auditory changes in rodents, but is much less potent than other 2C drugs. It also produces hypolocomotion at high doses similarly to other psychedelics, but failed to affect prepulse inhibition in contrast to other psychedelics. The drug shows highly potent and fully efficacious anti-inflammatory effects.

## Chemistry

### Synthesis

The chemical synthesis of 2C-H has been described. It is used as a precursor in the synthesis of other phenethylamines such as 2C-B, 2C-I, and 2C-N.

### Analogues and derivatives

2C-H (2,5-DMPEA) is one of several possible positional isomers of dimethoxyphenethylamine (DMPEA).
2C-H is the parent compound of the 2C series of psychedelic drugs, also known as 4-substituted 2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamines. These drugs include 2C-B, 2C-C, 2C-D, 2C-E, and 2C-I, among others.
The N-methyl derivative of 2C-H, N-methyl-2C-H, has reduced activational potency and efficacy at the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor compared to 2C-H.

## History

2C-H was first synthesized in 1932 by Johannes S. Buck.

## Society and culture

### Legal status

#### Canada
