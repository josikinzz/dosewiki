## Subjective Experience

I wasn’t going to include datura in this book, and I didn’t include it the first edition.
Having experienced delirium at the hands of nutmeg, I saw no sense whatsoever in
exposing myself to it again, risking my life and my mental health in the process.

Why have I changed my mind? I would argue that I haven’t. What I have decided to
do is to go through the normal routine (research, document and record), but
critically, using a minimal dose.

The idea is to more fully elaborate upon the dangers of this plant, and on deliriants in
general, whilst limiting the threat of self-harm as far as I can. This is, after all, a book
about drug safety, and on balance, given that most readers will already have heard of
it, I feel that it would be remiss not to include datura in some form.

At the outset, I think it is worth stressing again what delirium actually is. A
contributor to the DMT-Nexus forum described it in these terms:

```
“When a patient gets hallucinations from Datura alkaloids (hyoscyamine,
atropine, or scopolamine), it is a medical sign of a near fatal dose.” ~ 69ron
```
On this basis, to experience delirium or hallucinations with this it is necessary to
overdose, with risk of death. Hardly surprisingly, therefore, on sensible social media
platforms the advice of experienced people is unambiguous in stating that datura
should be avoided. This is usually expressed in stark and graphic terms.

Even Wikipedia joins the chorus:

```
“Most parts of the plants are toxic, and datura has a long history of use for
causing delirious states and death.”
```
Medical papers are awash with details of the adverse effects, which can include
seizures, hyperthermia, wide-complex dysrhythmias, cardiovascular collapse, failure
of organ systems, rhabdomyolysis, and liver, kidney and brain damage. I hope that
you are painting a picture from this.

For my own cautious experiment the question of dosage is obviously of paramount
importance. However, it quickly emerges that dose measurement is far from a
straight forward exercise. Online comments like these are not uncommon:

```
“There is no way to guess a reasonable dose, because potency of the plant
material itself and appropriate dose for an individual appear to vary so
much.” ~ Erowid
```
```
“A good dosage advise on Datura is not possible, as the alkaloid content
varies so extreme. The seeds are recognised as the part of the plant with the
least variation, but they can have anywhere from 0.1 to 0.7% tropane
alkaloids.” ~ Ginkgo, DMT-Nexus.
```
On the premise of the latter comment, one seed could have seven times the potency
of the next seed. This is a huge disparity, and it doesn't help to answer the
fundamental question with respect to my own dose, which is: how much am I
prepared to poison myself for the purpose of this experiment? The answer to this is
as little as I can get away with whilst reaching a sufficient threshold to write about it
in a credible way.

In view of the potential horror, and given the enormous dose variability, I decide to
take a single seed. On this dose, of course, I don’t anticipate delirium. However, some
form of dream potentiation during sleep is perhaps a possibility.

Regarding duration, a moderate dose is generally considered to last around 8-12
hours, with higher doses persisting for perhaps 2-3 days. Effects can apparently be
felt after an hour, give or take half an hour, with peak typically being reached at
around 4 to 6 hours.

Ready to proceed, I select a datura stramonium seed from the small plastic baggy:
one which looks relatively wholesome and alive. Aware of the potential for impaired
judgement and lost memory under its influence, I dispose of the rest.

As I prepare to take the plunge, I cannot deny that part of me is hoping that the
exercise fails, and that my supply is somehow deficient. Yes, my nutmeg experience
really was that terrifying.

T+0:00 I briefly chew the seed, breaking it with my teeth, and I swallow the
debris with a glass of water. I have started the experiment at 5:00pm so that
any effects will over-run into my sleeping hours.
```
```
T+0:45 Unexpectedly, I do feel a little something. Placebo effects can be
convincing, but there does seem to be a heady strangeness present. This is not
debilitating in any way, but it manifests largely through a tendency to linger
on thought-patterns. I am in a calm but slightly off-key space, aware of
distinct sounds and sights, but fully rational. This apparent psychoactivity
could of course have been initiated via buccal absorption whilst I chewed, in
which case I would expect it to dissipate relatively quickly.
```
```
T+2:00 The mild psychoactivity has stabilised, or perhaps I have come to
terms with it. It is there in the background, but is not really intrusive, in that I
could probably forget it if I was heavily engaged in an absorbing task. As it is
not unpleasant I would in fact like it to persist, at least for a while longer.
```
```
T+3:00 I feel quite close to base, but with a touch of headiness enduring. I
have had a bite to eat and will now embark upon some light exercise.

T+4:00 “The swim passed as standard. I find myself maybe a little more self-
reflective than usual and possibly more neutral in mood. Apart from this I
now feel normal. The self-
