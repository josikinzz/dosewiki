2C-E
 
Legal Status
 
by Erowid
 
U.S. FEDERAL LAW #
 
Caution : All legal information should be verified through other sources. [ see below ]
 
**U.S. FEDERAL LEGAL SUMMARY**
**2C-E**
- REGULATED: Yes
- STATUS: Controlled Substance
- SCHEDULE: Schedule I
 
2C-E is currently in Schedule I in the United States. This means it is illegal to manufacture, buy, possess, or distribute (sell, trade or give) without a DEA license. 
 
 In July, 2012, the US signed into Federal law a long list of new substances added to Schedule I including 4-methylmethcathinone (Mephedrone); 3,4-methylenedioxypyrovalerone (MDPV); 2-(2,5-Dimethoxy-4-ethylphenyl)ethanamine (2C-E); 2-(2,5-Dimethoxy-4-methylphenyl)ethanamine (2C-D); 2-(4-Chloro-2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)ethanamine (2C-C); 2-(4-Iodo-2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)ethanamine (2C-I); 2-[4-(Ethylthio)-2,5-dimethoxyphenyl]ethanamine (2C-T-2); 2-[4-(Isopropylthio)-2,5-dimethoxyphenyl]ethanamine (2C-T-4); 2-(2,5-Dimethoxyphenyl)ethanamine (2C-H); 2-(2,5-Dimethoxy-4-nitro-phenyl)ethanamine (2C-N); (28) 2-(2,5-Dimethoxy-4-(n)-propylphenyl)ethanamine (2C-P). 
 
 See [http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/112/s3187/text](http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/112/s3187/text) . 
 
 
There are currently [several cases](https://erowid.org/psychoactives/research_chems/research_chems_info1.shtml) pending in U.S. federal court against online vendors for selling research chemicals. These cases may address the question of whether this chemical could be legally defined as an analog of a scheduled substance. We are unaware of any cases against individuals for possession alone (7/24/04).
