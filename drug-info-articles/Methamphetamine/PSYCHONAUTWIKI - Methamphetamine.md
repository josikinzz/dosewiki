**N-Methylamphetamine** (also known as **Methamphetamine** , **Ma** , **Meth** , **Glass** , **Ice** , **Shard** , **Crank** , **Tina** , **T** , **Tweak** , **Yaba** , **Shabu** , and **Crystal** ) is a classical [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) substance of the [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) class. It is structurally related to [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) , however it crosses the blood-brain barrier more rapidly, due to its relatively high lipid solubility. It produces its effects by increasing levels of the [neurotransmitters](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurotransmitters) [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) , [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) , and [norepinephrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Norepinephrine) in the brain.

Methamphetamine was first synthesized from [ephedrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ephedrine) in 1893 by Japanese chemist Nagayoshi Nagai. Along with [heroin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Heroin) and [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) , it has a notorious reputation as a dangerous and highly addictive "street drug".

[Subjective effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effects) include [motivation enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motivation_enhancement) , [stamina enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stamina_enhancement) , [appetite suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Appetite_suppression) , [increased libido](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_libido) , and [euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Euphoria) . Chronic high-dose use can induce states of [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) & [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) , [thought disorganization](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_disorganization) , [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) , and violent behavior. It is associated with [compulsive redosing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Compulsive_redosing) , especially when it is [vaporized](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vaporized) ("smoked") or [injected](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Injected) , due to the overwhelming [euphoric](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Euphoric) rush it produces in the user upon initial administration.

Methamphetamine has been shown to have extremely high abuse and addiction potential; it is widely considered to be one of the most addictive substances due to the intense euphoria it produces. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] Additionally, unlike [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) at therapeutic doses, methamphetamine at moderate to heavy [recreational doses](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Recreational_drug_use) is considered to be directly [neurotoxic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurotoxicity) to humans, damaging both [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) and [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) [neurons](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurons) within the central nervous system. In nonhuman mammals, degeneration of monaminergic terminals and neuronal apoptosis (cell death) has been known to occur. In humans the effects are also [neurotoxic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurotoxicity) . It also displays cardiotoxicity, including [increased blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure) and elevated risk of stroke and heart attack.

It is highly advised to use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) if using this substance.

## History and culture

Amphetamine was first synthesized in 1887 in Germany by Romanian chemist Lazăr Edeleanu who named it phenylisopropylamine. Shortly after, methamphetamine was synthesized from ephedrine in 1893 by Japanese chemist Nagai Nagayoshi. Neither drug had a pharmacological use until 1934, when Smith, Kline, and French began selling amphetamine as an inhaler under the trade name Benzedrine as a decongestant. During World War II, amphetamine and methamphetamine were used extensively by both the Allied and Axis forces for their stimulant and performance-enhancing effects.

Eventually, as the addictive properties of the drugs became known, governments began to place strict controls on the sale of the drugs. For example, in 1970 in the United States, the two drugs methamphetamine and amphetamine became schedule II controlled substances under the Controlled Substances Act.

Despite strict government controls, both amphetamine and methamphetamine have still been used legally or illicitly by individuals from a variety of backgrounds for different purposes. Due to the large underground market for these drugs, they are frequently illegally synthesized by clandestine chemists, trafficked, and sold on the black market. Based upon drug and drug precursor seizures, illicit amphetamine production and trafficking is much less prevalent than that of methamphetamine. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

Methamphetamine hydrochloride is approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) under the trade name "Desoxyn". However, it is rarely prescribed due to its abuse potential, typically being reserved for cases of severe obesity or ADHD in which all other treatment options have been exhausted.

## Chemistry

Methamphetamine, or N-methylamphetamine, is a synthetic molecule of the [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) family. Molecules of the amphetamine class contain a phenethylamine core featuring a phenyl ring bound to an amino (NH2) group through an ethyl chain with an additional methyl substitution at R α . Amphetamines are alpha-methylated phenethylamines. Methamphetamine contains an additional methyl substitution at R N , a substitution which is shared with [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) , [methcathinone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methcathinone) , and [mephedrone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mephedrone) .

### Stereoisomers

Methamphetamine exists as two [enantiomers](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Enantiomers) : dextrorotary and levorotary. Dextrorotatory or dextromethamphetamine (also known as d-methamphetamine) is a stronger central nervous system (CNS) stimulant than levomethamphetamine; however, both are considered to be dependence-forming and addictive when misused and capable of producing similar toxicity symptoms at heavy recreational doses. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

## Pharmacology

Methamphetamine primarily affects the central nervous system (CNS) by acting as a [releasing agent](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Releasing_agent) for [neurotransmitters](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurotransmitters) such as [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) , [norepinephrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Norepinephrine) , and [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) . It also acts as a [reuptake inhibitor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Reuptake_inhibitor) for some transporter neurons, thereby holding neurotransmitters like norepinephrine in the synapse. Meth also acts as reverse transporter for some transporter neurons, increasing levels of monoamines by forcing the neurotransmitters out of their storage vesicles and expelling them into the synaptic gap by making the dopamine transporters work in reverse. Other mechanisms by which methamphetamine are known to increase monoamine levels are by:

- Decreasing the expression of dopamine transporters at the cell surface, which has the same effect as listed above.
- Increasing cytosolic levels of monoamines by inhibiting the activity of [monoamine oxidase](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MAOI) (MAO)
- Increasing the activity and expression of the [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) -synthesizing enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)

In addition to releasing potent amounts of monoamines, Methamphetamine has a high lipid solubility which leads to a relatively fast transfer of the drug across the blood-brain barrier and a quick onset in comparison to other [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) . All of this results in feelings of reward, euphoria, and stimulation as well as an unpleasant offset.

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)** - In terms of its effects on the physical energy levels of the user, methamphetamine is usually considered to be extremely energetic and stimulating in a fashion that is identical to that of [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) , but stronger than that of [modafinil](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Modafinil) , [caffeine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Caffeine) , and [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) . It is similar yet distinct from the stimulation experienced on [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) , encouraging physical activities such as dancing, socializing, running, or cleaning. The particular style of stimulation which methamphetamine presents can be described as forced. This means that at higher dosages, it becomes difficult or impossible to keep still as jaw clenching, involuntarily bodily shakes and vibrations become present, resulting in extreme shaking of the entire body, unsteadiness of the hands, and a general lack of motor control. 
- **[Physical euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria)** - As a potent stimulant, methamphetamine is capable producing states of intense physical euphoria, especially when it is [vaporized](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vaporized) or [injected](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Injected) . However, the initial rush of euphoria can wear off well before the substance has run its course which can promote compulsive redosing, which can have extremely damaging cumulative effects.
- **[Abnormal heartbeat](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Abnormal_heartbeat)**
- **[Increased blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure)**
- **[Increased heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate)**
- **[Appetite suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Appetite_suppression)**
- **[Body odor alteration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Body_odor_alteration)** - Methamphetamine can potentially leave a very distinct odor within one's urine, sweat and general bodily secretions. Most people would consider it as unpleasant, but few people do enjoy it and find it a very pleasant odor.
- **[Bronchodilation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bronchodilation)**
- **[Dehydration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dehydration)**
- **[Frequent urination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Frequent_urination)**
- **[Increased bodily temperature](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_bodily_temperature)**
- **[Increased perspiration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_perspiration)**
- **[Muscle contractions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_contractions)**
- **[Muscle spasms](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_spasms)**
- **[Neurotoxicity](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurotoxicity)** -- from long-term use.
- **[Stamina enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stamina_enhancement)** - This effect is more prominent than with any other commonly used [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) .
- **[Tactile enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_enhancement)**
- **[Tactile hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_hallucination)** - High doses and/or prolonged usage of certain stimulants like methamphetamine and [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) can lead to hallucinatory sensations of bugs crawling on the surface of or underneath one’s skin. This is typically referred to as *delusional parasitosis* or more informally as “meth mites”.
- **[Teeth grinding](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Teeth_grinding)**
- **[Temporary erectile dysfunction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Temporary_erectile_dysfunction)**
- **[Vasoconstriction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction)**
- **[Pupil dilation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pupil_dilation)**
- **[Vibrating vision](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vibrating_vision)** - At high doses or certain routes of administration, a person's eyeballs may begin to spontaneously wiggle back and forth in a rapid motion, causing the vision to become blurry and temporarily out of focus. This is a condition known as [nystagmus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nystagmus) .
- **[Seizure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizure)** - This is an uncommon effect but can happen in those predisposed to them, especially while in physically taxing conditions such as being dehydrated, fatigued or undernourished, or if miusing the substance for extended periods of time. ### Visual effects
 
- The visual effects of methamphetamine are usually less consistent and are only mildly noticeable at higher dosages. They are somewhat comparable to the visuals produced by [deliriants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Deliriants) and are more frequent in darker areas. Scenarios consisting of severe sleep deprivation caused by [wakefulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness) can lead to more intense visual effects and even [hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/External_hallucinations) . 
#### Suppressions
 
- **[Double vision](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Double_vision)**
 
#### Distortions
 
- **[Visual drifting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_drifting)** - This effect is usually subtle or barely noticeable and only occurs at higher dosages or when combined with [cannabis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cannabis) . It is most prominent when smoked or taken intravenously and is usually [delirious](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Deliriants) in nature. Commonly this, high dosages or prolonged use can cause level 1-2 visual drifting.
- **[Brightness alteration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Brightness_alteration)**
 
#### Hallucinatory states
 
- **[Transformations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Transformations)** - This effect occurs very rarely, and typically only when the user has taken high doses, is coming down, or has been awake for unusually long periods. They are usually very mild when they do happen to occur. ### Cognitive effects
 
- The cognitive effects of methamphetamine can be broken down into several components which progressively intensify proportional to dosage. The general head space of methamphetamine is described by many as one of extreme mental [stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation) , [increased focus](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Focus_enhancement) , [ego inflation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ego_inflation) and powerful euphoria. It contains a large number of typical [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) cognitive effects. Although negative side effects are usually mild at low to moderate dosages, they become increasingly likely to manifest themselves with higher amounts or widespread usage. This particularly holds true during the offset of the experience. The most prominent of these cognitive effects generally include: 
- **[Analysis enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Analysis_enhancement)**
- **[Compulsive redosing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Compulsive_redosing)**
- **[Ego inflation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ego_inflation)**
- **[Cognitive euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_euphoria)** - This effect is often very intense when compared to other dopaminergic stimulants such as [Amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) or even [Cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine)
- **[Empathy, affection and sociability enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Empathy,_affection_and_sociability_enhancement)** - This effect is mild to moderate and usually disappears within the first few uses or after any form of tolerance has developed.
- **[Focus enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Focus_enhancement)** - This component is most effective at low to moderate dosages as anything higher will usually impair concentration.
- **[Immersion enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Immersion_enhancement)**
- **[Increased libido](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_libido)**
- **[Increased music appreciation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_music_appreciation)**
- **[Memory enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Memory_enhancement)**
- **[Motivation enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motivation_enhancement)**
- **[Thought acceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_acceleration)**
- **[Thought organization](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_organization)**
- **[Time compression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Time_distortion)** - This can be described as the experience of time speeding up and passing much quicker than it usually would when sober.
- **[Wakefulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness)** ### After effects
 
- The effects which occur during the [offset](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Offset) of a [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) experience generally feel negative and uncomfortable in comparison to the effects which occurred during its [peak](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Peak) . This is often referred to as a "comedown" and occurs because of [neurotransmitter](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurotransmitter) depletion. Its effects commonly include: 
- **[Anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety)**
- **[Appetite suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Appetite_suppression)**
- **[Cognitive fatigue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_fatigue)**
- **[Depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depression)**
- **[Irritability](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Irritability)**
- **[Motivation suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motivation_suppression)**
- **[Sleep paralysis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sleep_paralysis)** - Some users note sleep paralysis after consuming methamphetamine.
- **[Suicidal ideation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Suicidal_ideation)**
- **[Thought deceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_deceleration)**
- **[Psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis)**
- **[Wakefulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness)** - This particular after effect is more pronounced than it is with any other commonly used [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) .

## Toxicity and harm potential

### Neurotoxicity

There is evidence that methamphetamine causes brain damage from long-term use in humans; this damage includes adverse changes in brain structure and function, such as reductions in gray matter volume in several brain regions and adverse changes in markers of metabolic integrity.

Unlike [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) , methamphetamine is directly neurotoxic to [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) neurons. Moreover, methamphetamine abuse is associated with an increased risk of Parkinson's disease due to excessive pre-synaptic dopamine autoxidation, a mechanism of neurotoxicity. Similar to the neurotoxic effects on the dopamine system, methamphetamine can also result in neurotoxicity to [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) [neurons](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurons) . It has been demonstrated that a high core temperature is correlated with an increase in the neurotoxic effects of methamphetamine. As a result of methamphetamine-induced neurotoxicity to dopamine neurons, chronic use may also lead to post acute withdrawals which persist beyond the withdrawal period for months, and even up to a year.

### Dependence and abuse potential

As with other [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) , the chronic use of methamphetamine can be considered extremely addictive with a high potential for abuse and is capable of causing psychological dependence among certain users. When addiction has developed, cravings and [withdrawal effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Withdrawal_effects) may occur if a person suddenly stops their usage.

Tolerance to the effects of methamphetamine rapidly develops with prolonged and repeated use. This results in users having to administer increasingly large doses to achieve the same effects. After that, it takes about 3 - 7 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 1 - 2 weeks to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). Methamphetamine presents cross-tolerance with all [dopaminergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) , meaning that after the consumption of methamphetamine all [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) will have a reduced effect.

The evidence on effective treatments for [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) and methamphetamine dependence and abuse is limited. In light of this, [fluoxetine](/w/index.php?title=Fluoxetine&action=edit&redlink=1) and [imipramine](/w/index.php?title=Imipramine&action=edit&redlink=1) appear to have some limited benefits in treating abuse and addiction, "no treatment has been demonstrated to be effective for the treatment of methamphetamine dependence and abuse".

In highly dependent [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) and methamphetamine abusers, "when chronic heavy users abruptly discontinue methamphetamine use, many report a time-limited withdrawal syndrome that occurs within 24 hours of their last dose". Withdrawal symptoms in chronic, high-dose users are frequent, occurring in up to 87.6% of cases, and persist for three to four weeks with a marked "crash" phase occurring during the first week. Methamphetamine withdrawal symptoms can include anxiety, drug craving, dysphoric mood, fatigue, increased appetite, increased movement or decreased movement, lack of motivation, sleeplessness or sleepiness, and vivid or lucid dreams. Withdrawal symptoms are associated with the degree of dependence (i.e., the extent of abuse). The mental depression associated with methamphetamine withdrawal lasts longer and is more severe than that of [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) withdrawal.

Although it is clear that vaporised methamphetamine is more addictive than oral or insufflated amphetamine, there is debate as to whether the drug itself is inherently more addictive, and if so, how important the difference is. Besides the duration of action, the main difference between the two drugs is that methamphetamine is proportionally more centrally and less peripherally active. One reason is because the increased lipid solubility of the methyl group causes faster central absorption. Another cause is the fact that methamphetamine releases proportionally more dopamine at an equivalent dose. D-methamphetamine releases a dopamine:norepinephrine ratio of ~1:1.3 from synapses versus ~1:2 for d-amphetamine. Their effect on the norepinephrine (NET) and dopamine (DAT) transporters are more alike but there is a slight difference. D-methamphetamine favours NET by a factor of about 4 vs 5 for d-amphetamine. D-methamphetamine is also slightly more serotonergic. This may be a negligible difference, as the ratio of serotonin:norepinephrine release is only 1:60 for d-methamphetamine and 1:80 for d-amphetamine. Neither drug has any appreciable affinity for the serotonin transporter (SERT).

This increased central vs peripheral effect of methamphetamine agrees with the common subjective feeling among stimulant users that the methamphetamine high has less of an inherently 'jittery' quality to it. The downside is that this aversive effect may be helpful as it discourages harmful levels of use. It is unclear what real world impact this difference has. A double-blind but small study of 13 methamphetamine users revealed only a minor preference towards methamphetamine, and this may be explained by the users having a greater familiarity with the drug.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this substance.

### Psychosis

Abuse of methamphetamine can result in a stimulant psychosis that may present with a variety of symptoms (e.g., [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/External_hallucinations) , [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) ). A review on treatment for [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) , [dextroamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dextroamphetamine) , and methamphetamine abuse-induced psychosis states that about 5–15% of users fail to recover completely. The same review asserts that, based upon at least one trial, [antipsychotic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antipsychotic) medications effectively resolve the symptoms of acute amphetamine psychosis. Psychosis very rarely arises from therapeutic use.

### Overdose

A methamphetamine overdose may result in a wide range of symptoms and is potentially fatal at heavy dosages. A moderate overdose of methamphetamine may induce symptoms such as abnormal heart rhythm, confusion, dysuria, high or low blood pressure, hyperthermia, hyperreflexia, myalgia, severe agitation, tachypnea, tremor, urinary hesitancy, and urinary retention. An extremely large overdose may produce symptoms such as adrenergic storm, methamphetamine psychosis, anuria, cardiogenic shock, cerebral hemorrhage, circulatory collapse, hyperpyrexia, pulmonary hypertension, renal failure, rhabdomyolysis, [serotonin syndrome](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome) , and a form of stereotypy ("tweaking"). A methamphetamine overdose will likely also result in mild brain damage due to dopaminergic and serotonergic neurotoxicity. Death from fatal methamphetamine poisoning is typically preceded by convulsions and coma.

#### Emergency treatment

Acute methamphetamine overdose is largely managed by treating the symptoms, and administration of [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine) relieves symptoms such as agitation, hypertension, tachycardia, and seizure.

### Harm reduction

Studies have shown that [N-acetylcysteine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/N-acetylcysteine) (NAC) can block the harmful neurotoxic effects of methamphetamine while preventing neurotransmitter depletion in rats and clinical trials in humans to treat methamphetamine dependence are currently underway. NAC may be effective for reducing the cravings and psychological dependence as well. NAC has a short half life and a sustained release formulation may be preferred for harm reduction purposes. Selenium has also been shown to protect the brain against meth induced neurotoxicity. However, it is worth noting that this data is preliminary and may not be applicable to humans.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **Alcohol** - Drinking alcohol on stimulants is considered risky because it reduces the sedative effects of the alcohol that the body uses to gauge drunkenness. This often leads to excessive drinking with greatly reduced inhibitions, increasing the risk of liver damage and increased dehydration. The effects of stimulants will also allow one to drink past a point where they might normally pass out, increasing the risk. If you do decide to do this then you should set a limit of how much you will drink each hour and stick to it, bearing in mind that you will feel the alcohol and the stimulant less.
- **GHB** / **GBL** - Stimulants increase respiration rate allowing a higher dose of sedatives. If the stimulant wears off first then the depressant effects of the GHB/GBL may overcome the user and cause respiratory arrest.
- **Opioids** - Stimulants increase respiration rate allowing a higher dose of opiates. If the stimulant wears off first then the opiate may overcome the patient and cause respiratory arrest.
- **Cocaine** - The rewarding effects of cocaine are mediated by DAT inhibition, and an increase of exocytosis of dopamine through the cell membrane. Amphetamine reverses the direction of DAT and the direction vesicular transports within the cell by a pH mediated mechanism of displacement, thus excludes the regular mechanism of dopamine release through means of exocytosis because the effects Na+/K+ ATPase are inhibited. You will find cardiac effects with the combination of cocaine and amphetamine due to a SERT mediated mechanism from the subsequent activation of 5-HT2B, which is an effect of serotonin-related valvulopathy. Amphetamines generally cause hypertension in models of abuse, and this combination can increase the chances of syncope due to turbulent blood flow during valve operation. The rewarding mechanisms of cocaine are reversed by administration of amphetamine.
- **Cannabis** - Stimulants increase [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) levels and the risk of [thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops) and [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) which can lead to negative experiences.
- **Caffeine** - This combination of stimulants is generally considered unnecessary and may increase strain on the heart, as well as potentially causing anxiety and physical discomfort.
- **Tramadol** - Tramadol and stimulants both increase the risk of seizures.
- **DXM** - Both substances raise heart rate, in extreme cases, panic attacks caused by these substances have led to more serious heart issues.
- **Ketamine** - Combining amphetamine and ketamine may result in psychoses that resemble schizophrenia, but not worse than the psychoses produced by either substance alone, but this is debatable. This is due to amphetamines ability to attenuated the disruption of working memory caused by ketamine. Amphetamine alone may result in grandiosity, paranoia, or somatic delusions with little to no effect on negative symptoms. Ketamine, however, will result in thought disorders, disruption of executive functioning, and delusions due to a modification of conception. These mechanisms are due to an increase of dopaminergic activity in the mesolimbic pathway caused by amphetamine due to its pharmacology effecting dopamine, and due to a disruption of dopaminergic functioning in the mesocortical pathways via NMDA antagonism effects of ketamine. Combining the two, you may expect mainly thought disorder along with positive symptoms.
- **PCP** - Increases risk of tachycardia, hypertension, and manic states.
- **Methoxetamine** - Increases risk of tachycardia, hypertension, and manic states.
- **Psychedelics** (e.g. ***[LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) , [mescaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mescaline) , [psilocybin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocybin)*** ) - Increases risk of [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , and [thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops) . 
- **25x-NBOMe** - Amphetamines and NBOMes both provide considerable stimulation that when combined they can result in tachycardia, hypertension, vasoconstriction and, in extreme cases, heart failure. The anxiogenic and focusing effects of stimulants are also not good in combination with psychedelics as they can lead to unpleasant thought loops. NBOMes are known to cause seizures and stimulants can increase this risk.
- **2C-T-x** - Suspected of mild MAOI properties. May increase the risk of hypertensive crisis.
- **5-MeO-xxT** - Suspected of mild MAOI properties. May increase the risk of hypertensive crisis.
- **DOx**
- **aMT** - aMT has MAOI properties which may interact unfavorably with amphetamines.
- **MAOIs** - MAO-B inhibitors can increase the potency and duration of phenethylamines unpredictably. MAO-A inhibitors with amphetamine can lead to hypertensive crises.

## Legal status

The production, distribution, sale, and possession of methamphetamine is restricted or illegal in many jurisdictions. Methamphetamine has been placed in Schedule II of the United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances treaty.

- **Australia** : Methamphetamine is placed under Schedule 8, meaning that it is available for medical use, but possession, production or supply of it is illegal without authority.
