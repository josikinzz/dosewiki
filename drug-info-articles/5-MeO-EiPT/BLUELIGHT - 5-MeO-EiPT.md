Wondering If anyone has tried this one?Search extensively but only thing I've found was that it was quite sedating , not great on its own but decent in combination with certain things (salvia was the combo being discussed) , but nothing as far as dosage.


Have read the tihkal entry for EIPT , which makes it sound undesirable but like I said barely any info on the 5-meo version. 


Was going to bump the 1 thread i found on here but was archive so decided to make a new one with the hopes that someone around here has some info.

It is indeed in TIHKAL and I have reported it to be active in the 4-6 milligram range, orally. And the same compound with one additional carbon atom, the N,N-diisopropyl homologue, is also an old friend which I had named 5-MeO-DIPT. In TIHKAL its dose is suggested to be in the 6-12 milligram range. But the N-ethyl is half-way between those two compounds and I never did get around to making it.

I have been caught more than once with the easy logic of, "Since this is half way between A and B as to structure, it will probably be half way between them in potency as well." Every new compound is a unique entity and must be approached as the total unknown that it is. Start small. Give time between trials. And in something that is publicly available, learn everything you can from other explorers.

Well looks like I'll be the lab rat for this one.


Will allergy test a speckle and likely start with a very small (possible sub threshold dose) 2-3mg dose. 


The only 5-meo I've had is the MIPT. Ive tested that from 5-17ish mg. my desired dose is in the 5-7mg range which provides a great aphrodisiac effect with very enhanced tactile with very little pyscedelia until I get over 10mg. Personally don't find it's pysedelic effects very rewarding and would much rather go with a 4-sub trypt if that's what I'm looking for.


Given that I'm gonna try and be as safe as possible and start extremely low in case this stuff is as potent as 5-meo-mipt.


Will report back Findings after testing.

Roa will be oral in gelcap but willing to reconsider. Am fairly new to the world of RC's and have not done any volumetric dosing. Seems easy enough and I'll read up on it tonight before I decide what I'm going to do.


I have a milligram scale but not one nearly as accurate for <5mg dose.


I weigh gel cap , add compound and re weigh. I think this is best way to get accurate dose outside of volumetric dosing.


Plan was weigh out 5-6mg. Split as evenly as possible into 3 portions. Take a "speckle" of one of the [roughly] 2mg piles as allergy test.... 


I will reconsider how to proceed though thanks for posting. Earliest I'd be dosing would be tonight (5-6 hours from now but more likely wait until tomorrow)

[Here is the volumetric measurement thread](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/showthread.php?t=286239) ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


It is indeed very very easy and it has the benefit of not only giving more control and thus safety, but also that you can have more faith in the doses you choose and measure, so that you yourself and others can properly use that information without having to keep using guesswork and error margins.


Not sure how much you have at your disposal but you could weigh out about 15 mg and measure a quantity of water so that even 0.5 or 0.1 mg differences can be known. The question is: do you have anything that lends itself for measuring? Something that comes as close to possible as this: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graduated_cylinder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graduated_cylinder). Syringes are obviously great...

If you have another scale that can weigh heavier things you can also weigh water to measure doses.


You can be creative with other things as well like using a long-drink glass and taping paper to it that has lines on it. Walk around where you live to see if you see anything that you could use. You can calculate how far apart the lines are supposed to be and they don't even have to be real milliliters, as long as you can see 15 'units' for 15 mg (for example)!


And it would be awesome if you keep a log of effects that you can use to write a report at a later moment when you feel like it. Just use keywords, that it doesn' t have to get in the way of experiencing and exploring the effects.


Of course all of this is optional, what is important is just that you feel alright when you do this and have a nice and interesting time. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

Great thanks for the link. Nothing around the house but I suspect a oral syringe , used for babies would likely do the trick and could be found at the local pharmacy. 


Think I'll likely hold off and browse that thread and pic up a syringe tomorrow , that way I can provide more of a scientific approach with dosing.


Plenty of material to work with. If I have any questions after reading the thread you posted I'll ask there.


& yeah I planned to log (likely in this thread if that's fine) some basic thoughts after each test and will ultimately write a trip report when I reach what I feel is an active dose.

Yeah I'm still

Around just haven't gotten to it yet. To many other better researched things to try at the moment.


Only info I found was an old post , perhaps on this forum stating it was fairly sedating & not great by itself but mixed well with Sally (assume that's salvia)


Another report , who I think is working with the same batch as me said 15mg proved to me very mild and uneventful . Slight tracers & a case of the giggles.


I figured dosage would be much lower consider 5-meo-mipt&dipt low threshold doses.


Ill still allergen test then start at 1-2mg , hopefully in the next coming weeks.

I bought some of that stuff in that period after the first internet RC vendor was raided a bit before 911,while the store was still open and in a limbo, anybody my age around here surely knows what place I'm speaking of...I actually sold 90% of it and I hardly remember how it was, this post reminded me it was ever available hah.

eating/drinking is better than snuffing for sure. the trade off is more effect for anxiety/unease and mild nausea, go fig.


moxy doses can be pushed pretty high, so I figure eoto can get pushed pretty high as well. not sure from first hand though, with eoto that is, I know that moxy can get pushed from multiple trials. dose/roa change everything with moxy, so its likely the same with eoto.

Just became available to me, I'm sure you guys know the vendor, and reports IV it's activity without comparing it to its homologous? I've never tasted EiPT so I don't think a comparison would be relevant.

Just tried the EOTO chemical the other night however there was some heavy drinking prior to consumption. Smoked lots of weed and forgot that the pill was consumed. At 7 milligrams there definately was noticed an odd feeling similar to mushrooms and it felt like there was some increased tactile. Noticed a slight headache that also could have been caused by the alcohol and there was alot of paranoia about taking a substance with no info about it. Defiately noticed some fucked up kinda relaxed giggly feel similar to the effect reached with low dose mushrooms or LSD. However trying to turn the wierd body sensations into something enjoyable proved somewhat difficult. Girlfriend was also mad at the fact that drugs were consumed and there was an uneasy vibe in the atmosphere. Was hoping that it would get better but it just ended up feeling hungover until bedtime. The next day felt fine and no hangover. 


Was worried that sleep would be difficult however within 3 hours after consumption sleep was reached. 


Wondering if a high enough dose was consumed. In the future there will be more detailed experiment conducted possibly the next one being a smoked trial. 


In comparing an experience with a low dose Mipt version it should be noted that the Mipt was much more enjoyable for swim even though some people have reported it to be also be kinda weird and not molly like. Another friend reported that the Mipt was suprisingly enlightening. Further comparisons with eoto will follow!!!

**5 meo Mipt**


Somebody else out there has to have some. Where are the rest of the reports? We need to compare it to 5 meo Mipt and DIpt.

I have tried this up to 15mg...not pushy like dipt or as speedy as mipt....it is somewhat sedating and stoning.  Great headspace and nice bodyload, trying to do thangs is more difficult then doing them sober.

Sounds like I might like it! Any more first hand experience on this? I think if people actually sampled it and report on it, we can make this a central thread.

Really! I was hoping it wouldn't be dysphoric like was reported with EiPT.

It seems really strange that a compound so closely resembling 5-MeO-DiPT, 5-MeO-DET and 5-MeO-MiPT would be consistently dysphoric. I can believe that about a very atypical compound like salvinorin A, but with something like these tryptamines I would be tempted to attribute it to:

- idiosyncratic reactions

- set & setting

- a panic/terror reaction inherent to something qualitatively overwhelming like 5-MeO-DMT

I was talking about actual EiPT, one of the side effects noted by Shulgin tended to be dysphoria, though I do tend to abbreviate in some posts.

Oh sorry, then the comparison to 5-MeO's doesn't make sense - but it doesn't change that much about the point I tried to make.


Then again, I found MiPT very weird and not particularly enjoyable.

How so? Obviously the comparison wouldn't be major but anyone whos tried say DiPT can tell you its 5-MeO-DiPT has some DiPT like qualities, their just of a different flavor. It does not change the point your trying to make but it was the Shulgin's assay, not some online user, they usually at least test the compounds a few times before calling them duds,especially the active ones. Would love to try MiPT but I doubt there's much other way to describe DiPT trips as "weird".

At 2:05 pm caspule containing 4-7 miligrams of 5 meo EiPT was consumed. 


A light meal of pizza was eaten an hour prior to the experiment. 


Very little experience with the Mipt cousin aside from one other time that seemed very enjoyable but on the threshhold side of things. 


took a shower and feel some of the effects. theres something but it feels very weak so


another capsule is taken at 2:45 pm


3:00 pm feeling stretchy and kinda shaky maybe at about a +


Drank a cup of earl grey tea. Hopefully a little caffene combines well. 


3:10 pm feeling gassy maybe like I have to take a shit.


Putting on some Amon Tobin mix.


3:15 doesnt feel that intense if anything. Music doesnt have too much of a differnece or sound that interesting until something really good is played. About to smoke some weed to see what happens.


3:30 pm Stoned yet feel very nervous and uneasy. Still coming up definately. 

 Dont feel as good as it should and not enjoying or feeling comforable with any of the music chosen. Peace and quiet is definately too boring though. 

 Really feel like doing something but immediatly get spaced out and scatter brained. The physical feeling is very weird 


Layed down and it feels good. Run fingers through hair and feel relaxed but immediately feeling uneasyness still in upper torso. 


Still not enjoying music as much as swim would like to be. Feel stress in neck and torso and any release of tension feels great. Feels almost like a buzzing in the head that is uncomfortable. 


4:00 pm 

still feel quite shitty about music and the whole experience until a decision to look at some porn and try to see if theres any effect. At the very idea swim becomes aroused. Upon watching climax was reached a little too quickly. In fact with no effort at all. Quite premature to say the least and very glad a female was not present to witness such a failure. 


Although the experience did seem heightend immensly. Very sexual and almost desperate in a way. Also cravings for food are all there. Food tastes delicious. 


THis drug seems like something that just potentiates cravings for more dopamine while enhancing the feeling of the dopamine when you get it. 


OTher than when your consuming something or having sex the drug makes it hard to relax 


4:15 

I notice alot of tension in my neck that really could use some TLC. If there were a girl here swim would very much so be desperately messaging eachother in a very fiendish way that would lead to sex most definately. SImilar in a way to how some feel on MDMA.


4:20 smoking weed feeling very shaky and hungry


watch more porn and again reach climax way too easily


4:50 smoke more weed 


throguhout the whole trip it is noticed a fried kinda feeling in the back of the head. constantly cant decide wether swim is hungry or full or horny or satisfied. The whole experience so far seems interesting if that. Not at all euphoric or a happy direction. Kind of annoying and wish it would stop putting pressure on my head. 


5:05 starting to finally relax and feel good with no music on and just listening to the sounds of the world. 


5:15 still notice a feeling of a light headache.  Kinda feel like shit.

Feel better when swim goes outside. Have been just sitting around trying to gauge the effects. And  although feeling shitty swim feels like if swim should be doing something more social and active on it maybe it would feel better.  


feels like swim wants to lay down but when laying down gets bored. When siting up it still feels shitty. dont really want to talk to anybody and feels akward. head definately still hurts and when smoking weed it  gets worse


6:15 

Feeling pretty good and theres definately a good body high going on but swim chooses to ignore it because the head still feels so strange. Its like gentle pressure around the skull and back of the neck. A feeling of being at peace with the world and contentness similar to the end of a mushroom experience and very different from the earlier parts of the trip where it was hard to get comfortable. Sexual feelings are definately still heightened in a way similar to the end of a mushroom trip. The idea of sex is very arousing. 


6:30 Feel good and very calm almost euphoric and kind of cuddly.  Definately fucked up alright and movement is very relaxed. The drug seems like it would show more character in a social setting however right now it feels kind of akward and spacey. Feels alive in that mushroom kind of way. The beginning just felt so wierd and unenjoyable. Head still has some wierd sensations that swim doesnt find comfortable. And it still has that vague feeling of a headache. 


6:52 pm

Still feeling the effects however if swim could sum up the whole trip in few words it would be sick, horny, hungry, anxious, fiendish, insatiable, relaxed. Eating food is very similar to the munchies. The way swim wants sex is also like the munchies. Very insatiable. Orgasm comes very easily even after 4 times. The way sex and food is enjoyed is the most interesting.  Still dont know how it would compare to Mipt in that way yet. 


7:04pm

The feeling of pressure like a headache is still present does anyone else notice this with the mipt or dipt versions as well as other tryptamines? On the comedown the headache is definately easing off into a more subtle feeling. Its like swims head has been buzzing in an uncomfotable way where he couldnt relax fully and it made him feel kind of fried. Now that he can relax he still feels a little fuckd with.


Swim doesnt get this head pressure feeling ever for this long when eating mushrooms or LSD that is for sure. 


Swim doesnt think he wants to repeat the 5 meo Eipt again because it was definately hard to enjoy. Maybe with practice and yoga and the right set setting somebody can find use for this one. For him it is doubtful he will want to try it again unless somebody else says otherwise. 


Swim would still like to experiment further with the 5 meo MIPT because there has not been enough research. The last time swim took it he thought it was quite enjoyable. With similar doses of the EiPT he found not so much as enjoyable however so far the effects are very similar. 


8:15 

The end is very very relaxed. No headache leftover and no other bad feelings. Just really really relaxed and kinda horny.

Just cross-posting my TR on this substance.

[http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/...hoxetamine)-Experienced-GOLD!-I-VE-FOUND-GOLD](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/697298-%2810mg-5-MeO-EiPT-30mg-Methoxetamine%29-Experienced-GOLD!-I-VE-FOUND-GOLD)!


I really am blown away, I enjoyed 5-MEO-DMT/MiPT but EiPT was really in another league of amazing visuals, the body high, for me it's the most enjoyable 5-meo subbed trypt that I've tried (Have not tried the DiPT, MET, DPT versions though)

You can't really say that said report is a report on this substance - you barely gave it any time to do anything before you tainted it with MXE. And why you would IM something that is virtually unknown is totally lost on me. Talk about irresponsible.


I don't hold high hopes for this one to be honest. You certainly wouldn't see me trying it. It is too close to 5-MeO-DiPT for comfort. Even the few reports are reminiscent of the heavy bodyload 5-MeO-DiPT is known for although I haven't heard about explosive diarrhea yet. ![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif) I would think this will have a steep dose/response curve like 5-MeO-DiPT and 5-MeO-MiPT. I enjoy 5-MeO-MiPT other than the speedy bodyload but 5-MeO-DiPT will make you lose your mind with just a few milligrams off from a dose that took you to a nice +++ in the past.


Be very cautious with this one.

I IM all psychedelics and all my experiences are with MXE mixed in, I didn't want to push it any higher and so I supplemented with my usual mixer. Sorry I didn't adhere to your personal standards of testing but it seemed like a good idea to get any information I personally have on it out there as this substance is available now. Personally, I feel I did give it enough time, that's the entire reason why I IM, so I can take small doses incrementally and really get a feel for what said dose is going to do quickly as well as I have severe GI issues and extremely dislike eating any psychedelics. 


I would agree with a steep dose/response, I don't know of any 5-MeO out there without one.

The report is appreciated, it just can't be considered a report on 5-MeO-EiPT alone.


In regards to the dose/response curve, 5-MeO-DiPT has the steepest I've ever seen. The psychosis from a few milligrams difference... *shudder*


Hopefully 5-MeO-EiPT is closer to 5-MeO-MiPT when it comes to the dose/response curve because the last thing the world needs is another chem like 5-MeO-DiPT.

The psychosis manifested very PCP like.


Here's one such example... A very experienced subject no less.


[http://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=27587](http://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=27587)


The stuff is notoriously toxic at high doses:

[http://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=6140](http://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=6140)

[http://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=19339](http://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=19339) (this was a retarded report but still)


Those are just a few...


Some liken 5-MeO-DiPT (when it goes horribly wrong) to be what like tripping in hell would be like.

Any more info on this? I attempted to vape a couple of mg but seemed to burn most of it, slight tryptamine tingles but nothing exciting. I'll be taking around 8 mg orally in the near future.

Anyway, tried 9 mg of this yesterday, it's a gem. Very pleasant, albeit intense, body load, incredibly clear mental high, and gentle enough visuals. There was little in the way of alteration of lights, similar to DMT or other 5-subbed tryptamines. Did take a while for effects to kick in, around 3 hours, perhaps due to recent consumption of a heavy meal, but there was little nausea on the comeup, something I frequently experience, and it lasted for a nice while, about 10 hours before visuals subsided. I couldn't sleep for around 16 hours, although sleep never comes easy after psychedelics for me, and feel relatively rested today, despite being poorly rested. I have no body tension today, nor yesterday.

still pretty curious, keep the posts coming even if the psychedelic I really want to have, well there's 2 of them, are DiPT and DPT, nobody seems to have those available  anymore these days that I have money and not just a freshman in college ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png) As a musician DiPT seems hilarious.

Never done 5-meo-eipt but with 5-meo-mipt oral dosage was hands down the best ROA.

When insufflated I found that it became very stimulating and hardly psychedelic. Very uncomfortable compared to oral dosage

5-meo-eipt is very closely related to 5-meo-dipt, I doubt it would be better since I've heard so little on it.

Foxy is generally considered to be the most enjoyable out of the 5-meo-(x)ipt drugs

Well, deliver the goods and tell us more!


Of the related 5-MeO-MiPT...it is very different when smoked.  That is also true of N,N-DiPT.  I've never eaten 5-MeO-MiPT, but I have smoked a lot and there is no stimulation or any of the (what sounds like) annoying side effects.  THis was noted by Shulgin..


"The last two entries in the "Qualitative Comments" section are longer than usual, but even at that they have been trimmed down from reports sent to me that were each of over three pages in length. A thread common to each of them, is the comparison of the effects of smoking 5-MeO-MIPT to those from smoking 5-MeO-DMT. The speed of onset, the intense depersonalization and loss of immediate contact with one's surroundings, the impressive recall of early memories and the significance of these memories, make the drugs appear similar to one another......All you need to do, to see that clearly, is to look at that one additional observation involving oral activity. This drug, 5-MeO-MIPT, is several times more potent when taken orally than it is when smoked. ...What a rich area for speculation. Preferential metabolism? First pass goings-on? Chemical change from pyrolysis in the pipe? Different receptors? Lipophilicity? I am reminded of the quote from Mark Twain; "I like science because it gives one such a wholesome return of conjecture from such a trifling investment of fact."

Most people seem to dislike the adrenergic tenseness of the body buzz from 5-meo-dipt. I haven't met anyone who hasn't rated 5-meo-mipt higher if they tried it.

Excerpt from a TR I submitted to erowid for 9 mg oral. My experiences with smoking are limited to it doesn't work very well and tastes like shit and burns easily. 


"In brief this drug had a startling long comeup – future experiences will clarify if the recent food was the culprit in this case, an incredibly intense yet pleasurable body load, little to no nausea, gentle visuals with little alteration of lights, and an exceptionally clear mental headspace convoluted only by distracting stimulation of the body. It had almost no inherent positive push but the mental clarity afforded by the drug made it unlikely to become unpleasant. I would certainly do it again but am not sure if I would push the dose higher. To give some ideas of how this compares to some other substances: 10 mg of 5-MeO-MiPT produces similar bodyload, greater visuals, and much greater mental affects; 75 mg of 2C-C produces similar visuals (and much more with lights), less bodyload, and slightly greater mental affects; 25 mg 4-AcO-DMT*Fumarate produces less bodyload, greater visuals, and greater mental effects. I frankly can’t think of any psychedelic that produces this little mental effects without being inactive. "

So, it's been a little while now since the last time anyone reported anything about this one. Does anyone have any more experience to share with it now? I believe that this may be one of the next psychedelics I'll be working with.

DiPT is something I can warm recommend. Not only are the auditory effects remarkable, but what it does to my sense of taste is abso-fucking-lutely insane. I must've eaten a million apples on this stuff. :D


DPT is really intense and can be quite a rough ride, not comparable to DMT at all imho, but really emotional in my experience. Combines well with both ketamine and MDMA, much moreso than most tryptamines.

DPT is extremely readily available, all over the place.  DiPT, not so much...

I've never heard of DiPT's specific effects on taste. Is it the normal enhancement, or is there some kind of shift that goes on, akin the the way sound becomes frequency-shifted?

> Of the related 5-MeO-MiPT...it is very different when smoked.  That is also true of N,N-DiPT.  I've never eaten 5-MeO-MiPT, but I have smoked a lot and there is no stimulation or any of the (what sounds like) annoying side effects.  THis was noted by Shulgin..

A thread common to each of them, is the comparison of the effects of smoking 5-MeO-MIPT to those from smoking 5-MeO-DMT. The speed of onset, the intense depersonalization and loss of immediate contact with one's surroundings, the impressive recall of early memories and the significance of these memories, make the drugs appear similar to one another......All you need to do, to see that clearly, is to look at that one additional observation involving oral activity. This drug, 5-MeO-MIPT, is several times more potent when taken orally than it is when smoked. ...What a rich area for speculation. Preferential metabolism? First pass goings-on? Chemical change from pyrolysis in the pipe? Different receptors? Lipophilicity? I am reminded of the quote from Mark Twain; "I like science because it gives one such a wholesome return of conjecture from such a trifling investment of fact."

Strange, I really dislike 5-MeO-MiPT when smoked, and find it not as strong, and more edgy/weird feeling.  I was trying to vaporize the HCl though so could be why.

I'll definitely write a report on it when I can! ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) I expect that that trip will actually happen very soon, probably after my upcoming one. I'd do it next if not for the fact that it's a 5-MeO tryptamine, since for my next trip I'm kind of wanting something guaranteed to not be very physical. I am very intrigued by it though, more than most I'm guessing based on the reports. I can't help but think about the possible relationship in the EiPT vs EPT bases, as I find many such similarities between the MiPT and MPT bases as well....


But yeah, it does sadly seem to have vanished. ![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif) Or at least, I'm aware of one place that still lists it, but doesn't actually have any. If they don't get more I imagine it could just totally disappear for a while... but maybe I can help bring the hype back! ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png) (At least, if it even turns out to be worth it.)

^ I would love to know the answer to this too. I've taken DiPT a couple times, but not yet to strong effect and I don't recall if I really ate on it or not.

I haven't tried smoking 5-MeO-MiPT yet, but I have to say as well that 8 mg oral for me was both fully satisfying as a psychedelic and pretty lacking in bad body effects, with a slightly uncomfortable warmth being the only particularly noticeable thing, and that was in an apartment with crappy air conditioning. I also didn't find it any more stimulating than most other psychedelics, it was pretty relaxing at times. So, as with everything, I'd say it's probably pretty variable. I'm guessing that smoking it probably wouldn't really feel much nicer to me than just eating it.

I'm not sure I've ever eaten on DiPT either.  I want to take a full dose of DiPT again sometime, in the Spring or Summer, outside on a secluded hike, probably around a waterfall.  In my experience listening to the sounds of the world on DiPT is by far the most rewarding thing to do on it, I remember hearing stuff like trees communicating with other and signals from space, very profound, far more profound than listening to music.  I'll try to remember to bring food and try out whether it alters my sense of taste.


Yeah I find 5-MeO-MiPT very satisfying and great orally at pretty low doses, even 3mg will produce a light trip.  I do find it can have a pretty intense come-up energy, generally I experience fully comfortable come-ups these days but I still get kinda edgy and antsy and a bit anxious on the 5-MeO-MiPT come-up.  But then it passes and I feel wonderful.  It definitely produces energy for me, but it's not like a stimulant, and is quite laid back in how it does so.

Just realized Kaleida didn't post a link to her excellent report on this in the thread, so I'm reposting it here:


##### (5-MeO-EiPT/10 mg) - First Time - A Beautiful Road With A High Toll

This was my first experience on 5-MeO-EiPT. I decided to do this substance on this particular day because it was the first day that I had free to trip back in my apartment after having had to live elsewhere for a good while, and I wanted to do something that should be relatively manageable but...

I m thinking about taking this today, either that or 4-AcO-EPT.
