## Subjective Experience

Pyrazolam was developed during the 1970s at Hoffman-La Roche, and became
widely available via the online markets circa 2012.

I originally purchased it as a potential sleep aid, but research, prior to consumption,
revealed its true niche. It counters anxiety, and is active even at relatively small
doses. I don't suffer from undue social anxiety but I have tested it in a number of
stressful situations. I have always been impressed.

Its strength for me is that whilst acting as an anxiolytic, it doesn't cause drowsiness.
It is functional, or at least has been every time I have sampled it.

It is one of only two benzodiazepines I have used on more than a couple of occasions
(the other being etizolam).

In December 2016, despite the prior implementation of the Psychoactive Substances
Act, pyrazolam and a number of other specifically named benzodiazepines were the
subjects of a UK TCDO banning order, which made personal possession, and not just
import and supply, illegal.

## Dosage & Duration

### Oral

**Dosage:**
- Threshold: 0.5 mg
- Light: 0.5 - 0.75 mg
- Common: 0.75 - 1.5 mg
- Strong: 1.5 - 3 mg
- Heavy: 3 mg +

**Duration:**
- Total: 5 - 8 hours
- Onset: 10 - 15 minutes
**Fatal [overdose](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Overdose) may occur when [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) are combined with other [depressants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressants) such as [opiates](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opiates) , [barbiturates](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Barbiturates) , [gabapentinoids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Gabapentinoids) , [thienodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thienodiazepines) , [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) or other [GABAergic substances](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GABA#GABA_receptors) .**
 
It is strongly discouraged to combine these substances, particularly in [common](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Common) to [heavy](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Heavy) doses.
**Pyrazolam** is a novel [depressant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressant) substance of the [benzodiazepine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine) class.

Pyrazolam was originally developed at Hoffman-La Roche in the 1970s and subsequently "rediscovered" and sold as a [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) starting in 2012.

[Subjective effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effects) include [sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation) , [anxiety suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety_suppression) , [muscle relaxation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_relaxation) , [disinhibition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Disinhibition) , and [euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Euphoria) . Pyrazolam is reported to produce comparibily greater amounts of anxiety supression than sedation and euphoria in comparison to other benzodiazepines, limiting its recreational use. However, this can lead to greater delusions of sobriety when using felt level of sedation to gauge one's level of intoxication.

It should be noted that [the sudden discontinuation of benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine#Discontinuation) can be potentially dangerous or life-threatening for individuals using regularly for extended periods of time, sometimes resulting in seizures or death. It is highly recommended to [taper](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Taper) one's dose by gradually lowering the amount taken each day for a prolonged period of time instead of stopping abruptly.

Benzodiazepines are habit-forming and can produce mental and physical dependence with continued use. It is strongly advised to use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Harm_reduction_practices) if using this substance.

## History and culture

Pyrazolam was originally developed by a team led by Leo Sternbach at Hoffman-La Roche in the 1970s and subsequently "rediscovered" and sold as a [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) starting in 2012. The first official report of the drug came out of Finland in 2011 and another came from the UK in 2012.

## Chemistry

Pyrazolam is a drug of the [benzodiazepine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine) class. Benzodiazepine drugs contain a benzene ring fused to a diazepine ring, which is a seven membered ring with the two nitrogen constituents located at R 1 and R 4 . Bromine is bound to this bicyclic structure at R 7 . Additionally, at R 6 the bicylic core is substitued with a 2-pyridine ring. Pyrazolam also contains a 1-methylated triazole ring fused to and incorporating R 1 and R 2 of its diazepine ring. Pyrazolam belongs to a class of benzodiazepines containing this fused triazole ring, called triazolobenzodiazepines, distinguished by the suffix "-zolam".

## Pharmacology

Benzodiazepines produce a variety of effects by binding to the benzodiazepine receptor site and magnifying the efficiency and effects of the neurotransmitter [gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA)](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GABA) by acting on its [receptors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Receptor) . As this site is the most prolific inhibitory receptor set within the brain, its modulation results in the [sedating](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedating) (or [calming effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety_suppression) ) of pyrazolam on the nervous system.

The [anticonvulsant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anticonvulsant) properties of benzodiazepines may be, in part or entirely, due to binding to voltage-dependent sodium channels rather than benzodiazepine receptors.

Pyrazolam is most selective for the α2 and α3 receptor subtypes. It is excreted by the body unchanged thus not interacting with liver enzymes like other benzodiazepines, meaning that its use in people with reduced liver function may be safer.

Pyrazolam has structural similarities to alprazolam and bromazepam. Unlike other benzodiazepines, pyrazolam does not appear to undergo metabolism, instead being excreted unchanged in the urine. It is most selective for the α 2 and α 3 subtypes of the GABA A receptor.

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation)** - In terms of energy level alterations, pyrazolam is considerably less sedating than other substances of the same class unless it is taken at heavy doses.
- **[Dizziness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dizziness)**
- **[Motor control loss](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motor_control_loss)**
- **[Muscle relaxation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_relaxation)**
- **[Respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression)** ### Paradoxical effects
 
- Paradoxical reactions to [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) such as increased seizures (in epileptics), aggression, increased anxiety, violent behavior, loss of impulse control, irritability and suicidal behavior sometimes occur (although they are rare in the general population, with an incidence rate below 1%). These paradoxical effects occur with greater frequency in recreational abusers, individuals with mental disorders, children, and patients on high-dosage regimes. ### Cognitive effects
 
- The cognitive effects of pyrazolam can be broken down into several components which progressively intensify proportional to dosage. The general head space of pyrazolam is described by many as one of mild sedation and proportionally intense anxiety suppression. It contains a large number of typical [depressants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressant) cognitive effects. The most prominent of these cognitive effects generally include: 
- **[Amnesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amnesia)**
- **[Anxiety suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety_suppression)**
- **[Thought deceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_deceleration)**
- **[Analysis suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Analysis_suppression)**
- **[Disinhibition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Disinhibition)**
- **[Compulsive redosing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Compulsive_redosing)**
- **[Delusions of sobriety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions)** - This is the false belief that one is perfectly sober despite obvious evidence to the contrary such as severe cognitive impairment and an inability to fully communicate with others.
- **[Dream potentiation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dream_potentiation)**
### Experience reports

There are currently no anecdotal reports which describe the effects of this compound within our [experience index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Experience_index) . Additional experience reports can be found here:

- [Erowid Experience Vaults: Pyrazolam](https://erowid.org/experiences/subs/exp_Pyrazolam.shtml)

## Toxicity and harm potential

Pyrazolam likely has a low toxicity relative to dose. However, it is potentially [lethal](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression) when mixed with [depressants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressants) like [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) or [opioids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioids) .

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this substance.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

Pyrazolam is extremely physically and psychologically addictive.

Tolerance will develop to the sedative-hypnotic effects within a couple of days of continuous use. After cessation, the tolerance returns to baseline in 7 - 14 days. However, in certain cases this may take significantly longer in a manner which is proportional to the duration and intensity of one's long-term usage.

Withdrawal symptoms or rebound symptoms may occur after ceasing usage abruptly following a few weeks or longer of steady dosing, and may necessitate a gradual dose reduction. For more information on tapering from benzodiazepines in a controlled manner, please see [this guide](http://www.benzo.org.uk/manual/bzcha02.htm) .

[Benzodiazepine discontinuation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine#Discontinuation) is notoriously difficult; it is potentially life-threatening for individuals using regularly to discontinue use without tapering their dose over a period of weeks. There is an increased risk of [hypertension](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hypertension) , [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) , and death. Drugs which lower the seizure threshold such as [tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol) should be avoided during withdrawal.

Pyrazolam presents cross-tolerance with all [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) , meaning that after its consumption all benzodiazepines will have a reduced effect.

### Overdose

Benzodiazepine overdose may occur when a [benzodiazepine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine) is taken in extremely heavy quantities or concurrently with other depressants. This is particularly dangerous with other GABAergic depressants such as [barbiturates](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Barbiturate) and [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) since they work in a similar fashion, but bind to distinct allosteric sites on the GABA A receptor, thus their effects potentiate one another. Benzodiazepines increase the frequency in which the chlorine ion pore opens on the GABA A receptor while barbiturates increase the duration in which they are open, meaning when both are consumed, the ion pore will open more frequently and stay open longer . Benzodiazepine overdose is a medical emergency that may lead to a coma, permanent brain injury or death if not treated promptly and properly.

Symptoms of a benzodiazepine overdose may include severe [thought deceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_deceleration) , [slurred speech](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Language_suppression) , [confusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Confusion) , [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) , [respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression) , coma or death. Benzodiazepine overdoses may be treated effectively in a hospital environment, with generally favorable outcomes. Benzodiazepine overdoses are sometimes treated with [flumazenil](/w/index.php?title=Flumazenil&action=edit&redlink=1) , a GABA A antagonist , however care is primarily supportive in nature.

### Dangerous interactions

Although many drugs are safe on their own, they can become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with other substances. The list below contains some common potentially dangerous combinations, but may not include all of them. Certain combinations may be safe in low doses of each but still increase the potential risk of death. [Independent research](https://www.google.com/) should always be done to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe before consumption.

- **[Depressants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressants)** ( *[1,4-Butanediol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/1,4-Butanediol) , [2-methyl-2-butanol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2-methyl-2-butanol) , [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) , [barbiturates](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Barbiturates) , [GHB](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GHB) / [GBL](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GBL) , [methaqualone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methaqualone) , [opioids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioids)* ) - This combination can result in dangerous or even fatal levels of [respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression) . These substances potentiate the [muscle relaxation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_relaxation) , [sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation) and [amnesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amnesia) caused by one another and can lead to unexpected loss of consciousness at high doses. There is also an increased risk of vomiting during unconsciousness and death from the resulting suffocation. If this occurs, users should attempt to fall asleep in the [recovery position](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Recovery_position) or have a friend move them into it.
- **[Dissociatives](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociatives)** - This combination can result in an increased risk of vomiting during unconsciousness and death from the resulting suffocation. If this occurs, users should attempt to fall asleep in the [recovery position](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Recovery_position) or have a friend move them into it.
- **[Stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants)** - It is dangerous to combine benzodiazepines with [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) due to the risk of excessive intoxication. Stimulants decrease the [sedative](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation) effect of benzodiazepines, which is the main factor most people consider when determining their level of intoxication. Once the stimulant wears off, the effects of benzodiazepines will be significantly increased, leading to intensified [disinhibition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Disinhibition) as well as [other effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine#Subjective_effects) . If combined, one should strictly limit themselves to only dosing a certain amount of benzodiazepines per hour. This combination can also potentially result in severe dehydration if hydration is not monitored.

## Legal status

Pyrazolam is not explicitly prohibited in most parts of the world, meaning it exists in a legal grey area.

- **Canada** : All benzodiazepines are listed in Schedule IV.
- **Germany** : Pyrazolam is controlled under the NpSG ( *New Psychoactive Substances Act* ) as of July 18, 2019. Production and import with the aim to place it on the market, administration to another person and trading is punishable. Possession is illegal but not penalized.
- **Russia** : Pyrazolam is a Schedule III controlled substance since 2017.
- **Sweden** : Pyrazolam is a controlled substance.
- **Switzerland** : Pyrazolam is a controlled substance specifically named under Verzeichnis E.
- **Turkey:** Pyrazolam is a classed as drug and is illegal to possess, produce, supply, or import.
- **United Kingdom** : Pyrazolam is a Class C controlled substance as of May 31, 2017. It is illegal to possess, produce or supply.

Pyrazolam is a benzodiazepine that was created in the 1970s by Leo Sternbach’s team at Hoffmann-La Roche. It has seen some use since the early 2010s as a member of the research chemical market. The first official report of the drug came out of Finland in 2011 and another came from the UK in 2012.

The drug is largely an anxiolytic at common doses, providing little in the way of sedation. Sedative and hypnotic effects can occur as the dose increases. Higher doses also increase the chance of memory loss and cognitive impairment.

It’s believed pyrazolam passes through the body unmetabolized.

Due to a lack of information, it’s wise to take the lowest possible dose and avoid combinations. Given pyrazolam’s effects, avoiding other depressants is particularly important.

Pyrazolam (SH-I-04) is a benzodiazepine derivative originally developed by a team led by Leo Sternbach at Hoffman-La Roche in the 1970s. It has since been "rediscovered" and sold as a designer drug since 2012.
Pyrazolam has structural similarities to alprazolam and bromazolam. Unlike other benzodiazepines, pyrazolam does not appear to undergo metabolism, instead being excreted unchanged in the urine.

## Legal status

### United Kingdom

In the UK, pyrazolam has been classified as a Class C drug by section 5 of the May 2017 amendment to The Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 along with several other designer benzodiazepine drugs.

### United States

Unscheduled at the federal level. 
Alabama made Pyrazolam a schedule I substance on March 18th, 2014.

## Synthesis

The condensation of bromazepam (1) with methylamine and titanium tetrachloride gives the amidine (2). Treatment with nitrous acid gives the nitrosylation product (3). Further reaction with hydrazine gives (4), which is treated with triethyl orthoacetate to complete the synthesis of pyrazolam.
