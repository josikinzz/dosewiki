## SYNTHESIS
A solution of 118.6 g KOH pellets in 200 mL H2O was placed under N2, and to it was added 24.0 g 2,5-dihydroxythiophenol. With vigorous stirring, there was then added 160 g methyl sulfate at a rate that maintained the temperature at about 60 Â°C. This took about 2 h. After the addition was complete, the mixture was held at reflux for 3 h, and allowed to stir at ambient temperature overnight. It was then filtered, and the filtrate extracted with 6Ã100 mL Et2O, the extracts pooled, washed with 2Ã50 mL brine, dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, and the solvent removed under vacuum. The residue was distilled at 86â88 Â°C at 0.04 mm/Hg to provide 25.9 g of 2,5-dimethoxythioanisole as a white oil that crystallized on standing. Its mp was 33â34 Â°C. An alternate preparation of this compound follows the direct methylation of 2,5-dimethoxythiophenol (see under 2C-T-2 for the preparation of this common intermediate) with methyl iodide.

To 40 mL dry CH2Cl2 there was added 6.07 g 2,5-dimethoxythioanisole, and this was cooled to 0 Â°C under N2. To this well stirred solution there was added 13.02 g stannic chloride over the course of 2 min. This was followed by the drop-wise addition of dichloromethyl methyl ether over 5 min, and the reaction mixture allowed to stir for an additional 15 min. After returning to room temperature, it was stirred for an additional 1 h. The reaction mixture was poured over 15 g ice, and the organic phase separated, washed with 3Ã25 mL 3 N HCl, with 3Ã50 mL brine and, after drying over anhydrous Na2SO4, the solvent was removed under vacuum. The residue was a solid and, after recrystallization from MeOH/H2O, gave 5.86 g 2,5-dimethoxy-4-(methylthio)benzaldehyde with a mp of 95â97 Â°C. Purification via the bisulfite complex provided an analytical sample with mp of 99â100 Â°C. Anal. (C10H12O3S) C,H,S. The malononitrile derivative (from equal weights of the aldehyde and malononitrile in EtOH with a drop of triethylamine as catalyst) was recrystallized from an equal volume of EtOH to give orange crystals with a mp of 185â186 Â°C. Anal. (C13H12N2O2S) C,H,N,S.

A solution of 2.1 g 2,5-dimethoxy-4-(methylthio)benzaldehyde in 7.5 mL nitromethane was treated with 0.45 g anhydrous ammonium acetate and held at steam bath temperature for 6 h. The deep red solution was stripped of solvent to give a residue that spontaneously crystallized. This was ground up under 12 mL MeOH, filtered, and washed with MeOH to yield, after air-drying, 1.7 g of 2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylthio-Î²-nitrostyrene as orange solids. Recrystallization from EtOH provided rust-orange colored crystals with a mp of 165.5â166 Â°C. Anal. (C11H13NO4S) C,H,N,S: calcd, 12.56; found, 11.96.

To a gently refluxing mixture of 1.4 g LAH in 40 mL anhydrous THF under an inert atmosphere there was added, dropwise, 1.7 g 2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylthio-Î²-nitrostyrene in 25 mL THF. The refluxing was continued for 18 h, and the stirring continued for another day at room temperature. There was then added 1.5 mL H2O (diluted with a little THF), 1.5 mL 15% NaOH, and finally 4.5 mL H2O. The white aluminum oxide salts were removed by filtration, and the filter cake washed with THF. The filtrate and washings were combined and stripped of solvent under vacuum yielding a straw-colored residue that crystallized (mp 81â92 Â°C without purification). This residue was dissolved in 25 mL IPA and neutralized with concentrated HCl. The slightly pink solution spontaneously crystallized. There was added 100 mL anhydrous Et2O, and the white crystalline mass of 2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylthiophenethylamine hydrochloride (2C-T) was removed by filtration, washed with Et2O, and air dried. The final weight was 1.0 g, and had a mp of 232â237 Â°C. Recrystallization from EtOH provided an analytical sample with mp 240â241 Â°C. IPA was not a good recrystallization solvent. Anal. (C11H18ClNO2S) C,H,N,S.


## DOSAGE

## DURATION

## QUALITATIVE COMMENTS
(with 75 mg) âI am already aware at a quarter of an hour into it! It develops very quickly but very quietly. There are no visuals at all but, rather, a tactile sensitivity, with warm close feelings. This could be very erotic. There is some fantasy to music, but nothing very demanding. The viewing of pictures doesnât do much either. The drop-off was extremely relaxed, with a good body feeling. At the fifth hour I was able to drift into an excellent, deep sleep with busy dreams. In the morning I felt refreshed and active, without apparent deficit.â

(with 75 mg) âI got up to a thin and fragile plus two, but there was a continuing feeling of a hooded cloak brought down over my head. Nothing obviousâit is transparentâbut it somehow separated me from everything around me. I do not think the overall experiment was worth it.â

(with 100 mg) âMaterial all right, but a little bit along the lines of a âgenericâ psychedelic effect. Sharper edges than 2C-B. The one true negative, which has been pretty consistent with this drug, is that there is a certain emotional removal. One teeny step removed. One is connected with feelings, certainly, but there is a tendency for the intellect to be more evident, in me, than the heart. All this is moderately so. Nothing extreme. Pretty good material, but there are more interesting ones. However, if you are looking for a really short one, this is one of the answers. For most people. For me, itâs still around 5 to 6 hours long. I wish we had more shorties, indeed.â

(with 125 mg) âThere was some physical tummy uncertainty, but once that was past, talking was extremely easy. This is probably really psychedelic, but I am not really sure why, as there is not much in the way of visuals. Dropping was noted just after hour number three, and I was at baseline three hours later.â


## EXTENSIONS AND COMMENTARY
A note on the âTâ in 2C-T. Many, in fact most, of the 2Câs have their name based on the last letter of the amphetamine prototype. 2C-B from DOB, 2C-C from DOC, 2C-I from DOI, 2C-N from DON, etc. And since the original name for ALEPH-1 was DOT (the desoxy- and a thiomethyl group at the 4-position), the 2C-T naming followed this general pattern. And as a note on the subsequent numbering, they (both the ALEPHs and the 2C-Tâs) are assigned numbers as they are thought up. There is no structural significance in the number but they have been, like the houses on the streets in residential Tokyo, assigned numbers in strict historical order, documenting the sequence of construction rather than the relative position down the side of the street.

Both of the homologous mono-ethoxy Tweetios of 2C-T have been synthesized and evaluated. The 2-EtO-homologue of 2C-T is 2-ethoxy-5-methoxy-4-methylthiophenethylamine, or 2CT-2ETO. The benzaldehyde (2-ethoxy-5-methoxy-4-(methylthio)benzaldehyde) was an oil, the nitrostyrene intermediate had a melting point of 137â138 Â°C, and the final hydrochloride a melting point of 215â216 Â°C. The effects were felt very quickly, and there was a blurring of vision. However, the highest dose tried, 50 milligrams, was not able to produce a greater-than-plus one state, and what did occur, lasted for only 4 hours.

The 5-EtO-homologue of 2C-T is 5-ethoxy-2-methoxy-4-methylthiophenethylamine, or 2CT-5ETO. The benzaldehyde (5-ethoxy-2-methoxy-4-(methylthio)benzaldehyde) was impure, and had a melting point of about 66 Â°C, the nitrostyrene intermediate a melting point of 133â134 Â°C, and the final hydrochloride a melting point of 184â185 Â°C. There was a body awareness and modest eyes-closed visuals following the use of 30 milligrams of 2CT-5ETO. The experience was quiet, peaceful, contemplative, and insightful. The duration was perhaps 15 hours and Halcion was needed to allow sleep. There were a lot of dreams, and the next day was restful.

**2,5-Dimethoxy-4-methylthiophenethylamine** (also known as **2C-T** ) is a lesser-known [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) substance of the [phenethylamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamine) class. It is a member of the [2C-x family](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-x_family) of psychedelic phenethylamines, all of which are close relatives to [mescaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mescaline) . It is thought to produce its effects by binding to serotonin receptors in the brain, although the precise mechanism is not fully understood.

2C-T was first synthesized as part of a collaboration between researchers [David E. Nichols](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/David_E._Nichols) and [Alexander Shulgin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alexander_Shulgin) . Its effects and synthesis is described in Shulgin's 1991 book [PiHKAL](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PiHKAL) ("Phenethylamines I Have Known and Loved").

2C-T's subjective effects are not well-characterized. Preliminary anecdotal reports appear to indicate it has some of the psychedelic effects of [2C-T-2](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-T-2) and [2C-T-7](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-T-7) . The effects of 2C-T have been described as being less visual and more tactile.

Very little data exists about the pharmacological properties, metabolism, and toxicity of 2C-T, and it has a relatively short history of human usage. It is highly advised to use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Harm_reduction_practices) if using this substance.

## History and culture

It was first synthesized and studied through a collaboration between David E. Nichols and Alexander Shulgin. However, 2C-T is almost unknown on the black market and is rarely sold online.

## Chemistry

2C-T is in a class of compounds commonly known as phenethylamines, and is the 4-methylthio analogue of 2C-O, a positional isomer of mescaline. It is also the 2C analog of Aleph. The systematic name of the chemical is 2-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-(methylthio)phenyl)ethanamine. The CAS number of 2C-T is 61638-09-3.

2C-T, or 2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylthiophenethylamine, is a substituted [phenethylamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamines) featuring a phenyl ring bound to an amino (NH 2 ) group through a methyl chain. 2C-T belongs to the 2C family of phenethylamines which contain methoxy functional groups CH 3 O- attached to carbons R 2 and R 5 of the benzene ring. 2C-T is also substituted at R 4 with an methyl thioether group.

## Pharmacology

The mechanism of action that produces 2C-T’s [hallucinogenic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hallucinogenic) and [entheogenic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entheogen) effects has not been established in scientific literature; however, its primary psychedelic effects are more than likely a result of its efficacy at the [5-HT2A receptor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin#The_5-HT_system) as a [partial agonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist#Agonists) . This mechanism of action is shared by many other psychedelic [phenethylamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamine) and [tryptamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tryptamine) .

However, the role of these interactions and how they result in the psychedelic experience continues to remain elusive.

Being similar in structure to [2C-T-2](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-T-2) and [2C-T-7](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-T-7) , this compound may have some [MAOI](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MAOI) properties.

## Subjective effects

The effects of 2C-T have been described as being less visual and more in the body.

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*

## Toxicity and harm potential

The toxicity and long-term health effects of recreational 2C-T use do not seem to have been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dosage is unknown.

Anecdotal reports suggest that there are no negative health effects attributed to trying this drug, but nothing can be completely guaranteed.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this substance.

### Dependence and abuse potential

2C-T is not habit-forming and the desire to use it can actually decrease with use. It is most often self-regulating.

Tolerance to the effects of 2C-T is built almost immediately after ingestion. After that, it takes about 3 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 7 days to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). 2C-T presents cross-tolerance with all [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) , meaning that after the consumption of 2C-T all psychedelics will have a reduced effect.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

Although only speculative, it is worth noting that if 2C-T does have [MAOI](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MAOI) effects this could indicate that 2C-T is more likely to induce [serotonin syndrome](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome) or general [neurotransmitter](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurotransmitter) overload (especially at high dosages) than other [serotonergic psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonergic_psychedelic) . This may make it dangerous to combine it with other [MAOIs](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MAOIs) , [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) and certain substances which promotes the release of neurotransmitters such as [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) or [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) . These substances include but are not limited to:

## Legal status

- **Canada** : 2C-T would be considered Schedule III as it is a derivative of 2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine.
- **Germany** : 2C-H is controlled under the NpSG ( *New Psychoactive Substances Act* ) as of November 26, 2016. Production and import with the aim to place it on the market, administration to another person, placing it on the market and trading is punishable. Possession is illegal but not punishable. The legislator considers it possible that orders of 2C-H are punishable as an incitement to place it on the market.
- **United Kingdom** : 2C-T is a Class A drug in the United Kingdom as a result of the phenethylamine catch-all clause.
- **United States** : 2C-T is a Schedule 1 drug in the U.S., making it illegal to possess, manufacture, or import. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2C-T*

2C-T, or 2C-T-1, also known as 4-methylthio-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine, is a psychedelic drug of the phenethylamine and 2C families. It is taken orally. The drug has a relatively short duration and is of relatively low potency among the 2C psychedelics.
The drug acts as an agonist of the serotonin 5-HT2 receptors, including of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor. It is the parent compound of the 2C-T series of psychedelic phenethylamines, with derivatives such as 2C-T-2, 2C-T-4, 2C-T-7, and 2C-T-21, among many others.
2C-T was first described in the scientific literature by David E. Nichols and Alexander Shulgin in 1976. It was described in greater detail by Shulgin in his 1991 book PiHKAL (Phenethylamines I Have Known and Loved).

## Use and effects

In his book PiHKAL (Phenethylamines I Have Known and Loved), Alexander Shulgin lists 2C-T's dose range as 60 to 100 mg orally and its duration as 3 to 5 hours. Its onset is described as 15 minutes and its effects are said to develop "very quickly but very quietly". It is one of the shortest-acting of the 2C psychedelics as well as among the least potent.
The effects of 2C-T have been reported to include being "really psychedelic", little or nothing in the way of psychedelic visuals, some fantasy with music, increased appreciation of poetry, things feeling "opened up" like with MDMA, being a possible MDMA substitute in this regard, feeling somewhat "generic" as a psychedelic, intellectual thinking overpowering emotions, conversational facilitation, tactile enhancement, enhanced eroticism, and stomach discomfort.

## Interactions

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

2C-T shows affinity for the serotonin 5-HT2 receptors and is known to act as an agonist of the serotonin 5-HT2A and 5-HT2B receptors. The drug shows no affinity for the monoamine transporters.

## Chemistry

2C-T is in a class of compounds commonly known as phenethylamines, and is the 4-methylthio analogue of 2C-O, a positional isomer of mescaline.  It is also the 2C analog of Aleph.  The systematic name of the chemical is 2-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-(methylthio)phenyl)ethanamine. The CAS number of 2C-T is 61638-09-3.

### Synthesis

The chemical synthesis of 2C-T has been described.

### Derivatives

A large number of derivatives of 2C-T have been developed and described. These include 2C-T-2, 2C-T-3, 2C-T-4, 2C-T-7, 2C-T-21, and CYB-210010 (2C-T-TFM or 2C-T-36), among many others.

## History

2C-T was first synthesized and studied through a collaboration between David E. Nichols and Alexander Shulgin. It was first described in the scientific literature in 1976.

## Society and culture

### Legal status

#### Canada

As of October 31, 2016; 2C-T is a controlled substance (Schedule III) in Canada.

#### United States

2C-T is unscheduled and unregulated in the United States; however its close similarity in structure and effects to 2C-T-7 could potentially subject possession and sale of 2C-T to prosecution under the Federal Analog Act. This seems to be the tack the federal government is taking in the wake of the DEA's Operation Web Tryp. A series of court cases in the US involving the prosecution of several online vendors were commenced in 2004 and resulted in a number of convictions.
