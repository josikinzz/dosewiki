2-Fluoromethamphetamine (2-FMA) is a stimulant drug of the amphetamine family which has been used as a designer drug. 2-FMA is commonly compared to lisdexamfetamine (Vyvanse), and dextroamphetamine due to its efficacy as a study or productivity aid. 2-FMA is purported to produce somewhat less euphoria than comparable amphetamines, likely due to its main mechanism of action consisting of norepinephrine reuptake inhibition.

## Chemistry

2-Fluoromethamphetamine is fluorinated analogue of methamphetamine, and is a regioisomer of 3-FMA and 4-FMA.
It does not activate the serotonin receptors, including 5-HT2A, unlike most stimulant drugs of the amphetamine family.
