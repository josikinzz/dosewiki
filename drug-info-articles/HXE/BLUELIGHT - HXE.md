Appearently a new MXE analogue. Can anyone tell me what the full IUPAC name would be?

I'm guessing it would be 3-HO-2'-oxo-PCE, but I can't say for sure that's the case.  I'd love to be able to try that, it's closer to MXE than MXPr is.

If you know where to get MXPr, this shouldn't be a problem. It is claimed to gonna be vendor-exclusive but I think other vendors could still easily copy this idea. Kinda hope so.

Yes. They're both arylcyclohexamines. MXE is 3-MeO-2'-oxo-PCE, in the nomenclature of 'PCP'. (MXE has an ethyl group where PCP has a phenyl ring, and MXE has the two additional substitutions, the methoxy and the ketone)


Anyway, HXE has been rumored for years so it'll be interesting to see if it actually shows up

I got an email from a vendor advertising HXE but when I got to the site there was none! I've not bought anything in years but if this is like MXE sign me up for a Kg of it.

Any amateur(or professional) pharmacologists want to speculate on 3-HO-2-oxo-PCE's effects?

Definitely keen to hear some firsthand experiences.

Was mxe really that great? I never ordered when i had the chance because dissociatives don't make me feel objectively "good" like opioids, but who knows.


The only dissociatives i ever really enjoyed were nitrous oxide and IV ketamine (IM ketamine was just weird). The euphorigenic properties are of utmost importance to me. MXE sounds decent though....as fastandbulbous said, "its like ketamine but with the scary bits removed"...


He still alive btw?

Yea, I thought it was. Big doses still had that scary "is-this-gonna-do-me-in?!" vibe, but saner-doses achieved the effect of making everything seem more interesting; otherwise mundane things had a layer of intrigue added. Almost always fun, and positive. Definitely a "brighter" feeling than I get from ket. I'm sure a lot of it is just nostalgia, but it was a keeper. Would love do do it again.

Yes. I would liken it to LSD in terms of greatness. Or to what Catholics wish their communion wafers could be, the flesh of Jesus.


If LSD is God talking to us, MXE is his son, and then... idk, maybe morphine is the holy spirit. The perfect trifecta.

That's weird, did you not shoot for hole doses? I could barely form sentences, my mouth muscles wouldn't work, when I was T+1hr on my way into a hole. Couldn't really talk or walk straight till about T+4hr.

Yeah, MXE really was something special.  I found it strange the first few times I did it, of course I wasn't really into dissociatives then.  Then I "got it" and to this day it's produced some of the most reliable magic of any drug.  It's quite psychedelic for a dissociative.  It's very euphoric, and also deep, and connects me to flow states better than anything else.  For me it has the best combination and ratio of effects present in any dissociative or indeed, almost any drug of any class.

MXE was often better the second or third day of consecutive usage at which point the effects became much smoother.


It's possible that was partially due to metabolite buildup (such as 3-HO-2-Oxo-PCE). At any rate, I'm very excited to try this one.

I hope this is more promising than MXPr. MXE was something else,quite simply spectacular. I found that being on the edge of a hole was better than being in it with MXE. It came on as sheer bliss,if you like opiates and psychedelics then you'd love it,the enveloping warmth that engulfed mind and body,the soaring heights of enlightenment it provided,the Godliness it gave.


You had to be careful though,using it too much brought on psychosis which you wouldn't realise was happening at the time.

I think 3-HO-2-oxo'-PCE is likely to be much more similar to MXE than MXPr is.  That said I always try to remember that I really didn't care for MXE until I'd done it more than a few times.  And the same is true of every dissociative I've ever enjoyed.

Anyone with chemistry knowledge willing to break down the comparison between MXE/HXE/MXPr? I've read reports HXE being more structurally similar to MXE but at the same time this is also a great sales pitch.

It IS more structurally similar, as it is the same as MXE except instead of a methoxy on the 3rd position, there is a hydroxy.  Whereas MXPr has a methoxy on the 3rd position like MXE, but a propyl on the base structure instead of an ethyl.  So actually I guess they're both quit similar, but typically modifications to the core structure will produce more differences than modifications to what is attached to the ring in a particular position.  Like how 3-MeO-PCP and 3-Ho-PCP are more similar to one another than 3-MeO-PCP or 3-HO-PCP is to 3-MeO-PCE.

I used to do ketamine a lot back in 2003 and loved it. I then came across mexxy in 2011 and fell in love with it from the first use,the rest is history.


I think o-pce was close in ways but too much amnesia and much colder,very easy to get fucked up on too.

Anyone care to speculate about potency and duration?


3-ho-pcp is shorter and has about the same potency of 3-meo-pcp, isnt?


Is the same applicable to 3-ho-pce, 3-meo-pce?


I know the proof is in the pudding, but let´s conjure some results

It may very well be better than MXE forgive me for saying it. Many people on here refer to 3-HO-PCP as being more preferred over 3-MeO-PCP. Haven't had either so I don't know personally but from what I've read 3-HO-PCP is pretty amazing and the other somewhat sketchy. Now let's see what this 3-HO-2'-oxo-PCE is about, sign me up right away please.

HXE = 3-HO-2'-oxo-PCE.  3-HO-PCE is different (it's HXE without an oxo on the 2' position).  HXE is MXE with the methoxy on the 3 position replaced by a hydroxy.

Unfortunetly, I got this message.


"But for HXE things aren't looking so good. After receiving the batch it

was too brownish and we sent it back for purification. The informations

are still unclear but apparently they didn't succeed cleaning and also

ruined the production. I'll have more news soon but it's not looking

good."

Anyone able to tell me the full IUPAC name and the CAS # for HXE ? I know of a well experienced chemical corporation I tend to use which allows custom synthesis but that doesn't neccesarily mean they will be able to make it.

Well MXE is 2-(3-methoxyphenyl)-2-(N-ethylamino)cyclohexanone, so HXE should be 2-(3-**hydroxy**phenyl)-2-(N-ethylamino)cyclohexanone 


Pretty sure anyway.  It probably doesn't have a CAS number, as I don't know if it's ever been made.

The company who was going to release this said something about being displeased with the result, which suggested to me it might be pretty difficult, but I really don't know, not being a chemist.  I hope it will be doable, as I bet it would be fantastic.

The problem with something like this lies in protection of the hydroxyl substituent on the phenyl ring. When employing cyclopentyl magnesium bromide in the construction of the cyclohexanone ring, as one would most likely do, a potential difficulty arises due to the terminal oxygen at the 3-hydroxy position on the phenyl moiety. Grignard reactions do not proceed smoothly, if at all, in the presence of terminal oxygen atoms. Methoxy substitution is much less difficult to work with. I suppose the hydroxyl radical could be added at a later point in the synthesis, or one could even reduce a 3-methoxy to 3-hydroxy, but then the question arises as to how to protect the oxygen on the cyclohexane ring. This "HXE" would be a difficult compound to synthesize, but certainly not impossible. 


I would also, dissociative lover that I am, very much like to try it. MXE had a special magic that I've never experienced with any other material. Miss that one. It is still technically legal here in the United States, but I don't see anyone trying to manufacture and sell it... oh well. I would speculate that "HXE" would be much closer in terms of subjective experience to MXE than MXPr is, as others have already stated.

As I understand it, one could easily O-demethylate MXE to form HXE with something like thiphenolate, boron tribromide, hydrobromic or hydroiodic acid.

Yes, provided that one doesn't also partially or entirely reduce the double-bonded oxygen on the cyclohexanone ring. HI would probably be far too aggressive for such an undertaking; perhaps HBr or BBr3 might work. Or even diphenyl lithium phosphide. But the cyclohexanone must be kept intact.


On another note:


To the extent of my knowledge, the presence of brownish impurities in the context of arylcyclohexylamine drugs is generally due to unreacted aryl Grignard reagent - Phenyl magnesium bromide in the case of PCP, or cyclopentyl magnesium bromide for ketamine which would also most likely be employed in the synthesis of substituted compounds like MXE and such. I do know for certain that Grignards do not like to react in the presence of terminal oxygens. In some cases they fail to react entirely. Perhaps this is the problem that was encountered with HXE - an earlier post mentioning the "brown" impurities present in the final product. Proper distillation would have easily separated the desired material from any unreacted precursors, so whomever was making this was not practicing proper laboratory purification. Most, if not all arylcyclohexylamines should appear as pure white to off-white powders in their final state as acid salts. Obviously this does not necessarily mean that they are pure. PCC (1-piperidine cyclohexane carbonitrile, employed commonly in the manufacture of PCP) is virtually indistinguishable from PCP itself in pure form.

I don't expect HBr/HI would react with the ketone, thankfully. Cyclohexanones are quite robust to acid treatment in my experiences.

Hm, I don't think so. If I were a betting man, I would put money on the table that there'd be no Grignard reagent remaining - excess phenylmagnesium bromide (c.f. phenyllithium, they are interchangable and have similar reactivity) will react with even trace amounts of water. They are very moisture sensitive and are easily destroyed by as little as a draft of moist air... hence why Grignards seem to run better in desert environments sometimes. The decomposition/quench product of phenylmagnesium bromide are benzene and magnesium hydroxide/bromide. 


None of the impurities would be expected to pass through an acid-base extraction: there should be no amines in a bottle of PhMgBr. So any colored impurities should be removed, likely at the final step where the free base is precipitated.


Having free protons (alcohol groups, carboxylic acids, etc) will react with the Grignard and destroy it. In practice, the acidity of the phenol on HXE would be high enough that I would imagine it could be deprotonated with e.g. sodium hydroxide, and manipulated as a phenolate salt. A similar technique is used in naproxen synthesis, where a Grignard couples a carboxylic-acid bearing group (present as a magnesium bromide salt) onto the aromatic napthalene. The final work up protonates the salt and you end up with a carboxylic acid.


As for ketamine, the Grignard is conducted rather early in the synthesis, and I would expect there would be at least one purification step along the way, making it unlikely in my eyes for a colored impurity to carry all the way through multiple reactions with no change.

Just read an article (J. Med. Chem. 1982,25,435-440) describing the synthesis of 2-,3,-and 4-hydroxy derivatives of PCP; they used boron tribromide in dichloromethane to demethylate the corresponding anisyl derivatives (i.e. 2-MeO, 3-MeO- and 4-MeO-PCP). This process might work when extended to the ketone compounds such as MXE.

I agree that MXE had a certain magic to it that I have not seen anywhere else.  If only we knew what we had, when we had it.  I am continually flabbergasted by the utter lack of anyone producing it, when it used to be so cheap and readily available, and its lack of illegality everywhere, and its passionate fan base.

It is true that most RCs are made in China, repackaged, and sold elsewhere. I think MXE would actually have reasonable potential in the American market, but the focus here is so much on methamphetamine and heroin that little else is manufactured, aside from a little specialty LSD now and then. PCP has waned in popularity, but it is still manufactured here to some extent as well. But as I said, the US illicit drug market is so caught up in meth and heroin that I don't think we will see production and sale of drugs like MXE anytime soon.

Plus there is less incentive for domestic American RC vendors after what happened to one man who was selling 25x-NBOMe series drugs; someone died of an overdose of 25I-NBOMe, and he was successfully prosecuted for second-degree murder, in spite of the legality of his products (at the time).

I bought a gram of MXE after reading the spiritual trips many were getting from it. I had never tried a NMDA agonist, not even Ket when it was flowing in the 90's. 


The MXE was something else. I used to take it along with psychedelics and would ALWAYS get a ++++ trip. I was God, the universe and everything else inside and outside of time. It elevated my mood and brought me a degree of inner peace.


The gram was followed by a bag of 3 and bags of 5 grams and I used it regularly until it disappeared (had I known it was going for good I would have mortgaged the house!!!) I have some I am keeping for the summer. There's about 1/4 g left and after that - it will be no more ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png) 


If only someone would synthesise it they would be able to make loads of $$$$ as it will be devoured by those who used it and pounced on by those who missed the boat. I am so glad I managed to get it and if I was only to have one substance for the rest of my life MXE would win hands down.


Someone on here has written a book about it, a real love affair that only a unique molecule like MXE could create.

Though I am by no means a professional chemist, I have quite a bit more than a layman's knowledge of synthetic organic chemistry. This is something that I've considered, but as I am already a convicted felon and have gone to prison for clandestine manufacture of PCP, I may never be able to do anything of the sort ever again; I am "on the radar" so to speak, for the rest of my life, unfortunately.

My advice is: 


1. Don't manufacture psychoactive drugs unless you know exactly what you are doing from a chemistry standpoint, and

2. Be prepared to face the legal consequences - the general rule is that someone in law enforcement will catch up to you eventually.

It would be worth relocating to a more liberal country and setting up shop there. You may have to take a while to build up contacts but once you did you'd be drinking coffee from golden mugs while you watch your 292" TV in the penthouse of your own tower block.


Seriously though, recreational market aside, I bet there would be loads of the MAPS people/psychiatrists would love to get their hands on it too. I'd imagine there would be huge potential in treating addictions, depression and anxiety.

I have actually found a vendor with this on their list. I have no idea but there are no bad or good reviews to find yet. Only a website that copied their website that IS a confirmed scammer. I really do hope this one is for real. I would perhaps try a small amount? I am saving up for an other order right now though. ***Deleted****

I am not sure if I could put a link to reddit here... but I won't, just in case.

Anyway, if you do a search there, you can find a couple of posts (9 months old) where some people claim that they were given samples of HXE and MXPr to test these new products and decide which one would be better to go to the RC market. MXPr won and we all know the rest of the story, but if these posts are true that means that HXE has actually been synted and tested, but the testers didn't like it as much as they liked MXPr.

I heard on Reddit that 3 Me-2 Oxo- PCE is in the works, they called it DMXE.

I found 3 me pcp to be very similar to 3 meo. Slightly shorter duration, more euphoria and less dissociation and cloudy thinking. I hope these properties transfer over to the MXE version.

Anyone ever say how hard it would be to synth MXE? I *think *I read it wasn't overly difficult all things considered. I am surprised given the talk on forums such as these that they wouldn't want to cash in on an established and new eager market.

The MXE synth is not all that hard.  As is evidenced by how insanely cheap and plentiful it was for a while.


Honestly the total falling off of MXE despite it not being illegal in a number of places (and despite plenty of illegal things still being produced, even things much less popular) is one of the really strange things about the world, to me.  It doesn't make any sense.  I mean periodically someone pops up to sell "pre-ban" MXE, and it goes for many times what it used to.  Someone could make a killing.

That's what confuses me. Never have drug producers failed to capitalise on such a lucrative market. It's not as if it was especially harmful not had a huge amount of bad publicity which makes the whole thing even stranger. 


I suppose what I was asking was - is the synth not known? Surely there has to be people out there with the ability to replicate it if not the original chemists, so I wonder what is holding them back?

I hope I get to try this, I have DMXE supposedly coming anytime, but international mail from Europe is so slow and unreliable these days, it's impossible to say if I'll ever see it.

The synth is definitely known, and what's more it must not be too hard, as it used to be readily available for cheap.  And very close analogues are being made.  It truly is one of the great drug mysteries of our time, I think.

The general pathway to MXE is known but there aren't any "recipes" out there like there is for stuff like ketamine. That said, it would only take undergraduate knowledge of organic chemistry and a bit of extra research to generalize ketamine's "recipe" to MXE.


I actually wonder what pathway the HXE source used to get there, because I believe the best route goes from MXE. From MXE, your one step away from HXE, and also from something like 3-MeO-2'-HO-PCE. Actually from any of the 2'-Oxo-ACH's you're only one step away from the corresponding 2'-HO-ACH, which makes me wonder why we haven't seen those. I'm omitting details to avoid synthesis discussion, but someone please point out if this strays too close and I'll edit.


Anyways, HXE definitely sounds intriguing. DMXE ended up being quite disappointing for me, which makes me think that the more electron density at the 3 position, the better.

I received my HXE yesterday and did a small allergy test. The powder is finely ground and has off-white color. As some reddit user noted it has distinct and obvious musty smell and also taste, but it's not too strong. I hope this wasn't just an attempt to get rid of old stock. I have very low disso tolerance but i should note i did 5mg 5-meo-mipt about 2 and a half days ago which also interacts with serotonin. I have no previous experience with MXE.


Today i insufflated 5mg as trial run and there was slight dissociation. An hour later i insufflated 20mg. It takes about ~20 minutes to peak, but i'm not completely sure just how long since its very gradual and doesn't hit you as hard as DMXE. It's more sober-like with less motor control loss than DMXE at the same dose, similiar to 3-meo-pcp (edit: ovbiously, 3-ho-pcp, since i've tried that now too) in that regard - but mental high is different. It's slightly sedating in a nice and warm way. There's some entactogenic effects present. The sense of novelty is not as strong, overall it's quite a gentle drug.

Thanks for the mini-report. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  Let us know when you try a higher dose, as it may be that 20mg is just a very low dose.

Hi ! 

I've just try the HXE yesterday, it has a musty smell the taste is not so bad but don't too good neither...

I've try to make a volumetric dilution in some water 50mg in 2ml it wasn't easily soluble and have colored the water in a white milky way...

It was difficult to plug due to the fact that the powder was in  suspension a little in the syringue...

(Note that i have a high tolerance to dissociatives...)

The first ml of what seems to be 25mg was barely notable and i have plug the rest rapidly...

It seems barely hydrophobic, and reminiscent of 3-HO-PCP who is soluble in water but not fast as other Aryl's or MXE, MXPr or MXiPr...

Via nasal it have takes a while to kick in since the rectal dose i've take was'nt too present...

I've decided to put 40/ 50mg (based on what i had previously put on my scale to go to 50mg...)

The half of the powder was taken via nasal but was slow to come as said by [@fugme](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/535235/) and it seems to have the same profile as when i insuflatte some 3-HO-PCP...

The rest of this was taken during the night via sublingual oral to a total of 90mg throught the night...

The compounds was very reminiscent of MXE and it's for me a good sub of PCE...

But the fact that the compound was not responsive good rectally as i'm usually prone with Aryl's and the fact that i've dosed step by step have impacted the effect and the linearity of the molecule...

Anyway i've found some great results listenning to Carbon Based Lifeforms and i had a good dissociation...

Next time i'll go Sublingual/ Oral with a dose in one shot maybe 60 /70mg and improve after but this is my first impressions about the product who seems to shine in a one shot dose...

Sorry for being a bit imprecise it's relatively fresh and i speak and read english but it's hard for me to make a decent trip report...

But when i'll hit my sweet spot i'm sure that the molecule will really shine ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

It sure is quite similiar to 3-ho-pcp, but more recreational. Even at 30mg its more gentle than DMXE, so basically less bang for your buck. Also on more sedating/tiring side.

After a few tests :

Doesn't dissolve in water, a little bit in vodka, may be the "sapo" of the phenol by Na+ works IDK ...

Less potent than the other MXEs analogs, but may be last longer, effects are subtle .

IMO the best choice for an anti-depressant effect ( little bumps) with less addictive effect than the others MXEs , but I cant see other uses for it ATM.

It have a numbing tone (like cocaine numbing), but I don't know enough to tell if this numbing, that I suppose come from the phenol, is related to morphine or propofol ...

Or it's close to the numbing of the Cl of Kétamine, IDK ... 4Meo-PCP was anesthetic to ...

A molecule appart IMO, don't buy it for a MXE substitute IMO, it's not

But perhaps a therapeutic tool ... that can cure the K-head disso craving, or just a new Prozac ?

It is "heady", like it gives "brain accouphenes" lol dunno how to describ it like brain hypertension, like the 3HO PCE/PCP does ...

I don't see a lots of reports, I guess people are puzzled like me with this new one :D 

PS : I guess you can sleep with this one, that would be great on an escapist point of view.

I thought it was a mild drug before, but yesterday i took a standard 25mg dose and realized it is strong, but in its own hydroxy (and 2-oxo) way. i took another 25mg 3 hours later and the high became pretty damn strong.

I got a notice that this was released, but I hadn't realized some of it made it out before this.

Anyways I will hopefully have some of this to try pretty soon. I want to be able to give first hand accounts and comparisons between all these MXE analogs pretty soon.

Hxe is so nice, It has that mxe headspace: contentment, zen, brightness, everything is awesome-feel. I totally forgot about this and focused only on the warm blanket sensations in other analogs, but this has it all. Duration feels more similar to mxe than other analogs. Definitely a winner! For me it feels like the good old days ![🌞](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f31e.png)

Strange that it wouldn't, as MXE dissolved quite readily, and you would expect HXE to be more polar. I wonder what could explain that.


Someone recently posted a proton NMR of what is supposed to be HXE, but the integration of the peaks only adds up to give 18 protons, whereas HXE HCL (what is supposedly being sold) has 20. The solvent used for NMR analysis was DMSO, which doesn't exchange protons, so perhaps there's an intramolecular proton exchange (between the ionized amine and the hydroxyl) which is responsible for the absence of these 2 peaks?


And what's the consensus on HXE so far, more or less potent than MXE? 3-HO-PCP was more potent than 3-MeO-PCP whereas 3-HO-PCE was less potent than 3-MeO-PCE. In light of 3-HO-PCP being more potent than 3-MeO-PCP, my guess is the potency reduction incurred by demethylating 3-MeO-PCE (and possibly MXE as well) is not a consequence of reduced NMDA receptor affinity, but rather a problem of absorption.


With 3-HO-PCP the freebase amine has no protons available for hydrogen bonding, whereas with 3-HO-PCE/3-HO-2'-Oxo-PCE there is one available. 3-HO-PCP would form fewer hydrogen bonds on average and so the desolvation needed to cross membranes would be less costly, energetically speaking, and its passage into the CNS would be more thermodynamically favorable.

This is a possible and well thought out explanation, but on the other hand, both have the same "3-HO-" moiety available for hydrogen bonding in homologous positions, and the amine in 3-HO-PCE, being a secondary amine, probably has a small contribution in solvation energy. I can't come up with any thoughts on the weird discrepancy you pointed out though, so you are probably on the right track.

Finally got my hands on this! So far all I can say is 50 mg intranasal yielded light effects, definite dissociation but not enough discernible to really characterize it or distinguish it from other dissos. Reminiscent of a PCP or PCE analogue with less physical stimulation so far, a short peak and a longer steady comedown but still overall shorter than other related compounds.


Other reports indicate that it seems to dose high- I love more intense dissso experiences so I'm probably going to dive right in with 100 mg sometime this week, I'll report back!


This may be batch dependent but I'd also like to report this is one of of the foulest smelling/tasting dissos I've encountered. I couldn't even take that 50 mg line down in one go, the first slurp made me gag.

MXE is more like K than PCP so it is much more euphoric. It's like K with a much longer half life.

For some reason I get blue visuals with K and I get red visuals with MXE.

I feel MXE visuals are warmer hued because it has much more of a serotonin component than ketamine which is cooler and has blue visuals and less serotonin action/affinity


DCK visuals just seem silloutte'y and lack color and are kinda muddy for me

are nitriles not favorable ? also what of benzofurans and thiobenzofurans, possibly with 1 or 2 position halogen (on the benzofuran), where the catechilamine would be at the 2 or 3 position if you were numbering as a phenyl.


the aromatic thiobenzofuran always made me wonder in phenethylamine 2 or 5 position and also in NBx positions


edit: also please don’t dismiss immediately; thiocyanate makes me wonder because it doesn’t decompose immediately like oxycyanate. and with the right solvent dissolution and roa like rectal; i wonder


i don’t know if that could react with a receptor and bond permanently and make an oversose or lead to neurotoxicity, or if those receptors merely cycle out eventually; yada yada, not maybe something to trial high because it is more unknown but is this a reasonable way to think it could be effective at a 2 or 3 on arycyclohexamines or a 4-phenethylamine psych or a NB-2-thiocyanate ? as a functional group if it could reach the target and dock before decomposition. ?

You sure that the HXE was freebase and not HCL?  How did you get this information?  I'm not sure what arylcyclohexylamine freebases are like, but a freebase shouldn't dissolve in water so I have my doubts this is the case.

I'll be putting this one to the test soon! While I've never been particularly active on online forums, I consider myself to be extremely experienced with MXE and other dissociatives. (DCK, 3-meo-PCP, ketamine, and so on.) The only proper way to consume these chemicals, in my opinion, is by injecting and plugging them. Has anyone attempted an IM injection with this one yet?

Received my sample today, consistency is a fluffy white powder that is surprisingly pleasant to the taste after insufflating 60mg's. I have been in a good mood for the last couple of hours.  Very pleasant experience. I will report back once I go deeper into the experience.

I think HXE has to be one of the most mentally impairing dissos i've ever tried.

This substance is not easily dissolved in water. I think I'd have been better off snorting it than trying to inject it! In comparison to MXE, it's mediocre upon first impression. I'm looking for magic, and this may not be the best place to find it. My previous experiences with MXE have been unrivaled.

IM and I didn't experience a rush at all given that I did it IM. Also, I didn't have any mind-blowing experience like I had with MXE and that may be attributed to a permanent tolerance. This unfortunate tolerance seems to be true with all dissociatives.

Hell yeah, it is! I'm sorry. I saw your Urology Department posts. How are you doing now? I have been on an extensive break from dissociatives and drugs in general besides weed. I got hit by a car last year and I couldn't pass up the opportunity to attempt to try to hang out with the Gods. Also, the purge has come and gone I vomited 2 or 3 times can't exactly remember but I feel fresh and brand new and I feel like starting a vegan diet! Haha! I'm feeling good. It's been a lovely night even with all the puking. Something so spiritual and familiar to all of this!

Hmm for me even small doses at 25-30mg make me feel brainscattered and forgetful, like a mild brain-damage or something. Of course i don't believe it makes any damage, it's just the nature of the high.

Yeah, that is typical of dissociatives. This one is just much gentler than others. However, everyone is different, and this is just my opinion. I'm not saying your experience isn't valid.

I’m very new to HXE but have a history with K. I very much enjoy the duration of H but what would happen if I dosed K with it too? Would it increase the potency? Or would it be a waste of one of them?

Generally I find that combining dissociatives will make them both stronger.  For example, dosing 5mg each of 3-MeO-PCP and 3-MeO-PCE seems to be stronger than the sum of its parts.  My guess is that it will make the K much stronger and color the experience in an HXE sort of way.


I have HXE but have yet to try it, for some reason.

Sneaking suspicion that the aromatic ring hydroxy group will make the molecule more polar than mxe (think what the 3-hydroxy group of morphine does for blood brain barrier penetration. That's why it gets acetylated to heroin). So, I reckon the 3-acetoxy derivative will start appearing shortly... ![😁](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f601.png)

First attempt at 30mg total:


0:00 

15 mg sublingual. Treshold sensation. Mild body and mind relaxation. 


1:00 

Another 15 mg oral. Subtle neutral dissociation, not cold but not really warm. 

Movements have flow, but more like a cute toy animal than a porsche (which would be the case with pcp)


2:00 

No euphoria but some interesting CEV's are present. Less so than MXE, more so than other pce family members.


3:00 - 4:00 

Now feels like a mix between Datura and MDMA.

Very dark and disturbing, but with an entactogenic undertone.


6:00

Baseline 


Pros:


Clearheaded (as far as dissociatives goes)

No real bodyload to speak of


Cons:


Unimpressive

Turned dark halfway through

Thanks for the mini report.  I was surprised to hear "a mix between datura and MDMA".  I guess that was just because of the dark themes, and not any sort of delirium or physical effects?

It surprised me too, especially so considering its mild mannered initial nature. 

There was no delirium, but a brooding almost intrusive sensation that kept seeping in, similar to tropane deliriants, yet an entactogenic element underneath to some degree.

Otherwise, it's a pretty "vanilla" disso. Perhaps it will shine when combined in some way.


I agree with other explorers in that it's surprisingly functional compared to similar compounds, although I'm sure it's dose related.

Still, if you disgregard dosage and go mainly by "level of percieved influence", this one remains more functional at a given level than

any of the others so far. Not that I would challenge that and operate machinery meanwhile, but reading is actually comprehensible

despite obvious dissociation going on. 


It's not "in your face" like pcp, but neither is there magic bells and whistles like MXE.

Hxe lingers in the background, and since it's neither cold or warm, you almost have to 

"search" for it mentally and bodily in order to get to it's core.  


I may return with an update and another attempt, knowing that dissos are usually trial and error

before mastering what's there if anything worthwhile.

Interesting information so far... I was, rather amusingly, just yesterday going through my old "dirty pictures" folder - thousands upon thousands of structural formulae on hundreds upon hundreds of 8.5 x 11 printer paper.


Guess what I found? A drawing labeled "3-hydroxy-2-Keto-Eticyclidine". This was done circa 2009. Not sure if this compound existed in the literature prior to its being offered as an RC, but I came up with it at random 12 years ago. Wow. 


DISCLAIMER: I am NOT saying that I invented HXE or any other shit like that. Just drawing something on paper doesn't count in my book - the material in question has to be synthed and tested.

I can't tell you how grateful I am, for this link to the book (it is from a period during which I didn't really visit Bluelight, due to the death of both my parents, within a year of each other: a seriously dark time, in my life). A big regret is that I never got to discuss his book, with Vortech, for reasons given above. I do know, from personal communication, that mxe helped a bl'er (no names, I leave that to him, due to nature of subject), get through and come to terms with the death of his young son. That, in itself, is a reason to feel good about the birth of mxe (the gutter press love nothing better than horror stories about drug use; more enlightened journalists have written positive things about mxe. My wife put it best, saying that anything that helps the human condition, is something to feel good about: even common salt can destroy lives, if used for malevolent reasons. That really makes the 'dyed in the wool' hippie in me, feel happier!).

I only got about 40 pages in, before remembering I have to get my wife to a hospital appointment today, but after that, I may slip back into my default, useless git mindset, while I digest the rest of the book!

So thank you Xorkoth, for the link and a heartfelt hope Vortech has indeed found the end of his search and Rests In Peace ![💖](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f496.png)

I think the HXE going around is actually freebase because 15mg dissolved in 1mL of vinegar, while 15mg in 1mL of water produced a suspension. I mixed 40mg in total in a cup of water with some vinegar and drank it over the course of 45 min. It doesn't taste great but it's bearable.


Around the 2hr mark it started feeling really good. Body feels extremely stoned and just want to sit down. Nice body high. Soft yet upbeat music is very enjoyable, listening to Lionel Ritchie radio on Spotify. None of the bodily side-effects (diaphoresis, elevated BP, muscle tension) I often get with ACHs. Much less dissociation than other ACHs as well. Feels slightly anxiolytic. Thinking clearly throughout. Very cozy stuff. Effects are never mind-blowing but it hits the spot in a way that few ACHs actually do.


Seems to help with my chronic stomach pain as well, which has been almost completely absent the past few hours, despite a large fatty meal a couple hours before the HXE. No urge to use anymore tonight, but 3.5hrs in I'm still at a plateau. The qualitative effects don't really change throughout the experience. By 5hrs in I'm starting to come down.


Very unique stuff. I'm thinking this will be far and away the best dissociative for combining with psychedelics, and tryptamines in particular.

Easier just to go with distilled vinegar (clear stuff) that is sterile. Pain relief, I reckon is due to action of 3'phenolic group exerting opioid activity (but then, I've been horribly wrong on this topic, in the past!)

If I get some I might try IV, I'll let you know how it goes. I've never IV'd a dissociative before though, anything I should know about that? Might try IV Ket beforehand to see what it's like compared to snorting
