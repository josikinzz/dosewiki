Cyclopropylmescaline (CPM), also known as 4-cyclopropylmethoxy-3,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine, is a psychedelic drug of the phenethylamine and scaline families related to mescaline. It is taken orally and has a very long duration of 12 to 18 hours.

## Use and effects

In his book PiHKAL (Phenethylamines I Have Known and Loved) and other publications, Alexander Shulgin lists the dose range of CPM as 60 to 80 mg and its duration as 12 to 18 hours. Its onset is within 20 minutes and peak effects occurred at around 1.5 hours. The drug is approximately 5 times as potent as mescaline and is longer-lasting in comparison.
The effects of CPM have been reported to include remarkable closed-eye visuals and fantasy, mental imagery synchronized with music, not much in terms of open-eye visuals, heightened tactile awareness, not much insight, daydreaming about eroticism, feeling exposed and vulnerable, sounds including voices and even music feeling intrusive and irritating, and interference with sleep and feeling tired due to its very long duration.
