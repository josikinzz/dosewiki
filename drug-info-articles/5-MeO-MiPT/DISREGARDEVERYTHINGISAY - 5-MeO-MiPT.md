5-MeO-MIPT, or 5-methoxy-N-methyl-N-isopropyltryptamine also known as “Moxy” is a psychedelic and entactogenic drug in a class of compounds commonly known as tryptamines. It is the N-methyl-N-isopropyl homologue of the well know psychedelic 5-MeO-DMT. It has structural and pharmacodynamic properties similar to the drugs 5-MeO-DiPT, DiPT, and MiPT.

This substance has no history of human usage prior to the 1985 publication of its synthesis and pharmacology in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry by Repke, Grotjahn, & Shulgin. In modern times it is used as a recreational drug and an entheogen, rarely sold on the streets and almost exclusively obtained as a grey area research chemical through the use of online vendors.

The mechanism that produces the hallucinogenic and entactogenic effects of 5-MeO-MiPT is thought to result primarily from 5-HT2A receptor agonism, although additional mechanisms of action such as inhibition of MAO may also be involved.

The 5-MeO-MiPT experience contains a complex and wide array of effects which based on the predefined potential subjective effects index found [here](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effects_index), I will now begin to breakdown and describe.

**Physical Effects:**

The physical effects of 5-MeO-MIPT can be broken down into three components all of which progressively intensify proportional to dosage. These are described below and generally include:

- **Spontaneous tactile sensations** - the body high of 5-MeO-MIPT can be described as a pleasurable, warm, soft and all encompassing glow. There is also a cold, sharp tingling sensation that is manifested spontaneously at different unpredictable points throughout the trip but for others it can maintain a consistent presence that steadily rises with the onset and hits its limit once the peak has been reached.
- **Stimulation** and **Sedation** - in terms of its effects on the physical energy levels of the tripper, 5-MeO-MIPT can be both sedating and stimulating. The physical energy levels seem to manifest themselves in waves in an unpredictable pattern. This seems to be partially setting dependant and during physically strenuous situations such as running or dancing it can become stimulating and energetic. In contrast however, in calm environments such as darkened rooms with comfortable seating it can become relaxing, peaceful and even moderately sedating.
- **Nausea** - as the tripper begins to come up, nausea is not uncommon and can sometimes result in initial vomiting, but passes once this over or the trip begins to fully set in. In comparison to other psychedelics such as psilocin, LSD, and 2C-E, this could actually be very considered very mild in its intensity. In comparison to 5-MeO-DIPT, this substance has a much lower tendency to trigger unpleasant physical reactions and has been described as much less physically stimulating.

**Cognitive Effects:**

The head space of 5-MeO-MIPT is described by many as one which is both insightful and moderately relaxing, but at some points quite stimulating. This substance produces a large number of general psychedelic cognitive effects. The most prominent of these effects generally include:**
**

- **Introspection** - this component is consistently manifested only in the context of a non social setting in which the user is alone.
- **Increased empathy, love and sociability** - this component is consistently manifested only in the context of social settings in which one is within the company of others. These feelings of sociability, love and empathy are a little weaker and less sharp than those found on substances such as MDMA and 2C-B but still prove strong enough to provide long lasting therapeutic effects.
- **Acceleration of thought**
- **Connectivity of thought**
- **Time distortion**
- **Feelings of fascination, importance and awe**
- **Conceptual thinking**
- **Enhancement of current mind state**
- **Removal of cultural filter**
- **Ego suppression, loss and death**

**Visual Effects:**

*Enhancements*

5-MeO-MIPT presents a complete array of possible visual enhancements which generally include:

- **Increased visual acuity**
- **Enhancement of colours**
- **Enhanced pattern recognition**

*Distortions*

As for visual distortions and alterations, these generally include:

- **Visual drifting** (*melting, breathing, warping and flowing*) - In comparison to other psychedelics, this effect can be described as highly detailed, slow and smooth in motion and static in appearance.
- **Tracers**
- **After images**
- **Texture repetition**
- **Colour shifting**
- **Scenery slicing**

*Geometry*

The visual geometry that is present throughout this trip can be described as more similar in appearance to that of psilocin, 4-AcO-DMT, or ayahuasca than that of LSD or 2C-B. They can be comprehensively described as structured in their organization, organic in geometric style, intricate in complexity, large in size, fast and smooth in motion, colourful in scheme, glossy in colour, equal in blurred and sharp edges, and equal in rounded and angular corners. At higher dosages, they are significantly more likely to result in states of level 7B visual geometry over level 7A.

In terms of their manifestation, they are progressive in nature and continuously self-complexify in settings with little to no visual input and disturbances. For example, darkness will cause the geometry to progressively intensify, but this can immediately be reset back down to base level by simply turning on a bright light or actively performing a physical task which requires any level of concentration.

*Hallucinatory States*

5-MeO-MIPT produces a full range of high level hallucinatory states in a fashion that is more consistent and reproducible than that of many other commonly used psychedelics.

These effects generally include:

- **External hallucinations**
- **Internal hallucinations** - in comparison to other psychedelics such as LSD, 5-MeO-MIPT is extremely high in hallucinations embedded within visual geometry. This particular effect commonly contains hallucinations with with scenarios, settings, concepts and autonomous entity contact. They are more common within dark environments and can be described as internal in their manifestation, lucid in believability, interactive in style and almost exclusively of religious, spiritual, mystical or a transcendental nature in their overall theme.

**Auditory Effects:**

The auditory effects of 5-MeO-MIPT are common in their occurrence and exhibit a full range of effects which commonly include:

- **Auditory enhancements**
- **Auditory distortions**
- **Auditory hallucinations**

**Differences in Methods of Consumption:**

This substance can be taken via oral ingestion or it can be smoked. When ingested orally, the experience puts more of an emphasis on visual effects but can be broken up into two stages. The first half of the trip feels stimulating and entactogenic while the second half feels more similar to a traditional typtamine psychedelic.

If smoked, however, these stages of experience are not present and the experience places more of an emphasis on physically and cognitively stimulating effects accompanied by subtle and mild changes in visual perception.

**Health Effects, Addiction Potential, and Tolerance:**

The toxicity of 5-MeO-MiPT is not known but (as with all research chemicals doses) should be carefully weighed on an accurate milligram scale and users should take extreme caution to work their way up from threshold dosages. There are many reports of vasoconstriction and uncomfortable increases in heart rate and this should be taken into account.

5-MeO-MIPT and MAOIs are a potentially dangerous combination. It is likely that MAOIs could increase the effects of 5-MeO-MIPT unpredictably. Taking this chemical while under the influence of ayahuasca, harmala alkaloids, AMT and prescription MAOIs (such as certain antidepressants) is strongly discouraged.

5-MeO-MIPT is not physically addictive and many users experience a frequency self-regulating quality to the drug. Tolerance seems to be very moderate and does not build up without repeated use over a short period of time.

**Legal Issues:**

- **USA:** 5-MeO-MIPT is technically not scheduled in the United States, but could be considered an analogue of 5-MeO-DMT and therefore a Schedule I drug.
- **UK:** 5-MeO-MiPT is a Class A drug in the United Kingdom as are most ethers of ring-hydroxy tryptamines.
- **Romania:** 5-MeO-MIPT and other derivatives are illegal in Romania as of January 2011.
- **Japan:** 5-MeO-MIPT is controlled as a “Designated Substance” (Shitei-Yakubutsu) by the Pharmaceutical Affairs Law, making it illegal to possess or sell.

**Conclusion:**

5-MeO-MiPT is an extremely interesting and powerful substance and can be considered as the most useful and therapeutic entactogenic experience found with the tryptamine compunds. For those who are familiar with them, the overall effects of this substance can be described as mixture between ayahuasca, MDMA, psilocin and 5-MeO-DMT.
