## Effects
Perceptions and feelings become more intense. From 10-15 mg (snorted already from 7 mg), the effect usually takes on a hallucinogenic character. The boundaries between inside and outside can dissolve. Often moving coloured patterns and luminous fields around objects and persons are perceived. However, the intoxication is felt to be less profound than with LSD.

## Dosage
2C-I is effective even in small doses; even 2 mg more or less can make a big difference in the effect experienced; a gradual approach to the individual dose is recommended. Doses above 35 mg can be experienced as unpleasantly strong even by experienced users.

## Risks

### Short-term Risks
The pupils dilate, blood pressure rises and nausea, sweating and dizziness may occur. Some users report stomach and intestinal problems, and mild allergic reactions (such as coughing due to increased mucus production) may occur. Disorientation, confusion and feelings of anxiety, even fear of death, are risks on a psychological level.

### Long-term Risks
There are no research results on long-term risks so far.

## Safer Use
- 2C-I seems very setting-dependent and is only suitable for parties to a limited extent.
- Be aware of set and setting: Use 2C-I only in places where you feel comfortable and safe. Do not use if you are afraid of the drug.
- Never consume 2C-I alone and only when you feel mentally and physically well and are well rested.
- Do not add more, dose carefully.
- Drink enough water during the trip.
- Follow the safer-sniffing rules when sniffing.
- People with cardiovascular diseases and diabetics are at increased risk when consuming 2C-I.
