DOI is a psychedelic amphetamine that was first synthesized by Alexander Shulgin, who described it in PiHKAL (1991). It has been used recreationally and is a common scientific research tool.

Like other members of the DOx class (e.g. [DOM](http://thedrugclassroom.com/video/dom/) ), DOI has a long duration of action. It’s not uncommon for people to be incapable of sleeping for 24 hours or more, particularly with strong+ doses.

As we still don’t fully understand its effects in humans, minimizing your use and taking common doses is wise.
