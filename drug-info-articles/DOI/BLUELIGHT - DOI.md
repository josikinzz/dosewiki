Original post:


You know im not sure if there is one of these threads already but i couldnt find one. If there is, sorry for starting a new one...


anyways, i have found very limited info on this rare chemical DOI.

I have not had the chance to do anyof my own personal research with this chemical but i soon will.

Id just like to get any info i could on it.

Thank you much

I tried it once, at a dose to low to get a real feel for it (4mg), but.. not bad, except it lasts way to long, although that is just my opinion, of course. That dose may be plenty for some people, I was just expecting more

In my experience 4mg is *not* a low dose.  I've gotten full psychedelic effects from 1.5-2mg, and haven't had the desire to go higher because of the exhausting length of the experience.  I could sleep at T+16 or so, but a good part of the next day I was above baseline.  Besides the somewhat annoying duration, the high is great - gentle, malleable, lucid.  Very lucid.  A lot of psychs can feel cloudy, but I feel almost sharper than usual on DOI.  I give it my thumbs up.


I'd be interested to hear of any combinations with DOI.  I bet it'd be great as a baseline drug at a low dose, then augmented with something more powerful.  Does anybody have any experiences with combos?

Have to agree, 4mg wasn't a low dose for me. First 2 hours were quite gentle, then it shifted gears and became a tad overwhelming for the next hour. After that it levelled out and was a gentle, not too overpowering experience as it's a fairly malleable trip.


It lasts for ages though, next morning, when I had to go shopping, I was still fairly tripping which made a Sunday morning in a supermarket quite a strange experience

Perhaps cross-tolerance, I'd done 2c-e about 36 hours before. In any case the length of the trip makes me unlikely to repeat soon.

What about taking a xanax before to possibly shorten the duration or maybe it easier to go to sleep later.  Maybe this isnt a great idea, so what do you think about taking xanax when you want to come down?  I know it works with shrooms and acid, but a friend tried it with DOB and said the DOB overpowered the bar and he still could not sleep.  What are yalls opinions on this?

^^^Worth a try, I guess. I took the stuff on a Sunday morning, tripped all day, got a little sleep (sorta) that night, and was still at a +1 (Shulgin's scale) at work the next day. I work with saws and shit, a little freaky.

the nice thing about DOI (at least at the moderate doses i've tried), is that you can pretty easily sleep on it.  although its really weird to wake up still tripping

um, takine xanax or any benzo, or any downer when you dont want to trip anymore works. For example last night i ingested 4mg DOI at 400 pm, it kicked in around 7:30, at 12:00 i ate 3 15mg remerons, and feel asleep by 1:00, i woke up at 6:20am for work and i was refreshed. Although i was only working for an hour before it started to downpour. The day after DOI puffing some buds can kinda make you feel like your tripping. But xanax or anything like that would be wonderful to end your trip, and i couldnt see DOI overpowering enough downers. But does anyone have any suggestions with combos? DOC and DOI i think ill do em both 2mg of each and post my report.

i found that it mixed very well with 2CE and enhanced MDMA.theres a trip report in the TR forum,i kept re-dosing and adding things over a period of 70 hours.since then ive only taken it once,that was 3mgs and was augmented with 0.3mg of brown heroin,chased.that went very well too,i would float off into the heroin trip,but at the same time was able to focus and reflect on lots of things that were happening at the time.the body high was lovely,much more aglow than if it was just H.

i wouldnt reccomend taking heroin to anyone,but have done occasionally myself for many years,sometimes at the tail end of trips,but i had a feeling that these would go well together as i remembered glowing so much on my first DOI trip,where i ended up combining it with 2CE,DMT and MDMA all to good effect.

**I had an extremely intense trip on 6.5mg of doi a few days ago. It was one of my best trips. **The visuals were more intense than any I had previously had, even better than 36mg of 2c-e. Very often the visuals were disgusting, maggots, blood, slime, chunks of flesh and insects covered everything including my body. It made me look kind of like a corpse or zombie. 


There were also very beutiful visuals. Many were so amazing I don't think I could possibly describe them. There is nothing on earth to compare with it. It was possibly the most beutiful thing I have ever seen. It was a tree but the DOI transformed it into something with thousands of unique beautiful parts. It looked completely alien.


Mentally it was also very intense. I felt myself combine with a cat and a tree and I was blended with them for a few seconds. When I came back it seemed like part of my mind was gone. 


There were moments when I did not know who I was. Other moments when I felt an intense connection with everything. I could sense the spirits of animals that I was with. The trip was very euphoric and I would say quite spiritual. Several times I felt close to a +4.


I am normally an atheist but did not feel much like one in this trip. I may actually be agnostic instead of atheist right now.


I was at +3 level for probably about 36 hours. After  maybe 45 hours I was down to a weak +2 and I went to sleep.


 I was feeling minor effects all through the next day. Neither pleasant or unpleasant until eating some poppies. The poppies seemed more enjoyable than usual. This was one of my best trips. I may try to write a trip report. At this time, DOI is my favorite substance. I love it! Before trying DOI I thought it would be an enjoyable but not very intense and much less visual than 2c-e/p and lacking the depth of 2c-e/p, miprocin or HBWR. When I tried it I found out I was very wrong and being wrong has never felt so good :D 


I am expecting to get some DOC and 2c-c soon. I am going to try those by themselves but after that I will try them combined with DOI.

I will do DOI+2c-c first and then try DOI+DOC. 


I'd love to try DOI with 2c-p or 2c-e. I think that would be an amazing intense trip. I can't imagine how intense that would be. And the visuals would probably be overwhelming.


I am having a very good time right now on 8mg of DOI+Lots of poppies and 40mg of valium. I took a higher dose of DOI due to tolerance from using a few days ago. It is less intense but feels amazing. It is so peaceful and relaxing. This is amazing stuff.

Until i try DOC,  DOI is definately my favorite as of now in the RC field.  (This excludes the classics)


My average dose is 10-14mg.

About a week ago though, i snorted (first time snorting) about 4mg, and licked maybe 2mg worth and had the most intense DOI trip of my life.  Like the back of the nirvana album In Utero...with all that strange gross shit(fetuses and shit) all tangled and melting into itself.

Quight strange, but not scary.  Went to a rehab meeting the next day and i had to leave early cause the TV almost got up and starting walking towards me, i kid you not. 

good stuff.

My dose was well below the 80mg of snorted DOB.  And judging by side effects, DOB is probably more toxic than DOI.


I doubt if I will exceed 10mg of DOI. I think that is well within the non-fatal dose range. It would probably be unpleasant for some people though.


I'd like to try some of the alephs but I have never seen any available.


EDIT:I added more info: 


I again felt close to having a +4 experience at times on this trip. Also leaving the real world, and my real body to experience some strange fantasy places. Most of the time I had enough awareness that it was not real that I could stop it. 


While being on something like a small ledge above a hellish place it did not occour to me that it was fake and I could stop it. This lasted longer than the other fantasy places. I felt fear and intense euphoria both at the same time.


Right now I am getting lots of erotic images. Seeing shapes of women in the walls ans lots of vaginas. I'm not feeling any more interested in sex or masturbation than usual.


I may try to write a DOI trip report within a  few days.

So what is the deal with this compound? Completely worthwhile? What is the starter range....1mg-3mg? What is the psychonaut range? Above 5mg? I've been reading all that I can about this, but there just isn't enough out there. Are there any long term effects?

I can't answer your question now, but I broke down and obtained some DOI.  Sometime soon I will experiment.  Although I expect DOC to be smoother and shorter (which with DOX compounds is a good thing), DOI has me very curious, due to the clarity of the trip that people describe, as well as the fantastic visuals.  DOC has fantastic visuals as well, but I'm interested to see how DOI differs.


I'll post about it whenever that happens.

High, sure.  I think it was 80mg though, if I recall.  So not really that high.  I mean, DOB seems like the most physically dangerous of the DOXs, but still... all I know is that the growing availability of DOXs makes me nervous.

I experimented with DOI combos, but as you say DOI is great base/ground supstance to add other stuff on. I like it cuz it lasts long enough to be base for entire party + after + chillout. One person I know had somewhat bad experience with DOI + MDMA. The experience itself wasn't bad, but he had a blackout period of maybe 6-8 hours and he doesn't remember a thing from that time. He was with me most of the "blackout period" and he had a great time not showing any signs of not being at operative state or of the hook...later he told me he doesn't remember anything until the certain event in the morning...


I did the same combo + lsd the same night and haven't experienced anything comparable to his story...

I had 10mg of some very pure DOI.


I diluted the 10mg into a glass of water, which was evenly divided between me and 2 friends. (3.5mg dose each approx)


For the first 2 hours there was nothing but waiting, which was expected.  At the 1 1/2 hour mark there was mild stomach discomfort which prevented me from finishing off my beer.


At about 2 1/2 hours very faint patterns began to emerge. A strange feeling of warmth was washing over our skin not unlike a very faint warm breeze. After about 3 hours there was a definite note in effect. 4 hours the sky was flickering and lighting up, but appeared very 'robotic' or 'synthetic'


at the 6 hour mark it was clear that not much more was going to happen. Note we were sitting around a campfire next to a lake.


The most noteable thing about DOI is the FUCKING GRINDING OF THE FUCKING TEETH which is more irritable than anything else and it is very hard to take your mind off it. Chewing gum or lollypops are completely futile in trying to fight off this fiend. If it weren't for the grinding, I perhaps would have enjoyed it more. My friend grinded his gums out and had to get one of his molars taken out just from dosing this DOI.


It's very speedy. No chance of sleep. Grinding of the teeth, psychotic laughter and a very 'cracked out' feeling. At 12 hours it becomes tiresome. I had to work the next day after no sleep which was frustrating because patterns were moving and breathing everywhere. SLeep was possibly about 38 hours after taking the drug.


Patterns move, and 'shimmer' a lot, but they definately aren't the more noticeable feature of this chemical. I would never do it again, but if I had no choice and a supply of it I would probably do it at a 3 day rave just for the amphetamine qualities, perhaps with some MDMA or something else. LSD or mushrooms would be a stupid idea, as it would just make the trip purely uncomfortable.


There is a report on erowid somewhere of a guy dosing about 15mg of it with uncontrollable urination and EXTREME body discomfort verging on hospitilsating.


So yeah, careful with it. It's definately not my favourite DOx compound and by no means 'deep' or 'profound'. Clear headspace all the way through with minimal/low-mild visuals.

I consider my experiences with DOI to be the most singularly positive experiences in my life.  This chemical, more than any other (although it is almost a tie between DOI and DXM) psychedelic has helped me attain a more peaceful disposition and a more positive outlook on life itself.  The headspace of DOI (for me, YMMV) is so peaceful and long-lasting, with waves of euphoria that come in a transcendental fashion, that it fills me with hope, rather than a dread of coming down.  That is, DOI is (other than DXM and possibly 4-HO-DiPT), one of the few chemicals that gave me the time to do some real psychical work--it was not simply an acute dopaminergic impulse (such as the fleeting and unfulfilling blast of orgasm, N2O or a line of cocaine), but a lasting 'ocean of time and peace.'

Yeah.  A lot of people seem to think that DOI is a lot less mindblowing and introspective than DOC, but I don't think that's true at all.  It's a very rough, but ultimately rewarding ride for me.

I'm hoping to try DOI intraveinously soon. DOI is really good chemical in my opinion, once you get used to the body load. I NEED a pacifier with this, and a massage is the most amazing thing in the world. Really cool visuals, lots of overlay and "growing" or morphing visuals. With all of my experiences, 2.5-3.5mg taken from 7-10mp (every time) have all resulted in tripping all night, sometimes getting a few hours of sleep (one time I managed 6 fucking hours, wow) and waking up in a semi-tripping haze (if I wake up)


Oh, one more thing. Smoking pot when tripping intensifies this SO much for a good few hours. My first trip involved a fat blunt of chronic 3 hours into the actuasl trip, blacklights, glowsticks, and something similar to a rave. The marijuana turned my night into a fucking cartoon.

Question: Why is an alcohol solution needed? Is it just to prevent mold/contamination?


Whats DOI (or DOx for that matter) most soluble in? Water or alcohol?


Is it better to have a stronger alcohol or a weaker alcohol? Is it better to use Everclear (95% alcohol) or something like watered down vodka? And why?

DOI is soluble in ethanol, water, isopropanol, and water-ethanol solutions.  The ideal storage solution is probably some mixture of ethanol and water, as that's generally easier on most storage containers than purer ethanol, and keeps your samples sterile.  DOI is most instantly soluble in water, but will dissolve within ethanol solutions at room temperature within 1-2hr.  The more ethanol, the longer it takes to fully dissolve.  This is true for most of the 2,5-DiMeO-PEAs.

The duration is what personally scares me away from it. I just don't feel at the point where I want to trip that long. I think it would not physically be good for me.


I'm usually very physically active during psychedelic experiences and it exhausts me (even though I am in reasonable good shape). I'm unsure how I would react to the amphetamine analogue of chemicals that are ALREADY very stimulating to me.


I have taken a threshold dose (1mg) and it was good, although I couldn't really tell near the end when I actually was still tripping and when I wasnt.


Do some find it overstimulating?

Stronger alcohols will have less impurities. The reason vodka (for example) tastes like anything at all is that it has impurities in it. Since people drink vodka all the time, we know those impurities aren't harmful to you, but as a point of being as careful as possible you'd want a stronger alcohol.


Everclear in the water will indeed help fight off mold and bacteria. Keeping the liquid extremely cold also helps, and using an ethanol/water solution has the added benefit of keeping the liquid from freezing.


As for why you'd specifically use one or the other, I really don't know, but I'd assume there are differences in how much of a chemical each can hold in solution. With a low dose RC like DOI that's not going to matter.

I had a hell of an experiance the other day with a low dose(2.5mg) of doi and a low dose of dxm; 60mg followed by 300mg 2 hrs later to ensure there was no interaction between the 2 chems. The combo was far more visual than the doi on its own, and no major negatives were noted. I spent the day hiking and fly fishing the Big Thompson River in northern Colorado. I caught 4 brown trout and a rainbow trout if anyone was interested. 


I started the experiance at about 8am, expecting it to have a very long duration. I was correct as I was not able to sleep til t+26H from ingestion of the doi. I was very tired the next day( probably due to <5 hrs of sleep), but otherwise felt physically fine with no after effects post sleeping. Overall it was a very rewarding trip. ( I am working on a more detailed writeup for trip reports and erowid also.)

The DOI thread is now back on topic. This one was so off topic it wasn't even funny (actually, it was kinda sad). But I reduced it from a 7 page thread to a 2 page thread.


Anyone have anything to add about this one?

For someone with no tolerance, 2.5mg of DOI really is not a low dose.


trip.more, what do you find to be a good, pleasant, starting dose of DOI?  I've yet to try mine but I've been meaning to for a long time.  I love the duration of DOC so I don't think DOI will be an issue.  Also, I find low doses (1-1.5mg) of DOC to be very nice and a good day enhancer.  Is the same true with DOI?  Or is it better to take a low-end full dose?

Id like to add something, when I had DOI/C/and M doi has been the most potent of them all, and the known DOI blotters Iv had have been more potent then the DOC ones as well. Iv also noticed a pretty sharp dose/response curve in doi which is not as noticable with DOC, DOM I have only one experience with but it was nothing as intence as what I was able to reach with I/C. 


Low dose DOI IMO is like a long low dose general psychedelic trip, It has no REAL character beyond just a great "million bucks" type psychedelic feel (it can have kinda icky moments though). But anything over 2-3 (yeah, I dont know the exact amount) will bring with it this new aspact of being completely submersed in the expereince. While lowdose DOC has been more of an annoyence in that more was needed, NOT that it was a different type of effect all together. This is personal expereince and has been expresed by those who were also privledged to take part in them, but as we all discussed and came to conclusion it is biased from that stand point.

Are there cross-tolerance issues with DOI and tryptamines? I've experimented with a few in the last couple of months, and I'd like to try a dose of DOI before ceasing my experimentation for a month or two to let my body normalize. I've definitely noted tolerance issues between the tryptamines that I think is more than just my usual psychedelic hardheadedness.


I'm considering starting at 2mg and adding .5-1mg (all via liquid measurement) a couple of hours later if I don't get where I'd like to go. Does this seem reasonable?

I've noticed with DOC that adding more does increase the intensity somewhat but not as much as it would have by just taking it all at once.  However, 2mg of DOI in itself should definitely be psychedelic.  Adding more later on will definitely increase the duration somewhat.  Unfortunately, I can't answer for sure because I've yet to take DOI.  But I would expect it to act pretty similarly to DOC in that respect.


As for tolerance, it seems to me that all psychedelics produce mental tolerance to all other psychedelics.  But physical tolerance, probably not.  And the mental tolerance will definitely not be as great as if you were to take two phenethylamines or two tryptamines close together.

.5 mg DOI was found to be active, although very mild, not much in the way of psychedelic; almost amphetamine like. It felt nothing like low dose 2C-I, and even at .5mg I could sense that this compound could be powerful.

Breakingset, what did you do while on the .5mg? Did you notice increase or decrease in cognitive abilities?


My 1mg experience left me in a very unusable state, cognitively/rationally. It did not leave me feeling like it could be a useful psychedelic (maybe for a full day of hiking, but not so much for thinking).

No, 1 ml would be around 1 mg.  If you want to know how much is 1 ml, get an oral syringe from, well, anywhere.  Also, make sure you can measure the 50mg accurately.

I have a graduated cylinder that can measure ml and an electronic scale that measures to the 0.002 range. its just an eye dropped (such as a visine bottle) makes it much easier to apply to small areas.

Don't do it.  Seriously, there is absolutely no reason whatsoever to put anything that's not acid on blotter.

I just wanted to throw in another positive response for DOI.    It's one of few psychedelics that doesnt leave me feeling disappointed when it ends.  When I come down from other stuff I feel sad that it's done. On DOI i feel that I always trip just the right ammount of time.


The one exception (my first hard trip, and my first on DOI) being that I dosed one time on a Saturday evening and then tripped solidly till about midnightish on Sunday. I could not get to sleep and I had to go to court the next day and I terrified myself thinking that I was going to be stuck without sleep and still tripping when I went to court.


When I have a couple days where nothing matters then DOI, right now at least, is my drug of choice.


I look forward to trying DOC at some point but the fact that I've only seen it available in gram quantities is a little disappointing

A question for those of you who are very experienced in psychedelics and DOX, as well as DOI:


I have decided that I'm going to finally "go for it" with DOI tonight.  Of course, I know the recommended dosage range.  I just want to get an opinion or two from someone on what dosage they would personally take.  Although I haven't tripped all week, my general phenethylamine/psychedelic amphetamine/psychedelic tolerance is undoubtedly still pretty solid.  As I know that's also true with a few others around here, I'd like to know what you'd recommend as a dosage for a full experience, keeping in mind that I find its cousin DOC to have virtually no bodyload, nor any propensity for fear.


Thanks! ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I'd say 2mg - that's the dose I normally go with and it's always been the goldilocks dose (not too much, not too little, just right ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif))

i've been finding that even in low doses (1-2mg), i get aural hallucinations of the internal variety. if i do sense deprivation it's pretty intense ... i am hearing screams and all kinds of fragmented conversation as if i was riding a school bus. this stuff just makes me feel crazy! somebody said it in the other thread but 'manic' is a good word to describe.


the body load is kind of bittersweet ... there's a real spazzy restlessness and weak/cold kind of thing happening, but it's also euphoric in its own weird way. same for the emotional side, kind of a sad beauty to everything.


at what doses do you guys find the visuals start to come out a bit? i haven't been able to push past 3mg yet ![:|](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eyesclosed.gif)

Planning ingesting 8mg later today. I'll do a TR if I can remember to keep notes. I usually get a little confused on DOI. Shame to see this thread so inactive, but I suppose the other DOxes have killed DOI.

^ I'll post a full report in TR later, but I'll include basic specifics for the sake of this dwindling and sadly-overgrown thread!


Apparently I'm some kind of sick genetic mutant. I dosed 8mg (known, 99.9% lab grade) DOI and had an amazing trip today. About 45 minutes passed from dosing to first alerts, at which point I actually fell asleep reading (The Celestine Prophecy) and had the glorious experience of waking up tripping absolute balls. Time elapsed from initial dosing was ~2 hours 30 minutes, which would mean I went from alerts to peak in an hour and a forty-five minutes-- kind of fast for DOI, by all accounts, but not totally aberrant.


It's now T+13 hours from dosing and I feel mostly baseline. Some mild visual distortion persists and I still get pleasant colors with tactile sensation (e.g.: red feels warm) in CEVs. Mildly elevated emotionally, but mentally baseline, aside from the renewed sense of wonder, etc. that is the aftermath of most good trips.


Accounts in "the literature," such as it is, have put duration of such doses at 2 and sometimes 3 days. I'm not feeling anything remotely like that. I'd almost feel cheated based on some of the reports I've read, had it not been a totally amazing trip.


If you're out there and still experimenting with the little brother who feels neglected ("Everyone wants to hang out with my cool older brother, just because he's an M.D."), or if you stockpiled your Doomsday bunker with 19 grams of DOI and need some casual reassurance: this dose won't kill you, nor will it reduce you to total lunacy any moreso than the brutal war with the machines that drove you to ground in the first place. I cannot guarantee that you will not die of some bizarre form of RC-related cancer in the future (and can you see the headlines? "WAR ON DRUGS CLAIMS VICTIMS THIRTY YEARS AFTER THE BATTLE"), but the radiation-blasted landscape you will emerge to from your humble shelter will probably play its own role.


I have about 20mg of this substance left. If I can get an appropriately long weekend after I've given myself time to recuperate, I'd like to push the dosage to 12mg. Has anyone else experienced such short onset and (relatively) short duration from this chemical?

For those who have used both DOC and DOI, would you mind comparing the two for me?  I have only used DOI once, when I had a lot of tolerance from using DOC too much, so I never got a good feel for it.  I love DOC... it's warm and strong and the plateau makes me feel outrageously euphoric.  Does DOI have that same characteristic?  I have used DOM a few times and it seems to lack that euphoric plateau stage for me.  Half of what I'm looking for in a DOX is the euphoric plateau stage from which to integrate the experience and just plain enjoy myself.

DOC at the 4mg range is a nice mellow euphoric, but slightly psychedelic experience for me. I like it, even though it lasts a bit long.


DOI is just a complete hell hole. Dark and violent. Super speedy. I couldn't imagine eating 8.5mg![8o](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eek.gif) Nuts....I was ready to go to the hospital from my heart rate resting at 168bpm.

I've never tried any other DOXes, but I never had anything remotely like that from DOI, and I did it several times (went through around 100mg of it). If I had a choice between DOI and DOC or something I'd try the DOC, but I'd definitely stock up on DOI again. It'd definitely be in my personal Magical Half Dozen.

i read thru this whole thread and no one really gives a definite answer. Does anyone know the full solubility of DOI in distilled H20 or Everclear? I'm about to try and dissolve 500mg in 50ml of dH20 and would really rather not screw it up by having to rework my acid-math if it doesn't fully dissolve.

Am getting some "LSD" blotters that I know contain DOI.

They are of a moderate strength. Usually need 2 for a strong trip.


Just wondering how many I should use after mushrooms the previous night.

How much cross-tolerance will occur?

If any one knows.

^ There will be a considerable amount of cross-tolerance when you take psychedelics two days in a row. It is difficult to say how much exactly, but if you usually need 2 hits for a strong trip (probably 2mg per hit), I'd say go with 3. DOI seems to have quite a steep dose/response curve, so no need to take it too much higher (double the dosage would probably be an overkill). Also, due to the long duration of this one, it will always be possible to take an additional hit if you're not satisfied with the level the initial dose takes you.

^ Yes, but not significantly IMO, since DOI is so slow-acting, and due to it's extreme dose-response curve you won't have to redose insane amounts to get to the desired level. This is different with things like LSD, where redosing is usually pretty much a complete waste of substance.

**DOI I need some help**


my cat should have 100mg of doi comming and has some questions. Most dosages he read was 2-3 mg.His plan is to dissolve all 100mg into 50ml of water so 1ml/2mg. For at home use he was planning on using a syringe but he is wondering about laying it on items to bring out with him when he parties. My cat does party alot. So household thing would hold 1ml of liquid than dry out and be able to carry. I was thinking sugar cubes but I wasnt sure if 1ml would melt the cube, plus its hard to bring places, id have to keep em in a plastic container.


Anyone have any other ideas on things to lay it on.


Also anyone have any experence with DOI? How are the effects and how long do they last.

Lots of info about DOI in the Big and Dandy DOI thread... I'm merging this post into it, so review it for info.


As for your question, 1mL is actually quite a bit of liquid for laying on items...it would definitely melt a sugar cube.  I recommend just using the syringe.  Alternative, you can dilute down to 10mg/mL, as long as your syringe is a good one that can measure by .1mL, and drop that onto a subar cube or something.  I doubt .1mL would make much of a dent in a sugar cube or pretty much anything else.

^ I've never had any body load on it. The only physical effect I get is peripheral stimulation, but that is similar to the body high I get with most psychedelics. It is perhaps a bit stronger and more annoying than with other substances I've tried, difficult to sit still etc, but nothing unexpected from an amphetamine really.

My first trials with DOI came with an "invisible collar" sensation. I felt like my neck was being choked by a collar that I couldn't see for a lot of the trip. This is due to vasoconstriction.


I never felt the other body load symptoms that I feel from lysergic acid amides.

No body load from LSD, but the ones found in seeds give me intense cramps and muscle spasms, in addition to the invisible collar and chest tightness. At immersive doses, DOI has only given me the invisible collar set of symptoms out of the possible vasoconstrictive body load symptoms I've experienced on LSAs.

OKay. I was just curious, i have a chance to try this substance but for a price. My last substance I was using was 2c-e and oral admin. was just horrible at higher doses. I felt stinging, cramps, extreme anxiety and very speedy. If I am going to get something Id like something more similar to LSD and shrooms which gave me no negative bodyload but more of a "high"

if only abtaining doc was that easy. Thanks for you input. Have you had expierience with 2c-e? if so, how much different is the body load? (doi vs 2c-e) Also, doi rectal admin? I enjoyed 2c-e rectaly but could only try small doses with my last batch so never got a full on ++ or +++ from them.

I have tried both 2C-E and DOI, I'd say their body load is completely different, 2C-E is yucky in the stomach while I noticed no such effects from DOI. They are both somewhat stimulating, DOI more so, but that's pretty much it IME. Of course I've only taken DOI up to 4mg, there will probably be more physical side-effects at higher doses (Coolio mentioned vasoconstriction for example), but overall I find it's pretty benign physically, somewhat dirty stimulation aside. I've also heard people reporting headaches, but personally have never experienced anything like that.

DOI and 2C-E body load are completely different. I don't get any body load from 2C-E other than nausea and vomiting. The body high is similar to 2C-C or 2C-T-2. With DOI, I just get that 'invisible collar', but it comes with an incredible MDMA-like body high.

Wow.


I finally took my first dose of DOI on Saturday night in celebration of the solstice, after sitting on it for 6 months, and had one of the most amazing times of my life.  I'm very eager to repeat the experience soon, as my summer will be hopefully getting pretty busy in a few weeks with work.


I was wondering how long it takes for DOI tolerance to go away.  Would I have to increase my dosage at all if I were to repeat my experiment again next weekend, one week after my initial dose?


Thanks for the help everyone!

I'd wager a week is enough time for the physical tolerance to go down enough to have an experience of similar intensity.

3mg barely gave threshhold effects, which could still be felt and seen 48+ hrs later.  i wish the DOx series were more standard in their doses instead of being all over the fucking place for different people.

I love it. Starts getting nice 5-6mg snorted best around 10mg snorted in two bumps 45min apart. Could be way too much for some.


Is there someone on bluelight who selects people who are having or about to have mystical experiences and the talks to that person about it? Or did I imagine that? Or is there a true spirituality section with knowledge straight from the other side that rarely opens?

3mg can be threshhold for me as well, and I've tried 3 or 4 batches of DOI. 3mg of DOC is more than enough, but with DOI I prefer the 6-8mg or higher doses.

Maybe this isnt a great idea, so what do you think about taking xanax when you want to come down?

2 years ago i took two windowpanes that contained DOI. I had +4 trip that rolled in that realm for 8 hours, with no depth perception and a maelstrom of the most beautiful but the scariest visuals ive ever had.


about 8 hours in i thought i had peaked but it just kept getting stronger felt like i was free falling in a different universe. Thought my eyes were gonna melt and my head was gonna be fucked till i died. 


My buddy who came over after i called him and begged him to come over cause i was not gonna have control of the situation very soon gave me 4 xanax bars. I took them felt better hour and a half later the last thing I remember was laying on my bed marveling the fact my floor had turned into a river and everything was flowing outside. 


I then blacked out and then sometime later that night i regained awareness of myself and i was opening the refridgerator. 


Craziest drug expereince ive had.


xanax is a good thing to have around when these situations arrise.

Yea, I know exactly what you mean. IT's not truely psychedelic, people think DOI is psychedelic just because there are visuals. They aren't even an extension of your mind, it's just synthetic sensory overload.

What I mean is that DOI and DOC always give me a synethetic visuals and feeling. It doesn't even feel like it's being created by my mind, rather it is being created by excess dopamine and serotonin pumping in my brain. It feels like ampethamines rather than a true psychedelic.


I prefer LSD if I want to rearrange my world and see how silly western society is and see some truth in the universe. LSD's visuals and feelings feel more natural and are truly from my mind.


LSD is the only chemical where you can look at your friends face and think "i want him to look like a space lizard" and then it will happen, whatever your idea is can come to life in a very creative and beautiful, tripped out way. LSD truly shows how powerful your mind is and this is why it's considered the most mind expanding psychedelic.


Not the most powerful psychedelic, **the most mind expanding.**


I remember trying to see if I could change my envirement by using my mind on DOB and DOC. All I could do was focus in on the boring visuals but I couldn't change their character even with thoughts. Whenever I looked at my friend's face it wasn't melting or morphing, rather it was just kinda shifting around violently but it wasn't anything special. YES, it was intense. It felt more intense than LSD but it was lacking the creative magic that is coming from within.


My opinion will never change, these substances haven't offered me anything except distress.

...But it's still just that - *your* OPINION. I respect your strong relationship with LSD, but saying "this is why it's considered the most mind expanding psychedelic" (by whom?) is kind of ridiculous. Many people would agree with your assessment, and many wouldn't (myself included). 


Basically, you come across as someone who is completely convinced that they hold the Truth of the situation, and doesn't have a shred of doubt otherwise. Which is a really tricky position to put yourself in. Standing on a soapbox makes it easier to have the ground kicked out from underneath you ![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif)


I don't mean to go on the offensive, but claiming that DOx and such are inherently worthless shit seems to be a subtly passive aggressive way of suggesting that those who find value in these substances are deluded or don't know what they're talking about. Which isn't correct.


Or maybe my mind just hasn't been expanded properly yet 8)

From my experiences with the chemicals myself and others around me who have taken them, DOX can really screw with your mind in a psychotic kinda way.


I've known 2 people who went insane for 2 months after taking mimic LSD blotters containing DOx.


I was also a guy who had a wonderful outlook and then took DOX and for a few weeks after that I lost touch with what I really valued about life.


Now I used LSD again to regain my sanity.


I am just planting seeds, my opinions so people can maybe think "well damn, maybe I need to chill out on the DOx for a while I sorta agree this stuff is really messy"


I don't think I know it all. Mushrooms and LSD prove that to me everytime.


What's ironic though, is the only time I ever felt that I knew everything was on a DOX(Mainly DOC and DOB). 


Crazy stuff ![:!](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/argh.gif)

^^Well, we agree that most people should not have access to DOx, that they do indeed have a psychotic character, and that LSD is the safer and healthier option. I also get very nasty vibes from DOB (but DOM is glorious). 


So keep planting seeds... many people could benefit, no doubt... but please don't demean the experiences of others who approached these chemicals with humility and shamanic intention and were gifted with something genuinely beautiful and pure...

What?  DOI does not "deplete the body of chemicals."  The reason that one feels exhausted after a DOI experience is related to the duration--being *awake* for 24-36 hours is exhausting, let alone having an intense psychedelic experience for that long.  But this has nothing to do with "being depleted of chemicals."

Technically, LSD is much more likely to trigger a manic psychotic reaction in those with an underlying susceptibility than DOI.  While any psychedelic compound can theoretically cause an aggravation of a disorder like schizophrenia, the fact that LSD is an agonist at dopamine D1/2/4 receptors makes it more likely to trigger mania/delusions than a pure 5-HT2 receptor agonist.


*Physiologically*, LSD is a much safer and healthier option--drugs do not get much more physiologically benign than LSD at therapeutically active doses.  And I also got nasty effects from DOB, but never with any of the other 2,5-dimethoxy-amphetamines.

I am pretty sure DOx work on dopamine if not more than LSD. But all drugs work on dopamine to an extent, it may be as an effect of the way we're feeling. Who knows.


DOx depletes your body of serotonin temporarily if I am correct, that's why DOx's tend to produce very intense euphoria and MDMA-like qualities and produce more of a "crash" than mushrooms or LSD. Mushies and LSD leave me feeling tired the next day but not crashed out, I love the afterglow.


LSD is not considered a euphoriant, it can be but that's up to the tripper and the set/setting. For some people a comfortable state of chaos is not euphoric, that's what LSD causes especially at higher doses.

How would they do that when they are not serotonin releasers, but instead serotonergic agonists?

No, I'm sorry but this is completely erroneous.  DOI is a selective 5HT2A/C agonist and has a low (if much of any) affinity for the dopamine receptor.

It has no inherent dopamine/norepinephrine/serotonin releasing properties as far as I know, too.  [5HT2A agonists are known to facilitate dopamine release while antagonists can prevent release. For 5HT2B/C, antagonism can facilitate DA release.](http://www.nature.com/npp/journal/v26/n3/abs/1395776a.html)


It's never been known to deplete serotonin, like pretty much all other 5HT2A/C agonists that don't have monoamine releasing properties.  It's been pretty well studied as a selective radioligand, too.

No more than 3mg.  One of my friends who really liked DOC around 6-8mg had a truly frightening experience where time started travelling backwards and then forwards but in fast forward instead of normal with 5mg.  Which sounds kind of really interesting but he was freaked out.

What other DOXs have you tried?  The DOX class has some of the most impressive visuals of any psychedelic, IMO, and a very full-on trip.  But among DOI, DOB, DOC, and DOM, I find DOI to have the blandest visuals and the least psychedelic mindstate.  DOI also has a strong stimulation and bodyload, which make it less than ideal.  You can take DOC pretty high and have it be pretty benign on the body, and DOM seems to be benign on the body at practically any dose.  DOI is definitely easier on the body than DOB though.


I agree though about the aural hallucinations.  DOI seems to have a very strong auditory component.

ive had friends mix MDMA with DOC and they loved it. Comparable to a candy flip.


Ive taken DOI only once at 1mg. i wouldnt describe what i experienced as a trip. It was a +. 

I felt a very nice stimulation and euphoria comparable to ~30mg of amphetamine. It added a nice music appreciation and just made the day a happy and fun one (it was also my first time visiting Alex Greys CoSM).


Ill have my next go at 2mg and see where that leads me.


I find i dont enjoy DOx's in higher doses. Well the only one ive tried a high dose of is DOC (6mg) and although the trip was great fun it was nothing i couldnt get from LSD and the body load and puking a experienced was excrutiating. 


So i think i may enjoy DOx's in low doses as a psychedelic enhancer to a day.


And i still have DOM to try...:D


so many psychs to try how does one decide? i usually get too flustered and just end up eating LSD, lol.

Hey, I'm just starting to learn about the DOx chemicals... Is there any addiction/habituation/abuse potential? Are there things I should be concerned about, other than the usual concerns with other psychedelics like LSD and psilocybe?

Not really.


The biggest concerns are keeping your dose reasonable and being prepared for the 30 hours you're going to be high.  Dose early in the day and don't expect to sleep very long that night, if at all.  They also tend to be rougher on the body than other psychedelics, DOI had a really strong body load for me.  1-1.5mg is a good starting place for DOI, my friend compared 1mg to 100mg of MDA, just for a really long time.

Well, DOI is a potent vasoconstrictor, so I'd say a lot is very dangerous. I wouldn't go above, say 6mg. Anyone else like to comment on this? 


For a mind-cleanse, I'd go with something less... researchy... Like Mushrooms, LSD, or DMT or Mescaline...

with no tolerance, 6mgs would almost definetely be all you would need of the material for a mind cleanse.  4mgs is a very intense mind cleansing trip for me even with a bit of tolerance.

Anyone have experience with different routes of admin?

I see some speaking of snorting DOI, how did that go? Hopefully it isn't as painful as snorting a 2C.

Has anyone got experience with rectal or IV admin? Dosage differences or come up/down time differences of particular interest.

I wouldnt IV DOI unless you're extremely experienced. The DOx compounds are extremely potent and intense, so IVing even a super low dose would blast you into a new world in such an extreme manner that the potential for things going wrong is mighty high.


Not to mention the fact that it'd become extremely dose sensative, and with a chem that's already dose sensative, it'd be very hard to guage the right amount to be safe and comfortable.

Good advice for sure but it does leave my questions unanswered.

I'm not looking to dive in the deep end. Hoping to get some experienced advice to help address the points you've raised.

Dose for IV might well be quite low then again it may not be, I'm not sure of the oral bioavailability of DOI or any other ROA for this chem.

Depending on what an IV dose should be it may well require sensitive, calibrated scales. Even oral doses need fairly good ones though.


Does anyone know of DOI research on people? My googling didn't work so good.

I know it's a well researched chem but I'm unsure on human studies.


Any help or more points of concern are most welcome.

I tried 1mg of pure DOI ! And it's always pretty strong to me ! I'm very sensitive to every psychedelics but i'm rather sensitive to DOI ! Very sensitive to this chemical ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


1mg for me -> 14h of tripping with wall breathing, mind fuck, fast heart beat and crazy stuff ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)


2mg or 3mg will kill me ! :D  (maybe because of my skinny profile)


Peace Out !


I also saw DOI blotter but afraid to touch it since i don't know the dosage on it ! ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I wanted to take a minute to let everyone know in each of the substance Big and Dandies about the community project of the PD forum which has been being worked on for the past 2 years or so, the Psychedelic Effects Profile survey.  This survey asks you a number of questions, starting with the substance taken, the dose, the method of administration, other substances (non-psychedelic) ingested during the trip, and set and setting, and then it goes on to ask about a variety of specific effects, and you can select whether or not you experienced them and if so, the intensity level of that effect on a 5-point scale.


Thank you for your help with this!  For this to be of any use whatsoever, we need as many responses as we can possibly get, so please take it as many times as you have time for, for as many substances as you have had proper trips on.  We want to gather the full range of effects possible so feel free to take it for positive as well as negative experiences, for earth-shattering and average.  Each time taking the survey is for a single trip on a single substance - no combinations please, as it taints the data for each substance.  In the future I may make another survey for combinations.  The survey takes about 5 minutes to get through so it's not too much of your time.


For further discussion of this project, please see the stickied thread at the top of the forum that starts with "Community Project".  To take the survey, please click on this link: [http://freeonlinesurveys.com/rendersurvey.asp?sid=hvw6fx9mmvzz82l599169](http://freeonlinesurveys.com/rendersurvey.asp?sid=hvw6fx9mmvzz82l599169)

Sure.  Just no one's posted in it in a while. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  Do you have anything to bring up for discussion about DOI?

The first 6-8 hours for me on this stuff is creative fury.  After that tho I would start to get a headache. Clonazepam always solved that sort of head ache best. Sometimes I had them, sometimes I resorted to84% kavalactone kava kava pills, which help but kava always seems to augment phenethylamines for me, which wasn't always what I wanted after the first 12 hours. Recently I've dicsovered that honokiol 98% powder works nearly as effective on that sort of headache for me, so I have been tempted to try my old stash o DOI out again and see if it helps with the face/head ache thing I get from being stimulated for so long...it's a great first half of the experience...it's just winding down on it is tough for me. Def need the next day maybe 2 off. The time frame on this one makes it tough...but I also been wondering how well 2c-c would merge into the second half of the experience for me too...seems like it would boost the areas that were achy and tensed out with some body glow and renewed psychedelic vigor to help ride out the DOI residual effects. I guess I will have to find out  for myself one day soon...

If you do, please report!  I'm interested in how 2C-C mixes with it as well because 2C-C seems to augment other psychedelics in a unique way.


I once combined 2C-I with DOC after about 8 hours on it and it really worked quite well as a booster and body high increaser.

I guess I'll post my thoughts on DOI.  I had 50 mg to play with.  I didn't really like it that much.  There was much more stimulation than psychedelia for me.  I don't know if my DOI was weak or what but I needed a lot more than the doses listed in pihkal to lift off.  I once took 10 mg and then 3 hours later 4 mg more and still wasn't happy with where I was at. 


EDIT:  Hmmm... well I was thinking about this and my material was definitely active at the 1 -2 mg range.  In fact I took it at that dose a couple times and just went about my day.  Those couple days I did that were probably my favorite experience with DOI.  No visuals, just a slight change in perception and some stimulation.


The stimulation was so much at times it reminded me of taking too much MDMA or Adderall and not being able to focus on anything. I couldn't read a paragraph or even think.  Very scatterbrained.


Visuals would last about 8 hours for me and then the rest would just be the stimulation and the body high.  My muscles would be very tense and aching by the end of the experience.


I liked DOC much, much better.  DOC was much more psychedelic.  I felt much more creative energy flowing through me on DOC.  On DOI I just felt rather stupid.  After 4 trips or so I gave the rest of my stash away.

Yeah, low doses with DOXs are really great I find.  DOC is by FAR the best one for this.  It makes a day-long glowing state that just feels so zen and wonderful and content and loving (this is DOC).  Plus DOC is much more psychedelic overall, and especially at higher doses.


I agree with your assessment of DOI.  For me, it made me feel kind of... like a super-generic trip without the revelations, just the feelings.  And once it gave me a really nasty and frightening racing heartbeat that had me really worried.  Not one of my favorites and I doubt I'll ever have it agai.


DOC, on the other hand... is my favorite psychedelic for non-spiritual purposes (recreation and/or working through life problems), and it's also up there for spiritual purposes at higher dosages.

I have questions about DOI.

I'm a bit unexperimented with high dose but anyways i'm pretty skinny and i wan't to know if DOI is active @0.5mg and how the trip look like ? 


From how many x mgs DOI brings visuals ? And also how about the bodyload ? Is it "dangerous" ? And from xx mgs the bodyload can be feeled ?


Sorry for my stupid question, but my last DOI trip was a long time ago and don't remember the effects and the dosage.


And + i'm skinny and don't want to harm myself with DOI ! :D


Thank you

DOI is definitely active at .5mg, but it's not really a trip at that dosage... more like an all-day serotonergic stimulant. I like low-dose DOXs very much but DOC is the best one.  In my experience DOI is mediocre.  But some people like it the best so your mileage may vary. 


The dosage for visuals varies.  I'd say 2mg would start it, and 2-3mg would be a standard full-n trip dose.  Always start low because DOI lasts a LONG time, easily up to 30 hours (over a whole day, for real).


DOI can be dangerous because it increases heart rate more than many of the DOXs.  I once had my heart race so fast I was scared for a couple of hours, when I was trying to go to sleep.  I took 4-5mg over the course of the day,so it was a pretty high dose, but I have taken 12mg of DOC over the course of a day without a racing heart at all.

I wouldn't refer to it as bodyload at such a low dose, as bodyload, to me at least, implies something negative or something to have to deal with.  At such a low dose, it's more like a light, psychedelic-esque stimulation and sometimes mood elevation.

DOI at a light psychedelic dose isn't as strong as LSD but the visuals are certainly very lucid.


I saw like cartoons on the wall animating as if there was a projector projecting it.


It wasn't that trippy like looking at a wall on LSD but it had me laughing and the most intense the visual looked the more weird/hilarity of the situation.


DOI at psychedelic doses is kinda sedating in a way, makes u wanna lay there doing nothing. Sometimes it's kinda like a weaker MDMA.


Kinda got bored with it, trip with people to make it fun.


Unlike LSD, most DOX are better with people IMO or else you get sketched out kinda like speed lol.

how do you mean "weird" ?


in my experience, all trip drugs give "weird" tactile sensations-- shrooms gave me the sensation that i was TRANSFORMING into a mushroom... 2C-E gave me the feeling that every point on my body was multiplied by ten (so i could feel a hundred blankets on top of me, all rubbing deliciously against my skin...)


have fun with the tactile sensations! take a warm shower or bath! play with a fuzzy toy! chew some minty gum! HOORAY!

In addition to being dangerous, it sounds like a pretty good way to make yourself miserable for an extended period of time.  Seems like you'd either come down on coke while sill on DOI, which would probably be bad.  Or if you don't run out of coke, you'll do enough to put your health (& possibly life) in serious jeopardy, as DOI in combo with other stimulants is very ill advised.

DOI is my favourite psychedelic, it beats LSD hands down in my opinion. For me  it produces a feeling of incredible empathy and a feeling of being at peace unlike anything i've experienced on any other drug. 


In my trials with DOI I did find the dose response curve to be very variable, I tried it at doses between 1mg and 10mg and I found that my experiences with doses of 8, 9 and 10mg were no were near as intense as my life changing 7mg trip. 


I've managed to procure 500mg of DOI after searching for a supplier for years, hopefully tomorrow I shall be taking 3mg if all goes to plan.

**never again**


Iv tried DOI once, but id say NEVER again. I took a capsul's worth, the guy said it was 5mg. A light tan coating of powder inside a capsul.


DOI is insane, and that is coming from somebody who loves psychdelics, Iv taken LSD hundreds of times, same with mushrooms. 


It was wayy to strong of a body load, I couldnt walk, or more, I could, but had a card time consiously remembering how to.


I did see some both very beautiful, others deeply terrifying things. 


The entire physical reality dissappeared, and saw that the rave was all of a sudden set at the backdrop of a crystal castle in the sun. I could walk outside onto the balcony of the castle and run my fingers through the solar flare/nuclear fire, as if I was touching a warm breeze, as my body was nolonger physical, but made of pure energy. I just calmy watched it flow thru my fingers.


Only to wake up on the floor, with my heart RACING.


Everything was really melty, and I felt me merge into walls, lazers, sound light.


Somewhere in the eveing a bunch of ravers pushed me into the bathroom, and locked door, I completely frrrreakked out. The lights were on and all the walls were really white. I got extreamly claustrophobic, and thought that room was the only area of existance, that is was some kind of inter-dementional jail cell, for which reality ceased to exist outside of its walls with no escape.


As the DJ put on the dubb step, I felt the walls of the bathroom poke at me with every wobbbbbble beat, hands and faces started coming through the white walls, laughing at me, started aggressively ripping my clothes off and touching me sexually.


It was one of the most intense fucked up tripps every, my girlfriend found me in the bathroom writhing on the floor and screaming , she was kinda able to calm me down, it wasnt helping.


I miss a few ours of memory, watching patterns, till all of the suden the music cut off, and the cops came into the rave, the DJ was still using my berhinger mixer. I wanted as him to get off my mixer, cuz of the coppers, we had to go, but when I looked at the DJ, his eyeballz started falling out of his sockets, his fingers were falling off onto my mixer knobs, and maggots started coming out of his nose n shit.


My girlfriend was able to get me and my mixer home. Still tripping the next day, everything looked very "circus" or "carnival" like, with strange "funny" colors.


Neverless I am never taking DOI again.

Did anything become of this? I too am interested in low dose DOI. Up to 1 mg as just a creative tool sounds quite interesting, does anyone have any experience with this type of use?

Nah, there's a lot of DOI around these days. If someone would ask me if it's worth a try I'd tell them to get 2c-i instead, or DOC if they absolutely have to have substituted amph.

i preferred DOI in many ways.  i used to be pretty into amphetamine and other pharmaceutical stimulants, though... so perhaps i just really liked the stimulation aspect.

DOI is different from 2C-I, and usually DOx of his counterpart 2C-x.

Quote from old and Overgrown DOC thread (Tryptamine Dreamer I think)

Back to when I was 3 or 4 years old. The DOC trip did it a little better than DOI. Both of those trips were dysphoric, sometimes extremely. The DOC trip also caused feelings and thoughts that my mind was being damaged and violated. That was with 5mg.

Low dose DOI as a study aid did not work out as well as I had  hoped. Live and learn I guess, or not learn as it appears. Cognitive effects are hampered by the visual effects of electricity over field of vision. 700 ug were taken at approximately 740 pm and would up giving restless energy until around 5 am (rough guess, till going), second 700 ug taken at 3 am to keep me going until inevitable crash.  


Very stimulating in an anxious way but I would like to explore higher doses with alcohol, seems to be able to be very seductive in that aspect. 


In short low dose DOI is a failure, over analysis of every detail of everything with no amp smoothness to it and jumbling of numbers and words and tiredness. Do not recommend, this post looks like shit.

I could imagine the DOx's are probably a bit strong for study-aid uses, though might try low dose DOC myself one day. 


Have you tried it at higher doses? Do you still get the negative effects at higher doses? I'm interested in this chemical and trying to get a feel for other peoples experience with it first.

I was interested also in hearing a bit about it from others but it seems to be like everything else we like to research, all the subjective/objective shit until you try it and get it ha. 


I underestimated them even at the low doses of 700 mcg, way too trippy to be able to study. I myself haven't tried higher doses but can see why people hesitate. I can sympathize with the comparisons to 2c-i over-stimulation. Something about my body can feel the presence of the iodine in my body as opposed to chlorine. This is definitely the grayer type feeling of 2c-i mixed with strong amp energy.


.7 mg of DOI felt like 20 or so mg of amphetamine and a overlaying feel of persistent electricity. This goes coupled with tiredness and stimulation. My heart and breathing as well as body movements were stimulated more than normal and it was hard to sit still. Went for a great walk for half an hour studied fairly well until visuals started interfering. I would say that if you can take a nice trip of LSD and amphetamine stimulation you will like this. 


Mind you its not on the level of LSD at this dosage but I would say the feel is closely towards the amphetamine side with the weird tinges. 


Come ups were interesting, felt effects very soon but was a slow gradual come up, very hard to describe really. Can't think of anything I would enjoy really having a longer length than this in all honesty, I mean shit I am at the same relative area 12 hours later, this seemed to me to be more of an endurance challenge than anything.


I would give overall first impressions as it being difficult but very analytic and rewarding. Can for sure bring the experimenter to negative space but I needed the cry I think. Obviously this report shows the amped part of this substance. Talking for days and the screen is funny as shit.

Doses were oral and found on (1.4 mg) blotter

This should be awarded at least a badge or a scar, I don't know which. I would warn others to be very cautious of DOI, lessons are learned in many ways. Apparently mine is that I should be appreciative of small graces and accept everything else. Tough lessons indeed, but ones I have been running from for a few months. 


Now if I could just find the volume or the off switch for this ha. Humbling to say the least, I guess this is what is meant buy the high affinity for the receptor, like a fucking stick in my eye. Feel like I have been excreting my life waste for a day straight now, give me sleep.

Probably +1 some 27 hours later, 22ish I guess because of redose but still 10 too long compared to what I wanted but fuck what I want its what I need and have to manage. First post was lost to science I guess, said it better than this but just as well. 


Something along the long lines of 'only LSD made me feel this way for the first time in the manner in which I was pushed and elevated forward' (can't remember how I said it, such is life). The feeling is exactly the same as pure anxiety, fear and excitement all at once. All constant and pure and magnificent. The introspection was some of the most honest and least sugar-coated  I have felt and I can't seem to be sure where to go with it.

Probably gonna try this as a study aid tonight.

Was planning on taking 1.5-1.8 mg, but based on the reports below I might wanna back down a bit to 0.9-1.1-ish.

Will give an update on the experience  if I decide to drop it and am back down again. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


Any last-minute advice is more than welcome, probably gonna prep my capsule in about 4 hours...

While LSD is more empathic, DOI definitely beats it in intensity. I had DOI before acid and, with all the hype surrounding LSD, was a bit disappointed with the trip. These days, I'd still take acid over DOI any time.

I recently had my 2nd experience on DOI.

The first was a trial dose of 1mg (ingested in 3 times) inside the Reina Sofia in Madrid during the summer. Guernica and Dali took a whole deeper meaning.


My 2nd dose was around 2mg. I found this trip to be way more intense. It came very much in long waves.

If I focussed on manual tasks or reading (could read easily), the trip would disappear. I could feel back to baseline for an hour whereas suddenly it hit again at full force.


After smoking weed on 12th, I got launched further into hyperspace. Very unreal glowing colors. It seemed like all edges of objects becamen very thick lines.

This one goes very wel with meditation. You can feel every muscle of your body becoming tense or relaxed at random.

It brought me to places I hadn't visited for ages. Very reminiscent of early full blown acid trips I have had.


I could sleep easily at 14h, after effects next days weren't enjoyable. This experience filled me.


I won't be using psychedelics for quite some time now.

Since I've got a quite distorted relation with LSD after some abuse. I won't let this happen with DOI...


Respect the substance. Imo deserves a spot right next to acid

Use it on spare occasions...


Enjoy

My post above was very positive about DOI

This was the feeling I had on the end of the trip.


I must say though there were some things that bothered me.


annotation: I took the trip during the night, and then went back to sleep.


Maybe I was still very tired, but when I woke up, I didn't feel like waking up at all. I would just lay in bed for a few hours. Getting up to get some water was very difficult. 


It felt like my muscles were VERY tense and were burning up inside.

Also my veins looked narrower than normal. Vasoconstriction? (didn't find anything about it though)

These symptoms subsided some time after. 

Although walking was still a bit clumsy. It seemed like my legs couldn't bend very well.


Would doing intense sport on DOI be dangerous in some kind? Like running or martial arts... Given that I drink plenty of water before and during the trip?

I didn't do it because my muscles felt so weird.


I read some ppl had similar negative body effects. What could be the cause?

(Not all the body muscle tension effects were negative in my case)

^^^ did you eat at all while on the trip though?  going 24+ without eating is probably gonna cause muscle soreness, DOI or not.

At 22h I ate a large meal

After that I went out en went to sleep around 8'o clock in the morning

Woke up and took the dose around 11h. Then went back to sleep till 14h. After that, I stayed in bed feeling like a wreck.

Maybe I should have slept longer though...


I have to say the intense muscle soreness subsided a few hours after the trip. Although the clumsy walk stayed

I had no loss of appetite. Bread and water were ingested frequently during the day.

**DOI Consumption**


I took DOI a few days ago for the first time, im just sayin .5 didnt do much but leave a stange sort of naritive thought process in my mind, but i am thinking of experimenting with it in a higher dose once it becomes availible, truely, what are good doses for more experianced users, ive used acid several times, DMT 2 times, 2ce 4 times, dph, a good 40 times, dxm, 80-100 times, 5-MeO Dmt, once, and several LSA, morning glory, passion flower brews, along with my own chemically synthesized creations, mostly pathetic excuses for a psychoactive, but some ive found promissing, one left me in a state of confusion for weeks, Ive also tried MdMA, Opiate and amphetamine based, Psilocibon, large quantities, and Salvia.. i mighta missed some, but with someone of my experiance whats a good recomended dose for an amazing mindset, vissuals, and emotional state....?

DOI is an extremely potent drug, and tolerance to psychedelics is gone after 24-48 hours.


Wikipedia says oral doses of 1.5 to 3.0 mg is a "recreational dosage" but you may want to browse through this thread:

Tolerance to psychedelics is not gone after 24-48 hours. Wait at least a week for tolerance to fully subside, this is the standard rule.

I took 3mg without much exp. in psychs, it was ok. My friend took 6 by mistake, it was very strong in visuals, not much mindfuck. I'd say take 3 or 4 for the first time, if you are experienced, if you like to be on the stronger side than 4. More is too much by any means.

I don't think DOI is what you're looking for. For most people it isn't very clean and there can be quite a bit of mindfuck present with real doses.

Alexander Shulgin is not the end-all-be-all on subjective experiences. I'm just telling you, the majority of those who take DOI do not find it clean nor mentally benign. Personally, I did, but I appear to be an exception to the rule. DOC is MUCH more clean and mentally positive to a lot of people (and I find it very clean and positive as well) without such a long duration.

I have a batch of DOI blotters with supposedly 1.5mg. When I got them I tried one with no effects. About 5h after ingesting the first blotter I felt like it was save to take another one. I never felt any effects whatsoever. I wasn't a tiny bit stimulated and had no visuals from the second hit either. I could sleep normaly. 


Are those blotters bunk or could it be that I have a natural tolerance to DOI? 

The blotters are from a reputable vendor and I see a very light drop on them.


This was about a year ago, how long does DOI last when stored airtight without light?

I took 2c-e and 2c-c pretty much once every 2 weeks when I tried the DOI. 


Would it be a waste of DOI if I try it this weekend? I tripped on 40mg 2c-c and 1.5mg 25c-nbome last weekend. 

I never noticed an extreme tolerance with PEAs. Usually one week brake and I am good to go again without upping the dose exept with nbomes.

Who would have thought psychedelic could cause intense pain. My friend reported he could feel the nerves inside his teeth which caused some pain. Well mine went to the next level (I have very bad teeth).

I took 8.2mg. It started to kick in roughly hour after ingesting. Peaked in roughly 3 hours. Then I started to feel the nerves inside my teeth. From times I got sudden pain so strong I'd drop on my knees arch my back and look directly to the sealing only seeing white and hear very loud static sound that ripped my ears. Aside those pain attacks the trip itself was great. It blew out 3.2mg of 25D, 2mg 25I and 1.6mg of 25C out of the water. Lasted roughly 15 hours ![o_O](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f635.png). Don't think I'll try DOI again anytime soon. Though I do not regret taking it. 


sidenote: I recognize myself as masochistic person. My pain tolerance is nearly limitless as the endorphins normally kick in. But pain directly to the nerves... Fuck that. Also pain inside mouth is my worst nightmare. Fucking dentist's.

I am going to hopefully bring in the new years with a DOI trip, I just dropped 1.4 mg 15 min ago so I SHOULD be in for a long haul.


Here is the kicker...I am on anti-psychotics and may not feel a damn thing from this.


Schizophrenia is a really annoying illness in that the medicine keeping me from having delusions also keeps me from tripping. I have plenty of anti-psychotics to abort this trip if I so need to however I would like to at least experience some form of a trip before I turn myself back to boring and medicated.


I understand this post may not get liked by all due to me being schizophrenic and wanting to trip but it has been over a year and a half on these meds and I am desperate to feel some type of way besides flat. Time will tell if I feel anything at all or if I regret my choice but the choice has been made.

It didn't. 


Peripheral stimulation that made it a bit hard to sleep was the only thing noticed. It amazes me that something as strong as DOI won't be felt due to anti-psychotics. I expected to feel at least SOMETHING but no, didn't happen.

Hmmm...wonder if Salvia Divinorum would work.

The Kappa Opioid receptor it hits causes the psychedelic effects. That's a hell of a trip though, not for the faint of heart. Considering you are struggling with mental illness you really need to be careful taking drugs.


This is a harm reduction site, your mental health can get worse. Just try and be careful on this quest, i know you miss tripping and its difficult to give up. But considering my sister has severe schizophrenia, I've seen a person become more and more detached due to the use of psychedelics and dissociatives. Caught up in complex delusions of hell and damnation. She used to be skitzo effective, the drugs made it worse.


She struggles every day

I didn't care for DOI when I took it, it seemed rather generic in character but also very stimulating.  It didn't give me any euphoria or very interesting content.  I am going to give it a proper try sometime but it's low on my list - I do have some but there are a good number of things I'm going to do first.  I'm planning to do either DOPr or DOB soon.  Probably DOPr (I've taken a lower dose and felt that it didn't fully develop).  For me, DOC is still the best (out of DOC, DOET, DOF, DOI, DOiP, DOM and DOPr), it just has it all, everything I look for in a psychedelic and virtually nothing that I don't like (vasoconstriction is about the only thing I can think of).

DOI is one that I really want and am sad that I never picked up back in the day. It's not because I want to use it as a psychedelic–that sounds miserable–but because I want to nanodose it for systemic inflammatory issues. It sounds really promising for tamping down all kinds of systemic inflammation at a subpsychoactive level

Mind-blowingly amanzing, izo, thanks fro sharing !! Havent read past the abstract, but if it's 5HT2A-R activation alone that mediates the anti-inflammatory effect, then most psychedelics should share this property.


Of course, DOx are special in that they are full agonists at that receptor (IIRC?), so whether you need full agonism to bring out this effect is not clear to me.

I never found Doi to be anything special. Not  that visual or profound at regular doses. Did 4.5mg-5mg once and although the wide array of effects were considerably weak, while watching porn on cinemax back in 2007, I was getting to the point of climax just from watching. Very deep, virtual reality like or maybe synastasia like senses were making the porn automatically make me feel influenced by it to the point of  being overwhelmed. Kind of scary intense feeling. 4mg-5mg is overdose ime

Well yeah considering it's strong at like 2mg.  4-5mg is a very high dose.


However I agree, DOI doesn't seem to have anything special about it, subjective effects-wise, even though it's a strong drug.  DOC is so much better than it leaves DOI in the dust.

It's even broader than that, non-serotonergic psychedelics do stuff like this as well. Cannabinoids (especially THC) have an influence on the immune system. And salvia can be used to lessen the effects of inflammation too.

Would absolutely love to try this, alas doesn't seem to be at all common in Europe (specifically UK).


Have tried DOC (best drug I have experienced - incredible headspace), really would love to try DOM also.


What is the nature of the visual/headspace on DOI? Have read its quite dark, almost horror-ish, which tbf. sounds right up my street.

I have tried DOI a couple of times.  DOC is also (tied for) my favorite drug.  DOI is lacking compared to DOC, the headspace is much colder, and it is more stimulating.  It has some really nice visuals, but most of the trip is a lingering stimulation for even longer than DOC's duration.  I have talked to ma few people who prefer DOI to DOC but almost everyone greatly prefers DOC.


Actually I have tried DOC, DOM, DOF, DOiP, DOET, DOI, and DOPr, and of them all, DOC is far and away the best,  except for DOPr, DOPr is absolute gold as well, it's more intoxicating, more visual, more deeply psychedelic than DOC, but also literally twice the duration which is just a bit much.


DOM is not bad, but I find it a bit transparent... I can't ever seem to get a fully satisfying trip out of it.  I've taken it up to 10mg.  I found 10mg weaker than 2-2.5mg of DOC.  Some people seem to react more fully to DOM than I do, though.  DOM has almost no bodyload which is nice, and the duration is a bit lower, but the headspace isn't nearly as good as DOC, nor is the body high.


I am going to try DOB soon, I think I may like it almost as much as DOC/DOPr.  But haven't done it yet.

I found this on psychonauts wiki about DOI:

"

Besides its action as a [psychedelic](https://m.psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic), DOI has been shown to be an extremely potent inhibitor of tumour necrosis factor-alpha inflammation at picomolar concentrations in cell studies. TNF-alpha is an important target for research into degenerative conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and Alzheimer's disease where the disease process involves tissue damage through chronic inflammation. This could make DOI and other 5-HT2A agonists an entirely new area for development of novel treatments for these conditions.[[6]](https://m.psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DOI#cite_note-6)


DOI has also been shown to induce rapid growth and reorganization of dendritic spines and synaptic connections with other [neurons](https://m.psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurons), processes known to underlie neuroplasticity.[[7]](https://m.psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DOI#cite_note-7)"


Curious if anyone has tried using this at lower doses for nootropic potentiality.

**Theta:**


Here's a recent study (the full text) that really expands our knowledge of the relationship between psychedelics and anti-inflammatory effects, we've got a lot more to go on than just DOI now.


[Structure–Activity Relationship Analysis of Psychedelics in a Rat Model of Asthma Reveals the Anti-Inflammatory Pharmacophore](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acsptsci.0c00063)


> Psychedelic drugs can exert potent anti-inflammatory effects. However, anti-inflammatory effects do not appear to correlate with behavioral activity, suggesting different underlying mechanisms. We hypothesized that the distinct structural features of psychedelics underlie functionally selective mechanisms at the target 5-HT2A receptor to elicit maximal anti-inflammatory effects. In order to test this hypothesis, we developed a new rat-based screening platform for allergic asthma. Next, we investigated 21 agonists at the 5-HT2A receptor from the three primary chemotypes (phenylalkylamine, ergoline, and tryptamine) for their ability to prevent airways hyperresponsiveness as a measure of pulmonary inflammation. Furthermore, we assessed each drug for *in vitro* activation of the canonical signaling pathway, calcium mobilization, from the 5-HT2A receptor. We find that the drug 2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine (2C-H) represents the pharmacophore for anti-inflammatory activity and identify structural modifications that are either permissive or detrimental to anti-inflammatory activity. Additionally, there is no correlation between the ability of a particular psychedelic to activate intracellular calcium mobilization and to prevent the symptoms of asthma or with behavioral potencies. Our results support the notions that specific structural features mediate functional selectivity underlying anti-inflammatory activity and that relevant receptor activated pathways necessary for anti-inflammatory activity are different from canonical signaling pathways. Our results inform on the nature of interactions between ligands at the 5-HT2A receptor as they relate to anti-inflammatory activity and are crucial for the development of new 5-HT2A receptor agonists for anti-inflammatory therapeutics in the clinic that may be devoid of behavioral activity.

We've got one and a half blotters of DOI saved up, but unfortunately with that being all we've got, we're certainly not going to try to divide it up into tinier dosages to see the sub-psychedelic effect.

Back in the day, 20 or so years ago, I tried DOI and DOB. DOI was very cold and emotionless. I felt highly strung and anxious for the prolonged period of time. Going for a bike ride helped relieve the tension more than Diazepam. Overall I far preferred DOB. Who knows why, I felt it was much warmer. It’s been a long time and I wouldn’t bother every trying it again if presented with the opportunity to try it.

I am going to give it a proper try sometime but it's low on my list - I do have some but there are a good number of things I'm going to do first.  I'm planning to do either DOPr or DOB soon.  Probably DOPr (I've taken a lower dose and felt that it didn't fully develop).  For me, DOC is still the best (out of DOC, DOET, DOF, DOI, DOiP, DOM and DOPr), it just has it all, everything I look for in a psychedelic and virtually nothing that I don't like (vasoconstriction is about the only thing I can think of).

I don't believe DOI could ever touch DOB but it would be the crown to my DOx experimenting. But there are some good and positive reports around.

This could be very interesting in treating autoimmune and chronic inflammation disorders.


Does anyone know if any research has been done with other similar drugs, including non-amphetamine 5ht2 agonists. I am interested in DOB/DOC/DOM and psilocybin.

I don't know if similar research has been done, I have always been fascinated with the inflammation study(ies?) done on DOI, though.  I wonder if microdosing it could provide a 24 hour inflammation medication?  Obviously a psychedelic dose would have a pretty tremendous side effect profile.

Actually, David Nichols's son is doing research on the anti-inflammatory effects of 5-HT2A agonism. There was a pretty cool article that came out last year and they found 2C-H is the phenethylamine pharmacophore for anti-inflammatory effects.

Thanks for the link. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  Super interesting, if I'm reading it correctly, it's saying that 2C-H is an effective anti-inflammatory, but it is not psychoactive, meaning that the mechanism for reduction in inflammation is not tied to the cognitive effects of these substances.
