## Dosage & Duration

### Oral

**Dosage:**
- Threshold: 1 mg
- Light: 2 - 4 mg
- Common: 4 - 6 mg
- Strong: 6 - 12 mg
- Heavy: 12 mg +

**Duration:**
- Total: 8 - 10 hours
- Onset: 15 - 30 minutes
- Come up: 30 - 60 minutes
- Peak: 3 - 4 hours
- Offset: 3 - 4 hours
- After effects: 3 - 6 hours
**Fatal [overdose](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Overdose) may occur when [thienodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thienodiazepines) are combined with other [depressants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressants) such as [opiates](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opiates) , [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) , [barbiturates](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Barbiturates) , [gabapentinoids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Gabapentinoids) , [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) or other [GABAergic substances](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GABA#GABA_receptors) .**
 
It is strongly discouraged to combine these substances, particularly in [common](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Common) to [heavy](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Heavy) doses.
**Deschloroetizolam** is a short-acting [psychoactive](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychoactive) substance of the [thienodiazepine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thienodiazepine) class which has been shown to produce [depressant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressant) , [anxiolytic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiolytic) , [sedative](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedative) , [hypnotic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hypnotic) , [muscle relaxant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_relaxant) , [anticonvulsant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anticonvulsant) and [amnesic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amnesic) effects. Deschloroetizolam, like [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) , binds to modulatory sites on the [GABA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GABA) receptors. Deschloroetizolam is closely related to [etizolam](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Etizolam) (Etilaam), [triazolam](/w/index.php?title=Triazolam&action=edit&redlink=1) (Halcion), and [alprazolam](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alprazolam) (Xanax). It is not prescribed and is not recognised as a controlled substance in many parts of the world, leading to its appearance within grey market [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) vendors in 2014.

Deschloroetizolam has a relatively fast onset of action and symptomatic relief. It is half as potent as its parent compound [etizolam](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Etizolam) with a duration which is twice as long. It also has a similar bioavailibility and a similar time to onset in comparison to the parent drug. 2mg of deschloroetizolam is thought to be of similar potency to 10mg of [diazepam](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Diazepam) .

Similar to [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) , [the sudden discontinuation of thienodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thienodiazepine#Discontinuation) can be potentially dangerous or life-threatening for individuals using regularly for extended periods of time, sometimes resulting in seizures or death. It is highly recommended to [taper](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Taper) one's dose by gradually lowering the amount taken each day for a prolonged period of time instead of stopping abruptly.

## Chemistry

Deschloroetizolam is a structural relative of [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) , whereby the benzene ring has been replaced by a thiophene ring, classifying it as a [thienodiazepine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thienodiazepine) . It differs structurally from its parent compound [etizolam](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Etizolam) through removal of the chlorine atom at the 2' position on the phenyl ring.

Deschloroetizolam contains a thiophene ring fused to a diazepine ring, which is a seven member ring with the two nitrogen constituents located at R 1 and R 4 . Thiophene is a five member aromatic ring with one sulfur atom. This forms the thienodiazepine core of deschloroetizolam. An ethyl chain is bound to this bicyclic structure at R 7 . Additionally, a phenyl ring is bound to this structure at R 5 . Deschloroetizolam also contains a methylated triazole ring fused to and incorporating R 1 and R 2 of its diazepine ring, classifying it as a thienotriazolodiazepine. Deschloroetizolam shares this fused triazole ring substitution with certain [benzodiazepine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine) drugs, called triazolobenzodiazepines, distinguished by the suffix "-zolam".

## Pharmacology

Thienodiazepines produce a variety of effects by binding to the benzodiazepine receptor site and magnifying the efficiency and effects of the neurotransmitter [gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA)](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GABA) by acting on its [receptors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Receptor) . As this site is the most prolific inhibitory receptor set within the brain, its modulation results in the [sedating](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedating) (or [calming effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety_suppression) ) of deschloroetizolam on the nervous system.

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation)** - In terms of energy level alterations, this drug has the potential to be extremely sedating and often results in an overwhelmingly lethargic state. At higher levels, this causes users to suddenly feel as if they are extremely sleep deprived and have not slept for days, forcing them to sit down and generally feel as if they are constantly on the verge of passing out instead of engaging in physical activities. This sense of sleep deprivation increases proportional to dosage and eventually becomes powerful enough to force a person into complete unconsciousness.
- **[Respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression)**
- **[Muscle relaxation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_relaxation)**
- **[Dizziness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dizziness)** ### Paradoxical effects
 
- Paradoxical reactions to [thienodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thienodiazepine) and [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) such as increased seizures (in epileptics), aggression, increased anxiety, violent behavior, loss of impulse control, irritability and suicidal behavior sometimes occur (although they are rare in the general population, with an incidence rate below 1%). These paradoxical effects occur with greater frequency in recreational abusers, individuals with mental disorders, children, and patients on high-dosage regimes. ### Cognitive effects
 
- The cognitive effects of deschloroetizolam can be broken down into several components which progressively intensify proportional to dosage. The general head space of deschloroetizolam is described by many as one of intense sedation and decreased inhibition. It contains a large number of typical [depressants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressant) cognitive effects. The most prominent of these cognitive effects generally include: 
- **[Amnesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amnesia)**
- **[Anxiety suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety_suppression)**
- **[Thought deceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_deceleration)**
- **[Analysis suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Analysis_suppression)**
- **[Disinhibition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Disinhibition)**
- **[Euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_euphoria)**
- **[Compulsive redosing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Compulsive_redosing)**
- **[Emotion suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Emotion_suppression)** - Although this compound primarily suppresses anxiety, it also dulls other emotions in a manner which is distinct but less intensive than that of [antipsychotics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antipsychotic) .
- **[Delusions of sobriety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions)** - This is the false belief that one is perfectly sober despite obvious evidence to the contrary such as severe cognitive impairment and an inability to fully communicate with others. It most commonly occurs at heavy dosages.
- **[Dream potentiation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dream_potentiation)**
### Experience reports

There are currently no anecdotal reports which describe the effects of this compound within our [experience index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Experience_index) . Additional experience reports can be found here:

- [Erowid Experience Vaults: Deschloroetizolam](https://www.erowid.org/experiences/subs/exp_Deschloroetizolam.shtml)

## Toxicity and harm potential

Deschloroetizolam likely has a low toxicity relative to dose. However, it is potentially [lethal](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression) when mixed with [depressants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressants) like [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) or [opioids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioids) .

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this drug.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

Deschloroetizolam is extremely physically and psychologically addictive.

Tolerance will develop to the sedative-hypnotic effects within a couple of days of continuous use. After cessation, the tolerance returns to baseline in 7 - 14 days. However, in certain cases this may take significantly longer in a manner which is proportional to the duration and intensity of one's long-term usage.

Withdrawal symptoms or rebound symptoms may occur after ceasing usage abruptly following a few weeks or longer of steady dosing, and may necessitate a gradual dose reduction. For more information on tapering from thienodiazepines in a controlled manner, please see [this guide](http://www.benzo.org.uk/manual/bzcha02.htm) .

[Thienodiazepine discontinuation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine#Discontinuation) is notoriously difficult; it is potentially life-threatening for individuals using regularly to discontinue use without tapering their dose over a period of weeks. There is also an increased risk of seizure following discontinuation of thienodiazepines. Drugs which lower the seizure threshold such as [tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol) should be avoided during withdrawal.

Deschloroetizolam presents cross-tolerance with all [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine) and [thienodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thienodiazepine) , meaning that after its consumption all thienodiazepines will have a reduced effect.

### Overdose

Thienodiazepine overdose may occur when a [thienodiazepine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thienodiazepine) is taken in extremely heavy quantities or concurrently with other depressants. This is particularly dangerous with other GABAergic depressants such as [barbiturates](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Barbiturate) and [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) since they work in a similar fashion, but bind to distinct allosteric sites on the GABA A receptor, thus their effects potentiate one another. Thienodiazepine increase the frequency in which the chlorine ion pore opens on the GABA A receptor while barbiturates increase the duration in which they are open, meaning when both are consumed, the ion pore will open more frequently and stay open longer . Thienodiazepine overdose is a medical emergency that may lead to a coma, permanent brain injury or death if not treated promptly and properly.

Symptoms of a thienodiazepine overdose may include severe [thought deceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_deceleration) , [slurred speech](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Language_suppression) , [confusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Confusion) , [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) , [respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression) , coma or death. Thienodiazepine overdoses may be treated effectively in a hospital environment, with generally favorable outcomes. Thienodiazepine overdoses are sometimes treated with [flumazenil](/w/index.php?title=Flumazenil&action=edit&redlink=1) , a GABA A antagonist , however care is primarily supportive in nature.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **[Depressants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressants)** ( *[1,4-Butanediol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/1,4-Butanediol) , [2-methyl-2-butanol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2-methyl-2-butanol) , [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) , [barbiturates](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Barbiturates) , [GHB](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GHB) / [GBL](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GBL) , [methaqualone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methaqualone) , [opioids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioids)* ) - This combination can result in dangerous or even fatal levels of [respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression) . These substances potentiate the [muscle relaxation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_relaxation) , [sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation) and [amnesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amnesia) caused by one another and can lead to unexpected loss of consciousness at high doses. There is also an increased risk of vomiting during unconsciousness and death from the resulting suffocation. If this occurs, users should attempt to fall asleep in the [recovery position](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Recovery_position) or have a friend move them into it.
- **[Dissociatives](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociatives)** - This combination can result in an increased risk of vomiting during unconsciousness and death from the resulting suffocation. If this occurs, users should attempt to fall asleep in the [recovery position](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Recovery_position) or have a friend move them into it.
- **[Stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants)** - It is dangerous to combine thienzodiazepines with [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) due to the risk of excessive intoxication. Stimulants decrease the [sedative](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation) effect of thienzodiazepines, which is the main factor most people consider when determining their level of intoxication. Once the stimulant wears off, the effects of thienzodiazepines will be significantly increased, leading to intensified [disinhibition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Disinhibition) as well as [other effects](/w/index.php?title=Thienzodiazepine&action=edit&redlink=1) . If combined, one should strictly limit themselves to only dosing a certain amount of thienzodiazepines per hour. This combination can also potentially result in severe dehydration if hydration is not monitored.

## Legal status

Deschloroetizolam is a grey area compound within most parts of the world. This means that it is not known to be specifically illegal within any country, but people may still be charged for its possession under certain circumstances such as under analogue laws and with intent to sell or consume.
