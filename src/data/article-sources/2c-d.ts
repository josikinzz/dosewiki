DESCRIPTION #
 
General Effects Notes
 The effects of 2C-D are usually compared to [2C-B](https://erowid.org/chemicals/2cb/) or other psychedelic stimulants and sometimes to MDMA (ecstasy). Its effects are generally considered milder than 2C-B, LSD, or MDMA. 2C-D is not known for strong visuals nor is it generally considered as empathic or euphoric as [MDMA (ecstasy)](https://erowid.org/chemicals/mdma/) . Alexander Shulgin referred to it as "pharmacological tofu", pointing out that it has been used to extend the effects of other compounds and that it is bland by itself. There has been some experimentation with the use of low-dose 2C-D as a "smart drug". 
 
 
Routes of Administration
 2C-D is most often taken orally, though there are reports of it being insufflated. When insufflated, nasal and sinus irritation are common. 
 
 
Addiction and Compulsive Use
 2C-D is not known to be associated with compulsive use and physical dependence is extremely unlikely. Because its use is so uncommon, no definitive statements about its use can be made.
 
EXPERIENCE EXCERPTS #
 
[45-50 mg] "Crazy amphetamine-like shakes and chills. Worse than I was expecting. [...] I cannot get comfortable, no matter what position or how high the heater is turned up. [...] I am in a mildly-happy, mildly-euphoric 'fun' space. I notice details around me that I usually don't. Flowers and colors look exquisite. Unlike my current and past favorites (mescaline and methylone), there is no sexual push at all. In fact, sex seems quite irrelavent and difficult to even think about. The biggest positive going for this material, however, is that it allowed my mind to explore dichotomies in everything I thought about." -- [Exp 32497](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=32497)
 
[15 mg + alcohol] "Very slow ride up... very pleasant all around. A companion and I both likened it to MDMA. It made me very sociable. It also squelched all the drowsiness that came from all the alcohol I drank (which was impressive considering the quantity of alcohol I had). [...] Attention span was fucking shot. [...] No enhancements of bright lights or any visuals at all. I didn't get a chance to check my pupils. My behaviour was very spontaneous and weird. Ideas just came to me, bizarre things I wouldn't normally say." -- [Exp 33231](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=33231)
 
[10 mg + cannabis] "Finished my shower without any strongly noticeable changes from the compound, but I was starting to feel something a 'clear-head' sensation where my thoughts came without effort, but I was still groggy as well, considering the early hour and lack of sleep. [...] So it was then that I sat down to pack some Herb into my pipe and read the first part of Nietsche's 'The Antichrist' for my philosophy class. Usually it is very difficult for me to read anything that early in the morning with any level of appreciable comprehension, but today I was able to clearly focus on the text and make my way through the first 25 paragraphs without much break in concentration or thought." -- [Exp 70588](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=70588)
 
[20 mg] "Butterflies in stomach whole time. OK. This is about the right level. In retrospect, not too interesting. Primarily a stimulant, not entirely physically pleasant. The visual is not too exciting. I am easily distracted. One line of thought to another. I feel that more would be too stimulating." -- [Exp 83181](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=83181)
 
[40 mg] "As I engaged in conversation I noticed the reported 'smart drug' effects. Indeed, my memory, concentration, and thought processes were far from impaired. In fact I felt kind of like I had taken a nootropic like piracetam because I was feeling rather sharp. But, as I looked down at the carpet and saw the first signs of movement, and the body high increased, it did become more difficult to communicate. Yet I remained social, laughing at people's jokes and occasionally chiming in. My sense of humor was most definitely heightened." -- [Exp 46855](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=46855)
 
[15 mg] "Slight visual distortions were apparent. I would frequently notice shimmering disturbances in my peripheral vision, but as soon as I focused on them, they would disappear. It definitely seemed like I was on the verge of breaking into mild hallucinations. At one point I tried watching a television set that was present in the room, and the images on the TV kept alternating between being sped up or slowed down. [...] A moderate degree of pleasurable body sensations was present as well. I found my self often laughing or giggling inappropriately, and just felt all in all stupid. I also seemed to have a high degree of 'mental restlessness'; thoughts in my head were jumping around from topic to topic." -- [Exp 33689](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=33689)
 
[21.5 mg] "Effects are light but persistent and present. I find myself easily enmeshed in aesthetics. I spend the next couple hours playing with photographing items and examining seeds and flowers with a magnifying glass. I chat with my partner and on irc and my mood is light, fun, and friendly. [...] Overall, very pleasant, about 3 hours of mild intoxication, enhanced aesthetic appreciation. Some skin sensual sensations that could be fun to explore sexually, but not a strong erotic push at all. Very little visual disturbance. Distinct mood lift. Definitely something I would repeat." -- [Exp 13361](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=13361)

## SYNTHESIS
A mixture of 34.5 g POCl3 and 31.1 g N-methylformanilide was heated for 10 min on the steam bath, and then there was added 30.4 g of 2,5-dimethoxytoluene. Heating was continued for 2.5 h, and the viscous, black, ugly mess was poured into 600 mL of warm H2O and stirred overnight. The resulting rubbery miniature-rabbit-droppings product was removed by filtration and sucked as free of H2O as possible. The 37.2 g of wet product was extracted on the steam-bath with 4Ã100 mL portions of boiling hexane which, after decantation and cooling, yielded a total of 15.3 g of yellow crystalline product. This, upon recrystallization from 150 mL boiling hexane, gave pale yellow crystals which, when air dried to constant weight, represented 8.7 g of 2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylbenzaldehyde, and had a mp of 83â84 Â°C. Anal. (C8H12O3) C,H,N. The Gattermann aldehyde synthesis gave a better yield (60% of theory) but required the use of hydrogen cyanide gas. The malononitrile derivative, from 5.7 g of the aldehyde and 2.3 g malononitrile in absolute EtOH, treated with a drop of triethylamine, was an orange crystalline product. A sample recrystallized from EtOH gave a mp of 138.5â139 Â°C.

A solution of 8.65 g 2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylbenzaldehyde in 30 g nitromethane was treated with 1.1 g anhydrous ammonium acetate and heated for 50 min on the steam bath. Stripping off the excess nitromethane under vacuum yielded orange crystals which weighed 12.2 g. These were recrystallized from 100 mL IPA providing yellow crystals of 2,5-dimethoxy-4-methyl-Î²-nitrostyrene which weighed, when dry, 7.70 g. The mp was 117â118 Â°C, and this was increased to 118â119 Â°C upon recrystallization from benzene/heptane 1:2.

To a well stirred suspension of 7.0 g LAH in 300 mL of warm THF under an inert atmosphere, there was added 7.7 g 2,5-dimethoxy-4-methyl-Î²-nitrostyrene in 35 mL THF over the course of 0.5 h. This reaction mixture was held at reflux for 24 h, cooled to room temperature, and the excess hydride destroyed with 25 mL IPA. There was then added 7 mL 15% NaOH, followed by 21 mL H2O. The granular gray mass was filtered, and the filter cake washed with 2Ã50 mL THF. The combined filtrate and washes were stripped of their volatiles under vacuum to give a residue weighing 7.7 g which was distilled at 90â115 Â°C at 0.3 mm/Hg to provide 4.90 g of a clear, white oil, which crystallized in the receiver. This was dissolved in 25 mL IPA, and neutralized with concentrated HCl which produced immediate crystals of the salt. These were dispersed with 80 mL anhydrous Et2O, filtered, and washed with Et2O to give, after air drying to constant weight, 4.9 g of fluffy white crystals of 2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylphenethylamine hydrochloride (2C-D). The mp was 213â214 Â°C which was not improved by recrystallization from CH3CN/IPA mixture, or from EtOH. The hydrobromide salt had a mp of 183â184 Â°C. The acetamide, from the free base in pyridine treated with acetic anhydride, was a white crystalline solid which, when recrystallized from aqueous MeOH, had a mp of 116â117 Â°C.


## DOSAGE

## DURATION

## QUALITATIVE COMMENTS
(with 20 mg) âButterflies in stomach whole time. OK. This is about the right level. In retrospect, not too interesting. Primarily a stimulant, not entirely physically pleasant. The visual is not too exciting. I am easily distracted. One line of thought to another. I feel that more would be too stimulating.â

(with 30 mg) âI was into it quite quickly (not much over three-quarters of an hour) and got up to a ++ by the end of an hour. There is something unsatisfactory about trying to classify this level. I had said that I was willing to increase the dose to a higher level, to break out of this not-quite-defined level into something psychedelic. But I may not want to go higher. Under different circumstances I would not mind trying it at a considerably lower dosage, perhaps at the 10 or 15 milligrams. I do not have a comfortable label on this material, yet.â

(with 45 mg) âThere was a rocket from the half-hour to the one and a half hour, from nothing up to a +++. Somehow the intimacy and the erotic never quite knit, and I feel that I am always waiting for the experience to come home. Talking is extremely easy, but something is missing. Appetite is good. I am down by the fifth hour, and sleep is comfortable. This compound will take some learning.â

(with 75 mg) âThis is a +++, but the emphasis is on talking, not on personal interacting. I am putting out, but my boundaries are intact. I was able to sleep at the sixth hour. Communication was excellent. This is fast on, but not too long lived. Maybe a therapy tool?â

(with 150 mg) âA truly remarkable psychedelic, one which could compare favorably with 2C-B. There are intense colors, and I feel that more would be too much.â


## EXTENSIONS AND COMMENTARY
This is probably the most dramatic example of the loss of potency from an amphetamine (DOM, active at maybe 3 milligrams) to a phenethylamine (only one tenth as active). It is so often the case that the first of a series is not the most interesting nor the most potent member. As intriguing and as difficult-to-define as the 2C-D story might be, the next higher homologue of this set, 2C-E, is maximally active at the 15 to 20 milligram level, and is, without any question, a complete psychedelic.

The N-monomethyl and the N,N-dimethyl homologues of 2C-D have been synthesized from 2C-D. The N-monomethyl compound was obtained by the quaternization of the Schiffâs base formed between 2C-D and benzaldehyde with methyl sulfate, followed by hydrolysis; the hydrochloride salt had a melting point of 150â151 Â°C, from EtOH. The N,N-dimethyl compound resulted from the action of formaldehyde-formic acid on 2C-D; the hydrochloride salt had a melting point of 168â169 Â°C from EtOH/ether. These two compounds were some ten times less effective in interfering with conditioned responses in experimental rats. There is no report of their having been explored in man.

I have learned of an extensive study of ethoxy homologues of a number of the phenethylamines in the 2C-X series; they have been collectively called the âTweetios.â This Sylvester and Tweety-bird allusion came directly from the compulsive habit of trying to alleviate the boredom of driving long distances (not under the influence of anything) by the attempt to pronounce the license plates of cars as they passed. The first of this series of compounds had a name that indicated that there was an ethoxy group at the 2-position, or 2-EtO, or Tweetio, and the rest is history. In every compound to be found in the 2C-X family, there are two methoxy groups, one at the 2-position and one at the 5-position. There are thus three possible tweetio compounds, a 2-EtO-, a 5-EtO- and a 2,5-di-EtO-. Those that have been evaluated in man are included after each of the 2C-Xâs that has served as the prototype. In general, the 2-EtO- compounds have a shorter duration and a lower potency, the 5-EtO- compounds have a relatively unchanged potency and a longer time duration; the 2,5-di-EtO- homologues are very weak, if active at all.

The 2-EtO homologue of 2C-D is 2-ethoxy-5-methoxy-4-methylphenethylamine, or 2CD-2ETO. The benzaldehyde (2-ethoxy-5-methoxy-4-tolualdehyde) had a melting point of 60.5â61 Â°C, the nitrostyrene intermediate a melting point of 110.5â111.5 Â°C, and the final hydrochloride a melting point of 207â208 Â°C. The hydrobromide salt had a melting point of 171â173 Â°C. At levels of 60 milligrams, there was the feeling of closeness between couples, without an appreciable state of intoxication. The duration was about 4 hours.

The 5-EtO homologue of 2C-D is 5-ethoxy-2-methoxy-4-methylphenethylamine, or 2CD-5ETO. The benzaldehyde (5-ethoxy-2-ethoxy-4-tolualdehyde 5-ethoxy-2-methoxy-4-tolualdehyde) had a melting point of 81â82 Â°C, and the details of this synthesis are given in the recipe for IRIS. The nitrostyrene intermediate had a melting point of 112.5â113.5 Â°C and the final hydrochloride salt had a melting point of 197â198 Â°C. The hydrobromide salt had a melting point of 158â159 Â°C. At dosage levels of 40 to 50 milligrams, there was a slow, gradual climb to the full effects that were noted in about 2 hours. The experience was largely free from excitement, but with a friendly openness and outgoingness that allowed easy talk, interaction, humor, and a healthy appetite. The duration of effects was 12 hours.

The 2,5-di-EtO homologue of 2C-D is 2,5-diethoxy-4-methylphenethylamine, or 2CD-2,5-DIETO. The benzaldehyde (2,5-diethoxy-4-tolualdehyde) had a melting point of 102â103 Â°C, the nitrostyrene intermediate a melting point of 108â109 Â°C, and the final hydrochloride salt a melting point of 251â252 Â°C. At a level of 55 milligrams, a plus one was reached, and what effects there were, were gone after four hours.

**2,5-Dimethoxy-4-methylphenethylamine** (also known as **2C-M** , **LE-25** and more commonly as **2C-D** ) is a synthetic [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) of the [phenethylamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamine) chemical class that produces short-lived [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) effects when [administered](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Routes_of_administration) . Its sensory and cognitive effects profile has been described as being the most similar to that of [mescaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mescaline) among members of the [2C-x family](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-x_family) , albeit with a significantly shorter duration.

The synthesis of 2C-D was first published in 1970 by a team from the Texas Research Institute of Mental Sciences. Initial trials by [Alexander Shulgin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alexander_Shulgin) at sub-threshold doses in humans were carried out in 1964.

Many anecdotal reports suggest that it is calmer, easier to handle and more comfortable on the body than other closely related [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) [phenethylamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamines) . While not especially visual or physically euphoric at common doses, it is reported to be very lucid, analytical and unimpaired in its headspace - a quality it retains even as the dose is increased.

Lower doses of 2C-D (generally 10 mg or less) have been explored for its use as a potential [nootropic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nootropic) , albeit with mixed results.

Today, 2C-D is used both recreationally and as an [entheogen](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entheogen) . It is rarely sold on the streets and almost exclusively distributed as a gray area [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) by online vendors.

## History and culture

The synthesis of 2C-D was first published in 1970 by a team from the Texas Research Institute of Mental Sciences, , but initial trials by [Alexander Shulgin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alexander_Shulgin) at sub-threshold doses were carried out in 1964. Further investigations at higher doses were carried out by Shulgin and his fellow researchers between 1974 and 1978. The name '2C-D' derives from the chemical's structure - it is the 2-Carbon analogue of [DOM](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DOM) .

Shulgin notably referred to 2C-D as a “pharmacological tofu,” meaning it can extend or potentiate the effect of other substances without overly coloring the experience, in a manner similar to how tofu absorbs the flavors of sauces or spices it is cooked with. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] While some use this as evidence that 2C-D is relatively uninteresting as a psychedelic on its own, others strongly disagree with this assessment and hold that 2C-D is an unusually versatile and fully-fledged [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) in its own right.

Despite showing promise as a very functional psychostimulant with successful studies investigating the use in psychotherapy in Germany, 2C-D has not found widespread use. This has been argued to be due to the previously limited diversity of substances on the market - a consumer dynamic which has changed significantly with the advent of the internet - allowing a broader freedom of choice for explorers of psychedelic phenethylamines. Of these, it tends to be substantially harder to find and notably more expensive by weight. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

## Chemistry

2C-D, or 2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylphenethylamine, is a substituted [phenethylamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamines) featuring a phenyl ring bound to an amino (NH 2 ) group through an ethyl chain. 2C-D contains methoxy functional groups CH 3 O- attached to carbons R 2 and R 5 as well as a methyl group attached to carbon R 4 of the phenyl ring.

2C-D belongs to the 2C family of phenethylamines which contain methoxy groups on the 2 and 5 positions of the benzene ring.

## Pharmacology

2C-D's [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) effects are believed to come from its efficacy at the [5-HT2A receptor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin#The_5-HT_system) as a [partial agonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist#Agonists) . However, the role of these interactions and how they result in the [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) experience continues to remain elusive.

## Subjective effects

The head space of 2C-D is described by many as being lucid, insightful and relatively normal in its thought processes even at moderate to high doses. The feeling of unaltered consciousness may be unsatisfying to users who want an intense experience because the head space is fairly normal, stable and therefore sometimes uninteresting to those who are new to hallucinogenic experiences.

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)** - In terms of its effects on the physical energy levels of the user, the 2C-D experience begins with mild sedation that gives way to moderate stimulation as the experience progresses. It lacks the forceful energetic push associated with most psychedelic [phenethylamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamines) .
- **[Spontaneous physical sensations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_physical_sensations)** - The "body high" of 2C-D can be described as a pleasurable, all-encompassing comfort sensation. This maintains a consistent presence that steadily rises with the onset and hits its limit once the peak has been reached.
- **[Bodily control enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bodily_control_enhancement)** - Whilst at lower doses one may find that their bodily control is enhanced, at higher dosages it seems to become suppressed.
- **[Tactile enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_enhancement)**
- **[Temperature regulation suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Temperature_regulation_suppression)**
- **[Increased heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate)**
- **[Dehydration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dehydration)**
- **[Nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea)** - In comparison to other [phenethylamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamines) such as [2C-E](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-E) , [2C-I](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-I) or [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) , any nausea produced by this substance tends to be very mild and dissipates quickly even with higher dosages.
- **[Pupil dilation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pupil_dilation)** ### Visual effects
 
- Compared to other members of the 2C-x family like [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) , the visual effects of 2C-D have been noted for being understated until heavier doses are reached. After this point, a full spectrum of hallucinatory visual phenomena begin to appear. 
#### Enhancements
 
- **[Colour enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_enhancement)**
- **[Pattern recognition enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition_enhancement)**
- **[Visual acuity enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_acuity_enhancement)**
 
#### Distortions
 
- **[Drifting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting)** *( [melting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Melting) , [flowing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Flowing) , [breathing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Breathing) and [morphing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#morphing) )* - In comparison to other psychedelics, this effect can be described as low in detail, slow and smooth in motion, static in appearance and realistic in style.
- **[Tracers](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tracers)**
- **[After images](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/After_images)**
- **[Colour shifting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_shifting)**
- **[Colour tinting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_tinting)**
- **[Symmetrical texture repetition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Symmetrical_texture_repetition)**
- **[Recursion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Recursion)**
- **[Diffraction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Diffraction)**
 
#### Geometry
 
The visual geometry of 2C-D be described as more similar in appearance to that of [DOM](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DOM) or [25D-NBOMe](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25D-NBOMe) than that of [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) , [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) or [2C-I](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-I) . It can be comprehensively described as structured in its organization, organic in style, intricate in complexity, large in style, slow and smooth in motion, colorful in scheme, bright in color, blurred in its edges and equally rounded and angular in its corners. It gives off a natural feel at higher dosages. While the final level of 2C-D geometry has yet to be formally confirmed, it seems more likely that it would result in states of [level 8B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/8B_Geometry) visual geometry over [level 8A](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/8A_Geometry) .
 
#### Hallucinatory states
 
- **[Transformations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Transformations)**
- **[Internal hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucination)** ( *[autonomous entities](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Autonomous_entities)* ; *[settings, sceneries, and landscapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Settings,_sceneries,_and_landscapes)* ; *[perspective hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perspective_hallucinations)* and *[scenarios and plots](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenarios_and_plots)* ) - In comparison to other psychedelics such as [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) , 2C-D is low in hallucinations embedded within visual geometry. However, when it does occur this particular effect commonly contains hallucinations with scenarios, settings, concepts and autonomous entity contact. They are more common within dark environments and can be described as internal in their manifestation, lucid in believability, and interactive in style.
- **[External hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/External_hallucination)** ( *[settings, sceneries, and landscapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Settings,_sceneries,_and_landscapes)* ; *[perspective hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perspective_hallucinations)* and *[scenarios and plots](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenarios_and_plots)* ) - 2C-D is capable of external hallucinations embedded within visual geometry. This particular effect commonly contains hallucinations with scenarios, settings, concepts and autonomous entity contact. They can be described as external in their manifestation, lucid in believability, and fixed in style. ### Cognitive effects
 
- - **[Analysis enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Analysis_enhancement)**
- **[Conceptual thinking](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Conceptual_thinking)**
- **[Emotion enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Emotion_enhancement)**
- **[Introspection](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Introspection)**

- **[Memory suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Memory_suppression)** 
- **[Ego death](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ego_death)**
- **[Novelty enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Novelty_enhancement)**
- **[Personal bias suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Personal_bias_suppression)**
- **[Thought acceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_acceleration)**
- **[Thought connectivity](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_connectivity)**
- **[Time distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Time_distortion)** ### Auditory effects
 
- - **[Enhancements](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_enhancement)**
- **[Distortions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_distortion)**
- **[Hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_hallucinations)** ### Multi-sensory effects
 
- - **[Synaesthesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Synaesthesia)** - In its fullest manifestation, this is a very rare and non-reproducible effect. Increasing the dosage can increase the likelihood of this occurring, but seems to only be a prominent part of the experience among those who are already predisposed to synaesthetic states. ### Transpersonal effects
 
- - **[Existential self-realization](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Existential_self-realization)**
- **[Unity and interconnectedness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Unity_and_interconnectedness)**
### Experience reports

There are currently no anecdotal reports which describe the effects of this compound within our [experience index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Experience_index) . Additional experience reports can be found here:

- [Erowid Experience Vaults: 2C-D](https://erowid.org/experiences/subs/exp_2CD.shtml)

## Toxicity and harm potential

The toxicity and long-term health effects of recreational 2C-D use do not seem to have been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dose is unknown. This is because 2C-D is a [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) with very little history of human usage.

Anecdotal evidence from those within the community who have tried 2C-D suggests that there are no negative health effects attributed to simply trying the substance by itself at low to moderate doses and using it very sparingly (but nothing can be completely guaranteed). [Independent research](https://www.google.com) should always be done to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe before consumption.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this substance.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

2C-D is not habit-forming and the desire to use it can actually decrease with use. It is most often self-regulating.

Tolerance to the effects of 2C-D is built almost immediately after ingestion. After that, it takes about 3 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 7 days to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). 2C-D presents cross-tolerance with all [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) , meaning that after the consumption of 2C-D all psychedelics will have a reduced effect.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **[Lithium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_(medication))** - Lithium is commonly prescribed for the treatment of [bipolar disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder) . There is a large body of anecdotal evidence that suggests taking it with [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) significantly increases the risk of [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) and [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) . As a result, this combination is strictly discouraged.
- **[Cannabis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cannabis)** - Cannabis may have an unexpectedly strong and unpredictable synergy with the effects of 2C-D. Caution is advised with this combination as it can significantly increase the risk of adverse psychological reactions like [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) , and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) . Users are advised to start off with only a fraction of their normal cannabis dose and take long breaks between hits to avoid unintentional overdose.
- **[Stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants)** - Stimulants like [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) , [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) or [methylphenidate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylphenidate) affect many parts of the brain and alter [dopaminergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) function. This combination can increase the risk of [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) , and [thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops) . This interaction may also result in an elevated risk of [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) . [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol)** - Tramadol is well-documented to lower the seizure threshold and [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) may act to trigger seizures in susceptible individuals. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

  "tripsit-wiki": `# 2C-D

*Source: https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/2C-D*

**2C-D** is a short acting psychedelic drug of the [2C-X family](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/2C-X).
The effects of 2C-D are usually compared to 2C-B (although not as visual as 2C-B) or other psychedelic stimulants and sometimes to MDMA (ecstasy). Its effects are generally considered milder than 2C-B, LSD, or MDMA. 2C-D is also known for the strong body component of its effects which are alternately described as pleasurable energy or a 'sense of being in the body', and by others as an unpleasant 'buzzing' or body-load, which is mostly occurring during onset. 
Shulgin himself referred to this substance as a “pharmacological tofu,” meaning that when mixed with other substances, it can extend or potentiate their effects without coloring the experience too much, in a manner similar to how tofu absorbs the flavors of sauces or spices it is cooked with. Some people have claimed 2C-D is relatively uninteresting on its own, but many other users have strongly disagreed with this assessment and believe instead 2C-D to be a true psychedelic in its own right. 

## History

It was first synthesized in 1970 by a team from the Texas Research Institute of Mental Sciences, and its activity was subsequently investigated in humans by Alexander Shulgin.

### Pharmacology

Like most psychedelic drugs, 2C-D is a 5-HT2a Agonist; from that, we can presume the concurrent or pre-administration of SSRIs may reduce the effects of 2C-D. The 2C-X family, specifically, 2C-E, 2C-I, and 2C-C all stimulated G protein binding, suggesting more of an activity similar to tryptamines such as 5-MeO-DMT and, interestingly, DPT. G Proteins are membrane proteins that effectively mediate interaction between hormone receptors and enzymes responsible for changes of metabolism as a result of hormonal changes.

In rats, Stage I metabolism involved deamination and O-Demthylation, which are related to the Monoamine oxidase (MAO) and cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes. For virtually all the 2C’s, (B,I,D,E,T-2, and T-7), MAO-A and MAO-B were reacted upon; interestingly, ½ of the molecules in Shulgin’s Magical Half Dozen (2C-E, 2C-T-2, 2C-T-7, with the addition of 2C-D) also act to a small extent on the CYP2D6 enzyme. Because of the commonality of these receptors, the 2C-X family is likely to be more reactive with other concurrently administered chemicals.

## Harm Reduction

2C-D is one of the safer psychedelics, with several reported cases of users far exceeding commonly used dosing limits without lasting adverse physical effects. It is also observed to have a low addiction potential. It is a stimulating psychedelic, and therefore it's important to remain hydrated. Refer to [Psychedelic Harm Reduction](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/Psychedelics#Harm_Reduction) for more information.

## Legal Status

- Denmark: 2C-D is added to the list of Schedule B controlled substances.

- Sweden: Sveriges riksdags health ministry Statens folkhälsoinstitut classified 2C-D as "health hazard" under the act Lagen om förbud mot vissa hälsofarliga varor (translated Act on the Prohibition of Certain Goods Dangerous to Health) as of March 1, 2005, in their regulation SFS 2005:26 listed as 2,5-dimetoxi-4-metylfenetylamin (2C-D), making it illegal to sell or possess.

- United States: [Schedule I](https://www.justice.gov/dea/druginfo/ds.shtml) (Illegal to produce, supply, or possess)

*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2C-D*

2C-D, also known as 4-methyl-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine, is a psychedelic drug of the phenethylamine and 2C families. It has an unusually wide and gradual dose range and at low doses produces claimed cognitive enhancer-like effects, mild stimulant effects, and mild perceptual effects, whereas at high doses, it produces robust psychedelic effects. The drug is taken orally.
It acts as an agonist of the serotonin 5-HT2 receptors, including of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor. The drug is structurally related to other psychedelic and related phenethylamines such as its higher homologues DOM and Ariadne (4C-D) and other 2C psychedelics like 2C-B and 2C-E.
2C-D was first described in the literature by Beng T. Ho and colleagues in 1970. Its properties and effects in humans were described by Alexander Shulgin and colleagues in 1975. The drug was extensively studied by Hanscarl Leuner under the names DMM-PEA and LE-25 in psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy in Germany in the 1970s and 1980s. It was also informally studied by Darrell Lemaire as a potential "smart drug" in the 1970s and 1980s. 2C-D was first encountered as a novel designer drug by 2005. It became a controlled substance in the United States in 2012.

## Use and effects

In his book PiHKAL (Phenethylamines I Have Known and Loved) and other publications, Alexander Shulgin lists 2C-D's dose range as 20 to 60 mg orally and its duration as 4 to 6 hours. He describes threshold effects as occurring at a dose of 6 mg orally and full intoxication occurring at doses of 10 to 15 mg orally. Higher doses of 75 to 200 mg orally have also been described and were well-tolerated. In addition, a wider recreational dose range of 3 to 100 mg or more has been described. The onset is said to be 20 to 30 minutes and peak effects occur after 1.5 to 2 hours. Casey Hardison has described 2C-D as having a very gentle dose–response curve with an unusually wide dose range.
The effects of 2C-D have been described. At low doses, it produces perceived cognitive enhancement, mild stimulant-like effects, emotional integration, euphoria, and mild psychedelic effects such as perceptual enhancement that are much lighter than those of conventional psychedelics. At high doses, it produces robust psychedelic effects. Shulgin referred to 2C-D as a "pharmacological tofu" because it didn't have especially pronounced effects on its own until very high doses were reached but could be combined with and extend or potentiate the effects of other psychedelics without coloring their experiences.
Hanscarl Leuner, working in Germany, explored the use of 2C-D under the code name LE-25 in psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy at doses of up to 150 to 200 mg orally. Low doses of 2C-D in the range of 5 to 10 mg orally have been explored as a "smart drug" by Darrell Lemaire.

## Interactions

2C-D is metabolized by the monoamine oxidase (MAO) enzymes MAO-A and MAO-B. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) such as phenelzine, tranylcypromine, moclobemide, and selegiline may potentiate the effects of 2C-D. This may result in overdose and serious toxicity.

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

2C-D acts as a partial agonist of the serotonin 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, and 5-HT2C receptors.

## Chemistry

### Synthesis

The chemical synthesis of 2C-D has been described.

### Analogues

Analogues of 2C-D include 2C-B, 2C-E, 2C-P, other 2Cs, DOM (α-methyl-2C-D), Ariadne (4C-D; α-ethyl-2C-D), 5C-D (α-propyl-2C-D), and TWEETIOs like 2CD-5-ETO, among others. Other notable derivatives of 2C-D include 2C-G (3-methyl-2C-D) and other compounds of the 2C-G series like 2C-G-3 and 2C-G-5.

## History

2C-D was first described in the scientific literature by Beng T. Ho and colleagues at the Texas Research Institute of Mental Sciences in 1970. They described its synthesis and pharmacological effects in animals. The properties and effects of 2C-D in humans, along with those of 2C-B, were described by Alexander Shulgin and Michael Carter in 1975. Shulgin had first tested 2C-D at sub-threshold doses in 1964 and 1965. Subsequently, he tested it at higher doses in 1974 and 1975 and discovered its psychoactive effects.
Hanscarl Leuner and his student Michael Schlichting extensively studied 2C-D at high doses in psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy in Germany in the 1970s and 1980s. Darrell Lemaire, under the pseudonyms Hosteen Nez and/or Lazar, studied 2C-D at low doses as a potential "smart drug" in the 1970s and 1980s.
2C-D was encountered as a novel recreational designer drug in the United States by 2005. It was not a controlled substance in the United States or most other countries at this time, in contrast to more popular 2Cs like 2C-B and 2C-T-7. The drug became a Schedule I controlled substance in the United States in 2012.
