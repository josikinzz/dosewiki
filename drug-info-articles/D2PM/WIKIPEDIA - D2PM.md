Diphenylprolinol (D2PM), or (R/S)-(±)-diphenyl-2-pyrrolidinyl-methanol, is a norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor which is used as a designer drug.

## Pharmacology

The dextrorotary (R)-(+)-enantiomer is the more pharmacologically active, although a variety of related derivatives have been studied.
Side effects including chest pain (suggestive of possible cardiovascular toxicity) have been seen following recreational use of diphenylprolinol, although it was combined with glaucine in a party pill product, thus making it impossible to say for certain which drug was responsible.

## Other uses

Diphenylprolinol can be used to prepare the chiral CBS catalyst, which is used for enantioselective organic synthesis.
