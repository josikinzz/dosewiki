## Subjective Experience

I sampled this in March 2015, shortly before it was banned in the UK via a
Temporary Class Drug Order (TCDO). Compared to other stims in its class it was
potent, at least mg for mg, but I did not find it to be particularly recreational.

It was certainly functional, in that I was lively and awake under its influence. In line
with the durations cited by reference sites, I also recall that I was stimulated for
almost the entire day.

Due to the legislation, lack of significant uplift in mood, and occasional warnings of
vasoconstriction and associated risks, I only tested it on the one occasion. Despite
this, and again demonstrating that experience is subjective, 3,4-CTMP was a winner
('fastest riser') in the VICE Netherlands Designer Drug Awards in 2014. It was also
the most searched for drug on one of the main Internet forums in 2012, and was
sometimes suggested as an alternative to methylphenidate.

By and large, it now appears to have faded into the annals of history.

**3,4-Dichloromethylphenidate** (also known by the incorrectly abbreviated name **3,4-CTMP** ) is a [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) substance of the [phenidate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenidate) class. It is a structural analog of [methylphenidate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylphenidate) ( *Ritalin* ). The two substances have similar pharmacological profiles but different subjective effects.

It is approximately seven times more potent than methylphenidate in animal studies [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] , but likely has weaker reinforcing effects due to its slower onset of action. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] According to anecdotal reports, the active dose of 3,4-CTMP is approximately 10 times lower than the dose of [methylphenidate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylphenidate) to achieve a similar effect. 3,4-CTMP has a duration of 6 to 18 hours rather than the 4 to 6 hour duration found with [methylphenidate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylphenidate) .

3,4-CTMP has an extremely short history of human [recreational use](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Recreational_drug_use) and has yet to be documented being sold on the streets. It is available for sale as grey market [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) by online vendors. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

Due to its potent stimulant effects, habit-forming properties as well as an unknown toxicity profile, it is strongly recommended that one use proper [harm reduction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Harm_reduction) practices if using with this substance.

## Chemistry

3,4-CTMP, or 3,4-dichloromethylphenidate, is a synthetic molecule of the [substituted phenethylamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Substituted_phenethylamine) and [substituted phenidate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Substituted_phenidate) classes. It contains a phenethylamine core featuring a phenyl ring bound to an amino -NH2 group through an ethyl chain. It is structurally similar to [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) , featuring a substitution at R α which is incorporated into a [piperidine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Piperidine) ring ending at the terminal amine of the phenethylamine chain. Additionally, it contains a methyl acetate bound to R β of its structure and is chlorinated at R 3 and R 4 of its phenyl ring.

3,4-CTMP is nearly identical in structure to [methylphenidate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylphenidate) ; the difference is that it contains two chlorine atoms bonded to the phenyl group at the 3 and 4 positions.

## Pharmacology

3,4-CTMP acts as a [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) and [norepinephrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Norepinephrine) [reuptake inhibitor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Reuptake_inhibitor) , meaning it effectively boosts the levels of dopamine and norepinephrine [neurotransmitters](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurotransmitters) in the brain by binding to and partially blocking the transporter proteins that normally remove those monoamines from the synaptic cleft. This allows dopamine and norepinephrine to accumulate within the brain, resulting in stimulating and euphoric effects. 3,4-CTMP has also been identified as a relatively potent agonist of 5-HT2B serotonin receptors. This is concerning, as agonism of the 5-HT2B receptors results in a potentially serious effect called pulmonary hypertension, where the pulmonary artery that pumps blood from the heart to the lungs constricts. Additionally, chronic stimulation of 5-HT2B receptors has been implicated in serious heart valve disease via fibrosis. Other drugs with this effect, such as [aminorex](/w/index.php?title=Aminorex&action=edit&redlink=1) (a pharmaceutical weight loss drug that was pulled from the market), have resulted in a large number of long term heart injuries and fatalities across the world.

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)** 3,4-CTMP is moderately to highly stimulating. The stimulation present is weaker than [methamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) , [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) , and [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) . It is stronger than [caffeine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Caffeine) and similar in strength to [methylphenidate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylphenidate) . The style of stimulation can be described as forced, but less so than cocaine and amphetamine. At lower doses it encourages productivity, while at higher doses it encourages physical activity such as running and dancing.
- **[Dehydration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dehydration)**
- **[Appetite suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Appetite_suppression)**
- **[Increased heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate)**
- **[Increased blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure)**
- **[Decreased blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Decreased_blood_pressure)** - Rapid drops in blood pressure may occur spontaneously at points in the experience and result in dizziness, tinnitus, and/or fainting, particularly at high doses. It is usually accompanied by an increased and sometimes erratic heart rate and usually resolves within a few minutes. However, this could possibly be serious and medical attention should be sought if one passes out and has erratic heart beats.
- **[Teeth grinding](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Teeth_grinding)** - This component can be considered to be less intense when compared with that of [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) .
- **Pulmonary hypertension** - 3,4-CTMP is likely a potent 5-HT2B receptor agonist, which has the effect of increasing blood pressure in the pulmonary artery (the artery that supplies blood to the lungs). This may lead to shortness of breath, dizziness, and other cardiac symptoms. Other substances that have this effect, such as aminorex, are proven to be extremely harmful to short and long-term heart health. This effect has the potential to be serious and life-threatening, particularly with high doses and/or chronic use.
- **[Abnormal heartbeat](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Abnormal_heartbeat)** - This component is increasingly likely at high doses and can be potentially serious.
- **[Optical sliding](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Optical_sliding)** - This component involves slow, involuntary eye movement that result in an inability to focus the eyes on one point, as well as uncontrolled independent movement of the individual eyes that causes them to lose synchronization and results in double vision. It is inconsistently present at very high doses.
- **[Pupil dilation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pupil_dilation)** - The pupil dilation experienced is relatively minimal compared to other dopaminergic stimulants.
- **[Dizziness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dizziness)**
- **[Headaches](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Headaches)** - Headaches can be severe and usually occur at high doses or at the offset of the experience. While the headaches from 3,4-CTMP are usually not serious, extreme, "worst pain of your life" headaches are a medical emergency.
- **[Brain zaps](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Brain_zaps)** - This effect is increasingly common at high doses and can be highly uncomfortable.
- **[Temporary erectile dysfunction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Temporary_erectile_dysfunction)** - This is common at all doses.
- **[Vasoconstriction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction)** - The vasoconstriction effects are strong and on par with that of [methamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) . It may be potentially dangerous at high doses or in cold environments.
- **[Mouth numbing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mouth_numbing)**
- **[Stamina enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stamina_enhancement)** - This component is present at low to moderate doses, while high doses tend to decrease stamina.
- **[Tactile enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_enhancement)** - At moderate doses this effect is subtle and not very noticeable. At high and excessive doses, tactile sensitivity can become overwhelming and uncomfortable. It includes increased sensitivity to pain, uncomfortable textures, and temperature. This effect is strongest on the offset of the experience.
- **[Spontaneous physical sensations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_physical_sensations)** - This effect is usually present only on high and excessive doses and can be described at its mildest point as a neutral or slightly uncomfortable tingling that appears at random points on the body and moves a short distance in a random direction. It tends to be particularly present on the scalp. This effect can intensify to become electric shock sensations that are unpleasant or even painful. It is different than the tingling or pins-and-needles induced by vasoconstriction and is likely linked to excessive stimulation of 5-HT2B receptors. ### Visual effects
 
- The visual effects of 3,4-CTMP usually only occur when a user is sleep deprived and has taken very high doses. They are most prominent when peaking and dissipate when coming down. The effects are primarily suppressions. The mechanism responsible for the visual effects is unknown. 
#### Enhancements
 
- **[Visual acuity enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_acuity_enhancement)** - This effect is mild and may occur at the onset and the some of the peak of a high dose when the user is not sleep deprived.
 
#### Distortions
 
- **[Color tinting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Color_tinting)** - This effect only appears when very high doses are consumed and involves slight tinting of the entire field of vision with basic colors. It is most prevalent at the peak of the experience and is usually subtle.
- **[Drifting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting)** - This effect is mild and only usually appears on high doses and when sleep deprived. This effect involves objects such as text moving back and forth horizontally or, more rarely, vertically at a fixed rate slowly and without blurring. It may be related to involuntary eye movements.
 
#### Suppressions
 
- **[Double vision](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Double_vision)** - 3,4-CTMP can induce two different types of double vision. This occurs at high or excessive doses and when sleep deprived. One type of double vision is caused by a lack of synchronization between the eyes, where they do not move in the same direction at the same rate. Either or both eyes may be affected. This requires one to close the bad eye in order to read. If both eyes are affected, it can be severely impairing. The second kind is monocular double vision, where one or both eyes see the real image, with a coloured version of the image positioned directly vertical above. This primarily affects bright or high-contrast objects such as text on a computer screen and does not affect more bland objects such as furniture. Tilting the surface of what is being viewed so it is seen at an angle removes the effect.
- **[Visual acuity suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_acuity_suppression)** - This commonly occurs at the offset of a high dose and involves blurring of vision due to difficulty focusing the eyes from lack of accommodation. Squinting generally helps this effect. ### Cognitive effects
 
- - **[Thought acceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_acceleration)** - This effect is usually mild.
- **[Analysis enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Analysis_enhancement)** - Analysis enhancement is most prevalent at low-moderate doses.
- **[Wakefulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness)** - 3,4-CTMP often results in extended periods of wakefulness, especially when redosed.
- **[Increased music appreciation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_music_appreciation)** - This effect is common, but relatively mild.
- **[Focus enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Focus_enhancement)** - This component is most effective at low to moderate dosages as anything higher will usually impair concentration. 3,4-CTMP typically induces extremely strong focus. This often results in states of hyper-focus in which one becomes fixated on a task for extended periods of time regardless of the purpose of it.
- **[Motivation enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motivation_enhancement)** - 3,4-CTMP is typically moderately motivating; productivity is strongest at low-moderate doses due to the excessive and uncontrollable focus that occurs at higher doses.
- **[Euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_euphoria)** - 3,4-CTMP is reported to be inconsistent in euphoria, regardless of dose. In general, lower doses are often mildly euphoric while the physical discomfort and anxiety of higher doses results in dysphoria.
- **[Cognitive dysphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_dysphoria)** - Dysphoria often occurs when an excessive dose is taken, as well as during the offset of moderate-heavy doses.
- **[Anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety)** - This effect is rare on low to moderate doses, but becomes increasingly common at higher doses or extended binges.
- **[Thought organization](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_organization)** - This is common during the peak, but typically subsides during the offset. The opposite effect, thought disorganisation, may occur at high doses.
- **[Irritability](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Irritability)** - This tends to occur at high doses.
- **[Ego inflation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ego_inflation)** - Ego inflation is very mild compared to [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) and [methamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) and tends to present only at high doses.
- **[Disinhibition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Disinhibition)** - This effect is mild and usually occurs at moderate to high doses. Excessive doses may instead result in inhibition due to anxiety.
- **[Emotion suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Emotion_suppression)** - 3,4-CTMP may inconsistently reduce emotionality in a similar manner to [methylphenidate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylphenidate) .
- **[Time distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Time_distortion)** - This is the experience of time speeding up and passing more quickly than normal. It is common at moderate-high doses. ### After effects
 
- The effects which occur during the [offset](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Offset) of a [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) experience generally feel negative and uncomfortable in comparison to the effects which occurred during its [peak](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Peak) . This is often referred to as a "comedown" and occurs because of [neurotransmitter](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurotransmitter) depletion. Its effects commonly include: 
- **[Anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety)** - Mild at low-moderate doses, but can be extreme and debilitating at higher doses. It typically coincides with a highly elevated and possibly abnormal heart rate.
- **[Cognitive fatigue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_fatigue)**
- **[Cognitive dysphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_dysphoria)** - This is usually much less intense than that induced during the comedown of [methamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) and other serotonergic stimulants.
- **[Depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depression)** - This is usually much less intense than that induced during the comedown of [methamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) and other serotonergic stimulants.
- **[Irritability](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Irritability)**
- **[Motivation suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motivation_suppression)**
- **[Thought deceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_deceleration)** - This is usually mild, even with high doses.
- **[Wakefulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness)** - Extreme prolonged wakefulness often occurs, even after all other core effects have subsided, especially after using a high dose or after redosing.
- **[Paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia)** - Relatively rare at common doses and not as common as with other stimulants, but may occur at high doses or when sleep deprived.
- **[Stimulant psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant_psychosis)** - Possible when abused for prolonged periods of time, but typically a result of excessive use of the substance in combination with being sleep deprivation; however, this situation can often occur during regular use as the substance's extremely long duration and strong [eugeroic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness) effects can both cause loss of sleep, and suppress feelings of fatigue and other potential indicators that one is sleep deprived, which may cause loss of sleep to accumulate over time resulting in severe sleep deprivation that one may attempt to compensate for by increasing usage of the substance, both increasing the likelihood of [stimulant psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant_psychosis) occurring. Stimulant psychosis occurring in the absence of sleep deprivation is unlikely as the strong physical side effects and anxiety induced by high doses usually prevent binges that are extreme enough to induce psychosis. Additionally, the prolonged onset and slow come-up prevent the classic 'rush' associated with other dopaminergic stimulants, reducing the desire for compulsive redosing, but also increases the likelihood of an 'accidental overdose' occurring from a user redosing during the onset or before the peak effects occur from an initial dose.
### Experience reports

There are currently no anecdotal reports which describe the effects of this compound within our [experience index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Experience_index) . Additional experience reports can be found here:

- [Erowid Experience Vaults: 3,4-Dichloromethylphenidate](https://www.erowid.org/experiences/subs/exp_34Dichloromethylphenidate.shtml)

## Toxicity and harm potential

The toxicity and long-term health effects of recreational 3,4-CTMP use do not seem to have been studied in any scientific context, and the exact toxic dosage is unknown. This is because 3,4-CTMP is a [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) with very little history of human usage.

Although anecdotal evidence from people who have tried 3,4-CTMP suggests that there are unlikely to be negative health effects attributed to simply trying the substance by itself at low to moderate doses, the agonist activity it displays for the 5-HT 2B receptor is a cause for concern, as acute 5-HT 2B agonism has been shown to result in a potentially dangerous and largely asymptomatic effect called pulmonary hypertension. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] Moreover, the long-term stimulation of 5-HT 2B receptors has been shown to lead to fibrosis of the heart valves, which may result in stroke and/or severe, permanent heart disease.

Other substances that display this activity, such as the recalled weight-loss drug aminorex, have caused serious and often fatal heart disease when used for even relatively short periods of time. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] It is highly recommended that, should one choose to use this substance despite these concerns, it only be taken very sparingly and in low doses. Those with cardiovascular diseases of any kind should not consume this substance. [Independent research](https://www.google.com/) should always be done to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe before consumption.

Extreme caution must be taken when managing one's 3,4-CTMP usage as the duration of its stimulating effects can be very long, which can cause unwanted sleep inhibition. This should be considered when redosing as the physically stimulating effects of a dose may persist after the psychological effects have worn off. A user attempting to maintain a state of euphoria may run the risk of accumulating medically dangerous quantities of the substance in their bloodstream.

It is strongly recommended that one not [insufflate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Insufflated) 3,4-CTMP as it has a low solubility in water so is not readily absorbed through the nasal mucus membrane and anecdotal reports suggest that insufflation of the substance is painful and potentially extremely caustic. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] Additionally, the poor adsorption by the nasal mucus membrane often results in the majority of the substance slowly entering the stomach through a post-nasal drip, making the onset duration even longer, which may increase the chance of an 'accidental overdose' if one redoses more due to a lack of effect.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when choosing to use this substance.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

In terms of its tolerance, many users have reported that 3,4-CTMP can be used for multiple days in a row for extended periods of time without any noticeable acute tolerance build up, instead increasing gradually over regular and extended use. Unusually, there are some reports indicating a sudden rise in tolerance after an extended period of relatively little increase. This results in the user requiring an increase in dosage to achieve the same effects or to remain functional. Increasing dose to match tolerance places one at high risk of addiction.

It has been reported that 3,4-CTMP has potential for abuse on par with that of [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) or [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) due to its lack of significant tolerance, euphoric effects and action upon [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) transporters. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **[25x-NBOMe](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25x-NBOMe) & [25x-NBOH](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25x-NBOH)** - 25x compounds are highly stimulating and physically straining. Combinations with 3,4-CTMP should be strictly avoided due to the risk of excessive [stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation) and heart strain. This can result in [increased blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure) , [vasoconstriction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction) , panic attacks, [thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops) , [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) , and heart failure in extreme cases.
- **[Alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol)** - Combining alcohol with [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) can be dangerous due to the risk of accidental over-intoxication. Stimulants mask alcohol's [depressant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressant) effects, which is what most people use to assess their degree of intoxication. Once the stimulant wears off, the [depressant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressant) effects will be left unopposed, which can result in blackouts and severe [respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression) . If mixing, the user should strictly limit themselves to only drinking a certain amount of alcohol per hour.
- **[DXM](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DXM)** - Combinations with DXM should be avoided due to its inhibiting effects on [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) and [norepinephrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Norepinephrine) reuptake. There is an increased risk of [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) and hypertensive crisis, or [serotonin syndrome](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome) with serotonin releasers ( [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) , [methylone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylone) , [mephedrone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mephedrone) , etc.). Monitor blood pressure carefully and avoid strenuous physical activity.
- **[MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA)** - Any neurotoxic effects of MDMA are likely to be increased when other [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) are present. There is also a risk of excessive blood pressure and heart strain (cardiotoxicity).
- **[MXE](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MXE)** - Some reports suggest combinations with MXE may dangerously increase blood pressure and increase the risk of [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) .
- **[Dissociatives](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociatives)** - Both classes carry a risk of [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) , [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) , and these risk may be multiplied when combined.
- **[Stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants)** - 3,4-CTMP may be dangerous to combine with other [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) like [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) as they can [increase one's heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate) and [blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure) to dangerous levels.
- **[Tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol)** - Tramadol is known to lower the seizure threshold and combinations with stimulants may further increase this risk.

- **[MAOIs](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MAOIs)** - This combination may increase the amount of neurotransmitters such as dopamine to dangerous or even fatal levels. Examples include [syrian rue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Syrian_rue) , [banisteriopsis caapi](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Banisteriopsis_caapi) , and some [antidepressants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antidepressants) .

*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3,4-Dichloromethylphenidate*

3,4-dichloromethylphenidate (abbreviated as 3,4-DCMP, and incorrectly as 3,4-CTMP for the d,l-threo diastereomer) is a potent stimulant drug from the phenidate class closely related to methylphenidate. It acts as a potent serotonin-norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor with a long duration of action. It has been sold online as a designer drug.

## Chemistry

3,4-DCMP is the 3,4-dichlorinated analogue of methylphenidate. The 3,4-dichlorination is a common modification done to most monoamine reuptake inhibitors.

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

The result of the 3,4-dichlorination on 3,4-DCMP is a higher selectivity for the serotonin transporter and serotonin uptake inhibition. Serotonergic activity among phenidates is very rare, and 3,4-DCMP is one of only three compounds from this class with appreciable serotonergic activity, the other two being HDMP-28 & HDEP-28. The reason for the serotonergic activity of all three compounds is a bulky aryl ring system (in the case of the aforementioned compounds, a 2-naphthalene ring), which mimics the bicyclic indole ring system of serotonin. Examples of compounds with the same SAR modifications done to increase serotonergic activity include naphthylaminopropane and 3,4-dichloroamphetamine.
The 3,4-dichloro group also increases resistance to metabolism, which can be seen on the compound's greatly increased duration of action and biological half-life. Furthermore, it also results in a greatly increased affinity for both the dopamine and noradrenaline transporters, because the 3,4-dichloro group more closely mimics the 3,4-dihydroxy group found on dopamine and adrenaline. Examples of compounds with the same SAR modification done to increase affinity to DAT & NET include dichloropane and O-2390.
3,4-CTMP, the d,l-threo diastereomer of 3,4-DCMP, is approximately seven times more potent than methylphenidate in animal studies, but has weaker reinforcing effects due to its slower onset of action. However, H. M. Deutsch's discrimination ratio implies it to be more reinforcing than cocaine.

1 This is an abbreviation of the d,l-erythro diastereomer of 3,4-DCMP.
2 This is an abbreviation of d,l-threomethylphenidate, more widely known by its brand name Ritalin.

## Legality

As of November 2016 3,4-DCMP (aka 3,4-CTMP) is now included in Canada's CDSA as a schedule III substance.
As of October 2015 3,4-CTMP is a controlled substance in China.
3,4-CTMP was banned in the UK as a Temporary Class Drug from April 2015 following its unapproved sale as a designer drug.
Sweden's public health agency suggested to classify 3,4-CTMP as hazardous substance on 10 November 2014.
