5-MeO-MIPT, or 5-methoxy-N-methyl-N-isopropyltryptamine also known as “Moxy” is a psychedelic and entactogenic drug in a class of compounds commonly known as tryptamines. It is the N-methyl-N-isopropyl homologue of the well know psychedelic 5-MeO-DMT. It has structural and pharmacodynamic properties similar to the drugs 5-MeO-DiPT, DiPT, and MiPT.

This substance has no history of human usage prior to the 1985 publication of its synthesis and pharmacology in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry by Repke, Grotjahn, & Shulgin. In modern times it is used as a recreational drug and an entheogen, rarely sold on the streets and almost exclusively obtained as a grey area research chemical through the use of online vendors.

The mechanism that produces the hallucinogenic and entactogenic effects of 5-MeO-MiPT is thought to result primarily from 5-HT2A receptor agonism, although additional mechanisms of action such as inhibition of MAO may also be involved.

The 5-MeO-MiPT experience contains a complex and wide array of effects which based on the predefined potential subjective effects index found [here](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effects_index), I will now begin to breakdown and describe.

**Physical Effects:**

The physical effects of 5-MeO-MIPT can be broken down into three components all of which progressively intensify proportional to dosage. These are described below and generally include:

- **Spontaneous tactile sensations** - the body high of 5-MeO-MIPT can be described as a pleasurable, warm, soft and all encompassing glow. There is also a cold, sharp tingling sensation that is manifested spontaneously at different unpredictable points throughout the trip but for others it can maintain a consistent presence that steadily rises with the onset and hits its limit once the peak has been reached.
- **Stimulation** and **Sedation** - in terms of its effects on the physical energy levels of the tripper, 5-MeO-MIPT can be both sedating and stimulating. The physical energy levels seem to manifest themselves in waves in an unpredictable pattern. This seems to be partially setting dependant and during physically strenuous situations such as running or dancing it can become stimulating and energetic. In contrast however, in calm environments such as darkened rooms with comfortable seating it can become relaxing, peaceful and even moderately sedating.
- **Nausea** - as the tripper begins to come up, nausea is not uncommon and can sometimes result in initial vomiting, but passes once this over or the trip begins to fully set in. In comparison to other psychedelics such as psilocin, LSD, and 2C-E, this could actually be very considered very mild in its intensity. In comparison to 5-MeO-DIPT, this substance has a much lower tendency to trigger unpleasant physical reactions and has been described as much less physically stimulating.

**Cognitive Effects:**

The head space of 5-MeO-MIPT is described by many as one which is both insightful and moderately relaxing, but at some points quite stimulating. This substance produces a large number of general psychedelic cognitive effects. The most prominent of these effects generally include:**
**

- **Introspection** - this component is consistently manifested only in the context of a non social setting in which the user is alone.
- **Increased empathy, love and sociability** - this component is consistently manifested only in the context of social settings in which one is within the company of others. These feelings of sociability, love and empathy are a little weaker and less sharp than those found on substances such as MDMA and 2C-B but still prove strong enough to provide long lasting therapeutic effects.
- **Acceleration of thought**
- **Connectivity of thought**
- **Time distortion**
- **Feelings of fascination, importance and awe**
- **Conceptual thinking**
- **Enhancement of current mind state**
- **Removal of cultural filter**
- **Ego suppression, loss and death**

**Visual Effects:**

*Enhancements*

5-MeO-MIPT presents a complete array of possible visual enhancements which generally include:

- **Increased visual acuity**
- **Enhancement of colours**
- **Enhanced pattern recognition**

*Distortions*

As for visual distortions and alterations, these generally include:

- **Visual drifting** (*melting, breathing, warping and flowing*) - In comparison to other psychedelics, this effect can be described as highly detailed, slow and smooth in motion and static in appearance.
- **Tracers**
- **After images**
- **Texture repetition**
- **Colour shifting**
- **Scenery slicing**

*Geometry*

The visual geometry that is present throughout this trip can be described as more similar in appearance to that of psilocin, 4-AcO-DMT, or ayahuasca than that of LSD or 2C-B. They can be comprehensively described as structured in their organization, organic in geometric style, intricate in complexity, large in size, fast and smooth in motion, colourful in scheme, glossy in colour, equal in blurred and sharp edges, and equal in rounded and angular corners. At higher dosages, they are significantly more likely to result in states of level 7B visual geometry over level 7A.

In terms of their manifestation, they are progressive in nature and continuously self-complexify in settings with little to no visual input and disturbances. For example, darkness will cause the geometry to progressively intensify, but this can immediately be reset back down to base level by simply turning on a bright light or actively performing a physical task which requires any level of concentration.

*Hallucinatory States*

5-MeO-MIPT produces a full range of high level hallucinatory states in a fashion that is more consistent and reproducible than that of many other commonly used psychedelics.

These effects generally include:

- **External hallucinations**
- **Internal hallucinations** - in comparison to other psychedelics such as LSD, 5-MeO-MIPT is extremely high in hallucinations embedded within visual geometry. This particular effect commonly contains hallucinations with with scenarios, settings, concepts and autonomous entity contact. They are more common within dark environments and can be described as internal in their manifestation, lucid in believability, interactive in style and almost exclusively of religious, spiritual, mystical or a transcendental nature in their overall theme.

**Auditory Effects:**

The auditory effects of 5-MeO-MIPT are common in their occurrence and exhibit a full range of effects which commonly include:

- **Auditory enhancements**
- **Auditory distortions**
- **Auditory hallucinations**

**Differences in Methods of Consumption:**

This substance can be taken via oral ingestion or it can be smoked. When ingested orally, the experience puts more of an emphasis on visual effects but can be broken up into two stages. The first half of the trip feels stimulating and entactogenic while the second half feels more similar to a traditional typtamine psychedelic.

If smoked, however, these stages of experience are not present and the experience places more of an emphasis on physically and cognitively stimulating effects accompanied by subtle and mild changes in visual perception.

**Health Effects, Addiction Potential, and Tolerance:**

The toxicity of 5-MeO-MiPT is not known but (as with all research chemicals doses) should be carefully weighed on an accurate milligram scale and users should take extreme caution to work their way up from threshold dosages. There are many reports of vasoconstriction and uncomfortable increases in heart rate and this should be taken into account.

5-MeO-MIPT and MAOIs are a potentially dangerous combination. It is likely that MAOIs could increase the effects of 5-MeO-MIPT unpredictably. Taking this chemical while under the influence of ayahuasca, harmala alkaloids, AMT and prescription MAOIs (such as certain antidepressants) is strongly discouraged.

5-MeO-MIPT is not physically addictive and many users experience a frequency self-regulating quality to the drug. Tolerance seems to be very moderate and does not build up without repeated use over a short period of time.

**Legal Issues:**

- **USA:** 5-MeO-MIPT is technically not scheduled in the United States, but could be considered an analogue of 5-MeO-DMT and therefore a Schedule I drug.
- **UK:** 5-MeO-MiPT is a Class A drug in the United Kingdom as are most ethers of ring-hydroxy tryptamines.
- **Romania:** 5-MeO-MIPT and other derivatives are illegal in Romania as of January 2011.
- **Japan:** 5-MeO-MIPT is controlled as a “Designated Substance” (Shitei-Yakubutsu) by the Pharmaceutical Affairs Law, making it illegal to possess or sell.

**Conclusion:**

5-MeO-MiPT is an extremely interesting and powerful substance and can be considered as the most useful and therapeutic entactogenic experience found with the tryptamine compunds. For those who are familiar with them, the overall effects of this substance can be described as mixture between ayahuasca, MDMA, psilocin and 5-MeO-DMT.

5-MeO-MIPT
 
Basics
 
by Erowid
 
DESCRIPTION #
 
5-MeO-MIPT is one of the less common psychedelic tryptamines that was developed by Alexander Shulgin in the 1980s. It shares some similarities with 5-MeO-DIPT (Foxy Methoxy). One of the isopropyl groups of 5-MeO-MIPT is simply exchanged by a one carbon (methyl) chain resulting in the most active asymmetrically N-methyl N-isopropyl substitution pattern. 
 
[ [Main 5-MeO-MIPT Vault](https://erowid.org/5meo_mipt.shtml) ]
 
[Dose](https://erowid.org/5meo_mipt_dose.shtml) #
 
A standard oral dose of 5-MeO-MIPT is between 2 and 7 mg.
 
Price #
 
In 2015, 5-MeO-MIPT is sold for between \$50 - \$125 USD per gram at single gram prices. Prices are higher for lower amounts. As with any recreational substance, single dose (7-10mg) prices at events are dependent on the market, but are usually in the \$10-20 range.
 
[Law](https://erowid.org/5meo_mipt_law.shtml) #
 
5-MeO-MIPT is not specifically controlled in the United States, but could be considered an Analogue of 5-MeO-DIPT, a Schedule I drug, if it were intended for human use.
 
Chemistry #
 
N-isopropyl-5-methoxy-N-methyl-tryptamine (5-MeO-MiPT) is a synthetic chemical tryptamine and thus is structurally related to other tryptamines (natural and synthetic), such as 5-MeO-DMT, N,N-DMT, psiloc(yb)in and serotonin.

History #
 
The first publication of the synthesis and pharmacology of this compound was in 1985 in Journal of Medicinal Chemistry by Repke, Grotjahn & Shulgin [ [article](https://erowid.org/references/refs_view.php?ID=6540) ].
 
Terminology / Slang #
 
The Substance:
 
5-MeO-MIPT.
 
The Experience:
 
Tripping.
 
[EFFECTS](https://erowid.org/5meo_mipt_effects.shtml) #
 
Oral 5-MeO-MIPT has some similarities with 5-MeO-DIPT. Users have reported aphrodisiac effects, minor changes in visual perception, mental stimulation, new perspectives, feelings of insight, emotional shifts, muscle tension, and mild tremor. The body load seems to be milder than with 5-MeO-DIPT. Sometimes there is a tendency of dreamy separation of mind and body as with 5-MeO-DMT. With the smoking route, more visuals and a "rush" are reported.
 
Onset #
 
Depending on how much and how recently the user has eaten, oral 5-MeO-MIPT generally takes 10-20 minutes to start to take effect. Smoked freebase usually comes on within seconds.
 
Duration #
 
Due to the small number of reports and a wide variation in reported durations for this chemical, it is difficult to give reliable estimates of length of action. Some users have reported effects completely abating within 4-6 hours, while others have reported residual stimulation and inability to sleep for several additional hours.
 
Visual Effects #
 
Visuals Summary Needed.
 
PROBLEMS #
 
Some users report unpleasant body effects or "body load". Unpleasant stomach effects, gastro-intestinal distress (diarrhea, cramps & gas) are not uncommon. In some cases there are difficulties with falling asleep for some hours after having returned to baseline, but there is less stimulation and body load than with 5-MeO-DIPT. There are cases of cardiac problems (tachycardia and pain), especially after high doses (over 10 mg). Other possible negative effects are difficult experiences as possible with nearly all psychedelics. The [Psychedelic Crisis FAQ](https://erowid.org/psychoactives/faqs/psychedelic_crisis_faq.shtml) addresses some of the issues involved in dealing with a difficult trip.
 
Contraindications #
 
- 5-MeO-MIPT and MAOIs are a potentially dangerous combination. It is likely that MAOIs could increase the effects of 5MeO-MIPT unpredictably. Taking this chemical while on prescription MAOIs is strongly discouraged. MAOIs are most commonly found in the prescription anti-depressants Nardil (phenelzine), Parnate (tranylcypromine), Marplan (isocarboxazid), Eldepryl (l-deprenyl), and Aurorex or Manerix (moclobemide). Ayahuasca also contains MAOIs (harmine and harmaline). Check with your doctor if you are not sure whether your prescription medication is an MAOI. Do not operate heavy machinery. Do Not Drive. Individuals currently in the midst of emotional or psychological upheaval in their everyday lives should be careful about choosing to use psychedelics such as 5-MeO-MIPT as they can trigger even more difficulty. Individuals with a family history of schizophrenia or early onset mental illness should be extremely careful because psychedelics have been known to trigger latent psychological and mental problems. Combining multiple psychoactive tryptamines, such as taking 4-oxygenated tryptamines (e.g. psilocybin, 4-AcO-DIPT, 4-AcO-MIPT) with 5-oxygenated ones such as 5-MeO-MIPT or 5-MeO-DIPT, may lead to unexpected potentiation of the action of each substance. This means that low doses of each, in combination, may produce an unexpectedly strong action. Individuals with seizure or convulsive disorders or heart problems may be at higher risk for health problems when taking psychedelics. Diabetics should monitor their blood sugar closely, as there have been some reports of problems.
 
Addiction Potential #
 
As with most psychedelics 5-MeO-MIPT seems to be neither physically addicting nor likely to cause psychological dependence. But As with most substances, some people will use it more frequently than they are comfortable with. There is a short period of tolerance after 5-MeO-MIPT use. Using it two days in a row is likely to lead to a diminished experience the second day, though spaced 5-7 or more days apart, this effect is nearly non-existent.

DESCRIPTION #
 
The effects of 5-MeO-MIPT (oral) have been described as somewhere between the effects of 5-MeO-DIPT (Foxy) and 5-MeO-DMT, without being a combination of the two. Reported effects vary dramatically from sleepy to speedy and from sense enhancing to mind-numbing. 
 
 Users describe a speedy body load, predominantly at the beginning of the experiment and a kind of 5-MeO-DMT like dissociation rather at the end. The turned on body load in some people enhances erotic qualities as with 2-CB or 5-MeO-DIPT (Foxy). Some visual effects are reported, especially at higher doses (10 mg and above). Enhanced pleasure when listening to music seems to be common. 
 
 In many cases, 5-MeO-MIPT in rather low doses up to 5 mgs is reported to be smooth, relaxing, friendly and sense enhancing. It is reported to produce emotionally lability. Some experience the coming up period as being somewhat cold and shivery. To prevent dehydration drink a lot during the experiment. 
 
 Smoked, it can produce a rush including trippiness. Visual effects are more often reported when smoked than after oral ingestion. The acute rushing phase lasts about 30 min and then declines slowly producing a trippy feeling for the next few hours, with baseline reached in 6-7 hrs. So the total duration of smoked-5-MeO-MIPT is comparable to an oral dose experiment in higher doses. 
 
 As with other entheogens, it is unsafe to drive or use dangerous equipment with 5-MeO-MIPT because it affects attention span, visual acuity, concentration, and coordination.

Erowid's effects information is a summary of data gathered from users, research, and other resources. This information is intended to describe the range of effects people report experiencing. Effects may vary dramatically from one person to another or one experience to another based on a variety of factors such as body chemistry, age, gender, physical health, dose, form of material, etc.

Caution : All legal information should be verified through other sources. [ see below ]
 
**U.S. FEDERAL LEGAL SUMMARY**
**5-MeO-MIPT**
- REGULATED: No
- STATUS: Not Approved ForHuman Consumption
- SCHEDULE: Possible Analog
 
5-MeO-MIPT is uncontrolled in the United States. This means it is generally considered legal to buy, possess, and distribute (sell, trade or give). It is possible that it could be considered an analog (of [5-MeO-DIPT](https://erowid.org/chemicals/5meo_dipt/5meo_dipt.shtml) , in which case, sales for human consumption or possession with the intent to ingest could be prosecuted under the [Federal Analogue Act](https://erowid.org/psychoactives/law/analog/analog.shtml) though we are unaware of any existing federal cases. (Jul 7 2005) 
 
 The DEA has stated in their [March 2005 issue of Microgram](http://www.dea.gov/programs/forensicsci/microgram/mg0305/mg0305.html) , that "5-MeO- MiPT is controlled (Schedule I) as an analogue of 5-methoxy-N,N-diisopropyltryptamine (5-MeO-DIPT, also known as 'Foxy-Methoxy')."
 
U.S. STATE LAW #

## SYNTHESIS

## DOSAGE

## DURATION

## QUALITATIVE COMMENTS
(with 4 mg, orally) âUp very fast, to a +2 in an hour. Absolutely no visuals, but over the next two hours an ease of interpretive fantasy, almost dream-like, and easy eroticism. Food tasted marvelous, but there was no appetite. Easy, normal sleep and good spirits in the a.m.â

(with 5 mg, orally) âExtremely bitter taste. Some stimulation and tingling at 10 minutes, and I am apprehensive at this rapid onset. There are no visual symptoms at all, but the stimulation of conceptual thought is intense. Depth perception is slightly altered and a very minor wave pattern can be noticed in the peripheral vision, but no major object or color distortion. Minor enhancement of auditory acuity. Philosophical concepts about this and other substances seem important. I wonder what the value of writing about, or attempting to describe, their effects really is. At the second hour, the effects are subsiding, and for another three hours there are tailings and insomnia, but I am able to eat normally. There is a certain amount of ânegativityâ about this compound. The dose is satisfyingly small, but I wonder if it is worth it. Somewhat of a disappointment. Have no desire to experiment further.â

(with 6 mg, orally) âRapid development to 45 minutes, some shakes, uneven handwriting, and hints of time slowing. Extremely erotic. Full plateau at a +3 at the 2 1/2 hr. point, then a graceful and rather rapid drop. Easy, restful sleep. Absolutely no visuals or related sensory effectsâwhat does one call this stoned state? Very pleasant, music extremely acceptable, tactile extraordinary. I feel that higher dosages would not contribute anything more.â

(with 12 mg, smoked) "I was able to take 4 or 5 puffs, and to hold off the onset until then, then I couldnât anymore. Powerful, tremendous rush, but all along maintaining body-ego awareness, unlike 5-MeO-DMT where the world appears to utterly dissolve. I was aware of doing a lot of groaning, writhing, shaking around; headphones and eyeshades kept it completely internal. Not too much visual, but lots of disorientation. Early on there was a lot of emotional lability, laughing, crying, âOh Godâ kinds of outbursts.

"At an hour and a half, I was down enough that I tried smoking the remainder of the bowl without much additional effect. A typical psychedelic afterglow and in the morning ate a big breakfast and felt essentially normal. In summary, I took too little, I was in a bad mood, and felt myself to be in a rushed environment. The experience seemed to me like a hybrid between CZ-74 and 5-MeO-DMT; the trippiness of the former and the rush (although not as intense) of the latter."

(with 20 mg, smoked) "Most all of it was smoked in about three or four inhalations before I felt it coming on so strongly that I lay down. Within less than a minute after I lay down, with my eyes closed, my visual field was filled with brilliant geometric patterned lines of different colors that were slowly moving. There were several sets of parallel and curved lines superimposed upon in each other. Soon after that, probably within a minute or two, I became extremely disoriented from my normal sense of being a person in a body; I was lost in an undifferentiated mass of feeling and non-specific sensation. It was similar to the overwhelming feeling of 5-MeO-DMT in quality and, as with that material, the peak phase lasted less than 30 minutes.

"Then I began to think more coherently, but intense waves would return every 5 to 15 minutes. In between my perception and thinking would be fairly normal, but with the waves I would be swept up in imagery or memories heavily laden with emotional content. After two hours I was joined by my wife. We spent some very intimate time together, and I remember asking her who she was and she replied, âYour wife.â This was very powerful to me since I did not really know what it meant, except that it seemed to be the best combination of mother, lover and friend, and that it was an entirely new kind of relationship that we would be creating for the rest of our lives together.

âAfter three or four hours, the waves had virtually stopped, and I remained oriented to the present and my immediate surroundings. I stayed under a mild influence until I ate supper, around 7 hours. I felt tired, had trouble falling asleep, but awoke refreshed.â


## EXTENSIONS AND COMMENTARY
The last two entries in the âQualitative Commentsâ section are longer than usual, but even at that they have been trimmed down from reports sent to me that were each of over three pages in length. A thread common to each of them, is the comparison of the effects of smoking 5-MeO-MIPT to those from smoking 5-MeO-DMT. The speed of onset, the intense depersonalization and loss of immediate contact with oneâs surroundings, the impressive recall of early memories and the significance of these memories, make the drugs appear similar to one another. And the fact that they are of similar potency when smoked (5-MeO-DMT is perhaps a tad more potent) makes the relationship more comfortable. And then, with the eye of a chemist making further comparisons, the whole structure-activity relationship falls into place. The formulae are identical, except that one of the N-methyl groups of 5-MeO-DMT is extended by a couple of carbon atoms, to an isopropyl group in 5-MeO-DIPT. They are almost the same. They have almost the same action when smoked. They are âunique and similarâ and together they appear to be quite different from the rest of the pack. Nope, that is just not so! They are totally different from one another.

All you need to do, to see that clearly, is to look at that one additional observation involving oral activity. This drug, 5-MeO-MIPT, is several times more potent when taken orally than it is when smoked. 5-MeO-DMT is much less active orally than when it is smoked. As a matter of fact, it is not active at all when taken orally. No active oral level has ever been found. What a rich area for speculation. Preferential metabolism? First pass goings-on? Chemical change from pyrolysis in the pipe? Different receptors? Lipophilicity? I am reminded of the quote from Mark Twain; âI like science because it gives one such a wholesome return of conjecture from such a trifling investment of fact.â

Might the observations of the remaining oxygen-substituted MIPTâs provide additional clues? There are four possible mono-methoxylated MIPTâs; all have been synthesized and all have been explored in man. The 4-methoxy-isomer was of modest activity and deserves, and has received, a recipe of its own. The 5-methoxy- isomer is the one described here, and is extremely potent (orally, but less so parenterally). But as one goes to the 6- and 7-positional isomers, the two remaining positions, the psychopharmacological activity seems to be lost. This is a humorous reminder of the British idiom, to be at 6-âs and 7-âs about something.

6-MeO-MIPT was made from the corresponding indole, by reaction with 2-nitroethyl acetate, the resulting 3-nitroethylindole catalytically hydrogenated to 6-MeO-T which was converted to the N-benzyloxycarbonyl derivative. This was reduced to 6-MeO-NMT which was in turn reductively coupled with acetone to provide 6-MeO-MIPT with a melting point of 89â91 Â°C and in an overall yield of 9%. MS (in m/z): C5H12N+ 86(100%); indolemethylene+ 160 (7%); parent ion 246 (4%). In human trials there was one report of some kind of neurological twinge at a 16 milligram level, but nothing else at trials of up to 50 milligrams and it has been shelved as being inactive.

The isomeric 7-MeO-MIPT was synthesized by the exact same five-step reaction sequence starting with 7-methoxyindole, in an overall yield of 24%. The actual reaction conditions for this conversion are detailed in the recipe for 4-MeO-MIPT. The mp of 7-MeO-MIPT was 72â73 Â°C and its MS (in m/z): C5H12N+ 86 (100%); indolemethylene+ 160 (5%); parent ion 246 (4%). Gas chromatographic analysis indicated that the product was only 80% pure, and three of the impurities were identified. One was 7-MeO-NIPT with MS (in m/z): C4H10N+ 72 (100%); indolemethylene+ 161/160 (13, 8%); parent ion 232 (4%). Another was 7-MeO-DMT with MS (in m/z): C3H8N+ 58 (100%); indolemethylene+ 160 (6%); parent ion 218 (9%). The third was 7-MeO-NMT with MS (in m/z): C2H6N+ 44 (100%); indolemethylene+ 161/160 (82, 39%); parent ion 204 (5%). These three impurities represented approximately 5%, 3%, and 4%, resp., of the isolated productâs final weight. It showed something going on at 20 mg orally with perhaps a little distortion in the visual field. And, separately, at 70 milligrams orally there might have been a light-headedness after a few minutes. Nothing more. It, too, has been given the kiss of death by being declared inactive at the 50 milligram level.

The last of the Mohicans, the tribe of compounds with the remarkably potent, orally active, N-methyl-N-isopropyl system on the tryptamine nitrogen atom, was the dimethoxy analogue with both the 5- and the 6-positions occupied with methoxy groups. This specific compound has its own recipe as it raises specific questions that deserve direct attention. The very close relative with the methylenedioxy group at this 5,6-location also has a separate recipe.

Two final laments. Remember that all these beautiful compounds are unique. Why do they behave the way they behave? I have no idea and there is never enough data to explain everything. I hate the fact that the word data is plural. But singular or plural keep collecting it (them), and keep trying to make sense of everything. And, a small point from my infancy. The Last of the Mohicans was one of the very first books I read, and I had very innocently accepted the footwear footware of these Indians as being the metaphor for the people themselves. I had seen that title as having been, âThe Last of the Moccasins.â This is a pair of words that I still interchange without any defense, along with shoulder and soldier, avatar and atavar, and especially annoying when lecturing, irrelevant and irreverent.

**5-Methoxy-N-methyl-N-isopropyltryptamine** (also known as **5-MeO-MiPT** and **moxy** ) is a lesser-known [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) substance of the [tryptamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tryptamine) class. 5-MeO-MiPT is chemically related to tryptamines like [5-MeO-DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/5-MeO-DMT) and [5-MeO-DiPT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/5-MeO-DiPT) . It produces its psychoactive effects through activity at [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) [receptors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Receptors) in the brain.

The synthesis and pharmacology of 5-MeO-MiPT was first reported in 1985 by David Repke and Alexander Shulgin. Its effects in humans was documented in Shulgin's book [TiHKAL](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/TiHKAL) ("Tryptamines I Have Known and Loved").

Anecdotal reports describe 5-MeO-MiPT's effects as highly [stimulating](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulating) and mildly [entactogenic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entactogenic) , lacking in typical psychedelic visual distortions. Many users report strong physical and tactile effects that serve to [enhance libido](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_libido) and sexual pleasure. An unpleasant "body load" is also often reported at common to high doses, marked by muscle tension and nausea.

Very little is known about the pharmacological properties, metabolism and toxicity of 5-MeO-MiPT, and it has a limited history of human use. It has been sold online as a [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) . It is highly advised to use harm reduction practices when using this substance.

## Chemistry

5-MeO-MiPT, or 5-methoxy-N-methyl-N-isopropyltryptamine, is a synthetic indole alkaloid molecule of the [tryptamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tryptamine) class. Tryptamines share a core structure comprised of a bicylic indole heterocycle attached at R 3 to an amino group via an ethyl side chain. 5-MeO-MiPT is substituted at R 5 of its indole heterocycle with a methoxy (MeO) functional group CH 3 O−; it also contains a methyl group and an isopropyl chain bound to the terminal amine R N of its tryptamine backbone (MiPT).

5-MeO-MiPT is the N-substituted isopropyl homologue of [5-MeO-DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/5-MeO-DMT) .

## Pharmacology

5-MeO-MiPT's [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) effects are believed to come from its efficacy at the [5-HT2A receptor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin#The_5-HT_system) as a [partial agonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist#Agonists) and additional mechanisms of action such as the inhibition of [MAO](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MAOI) (i.e. digestive enzymes in the stomach) have also been speculated upon, though this has yet to be demonstrated scientifically. While 5-MeO-MiPT binds most strongly to 5-HT1A receptors, It might act as a moderately potent serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor but other studies have not found significant action at the monoamine transporters . These mechanisms may help explain why there are many anecdotal reports of anti-depressant and anxiolytic effects from modest doses of this compound. For example, SNRIs such as venlafaxine are commonly prescribed to treat depression, and the 5-HT1A agonist buspirone is prescribed primarily for treatment of anxiety.

## Subjective effects

5-MeO-MiPT can be taken via oral ingestion or it can be smoked. When ingested orally, the visual and sensory effects are reported to become more prominent. The experience can be broken up into two stages; the first half feels [stimulating](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) and [entactogenic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entactogens) whilst the second half feels more similar to a traditional [tryptamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tryptamine) [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) like psilocybin mushrooms or LSD. When smoked, the physically and cognitively stimulating effects become emphasized.

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)** - At doses below 10 to 15mg, 5-MeO-MiPT produces a degree of stimulation comparable to that of [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) .
- **[Spontaneous bodily sensations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_bodily_sensations)** - The "body high" of 5-MeO-MiPT can be described as a pleasurable, warm, soft and all-encompassing glow. This may be accompanied by a cold, sharp tingling sensation that manifests spontaneously at different unpredictable points throughout the experience, although for others can maintain a consistent presence that steadily rises with the onset and hits its limit once the peak has been reached.
- **[Nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea)** - Nausea is commonly reported and can sometimes result in vomiting, although it typically fades after the come up phase. In comparison to [5-MeO-DiPT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/5-MeO-DiPT) , this substance has a much lower tendency to trigger unpleasant physical reactions.

- **[Dehydration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dehydration)**
- **[Stomach bloating](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stomach_bloating)** - At higher doses, this compound can induce severe stomach bloating within those who are susceptible. This can be partially to fully mitigated through the use of antacids.
- **[Pupil dilation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pupil_dilation)**
- **[Vasoconstriction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction)**
- **[Diarrhea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Diarrhea)** ### Visual effects
 
- #### Enhancements
 
- **[Colour enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_enhancement)**
- **[Pattern recognition enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition_enhancement)**
- **[Visual acuity enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_acuity_enhancement)**
 
#### Distortions
 
- **[Drifting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_drifting)** *( [Melting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_drifting#Melting) , [Breathing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_drifting#Breathing) , [Warping](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_drifting#Warping) and [Flowing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_drifting#Flowing) )* - In comparison to other psychedelics, this effect can be described as highly detailed, slow and smooth in motion and static in appearance.
- **[Tracers](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tracers)**
- **[After images](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/After_images)**
- **[Symmetrical texture repetition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Symmetrical_texture_repetition)**
- **[Colour shifting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_shifting)**
- **[Scenery slicing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenery_slicing)**
 
#### Geometry
 
The visual geometry produced by 5-MeO-MiPT can be described as more similar in appearance to that of [Psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) , [4-AcO-DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-AcO-DMT) or [ayahuasca](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ayahuasca) than that of [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) or [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) . It can be comprehensively described through its [variations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Geometry#Variations) as intricate in complexity, abstract in form, organic in feel, brightly lit, multicoloured in scheme, glossy in shading, equal in blurred and sharp edges, large in size, fast in speed, smooth in motion, equal in rounded and angular corners, non-immersive in depth and progressive in intensity. At higher dosages they are significantly more likely to result in states of [level 8B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/8B_Geometry) visual geometry over [level 8A](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/8A_Geometry) .
 
#### Hallucinatory states
 
5-MeO-MiPT produces a full range of high level hallucinatory states in a fashion that is more consistent and reproducible than that of many other commonly used psychedelics.
 
- **[Transformations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Transformations)**
- **[Internal hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucination)** ( *[autonomous entities](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Autonomous_entities)* ; *[settings, sceneries, and landscapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Settings,_sceneries,_and_landscapes)* ; *[perspective hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perspective_hallucinations)* and *[scenarios and plots](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenarios_and_plots)* ) - In comparison to other psychedelics such as [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) , 5-MeO-MiPT is extremely high in hallucinations at appropriate dosages. These are more common in darkness and can be comprehensibly described through their [variations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Internal_hallucinations#Variations) as lucid in believability, interactive in style, new experiences in content, autonomous in controllability, geometry-based in style and almost exclusively of a personal, religious, spiritual, science-fiction, fantasy, surreal, nonsensical or transcendental nature in their overall theme. ### Cognitive effects
 
- At low to moderate doses, the cognitive effects of 5-MeO-MiPT are often described by many as both insightful and moderately relaxing, but at some points quite stimulating. 5-MeO-MiPT produces a large number of typical [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) cognitive effects which progressively intensify proportional to dosage. At higher dosages, however, it becomes primarily sedating and impairing with [depersonalization](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depersonalization) and no accompanying insight. 
- **[Analysis enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Analysis_enhancement)**
- **[Empathy, affection, and sociability enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Empathy,_affection,_and_sociability_enhancement)** - This effect is consistently manifested only in the context of social settings in which one is within the company of others. These feelings of sociability, love and empathy are a little weaker and less sharp than those found on substances such as [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) and [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) but still prove strong enough to provide long-lasting therapeutic effects.
- **[Depersonalization](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depersonalization)** - Unlike most traditional psychedelics, 5-MeO-MiPT can cause extreme depersonalization and dissociation for some users throughout the duration of the experience.
- **[Conceptual thinking](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Conceptual_thinking)**
- **[Increased music appreciation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_music_appreciation)**
- **[Emotion enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Emotion_enhancement)**
- **[Increased libido](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_libido)** - increased libido and significantly enhanced orgasms are reported
- **[Memory suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Memory_suppression)**

### Experience reports

There are currently no anecdotal reports which describe the effects of this compound within our [experience index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Experience_index) . Additional experience reports can be found here:

- [Erowid Experience Vaults: 5-MeO-MiPT](https://www.erowid.org/experiences/subs/exp_5MeOMIPT.shtml)

## Reagent results

Exposing compounds to the reagents gives a colour change which is indicative of the compound under test. The following test results are from [ProTestKit](https://www.protestkit.eu/results/) .

## Toxicity and harm potential

Almost nothing is known about the long-term effects of 5-MeO-MiPT. Alongside of this, the exact toxic dosage is unknown. This is because 5-MeO-MiPT is a [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) with very little history of human use.

A preliminary study on mice has shown that a normal dose of 5-MeO-MiPT (0.27 mg/kg) was unable to produce any measurable toxic effects. However, doses of 5-MeO-MiPT way above the normal dosage range (2.7 mg/kg) have been shown to produce cell toxicity by triggering programmed cell death in the brain, liver and kidneys. The extent of the damage, if it occurs in other bodily tissues as well and how it is caused is not known yet.

Anecdotal evidence from people within the community who have tried 5-MeO-MiPT suggests that there are no negative health effects attributed to simply trying the drug by itself at low to moderate doses and using it very sparingly (but nothing can be completely guaranteed). [Independent research](https://www.google.com/) should always be done to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe before consumption.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this drug.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

5-MeO-MiPT is not habit-forming, and the desire to use it can actually decrease with use. It is most often self-regulating.

Tolerance to the effects of 5-MeO-MiPT is built almost immediately after ingestion. After that, it takes about 3 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 7 days to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). 5-MeO-MiPT presents cross-tolerance with all [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) , meaning that after the consumption of 5-MeO-MiPT all psychedelics will have a reduced effect.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **2C-T-X** - Both classes of compounds can be unpredictable alone.
- **2C-X** - The 5-MeO psychedelics can interact unpredictably to potentiate other psychedelics.
- **Cannabis** - May increase the risk of negative psychological effects such as [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) .
- **DOx** - The 5-MeO class of tryptamines can be unpredictable in their interactions, particularly increasing the risk of unpleasant physical side effects.
- **MDMA** - Some of the 5-MeO tryptamines are a bit unpredictable and should be mixed with MDMA with care.
- **Mescaline** - The 5-MeO class of tryptamines can be unpredictable in their interactions.
- **NBOMe** - The 5-MeO class of tryptamines can be unpredictable in their interactions and the NBOMes are known to be unpredictable even alone. This combination is best avoided.
- **Amphetamines** - The anxiogenic and focusing effects of stimulants increase the chance of unpleasant thought loops. The combination is generally unnecessary because of the stimulating effects of psychedelics.
- **Cocaine** - The anxiogenic and focusing effects of stimulants increase the chance of unpleasant thought loops. The combination is generally unnecessary because of the stimulating effects of psychedelics.
- **DXM** - Little information exists about this combination.
- **Tramadol** - Increased risk of [serotonin syndrome](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome) .
- **aMT** - Increased risk of [serotonin syndrome](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome) .
- **MAOIs** - Increased risk of [serotonin syndrome](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome) .
- **PCP** - Little information exists about this combination. May increase risk of psychosis and excessive stimulation.

There are no known deaths from 5-MeO-MiPT but, as a [monoamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Monoamine) [reuptake inhibitor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Reuptake_inhibitor) (MRI) , injury could occur when excessive doses are taken or when it is taken with drugs such as [MAOIs](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MAOIs) , [RIMAs](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/RIMA) , [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) and any substance which act as a [releasing agent](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Releasing_agent) or [reuptake inhibitor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Reuptake_inhibitor) of [neurotransmitters](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurotransmitters) such as [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) and [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) .

5-MeO-MiPT is a psychedelic in the tryptamine class. It’s uncommon relative to LSD and psilocin, but it has been used for a couple of decades. It’s not a very visual substance at common doses. Instead, it’s known for producing greater tactile, bodily, and sexual effects than other psychedelics.

It’s part of the research chemical market and has been sold as itself and as a component of branded products.

---

5-MeO-MiPT = 5-Methoxy-N-methyl-N-isopropyltryptamine; Moxy

PubChem: 2763156

Molecular formula: C15H22N2O

Molecular weight: 246.354 g/mol

IUPAC: N-[2-(5-methoxy-1H-indol-3-yl)ethyl]-N-methylpropan-2-amine

---

## Dose

#### Oral

Light: 1 – 3 mg

Common: 3 – 8 mg

Strong: 8 – 12 mg

#### Inhalation

Common: 10 – 20 mg

---

The dose-response curve is steep, meaning a small increase can yield a substantial change in intensity. A couple milligrams may be all it takes to make an experience unpleasant and overwhelming. Since the drug is quite potent and responses vary between people, users should be careful with their dosing and initially take a light amount to evaluate their response.

A scale is needed for proper dosing, though typical milligram scales still won’t be ideal for measuring. Therefore, a scale should be used alongside volumetric dosing.

While some people find under 10 mg to be underwhelming, others find the same amount or less to be very uncomfortable.

Doses under 10 mg may be preferred for mood effects and physical euphoria, while higher doses are more likely to offer notable psychedelic effects.

---

## Timeline

#### Oral

Total: 3 – 6 hours

Onset: 00:15 – 00:45 (the onset is usually pretty fast)

It can produce an altered mental state and lingering insomnia for a few hours beyond the main duration.

Both immediately after the main effects end and in the following days it can produce an afterglow. Short-lasting positive after effects are more common than having it trigger depression or anxiety, though for many people the after effect period is neutral.

## Effects

**Psychological/Cognitive**

Overall, 5-MeO-MiPT is pretty unique among the psychedelics and has an effect profile that pulls from multiple drug classes.

It’s usually stimulating rather than sedating, though the stimulation is more physical than mental. Because of this, some users find engaging in activities like hiking or dancing is more comfortable than sitting still. Having an outlet for the physical energy may help to minimize jitteriness and a feeling of unease, but it’s also the case that other users dislike being active on it.

At common doses it’s not a very confusing or insightful substance, but it can have a moderate impact on your thinking and creativity. It’s been called a “shallower” psychedelic for this reason, though that shouldn’t be taken to mean it can’t trigger a distressing or useful experience.

Feelings of dissociation and dreaminess are often reported.

At high doses confusion and generally strange experiences are much more common. There are a few reports of people becoming unresponsive or having trouble talking, mainly at high doses.

It’s commonly promoted as a tryptamine alternative to MDMA, but this is almost always an exaggeration. There are some elements, like increased appreciation of others and pleasant tactile sensations, that could be comparable, but it’s not a full entactogen and has a much less reliable impact on mood and outlook.

The visual effects can be substantial at high doses, but at common amounts they’re quite limited. You can still receive color enhancement, changes to depth perception, and some movement like breathing, but very strong distortions or hallucinations are rare at these doses. People who are primarily interested in visual effects aren’t going to be very interested in it unless they can handle higher doses, which will often be physically unpleasant.

Because a minority of people do get substantial visuals while others never get them even at high doses, it’s been hypothesized that a metabolic difference could be at aply. There’s no proof of this, but it is true that the effects, visual and otherwise, vary a lot between people, as is often the case with psychedelics in general.

Sexual effects are attributed to the drug more often than with most psychedelics. Tactile enhancement combines with a higher sex drive and lower inhibition. It’s also easier for a male to get an erection than it is with entactogens, which also enhance tactile sensation. Orgasms can be more intense as well. Many reports describe sexual thoughts or sensations suddenly manifesting under the influence, even in situations that aren’t conducive to sexual activity. Those feelings can be ignored if needed and they don’t occur for everyone.

Music is often more impactful. Users report noticing aspects of songs that are normally ignored and music may also trigger physical sensations or visual distortions, more often with eyes closed. Music and sex are two of the main cases where people, at least those who respond well to the drug, will choose it in place of other psychedelics. Actual auditory distortions can be present as well, though they’re not always positive.

Because it doesn’t have a significant headspace and usually doesn’t produce strong visuals, the tactile and other sensory effects are some of the main positive aspects of the drug. If those aren’t present or sufficiently enjoyable, you may be disappointed. But when the experience is positive it can be one of the most enjoyable psychedelics.

Usually appetite is lowered, but the taste of food may be enhanced.

Some users report finding things more humorous than usual.

---

**Physical/Bodily**

Body load is very common and can ruin the experience when it’s significant. It can include nausea, over-excitation, vomiting, chills, lightheadedness, bloating, shivering, sensations of heat, tension, and headache. Feeling like you can’t breathe properly or like you’re experiencing a lot of cardiovascular stress can contribute to anxiety and panic.

These physical symptoms underlie a lot of the anxiogenic potential of the drug and are responsible for a large portion of the negative experiences. In the absence of those properties it doesn’t tend to cause much anxiety on its own. People are much more likely to become stressed due to feeling uncomfortable and being concerned about their physical safety.

It’s not an exaggeration to say it can feel horrible to an extent that’s largely not seen with other psychedelics. This isn’t the typical experience, but it’s a possibility, and it’s one of the reasons you need to be careful with your dosing.

On average, the come up is more uncomfortable than the peak and comedown.

Despite it having a notable body load, it can also come with physical euphoria and other positive bodily effects, sometimes concurrently with the aforementioned negatives. Tactile enhancement, such as things feeling softer or enjoying contact with other people, is very common. And even in the absence of external input, it can produce rushes of pleasurable sensations in the body. This same effect might be the cause of unpleasant coldness and heat for those who are perceiving the effect differently.

---

#### Combinations

Some people have reported successfully combining it with entactogens or psychedelics, though the reports vary, especially for entactogens. The safety of using 5-MeO-MiPT with entactogens is a bit unclear due to an incomplete understanding of its pharmacology, so it’s best to avoid using them together.

Combining psychedelics, though sometimes useful, less predictably raises the chance of confusion, anxiety, and other problematic mental effects. It’s best to avoid that combination.

## Chemistry

5-MeO-MiPT is a substituted tryptamine and an analog of 5-MeO-DiPT. The 5-methoxy substitution, in addition to causing changes to the effects, increases the potency of the substance compared to its parent compound, MiPT.

---

## Pharmacology

Like with DiPT, the 5-MeO substitution produces an increase in 5-HT2A affinity and activation potency. Early research was interpreted by some to mean it has substantial serotonin reuptake inhibition, but the research showed its IC50 value was over 6 μM, which isn’t very high (Nagai, 2007).

More recent research supports 5-MeO-MiPT primarily being a serotonin receptor agonist. It can activate 5-HT2A (shown by intracellular calcium increase) with an ED50 of 7.82 nM or 566 nM if looking at 5-HT2A beta-arrestin recruitment, which involves another signalling pathway (Blough, 2014). Blough (2014) showed it had no reuptake inhibition at SERT, NET, or DAT at up to 10 μM (10,000 nM).

Other studies have similarly shown the drug should be classified as a serotonin receptor agonist, much like other psychedelics (Ray, 2010; Rickli, 2016). The different effect profile, such as some entactogen-like mood states and tactile enhancement, doesn’t seem to be coming from monoamine release or reuptake inhibition.

---

#### Pharmacokinetics

5-MeO-MiPT is metabolized via multiple routes, yielding 5-MeO-NiPT, 5-HO-MiPT, HO-5-MeO-MiPT, 5-MeO-MiPT-N-oxide, and others (Grafinger, 2017; Katagi, 2010).

---

#### Tolerance

Few reports characterizing its tolerance are available, but it seems to produce less tolerance than the average psychedelic. There are some reports of it being successfully used on subsequent days.

Once tolerance is present it should largely go away within a week.

---

## History

#### 1980s

The first paper on 5-MeO-MiPT was published in 1985 by David Repke, Douglas Grotjahn, and Alexander Shulgin.

#### 2000s

Most of its use has occurred since the early to mid-2000s. It’s been sold through the research chemical market either as itself or as a component of branded “legal high” products.

#### 2005 – 2007

(Takahashi, 2008 ) – A Japanese paper described its presence in products purchased from stores and online between 2005 and 2007. Of the 178 products tested, 30 contained 5-MeO-MiPT.

#### 2013 – 2015

(Odoardi, 2016) – The contents of novel psychoactive substance (NPS) samples from 162 seizures in Italy were analyzed. One of those samples contained 5-MeO-MiPT, but it was present alongside methylone, ethylone, methedrone, 4-FA, and 5-MeO-DALT.

(Backberg, 2015) – Sweden’s STRIDA project was notified of 1243 cases of suspected NPS intoxication. Of those, the 59 cases testing positive for 3-MeO-PCP and/or 4-MeO-PCP were analyzed further. 52 showed signs of polydrug use, 17 of which involved 5-MeO-MiPT.

#### As of 2018

It is still sold through the research chemical market and through the dark web, but it isn’t one of the top psychedelics. It’s usually not explicitly illegal.

---

## Legality

#### United States

Unscheduled, but it could be treated as an illicit analog of 5-MeO-DiPT.

It is scheduled in Florida (Schedule 1), Louisiana (Schedule 1), and Minnesota (Schedule 1).

#### Australia

It could be treated as an illicit analog.

#### Canada

Unscheduled

#### UK

Class A

---

## Safety

Given the lack of information about the drug, it should be taken at common doses, infrequently, and without combinations.

Because of its apparent pharmacology and effects, it’s reasonable to assume agitation, confusion, panic, tachycardia, hypertension, hyperthermia, and temporary psychosis are possible outcomes. A few reports of toxicity support its ability to cause confusion and temporary psychosis.

The chance of negative effects can be reduced by taking common doses.

#### Risky Combinations (list is not exhaustive)

Stimulants, other psychedelics, MAOIs, and tramadol.

#### Adverse effect reports

(Grafinger, 2017) – Confusion and agitation after confirmed use.

- 32-year-old male. Found standing naked and without orientation in the street. 
- He had several abrasions all over his body. He reacted with agitation and aggression when approached by police, who were called to the seen by a friend who reported the male had taken an “LSD-like substance.”
- A blood sample was collected 1 hour after and a urine sample 2 hours after the police appeared on the scene.
- Toxicology confirmed 5-MeO-MiPT use 
- Blood: 160 ng/mL
- Urine: 3380 ng/mL

(Shimizu, 2007) – Combined intoxication with methylone and 5-MeO-MiPT. Confusion and cardiovascular stimulation were observed.

- 27-year-old male. Took approximately 200 mg (oral) of a drug believed to be methylone. Then he reported nausea and shouted with agitation, then fell down on the floor and was crying.
- At the ED, he stared incoherently and was silent in confusion, though he also exhibited sudden and brief psychomotor excitement and shouted for no reason. 
- Temp 37.8°C, HR 150, BP 144/81, dilated pupils and sweating.
- Continued to exhibit symptoms of psychomotor excitement 3.5 hours after ingestion. Symptoms later resolved and were seemingly helped by risperidone.
- The remaining powder was tested. 
- The analysis indicated it was ~60% methylone and ~38% 5-MeO-MiPT, meaning an estimated 120 mg methylone and 76 mg 5-MeO-MiPT may have been taken.
- COI: Not reported

(Itokawa, 2007) – Confusional state caused by 5-MeO-MiPT and 5-MeO-DiPT.

- 23-year-old female. She presented 6.5 hours after taking a liquid called “Ecstasy Liquid 2 Natural Type” to enhance sexual performance. 
- She became nauseous after taking it and vomited. Though she also took Love Boll (half of a tablet) about 1 hr after the liquid. Both drugs were obtained by her partner on the street.
- 2 hours after administration, she was speaking and repeating the same content without responding to her boyfriend. She also displayed excited and disorganized behavior. She walked around irritably, threw things, and shouted.
- Examination at hospital 
- Not alert or oriented. BP of 114/83. No motor deficit, tremor, or ataxia.
- Did not answer any questions. She was smirking and looking around restlessly.
- She was able to answer some questions 8 hrs after taking the liquid, but she was still confused about the date and season. 
- Incoherence and perplexity. Anterograde amnesia with ambiguous memory post-ingestion. Denied experiencing any auditory or visual hallucinations or delusions.
- Urine collected 8 hr post-ingestion 
- Toxicology showed both 5-MeO-DiPT and 5-MeO-MiPT.
- The authors of the paper had previously detected 5-MeO-DiPT from Love Boll and 5-MeO-MiPT from Ecstasy Liquid 2.
- COI: This work was supported by a Grant from the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (16242701).

(Matsumoto, 2006) – Link, along with 5-MeO-DiPT, to psychotic effects and a murder.

- 22-year-old male purchased three designer drugs online, “Foxy” “Wild Game” and “Mipty.” 
- He took Wild Game and Mipty together at an unknown dose along with his girlfriend.
- Soon after he had palpitations, nausea, and was fearing a bad trip, though he was still able to recognize his girlfriend.
- About 1.5 hours after ingestion, he perceived things delusionally, thought his surroundings were conveying ominous warnings, spiritual meanings, and important revelations. 
- Sensory distortion, visual illusion, and intermittent loss of consciousness were reported.
- Police officers found him naked and bloody at midnight near his apartment around 3 hours after intake. He was markedly confused and incoherent. 
- The police reported he killed his girlfriend just before the arrest.
- A container labeled “Mipty” was found in his room. Analysis confirmed the presence of 5-MeO-DiPT and 5-MeO-MiPT. Both substances were also found in his urine and in his girlfriend.
- Because Mipty contained both drugs and Wild Game was shown to just contain 5-MeO-DiPT, it’s possible the 5-MeO-DiPT exposure was greater.
- COI: Not reported

5-MeO-MiPT, also known as 5-methoxy-N-methyl-N-isopropyltryptamine or by its nickname Moxy, is an atypical psychedelic drug of the tryptamine and 5-methoxytryptamine families. It has unique and unusual effects compared to other psychedelic tryptamines. At low doses, its effects include stimulation, tactile and sexual enhancement, some MDMA-like entactogenic effects, and introspective and mild perceptual changes with few or no psychedelic visuals or time dilation, whereas at higher doses, it produces 5-MeO-DMT-like classical psychedelic effects. It is usually taken orally or smoked.
The drug acts as a non-selective serotonin receptor agonist, including of the serotonin 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, and 5-HT2C receptors, among others. It is closely related in chemical structure and effects to 5-MeO-DiPT, and is also related to other tryptamines like 5-MeO-DMT, 4-HO-MiPT, and MiPT.
5-MeO-MiPT was first described in the literature by Alexander Shulgin and David Repke and colleagues in 1985. It was later described by Shulgin in greater detail in his 1997 book TiHKAL (Tryptamines I Have Known and Loved). Recreational use of 5-MeO-MiPT is significant but relatively rare. It is often used as a substitute for 5-MeO-DiPT, which has similar effects but was became a controlled substance in the United States in 2003. The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) proposed banning 5-MeO-MiPT as well in the 2020s, but later withdrew its proposal amid public opposition. 5-MeO-MiPT, under the developmental code name MSD-001, is being developed for the treatment of psychiatric disorders by Mindstate Design Labs and is in phase 1 clinical trials for this purpose as of 2025.

## Use and effects

In his book TiHKAL (Tryptamines I Have Known and Loved), Alexander Shulgin lists the dose of 5-MeO-MiPT as 4 to 6 mg orally and 12 to 20 mg smoked. A wider recreational dose range of 0.5 to 20 mg or more orally has also been reported however. Oral doses of 1 to 3 mg have been described as light, 3 to 8 mg as common or moderate, and 8 to 12 mg as strong. Its onset of action when taken orally is described as very rapid, occurring within 15 to 45 minutes, peak effects appear to occur after around 1 to 2 hours, and its duration as 4 to 6 hours. However, other sources state its duration as 3 to 8 hours. A clinical trial confirmed that 5-MeO-MiPT has an onset of about 30 minutes and that peak effects occur after about 1.5 to 2 hours. Its duration smoked is said to be 2 to 5 hours.
5-MeO-MiPT has been described as having unique and unusual effects relative to other psychedelic tryptamines. The effects of 5-MeO-MiPT differ depending on whether it is taken orally or smoked and are highly dose-dependent. When taken orally at relatively low doses like 4 to 6 mg, it is usually described as not producing psychedelic visuals or related sensory effects and as producing only hints of time dilation. However, it is said to produce a stoned state that includes an ease of interpretive fantasy, dream-like perception, intense conceptual thought and philosophical thinking, and mild perceptual effects like altered depth perception, minor wave pattern in peripheral vision, and slightly enhanced auditory acuity. Moreover, the drug is described as producing stimulation, greatly enhanced tactile sensation and eroticism, enhanced music appreciation, tingling, shakes, and mild motor impairment. Its head space is described as relatively "shallow", less confusing, and more easily tolerated compared to classical psychedelics. Its effects have been described by users variably as both pleasant and negative.
When smoked, 5-MeO-MiPT is described as having effects similar in many regards to those of 5-MeO-DMT. These effects of smoked 5-MeO-MiPT include a powerful rush (but less intense than 5-MeO-DMT), loss of coherent thought, not much in the way of visuals, closed-eye visuals of moving and colored geometric patterns, intense waves of mental imagery of emotionally infused memories, impressive recall of early memories, intense depersonalization or disorientation of the normal sense of being a person in a body, loss of immediate contact with surroundings, emotional lability including laughing, crying, and vocal outbursts, groaning, writhing, shaking around, and general disorientation. It is described as having a very rapid onset, with the peak phase lasting less than 30 minutes and waves continuing for up to a few hours. It was described by one user as feeling like a hybrid between diethyltryptamine (DET) and 5-MeO-DMT.
5-MeO-MiPT is also known by its nickname "Moxy" and is closely related both in terms of chemical structure and effects to 5-MeO-DiPT (also known as "Foxy Methoxy"). These two serotonergic tryptamines at low doses have been described as very aphrodisiac and much more stimulant-like and party drugs than classical psychedelics. However, they have been described as not innately aphrodisiac, but instead as enhancing tactile sensation in a way that lends itself to sex. Matthew Baggott has described 5-MeO-MiPT as having some MDMA-like entactogenic effects at low doses, including tactile enhancement and feelings of empathy, intimacy, and closeness with others, and as producing classical psychedelic effects at higher doses.
Mindstate Design Labs has described 5-MeO-MiPT as the "least psychedelic psychedelic that's psychoactive". It is described as being quite psychoactive, but as lacking "hallucinations" and as not producing "mind-bending trips". The drug was assessed at five different doses by oral administration in a phase 1 clinical trial in 47 individuals. Its effects included heightened emotions, associative thinking, enhanced imagination, and perceptual effects such as brighter colors. However, there were no hallucinations, self-disintegration, oceanic boundlessness, or other typical features of psychedelic experiences. Its onset was 30 minutes and its peak of effects was 1.5 to 2 hours. Mindstate Design Labs has hypothesized that a mild psychedelic experience, as with 5-MeO-MiPT, could still provide therapeutic benefits without overt hallucinogenic effects.
In addition to its use on its own, 5-MeO-MiPT, along with the related tryptamine psychedelic 4-HO-MET, is employed as a component of the MDMA-mimicking Borax combo.

## Side effects

Adverse effects of 5-MeO-MiPT include loss of appetite and insomnia. Low-dose 5-MeO-MiPT did not cause any serious histopathological effects on the liver, kidney, and brain. High doses induce apoptotic cell death through caspase activity especially in some parts of the organs. There is no known documentation of death attributed to the use of 5-MeO-MiPT alone.

## Interactions

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

The mechanism that produces the hallucinogenic and entheogenic effects of 5-MeO-MiPT is thought to result primarily from serotonin 5-HT2A receptor agonism, although additional mechanisms of action such as inhibition of monoamine oxidase (MAO) might also be involved. In addition to the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor, 5-MeO-MiPT also potently binds to and/or activates other serotonin receptors, such as the serotonin 5-HT1A, 5-HT2B, and 5-HT2C receptors.
In addition to the serotonin receptors, 5-MeO-MiPT has also been found to show significant affinity to the serotonin transporter (SERT) and norepinephrine transporter (NET), thereby acting as a moderately potent serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI). However, subsequent research contradicted the preceding findings and found that 5-MeO-MiPT did not significantly bind to or inhibit the human monoamine transporters. The drug is also inactive as a monoamine releasing agent.
5-MeO-MiPT itself does not appear to have been studied, but the closely related drug 5-MeO-DiPT has been found to produce serotonergic neurotoxicity, genotoxicity, and associated cognitive deficits in rodents.

### Pharmacokinetics

#### Absorption and distribution

Following intraperitoneal administration of 5-MeO-MiPT at doses of 2.7 mg/kg in mice the compound was detectable in blood, kidney, liver, and brain. At lower doses of 0.27 mg/kg, concentrations of the parent compound remained below the limit of quantification in all samples.
In one human case report 5-MeO-MiPT concentrations were measured at 160 ng/mL in blood and 3,380 ng/mL in urine samples collected approximately one and two hours post-exposure, respectively.
In silico ADMET predictions projected high jejunal permeability and very high kidney permeability in MDCK cells, which suggests efficient gastrointestinal absorption and renal filtration. The compound demonstrated nearly complete blood-brain barrier penetration (99% predicted), and was not predicted to be a substrate for P-glycoprotein, or organic anion transporters. The predicted human percent unbound to blood plasma proteins was 45.5%, compared to 31.6% in mice. The predicted volume of distribution (Vd) for 5-MeO-MiPT was 3.743 L/kg, lower than its structural analogue 5-MeO-DiPT (4.219 L/kg) and DMT (4.396 L/kg).

#### Metabolism

5-MeO-MiPT undergoes extensive phase I hepatic metabolism, mediated by cytochrome P450 enzymes. In vitro experiments using pooled human liver microsomes identified seven phase I metabolites, of which five were found in vivo. The major metabolic pathways include O-demethylation, N-demethylation, hydroxylation, and N-oxide formation. The metabolic profile of 5-MeO-MiPT shows similarity to the structurally related compound 5-MeO-DiPT. 
In vivo analysis of forensic case sample identified five phase I metabolites in blood and seven in urine. The metabolites detected in both blood and urine included 5-MeO-NiPT, 5-HO-MiPT, 5-MeO-MiPT-N-oxide, and HO-5-MeO-MiPT. Two additional phase II metabolites (glucuronides) were found in mice and in vitro models, but not in human urine sample.
In silico ADMET predicted the compound to be a substrate but not an inhibitor for the CYP1A2 and CYP2C9 enzymes, and a substrate for CYP2A6 and CYP2B6. Additionally, the compound is predicted to be both substrate and inhibitor for the CYP2D6.
Detection of multiple metabolites in human urine sample two hours post-exposure, along with measurable blood concentrations at one hour, suggest relatively rapid metabolism and elimination. Renal excretion is likely a major route of elimination.

## Chemistry

### Synthesis

The chemical synthesis of 5-MeO-MiPT has been described.

### Analogues

Analogues of 5-MeO-MiPT include methylisopropyltryptamine (MiPT), 4-HO-MiPT (miprocin), 4-AcO-MiPT (mipracetin), 5-MeO-DMT, 5-MeO-DiPT, 5-MeO-DALT, 5-MeO-MET, 5-MeO-MPT, 5-MeO-EiPT, 5-MeO-PiPT, and 5-MeO-iPALT (ASR-3001), among others.

#### Positional isomers

6-MeO-MiPT and 7-MeO-MiPT are positional isomers of 5-MeO-MiPT. They have been described by Alexander Shulgin as being inactive at doses of up to 50 mg and 70 mg orally, respectively. Another notable positional isomer is 4-MeO-MiPT.

### Detection

5-MeO-MiPT causes the ehrlich reagent to turn purple then fade to faint blue. It causes the marquis reagent to go yellow through to black.

## History

5-MeO-MiPT was first described in the scientific literature by Alexander Shulgin and David Repke and colleagues in 1985. It was later described by Shulgin in greater detail in his 1997 book TiHKAL (Tryptamines I Have Known and Loved). The United States Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) proposed banning 5-MeO-MiPT in the 2020s, but this proposal was later withdrawn. The effort to make 5-MeO-MiPT a controlled substance was prominently opposed by the psychedelic community.

## Society and culture

### Legal status

The legal status of 5-MeO-MiPT differs internationally. It is not scheduled in Canada but is illegal if is sold for human consumption or recreational use , and in Luxembourg it is not listed among prohibited substances, making it not illegal but a legal gray area there. In the United States, it is unscheduled at the federal level, but may be treated as an analog of 5-MeO-DiPT under the Federal Analog Act therefore if is sold for human consumption and not for medical or scientific uses is illegal and persecuted. At the state level, "5-Methoxy-N-methyl-N-isopropyltryptamine" is classified as a Schedule I controlled substance in Florida, prohibiting its purchase, consumption, sale, or possession.
In other jurisdictions, control is stricter and could be punished by death or life imprisonment its sale for human use. As of September–October 2015, China lists 5-MeO-MiPT as a controlled substance. Finland includes it in its decree banning certain psychoactive substances from the consumer market. In the United Kingdom, it is classified as a Class A drug along with most ethers of ring-hydroxy tryptamines.

## Research

5-MeO-MiPT, under the developmental code name MSD-001, is being developed for the treatment of psychiatric disorders. It is under development specifically by Mindstate Design Labs. As of October 2025, the drug is in phase 1 clinical trials in the United States and European Union. A phase 1 trial was completed in July 2025. Mindstate Design Labs has developed an artificial intelligence (AI) platform known as Osmanthus to analyze trip reports in order to identify relationships between receptor interactions and psychoactive effects. Other research of this sort has also been conducted and published by other groups. Mindstate Design Labs's platform has processed 70,000 online trip reports and led to the selection of 5-MeO-MiPT for development. According to its developer, 5-MeO-MiPT is intended as a "neutral base compound" with mild effects on its own for use as a sort of "psychedelic tofu" in combination with other drugs to precisely modulate serotonin receptors and create various unique altered states of consciousness.
