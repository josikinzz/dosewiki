## Subjective Experience

This was another trip which was undertaken in South East Asia, where at the time
psilocybin mushrooms were legal and were openly on sale. It was also to be another
group experience, shared with fellow travellers.

I recall that the vendor offered us a dose to “take us to the moon”. How could we
refuse an offer like that? The mushrooms themselves came in inflated transparent
plastic bags, which he had stored in a fridge. He offered to serve them in milk shakes
but given a degree of paranoia regarding the police, we preferred the idea of eating
them raw in a hotel room.

They tasted, unsurprisingly, like raw mushrooms. They were edible but not exactly
tasty. Being greedy I ate my bag, and almost a half of someone else’s, who was rather
more circumspect. Perhaps I would get beyond the moon, possibly to mars.

The ride didn’t take too long to start; perhaps half an hour to an hour. As the
headspace emerged, the paintings on the walls became more noticeable, and the
colours more vibrant. Essentially, the traditional experience was emerging.

In actual fact, it didn’t go too far, so the dose was not as high as the vendor had
implied. Having stated this, there was the television incident.

We became immersed in, of all things, BBC World News. The stories were
fascinating, and I found myself providing non-stop commentary and narrative to my
non-British colleagues. I have no idea why, but it seemed to be appropriate.

We were also engrossed by the visuals. There was a sort of heavy drifting and double
vision going on, and it was constant. Remarkably, we all shared it.

I lost track of how long this continued for, but it must have been for close to an hour.
Then someone changed the channel. Wallop! It suddenly struck us. We had been
watching a 3D channel without the glasses, and hadn’t even realised. We had simply
assumed that the blurry edges were a manifestation of the psilocybin.

At this point we grasped that maybe we weren’t as far gone as we thought we were.
However, colours were still enhanced, and the headspace was still there. There was
overall warmth, empathy, and a great vibe.

This continued into the night, as we slowly came down. It had, in fact, been an
extremely enjoyable and memorable experience.

Such frivolity, however, grossly misrepresents a picture that includes the potential to
embark upon journeys of incredible discovery and self-
