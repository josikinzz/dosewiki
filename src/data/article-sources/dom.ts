*2,5-Dimethoxy-4-methylamphetamine* (*DOM*) or *STP* is a psychedelic drug of the substituted phenethylamine and substituted amphetamine chemical classes. It is a member of the DOx family of compounds. The phenethylamine equivalent (lacking the alpha-methyl group) is 2C-D.

This substance was first used recreationally in the mid-1960s and has little to no history of human usage prior to the 1991 publication of its synthesis and pharmacology in the *PiHKAL* (*Phenethylamines i Have Known And Loved*) by Alexander Shulgin. In modern times, it is used as a recreational drug and an entheogen, rarely sold on the streets and almost exclusively obtained as a grey area research chemical through the use of online vendors.

In terms of its pharmocology, DOM acts as a selective 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, and 5-HT2C receptor partial agonist. Its psychedelic effects are mediated via its actions on the 5-HT2A receptor. Due to its selectivity, DOM is often used in scientific research when studying the 5-HT2 receptor subfamily.

DOM is a highly dose sensitive psychedelic that is often sold on blotting paper and known for its strong visuals and intense body load. Many reports also indicate that the effects of this chemical may be overly intense for those who are not already experienced with psychedelics.

The DOC experience contains a complex and wide array of effects which based on the predefined potential subjective effects index found [here](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effects_index), I will now begin to breakdown and describe.

**Physical effects:**

The physical effects of DOM can be broken down into six components all of which progressively intensify proportional to dosage. These are described below and generally include:

- **Spontaneous tactile sensations** - The body high of DOM is manifested as somewhat intense in comparison to most classical psychedelics, however in comparison to DOC and the overwhelming forcefulness of 2C-E, it can actually be considered quite mild. The sensation itself can be described as a constantly present yet somewhat mild energetic pins and needles sensation that encompasses a person’s entire body. This is coupled with a euphoric, fast moving, sharp and location specific tingling sensation. It is usually felt over every square inch of the skin but occasionally manifests itself in the form of a continuously shifting tingling sensation that travels up and down the body in spontaneous waves.
- **Stimulation** - In terms of its effects on the physical energy levels of the tripper, DOM is usually considered to be extremely stimulating at levels which do not become overwhelming, resulting in a shakiness and unsteadiness of the hands but encouraging trippers to move around, run, dance, climb and generally engage in physical activities. In comparison, other more commonly used psychedelics such as psilocin are generally sedating and relaxed.
- **Increased bodily control**
- **Enhancement of touch** - Feelings of enhanced tactile sensation are consistently present at moderate levels throughout most DOM trips. Once Level 7A visuals are reached, an intense sensation of suddenly becoming aware of and being able to feel every single nerve ending across a person’s entire body all at once is consistently present.
- **Nausea** - Mild to extreme nausea are reported when consumed in moderate to high dosages and either passes once the tripper has vomited or gradually fades by itself as the peak sets in.
- **Vasoconstriction** - This effect is usually only present at higher dosages but can be particularly uncomfortable.

**Cognitive effects:**

The head space of DOM is described by many as one of extreme mental stimulation and a powerful enhancement of a person’s current mental state.

The total sum of these cognitive components regardless of the setting generally includes:

- **Introspection** - This component is consistently manifested only in the context of a non-social setting in which the user is alone.
- **Increased empathy, love and sociability** - This component is consistently manifested only in the context of social settings in which one is within the company of others. These feelings of sociability, love and empathy are a little weaker and less sharp than those found on substances such as MDMA and 2C-B but still prove strong enough to provide long lasting therapeutic effects.
- **Acceleration of thought**
- **Time distortion**
- **Feelings of fascination, importance and awe**
- **Conceptual thinking**
- **Connectivity of thought**
- **Enhancement of current mind state**
- **Removal of cultural filter**
- **Ego suppression, loss and death**

**Visual effects:**

*Enhancements*

DOM presents a full and complete array of possible visual enhancements which generally includes:

- **Increased visual acuity**
- **Enhancement of colours**
- **Enhanced pattern recognition**

*Distortions*

As for visual distortions and alterations, the effects experienced are detailed below:

- **Visual drifting** (*melting, flowing, breathing and morphing*) - In comparison to other psychedelics, this effect can be described as highly detailed, slow and smooth in motion, static in their appearance and unrealistic/cartoon like in style.
- **Tracers**
- **After images**
- **Texture repetition**
- **Colour shifting**
- **Scenery slicing**

*Geometry*

The visual geometry that is present throughout this trip can be described as more similar in appearance to that of 4-AcO-DMT or ayahuasca than that of LSD, 2C-B or 2C-I. They can be comprehensively described as structured in their organization, organic in geometric style, intricate in complexity, large in size, fast and smooth in motion, colourful in scheme, glossy in color, sharp in their edges and equally rounded and angular in their corners. They give off a contradictory natural and synthetic feel to them that at higher dosages are significantly more likely to result in states of Level 7B visual geometry over Level 7A.

*Hallucinatory states*

DOM and other substituted amphetamines produce a full range of high level hallucinatory states in a fashion that is more consistent and reproducible than that of many other commonly used psychedelics. This holds particularly true in comparison to other substances within the phenethylamine family. These effects include:

- **External hallucinations**
- **Internal hallucinations** - In comparison to other psychedelics such as LSD, DOM is extremely high in imagery embedded within visual geometry. This particular effect commonly contains hallucinations with scenarios, settings, concepts and autonomous entity contact. They are more common within dark environments and can be described as internal in their manifestation, lucid in believability, interactive in style and almost exclusively of religious, spiritual, mystical or a transcendental nature in their overall theme.

**Auditory effects:**

The auditory effects of DOM are common in their occurrence and exhibit a full range of effects which commonly includes:

- **Enhancements**
- **Distortions**
- **Hallucinations**

**Health effects, addiction potential and tolerance:**

The toxicity and long term health effects of recreational DOM have been studied in a very limited amount of scientific context and the exact toxic dosage is unknown. This is because DOM is a research chemical with very little history of human usage. Anecdotal evidence from people who have tried DOM within the psychedelic community suggests that there are no negative health effects attributed to simply trying this drug at low to moderate doses or using it very sparingly (but nothing can be completely guaranteed).

DOM is not physically addictive and many users experience a frequency self-regulating quality to the drug. Tolerance for DOM seems to be very mild and does not build up without repeated use over a short period of time.

**Legal issues:**

- **UK:** DOM is a Class A drug.
- **USA:** DOM is a Schedule I drug.
- **Canada:** DOM is a Schedule I drug.
- **New Zealand:** DOM is a Class C drug.
- **Belgium:** DOM is a Schedule I drug.

## Subjective Experience

DOM was first synthesized by Alexander Shulgin in 1963 and was later documented
in his book PiHKAL. It gained particular prominence during the summer of love
(1967), but a number of issues emerged, apparently due to the circulation of
particularly high-dosed pills, its slow onset and long duration. There were a number
of hospitalisations at the epicentre (San Francisco) causing some notoriety and
supply of the drug began to fade thereafter. Nonetheless, Shulgin listed this as one of
his magical half-dozen; his personal favourite compounds.

I finally obtained my supply some years after the publication of the first edition of
this book, but there was a hitch: the supplier was unsure whether the pills were
dosed at 3mg or 5mg. Given this dubious uncertainty I was particularly careful, and
of course sent some of my supply for full laboratory analysis.

On confirmation that this was indeed authentic DOM, I was left with one full pill
along with a crumbled half-pill, and something of a dilemma regarding dose. Despite
wanting to go reasonably high, I eventually decided to take a logical and cautious
path, and undertake two experiments: one with the crumbled half-pill and the other
at a later date with the full pill.

Regarding anticipated effects, this psychedelic is also a substituted amphetamine,
with a reputation for relative stimulation and an intense body high. Despite the
large-dose issues cited above, at the level I am limited to I don’t expect any
complications to arise.

\`\`\`
T+0.00 I pop the half-pill into my mouth, gently bite to crumble it, and
swallow with water [11.15am]
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+1.00 An hour in there is little to report other than some semblance of a
potentially emerging headspace.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+2.00 The headspace is now a little stronger. There is a hint of body load,
but with some stimulation and potential for horn. I feel a little chilly but
clammy at the same time.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+3.00 In truth I have felt tight-chested and uncomfortable for the last hour
or so. It’s hard to escape the notion that this is what the onset of a heart
attack might feel like.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
The upside is there but I am not able to properly enjoy this due to this issue.
There is a moderate headspace in play, with the stimulation and increased
sexual appetite becoming increasingly prominent.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+4.00 I lie in bed for a while and notice that my hands are trembling. The
tight chest remains. I would describe the headspace as mellow, but there are
no OEVs or CEVs to speak of, but rather, a bit of blurred and fuzzy vision.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
At this point I check my blood pressure and BPM. The former is 128/86, and
latter is a steady 56. These may seem reasonable but both figures are
significantly off my norm. I usually hover around 125/75 with a BPM of less
than 50 (which is generally considered to be quite low). The 86 (diastolic
blood pressure) is higher than I have ever seen it.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+5.00 With the chest discomfort being strong and persistent I take 0.5mg of
etizolam to (hopefully) calm it.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+6.00 It appears that the benzo has now started to take effect in that my
chest feels a little healthier. Blood pressure is back to normal although my
BPM remains elevated at 57. Not surprisingly I am now a little jaded and tired.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+8.00 The unpleasantness has largely subsided, leaving a hazy heady slightly
sleepy feel, and a general body awareness ebbing and flowing in the
\`\`\`

\`\`\`
background. The sexual payload has faded as well, and I note that this drug
could certainly be characterised as an effective chemsex agent.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+9.00 I take a short and gentle swim, and the stretching makes me feel a
little better. I am in the afterglow at this point, with just a mild headspace and
some body tactility.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
As bedtime approaches (9.30pm, over 10 hours in) I am somewhat exhausted,
in both body and mind, and am seriously looking forward to slumber. I feel
like I have been put through a ringer.
\`\`\`
On reaching the bedroom I took 1mg of etizolam, which as usual delivered a sound
night’s sleep. In the morning I felt a little distant but was generally well. On checking
my BPM and blood pressure at lunch time I was back within normal parameters.

*PiHKAL Entry #68*


## SYNTHESIS
A suspension of 9.5 g LAH in 750 mL well stirred anhydrous Et2O was held at reflux under an inert atmosphere, with the return of the condensed solvent passing through a Soxhlet thimble containing 9.5 g 1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylphenyl)-2-nitropropene. After the addition of the nitrostyrene was complete, the stirred suspension was maintained at reflux for an additional 4 h, then cooled to room temperature and allowed to continue stirring overnight. The excess hydride was destroyed by the addition of 750 mL 8% H2SO4, cautiously, until the hydrogen evolution ceased, then at a speed that allowed the formed solids to disperse. The phases were separated, the aqueous phase washed once with Et2O, treated with 225 g potassium sodium tartrate, and finally made basic (pH >9) with 5% NaOH. This was extracted with 3Ã150 mL CH2Cl2, the extracts pooled, and the solvent removed under vacuum. The residue was 9.6 g of a clear oil which spontaneously formed crystals with a mp of 60.5â61 Â°C from hexane. These solids were dissolved in 150 mL anhydrous Et2O, and saturated with anhydrous HCl gas. After standing at room temperature for 2 h, the crystalline 2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylamphetamine hydrochloride (DOM) was removed by filtration, washed with Et2O, and air dried to constant weight. There was obtained 8.25 g of glistening white crystals that had a mp of 190.5â191.5 Â°C. The sulfate had a mp of 131 Â°C. Anal. (C12H20ClNO2) C,H,N.

The above nitrostyrene may also be converted to the final amine product through the intermediary of the corresponding phenylacetone. To a well stirred suspension of 10.4 g powdered iron in 20 mL glacial acetic acid held at reflux temperature, there was added 4.9 g 1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylphenyl)-2-nitropropene as a solid. Refluxing was continued for 2 h and then all was filtered through wet Celite. After washing with 300 mL H2O followed by 300 mL Et2O, the combined filtrate and washes were separated, and the aqueous phase extracted with 2Ã100 mL Et2O. The organic phase and extracts were combined and washed with 2Ã100 mL saturated K2CO3 and the solvent was removed under vacuum yielding a reddish oil weighing 3.3 g. This was distilled at 111â115 Â°C at 0.5 mm/Hg to give a pale green solid. After recrystallization from benzene, there was obtained 2.8 g 1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylphenyl)-2-propanone as white crystals with a mp of 57â59 Â°C. This ketone has also been described as a pale-yellow oil with a bp of 115â118 Â°C at 0.4 mm/Hg. A solution of 0.7 g 1-(2,5-dimethoxyphenyl-4-methyl)-2-propanone in 20 mL MeOH was treated with 6.0 g ammonium acetate, 0.3 g sodium cyanoborohydride, and 3 g Linde 3 A molecular sieves. The mixture was stirred overnight, the solids removed by filtration, and the filtrate dissolved in 100 mL H2O. The solution was acidified with dilute H2SO4, and washed with 2Ã25 mL CH2Cl2. The aqueous phase was made basic with aqueous NaOH, and the product extracted with 2Ã25 mL CH2Cl2. The solvent was removed under vacuum, and the residue distilled (at 160 Â°C at 0.2 mm/Hg) to give colorless product which was dissolved in 3 mL IPA, neutralized with concentrated HCl, and diluted with 50 mL anhydrous Et2O. There was obtained 0.18 g of 2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylamphetamine hydrochloride (DOM) as a white solid with a mp of 187â188 Â°C.

The optical isomers of DOM have been prepared in two ways. The racemic base has been resolved as the ortho-nitrotartranilic acid salt by recrystallization from EtOH. The (+) acid provides the (+) or âSâ isomer of DOM preferentially. Also, the above-mentioned 1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylphenyl)-2-propanone can be reductively aminated with optically active alphÎ±-methyl benzylamine with Raney Nickel. This amine is isolated and purified by recrystallization of the hydrochloride salt. When optically pure, the benzyl group was removed by hydrogenolysis with palladium on carbon. The mp of either of the optical isomers, as the hydrochloride salts, was 204â205 Â°C.


## DOSAGE

## DURATION

## QUALITATIVE COMMENTS
(with 2.3 mg) âMood elevation at 2â3 hrs. After 3 hours, emotional effects become more pronounced, enhancement of color also. Very little distortion of perception, no disorientation, no creeping or flowing, but color enhancement considerable. The emotional content and empathy for others was closer to mescaline than to amphetamine, a welcome change. No suggestion of nausea at any time. Unable to sleep at ten hours, so I took 3/4 grain Seconal. Headache and listlessness next morning, probably due to the Seconal.â

(with 3 mg) âIn the middle of the experience I found that I was able to separate components of complex things so as to evaluate them separately. There is no need to respect their normal purpose. The sharpness of observation is enhanced, but one can focus at every different depth of a thing or a concept. Colors are not just brighter; there are more of them. There is a profoundness of meaning inherent in anything that moves. A line of thought or a bit of personal history ties the thinker to the objects that had been thought of, or once experienced. It is this relationship that will prove productive. Not like in a movie which is circular in its totalness, but as in true life where the future is the result of your own involvement with everything about you.â

(with 4 mg) âThe first four hours were largely directed to the body. There was a shuddering, and a tight jaw, and I am not particularly motivated to talk to anyone. It is more arousing (like amphetamine) than depressing (like phenobarb). I am feeling just a little sick at the three hour point, but a bit of regurgitation clears this up. Then at the fourth hour, it went totally outside of me. I saw the clouds towards the west. The clouds!!!  No visual experience has ever been like this. The meaning of color has just changed completely, there are pulsations, and pastels are extremely pastel. And now the oranges are coming into play. It is a beautiful experience. Of all past joys, LSD, mescaline, cannabis, peyote, this ranks number one. Normally I have no color effects with mescaline. A dynamic experience. Feels good, too.â

(with 5 mg) âThere was the magnification of light, color and odors. It was all very pleasant and beautiful, except that I had an overwhelmingly negative feeling. This at times grew to considerable intensity, and I feel it was clearly due to anger. At times the negativity disappeared completely, and I broke into the most enjoyable, even hilarious experiences. I alternated about 50â50 between joy and discomfort. As the evening drew on, I became withdrawn and pensive. It seemed clear that I had made all the wrong decisionsâchoice of partner, place to live, isolation, no meaningful activity. The greatest shocker was that my practice of meditation, which is one of my central focuses, and which I thought had brought me much peace and understanding, seemed to be a delusional solution to my unhappiness and isolation. The experience continued unabated throughout the night with much tension and discomfort. I was unable to get any sleep. I hallucinated quite freely during the night, but could stop them at will. While I never felt threatened, I felt I knew what it was like to look across the brink to insanity.â

(with 8 mg) âThe very quiet development picks up speed betweeen the first and second hour. There is a rich curly-imaged eyes-closed show that interlocks closely with music. It is occasionally an off-beat fantasy and not directly knit together, and even occasionally unenjoyable. But always intense and completely appropriate to the music. There is a continuous thirst, and little urine. Napping seems OK at 16 hours, but real sleep must wait until the 20 hour point. Overall a rolling +++, and I am looking forward to a repeat some day.â

(with 10 mg) âIf on this page I shall have expressed it to you then it is true that DOM has the glory and the doom sealed up in it. All thatâs needed to unseal it is to surround it with a warm living human for a few hours. For that human for those hours all the dark things are made clear.â

(with 12 mg) âThe first awareness was at 30 minutes and it was in the tummy. The development was extremely rapid, something more like LSD than previously remembered. The body tremor feels like poisoning, there is no escaping the feeling of being disabilitated, but at least there is no nausea. This transition ended and the trauma cleared completely at about the second hour. The music was exceptional, the erotic was exceptional, the fantasy was exceptional. Listzâs âA Christmas Cantata #1,â part 1, with eyes closed was an experience without precedent. There were some residual effects still noted the next day. This may be a bit much for me.â

(with 0.3 mg of the âRâ isomer) âMaybe slightly wiry? No effects.â

(with 0.5 mg of the âRâ isomer) âThere is a real effect, and it is significant that the first effects of the racemate were noted at 1.0 milligram. There is a trace of time slowing and in general a pretty full manic state. There is some mydriasis. Everything had pretty much cleared up by evening.â

(with 2.0 mg of the âSâ isomer) âNo effects. There was an unexpected slight tachycardia at the two hour point, but nothing suggesting psychotropic action.â

(with 2.6 mg of the âSâ isomer) âThere are signs of both pulse increase and blood pressure increase. There is some teeth-rubbiness, but still no psychological turn on at all.â


## EXTENSIONS AND COMMENTARY
The very modest amount of study of the individual optical isomers clearly indicates that the âRâ isomer is the more active. The sparse comments suggest that some of the heavier physical aspects of the racemate might be due to contributions from the âinactiveâ âSâ isomer. It is, after all, the âSâ isomer of amphetamine that carries the major punch of that stimulant. Maybe if that isomer were removed, and one were to explore the pure âRâ isomer of DOM, the dramatic visual aspects of the larger dosages might not be complicated with a troublesome physical component.

This compound, unbeknownst to me, was scattered widely and plentifully in the heyday of the Haight-Ashbury in San Francisco, in mid-1967. It was distributed under the name STP, which was said to stand for Serenity, Tranquility, and Peace. It was also claimed to represent Super Terrific Psychedelic, or Stop The Police. The police called it: Too Stupid to Puke. Actually, the name was taken from the initials of a motor additive which was completely unrelated chemically. Incredibly, and sadly, one of the avowed experts in the area of the âsensuous drugsâ actually stated that STP, the motor oil additive, was really one and the same as STP, the highly dangerous psychedelic. The motor oil additive, he wrote in a book of his, had properties somewhat related to those of LSD, mescaline, and the amphetamines. How fortunate that the love children of the time didnât do much reading, for they might have gotten into yet deeper pharmacological troubles with drug raids on the local gasoline stations.

Two complications became apparent during this first appearance and they led to serious difficulties. One, there was no equation made between STP and DOM. No one knew what this drug was which had been distributed in a cavalier way throughout the city. There could be no educated guess as to the best treatment of overdose emergencies. And secondly, the initial tablets that had been distributed apparently contained 20 milligrams of DOM per tablet; later, it was dropped to 10 milligrams. Either of these, in retrospect, is now known to be a thoroughly whopping dose. The overdose situation was aggravated by the slow onset of DOM. The user may be aware of some initial effects at the half-hour point, there will be what might be called a + or ++ at the end of the first hour, and the full impact of the drug is not appreciated until some two hours have elapsed. But many of the recipients of the free handouts of DOM were familiar with LSD which can show its alert in 15 to 20 minutes, or even sooner with a large dose, and there is already a deep and compelling intoxication felt at the half-hour point. They, quite reasonably, expected this familiar activity pattern with STP and assumed, when there was little if any activity noted at the half-hour point, that the potency was less than expected. They took one or even two additional dosage units. Thus, some of the overdose victims of that period may well have taken as much as 30 mg of DOM. The slow onset of action, coupled with the remarkably long duration, caught many innocent users unprepared.

Clinical studies have documented the rapid tolerance development from repeated exposures to DOM. Five volunteers were given 6 milligrams daily for three days. Objectively, psychological tests showed a decrease in responses. Subjectively, all found extremely intense effects on the first day, and all but one found it unpleasant. By the third exposure on the third day, all had diminished responses, ranging from only âmoderately strongâ to âfelt absolutely nothing.â One actually slept during the experience on the third day.

The hexadeutero-analogue (deuterium atoms on the two methoxyl groups) has been prepared as an internal standard for analytical work, but there are no reports of its human pharmacology. A study with this sort of derivative would be a fine companion to the studies already underway with the mescaline analogues that are similarly substituted. A difference exists, however. With mescaline, it is believed that the loss of a methoxyl group is a step towards the inactivation of the compound, whereas with DOM this loss may be associated with the formation of an active metabolite. The several fascinating questions raised by possible differences in both the rates and the degree of demethylation of these two compounds are well worth trying to answer.

A number of compounds related to DOM had been synthesized and studied at the University of California at San Francisco, at about this time. Two of these were simply the juggling of the two methoxyl groups and the methyl group on the ring, still maintaining the 2,4,5-ness relative to the amphetamine chain. These are 2,4-dimethoxy-5-methylamphetamine and 4,5-dimethoxy-2-methylamphetamine. Since the slang name for DOM in and about the medical center was STP, and since STP was the name of a motor oil additive, it is not unreasonable that the first of these to be synthesized, the 2,4-dimethoxy-5-methyl isomer, was referred to by the name of another motor oil additive popular at that time, F-310. The Vilsmeier reaction between 2,4-dimethoxytoluene and the Vilsmeier complex of POCl3 and N-methylformanilide gave the benzaldehyde (mp 117â118 Â°C) with a yellow malononitrile derivative from EtOH with a mp of 193â194 Â°C. The nitrostyrene from this and nitroethane formed yellow crystals from CH3CN, with a mp 138â139 Â°C. The amine formed easily with LAH in ether, and the product F-310 (or 5-DOM) gave white crystals from CH3CN with a mp of 182â183 Â°C.

And the other isomer, the 4,5-dimethoxy-2-methyl counterpart, became known familiarly as F-320, or sometimes simply 2-DOM. Its preparation followed an identical procedure, starting from 3,4-dimethoxytoluene. I have been told that F-310 is not active even at 20 milligrams in man, which would make it several times less potent than DOM (STP). I know of no trials with F-320. The use of the letter âFâ does not imply any relationship between these two compounds and the series described elsewhere with the âFâ code followed by other numbers, such as F-2 and F-22. These latter are Fâs because they are furans, not motor oil additives. And yet another oil additive, well known at the time as Z-7, became associated with the synthesis of the DOM (STP) isomer with its groups in the 2,4,6-positions. This is entered separately under Î¨-DOM.

**2,5-Dimethoxy-4-methylamphetamine** (also known as **DOM** and **STP** or **"Serenity, Tranquility and Peace"** ) is a lesser-known [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) substance of the [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Substituted_amphetamine) class. DOM is a member of the [DOx](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DOx) family of compounds which are known for their high potency, long duration, and mixture of [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) and [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) effects. It produces its effects by acting on [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) receptors in the brain.

DOM was first synthesized and tested in 1963 by [Alexander Shulgin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alexander_Shulgin) . It attained some popularity during the summer of 1967 under the name "STP" ("Serenity, Tranquility, and Peace"), but its use was short-lived due to its side effects. In 1991, the synthesis and pharmacology of DOM was published in Shulgin's book *[PiHKAL](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PiHKAL)* ("Phenethylamines I Have Known And Loved"). .

Over the years, DOM has gained a reputation for being a highly dose-sensitive psychedelic that is often sold on blotting paper and known for its strong visuals, body load and neutral, analytical headspace. Many reports also indicate that the effects of this chemical may be overly difficult to use for those who are not already experienced with psychedelics.

## History and culture

DOM was first synthesized and tested in 1963 by Alexander Shulgin, who was investigating the effect of 4-position substitutions on psychedelic amphetamines. DOM is part of the so-called "magical half-dozen" which refers to Shulgin's self-rated most important phenethylamine compounds, all of which except [mescaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mescaline) he developed and synthesized himself. They are found within the first book of [PiHKAL](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PiHKAL) and are as follows: [Mescaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mescaline) , DOM, [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) , [2C-E](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-E) , [2C-T-2](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-T-2) and [2C-T-7](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-T-7) .

In mid-1967, tablets containing 20 mg (later 10 mg) of DOM were widely distributed in the Haight-Ashbury District of San Francisco under the name of "STP" (short for "Serenity, Tranquility, and Peace"). [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] This short-lived appearance of DOM on the black market proved disastrous for several reasons. First, the tablets contained an excessively high dose of the chemical. This, combined with DOM’s slow onset of action (which encouraged some users, familiar with substances that have quicker onsets, such as LSD, to re-dose) and its remarkably long duration, caused many users to panic and sent some to the emergency room. Second, treatment of such overdoses was complicated by the fact that it was unknown at the time that the tablets called "STP" were DOM. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

## Chemistry

DOM, or 4-methyl-2,5-dimethoxyamphetamine, is a molecule of the [substituted amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Substituted_amphetamine) class. Amphetamines are substituted phenethylamines containing a phenyl ring bound to an amino (NH 2 ) group through an ethyl chain and a methyl group bound to the alpha carbon R α . DOM contains methoxy functional groups (OCH 3 ) attached to carbons R 2 and R 5 and a methyl group attached to carbon R 4 of the phenyl ring. DOM is the amphetamine analogue of the phenethylamine [2C-D](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-D) .

This is one of the last of the experimental compounds within the phenethylamine family on which any animal toxicity studies were performed prior to human studies. The LD50 of DOM is between 100 - 125 mg/kg for a mouse. An effective dose in a human of 2 mg (for an 80 kg man) is equivalent to 25 μg/kg.

As with DOI, the presence of a heavy atom, the bromine atom, in DOB makes the radioactive isotope labelled material a powerful research tool.

## Pharmacology

DOM is a selective [partial agonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist) at the [5-HT2 receptor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin#The_5-HT_System) family. Its psychedelic effects are mediated by its [agonistic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist) properties at the 5-HT 2A and 5-HT 2B receptors, but less so on the 5-HT 2C receptor. Due to its selectivity, DOM is often used in scientific research when studying the [5-HT2 receptor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin#The_5-HT_System) subfamily. DOM is a [chiral](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Chirality) molecule, and *R* -(-)-DOM is the more active [enantiomer](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Enantiomer) , functioning as a potent agonist of the serotonin family of receptors (mainly of the 5-HT 2 subtype). However, the role of these interactions and how they result in the psychedelic experience continues to remain elusive.

The 2,6-dimethoxy positional isomer of DOM, known as Ψ-DOM, is also mentioned in *PiHKAL* as being active, as is the alpha-ethyl homologue Ariadne. Analogues where the methoxy groups at the 2,5- positions of the aromatic ring have been altered have also been synthesised and tested as part of an effort to identify the binding mode of DOM at the 5-HT 2A receptor. Both the 2- and 5- O-desmethyl derivatives 2-DM-DOM and 5-DM-DOM, and the 2- and 5- ethyl analogues 2-Et-DOM and 5-Et-DOM have been tested, but in all cases were significantly less potent than the corresponding methoxy compound, showing the importance of the oxygen lone pairs in 5-HT 2A binding.

There is a strong implication that some metabolic conversion occurs in the lung, and it is only after this that the truly active metabolite is available for central action. This is consistent with the relatively slow onset of effect, and the very long duration of action.

## Subjective effects

User reports suggest that DOM is relatively clear-headed and absent of side-effects in comparison to [DOC](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DOC) or [DOB](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DOB) . ***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)** - In terms of its effects on the physical energy levels of the user, DOM is usually considered to be mildly stimulating at levels which do not become overwhelming, encouraging users to move around, run, dance, climb and generally engage in physical activities. In comparison, it is more stimulating than psychedelics like [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) , but less stimulating than most compounds of the [DOx](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DOx) family.
- **[Spontaneous bodily sensations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_bodily_sensations)** - The "body high" of DOM is reported to be somewhat intense in comparison to most classical [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) . However, in comparison to [DOC](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DOC) and the overwhelming forcefulness of [2C-E](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-E) , it can be considered relatively mild and natural in feel. The sensation itself can be described as a constantly present yet somewhat mild energetic pins and needles sensation that encompasses one's entire body. This is coupled with a euphoric, fast-moving, sharp and location specific tingling sensation. It is usually felt over every square inch of the skin, but occasionally manifests itself in the form of a continuously shifting tingling sensation that travels up and down the body in spontaneous waves.
- **[Tactile enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_enhancement)** - Feelings of enhanced tactile sensation are consistently present at moderate levels throughout most DOM experiences. If [Level 8A](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Level_8A) visuals are reached, an intense sensation of suddenly becoming aware of and being able to feel every single nerve ending across a person's entire body all at once is consistently present.
- **[Bodily control enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bodily_control_enhancement)**
- **[Bodily pressures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bodily_pressures)**

- **[Muscle cramps](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_cramps)**
- **[Nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea)** - Mild to extreme nausea is typically reported at moderate to high dosages and either passes once the user has vomited or gradually fades by itself as the peak sets in.
- **[Appetite suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Appetite_suppression)**
- **[Vasoconstriction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction)** - This effect is usually only present at higher dosages, but can be particularly uncomfortable and persistent.
- **[Dehydration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dehydration)**

- **[Teeth grinding](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Teeth_grinding)**
- **[Diarrhea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Diarrhea)** ### Visual effects
 
- Reports describe DOM as having less pronounced visuals proportional to it's accompanying physical and mental effects at low to moderate dosages. Higher ones do tend to display a unique set of visual effects which is not found with similar substances. 
#### Enhancements
 
- **[Acuity enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_acuity_enhancement)**
- **[Colour enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_enhancement)**
- **[Pattern recognition enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition_enhancement)**
 
#### Distortions
 
- **[Drifting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting)** *( [melting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Melting) , [flowing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Flowing) , [breathing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Breathing) and [morphing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#morphing) )* - In comparison to other psychedelics, this effect can be described as highly detailed, slow and smooth in motion, static in appearance and unrealistic/cartoon-like in style.

The visual geometry of DOM is described as being very unique and may share some similarity with [2C-D](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-D) . It can be comprehensively described through its [variations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Geometry#Variations) as intricate in style, equally algorithmic and abstract in form, equally synthetic and organic in style, structured in organization, brightly lit in lighting, multicolored in scheme, glossy in shading, sharp in edges, large in size, fast in speed, smooth in motion, equal in rounded and angular corners, non-immersive in-depth and consistent in intensity. Higher dosages are significantly more likely to result in states of [level 8A](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/8A_Geometry) visual geometry over [level 8B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/8B_Geometry) .
 
#### Hallucinatory states
 
DOM produces a full range of high-level hallucinatory states in a fashion that is more or less consistent and reproducible than that of many other commonly used [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) . These effects include:
 
- **[Transformations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Transformations)**
- **[Internal hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucination)** ( *[autonomous entities](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Autonomous_entities)* ; *[settings, sceneries, and landscapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Settings,_sceneries,_and_landscapes)* ; *[perspective hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perspective_hallucinations)* and *[scenarios and plots](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenarios_and_plots)* ) - In comparison to other psychedelics such as [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) , DOM is extremely high in its internal hallucinations when approaching higher dosages. This particular effect commonly contains hallucinations with scenarios, settings, concepts and autonomous entity contact. They can be comprehensively described in terms of their [variations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucinations#Variations) as lucid in believability, interactive in style, new experiences in content, autonomous in controllability and [geometry](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Geometry) -based in appearance. They are more common within dark environments and can be described as internal in their manifestation, lucid in believability, interactive in style and almost exclusively of a personal, religious, spiritual, science-fiction, fantasy, surreal, nonsensical or transcendental nature in their overall theme. ### Cognitive effects
 
- The cognitive effects of DOM are described by many as a combination of prominent mental stimulation and a powerful enhancement of a person's current mental state. 
- **[Analysis enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Analysis_enhancement)**
- **[Empathy, love, and sociability enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Empathy,_love,_and_sociability_enhancement)** - This component is consistently manifested only in the context of social settings in which one is within the company of others. These feelings of sociability, love and empathy are a little weaker and less sharp than those found on substances such as [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) and [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) , but still prove strong enough to provide long-lasting therapeutic effects.
- **[Conceptual thinking](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Conceptual_thinking)**
- **[Emotion enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Emotion_enhancement)**
- **[Immersion enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Immersion_enhancement)**
- **[Novelty enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Novelty_enhancement)**
- **[Increased music appreciation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_music_appreciation)**
- **[Memory suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Memory_suppression)** 
- **[Ego death](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ego_death)** - While DOM is technically able to produce states of ego dissolution, it tends to more often than not develop only in extremely high doses, with grave physical and mental side effects being apparent and is often of a terrifying nature.
- **[Personal bias suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Personal_bias_suppression)**
- **[Thought acceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_acceleration)**
- **[Thought connectivity](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_connectivity)**
- **[Time distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Time_distortion)**
- **[Wakefulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness)** ### Auditory effects
 
- - **[Auditory enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_enhancement)**
- **[Auditory distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_distortion)**
- **[Auditory hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_hallucination)** ### Multi-sensory effects
 
- - **[Synaesthesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Synaesthesia)** - In its fullest manifestation, this is a very rare and non-reproducible effect. Increasing the dosage can increase the likelihood of this occurring, but seems to only be a prominent part of the experience among those who are already predisposed to synaesthetic states. ### Transpersonal effects
 
- Transpersonal states on DOM are reported to occur less reliably and consistently than classical psychedelics. This can perhaps be attributed its the prominent physical and stimulating effects, which tends to interfere with the user's ability to fully immerse themselves in the experience. 
- **[Existential self-realization](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Existential_self-realization)**
- **[Unity and interconnectedness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Unity_and_interconnectedness)**
### Experience reports

Anecdotal reports which describe the effects of this compound within our [experience index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Experience_index) include:

Additional experience reports can be found here:

- [Erowid Experience Vaults: DOM](https://www.erowid.org/experiences/subs/exp_DOM.shtml)

## Toxicity and harm potential

The toxicity and long-term health effects of recreational DOM use do not seem to have been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dose is unknown.

Anecdotal evidence suggests that there are no negative health effects attributed to simply trying the substance by itself at low to moderate doses and using it very sparingly (but nothing can be completely guaranteed). [Independent research](https://www.google.com/) should always be done to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe before consumption.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this substance.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

DOM is not habit-forming and the desire to use it can decrease with use. It is most often self-regulating.

Tolerance to the effects of DOM is built almost immediately after ingestion. After that, it takes about 3 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 7 days to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). DOM presents cross-tolerance with all [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) , meaning that after the consumption of DOM all psychedelics will have a reduced effect.

### Overdose

The risk of a DOx overdose is present starting in or past the heavy dose range with sensitive people, or when a DOx is mixed with other substances, particularly [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) or [MAOIs](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MAOI) . Non-oral routes also seem to exhibit a higher chance of overdosing, perhaps owing to differences in bioavailability, potency and unpredictability of dosage and effects. The effects of a DOx overdose typically include bizarre, [delusional](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusion) and sometimes violent behavior, [amnesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amnesia) , [numbness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_suppression) , [confusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Confusion) and [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) . The user may not be able to communicate and can be severely agitated. At appropriately high doses, more serious side effects such as [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attack) and [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) which in turn further affect a dangerously [elevated heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate) , [blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure) and [vasoconstriction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction) may occur. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] Severe vasoconstriction typically develops to its peak several hours into the intoxication and may require medical assistance if blood flow is significantly cut off for extended periods of time.

In the event of an overdose, [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) or [antipsychotics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antipsychotics) can be administered to mitigate the hyperagitative effects. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] A powerful vasodilator may also need to be administered to prevent a hypertensive emergency, or in more serious cases, necrosis, organ failure and death from the resulting hypoxia. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] As a result, emergency medical services should always be sought in the event of a DOx overdose.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **Lithium** : Lithium is commonly prescribed in the treatment of bipolar disorder; however, there is a large body of anecdotal evidence that suggests taking it with psychedelics can significantly increase the risk of [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) and [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) . As a result, this combination should be **strictly avoided** .
- **[Tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol)** - Tramadol lowers the seizure threshold and [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) may act as triggers for seizures, particularly in those who are predisposed to them. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants)** - Stimulants affect many parts of the brain. Combined with psychedelics, stimulation can turn into uncontrollable [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [panic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) , [thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops) and [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) . This interaction may cause elevated risk of psychosis. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

## Effects
At the beginning, typical effects of amphetamine unfold, such as increased alertness, accelerated pulse, slight euphoria, increased self-confidence and urge to talk. Afterwards, the effect changes: one often feels a strong urge to move, sensory perception, feelings and empathy are heightened, colours are perceived more distinctly. With DOB and DOI, coloured, superimposed, pulsating patterns are perceived. This effect is weaker with DOM.

## Risks

### Short-term Risks
Since the effect of DOM comes on late, the danger of overdosing by refilling is particularly great. The long duration of action poses a psychological burden. Confusion or anxiety is common, especially at high doses. Some DOB users report a burning or pressure sensation in the bladder. At high doses, temporary paralysis, inability to communicate or insensitivity to pain (caution: risk of injury and accidents) may occur. Teeth grinding and strain on the cardiovascular system are also possible.

### Long-term Risks
Due to the long and intense effects, use - especially frequent use - carries the risk of a loss of reality, which can manifest itself in schizophrenic traits and anxiety states. The consumption of DOM can trigger latent (hidden) psychoses.

## Safer Use
- DOM are not suitable as party drugs and should only be used by experienced users.
- Plan your trip ahead because of the long duration of action.
- Never consume DOM alone and only when you feel very well mentally and physically and are well rested!
- Pay attention to set and setting: only take DOM in a place where you feel safe and avoid unwanted disturbances from outside! Prepare yourself well for the trip and prepare yourself internally for the long duration of the effect.
- Drink enough water during the trip.
- Mixed use of these potent substances should be avoided at all costs.
- As amphetamine derivatives, DOM can be particularly draining because of their long duration of action. Light vitamin-rich food, fruits, vegetable juices, vitamins and minerals promote a soft landing after the trip has subsided and can weaken a hangover.
- Plan enough time for recovery after the trip (at least 1 day)!
- A trip with DOM should remain an exceptional experience. Make sure to take long breaks from consumption so that the experience can be processed.

DOM is a psychedelic with strong stimulant qualities that has been used since the late 1960s. However, between the 1970s and 1990s, it was almost never used.

The drug, which is also known as STP, has a relatively intense body high that can manifest as a feeling of energy and tingling through the body. Because it’s a more stimulating psychedelic, it lends itself to physical activities.

It may take a long time to begin working, which means you should avoid redosing anywhere near your initial administration. It’d be wise to avoid considering an extra dose for at least 4-5 hours.

DOM hasn’t caused death even with doses over 20-30 mg, but that doesn’t mean those doses can be regarded as safe. While common doses do appear relatively safe for healthy people, you should minimize your use due to the lack of information.

*Source: https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/DOM*

**DOM** (2,5-Dimethoxy-4-methylamphetamine) is a psychdelic substituted amphetamine with effects similar to LSD. It has a slow come up, and an extremely long duration.

## History

DOM first saw human use in 1967, when tablets sold under the street name 'STP' started to become popular in the Haight-Ashbury District of San Francisco. These tabs contained an excessively high dose in the range of 15 to 20mg. This, combined with the long onset of the drug, led to numerous non-fatal overdoses.

## Dosage

| Threshold | 0.5-1mg |
| --- | --- |
| Light | 1-2.5mg |
| Common | 2.5-5mg |
| Strong | 5-7.5mg |
| Heavy | 7.5mg+ |
| LD50 | 18mg/KG |

## Duration

Note: This is a very dose dependent substance, with higher doses yielding longer, more intense results.

| First effects | 1-2 hours |
| --- | --- |
| Coming up | 1-2 hours |
| Peak | 2-3 hours |
| Plateau | 4-6 hours |
| Coming down | 4-12 hours |
| After-effects | 4-16 hours |

## Harm Reduction

### Warning

**DOM** has been known to have a long comeup (up to 3 hours in some cases), as well as being one of the longer-acting psychedelic phenethylamines. For this reason, redosing is not recommended.

2,5-Dimethoxy-4-methylamphetamine (DOM), also known as STP (standing for "Serenity, Tranquility, and Peace" and other phrases), is a psychedelic drug of the phenethylamine, amphetamine, and DOx families. It has stimulant and antidepressant-like effects at low doses and hallucinogenic effects at higher doses. The drug can have a very slow onset and long duration, with its duration possibly being up to a few days at high doses. It is usually taken orally.
Side effects of DOM include amphetamine-like effects, among others. The drug acts as a serotonin 5-HT2 receptor agonist, including of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor. Analogues of DOM include mescaline, 2C-D, DOET, DOB, DOI, and Ariadne (4C-D), among others.
DOM was first synthesized and tested by Alexander Shulgin in 1963 and was later further described in his 1991 book PiHKAL (Phenethylamines I Have Known and Loved). The drug caused a small public health crisis in San Francisco in 1967 when it was introduced as a substitute for LSD, which was due to the tablets containing high doses and causing intense and very long-lived effects. DOM is classified as a Schedule I controlled substance in the United States, and is similarly controlled in other parts of the world. Internationally, it is a Schedule I drug under the Convention on Psychotropic Substances.

## Use and effects

In his book PiHKAL (Phenethylamines I Have Known and Loved) and other publications, Alexander Shulgin lists DOM's dose as 3 to 10 mg orally and its duration as 14 to 24 hours. An estimated typical dose is about 6 mg. The (R)-enantiomer, (R)-DOM, was active at a dose of 0.5 mg, whereas DOM itself produces threshold effects only at 1 mg. The (S)-enantiomer, (S)-DOM, showed no psychoactive effects at doses of up to 2.6 mg. As such, the activity of DOM appears to reside in (R)-DOM, with this enantiomer appearing to be roughly twice as potent as racemic DOM. In a review by Richard Glennon and colleagues, the approximate hallucinogenic dose was listed as 2 to 5 mg for racemic DOM, 1.0 to 2.5 mg for (R)-DOM, and greater than 4 mg for (S)-DOM, with no known active level of the latter enantiomer. DOM is said by Shulgin to have a slow build-up, with an onset of 30 to 60 minutes and a peak of 2 to 6 hours. It may also have a very long duration of up to 3 or 4 days when taken in excessively high doses such as 14 to 30 mg. However, it is unclear the extent to which this is actually true or may just be exaggeration. DOM is about 50- to 150-fold as potent as mescaline and around 30- to 60-fold less potent than LSD.
The effects of DOM were reported by Shulgin to include feeling strange, color enhancement, closed-eye imagery, visuals, introspection and insights, fantasy, depersonalization, music and erotic enhancement, time dilation, emotional changes, mood elevation, increased empathy, stimulation, mood swings, tension, discomfort, feeling overwhlemed or like one is losing control, impairment, pupil dilation, jaw tightness, muscle tremors, feeling sick, no nausea, other burdensome physical side effects, insomnia, and sleep disturbances. It has also been observed that DOM produces similar effects to LSD but causes less disorientation, impairment, and ego dissolution. The effects of DOM are highly dependent on set and setting, as with psychedelics in general. At lower doses of 2 to 5 mg, DOM is said to produce few or no physiological effects, no perceptual distortion, and more subtle visual, cognitive, and affective changes, but as not producing hallucinogenic effects at such doses. The drug was one of Shulgin's "magical half-dozen" psychedelic compounds in PiHKAL.
The effects of DOM were formally assessed in clinical studies by Solomon H. Snyder and Leo Hollister and colleagues in the late 1960s and early 1970s. At low doses, such as 1 to 4 mg, DOM produced effects including stimulation, euphoria, enhanced self-awareness, and mild dose-dependent perceptual disturbances. At higher doses, of above 5 to 7 mg, DOM produces marked and full psychedelic effects. Hallucinogenic effects were said to start at doses of more than 3 to 5 mg. Other effects of the drug were also described. Although Shulgin described the effects of DOM as typically lasting 14 to 20 hours, clinical studies with low doses reported a duration of only 5 to 8 hours, but with a lack of an unexpectedly long duration even at doses of up to 14 mg. Another source listed the average duration as only 8 to 15 hours at doses of 5 or 10 mg. The reasons for these discrepancies are unclear. The onset was 0.5 to 1.5 hours and peak effects occurred after 3 to 5 hours.
Low doses of DOM have been used as a stimulant, such as by the Grateful Dead. This may be the first known instance of psychedelic microdosing. The related drug DOET is also implicated as having stimulant and "psychic energizer" effects at low doses, which notably greatly impressed Shulgin.

## Interactions

The typical antipsychotic and serotonin 5-HT2A receptor antagonist chlorpromazine has been reported to partially reduce the effects of DOM.

## Side effects

Side effects of DOM include sweating, muscle tremors, and large increases in heart rate. These are said to be worrisome and not seen with other psychedelics like LSD. (S)-DOM produces increased heart rate and blood pressure but no psychoactive effects, in contrast to (R)-DOM. It may be importantly involved in the physical side effects of DOM, such that enantiopure (R)-DOM might be better-tolerated.

### Tolerance

Repeated administration of DOM results in rapid tolerance development. In one study, in which five people were given 6 mg DOM for 3 days, there were "extremely intense" effects the first day, but diminished effects on the third day, ranging from "moderately strong" to "felt absolutely nothing". In another study, in which two people were given gradually increasing doses from 1 to 12 mg over 8 days, there was development of marked partial tolerance to the effects of DOM. Tolerance developed to both the psychoactive and physiological effects of the drug.

## Overdose

Overdose of DOM can have a very long duration and result in an amphetamine psychosis-like state. It is said to have pronounced hallucinogenic effects as well as amphetamine-like side effects in overdose.

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

#### Actions

DOM acts as a selective serotonin 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, and 5-HT2C receptor full agonist. Its psychedelic effects are thought to be mediated by its agonistic properties at the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor. Due to its selectivity, DOM is often used in scientific research in studies of the 5-HT2 receptor subfamily. DOM is a chiral molecule, and R-(−)-DOM is the more active enantiomer, functioning as a potent agonist of these receptors.
The drug is inactive as a human trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1) agonist but is an agonist of the rhesus monkey TAAR1. DOM is inactive as a monoamine reuptake inhibitor and releasing agent. It is a very weak monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI), specifically of monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A), whereas it was inactive at monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B).

#### Effects

DOM produces the head-twitch response in rodents, a behavioral proxy of psychedelic-like effects. The head-twitch response produced by DOM is robust. It also substitutes for LSD in rodent drug discrimination tests. DOM is widely used as a psychedelic training drug in rodent drug discrimination assays and many other serotonergic psychedelics have been shown to generalize to it. Other effects of DOM in rodents include hyperlocomotion at lower doses, hypolocomotion at higher doses, and hypothermia at high doses.
In contrast to amphetamines like (−)-cathinone but similarly to mescaline, DOM has shown no stimulant-like or reinforcing effects in rhesus monkeys. Conversely however, DOC has shown reinforcing effects, including conditioned place preference (CPP) and self-administration, in rodents similarly to methamphetamine. This is analogous to other findings in which various 2C and NBOMe drugs have been found to produce dopaminergic elevations and reinforcing effects in rodents.
DOM has potent anti-inflammatory effects, which may have medical applications.

### Pharmacokinetics

The pharmacokinetics of DOM, including in humans, have been very limitedly studied. The drug crosses the blood–brain barrier in rodents. Metabolites of DOM like 2-O-desmethyl-DOM (2-DM-DOM) and 5-O-desmethyl-DOM (5-DM-DOM) are pharmacologically active and show psychedelic-like effects in animal studies. They might contribute to the delayed onset and long duration of DOM in humans. However, these metabolites might also produce metabolism-dependent neurotoxicity. About 5 to 20% of a dose of DOM is excreted unchanged in humans.

## Chemistry

DOM, also known as 2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylamphetamine or as 2,5-dimethoxy-4-methyl-α-methylphenethylamine, is a substituted phenethylamine and amphetamine and is a member of the DOx group of drugs. It is structurally related to the naturally occurring phenethylamine psychedelic mescaline (3,4,5-trimethoxyphenethylamine).

### Properties

The chemical properties of DOM have been described.

### Synthesis

The chemical synthesis of DOM has been described.

### Analogues

Analogues of DOM include other DOx drugs such as DOET, DOB, DOI, DOC, and TMA, among others. The α-desmethyl or phenethylamine analogue of DOM is 2C-D. Ariadne is the α-ethyl or phenylisobutylamine homologue of DOM.
The 2,6-dimethoxy positional isomer of DOM, known as Ψ-DOM, is also mentioned in PiHKAL as being active, as is the α-ethyl homologue Ariadne. Analogues where the methoxy groups at the 2,5- positions of the aromatic ring have been altered have also been synthesised and tested as part of an effort to identify the binding mode of DOM at the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor. Both the 2- and 5- O-desmethyl derivatives 2-DM-DOM and 5-DM-DOM, and the 2- and 5- ethyl analogues 2-Et-DOM and 5-Et-DOM, have been tested, but in all cases were significantly less potent than the corresponding methoxy compound, showing the importance of the oxygen lone pairs in 5-HT2A binding.

## History

DOM was first synthesized and tested in 1963 by Alexander Shulgin, who was investigating the effect of 4-position substitutions on psychedelic amphetamines. His 15-year-old son Theodore "Ted" Shulgin assisted in the synthesis of DOM by performing the first step of the synthesis at Dow Chemical Company on June 22, 1963 during a brief period when he was interested in chemistry. Later, Alexander Shulgin completed the synthesis on November 30, 1963. He initially discovered the effects of DOM on January 4, 1964, when he ingested a 1 mg dose orally. The hallucinogenic effects of DOM were discovered on February 3, 1964 by Shulgin's colleague Thornton W. Sargent when he ingested 2.3 mg. The first clearly psychedelic experience occurred with a dose of 4.1 mg on November 6, 1964. Shulgin hoped that Dow Chemical Company would develop DOM for medical purposes.
In mid-1967, tablets containing 20 mg and later 10 mg of DOM were widely distributed in the Haight-Ashbury District of San Francisco under the name of STP, having been manufactured by underground chemists Owsley Stanley and Tim Scully. This short-lived appearance of DOM on the black market proved disastrous for several reasons. First, the tablets contained an excessively high dose of the chemical. This, combined with DOM's slow onset (which encouraged some users, familiar with drugs that have quicker onsets, such as LSD, to re-dose) and its remarkably long duration, caused many users to panic and sent some to the emergency room. Second, treatment of such overdoses was complicated by the fact that no one at the time knew that the tablets called STP were, in fact, DOM, and there was no effective antidote.

## Society and culture

### Names

The name DOM is an acronym of the code name "des-oxy-methyl" coined by the drug's inventor Alexander Shulgin. The drug was also initially known by the code name K-61,082 and is widely known by its nickname STP. The STP name has been said to stand for various acronyms, including Serenity, Tranquility, and Peace, Super Terrific Psychedelic, Stop The Police, and Too Stupid to Puke, among others.

## Research

DOM, along with DOET, was of interest in the potential treatment of psychiatric disorders such as depression in the 1960s. Subsequently, the related compound Ariadne (4C-D; BL-3912; Dimoxamine) was investigated in the 1970s, but was not marketed either.
