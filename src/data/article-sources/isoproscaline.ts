## SYNTHESIS
A solution of AH was prepared by the cautious addition of 0.84 mL of 100% H2SO4 to 32 mL of 1.0 M LAH in THF, which was being vigorously stirred under He at ice-bath temperature. A solution of 5.93 g of 3,5-dimethoxy-4-isopropoxyphenylacetonitrile in 10 mL anhydrous THF was added dropwise. Stirring was continued for 30 min, then the reaction mixture was brought up to reflux on the steam bath for another 30 min. After cooling again to room temperature, 5 mL IPA was added to destroy the excess hydride, followed by about 10 mL of 15% NaOH, sufficient to make the aluminum salts loose, white, and filterable. The reaction mixture was filtered, the filter cake washed with IPA, the mother liquor and washes combined, and the solvent removed under vacuum. The residue (7.0 g of an amber oil) was dissolved in dilute H2SO4 and washed with 3Ã75 mL CH2Cl2. The aqueous phase was made basic with aqueous NaOH, and the product extracted with 3Ã75 mL CH2Cl2. The extracts were evaporated to a residue under vacuum, and this was distilled at 125â140 Â°C at 0.3 mm/Hg yielding 3.7 g of a colorless oil. This was dissolved in 15 mL IPA, neutralized with 50 drops of concentrated HCl which allowed the deposition of a white crystalline product. Dilution with anhydrous Et2O and filtration gave 3.7 g. of 3,5-dimethoxy-4-isopropoxyphenethylamine hydrochloride (IP) with a mp of 163â164 Â°C. Anal. (C13H22ClNO3) C,H,N. The catalytic hydrogenation process for reducing the nitrile that gives rise to escaline, also works with this material.


## DOSAGE

## DURATION

## QUALITATIVE COMMENTS
(with 80 mg) âIt took about two hours for the body to settle down. Emotions were true and well felt, a fact that is an all-important thing to me as it probably is to everyone else I know in this kind of exploration. Any sense that there is a dulling of the feeling and emotional area of the self is a negative, to be watched and noted as are other things such as disturbed sleep, unpleasant dreams, or irritability or depression the next day. I was interacting with others with a great deal of intensity. People found themselves wandering inside and out, listening to music, stirring soup, eating a bit and enjoying eating, talking, laughing a great deal, and being silent in great contentment. Itâs not a very silent material, though. Talking is too enjoyable. There was a slight descent noted at 6â7 hours, but very gentle and smooth. Slow and pleasant descent until about 12th hour, when sleep was attempted. Next day, everyone slightly irritable but good mood anyway. The next night I slept deeply and well, and awoke whole and in excellent mood.â


## EXTENSIONS AND COMMENTARY
A momentâs aside for a couple of the words that are so much a part of the chemistâs jargon. Room temperature, as used above, means the natural temperature that something comes to if it is put on the table and is neither heated nor cooled. The phrase, I discovered during my year at Gif, is completely un-understandable in French. A room has no temperature. Only things in rooms have temperatures. Their expression is more exact. The object achieves, in the French terminology, a temperature normale dâinterieur, or about 15 to 16 Â°C. But in common laboratory parlance it has become the temperature dâambiance.

And one finds the prefix âisoâ used everywhere. Considerable care should be taken in the two different uses of the prefix âisoâ in the nomenclature with the mescaline analogues. In general, the term âisoâ means the other one of two possibilities. If you are allowed to paint a house only with green paint or red paint, and green is the color you actually use, then red could be called iso-green. With isoproscaline (here) there is a rearranging of the propyl group on the 4-oxygen of mescaline. It has been replaced with its branched analogue, the other of two possibilities, the isopropyl group. Everything is still with the 3,4,5-orientation on the benzene ring. However, with IM (isomescaline) there is a rearrangement of substitution pattern on the benzene ring, with the repositioning of the trimethoxyl substitution pattern from the 3,4,5- arrangement to the 2,3,4- arrangement. It has been the side-chain that has taken the other of two possible positions. The term âisoâ must always be interpreted in precise context.

Isoproscaline or 4-isopropoxy-3,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine is an analogue of mescaline. It is closely related to proscaline and was first synthesized by David E. Nichols and colleagues. It produces psychedelic effects.

## Use and effects

Little is known about the psychopharmacological effects of isoproscaline. In his book PiHKAL, Alexander Shulgin lists a psychedelic dose as being 40–80 mg, with effects lasting 10–16 hours.

## Interactions

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

The mechanism that produces the hallucinogenic and entheogenic effects of isoproscaline is most likely to result from action as a 5-HT2A serotonin receptor agonist in the brain, a mechanism of action shared by all of the hallucinogenic tryptamines and phenethylamines.

## Chemistry

Isoproscaline is in a class of compounds commonly known as phenethylamines, and the full chemical name is 2-(4-isopropoxy-3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)ethanamine.

### Synthesis

The chemical synthesis of isoproscaline has been described.

### Analogues

Analogues of isoproscaline include mescaline, escaline, proscaline, allylescaline, and methallylescaline, among others.

## Society and culture

### Legal status

Isoproscaline is unscheduled in the United States; however, because of its close similarity in structure and effects to mescaline, possession and sale of isoproscaline may be subject to prosecution under the Federal Analog Act.
In the UK, its highly likely that this compound would be covered by the "phenylethylamine amendment" to the misuse of drugs act likely rendering it a Class A controlled drug.
