5-MeO-MET, also known as 5-methoxy-N-methyl-N-ethyltryptamine, is a serotonin receptor modulator, putative serotonergic psychedelic, and relatively rare designer drug of the tryptamine family related to psychedelic drugs like methylethyltryptamine (MET) and 5-MeO-DMT.

## Use and effects

5-MeO-MET was not included nor mentioned in Alexander Shulgin's book TiHKAL (Tryptamines I Have Known and Loved). Relatedly, its properties, such as dose and duration, and its effects were not described.

## Interactions

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

Early studies found 5-MeO-MET to be more potent in animal behavioral tests than 5-MeO-DMT. Subsequent studies confirmed that 5-MeO-MET interacts with serotonin receptors similarly to other psychedelic tryptamines. A more modern study found that 5-MeO-MET is a potent serotonin 5-HT1A receptor ligand and serotonin 5-HT2A receptor agonist and produces the head-twitch response, a behavioral proxy of psychedelics, in rodents. Its activities were of similar potency as 5-MeO-DMT.

## Chemistry

### Analogues

Analogues of 5-MeO-MET include methylethyltryptamine (MET), 4-HO-MET (metocin), 4-AcO-MET (metacetin), bretisilocin (5-fluoro-MET), 7F-5-MeO-MET, 5-MeO-DMT, 5-MeO-DET, 5-MeO-MPT, 5-MeO-EPT, 5-MeO-MALT, and 5-MeO-MiPT, among others.

## History

5-MeO-MET was first synthesized and limitedly studied in the 1960s. The drug was first identified on the illicit market in June 2012 in Sweden. It was made illegal in Norway in 2013.
