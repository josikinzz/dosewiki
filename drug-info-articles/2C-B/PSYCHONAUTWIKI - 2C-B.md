**4-Bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine** (also known as **Nexus** , **Bromo Mescaline** , **BDMPEA** , **Venus** , and **2C-B** ) is a novel [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) substance of the [phenethylamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamine) class. It is perhaps the most well-known member of the [2C-x family](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-x_family) , which are structurally related to the classical psychedelic [mescaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mescaline) . The mechanism of action is not fully known, although [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) [receptor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Receptor) binding activity is thought to be principally involved.

2C-B was discovered in 1974 by the American chemist [Alexander Shulgin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alexander_Shulgin) , who was investigating psychedelic phenethylamines derived from [mescaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mescaline) . In the 1970s, it first saw use as a therapeutic aid by a small circle of American psychotherapists and was considered one of the best substances for this purpose due to its short duration, relative absence of side effects, and comparably mild nature.

Recreational use was observed shortly afterward and it was briefly manufactured and sold commercially under such names as "Erox" and "Nexus" in "head" / "smart" shops and adult video stores before being federally scheduled in 1995.

[Subjective effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effects) include [open and closed-eye visuals](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Geometry) , [time distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Time_distortion) , [euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Euphoria) , and [ego loss](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ego_loss) . User reports have described the effects of 2C-B as moderate, warm, colorful, and highly sensual. Similar to [mescaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mescaline) , it is described as possessing a less serious or grandiose headspace than [tryptamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tryptamines) like [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) or [psilocybin mushrooms](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocybin_mushrooms) , placing greater emphasis on the visual and tactile domain.

Smaller doses (under 15 mg) are reported to be useful as a sensory and aesthetic enhancer (in a manner somewhat similar to [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) ) while larger doses are reported to produce a distinct mind-manifesting psychedelic effect.

While more research is needed, it is generally thought to be physiologically well-tolerated [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] . It likely has a [safety profile similar to classical psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics#Toxicity_and_harm_potential) , which are known to have low abuse potential and toxicity. However, adverse psychological reactions such as severe [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) , [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) are always possible, particularly for those predisposed to mental disorders.

It is highly advised to use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Harm_reduction_practices) if using this substance.

## History and culture

2C-B was first synthesized and tested for psychoactivity in 1974 by the American chemist and psychedelic researcher [Alexander Shulgin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alexander_Shulgin) , who was investigating novel psychedelic compounds based on the chemical structure of [mescaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mescaline) .

Shulgin's findings were later published in the 1991 book [PiHKAL](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PiHKAL) , in which he listed 2C-B among the "magical half-dozen" of [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) [phenethylamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamines) that he deemed most important. The list consists of [mescaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mescaline) , [DOM](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DOM) , 2C-B, [2C-E](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-E) , [2C-T-2](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-T-2) , and [2C-T-7](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-T-7) . In interviews, Shulgin repeatedly declared it his favorite psychedelic trip.

In the 1970s, it was used in patients by a small number of psychotherapists in the United States. These therapists reported that it created a warm, empathetic bond between them and their patients, helping to break down their ego defenses and inner resistances and allowing the patient to get in touch with suppressed emotions and repressed memories. The gentle nature of 2C-B, in addition to its mild side effects and short duration, were found to be desirable traits for a therapeutic setting.

Shortly after gaining traction in the underground psychotherapy community, 2C-B became popular in the recreational drug scene. It was well-liked as a [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) substitute in raves and club parties due to its minimal comedown and a clear, euphoric headspace.

In the 1980s and early 1990s, several foreign companies legally manufactured the substance under the brand names "Nexus", "Erox", and "Performax" and advertised that it would alleviate impotence, frigidity, and diminished libido. It was sold at adult book and video stores, "head" shops, and some nightclubs. The DEA reported its distribution in Miami, Florida in the form of yellow pills marketed as an aphrodisiac.

In the United States, it gained popularity as an alternative to MDMA after the latter was classified as a Schedule I substance in 1985. The increasing popularity of 2C-B led to it also being placed in Schedule I in 1995. It saw a resurgence in interest in the 2000s, with the advent of the ["research chemicals"](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemicals) /"designer drugs" scene and darknet markets.

2C-B was legally sold in Southern Africa from 1993 to early 1996. It was marketed as medicine for Sangomas (traditional healers) under the name "Ubulawu Nomathotholo", which roughly translates to "Medicine of the Singing Ancestors".

## Chemistry

2C-B, or 2,5-dimethoxy-4-bromophenethylamine, is a [substituted phenethylamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Substituted_phenethylamine) . Substituted phenethylamines are a chemical class of organic compounds that are based upon the phenethylamine structure, a phenyl ring bound to an amino (NH 2 ) group through an ethyl chain. 2C-B possesses methoxy functional groups CH 3 O- attached to carbons R 2 and R 5 as well as a bromine atom attached to carbon R 4 of the phenyl ring.

2C-B belongs to the [2C family](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-x) of phenethylamines, all of which possess methoxy groups on the 2 and 5 positions of the benzene ring.

## Pharmacology

Unlike most [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) , 2C-B has been shown to be a low efficacy [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) 5-HT 2A receptor [partial agonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist#Agonists) or even full [antagonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antagonist) . This suggests that the 5-HT 2C receptor is primarily responsible for mediating the effects experienced by users of 2C-B. Research also suggests that 2C-B increases [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) levels in the brains of rats which may contribute to its psychoactivity.

However, the role of these interactions and how they result in the [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) experience continues to remain elusive.

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)** - 2C-B is typically described as very energetic and stimulating in a fashion that draws comparisons to [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) . At higher doses this effect can become more forced, encouraging users to engage in physical activities such as dancing.
- **[Spontaneous bodily sensations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_bodily_sensations)** - The "body high" of 2C-B is reported to be one of the most complex among [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) , exhibiting aspects of [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) , [2C-E](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-E) , and [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) . This is first characterized by an intense soft, warm glow that grows over the body and is capable of becoming highly [euphoric](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria) .
- **[Nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea)** - Mild to extreme nausea is reported when consumed in moderate to high dosages and either passes once the user has vomited or gradually fades by itself as the peak sets in.
- **[Appetite suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Appetite_suppression)** - While not as intense as stimulants such as [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) , most doses can cause a decrease in appetite.
- **[Bodily control enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bodily_control_enhancement)**
- **[Increased blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure)**
- **[Increased bodily temperature](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_bodily_temperature)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Increased heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate)**
- **[Increased perspiration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_perspiration)**
- **[Dehydration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dehydration)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Pupil dilation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pupil_dilation)**
- **[Tactile enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_enhancement)**
- **[Teeth grinding](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Teeth_grinding)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] - This component can be considered to be less intense when compared with that of [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) . ### Visual effects
 
- #### Enhancements
 
- **[Colour enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_enhancement)**
- **[Magnification](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Magnification)**
- **[Pattern recognition enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition_enhancement)**
- **[Visual acuity enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_acuity_enhancement)**
 
#### Distortions
 
- **[Drifting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting)** *( [melting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Melting) , [flowing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Flowing) , [breathing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Breathing) and [morphing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#morphing) )* - In comparison to other psychedelics, this effect can be described as highly detailed, slow and smooth in motion, static in appearance and cartoon-like in style.
- **[After images](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/After_images)**
- **[Colour shifting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_shifting)**
- **[Depth perception distortions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depth_perception_distortions)**
- **[Recursion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Recursion)**
- **[Scenery slicing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenery_slicing)**
- **[Symmetrical texture repetition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Symmetrical_texture_repetition)**
- **[Tracers](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tracers)**
 
#### Geometry
 
The visual geometry of 2C-B is reported to be more similar in appearance to that of [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) than that of [2C-E](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-E) , [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) , or [ayahuasca](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ayahuasca) . It can be comprehensively described as unstructured in organization, algorithmic in geometric style, intricate in complexity, large, fast and smooth in motion, colorful in scheme, glossy in color, sharp in its edges and angular in its corners. It seems high in algorithmic visuals such as fractals and at higher dosages are significantly more likely to result in states of [level 8A](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/8A_Geometry) visual geometry over [level 8B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/8B_Geometry) .
 
#### Hallucinatory states
 
Like [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) , while 2C-B is capable of producing a full range of low and high-level hallucinatory states, they are comparatively rare and inconsistent at higher levels while common at lower levels. They generally include the following effects:
 
- **[Transformations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Transformations)**
- **[Machinescapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Machinescapes)**
- **[Internal hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucination)** ( *[autonomous entities](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Autonomous_entities)* ; *[settings, sceneries, and landscapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Settings,_sceneries,_and_landscapes)* ; *[perspective hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perspective_hallucinations)* and *[scenarios and plots](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenarios_and_plots)* ) - Although 2C-B is technically capable of producing hallucinatory states in a fashion that is on par with [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) or [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT) in its vividness and intensity. In comparison, these effects are extremely rare and inconsistent at common doses, though are usually readily producible at high doses, particularly when taken by [rectal](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Rectal) or [intravenous](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Intravenous) routes. While traditional [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) such as [LSA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSA) , [ayahuasca](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ayahuasca) and [mescaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mescaline) will induce internal hallucinations near consistently at level 5 geometry and above, 2C-B will for most go straight into [Level 8A](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/8A_Geometry) visual geometry. This lack of consistently induced hallucinatory breakthroughs means that for some, 2C-B is simply not as deep of an experience as certain other psychedelics.
- **[Peripheral information misinterpretation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Peripheral_information_misinterpretation)** ### Cognitive effects
 
- The cognitive effects of 2C-B are often described as both insightful and relatively normal in their thought processes even at moderate to high dosages. They are often described as being halfway between [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) and [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) . 
- **[Empathy, affection, and sociability enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Empathy,_affection,_and_sociability_enhancement)** - These feelings of sociability, love and empathy are a little weaker and less sharp than those found on substances such as [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) but still prove stronger and more consistent than other [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) of any class. This has been reported to provide long-lasting therapeutic effects.
- **[Analysis enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Analysis_enhancement)** - This [introspection](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Introspection) dominant effect is only manifested consistently in the context of a non-social setting in which the user is alone.
- **[Anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) & [Paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia)** - while possible at most doses, this effect generally occurs at a considerably lower intensity compared to classical psychedelics such as [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) and [psilocybin mushrooms](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocybin_mushrooms) .
- **[Conceptual thinking](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Conceptual_thinking)**
- **[Delusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusion)**
- **[Creativity enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Creativity_enhancement)**
- **[Emotion enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Emotion_enhancement)**
- **[Immersion enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Immersion_enhancement)**
- **[Novelty enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Novelty_enhancement)**
- **[Increased libido](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_libido)** - Combined with the increased bodily sensations and stimulation, 2C-B is capable of making sexual activity extremely pleasurable.
- **[Increased music appreciation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_music_appreciation)** -
- **[Increased sense of humor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_sense_of_humor)**
- **[Laughter fits](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Laughter_fits)** - Anecdotal reports and literature suggest that 2C-B is capable of producing sudden fits of mild to intense laughter.
- **[Memory suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Memory_suppression)** 
- **[Ego death](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ego_death)**
- **[Personal bias suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Personal_bias_suppression)**
- **[Rejuvenation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Rejuvenation)**
- **[Thought acceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_acceleration)**
- **[Thought connectivity](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_connectivity)**
- **[Time distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Time_distortion)**
- **[Wakefulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness)** ### Auditory effects
 
- - **[Auditory enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_enhancement)**
- **[Auditory distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_distortion)**
- **[Auditory hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_hallucination)** ### Multi-sensory effects
 
- - **[Synaesthesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Synaesthesia)** - In its fullest manifestation, this is a very rare and non-reproducible effect. Increasing the dosage can increase the likelihood of synesthesia, but seems to only be a prominent part of the experience among those who are already predisposed to synaesthetic states. ### Transpersonal effects
 
- While 2C-B has been reported as having the potential to produce transpersonal states, they are reported to occur less consistently or intensely than with classic psychedelics such as [psilocybin mushrooms](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocybin_mushrooms) , [mescaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mescaline) , [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) , or [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT) . 
- **[Existential self-realization](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Existential_self-realization)**
- **[Spirituality enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spirituality_enhancement)**
- **[Unity and interconnectedness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Unity_and_interconnectedness)**
### Combination effects

- **[Cannabis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cannabis)** - Cannabis majorly intensifies and extends both the sensory and cognitive effects of 2C-B. Extreme caution should be exercised with this combination as it can also elevate the [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [confusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Confusion) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) risk of cannabis.
- **[Dissociatives](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociatives)** - When combined with dissociatives, the geometry, euphoria, dissociation, and hallucinatory effects are often greatly enhanced. Dissociative-induced [holes, spaces, and voids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_disconnection#Holes.2C_spaces_and_voids) while under the influence of 2C-B have significantly more vivid visuals than dissociatives alone. It also results in more intense [internal hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucinations) and corresponding [confusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Confusion) which can develop into [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) .
- **[Nitrous](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nitrous)** - Nitrous oxide is commonly used in combination with psychedelics. The two are known to possess powerful cross-synergistic effects, including the capacity to send the user directly into an ["ego death"](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ego_death) state. The speed and intensity with which this occurs are very rapid and the euphoria that can result often leads to the urge to [compulsively redose](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Compulsive_redosing) .
- **[MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA)** - MDMA strongly amplifies the physical, visual, and cognitive effects of 2C-B. This combination is reported to produce strong sensations of euphoric pleasure manifested through distinct body highs, headspaces and uniquely colorful visuals. The synergy between these substances is unpredictable, and it is advised to start with markedly lower doses than one would take for both substances individually. This combination may increase the neurotoxic effects of MDMA, based on its similarity to LSD, which has been found to increase MDMA neurotoxicity.
- **[Alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol)** - Alcohol can increase the disinhibiting and euphoric effects of 2C-B, lending to its use in recreational settings. It can be used in light doses to "take the edge off" a trip as well as dull its psychedelic effects in a manner comparable to benzodiazepines. However, this is not typically recommended due to alcohol’s ability to cause [dehydration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dehydration) and [nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea) and [physical fatigue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_fatigue) which can negatively affect a trip if taken in moderate to high dosages. Heavy drinking is strongly discouraged as it can easily lead to blackouts and unpredictable behavior.
- **[Benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines)** - Depending on the dose, benzodiazepines can slightly to completely reduce the intensity of the cognitive, physical, and visual effects of a 2C-B trip. They are very efficient at stopping ["bad trips"](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bad_trip) at the cost of amnesia and reduced trip intensity. Caution is advised when acquiring them for this purpose due to their high abuse and addiction potential.
- **[Psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics)** - When used in combination with other psychedelics, each substance's physical, cognitive and visual effects intensify and synergize strongly. The synergy between those substances is unpredictable, and for this reason generally not advised. If choosing to combine psychedelics, it is recommended to start with significantly lower dosages than one would take for either substance individually.

## Reagent results

Exposing compounds to the reagents gives a colour change which is indicative of the compound under test.

## Toxicity and harm potential

The toxicity and long-term health effects of recreational 2C-B use have not been studied in any scientific context, and the exact toxic dose is unknown.

Anecdotal evidence suggests that there are no negative health effects attributed to simply trying it by itself at low to moderate doses or using it very sparingly (although nothing can be completely guaranteed).

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this substance.

### Neurotoxicity

2C-B at normal doses is unlikely to be neurotoxic. Through rough extrapolations of data from rat cortical cultures, the IC 50 of neuronal activity may result from a dose of at least a 330-650mg. In other words, users should avoid a dose that large in order to avoid long term damage, but typical doses should be well within a safe range.

### Cardiac risk

Users have reported experiencing hypertension, hyperthermia and tachycardia at higher doses. As such, those with pre-existing heart conditions should avoid using 2C-B, and users monitor their temperature and heart-rate and respond accordingly. Heavy physical exertion while on 2C-B is discouraged.

### Lethal dosage

There is no current data for the LD 50 of 2C-B, but it is thought to be considerably higher than the active dose. [Alexander Shulgin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alexander_Shulgin) reported a 100 mg oral dose taken without apparent harm.

### Dependence and abuse potential

As with other [serotonergic psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonergic_psychedelic) , 2C-B is considered to be non-addictive with a low potential for abuse.

Tolerance to the effects of 2C-B is not built almost immediately after ingestion. There are many anecdotal reports of people ingesting this substance many days in a row (either consecutively or by redosing many many times in a row and tripping continuously for dozens of hours) with no immediate tolerance build up and still building quite slowly even under sustained exposure.

2C-B does not produce cross-tolerance with other serotonergic psychedelics, although most users report other psychedelics affecting 2C-B tolerance. For example 2C-B followed by LSD will not result in any loss of effects whereas LSD followed by 2C-B will. Others report 2C-B following a completely separate tolerance clock to other psychedelics with no cross tolerance being shared between the two, although this seems to be a rare reaction with that individual's personal body chemistry, with the aforementioned one-way tolerance being the case for the very large majority of the population.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **[Lithium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_(medication))** - Lithium is commonly prescribed for the treatment of [bipolar disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder) . There is a large body of anecdotal evidence that suggests taking it with [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) significantly increases the risk of [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) and [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) . As a result, this combination is strictly discouraged.
- **[Cannabis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cannabis)** - Cannabis may have an unexpectedly strong and unpredictable synergy with the effects of 2C-B. Caution is advised with this combination as it can significantly increase the risk of adverse psychological reactions like [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) , and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) . Users are advised to start off with only a fraction of their normal cannabis dose and take long breaks between hits to avoid unintentional overdose.
- **[Stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants)** - Stimulants like [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) , [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) or [methylphenidate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylphenidate) affect many parts of the brain and alter [dopaminergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) function. This combination can increase the risk of [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) , and [thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops) . This interaction may also result in an elevated risk of [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) . [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol)** - Tramadol is well-documented to lower the seizure threshold and [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) may act to trigger seizures in susceptible individuals. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
