## SYNTHESIS
The solids that remained after the above decantation and ether washing were thoroughly ground up under 10 mL methylene chloride and removed by filtration to give 2.73 g of fine white crystals of 5-methoxy-N,N,N-triallyltryptammonium iodide. The infra-red spectrum contained the following major peaks (cm-1): 818, 860, 952, 998, 1085, 1188. To a solution of 1.1 g phenyl mercaptan (10 mM) in 20 mL acetone there was added 0.4 g 50% W/W aqueous NaOH followed by 2.2 g of this quaternary salt, and the mixture was held at reflux on the steam-bath for 18 h. After removal of the volatiles on the rotary evaporator, the residue brown solids were suspended in 75 mL water which was made acidic by the addition of aqueous HCl. This was washed with 3Ã40 mL methylene chloride (the washings were saved), made basic with 5% aqueous NaOH and extracted with 3Ã40 mL methylene chloride. The combined extracts were stripped of solvent on the rotary evaporator yielding .12 g of crude 5-MeO-DALT as a light brown oil that crystallized. The methylene chloride washings (saved above) was extracted with dilute H2SO4 (leaving the diphenyldisulfide reaction product in the organic phase), made basic, extracted with methylene chloride which, on being stripped of solvents on the rotary evaporator, yielded an additional 0.37 g additional crude 5-MeO-DALT. These two lots were combined and distilled at the KugelRohr to give 0.32 g of a fraction boiling at 155â165 Â°C at 20 microns. This was converted to the hydrochloride salt as described above, yielding 0.30 g of 5-MeO-DALT HCl. GCMS analysis showed this the be 95% pure with a 5% contamination with the mono-deallylated base 5-MeO-NALT. The fragmentation pattern of this base (m/z) was: 70 (allylaminomethylene, 50%), 160, 161 (5-methoxyindolemethylene, 40%, 100%), 230 (parent, 10%).


## DOSAGE

## DURATION
(with 16 mg orally) âThe music was fabulous, as was the sex and neither of us had a problem with orgasm. But there was a total lack of imageryâless than I would normally have to the music when unstoned, so there might have been an actual suppression. I was pretty much baseline by the third hour.â

(with 20 mg orally) âItâs coming on strongly in 15 minutes, and at the half hour point I am at a +++ with eyes closedâbut nothing with them open! No hang-over.â


## EXTENSIONS AND COMMENTARY
There are a number of modifications of the two double bonds on there on the nitrogen alkyl groups that would be interesting to explore. If they were changed from double bonds to triple bonds, one would have 5-methoxy-N,N-dipropargyltryptamine, or 5-MeO-DPRT. I have made a little bit of it but it was quite impure and difficult to clean up. The complexity of the GCMS patterns suggested that there might be some chemistry going on between the two propargyl groups.

Another direction possible for modifying the structure would be to relocate the oxygen in indole ring over to the 4-position. 4-Methoxytryptamine is commercially available, and it should be directly substitutable for the 5-methoxytryptamine used in this synthetic process giving rise to 4-MeO-DALT. Yet further out, what about starting the 4-benzyloxytryptamine and walking the same path? The product could be easily stripped of the benzyl ether by the usual catalytic hydrogenation, giving rise to the diallyl analogue of psilocin, 4-HO-DALT. I would wager a ten dollar bet that the acetate ester of this material, 4-AcO-DALT would be in the brain within minutes of swallowing the pill.

There are a lot of interesting extensions, but all of them would call for careful chemistry. And, of course, the essential care of tasting new things in very small increasing doses. Some of these could be extremely potent.
