**2-Fluoromethamphetamine** (also known as **2-FMA** ) is a novel [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) substance of the [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) class. It is a structural analog of [methamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) and is related to [2-FA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2-FA) , [3-FA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/3-FA) , and [4-FMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-FMA) . 2-FMA produces its stimulant effects through action at [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) and [norepinephrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Norepinephrine) receptors in the brain.

The sale of 2-FMA on the online [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) market was first reported in August 2007. . It appeared alongside other fluorinated amphetamines like [2-FA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2-FA) and [4-FA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-FA) . It appears to be unknown in the clinical and research literature.

[Subjective effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effects) include [stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation) , [focus enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Focus_enhancement) , [motivation enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motivation_enhancement) , [increased libido](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_libido) , [appetite suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Appetite_suppression) , and [euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Euphoria) . It is commonly taken either orally or via insufflation and is reported to be highly unpleasant and dangerous to vaporize as the heat can break off the carbon-fluoride bond which in turn can be very toxic. 2-FMA is commonly compared to [lisdexamfetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Lisdexamfetamine) (Vyvanse) in its duration, potency and efficacy as a study or productivity aid. A substantial increase in adverse effects like [high blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure) and [increased heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate) are often reported for dosages above the heavy dosage range.

Very little data exists about the pharmacological properties, metabolism, and toxicity of 2-FMA. It is strongly advised to use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Harm_reduction_practices) if using this substance.

## Chemistry

2-Fluoromethamphetamine (2-FMA) is a synthetic molecule of the [substituted amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Substituted_amphetamine) class. Molecules of the amphetamine class contain a phenethylamine core featuring a phenyl ring bound to an amino (NH2) group through an ethyl chain with an additional methyl substitution at R α (i.e., amphetamines are alpha-methylated phenethylamines). 2-FMA contains a methyl group bound to the terminal amine R N of the amphetamine core, a substitution it shares with [methamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) .

2-FMA is the 2-position fluorinated analog of [methamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) and the N-methylated homolog of [2-FA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2-FA) (2-fluoroamphetamine).

## Pharmacology

Although 2-FMA has not been formally studied on the same level as traditional [amphetamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamines) , it is thought that it acts as both a [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) and [norepinephrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Norepinephrine) [releasing agent](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Releasing_agent) . This means it effectively increases the levels of the norepinephrine and dopamine in the brain by binding to and partially blocking the transporter proteins that normally remove them from the [synaptic cleft](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Synaptic_cleft) . This allows dopamine and norepinephrine to accumulate within the brain, resulting in stimulating and euphoric effects.

## Subjective effects

In comparison to other substituted amphetamines, 2-FMA is reported to be relatively free of side effects such as [nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea) , [high blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/High_blood_pressure) , [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) and an uncomfortable [offset](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Offset) ("comedown"). It is considered to be a functional stimulant for performing general productivity tasks in a manner similar to [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) or [lisdexamfetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Lisdexamfetamine) (Vyvanse). However, at higher doses, it typically loses its productivity and focus-enhancing effects and begins to take on a recreational character due to the distracting euphoria that it can produce. Majority of users report through anecdotal reports that this has a ceiling effect with high dose (Heavy+) ranges where many report of the uncomfortable effects from stimulants when passing or entering the strong-heavy dose range.

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)** - In terms of its effects on the physical energy levels of the user, 2-FMA is usually considered to be very energetic and stimulating in a fashion that is slightly weaker to that of [methamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) , but stronger than that of [modafinil](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Modafinil) , [caffeine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Caffeine) , and [methylphenidate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylphenidate) . The particular style of stimulation which 2-FMA presents can be described as forced, but compared to many other stimulants such as [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) many describe it as a very "clean" stimulation. This means that, at higher dosages, it becomes difficult or impossible to keep still as jaw clenching, involuntary bodily shakes and vibrations become present, resulting in extreme shaking of the entire body, unsteadiness of the hands, and a general loss of fine motor control.
- **[Physical euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria)** - This effect is more prominent at higher dosages and is typically weaker then that of other stimulants such as [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) , [lisdexamfetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Lisdexamfetamine) and [methylphenidate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylphenidate)
- **[Tactile enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_enhancement)**
- **[Stamina enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stamina_enhancement)**
- **[Abnormal heartbeat](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Abnormal_heartbeat)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Increased heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Increased blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Appetite suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Appetite_suppression)**
- **[Bronchodilation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bronchodilation)**
- **[Dehydration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dehydration)**
- **[Dry mouth](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dry_mouth)**
- **[Frequent urination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Frequent_urination)**
- **[Increased bodily temperature](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_bodily_temperature)**
- **[Increased perspiration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_perspiration)**
- **[Nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea)**
- **[Pupil dilation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pupil_dilation)** - This effect is typically experienced only at higher dosages and is more prominent on the comedown.
- **[Teeth grinding](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Teeth_grinding)** - This component is more prominent as higher dosages and can be considered to be less intense when compared with that of [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) .
- **[Temporary erectile dysfunction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Temporary_erectile_dysfunction)**
- **[Vasoconstriction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction)**
- **[Restless legs](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Restless_legs)** ### Visual effects
 
- The visual effects of 2-FMA are usually less consistent and only mildly noticeable at higher dosages. They are somewhat comparable to [deliriants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Deliriants) and occur more readily in darker areas. 
#### Distortions
 
- **[Drifting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_drifting)** *( [breathing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_drifting#Breathing) and [morphing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_drifting#Morphing) )* - This effect is usually subtle and barely noticeable and only occurs at higher dosages or when combined with [cannabis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cannabis) .
- **[Brightness alteration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Brightness_alteration)** - 2-FMA can make spaces seem brighter as a result of its pupil dilating effects.
 
#### Hallucinatory states
 
- **[Transformations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Transformations)** - This effect occurs very rarely, and typically only when the user has taken high doses, is coming down, or has been awake for unusually long periods. It is usually very mild when it does occur. ### Cognitive effects
 
- - **[Analysis enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Analysis_enhancement)**
- **[Anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety)** & **[Paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia)** - This effect typically occurs with overly high doses or after redosing and staying awake for extended periods of time.
- **[Cognitive euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_euphoria)**
- **[Compulsive redosing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Compulsive_redosing)**
- **[Delusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusion)**
- **[Disinhibition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Disinhibition)**
- **[Ego inflation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ego_inflation)**
- **[Emotion suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Emotion_suppression)**
- **[Focus enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Focus_enhancement)**
- **[Increased libido](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_libido)**
- **[Increased music appreciation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_music_appreciation)**
- **[Motivation enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motivation_enhancement)**
- **[Bodily control enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bodily_control_enhancement)**
- **[Thought acceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_acceleration)**
- **[Thought organization](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_organization)**
- **[Wakefulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness)**
- **[Time distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Time_distortion)** - This can be described as the experience of time speeding up and passing much quicker than it usually would when sober. ### After effects
 
- The effects which occur during the [offset](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Offset) of a [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) experience generally feel negative and uncomfortable in comparison to the effects which occurred during its [peak](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Peak) . This is often referred to as a "comedown" and occurs because of [neurotransmitter](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurotransmitter) depletion. Its effects commonly include: 
- **[Anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety)**
- **[Cognitive fatigue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_fatigue)**

## Toxicity and harm potential

The toxicity and long-term health effects of recreational 2-FMA use do not seem to have been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dosage is unknown. This is because 2-FMA has a very limited history of human usage.

Anecdotal reports from those who have tried 2-FMA suggest that there do not seem to be any negative health effects attributed to simply trying this substance at low to moderate doses by itself or using it sparingly (but nothing can be completely guaranteed).

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this substance.

### Dependence and abuse potential

As with other [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) , the chronic use of 2-FMA can be considered moderately addictive with a high potential for abuse and is capable of causing psychological dependence among certain users. When addiction has developed, cravings and [withdrawal effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Withdrawal_effects) may occur if a person suddenly stops their usage.

Tolerance to many of the effects of 2-FMA develops with prolonged and repeated use. This results in users having to administer increasingly large doses to achieve the same effects. After that, it takes about 3 - 7 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 1 - 2 weeks to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). 2-FMA presents cross-tolerance with all [dopaminergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) , meaning that after the consumption of 2-FMA all [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) will have a reduced effect.

### Psychosis

The use of compounds in the amphetamine class at high dosages for prolonged periods of time can potentially result in a stimulant psychosis that may present with a variety of symptoms (e.g., [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/External_hallucinations) , or [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) ). A review on treatment for amphetamine, [dextroamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) , and [methamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) abuse-induced psychosis states that about 5–15% of users fail to recover completely. The same review asserts that, based upon at least one trial, [antipsychotic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antipsychotic) medications effectively resolve the symptoms of acute amphetamine psychosis.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **Alcohol** - Drinking alcohol on stimulants is considered risky because it reduces the sedative effects of the alcohol that the body uses to gauge drunkenness. This often leads to excessive drinking with greatly reduced inhibitions, increasing the risk of liver damage and increased dehydration. The effects of stimulants will also allow one to drink past a point where they might normally pass out, increasing the risk. If you do decide to do this then you should set a limit of how much you will drink each hour and stick to it, bearing in mind that you will feel the alcohol and the stimulant less.
- **GHB** / **GBL** - Stimulants increase respiration rate allowing a higher dose of sedatives. If the stimulant wears off first then the depressant effects of the GHB/GBL may overcome the user and cause respiratory arrest.
- **Opioids** - Stimulants increase respiration rate allowing a higher dose of opiates. If the stimulant wears off first then the opiate may overcome the patient and cause respiratory arrest.
- **Cocaine** - The rewarding effects of cocaine are mediated by DAT inhibition, and an increase of exocytosis of dopamine through the cell membrane. Amphetamine reverses the direction of DAT and the direction vesicular transports within the cell by a pH mediated mechanism of displacement, thus excludes the regular mechanism of dopamine release through means of exocytosis because the effects Na+/K+ ATPase are inhibited. You will find cardiac effects with the combination of cocaine and amphetamine due to a SERT mediated mechanism from the subsequent activation of 5-HT2B, which is an effect of serotonin-related valvulopathy. Amphetamines generally cause hypertension in models of abuse, and this combination can increase the chances of syncope due to turbulent blood flow during valve operation. The rewarding mechanisms of cocaine are reversed by administration of amphetamine.
- **Cannabis** - Stimulants increase [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) levels and the risk of [thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops) and [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) which can lead to negative experiences.
- **Caffeine** - This combination of stimulants is generally considered unnecessary and may increase strain on the heart, as well as potentially causing anxiety and physical discomfort.
- **Tramadol** - Tramadol and stimulants both increase the risk of seizures.
- **DXM** - Both substances raise heart rate, in extreme cases, panic attacks caused by these substances have led to more serious heart issues.
- **Ketamine** - Combining amphetamine and ketamine may result in psychoses that resemble schizophrenia, but not worse than the psychoses produced by either substance alone, but this is debatable. This is due to amphetamines ability to attenuated the disruption of working memory caused by ketamine. Amphetamine alone may result in grandiosity, paranoia, or somatic delusions with little to no effect on negative symptoms. Ketamine, however, will result in thought disorders, disruption of executive functioning, and delusions due to a modification of conception. These mechanisms are due to an increase of dopaminergic activity in the mesolimbic pathway caused by amphetamine due to its pharmacology effecting dopamine, and due to a disruption of dopaminergic functioning in the mesocortical pathways via NMDA antagonism effects of ketamine. Combining the two, you may expect mainly thought disorder along with positive symptoms.
- **PCP** - Increases risk of tachycardia, hypertension, and manic states.
- **Methoxetamine** - Increases risk of tachycardia, hypertension, and manic states.
- **Psychedelics** (e.g. ***[LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) , [mescaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mescaline) , [psilocybin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocybin)*** ) - Increases risk of [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , and [thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops) . 
- **25x-NBOMe** - Amphetamines and NBOMes both provide considerable stimulation that when combined they can result in tachycardia, hypertension, vasoconstriction and, in extreme cases, heart failure. The anxiogenic and focusing effects of stimulants are also not good in combination with psychedelics as they can lead to unpleasant thought loops. NBOMes are known to cause seizures and stimulants can increase this risk.
- **2C-T-x** - Suspected of mild MAOI properties. May increase the risk of hypertensive crisis.
- **5-MeO-xxT** - Suspected of mild MAOI properties. May increase the risk of hypertensive crisis.
- **DOx**
- **aMT** - aMT has MAOI properties which may interact unfavorably with amphetamines.
- **MAOIs** - MAO-B inhibitors can increase the potency and duration of phenethylamines unpredictably. MAO-A inhibitors with amphetamine can lead to hypertensive crises.

## Legal status

2-FMA is currently a gray area compound within all parts of the world, meaning its regulation lies in a legal gray area and that it is not known to be specifically illegal ("scheduled") within any country. However, people may still be charged for its possession under certain circumstances such as under analogue laws and with the intent to sell or consume.

- **Canada** : 2-FMA would be considered Schedule I as it is an analogue of Amphetamine.
- **China** : As of October 2015 2-FMA is a controlled substance in China.
- **France** : As of december 2024, 2-FMA is not explicitly scheduled. It is thus legal to possess, although in a grey area.
- **Germany** : 2-FMA is controlled under Anlage I BtMG ( *Narcotics Act, Schedule I* ) as of December 13, 2014. It is illegal to manufacture, possess, import, export, buy, sell, procure or dispense it without a license.
- **New Zealand** : 2-FMA is an amphetamine analogue, so is a Schedule 3 controlled substance in New Zealand.
- **Switzerland** : 2-FMA is a controlled substance specifically named under Verzeichnis E.
- **Turkey:** 2-FMA is a classed as drug and is illegal to possess, produce, supply, or import.
- **The Netherlands:** 2-FMA is currently legal, but it is part of a substance group that may be banned soon as part of a recently passed law on New Psychoactive Substances (NPS).
- **United Kingdom** : 2-FMA is considered a Class A drug as a result of the amphetamine analogue clause of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971.
- **Ukraine** : 2-FMA is considered a narcotic and is illegal.

*Source: https://thedrugclassroom.com/video/2-fluoromethamphetamine-2-fma/*

2-Fluoromethamphetamine (2-FMA) is a phenethylamine and amphetamine that’s been used since around 2012. It’s a research chemical and little formal knowledge about the substance is available.

It’s been described as an alternative to amphetamine and lisdexamfetamine, albeit with a lower recreational potential. 2-FMA primarily offers productive rather than recreational effects. Most users describe it as less inherently recreational than amphetamine.

---

2-FMA = 2-Fluoromethamphetamine

PubChem: 24257263

Molecular formula: C10H14FN

Molecular weight: 167.227 g/mol

IUPAC: 1-(2-fluorophenyl)-N-methylpropan-2-amine

---

## Dose

#### Oral

Light: 10 – 20 mg

Common: 20 – 40 mg

Strong: 40 – 50 mg

Most people find there’s little reason to go beyond 40-50 mg. After that point, the stimulation may increase and the duration could be somewhat extended, but the chance of negative effects increases.

---

## Timeline

#### Oral

Total: 5 – 8 hours

Onset: 00:30 – 01:00

Most of the core effects tend to decline within 5-6 hours, but wakefulness can persist for 8-10 hours. Strong+ doses can extend the effects to some degree.

## Experience Reports

[Erowid](https://erowid.org/experiences/subs/exp_2Fluoromethamphetamine.shtml)

## Effects

#### Positive

- Stimulation
- Increased motivation
- Mood improvement
- Increased concentration
- Increased sociability
- Greater talkativeness

#### Negative

- Increased heart rate
- Dry mouth
- Appetite reduction
- Increased blood pressure
- Sweating
- Muscle tension
- Vasoconstriction

It’s largely a functional/productive stimulant rather than a euphoric and inherently recreational substance. Many users describe it as “clean,” with it being good for productivity and relatively free from negative physical effects. It’s not very “pushy.”

The effects have been described as “calm.” A lot of users find they can get the stimulation they’re looking for without feeling like they’re on a strong stimulant. Usually people don’t end up overflowing with energy to the point that sitting down and working is difficult, something that can occur with certain stimulants.

While you may be happier while on the drug, it’s not very euphoric. And even though it can offer an increase in motivation, becoming incredibly happy regardless of what you’re working on isn’t as common.

Some people have compared it to lisdexamfetamine. Both are fairly long-lasting and good for productivity at common doses. However, 2-FMA tends to have a lower recreational potential than lisdexamfetamine or amphetamine.

There haven been cases of people using it daily or near daily, occasionally as an alternative for prescription amphetamines. Since less is known about 2-FMA, this isn’t recommended.

The drug is typically more enjoyable and noticeable than modafinil, but they’re both more productive than recreational.

#### Negatives

As long as you take a common dose, it’s usually free of most negative effects. This means little to no jitteriness, noticeable cardiovascular effects, sweating, or anxiety.

With higher doses (e.g. over 50 mg), jitteriness, sweating, jaw tightness, muscle tension, and possibly heart palpitations can develop.

#### Comedown & after effects

Most users find 2-FMA leads to effectively no comedown or after effects when taken at common doses.

Strong+ doses can lead to some negative after effects, including transient low mood, low motivation, a flat affect, and even moderate depression into the following day.

#### Combinations

A combination known as the “ [Borax Combo](https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/224llv/the_mdma_experience_can_be_replicated_with_less/) ” has gained some attention online. It can include various substances with the goal of offering an MDMA-like effect.

One of the combinations is 2-FMA, 5-MAPB, and 4-HO-MET. 2-FMA is largely just offering stimulation in that combo.

We don’t know how safe combining those drugs is, but if taken like MDMA (e.g. every few months) it’s probably not too concerning for healthy people.

---

## Chemistry & Pharmacology

#### Chemistry

2-FMA is a substituted amphetamine. It’s a member of a group of fluorinated amphetamine derivatives, which also features substances like 2-FA and [4-FA](https://thedrugclassroom.com/video/4-fluoroamphetamine-4-fa/) .

#### Pharmacology

We don’t know its mechanism due to a lack of research. An educated guess is that it’s functioning as a reuptake inhibitor and releasing agent, particularly for dopamine and norepinephrine.

There could potentially be other actions, such as at VMAT2 and TAAR1.

---

## History

#### August 2007

Four capsules were delivered to Royal Adelaide Hospital in Australia. The capsules appeared to have originated from Neorganics, an Israeli company that was selling drug-filled capsules worldwide under various brand names.

One of the capsules seemed to match up with a Neorganics product called Sub Coca 2. Upon examination, it was found to contain 2-FMA and a-phthalimidopropiophenone.

#### 2013

It was reported to the EMCDDA only once before 2013 (in 2012).

Most user reports have appeared from 2013 onward, though it was on the market before then.

#### September 2013 – June 2015

Of 162 seized drug samples analyzed in Italy, 2-FMA was found in only a couple, making it quite uncommon.

#### 2017

2-FMA is still on the market, but it hasn’t become one of the top research chemicals.

---

## Legal Status

#### US (as of April 2017)

Uncontrolled

#### Controlled (list may not be complete)

China, Canada, Germany, and the UK.

---

## Safety

As we don’t have much information about the drug, it’s difficult to say how safe it is, especially with long-term use. It’s wise to use the drug at common doses, infrequently, and without combinations.

The primary concerns people have mentioned are with cardiovascular and kidney health. Infrequent use of common doses likely isn’t an issue for healthy people.

#### Overdose

There aren’t any formal overdose cases to go on. However, 2-FMA could conceivable lead to hyperstimulation, anxiety, cardiovascular issues, and a higher seizure risk if enough is used.

#### Fatalities (combinations)

Case 1 (Karinen)

- Male in his early 20s
- Took 6 codeine/acetaminophen tablets
- He also appeared to take, according to his girlfriend, 3-MMC and 4-FMA. 
- Those had been purchased online.
- He laid down after using the drugs. 
- Within five minutes, he was snoring and it wasn’t possible to wake him up.
- His lips turned bluish.
- Paramedics called, failed to resuscitate.
- Despite him having used “4-FMA,” the retention time didn’t match upon analysis. 
- 2-FMA was ultimately found instead.
- Toxicology 
- Peripheral whole blood 
- AH-7921: 0.43 mg/L
- Codeine: 0.42 mg/L
- Codeine-6-glucuronide: 0.77 mg/L
- Acetaminophen: 19 mg/L
- 2-FMA: 0.0069 mg/L
- 3-MMC: 0.0021 mg/L
- TDC view: 2-FMA was probably a minor or entirely unimportant substance in this case.

#### Risky Combos (list may not be complete)

Other stimulants, psychedelics, MAOIs, and tramadol.

2-Fluoromethamphetamine (2-FMA) is a stimulant drug of the amphetamine family which has been used as a designer drug. 2-FMA is commonly compared to lisdexamfetamine (Vyvanse), and dextroamphetamine due to its efficacy as a study or productivity aid. 2-FMA is purported to produce somewhat less euphoria than comparable amphetamines, likely due to its main mechanism of action consisting of norepinephrine reuptake inhibition.

## Chemistry

2-Fluoromethamphetamine is fluorinated analogue of methamphetamine, and is a regioisomer of 3-FMA and 4-FMA.
It does not activate the serotonin receptors, including 5-HT2A, unlike most stimulant drugs of the amphetamine family.

## Legal status

### Canada

As of 1996, 2-FMA is a controlled substance in Canada, due to being an analog of methamphetamine.

### China
