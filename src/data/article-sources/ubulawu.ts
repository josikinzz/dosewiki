## Subjective Experience

Enticed by stories of its ancient ritual use in Africa, I chose ubulawu for one of my
first forays into the botanical arena.

I paid much attention to detail during the preparation, following authentic
techniques as closely as I could. The procedure included crushing the root, shaking it
in half a jar of water until froth appeared on the top, and spooning this into my
mouth. This task was performed first thing in the morning, on an empty stomach.

Whilst it is often impossible to determine the difference between placebo and
minimal, there were no wild or vivid dreams, or in fact, anything else. I experienced
practically nothing.

In retrospect I can’t necessarily draw too many general conclusions from this. I have
stated elsewhere that the source of botanicals is usually vital. Here, the dried root
perhaps gave the game away: it looked old; so old that it may have lost whatever
psychoactivity it originally carried.

Internet reports suggest that this is worthy of further experimentation, which I will
endeavour to undertake in the future, should the opportunity arise.

## Summary
Silene undulata (Xhosa: iindlela zimhlophe—"white ways/paths", also known as Silene capensis, and African dream root) is a plant native to the Eastern Cape of South Africa.

## Cultivation
In cultivation, S. undulata is an easily grown, but moisture hungry herb.  It is tolerant of extreme heat, >40 °C (104 °F), and moderate cold, −5 °C (23 °F). A moisture retentive seedbed is essential. The fragrant flowers open at night and close in the day. It is a biennial to short lived perennial and the root can be harvested after the second year.

## Uses
Silene undulata is regarded by the Xhosa people as a sacred plant. Its root is traditionally used to induce vivid (and according to the Xhosa, prophetic) lucid dreams during the initiation process of traditional healers, classifying it a naturally occurring oneirogen similar to the more well-known dream herb Calea zacatechichi.

## Constituents
Silene undulata has been found to contain β-carbolines such as norharman, harmalol, and harmaline, and harmine, as well as ibogaine. In addition, these constituents were predicted to act as serotonin 5-HT2A receptor agonists. These components, and in turn serotonin 5-HT2A receptor activation, may be involved in the psychoactive effects of Silene undulata.
