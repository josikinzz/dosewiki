# 6-APB
*Source: https://thedrugclassroom.com/video/6-apb/*

6-APB is a stimulant and entactogen that’s similar in structure to MDA. It provides effects that are reminiscent of those provided by MDA and MDMA.

Compared to MDMA, 6-APB tends to offer more visual effects and a stronger psychedelic feel. It’s usually said to be at least as entactogenic.

Due to a lack of information about the drug, it’s hard to say how safe it is, especially with long-term use. Common doses don’t appear acutely dangerous for healthy people. Overdoses certainly can occur and they may feature paranoia, anxiety, headache, agitation, and hypertension.

6-APB has only been used since ~2010.
