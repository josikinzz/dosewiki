## Subjective Experience

4-FA became commercially available as a research chemical circa 2001. In terms of
effect it is often positioned, subjectively, as being somewhere between amphetamine
and MDMA. At the time of writing it is increasingly popular, particularly in the
Netherlands.

Despite the reference figures above, there are a substantial number of posts across
Internet forums citing significantly higher doses, many in the 100mg to 200mg
range, and some even higher. In this respect, Azarius.com states:

\`\`\`
“According to different sources, a dosage between 80-140 mg is considered
common; a dose of 50-80 mg produces a mild trip”.
\`\`\`

This probably reflects the broad consensus.

I elect to apply a dose limit on the session by measuring 150mg and placing the rest
out of immediate reach. Of this, I plan to take 50mg, and possibly redose with
another 50mg if the experience is positive enough to merit deeper exploration. The
other 50mg is reserved in case the threshold is not reached.

\`\`\`
T+0:00 50mg is bombed orally in rizla paper. I also create two small 25mg
packets for the potential redosing, and leave the final 50mg in the scale pan.
[2:55pm]
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+0:30 Something may be happening. I am warm, content, clammy and a
little sweaty. I feel slightly uplifted and a little light headed.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+0:45 As there has been no significant change during the last 15 minutes I
begin to contemplate the first of those redose packets. I ate a small bowl of
muesli about three hours ago, so stomach content shouldn't be having a
significant effect.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+1:00 Although I am not immersed in stimulation or empathy, there does
appear to be an upswing in intensity. I therefore hold off the 25mg redose. I
walk around occasionally to assess the effects. I do feel quite comfortable and
fairly happy.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+1:15 I decide to redose: 25mg is bombed. I have now dosed 75mg in total.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+1:30 At 90 minutes the onset of the original 50mg should be largely
completed.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
I am in a reasonable place, but not firing to the same degree as I was on
amphetamine or MDMA, for example. Having stated this, I sampled a far
higher dose of those two than I should have.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
I will resist the final 25mg for the next 15 minutes to see where this goes.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+1:45 The final 25mg is bombed. I am now at my planned maximum of
100mg. I will draw a line in the sand here, by taking approximately 10mg of
the remaining 50mg, and binning the rest.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+2:15 The good news is that I don't feel any compulsive urge to redose. This
is contrary to my experience with amphetamine and methamphetamine. I feel
rather more like I did whilst under the influence of MDMA, in that there is
stimulation there, but it is not overwhelming or totally dominant.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
I am now fully aware that I am solidly experiencing a drug trip. I am still
warm, with the occasional hot flush, and my mind drifts into a mild blissful
state. I am generally content. My pupils are dilated, but not fully so. There is
no gurning or jaw tension.
\`\`\`

\`\`\`
Is there any horn?
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
At this point, not particularly. I didn't experience this aspect with MDMA
either, but certainly did with amphetamine. I feel that I could chose to engage
on a take it or leave it basis, but at this particular dose I feel none of the wild
compulsive sex drive that is sometimes reported for this chemical.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+3:00 This has now strengthened somewhat. There is slightly more horn and
more strength to the overall experience. I am guessing that the final redose is
kicking in.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+3:45 Having become rather more intense the experience has now settled
again. I feel that it has reached a plateau, where I expect it to remain for a
while.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
This is very pleasant, with a sense of positivity and contentedness (including
an empathetic edge) without taking me flying.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+4:15 I remain on the plateau I referred to above. The question is, how long
will this last? There are some reports of very lengthy duration and difficulty
sleeping, which I hope are false.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
I eat a small meal with some fruit juice. Note that I have been sipping water
throughout, to avoid any threat of dehydration.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+6:00 The experience has wound down to a lower level. The effects are still
evident, but are of significantly lower intensity than earlier.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+17:00 The effects continued to fade until I retired to bed at 10:37, which
was seven and a half hours after the first dose. I tossed and turned, unable to
drop off. As I was wide awake at 1:30 am, I popped 1mg of Etizolam.
Thereafter, I slept through until 7:30am.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
On rising and heading for coffee, I felt a little groggy, but generally well.
\`\`\`
It could be that to fly really high on this I would need to consume a significantly
higher dose, as is suggested by a variety of Internet trip reports. However, at this
dose it was nice enough, and I can see the logic of comparisons with MDMA. I
experienced quite a mild and gentle journey, with plenty of feel-good factor.

On the flip side, alarmingly, I have recently been reading reports suggesting that 4-
FA has occasionally caused cerebral hemorrhaging. In urging caution regarding this,
I would particularly stress the need for restraint with respect to dosage.

Finally, note that for a few days following this experiment I experienced a perceptible
comedown in terms of flatness. Appropriate planning and aftercare is therefore
strongly recommended (see MDMA for further information).

Canada #
 
4-fluoroamphetamine is not listed under Canadian law, but Health Canada considers it an analogue of amphetamine, and thus a Schedule III controlled substance. See [http://isomerdesign.com/Cdsa/HC/StatusDecisions/A-2013-00235%20-%20PDFs/C-4-Fluoroamphetamine-2009-06-19.pdf](http://isomerdesign.com/Cdsa/HC/StatusDecisions/A-2013-00235%20-%20PDFs/C-4-Fluoroamphetamine-2009-06-19.pdf) . "The drug is currently not listed specifically on the CDSA. However, Item 1 of Schedule III is, “Amphetamines, their salts, derivatives, isomers and analogues and salts of derivatives, isomers and analogues including.” As analogue is defined in the CDSA as, 'a substance that, in relation to a controlled substance, has a substantially similar chemical structure', 4-fluoroamphetamine must be considered an analogue of amphetamine."

**4-Fluoroamphetamine** (also known as **4-FA** , **4-FMP** , **para-Fluoroamphetamine** , **PAL-303** and colloquially as **Flux** ) is a novel synthetic [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Substituted_amphetamine) compound that produces a unique progressive mixture of [entactogenic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entactogen) and [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) effects when [administered](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Routes_of_administration) . It is part of a series of fluorinated amphetamine analog that initially included such compounds as [2-FA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2-FA) , [2-FMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2-FMA) , and [3-FA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/3-FA) .

Anecdotal reports have described the subjective effects of 4-FA as having a moderate [MDMA-like](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) [entactogenic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entactogenic) onset for the initial few hours of the experience that then gradually transitions into traditional [amphetamine-type](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) [stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation) (for a total duration of around 6 to 8 hours) with residual effects that can last a few hours afterward. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

4-FA is rarely found on the streets but was commonly sold as a grey area [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) by online vendors along with related compounds such as [2-FMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2-FMA) and [3-FA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/3-FA) . Very little data exists about the pharmacological properties, metabolism, and toxicity of 4-FA, and it has only a brief history of human usage. Due to its strong psychostimulant effects, likely habit-forming properties as well as poorly understood toxicity profile, it is strongly recommended that one use proper [harm reduction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Harm_reduction) practices if choosing to use this substance.

## Chemistry

4-Fluoroamphetamine (4-FA) is a synthetic molecule of the [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Substituted_amphetamine) family. Molecules of the amphetamine class contain a [phenethylamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamine) core featuring a phenyl ring bound to an amino (NH 2 ) group through an ethyl chain with an additional methyl substitution at R α . Amphetamines are alpha-methylated phenethylamines. 4-fluoroamphetamine contains a fluorine atom at R 4 of its phenyl ring and is a fluorinated analogue of amphetamine.

## Pharmacology

4-Fluoroamphetamine acts as a releasing agent and reuptake inhibitor of dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine producing stimulating amphetamine-like effects at lower doses and euphoric, entactogenic effects similar to MDMA at dosages above 100mg. The mechanism of action of 4-FA effectively boosts the levels of the norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin [neurotransmitters](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurotransmitters) in higher doses in the brain by binding to and partially blocking the transporter proteins that normally remove those monoamines from the synaptic cleft. This allows dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin to accumulate within the brain, resulting in stimulating, euphoric and [entactogenic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entactogen) effects.

## Subjective effects

It is commonly reported that the first three to four hours of 4-FA present distinct [entactogenic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entactogenic) effects that have been reported as feeling somewhat similar to MDMA although not quite as powerful. This is thought to correlate with the duration in which it is promoting the release of [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) (in addition to [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) and [norepinephrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Norepinephrine) ). After this first phase of the experience, the effect then shifts towards something which feels like classic [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) stimulation which can persist for an extended period. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

**Do not use 4-FA if you have a history of heart-related issues or experience a severe headache after its use.** We have been made aware of a report released by Trimbos-instituut and Nationaal Vergiftigingen Informatie Centrum (NVIC), describing incidents of strokes after an increased use of 4-FA. In addition to the common amphetamine-like effects (agitation, anxiety, tachycardia, hypertension, chest pain et al.), serious cardio- and cerebrovascular complications have been reported, including rhythm (sinus arrhythmia, ventricular extrasystoles (bigeminy), conduction disturbances) and acute cardiac failure. Although a causal relationship has not been confirmed, when presented with a severe headache and lateralization after 4-FA usage, a medical evaluation at an emergency department should be conducted immediately.

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)** - The first few hours of the 4-FA experience are commonly reported to have overtones of the type of sedation that is associated with the serotonin-releasing properties of [entactogens](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entactogens) like [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) . After these entactogenic effects fade and the stimulating effects become predominant. The stimulation which 4-FA produces throughout the entirety of the experience be described as being slightly weaker in intensity to [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) and less forceful than traditional [dopaminergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopaminergic) stimulants such as [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) .
- **[Spontaneous bodily sensations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_bodily_sensations)** - The "body high" of 4-FA can be characterized as a moderate to extreme euphoric tingling sensation that encompasses the entire body. It is capable of becoming overwhelmingly pleasurable at higher doses. This sensation maintains a consistent presence that steadily rises with the onset and hits its limit once the peak has been reached. 
- **[Physical euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria)** - This effect is extremely intense when compared to its physical stimulation.
- **[Tactile enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_enhancement)**
- **[Bodily control enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bodily_control_enhancement)**
- **[Stamina enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stamina_enhancement)**
- **[Temperature regulation suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Temperature_regulation_suppression)**

- **[Increased heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate)**
- **[Increased blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure)**
- **[Vibrating vision](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vibrating_vision)** - At high doses, a person's eyeballs may begin to spontaneously wiggle back and forth in a rapid motion, causing the vision to become blurry and temporarily out of focus. This is a condition known as [nystagmus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nystagmus) and is considered to be harmless in most cases.
- **[Headaches](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Headaches)**
- **[Muscle contractions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_contractions)**
- **[Appetite suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Appetite_suppression)**

- **[Teeth grinding](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Teeth_grinding)**
- **[Seizure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizure)** - This is a rare effect but is thought to be able to occur in those predisposed to them, especially when taking heavier-than-recommended doses or redosing while in physically taxing conditions such as being dehydrated, fatigued, undernourished, or overheated. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] ### Visual effects
 
- #### Enhancements
 
- **[Colour enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_enhancement)**
- **[Pattern recognition enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition_enhancement)** ### Auditory effects

- **[Disinhibition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Disinhibition)**
- **[Empathy, affection, and sociability enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Empathy,_affection,_and_sociability_enhancement)** - In comparison to other substances, this effect can be described as identical to the effects produced by [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) , but with less intensity. Like **[euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_euphoria)** , it is most present at dosages above 100mg.
- **[Cognitive euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_euphoria)** - This effect can be described in its manifestation as a series of euphoric waves that recede and reappear randomly throughout the experience. It is most present at dosages above 100mg.
- **[Thought acceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_acceleration)**

- **[Compulsive redosing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Compulsive_redosing)**
- **[Increased libido](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_libido)**
- **[Delirium](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delirium)** & **[Confusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Confusion)** - This effect typically only occurs with overly high doses, and is associated with temperature dysregulation and overheating, particularly when 4-FA is taken in crowded, physically strenuous environments that leaves the user unable to cool off, rest, or rehydrate adequately.
- **[Ego inflation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ego_inflation)**
- **[Time distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Time_distortion)** - This can be described as the experience of time speeding up and passing much quicker than it usually would when sober.
- **[Wakefulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness)** ### Transpersonal effects
 
- - **[Unity and interconnectedness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Unity_and_interconnectedness)** - Experiences of unity, oneness, and interconnectedness are sometimes reported with 4-FA. This component most consistently manifests itself at higher doses during the empathogenic phase, within large crowds at raves and musical events in the form of "becoming one with the crowd." Music is said to intensify this effect as well consistently. ### After effects
 
- The effects which occur during the [offset](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Offset) of a [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) experience generally feel negative and uncomfortable in comparison to the effects which occurred during its [peak](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Peak) . This is often referred to as a "comedown" and occurs because of [neurotransmitter](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurotransmitter) depletion. Its effects commonly include: 
- **[Anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety)**
- **[Brain zaps](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Brain_zaps)**
- **[Headaches](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Headaches)**
- **[Cognitive fatigue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_fatigue)**
- **[Depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depression)**
- **[Sleep paralysis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sleep_paralysis)** - Some users report a higher incidence of experiencing sleep paralysis after consuming 4-FA, usually only at higher doses.
- **[Irritability](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Irritability)**
- **[Motivation suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motivation_suppression)**
- **[Thought deceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_deceleration)**
- **[Thought disorganization](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_disorganization)**
- **[Suicidal ideation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Suicidal_ideation)** - This effect is typically only reported when 4-FA is misused by either taking it too frequently, with excessive doses, and/or compulsively.
- **[Wakefulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness)**

## Toxicity and harm potential

The toxicity and long-term effects of recreational 4-FA use have only scarcely been studied because 4-FA has very little history of human usage. Anecdotal evidence, as well as several case reports, suggest there is a small to moderate individual health risk associated with the use of 4-FA. Among these, it appears there is an especially a high risk for acute cardiovascular toxicity. Some people in the Netherlands, only using a moderate dose, have died due to cardiac arrest or suffered severe brain damage due to a stroke. The mechanism of this acute toxicity is not yet known, but it seems as though the stroke starts off as an intense headache or even a migraine attack, that slowly worsens.

The [LD50](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LD50) (mouse; i.p.) of 4-FA is 46 mg/kg. 4-FA does not cause long-lasting depletion of brain [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) unlike [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) or 4-FA 's analogs [4-CA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Para-Chloroamphetamine) and [4-BA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Para-Bromoamphetamine) .

It is also worth noting that 4-FA is particularly caustic in comparison to other compounds and can, therefore, cause chemical burns within the nasal passage and throat if it is [insufflated](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Insufflated) . This method of administration is discouraged.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this substance.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

As with other [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) , the chronic use of 4-FA can be considered moderately addictive with a high potential for abuse and is capable of causing psychological dependence among certain users. When addiction has developed, cravings and [withdrawal effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Withdrawal_effects) may occur if a person suddenly stops their usage.

Tolerance to many of the effects of 4-FA develops with prolonged and repeated use. This results in users having to administer increasingly large doses to achieve the same effects. After that, it takes about 3 - 7 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 1 - 2 weeks to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). This is how long it takes to reduce the tolerance for the stimulating effects. Tolerance for the [entactogenic effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Empathy,_love,_and_sociability_enhancement) may take a longer period to reduce. 4-FA presents cross-tolerance with all [dopaminergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) , meaning that after the consumption of 4-FA all [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) will have a reduced effect.

### Psychosis

4-FA, like other stimulants, can result in a stimulant psychosis that may present with a variety of symptoms (e.g., [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/External_hallucinations) , or [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) ). A review on treatment for amphetamine, [dextroamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) , and [methamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) abuse-induced psychosis states that about 5–15% of users fail to recover completely. The same review asserts that, based upon at least one trial, [antipsychotic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antipsychotic) medications effectively resolve the symptoms of acute amphetamine psychosis.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **Alcohol** - Drinking alcohol on stimulants is considered risky because it reduces the sedative effects of the alcohol that the body uses to gauge drunkenness. This often leads to excessive drinking with greatly reduced inhibitions, increasing the risk of liver damage and increased dehydration. The effects of stimulants will also allow one to drink past a point where they might normally pass out, increasing the risk. If you do decide to do this then you should set a limit of how much you will drink each hour and stick to it, bearing in mind that you will feel the alcohol and the stimulant less.
- **GHB** / **GBL** - Stimulants increase respiration rate allowing a higher dose of sedatives. If the stimulant wears off first then the depressant effects of the GHB/GBL may overcome the user and cause respiratory arrest.
- **Opioids** - Stimulants increase respiration rate allowing a higher dose of opiates. If the stimulant wears off first then the opiate may overcome the patient and cause respiratory arrest.
- **Cocaine** - The rewarding effects of cocaine are mediated by DAT inhibition, and an increase of exocytosis of dopamine through the cell membrane. Amphetamine reverses the direction of DAT and the direction vesicular transports within the cell by a pH mediated mechanism of displacement, thus excludes the regular mechanism of dopamine release through means of exocytosis because the effects Na+/K+ ATPase are inhibited. You will find cardiac effects with the combination of cocaine and amphetamine due to a SERT mediated mechanism from the subsequent activation of 5-HT2B, which is an effect of serotonin-related valvulopathy. Amphetamines generally cause hypertension in models of abuse, and this combination can increase the chances of syncope due to turbulent blood flow during valve operation. The rewarding mechanisms of cocaine are reversed by administration of amphetamine.
- **Cannabis** - Stimulants increase [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) levels and the risk of [thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops) and [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) which can lead to negative experiences.
- **Caffeine** - This combination of stimulants is generally considered unnecessary and may increase strain on the heart, as well as potentially causing anxiety and physical discomfort.
- **Tramadol** - Tramadol and stimulants both increase the risk of seizures.
- **DXM** - Both substances raise heart rate, in extreme cases, panic attacks caused by these substances have led to more serious heart issues.
- **Ketamine** - Combining amphetamine and ketamine may result in psychoses that resemble schizophrenia, but not worse than the psychoses produced by either substance alone, but this is debatable. This is due to amphetamines ability to attenuated the disruption of working memory caused by ketamine. Amphetamine alone may result in grandiosity, paranoia, or somatic delusions with little to no effect on negative symptoms. Ketamine, however, will result in thought disorders, disruption of executive functioning, and delusions due to a modification of conception. These mechanisms are due to an increase of dopaminergic activity in the mesolimbic pathway caused by amphetamine due to its pharmacology effecting dopamine, and due to a disruption of dopaminergic functioning in the mesocortical pathways via NMDA antagonism effects of ketamine. Combining the two, you may expect mainly thought disorder along with positive symptoms.
- **PCP** - Increases risk of tachycardia, hypertension, and manic states.
- **Methoxetamine** - Increases risk of tachycardia, hypertension, and manic states.
- **Psychedelics** (e.g. ***[LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) , [mescaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mescaline) , [psilocybin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocybin)*** ) - Increases risk of [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , and [thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops) . 
- **25x-NBOMe** - Amphetamines and NBOMes both provide considerable stimulation that when combined they can result in tachycardia, hypertension, vasoconstriction and, in extreme cases, heart failure. The anxiogenic and focusing effects of stimulants are also not good in combination with psychedelics as they can lead to unpleasant thought loops. NBOMes are known to cause seizures and stimulants can increase this risk.
- **2C-T-x** - Suspected of mild MAOI properties. May increase the risk of hypertensive crisis.
- **5-MeO-xxT** - Suspected of mild MAOI properties. May increase the risk of hypertensive crisis.
- **DOx**
- **aMT** - aMT has MAOI properties which may interact unfavorably with amphetamines.
- **MAOIs** - MAO-B inhibitors can increase the potency and duration of phenethylamines unpredictably. MAO-A inhibitors with amphetamine can lead to hypertensive crises.

*Source: https://thedrugclassroom.com/video/4-fluoroamphetamine-4-fa/*

4-Fluoroamphetamine is a substituted amphetamine that offers effects somewhere between those of amphetamine and MDMA. It’s been a member of the research chemical market since the late 2000s.

It has at times been a more popular research chemical because it does have a unique and potentially desirable effect profile.

Not enough is known about the drug to be sure about its safety level, particularly with chronic use.

---

4-Fluoroamphetamine = 4-FA; 4-FMP; PFA; Para-Fluoroamphetamine; Molly’s Mosquito

PubChem: 9986

Molecular formula: C9H12FN

Molecular weight: 153.2 g/mol

IUPAC: 1-(4-fluorophenyl)propan-2-amine

---

## Dose

#### Oral

Light: 25 – 50 mg

Common: 50 – 100 mg or 100 – 150 mg

Strong: 150+ mg

The common dose range depends on what effects you’re looking for. A lower amount (50 – 100 mg) is better for productivity, while a higher amount (100 – 150 mg) usually makes the drug more recreational.

---

## Timeline

#### Oral

Total: 4 – 7 hours (at least somewhat longer for the stimulation vs. entactogen activity)

Onset: 20 – 40 minutes

---

## Experience Reports

[Erowid](https://erowid.org/experiences/subs/exp_4Fluoroamphetamine.shtml)

---

## Effects

#### Positive

- Euphoria
- Mood improvement
- Music enhancement
- Increased talking
- Physical euphoria
- Disinhibition
- Increased empathy
- Increased sociability

#### Negative

- Bruxism
- Insomnia
- Appetite suppression
- Headache
- Anxiety
- Irritability
- Vasoconstriction
- Increased heart rate
- Increased blood pressure

It’s generally described as a cross between amphetamine and MDMA. The effects are cleaner and more entactogenic than amphetamine, but definitely not as entactogenic as MDMA.

The wakefulness is equivalent to or greater than MDMA, as is the case with some of the pro-social effects. Users don’t report the stimulation to be very forced or uncomfortable in most cases.

As was already mentioned, the effects are dose-dependent. It’ll be primarily like amphetamine under 100 mg and a bit more MDMA-like over 100 mg.

Users tend to report a calm mindset with the drug and the chance of anxiety or agitation appears lower than with amphetamine. It’s often very pro-social with common or strong doses. An MDMA-like floatiness may be present.

The effects often have a wave-like nature, meaning there can be short periods where it feels like you’re much closer to sober. 4-FA has a smooth onset period and typically doesn’t produce a negative comedown or strong negative day-after effects.

#### Duration

If you’re taking a more recreational amount, the main effects will last 4-5 hours and be followed by more amphetamine-like stimulation for a few more hours.

#### Productivity

It’s not going to be particularly useful as a productive stimulant when over 100 mg is used. Around 50 to 75 mg is reportedly useful as a productivity aid, similarly to common amounts of amphetamine. Also, it may be productive once the core entactogenic-like effects have worn off with higher doses.

#### Survey

A 2015 survey of 249 people in the Netherlands gives some idea of the typical effects and how 4-FA is used. Most people reported taking it in festivals, dance parties, and clubs. They primarily obtained it through friends or online shops.

77.1% used the drug because of its specific effects, not because of its legal status. Most participants first reported taking it around 2013.

Oral was the most common route of administration (92.8%). 100 – 150 mg was the most common dose range, though close to 20% used over 150 mg.

Participants said it lasted either 4 to 6 hours or 6 to 8 hours.

The actual effect scores were between those for MDMA and amphetamine.

Compared to amphetamine

- Less irritability
- Greater talkative and pro-social effects
- Lower “craving” score
- Similar for alertness and stimulation
- Greater euphoria and “connectedness to others”
- Greater “changes in sensory perception.”

Compared to MDMA

- Lower intensity, confusion, and dizziness
- Lower “craving”
- Lower euphoria and “connectedness to others”
- Lower “changes in sensory perception.”

## Chemistry & Pharmacology

#### Chemistry

4-FA is a substituted amphetamine. It has a fluorine added to the core amphetamine structure.

The synthesis reportedly involves 4-fluoro-P2P (aka 4-fluoro-BMK).

#### Pharmacology

The drug functions as a monoamine releaser and reuptake inhibitor. Serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine are all elevated.

Its pharmacology (like the effects) is between that of MDMA and amphetamine. 4-FA has lower dopamine:serotonin and DAT:SERT ratios than amphetamine, but MDMA still has a greater effect on serotonin.

- DAT (IC50) 
- 4 uM
- SERT (IC50) 
- 20 uM
- NET (IC50) 
- 0.4 uM
- Dopamine release (ED50) 
- 200 nM
- Serotonin release (ED50) 
- 1000+ nM
- Norepinephrine release (ED50) 
- 50 nM

4-FA is 2x more potent than 4-chloroamphetamine as a dopamine reuptake inhibitor and 13x less potent as a serotonin reuptake inhibitor.

There appears to be some minor MAOI activity, though the potency is lower than 4-chloroamphetamine and 4-bromoamphetamine.

Corticosterone release is stimulated. 4-chloroamphetamine is also more potent in this regard. The release might not be connected to 4-FA’s serotonergic activity.

## History

#### Early 1940s

It was synthesized. There’s no record of the drug being tested for years.

#### 1960s

4-FA was studied in animals along with other para-substituted amphetamines.

#### 2003

The first detection in Europe appears to have been reported in Germany.

#### 2007 – 2008

This is when the drug’s current history truly begins. It began showing up throughout Europe, particularly in the Netherlands.

Initially it was detected as a result of sales originating with organized crime groups involved with amphetamine. They were using 4-fluoro-P2P to create an alternative drug.

#### 2007 – 2013

While the substance was initially misrepresented as amphetamine and MDMA, that changed over time. The Netherlands reported an increase in intentionally purchased 4-FA after 2009.

More seizures in the rest of Europe were reported beginning around 2009. There were multiple cases of it appearing in “ecstasy” tablets in Switzerland during that year. It was considered a fairly popular NPS in Switzerland relative to other drugs in that market.

At least 12 European countries detected the drug by 2010 through forensic cases and consumer drug testing.

By 2013, it was more common for the drug to be intentionally purchased than misrepresented in the Netherlands. It was among the top four detected NPS in samples submitted to Dutch drug testing facilities. The others were 2C-B, methoxetamine, and 5-APB/6-APB.

A study of 3,335 last-month partygoers in the Netherlands revealed its use rate was nearly the same as ketamine and GHB.

Data from the Netherlands was similar to reports out of Spain, which also said 4-FA and 2C-B were among the top NPS.

#### 2009 – 2011

15 forensic cases were reported in eastern Denmark. Most consisted of drugged driving, though there was one rape and one death of a known drug addict. The death was from polydrug use.

The rape involved a young woman who reported drinking ethanol and using cocaine. No cocaine was detected, only amphetamine and 4-FA.

#### 2013 – 2015

Usage stats between countries have varied. They presumably trended down overall during this period. In Italy, it wasn’t a commonly seized NPS between 2013 and 2015. The seizure rate was similar to 2-FMA and 5-MeO-MiPT. Other NPS like 3-MMC, MDPV, and 4-MEC were higher on the list.

#### 2016

16% of acute toxic effects reported to first aid stations at large-scale events in the Netherlands were attributed to 4-FA. This stat increased significantly from prior years.

- 2009 to 2011 – No toxic effects reported.
- 2012 – Under 1%
- 2013 – Under 1%
- 2014 – 2%
- 2015 – 11%

---

## Legal Status

#### United States (as of June 2017)

Federally unscheduled.

State schedules: Arizona, Florida, Louisiana, and Virginia.

#### Controlled (list may not be complete)

Brazil, Canada (due to amphetamine analog status), China, France, Germany, Hungary, Israel, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Slovakia, Serbia, and the UK.

## Safety

We don’t have enough information about 4-FA to tell how safe it’ll be in the long-term, especially with heavy chronic use. For this reason, it should be used infrequently at common doses and without combinations.

#### Lethal dose

This isn’t clear for humans, but we do have some animal data.

- Mouse 
- 46 mg/kg IP (potential human equivalent of 3.7 mg/kg)
- Mouse (male) 
- 150 mg/kg oral (potential human equivalent of 12.2 mg/kg)
- Mouse (female) 
- 25 mg/kg oral (potential human equivalent of 2.0 mg/kg)

Evidence suggests 2.0 mg/kg and 3.7 mg/kg aren’t accurate. It could potentially be somewhere between 3.7 and 12.2 mg/kg.

#### Neurotoxicity

Animal studies suggest it has a relatively low potential for neurotoxicity. Even when serotonin depletion is seen, it’s short-lasting and isn’t indicative of damage.

One report in rats showed no signs of neurotoxicity 16 hours after an injection. Another report showed no decline in serotonin or 5-HIAA concentrations at 10 ug/kg. There was a temporary decline at 100 ug/kg.

The research suggests neurotoxicity isn’t as much of a concern as it would be for the bromo and chloro substitutions.

#### Frequency

It’s wise to avoid using the drug daily or near daily when taking light or low-common doses. When taking over 100 mg, it’s best to at least wait a month between uses, preferably a few months out of an abundance of caution.

#### Non-overdose cases

Case 1

- DUI leading to blood and urine sample
- The driver had dilated pupils
- Serum: 0.35 ug/ml

Case 2

- DUI
- Driver was believed to be under the influence of a psychostimulant given his restlessness and tremor.
- He claimed to have taken “speed.”
- Serum: 0.475 ug/ml

#### Overdoses

**Case 1 – 2014**

- 18-year-old male
- 5 hours after taking the drug he reported nausea, vomiting, shortness of breath, and chest tightness. 
- He had used a “new street drug.”
- Two days prior he had received naltrexone and he was currently on fluoxetine and trazodone.
- Presented with an initial HR of 103 and temperature of 36.5°C (97.7°F)
- The symptoms worsened. He became very diaphoretic and hypoxic.
- Intubation and sedation followed.
- Testing revealed pulmonary edema and left ventricular hypokinesia.
- After he became hypotensive, dobutamine and epinephrine were administered.
- A 38.5°C (101.3°F) temperature occurred. 
- This followed the administration of dopamine, dobutamine, milrinone, and furosemide.
- Cardiac symptoms improved by Day 3, but he wasn’t released for two weeks. 
- He was given lisinopril and spironolactone daily after the incident.
- This group of symptoms was suggestive of acute cardiomyopathy triggered by catecholamine mechanisms or small vessel myocardial ischemia.
- A proposed diagnosis of reverse takotsubo syndrome was given.
- Question 
- Did the drugs administered during his stay contribute to the problems given they could also lead to takotsubo syndrome?
- Concentrations (hours after administration) 
- Urine: 64 ug/mL
- Serum: 0.118 ug/mL

**Case 2 – 2015 (Laskowski, 2015 and Poklis, 2016)**

- 27-year-old male
- Found agitated and lying on the street
- Alleged to have used 200 mg of 4-FA powder
- He presented to the ED four hours later
- PCP was present, but at a low concentration.
- Agitation, tachycardia, and hyperreflexia were noted upon presentation.
- He had hyperpyrexia of 41.4°C (106.5°F). 
- This was addressed with ice water submersion and ICU admission.
- Given 28 mg of midazolam in total
- Ice water submersion 
- Actively cooled for 22 min
- No shivering present
- Brought him to 99.3°F (37.4°C)

- Two caps of Molly’s Mosquito (she believed it was “synthetic ecstasy)
- 110 mg of methylphenidate intranasal
- 800 mg of modafinil oral
- She initially felt euphoric, but then she developed headache, vomiting, nausea, lightheadedness, and diaphoresis.
- Only anxiety was reported by the time she reached the ED.
- Initial HR of 110 – 124 and 36.5°C (97.7°F) temperature
- Anxiety and tachycardia persisted during her time in the hospital. 
- Treated with benzodiazepines, which was effective.
- Cardiomyopathy consistent with amphetamine/stimulant overdose appeared to be present.

4-Fluoroamphetamine (4-FA; 4-FMP; PAL-303; "Flux"), also known as para-fluoroamphetamine (PFA), is a psychoactive research chemical of the phenethylamine and substituted amphetamine chemical classes. It produces stimulant and entactogenic effects. As a recreational drug, 4-FA is sometimes sold along with related compounds such as 2-fluoroamphetamine and 4-fluoromethamphetamine.

## Usage

4-FA was popular in the Netherlands where it was predominantly used for its specific effects (77% of users) rather than its legal status (18%). 4-FA has become illegal since May 2017. Since the ban usage has decreased a lot. Accurate statistics of usage are not available until 2020, but submitted samples to get tested were counted. In 2016 1.100 (10%) of samples tested for DIMS were 4-FA samples, in 2024 less than 50 4-FA samples were submitted. In 2020 0,3% of Dutch adults used 4-FA in the previous year, in 2024 this was just 0,1%.

### Effects

The subjective effects of 4-fluoroamphetamine include euphoria which some find similar to the effects of MDMA and amphetamine, increased energy (stimulation), mood elevation, feelings of warmth and empathy, excessive talking, bruxism, and suppressed appetite (anorexic). The general course of effects involves primarily empathogenic effects for the first few hours, which fades out as increased stimulation develops over the next several hours. 
The dopamine reuptake inhibition produced by 4-FA is stronger than that of either 4-CA or 4-IA. 4-FA also produces less hyperthermia than similar compounds such as PMA, 4-MTA and 4-methylamphetamine.
4-FA has been described as producing a very mild "psychedelic" state, intermediate between that of amphetamine and MDMA. It is unclear whether this is related to induction of monoamine release or serotonin 5-HT2A receptor agonism.
Common acute side effects are nausea, headaches, increased heart rate and insomnia.

## Chemistry

4-FA reacts with reagent testing to give a semi-unique array of colors which can be used to aid its identification.

## Pharmacology

4-Fluoroamphetamine is a releasing agent and reuptake inhibitor of dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine. The respective EC50 values are 200 nM, 730 nM, and 37 nM, while the IC50 values are 770 nM, 6800 nM, and 420 nM.
The drug shows some affinity for the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor (Ki = 11,300 nM) and serotonin 5-HT2C receptor (Ki = 7,800 nM), similar to that of MDMA in the case of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor (Ki = 5,900 nM), but far below the affinity of structurally related classical serotonergic psychedelics like 2C-B. It has also been shown to act as a very low-potency serotonin 5-HT2B receptor partial agonist (EC50Tooltip half-maximal effective concentration = 14,400 nM; EmaxTooltip maximal efficacy = 58%).
4-Fluoroamphetamine has been found to be a weak monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) inhibitor, with an IC50Tooltip half-maximal inhibitory concentration of 16,000 nM. For comparison, the IC50Tooltip half-maximal inhibitory concentration of amphetamine for MAO-A inhibition was 11,000 nM.
Regarding the metabolic fate of 4-FA, the C-F bond at the 4-position on the phenyl ring likely resists deactivation in the liver by cytochrome P450 oxidase.

### Neurotoxicity

4-FA does not cause long-lasting depletion of brain serotonin, unlike its analogs 4-CA and 4-BA. This is thought to "reflect the inability of the fluoro-compound to be metabolized in the same way as the other haloamphetamines."
Neurotoxicity does not increase down the series of para-halogenated amphetamine derivatives, even though serotonin releasing potency does follow this trend. For example, 4-iodoamphetamine is less toxic than is 4-chloroamphetamine. Hence, this property is not related to serotonin releasing potency as such, since PAL-287 was reported to be not at all neurotoxic even though it is a powerful 5-HT releasing agent. It is unclear where 4-methylamphetamine fits in on the neurotoxicity scale. The extensive serotonergic neurotoxicity of 4-chloroamphetamine (and its brominated derivative), and the increased serotonergic toxicity of 4-methylamphetamine suggest that para-substitution seems to increase overall serotonergic (neuro)toxicity, compared to amphetamine. Exceptions include 4-MTA, a para-substituted, non-neurotoxic amphetamine.

### Toxicology

The LD50 (mouse; i.p.) of 4-FA is 46 mg/kg.
Fluoroamphetamine (isomer not determined) in a capsule mixed with 25C-NBOMe was associated with three deaths in Melbourne in 2017.

## Legal status

As of October 2015, 4-FA is a controlled substance in China. 4-FA is banned in the Czech Republic. As of 25 May 2017 4-FA is a controlled substance in the Netherlands. 4-FA is also controlled in Australia, Belgium, UK, Germany, Israel, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Chile, Brazil, Canada, Croatia, Sweden, New Zealand and France.
4-FA is a controlled substance as of 27 August 2014 in South Korea.
In the United States, on June 3, 2025 the DEA announced by federal register its intent to place 4-Fluoroamphetamine into Schedule I status with public comments closing on July 3, 2025.

### Finland

Scheduled in the "government decree on narcotic substances, preparations and plants" and is therefore illegal.
