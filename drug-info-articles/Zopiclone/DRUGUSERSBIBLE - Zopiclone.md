## Subjective Experience

Over the years I have occasionally noticed Internet references to a group of
psychoactives called z-drugs. These are generally considered to be zopiclone,
eszopiclone, zaleplon and zolpidem (notice the z in each), which emerged in the
1980s and 1990s and are (or were) generally prescribed for insomnia.

The most well known is zopiclone, which was first introduced by Rhône-Poulenc in

1986. It was scheduled in the US in 2005.

In testing this I am hoping for a little more than simple sedation. Erowid classifies it
as a hypnotic and a sleep aid, so with luck it will tend to the former. In the UK it
seems to be prescribed as both 3.75mg and 7.5mg tablets, with my own supply being
the higher of the two.

From reading social media it appears that there is a chance of blacking out if I overdo
the dose, and on this basis I did consider targeting the lower end of the common
range. However, I was assured by the NHS website, which stated that “The usual
dose is to take a 7.5mg tablet just before you go to bed”. I will go with the 7.5mg.

Because I wish to document and experience the psychoactivity and not simply induce
sleep, timing is an issue, particularly as I don’t wish to wipe an entire day either. I
eventually decide to pop the pill at 6.30 in the evening.

```
T+0:00 I open the blister pack and swallow one blue pill with a glass of water.
```
```
T+0.30 I am starting to feel slightly hazy, but as I often do at this time I decide
to go for a short swim, which should hopefully prevent too much drowsiness.
```
```
T+1:30 On return I sit at my desk and feel nicely chilled and relaxed. I am
definitely affected but not in a euphoric sense; more sedated with a slight haze
and a minor but definite hypnotic vibe. It isn’t at all unpleasant but naturally I
am now hoping for more action.
```
```
Drinking some fizzy water I do notice a slightly metallic taste in my mouth, a
tendency I had read about in a number of third party accounts.
```
```
T+2:00 I remain in a quasi dream-like state, maybe a little physically clumsy
and possibly betraying my condition to others in the house (as I have just been
asked if I have been drinking). As normal conversation appears to be tricky I
retreat back to my office and watch a couple of videos. I am comfortable with
my slight inebriation and I am able to function, despite the headiness and
perhaps a hint of disorientation.
```
```
T+2.30 I’m not groggy and I don’t feel impaired, but I’m a tad dazed and not
quite with it in my usual way. Neither am I struggling to stay awake, although
I do look forward to my head-on-the-pillow moment in half an hour or so.
```
```
T+3.00 I’ve not slept well recently, so the night’s sleep will make for an
interesting comparison. I make my way to bed at 9:30pm, three hours after
ingestion of the zopiclone.
```
The night’s sleep was a good one, with only a couple of minor disturbances. In the
morning I felt a little foggy but generally well.

Overall, at this dose, I found fairly mild sedating and hypnotic effects, which were
not overwhelming but which eventually and perhaps not surprisingly supported a
decent sleep.

Regarding a comparison with benzodiazepines the differences were minimal. On the
basis of this single experiment zopiclone subjectively created a more apparent
headspace and possibly slightly more lag the morning after. This does go with a huge
pinch of salt of course, given the limitations of my exposure.
