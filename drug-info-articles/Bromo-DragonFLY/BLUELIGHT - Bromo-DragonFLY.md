DISCLAIMER (NOTE FROM THE FUTURE - 2007):


THE DOSES REPORTED FOR THIS CHEMICAL ARE IN MANY CASES WILD GUESSES BECAUSE THEY WERE DOSED ON BLOTTER.  SUCH SMALL DOSES, ESPECIALLY ON BLOTTER, ARE VERY DIFFICULT TO MEASURE AND THUS THE REPORTS OF DOSAGES BELOW SHOULD BE TAKEN WITH A GRAIN OF SALT, OR POSSIBLY A WHOLE BARREL.


ADDITIONALLY, A LOT OF THE DOSES AND EXPERIENCES DISCUSSED BELOW ARE NOT EVEN VERIFIED TO BE BROMO-DFLY (DOB-DFLY).  PLEASE BEAR WITH US WHILE WE ATTEMPT TO SORT THIS ALL OUT.


AND IN THE MEANTIME, PROCEED WITH EXTREME CAUTION.

*********************************


Does anyone have any information about this chemical? The research i did showed that it's a more potent analog of DOB, but am not really sure of anything beyond that (including dosing range).


Have any bluelighers aquired this chemical yet? it looks like it could be part of the "second wave" of research chems

I have been on the lookout for this compound myself, in the UK, no luck so far,although I gather its been going around in the US.


It is an extremely potent serotonergic psychedelic, like the DOx series, but it lasts for several days.


The dosage is measured in the microgram range.


Thats about all I know on it, that, and I wish I had a gram or two, would be a lifetime supply![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

It lasts pretty much the same length of time as the corresponding DOx compound at the equivalent dose (200-250ug of bromo-dragonfly equating to 1.5-2mg for DOB). You'd only get days if you tried taking 1.5-2mg of the bromo-dragonfly

^ What, the IUPAC name or the one that normally gets used?


The non-IUPAC is 8-bromo-4-(2-aminopropyl)benzodifuran. The IUPAC name is a nightmare of brackets and numbers!

Oh no! ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif) 


They're all outside the definition of controlled phenethylamine derivatives because of the ring closure to form the two furan groups - what a shame!!

Analog, no doubt in my mind. I think I've even seen the creator of that chemical refer to it as a "complexly substitued phenethylamine"

From last summers crackdown on internet RC vendors, The Ryan Haight Bill and recent editions of Micrograms, it seems as if the DEA considers all research chemicals in the tryptamine and phenethylamine families to be analogs of already existing illegal drugs.  Regardless of whether or not this is scientifically sound.  And it doesn't sound as if anyone charged is fighting it.

From what I've seen of the way the US analogue law works, I'd bet that they could turn something like fructose into an analogue with the help of their twisted 'pet' chemists


> "bromobenzo[1,2-b;4,5-b']" I don't even understand that... what the hell does a semicolon in the middle of a multi-cyclo notation mean
> 		
> Click to expand...


the 1,2-b and 4,5-b indicate which carbon atoms are common to both the benzene ring and the attached furan rings. The semicolon indicates that it refers to two separate furan rings.

Like I said, the IUPAC name leaves no margin for doubt as to the structure, but does very little in terms of allowing the reader to get an immediate idea of the shape of the molecule in question; once you get 2 or more rings involved, it starts to look like an explosion in an alphabetti spaghetti factory! The IUPAC name for something with multiple rings, some of them being heterocyclic (eg buprenorphine or ibogaine) isn't woth thinking about unless your sending an article into something like J. Org Chem, or a drug patent application...

Here's a link to somewhat of a trip report regarding bromo-dragonfly blotter, which I believe is started to trickle out in certain areas...

I thought that the bromo-dragonfly compounds were extremely hard to synthesize. I actually thought that they are harder to make than LSD?

Even if they are harder to synth, it's a lot easier and cheaper to get their precursors than LSD's.

The synthesis reactions may be a little more involved/more of them, as compared with LSD, but it has 2 (poss even 3) things definitely going for it.


1. You're not limited to a very narrow range of precursors like LSD (have to start with ergot alkaloids if it's to be synthed in commercial amounts)


2. You don't have to have a fuck-off sized chromatography column, filled with a shitload of zeolite, to separate the reaction products.


3. No specialized storage conditions (unlike that delicate little flower, LSD) as it doesn't isomerize to an inactive product just because you got it a bit warm.


As it's active at doses not much more than LSD, I think that you'll see loads of it circulating in the next few years. I mean, can you see organized criminals letting something like this pass them by?

Well, organized crime never really picked up on high-potency opioids, which are certainly not more difficult to make but would be more profitable to sell. Seems organized crime just isn't into synthetic chemistry.

Well dob takes over two hours to kick in - about double the time that LSD takes to warp the users brain. I wonder if brdf kicks in any faster than dob, this could save some unintentional od's. Dob often got portrayed by the media as some sort of bunk drug that was used to dupe xtc users. Let us hope that brdf does not get dismissed as easily. I would like to see the synthesis of this compound come to light since I only know what hest has written about it in one of his dreams on another board. As quite often happens when one follows a literature procedure, when conditions are less than perfect, yields can become hopelessly impeded in certain cases.

From the people i've talked to who have tried this drug, my understanding is that it takes fairly long to kick in. One friend told me that one shouldn't expect to be full-out tripping until +5:00. 


There's also a good chance of a trip report appearing on the subject sometime in the next week. I'll keep you guys updated.

any idea on the dose/intensity curve?  like how much more potent 500ug (2-4 blotters, depending on blotter potency, and you know people will eat that much without a 2nd thought) would be compared to 250ug?


i think i might've had some of this stuff, because i've had "acid" that definately wasnt LSD, and felt more like a phenthylamine-type experience, with its euphoric body-buzz and carpet-esque visuals (in the way that 2cb visuals are sorta like a carpet on top of reality)

I wonder about that "sell-it-with-the-wrong-label-thing". And I am not sure if it really happens that often. Okay...people know Acid and not the most RCs, but a lot of people have also huge respect and don't eat acid like X or other drugs. Acid is (at least where I live) the worst selling product from all drugs. It is cheap and easily available, so there is no need to sell something as acid, because it is not the stuff people looking for. 

If a drug is as good as the dragonflies are supposed to be, it will be sold as dragonfly. Only "cheap and drugs that suck" might be sold as something more "valuable" but not the already (expensive) valuable ones as other valuable ones. So I m not afraid of the bromo-flies and dragonflies coming in, cause I think they will mostlikely be sold as what they are.  At least I would (at the moment) more likely wish to have them, not acid.

Due to it's very recent appearance, I'd say it's more likely that what you had was DOB or DOI, as you can get an active dose of them onto a blotter easily as well.


From what I can find, it seems that the dragonflies have a very similar toxicological profile to the DOx compounds, but due to their higher affinity for the receptor involved (5HT2a) are less toxic* . By this I mean that say 2mg of DOB and 2mg of bromo-dragonfly will have the same level of toxicity in the body, but 2mg of bromo-dragonfly will be anything up to 10x the trip strength.


If this does become a trend, I hope that the DOM analogue makes an appearance, as DOM is definitely the one of best of the whole DOx series


*  -  Because of the structure, it may turn out to be a bit iffy in the genetics dept. as I think the benzodifuran nucleus is the right shape/electronic configuration to interact with the DNA chain (not too bad, but acts as an intercalator - forms hydrogen bonds and sits inside the DNA chain)


Will post a bit more when I find out more

So you are saying that it may be a mutagen? Other mutagens include formaldehyde and cigarette smoke to name a few. The way you said that made it sound a bit freaky though. It put me off a bit to be honest.

Not a mutagen, just something that slows translation of DNA into mRNA. This tends to effect rapidly multiplying cells most (erythromycin is, I think, an example of the same sort of effect).


I'm just thinking out loud with this one - saw the structure of benzodifuran and a little bell went off in my head saying "looks a bit like some compound known to interact with DNA" (most of them are antibiotics)

i think i may have had a brdgnfly blotter recently. Hearts was the name of the print it was sold as, it was thick but tiny hits, too small to be 5-meo hits, they were bitter, but not terrible. And the trip was still slightly lingering at 24-30 hours later. I may be wrong, but ive done it on multiple occasions and have been amazed by the effects, but annoyed by duration

^^

Really... did you find that taking more hits increased the duration significantly, or were even smaller doses a 2 day ride?


I'm also curious how long it takes to kick in and what dose should expect to produce a light/medium/strong trip.

i got a very funky "bitter lemon" or artificial adrenaline type of flavor in the back of my mouth on DOB. I never had anything like this on LSD. And I tried LSD quite a few times when I was younger.

with one hit it lasts about 20-24 hours, with two, it was still lingering at 30 hours, it took about 3 hours before i even felt the slightest high, after hour two tho, there was some nasuea, but not anywhere near the nasuea reported with 5-meo AMT. at 5 hours i was tripping face.

Basically you're just talking about the same time frame as DOB, just that bromodragonfly requires a lower dose to get the full psychedelic effect

This all seems to be a lot of wild speculation so far.. a few people have had stuff that was on blotters that doesn't appear to be acid. I see no reason why it should be likely to be any kind of dragonfly, as opposed to DOx, alpha-O, or plain old LSD or whatever... yes, yes I'm sure you're going to say "but it was just so different to LSD". Set and setting, people. If there's one thing we could all learn more from Shulgin it's that drugs can give a wide variety of effects across and within subjects at different times.

I'm a little confused... FnB, can you clear this up for me?


In your article in ADD on the 'flys, you said that both the the saturated and fully aromatic furan rings were dragonflys (image attached). I thought the saturated version was the regular fly, and the aromatic was the dragonfly... or is the regular fly the one with just one furan ring?


Also, when people say "bromo-dragonfly", are we talking about the 2C or 3C version here (phenethylamine or amphetamine), and if the point above holds, are we talking about fully aromatic, half aromatic or fully saturated?


Is there a paper where Nichols talks about the nomenclature?

its my understanding that the "dragon" part of it implies a methyl group at the alpha carbon.  so you've got 2cb-fly for the difuran analogue of 2cb, and bromodragonfly for the difuran analogue of dob


edit - whoops, all i did at first was glance, i didnt even notice the double bonds, which arent present in 2cb-fly.  time to start studying again!

I thought that there could be DOB-fly as well as 2C-B-fly... and the dragon opart refered to the fully aromatic rings. That would seem more sensible, keeping the DOx and 2Cx for refering to the amp/PEA part.


Which is why I'm confused when FnB refers to the "dragonfly" and "fully aromatic dragonfly" in his paper...

The "FLY" name was inspired by the two dihydrofuran rings that extend oppositely from the sides of the benzene ring. When they are aromatized (furan rings) they are planar with the benzene ring and the code name is "DRAGONFLY" and they are listed as DFLY derivatives

SWIM found bromo-dragonfly to be energetic, colorful, and long-lived.  Though lacking in the narrative qualities of LSD or psilocin, the experience had a volitional character which SWIM found absolutely delightful.


Good stuff, I hear - and SWIM tends to be a snob about these things.

Well, i know i promised a few people a trip report on the subject, but i just don't think it's going to happen. I'll give a brief overview about it though. The dose was a single hit of blotter soaked in bromo dragonfly (And yes, i am confident in the source). If the mods think this is complete enough for a trip report, don't hesistate to move it to the forum. I'm unsure at this point however.


1:00 - Not much happens up until this point, pupil dialation is noted, as well as a dramatic amphetamine-like increase in enegry. There's a feeling of looseness in the arms and legs as well.


3:00 - Here's where things start to get intresting. Visuals start (trails, etc), and the body buzz greatly intensifies. Bromo dragonfly has an amphetamine like charcter, and an excess of nervious enegry accompanied the trip. Bromo dragonfly also has a definate euphoric quality to it. A definate wave-like quality has started to show itself with this drug, in that it quickly shifts from intense to beign.


5:00 - Things are slowly growing more and more intense. Lots of muscle clenching (Not limited to the jaw). The standard psychedelic "mindfuck" starts to set it around this point.


7:00 - 8:00 - The peak is somewhere in this range, and it gets pretty disorienting (A single hit was a full +++ trip). The amphetamine charcter starts to disapate at around this point.


10:00 - Things are pretty much plateauing, if not slightly diminished.


12:00 - This is where things start to get bad. I get an attack of intense GI pain, which does not subside. Out of despiration, i take a large dose (5mg) of estazolam in an attempt to reduce it.


From that point forward, i don't really feel i can give an accurate description of what the trip is like, as the benzo negates a lot of the "tripped out" feelings. However, historically i've been unable to sleep on psychedelics of any sort, and i wasn't able to sleep until 26:00 after injestion, if that gives any indicator of the duration.


So, what do i think of it, and would i do it again? It's definately an intresting trip, there's a fairly strong and controlable introspective element, and there's an almost amphetamine like euphoria to it. However, the duration and gastrointesinal pains that i went through brought down the trip, giving it the potential to turn quite dark if it had to.


I don't regret doing it, but won't be touching it again anytime soon.

It seems to me that there was a bit of change between Nichols' first naming of these compounds and the more recent accepted names.  When reading some references, I got really confused by the use of "bromo" (as in bromo-fly) to indicate not only a 4-bromo substitution, but also alpha-methylation.

In total, it lasted closer to 26 hours for SWIM.


SWIM spent the final two hours of the trip recovering in an isolation tank, and found it to assist wonderfully in assisting re-entry to baseline.


As for the duration of the hike, SWIM is fond of walking around, taking frequent pit stops to do yoga, roll spliffs, converse with friends, eat food, drink water, dance around, recite poetry, and much else besides.  SWIM would call it camping except there probably wouldn't be much sleep involved. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

I had a chance to buy some and never did, but my good friend got two doses and took both of them.  He was tripping for over a day and said the visuals were very intense at times, but very different from acid.

While bluedolphin already pointed this out, the doses contained on blotter are most likely significantly smaller than the 1mg dose taken in the report you linked to gloggawogga.


However, all of this is merely my personal suspicion, and there's no way to verify the bromodragonfly content on a blotter stamp. I can personally promise that my experience with it was no where near as intense at that.

^yup 

this is not the kind of substance to be handled without care. problem being that there are always people not doing that.. im surprised 2c-t-7 (and that more isolated case with 2c-t-21) was the only one up until now. but this one seems very liable for leading to accidents considering the dose. any ideas about its LD50?

Considering the dosage is in the LSD range, I think 'accidents' will happen with this compound. From what I've seen, it's only been offered as a solution in alcohol, which is good because if it came as the salt in powder form, it'd be easy to absorb a dose through breathing dust etc, and I'd lay money on some idiot trying to eyeball a 200ug dose.


That said, I think the main worry is that someone will produce it as the salt and that people with more money than sense will get ahold of it. If it remains as a soln. there's much less chance of an accident happening

Has an accurate dose range been established? I've heard anywhere from 100ug to 1mg.


Would it be physiologically safe to start at a 1mg dose? SWIM is traditionally a hardhead with psychedelics.

Would you be happy if you found out that the hard-headedness didn't go as far as the benzodifurans (dragonflies)?


**ALWAYS** start low when trying a substance for the first time. You can always take more if it falls below what you expected, but the reverse is impossible

Your so right! 


Even the way its offered now, perhapes  10mg diluted into ethanol vials!

There's gona be that peson who is gona think if one drop is nice then 5 is better! What is the LD for Dfly? It ant like LSD; you can take up to 12mg's of LSD and come back. Depending on your mind Hehee


Or lets say it hits you/some after one hour or so, so with some the rule of thumb is, take more> Surprise! 


what about Dfly showing up in blotters, jezz im from the old school we would take 2 or 3 hits, what then! 


So hopefully each and every one of us can spead the word; that if your told something is LSD, it mite not be LSD in todays world! Dont let your young impatience minds misleed your judgment!

My only worry (besides the bit about eyeballing the dose) is if bromo-dragonfly has the vasoconstrictor (or muscle tension) properties that DOB has. If so, anybody taking doses around a milligram might find themselves in a world of pain (see PIHKAL entry for DOB) from muscles cramping etc.

I think that compounds like this should come in ampoules of say, 100ug (or other suitable low-medium dose, depending on potency). With a package insert explaining the dosage, effects, etc.


That's how mescaline and LSD used to come when they were still legal. Are the dragonflies legal in UK, does anyone know?


Also, compounds like the DOx series and the dragonflies should be relatively expensive (compared to the 2C's etc).... this will keep all but the very curious away, as many stoners are simply looking for a cheap thrill.

thats quite obvious, i was thinking about rough 'ideas', inferred from other more or less structurally related compounds. that is, assuming such 'related' LD50's would be relevant (im far from being a chemist or toxicologist, i have no idea)

The benzodifurans are different enough from the 2,5-dimethoxy compounds for there to be no 'substantially similar' compounds in terms of toxicology, so you couldn't really even go in for an educated guess.


Example: Ergotamine is a lysergic acid amide with a couple of amino acids making up the amide group. LSD is the same, except the amide group is derived from a simple amine. While 10mg (100 doses) of LSD wouldn't be 'fun' for most people, it is easily survivable (in the physical sense) whereas 10mg of ergotamine will cause such severe vasoconstriction that you can lose whole limbs. Dimethoxyphenyl to benzodifuranyl is a similar sort of change.


Long story made short - nobody has a clue.

They may still be legal in the UK now but they won't be for long if people sell them in 100ug ampules. And like someone said, there's still gonna be someone that wants to do 5 or more doses at once.

That link mentions 'FLY' and '2C-FLY' as having been assayed in a drug discrimination paradigm.  Not having the cited study in hand, anyone know if those were found to substitute for LSD in trained rats (indicating it is psychedelic)?


It would be interesting as (I am assuming) 'fly' and 2C-fly' are the dihydrofuran analogues of 2,5-DMA and 2C-H respectively...which are either not very active (the former) or not even active at all (the latter).  The difuran rings make them bulky enough to survive Mr MAO.  It would be neat to try the 'fly' and 'dragonfly' analogues of things like 2C-F, 2C-O-2 (2C-MEM), TMPEA (2C-TMA), and others that are either not very active or not active at all to see if they then become active.

MGS:


Quite a while ago, I got to try a dose of bromo-fly (the non-aromatic analogue of DOB), and it was at 500ug. At that dose  got mild DOB like effects - the active full dose is somewhere around 800-1000ug; this effectively means that the flies are only marginally more potent than the 2,5-dimethoxy equivalents (about 2x the potency - makes 2C-B fly dose of 10mg seem about right). Making the furan rings aromatic drastically increases the potency - from people I've talked to who have tried bromo-dragonfly, they've said that a full active dose is about 200ug - so for a rule of thumb, it would appear that the dragonflies areabout 10x the potency of their dimethoxy counterparts

thanx f&B! Maybe I will raise up SWIMS dose to 100 or 150µg for the first time.


Voltech: strange question "normaly" depends on the lab or the further supplier. Since you will get only 1mg it will be dissolved in a liquid (Ethanol high probably) and in a vial of PP. But how it comes out of the lab is maybe in powder form or also in dissolved in liquid. Anyway...both forms exist.

SWIM is going to take doses of 100ug with him to the voov experience in Germany. He is going to find experienced psychonauts who have an interest in this substance and will report back to this forum when the event is over!

SWIM is also planning to combine 100ug with a dose of 110mg of mdma. He isn't sure though if that is such a good idea... What do you guys think? Does MDMA have that same constricting effect on the cardiovascular system as the DOx compounds? What could SWIM do in an emergency in order to dilate his vessels again? SWIM is quiet anxious about the whole thing and will have to think through it for a while...

Mmmm, you've got a point there bluedolphin... Any experience with that sort of stuff? Think I might feel bad. Thing is, I rarely do MDMA, twice in the last year.

You might be right though, it could be a bad idea. Maybe I should do the BDFL alone and consider dosing on the MDMA once it starts to wear off. I might dose myself with FMP and MDMA when that happens, it's supposed to be a great combo! And once that kicks in I can still go for some 2C-B or 2CT7 for my tripping needs. In case I have any needs left after the BDFL is done with me. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) I might just go for some ketamine or oium or whatever yummy stuff I can find on the voov.

Btw, I love that Willy Wonka flick, I own the DVD. I luv it.

As far as I've discovered DOB is the only DOx compound with vasoconstrictor properties. Until more people have reported back about effects/side effects of dragonfly compounds I don't think it's a good idea to be combining it with anything.


As gloggawogga pointed out, if you have the R isomer you should half the dose (ie 200ug of racaemic compound = 100ug of R isomer), although that might not be an identical experience - see some of Shulgin's reports comparing racaemate with optical isomers

My ten dollars says when that Bromo-Dragonfly is worn off the first thing on your mind will be "Sleep!" ... not "Let's eat some MDMA!"


![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif) 


Well, reason I said you might not want to mix MDMA with Br-Dragonfly your first time with dragonfly is the same reason I'd not suggest candyflipping your first time with LSD. Except I imagine Br-Dragonfly will be a lot longer and probably not mix as well with MDMA as LSD.


And for the record the only time I've ever flipped out and really gone crazy (not in a good way at all) from too much drugs was LSD + MDMA.


I won't be among the first people to try bromo-dragonfly, but if I was I would start low (75ug) and not mix it with anything else.

Well I have to say that I'm interested in trying this sometime, but I really think that Bromo-Dragonfly could be very dangerous in the wrong hands. There are so many people out there that will try to make a buck off this and sell it as LSD. I can see the reports now..."dangerous form of LSD circulating." I think it is just a matter of time before someone ingests way too much of this stuff.  Be safe and careful people!

I wouldn't mix it with anything until more is known about this new compound.


So few people have tried it. Who knows.... maybe 1 in 50 people have a real bad reaction to it. Maybe some people are super-sensitive to it. 


Personally, when Br-DFLY crosses my path, I'll try it- at 50ug in a safe space, with no other drugs. And if I like it, I'll go higher.


Don't fancy being the first statistic or the "silly c**t who took too much of that weird new experimental drug and thought he could eat an aeroplane."

Too right Boywonder,


I do think that all drugs should be available to those who can handle them BUT....


I also know for a fact that there is an organisation who have produced loads of Br-DFLY blotters (don't know what the logo on 'em is at this point) and while I think that blotters are a good medium for dosing potent drugs *in and of themselves*, there are people out there who, through ignorance or greed, will sell them as acid. People could get hurt and down the pan goes an entire new line of drugs.


It's partly our own irresponsibility that make drugs illegal in the first place and now's a good time to learn to enjoy them, but to respect them as well. When we can be responsible, we have just cause not to accept external governance.

Neo1

Your right!


I want to say;

The aura surrounding LSD blotters, these last 30+ years, has to change!

We have all taken more then one hit, and there's really no LD50 to be concerned about, with LSD. 


Now that they're certain "chemicals" being placed onto blotters, nowadays. We have to tell everyone, we come across; in our daily lifes not to assume that Blotter always equals LSD, when you come across it nowadays.


It also comes down to folks;  "assuming and being impatience", that attitude sends people to the ER!


Even if someone received something form a trusted internet supplier i.e. May think it's 2C-E but you got 5-meo-amt instead unbeknownst < has to dose very low just incase it was mislabeled. 


I just wanted to put this out here; onto everyones conciseness. Maybe most BL'ers know to be careful; but there are newbees reading this too!

 spread the word!

I strongly advise against doing that. People at a rave are not going to be prepared for a drug like this. They won't have researched it, and you don't know what adverse reactions people might have. With the effects coming on so slowly, and lasting 24 hours, people will think they didn't get enough and redose. We don't need another haight ashbury DOM disaster.

Listen to glog's advice. ANY trials with a new, unknown drug should be carried out in conditions that are easy to control, for the sake of the person taking the drug. This basically means a quiet room, but with access to music etc if wanted, where the temp is comfortable and there are going to ne no unexpected events that can spiral badly out of control. Being at a rave, with 100's of other people all intent on burning the candle at both ends is possibly the worst place to take a drug that is mostly unknown in nature/effects etc. If something goes wrong for the person under the influence, the situation can go from unpleasant to potentially life threatening so fast it'll make your head spin.


Example: The person has a panic attack, runs off and cannot be found by those who are looking after him/her. That has lots of potential bad outcomes. If it's something like a rare anaphylactic reaction, it can mean the difference between an embarrassing night in a hospital ward and an eternity in the hospital morgue

cr00k please think about these things you are saying.  You're planning on dosing yourself and persons unknown with the most potent, longest-lasting psychedelic ever created (edit - it was correctly pointed out to me that ibogaine is longer-lasting).  At a party. With other drugs.  And wondering how many doses of this unknown and untested drug you should take.


Does this really sound rational to you?


I don't want you, or anyone else, to get hurt.  And I don't want bromo-dragonfly to create its first fatalities at some mega-rave in Germany, get popularized, demonized, and criminalized because of someone's lack of common sense, either.


Your plan is really, really stupid.  This isn't an attack - I'm not saying that you are.  But really.  It is a recipe for disaster.

1) I would never give the drug to anyone who has not informed himself about it.

2) There are going to be fast acting benzodiazepines around.

3) There are going to be lots (!) of experienced trippers around.

4) I am most positive that there are going to be medics around who will most likely have antipsychotics as well.

5) Someone has to try it. It's never gonna sound "rational" to ingest a new RC... Will it?

6) I am not going to mix it with anything else.

7) Didn't someone mention it would in his opinion be best fitted for an outdoor event?

And like those medics are going to know all about any possible contraindications between bromo-dragonfly and other drugs. They're going to know all about it...uh hum.

Yeah but a rave is not a wise setting to experiment with an unresearched chemical like this one.

Some one did, and someone else reported a loss of contact with reality. And even the person who said it would be good for an outdoor event wrote: "For the record, SWIM took it in an apartment, with a sober assistant, and ready access to a phone."

> Source? To me this sounds like a pharmacological impossibility. Plain bullshit. I have strong doubts that either an antipsychotic like Thorazine, or a benzodiazepine like Temazepam or Lorazepam could possibly have any effects like that. If they had, I would most likely know about it. Then again, I have not studied pharmacology and have been surprised before by weird chemical interactions, so thanks for the warning. I'm still going to ignore it unless I will hear more reliable information on this topic.
> 		
> Click to expand...
Well you catched me on the wrong feet actually! I thought I am the last one knew this, since some people around me told it me as "everybody knows it". I got this information from two (independent) persons who used DOB regularily both more then 10 times in their lives. Both told me about this interaction (in form of increasing the psychedelic effect) which they used to alter the quality of the trip and also to "save" material. But as I said I don't remember the name of the specific benzo they both told me. This is definitely NOT a reliable information source as you stated already and since I personally have **no** experience with this substance at all I can't judge it. When it IS just a legend, then it is not a net gossip but more likely some false cause effect or the guys are just schizo Acidheads (but actually I believed them since they not out of reality). Erowid does not has it written in the sideeffects, just alc, Amphetamines,...

When seeking for any "proof" for this statement I found just **[THIS Guy](http://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=37704)** saying the following:


> Because of the long duration, you'll likely get annoyed by the side effects so taking some benzodiazepines could be a good way to pass the time. Benzos such as Clonazepam and Nitrazepam also seem to have a synergicstic effect with DOB, increasing the psychedelic aspects of the experience (which is weird); they also relax you a great deal and take the edge of in general, but it is unlikely that you'll be able to fully 'come down' while DOB is in your system no matter how many you take.

> Click to expand...


well...I don't know but I wouldn't say it is completely bullshit unless some experienced DOB users (who did the combination) tell me that.

Yep - what's needed is for somebody to take a small (relative to dose for full effects) dose and then record things like pulse rate and BP in response to a series of challenges before being happy that it's *relatively* safe.


For example; before taking a combined dose of amphetamine & IAP (to try and reproduce the MDA effect - serotonin **and** dopamine release), I tried taking a dose that amounted to 10 percent that of the dose of IAP I intended to take, then administering a very small (2.5mg) of amphetamine and recording heart rate and BP, then comparing it with what 2.5mg of amphetamine did on its own. Once that appeared safe, I repeated again , only using 20mg of amphet instead of 2.5mg.


It was only after I was convinced that IAP had no dangerous interactions with amphetamine that I tried the intended 30mg of IAP and 30mg of amphetamine. People know diddly squat about a lot of these RC, so you have to tread very carefully in this unknown territory

you can defend anything with reason crook. one can very reasonable say the outside world does not exist and there is no absolute argument against it (sceptics), one can prove by reason alone there are 7 planets in the universe, that is must be so and cannot be any other way (Hegel),.. the list is endless. futher, reason itself does not convince people, asking for reasonable arguments against you is useless. you know how a new scientific paradigm like einsteins universe is accepted? the scientists using to the old one die out, never accepting the new theory, always trying to incorporate the evidence proving the new theory in their own old paradigm. The younger, furthering the new theories (in search of establishing their own name) take over the educational institutions. the textbooks are then rewritten just like after a revolution historybooks are rewritten, justifying what is now.  

accept that what you plan to do is has nothing to do with reason at all, it is in its very core an unsupported 'preference', as glogga said. then you build reason around that to make yourself believe otherwise.

Now, how *wise* is it to go against the ideas of all these knowledgeable people on this board? their combined experience **far** exceeds your own (thats why you post your 'question' here).  and dont tell me science uses reason, and look how far they got. science 's base is experience; empirical observation and evidence. reason follows.

btw putting yourself in danger is one thing, putting others in danger is unacceptable by any means


edit: if you want reason anyway; how hard is it to see that an evironment where you are much more in control of is better then an environment where almost everything is out of your control. scientific experiments are conducted in a controlled enviroment, where the variables can be adjusted by the conductor

All good points people, and mostly rational ones at that.


If Crook wants to try this new substance at this event, that's his personal choice. But I would draw the line at offering it around willy-nilly to anyone and everyone..... that's irresponsible. It's the kind of substance that should be restricted to those who *seek* it, rather than *offered* to anyone.


Crook might feel ok with the uncertainty of an event such as Voov. Maybe he likes the possibility of danger, like racing-drivers do. But he is also correct in that medical care is probably closer there than it would be at home. Maybe he lives on a mountaintop or something. All I can say is that I hope you dose low to start, mate.


My reluctance to take such a substance as Br-DFLY at such an event would come from another angle. At an event such as this, I'd want to be taking something tried-and-tested so that I could have an amazing time.  If I were starting low, I might not get an effect suitable for the event. It might be too lacklustre or too overpowering. But beight a new compound, I wouldn't want to push the dosage there and then either ('cos hey folks, I want to be around next week so I can try the new superduper br-DFLY-MKII squared.)


I can see the temptation of trying something like DFLY at a massive event such as Voov, I used to feel the same way in my early days of LSD use. But 16 years of tripping in all kinds of ways has taught me that it's not the forseeable variables that are problematic, it's the *un*forseeable ones.


Be safe,

Neo

Totally agree with that. I assume crOOk has read enough to make his decision, so even if we find it too dangerous and risky we have to respect his choice. Many people would not understand why most of us take RC, but the thing is that we do because is our decision, because for us the benefits are greater than the risks. And I find that totally respectable. Individual freedom goes first, for me. 


That doesn't mean that giving B-DrFly is, in my opinion, unacceptable as it involves other people, so it's not their choice. I believe RC should not be offered, as Neo1 said, only those who seek them should try them. And this has nothing to do with elitism, it's only being responsible.

i believe crook was hinting that he may be meeting another bluelighter there who has an interest in bdf.if so,thats a bit different to handing it out willynilly.i have tried quite a few rc's at festivals,reason being there is plenty of things to do that are all aimed at people in a psychedelic state.as crook mentioned there are also people there specifically trained in dealing with bad trips,overheating etc.probably more people there trained in it than at a hospital.however i have never taken an rc for the first time at a place like that,i think its always best to take half a threshold dose at home the week before,just to check that your not going to have the screaming shits(my worst fear at a festival)or an allergic reaction.i would suggest doing just that to check that your reaction will be the one hoped for,before taking it at an event.as far as the dpt goes,i would advise smoking half or less than your normal dose,if you feel safe enough to.anymore could be potentiated by the bdf and make you trip twice as hard as intended.10mgs of nn'dmt was enough for me to breakthrough whilst on 80mgs mdma and 12mgs 4-ho mipt.normally it would be about 40mgs of nn'dmt to breakthrough.

have you tried asking your supplier what dose he reccomends crook?

Serpent:


Cr00k's desire to dose himself with said dragonfly is his choice entirely, regardless of how foolhardy we consider it, but don't go telling him about taking other drugs in smaller quantities in combination with it would be safe even if he reduces the dose. Did you see my post on how things can turn out totally different to how you expect. Taking a pill of 4-MTA and then a small dose of say meth or MDA would land you in an A&E (ER for US readers) dept with a hypertensive crisis and possible serotonin syndrome. We have no idea which metabolic enzymes this compound might inhibit; therefore no idea of what effects other drugs might have on the body. Taking it at an outdoor event is taking risks (but that's, in the final analysis, his choice), but taking other drugs on top in such an enviroment is akin to an unspoken death wish and should NEVER be encouraged. There's a protocol for such things, and for these compounds, I've tried to devise one that is fairly safe, but even then I'm taking risks

DOB can give some glowing experiences in the 200ug-500ug range (the latter already giving CEV,movement of objects),perceptual enhancement,stimulation etc..almost free of bothersome physicals.I would want to search out Bromodragonfly first at the 20-50ug levels,thats for sure.

The comparison DOB - MDA isnt accurate in my mind,DOB is way more psychedelic.


Some 13 years ago (my first psych. experiments),I did once a stupid thing and never again,taking an overdose (didn't weigh it correctly...) of such a potent compound.I completely lost consciousness and reality,something you do not expect from mind-expanding drugs and ended up as in hospital.Well,I survived and no,I did not have to amputate my legs as another rumour goes with DOB.There were serious physical effects like heavy convulsions,urinary retention to the point of very painful etc.


Psychological:Violent behaviour (well,not against people only things but sexually probably offensive),selfdestructive behaviour (feeling no pain like erowid describes).


It must have been 6-7 mg.That was quite a lesson,I really remember only traces and this disturbs me the most.

6-7mg of DOB - that's quite a hefty dose. Did you experience leg cramps etc (if you can remember)?


I think any vasoconstriction that is caused by DOB would be via the alpha-adrenergic system (a bit like ergotamine), but obviously nowhere near as severe. I know that the person who survived snorting 80mg+ was in a hell of a state for a long time, but I can't remember reading anything about ergotamine like symptoms. Because of that, I'd think that DOB has a ceiling to it's vasoconstrictor effects - enough to cause iscaemic pain, but not enough to cause necrosis. The weird thing is that DOI is relatively easy going on the body, by comparison (yet to get a report from a friend as to what DOC is like on the body, but Shulgin didn't give any hints of it being bad).


I'm hoping that bromo-dragonfly doesn't share the vasoconstrictor properties that DOB displays (for obvious reasons). As for initial dosing, I agree with hugo24 in that doses of 20-50ug (comparable with 200-500ug of DOB) would be a good place to start investigating. It's also a lot more enjoyable not to be totally whacked on a first dose of an unknown psychedelic

**f&b**


Leg cramps,no,at least not on the come up before losing consc.,after "waking up" I remember cold legs though.The few flashes I kept from the plateau is that the unbearable energy-pressure inside is making you try to release it with running around and banging whatever body part against the walls.


The cramping later on was more a whole body cramping,starting in the back-lots of valium hepled but only for short times.I was not told of being given vasodilators.


Now that you bring the Ergotamin comparison up,I recently had to take some against Headache as Dihydroergotamin  is not available anymore- this put me in some unpleasant state not unlike I remember on the DOB come up then,maybe my psyche suddenly remembered something.


Pleasant shivering and a frizzy feeling  is a property of even low doses of DOB (alpha stuff? like amphetamin).Maybe its only one isomer.


Reagrding DOI,i read a report of a 6mg experiment being hard but not a problem.


Maybe the dragonfly only has the psychedelic effects lowered to the 100ug range,meaning higher selectivity overall?

What exactly is the motivation for wanting to try bromdragonfly anyway?


[obviously I am speaking in comparison to the PEA/PIPA compounds]


I guess this is largely subjective question like why does anybody want to do anything. But if anybody has any meaningful answers that they'd like to share then i'd be interested in reading them.

I am going to try it soon for several reasons, including curiosity. One reason is that it has a very long duration of effects and I like long trips. Another reason is that I have not tried any of the DOx chemicals and this may be similar to DOB. And trying new things is exciting.


I think I will use 100ug or maybe 150ug for my first time.

"What exactly is the motivation for wanting to try bromdragonfly anyway?"


If this whole new difuranyl structure is changing the overall feeling of these compounds.


But frankly,I have my reservations about these amphetamine psychedelics as they have some serious side effects,even though I like long experiences (2C-P!!),but 20-30h is a bit too long as it interferes with sleeping routine (something I find important in my life).And the sleep after these amphetamines is,well,either isn't or is bad.Having said this,DOM is still one of my favourites!


Generally though,I found the corresponding 2C's much much more suitable and selectively pleasant psychedelic.


Why the hell is none making the 2C-Dragonfly's,CD,CE,CP,TFM etc?I mean possible doses at 0.5-5mg is a very good mileage,especially when providing a wonderful experience.

^ You'd think that RC vendors, motivated by that little human quirk known as avarice would have been working their little arses off securing a supply of 2C-B dragonfly (8-bromo-4(2-aminoethyl)benzodifuran), as 2C-B seems to be their 'holy grail' in terms of acceptance by the great unwashed masses (otherwise why did the 2C-B/BZP hybrid show itself a while ago?).


Shit, a 2C-B replacement that would be active at around 1mg, you'd think we'd be getting a flood of it turning up


On reading that back, it def looks like I got out of the wrong side of bed - not usually that cynical - oh well, some DOB should fix that!

 Because it's too costly and there's no sufficient market for these to sell enough to make back the money it costs to have them made.


I think that this chase for potency is making no sense anyhow. Just because a compound is more potent doesn't make it a better or more pleasant psychedelic. Tripping for 24 hours isn't such a great thing either. I haven't tried any of the ultra-potent, ultra-long compounds, and I'd choose 2C-D any day over them. Where's the point with these compounds?


In my opinion it would serve the world better if the phenethyl/phenylisopropyl moiety could be modified so that the compounds wouldn't fall under the UK (and other places) catch-all laws any more.

I suppose another benefit would be if these flies are truly gems then the potency will be good for those who don't like to shell out a large amount of cash to purchase RC's. If you could dose 1mg for something like 2cb dragonfly imagine how long that gram would last ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


I'm really looking forward to 2cb dragon/fly, I too have wondered why no one has synthed it yet. Something like that given it has even remotely similar effects would be gone extremely fast given 2C-B's popularity.

To be honest, if someone does synth them then put then on the RC market, I hope they make the cost quite high - that'll hopefully keep some of the arseholes who take multiple doses on a daily basis from killing themselves and focusing unwarrented attention upon the new compounds. If they were to say start selling bromo-dragonfly at say $1000 a gram ($0.20/dose) you can bet that it wouldn't take long until hospital admissions citing the drug would start cropping up.


And we all know where that leads...

I've got a report from someone I used to chat with when the Hive was up & running about 6-(2-aminopropyl)-2,3-dihydrobenzofuran - it's a hybrid of MDA & IAP (see below)


![59655MDA-IAP_hybrid.JPG](https://www.bluelight.org/community/proxy.php?image=http%3A%2F%2Fi1.bluelight.ru%2Fg%2F500%2F59655MDA-IAP_hybrid.JPG&hash=06dc0e9097c317cd23709772d4bcd559)
 


He said that at 200mg it was very rewarding in a strange MDA sort of way (said he'd def do it again). Reports I've read from someone else I know who tasted the 5-(2-aminopropyl)-2,3-dihydrobenzofuran (swap position of oxygen in furan ring) said it was a bit of a disappointment. From the work Nichols did on SAR of MDA like agents (it included IAP and MMAI), it appears that to get decent effects on dopamine release, you need an oxygen atom (or other lone pair containing atom eg nitrogen) meta-orientated to the isopropyl side chain.


Actually, IAP with a dopaminergic agent (like amphetamine) included with it produces a very MDA like experience. The friend who gave me the info about the 5-(2-aminopropyl)-2,3-dihydrobenzofuran also synthed some N-methyl IAP (called it IMP - liked the name!), with a view to getting a more dopaminergic response from it - I'll see if he's happy to make the notes public


Thanks to InfiniteBITCH for pointing out the error

I don't think the MD-(methyl)-aminorex derivative will be worthwhile. It has been made in the original study of aminorex. They only tested it as an anorectic; potency dropped 25-fold compared to aminorex. That doesn't bode well for any useful activity.

Found this, supposedly from one of the next big shulgin books,


From the working draft of an upcoming book by Shulgin, "Psychedelic Index", Transform Press, 2004


![attachment.php](https://www.bluelight.org/community/proxy.php?image=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bluelight.ru%2Fvb%2Fattachment.php%3Fs%3D%26postid%3D3256785&hash=7ac2b202ca6db5b4fe562b052348233f)


Names:


2C-B-FLY

1-(8-Bromo-2,3,6,7-tetrahydrobenzo[1,2-b:4,5-b']difuran-4-yl)-2-aminoethane


Registry Numbers:


CARN

HCL salt 178557-21-6


Natural sources:


Not known in nature


Synthesis:


From hydroquinone (with 1-chloro-2-bromoethane) to 1,4-bis(2-chloroethoxy)benzene (with Br2) to 1,2-bis(2-chloroethoxy)-2,5-dibromobenzene (with BuLi) to 2,3,6,7-tetrahydrobenzo[1,2-b:4,5-b']difuran (with dichloromethyl methyl ether) to 4-formyl-2,3,6,7-tetrahydrobenzo[1,2-b:4,5-b']difuran (with CH3NO2) to 4-(2-nitro-1-ethylene)-2,3,6,7-tetrahydrobenzo[1,2-b:4,5-b']difuran (with LAH) to 1-(2,3,6,7-Tetrahydrobenzo[1,2-b:4,5-b']difuran-4-yl)-2-aminoethane (with Br2) to 2C-B-FLY (Monte, et al., 1996).


History:


The "FLY" name was inspired by the two dihydrofuran rings that extend oppositely from the sides of the benzene ring. When they are aromatized (furan rings) they are planar with the benzene ring and the code name is "DRAGONFLY" and they are listed as DFLY derivatives.


Physical properties:


C12 H14 Br N O2

HCl salt m.p. >310 (EtOH, EtOAc) (Monte, et al. 1996).


Pharmacology:


The five "FLY" compounds (2C-FLY, 2C-B-FLY, FLY, B-FLY and DOM-FLY) were assayed in a drug discrimination paradigm with LSD-trained rats, and in interactions with various serotonin receptors. (Monte, et al., 1996).

2C-B-FLY is active in man at an oral dose of 10 milligrams (Shulgin, 2003a)


Legal Status:


2C-B-FLY is not listed in any law.

> Click to expand...


No, pyrans are six membered oxygen heterocyclics (5 carbons & an oxygen. THC has a pyran ring at its heart), the flies/dragonflies are benzodi**furans** (5 membered oxygen heterocyclics). If you look at it in a certain way, it can be seen how one of the furan rings is a direct replacement for the pyrrole part of indole (both oxygen and nitrogen have the lone pairs required for receptor binding), the oxygen replacing the nitrogen.


I don't think that they'd be teratogenic (but that's just an educated guess), but they may act as intercalators and slow translation of DNA to mRNA, but then again, there are plenty of drugs that do that (eg some phenothiazines etc); nowt too serious as long as you don't have an impaired immune system

> 		
> Click to expand...


It's BZP, but with the benzene ring carrying the same substitution pattern as 2C-B/DOB (compound is 1-(4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxybenzyl)piperazine dihydrochloride. From what I've heard, it's worth its weight in shit! ie not too good to say the least. NZ has some of the strictest, non analogue act type drug laws going with respect to psychedelics. 2C-B is def. covered by them

alright.. i'll bite... what does 2C-B-FLY have to do with Bromo-Dragonfly? it's not like if you find 2C-B-FLY, you can roll to your lab real quick and make it into the fully aromatic dragonfly... so then, why not a thread for 2C-B-FLY?

As discussed earlier, FnB's figure is in error - the molecule (b) is bromo-fly, or B-Fly. Molecule (c) is B-DFly (bromo-dragonfly).


2C-B-Fly would be the same as B-Fly, but without the methyl on the alpha carbon - the same is the difference between 2C-B and DOB.

Yep the label attached to b) is incorrect, it should read bromo-fly. This was before I discovered that the non-aromatic compound was the 'fly' and the aromatic compound was the 'dragonfly'. The factual data regarding receptor binding was correct, just got the nomenclature wrong

Sorry, ghettotastic, but I remain a little dubious about any blotter allegedy soaked in B-DFLY - no matter how confident you are of the source. I guess I'm not going to be totally satisfied until someone does a proper GC/MS workup, but for now, reputable vendors will do - ie not those slinging blotter.


Perhaps you could tell us the dosage that was put on the blotter you received?

 There's every reason to believe that it's long-term stable under the usual, proper conditions: room temperature, protected from light and moisture.

This thread would be a lot more useful if people could post their experiences, including duration and effects at a range of dosages.... rather than talking about availability and prices.


... Unless you've seen a particular sheet which is widely distributed and verified as bromo-dragonfly. But it shouldn't be a surprise to anyone that something active around 100ug and offered at more affordable prices might be misrepresented as LSD.


My advice would be to eat only one blotter your first time to see how you react. Even some legitimate LSD is being layed strong enough to overwhelm noobs.


My other hope is that LSD drops in price and increases in availability so that there will be much less motivation for people to lay DOI / DOB / 5-meo-AMT / DOC / Bromo-Dragonfly, etc.

I'm sorry, but we've all endured way too many years of alleged mescaline microdots and 5-meo-amt passed off as LSD to trust drug dealers, widely distributed or not. How would you "verify" a sheet as B-DFLY, rather than say DOx?


Online vendors are probabably marginally more reliable, but I still wouldn't be entirely certain that you'd get what has been represented.

I know that one source was supplying small quantities of B-DFLY in a solution of 40% ethanol - any ideas how this would effect stability? I remember that some people found that tryptamines like iprocin decayed very quickly in solution...

genaro:  you really cant turn *everything* into a fly/dragonfly because of the spots on the benzene ring that must be occupied to make it a fly/dfly.  as of right now, the only compounds that could be made such are the 2c- (including 2ct-) and do- (including aleph-) compounds, excluding the 2cg and ganesha (g-x) series, although 2cg and ganesha (g-x) series could be made into hemiflies/hemidragonflies.  *maybe* it'd be possible to have mdxa hemiflies/hemidragonflies too...

 In order to be a suitable candidate for a dragonfly analogue, the molecule MUST contain a 2,5-dimethoxy ring substitution pattern. As the formation of the benzodifuran structure also occupies the 3 & 6 positions (the other end of the furan ring's attachment to the benzene ring), that only leaves the 4 position for altering the ring substituent.


As tathra has pointed out, this means that there is no possible dragonfly analogue for any compound other than those carring the 2,4,5-trisubstituted ring - any further substitution means that only a hemi-dragonfly is possible, and then only if there are methoxy groups on the 2 & 5 position


For example - it would be possible to produce a hemi dragonfly of DMMDA (2,5-dimethoxy-3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine), but not of DMMDA-2 (2,3-dimethoxy-4,5-methylenedioxyamphetamine)

^^^


So what about 3,4,5- substituted PEAs - Genareo mentions mescaline. If the furan rings were closed up in the same way, then you'd have a structure like the DFLY, but with both oxygens on the "wings" pointing in the same direction... ie towards the methoxy group in mescaline.


Or the otherway around, starting from TMA-6 - giving the furan rings withe the oxygens pointing back towards the amine... 


These two wouldnt be dragonflies.. quick think of a snappy new name! ![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif)

I think a very good compound would be 2C-D-DF if it shares the properties of 2C-D on a higher level. It can't be made by Nichols' method and afaik hasn't been made yet.

You've still got a chip on your shoulder about the ALD-52 hydrolysis thread ([Heirarchy of LSD](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/showthread.php?postid=3049926#post3049926)), haven't you? Well lets see... first of all, learn to read, dear boy. In your enthusiasm to call me a chemistry simpleton you didn't read my post properly - I wasn't talking about MDMA, I was talking about DMMDA (see structures below)


![59655DMMDA_hemi_dragonfly.JPG](https://www.bluelight.org/community/proxy.php?image=http%3A%2F%2Fi1.bluelight.ru%2Fg%2F500%2F59655DMMDA_hemi_dragonfly.JPG&hash=2fc649697fc0814d0ef79ec96e80e055)


and as you can see, it is possible to get DMMDA to form a hemi-dragonfly structure, but not DMMDA-2 (because DMMDA contains the essential 2,5-dimethoxy substituents and is unsubstituted at pos 6.


Secondly, why would you want to make a hemi-dragonfly of MDMA (even if you could)? The dragonflies & hemi-dragonflies are very potent 5HT2a agonists, but MDMA has bog all activity at the 5HT2a receptor - it acts on the SERT and DAT systems, effectively putting them into reverse and causing an efflux of serotonin and dopamine.


As for the comment about daydreaming and making up things in chemistry, I do check what I write before commiting it for public scrutiny, ensuring that I've got the facts correct (or as near as dammit). When you do what you've done, and use incorrect facts to take a condecending approach in an attempt to belittle others, it just makes you look like a complete egotistical windbag. You were incorrect before, and incorrect again - next time, before going off half-cocked try taking a little time to think about what you've read and are about to write. That way you can learn a few things, rather than just ranting because your pride was hurt.


PS Had you been civil in your questioning, I wouldn't have made a point of highlighting all the bits you were incorrect about. Get over yourself - everybody is wrong at some point, but the people interested in the science, and not just inflating their ego learn from it and move on.


Give it a try sometime

If it wasn't aimed at me, then I apologize about the attitude. I simply looked at the first post before yours to mention methylenedioxy compounds, which happened to be mine. That, taken with the way that the hydrolysis arguement developed meant that I assumed that you were making comments about my post.


It helps if you quote what you are replying to at the top of the thread. Again, if I mistook the content of your post I apologize

Structurally somewhat related to the dragonflies is 9-(aminomethyl)-9,10-dihydroanthracene 

which is a potent 5-HT2A antagonist:

Ok, I'm gonna find out where the threshold dose lies. I have ingested 10ug at 6pm. I do not expect anything to happen. If I am right, I will get up early tomorrow and ingest 25ug. It might be a little to soon though for the second dose considering how slowly it is metabolized...

I will work my way up within the next two weeks. I plan to do 25, 50 and then maybe I know how much I am going to need for a full blown trip at the voov experience.

Ok well... I had 10ug and 4 hours later I actually felt some sort of tingling body high. Did not expect that. Also my mood is better than before and I am more alert. I proceeded to ingest another 40ug. Can't wait.

B-DFLY is active in man at about 100 micrograms i.m. administration. It is without oral activity at 10x this dosage. (Shulgin, 2003a).

I personally have my supply of bdfly in a solution with alcohol. For those who experimenting with similar material:

I strongly recommend NOT to inject alcoholic solutions. I actually don't know about the risks of that, but I would hesitate to do that.

100ug... inactive. ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)

I've never administered anything via IM or IV route, so I guess I just lost 90 Euros. Great fucking day.

Well, if it's not orally active.... try diluting it with 10 parts of H2O, and put that wine where the sun don't shine!  :D


Definitely evaporate off all the alcohol first before you try to inject.

Ok, I had 220ug orally today, this stuff is inactive via the oral route, at least at doses up to 220ug. :D


I might give smoking a try. I will definitely not IV it though, although I assume IV'ing ethanol would be safe, right?


Ok, well, 90 fucking euros down the drain.


I'm just glad about the DPT Freebase I finally got to try.

I've been laughing my fucking ass off for the whole night, DPT is definitely my favourite tryptamine. I've loved the HCl salt and I could get addicted to the Freebase. :D Seriously, it is awesome, ecstatic, as long as you go careful on the dosage...

I kind of think the dosage needs to be nearer the milligramme than down at a couple of hundred micrograms, which will make it pricey.

Well, I have ingested 220ug today, I can't really tell if there was any effect, since the DPT would be overshadowing it... I guess I will know if I can sleep tonight.

I need to go for 350ug next time. If that isn't really strong I might juts as well up it with another couple of hundred micrograms. I'm kinda disappointed since everyone claimed it to be active at a much lower dose... ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)

I was searching the net and found several (really a lot of them) medical injecting solution with mostrly higher amounts of ethanol beside the medication. So it IS POSSIBLE to inject alcohol, you just need to de-concentrate it a bit I recommmend a ratio 1:5 or 1:10. There shouldn't be any alcohol effects with that minimum amounts.


Sorry for making all nervous, it isn't that bad as I thought.

He meant the fully aromatized version, and he said that it's orally inactive up to 1 mg.  The activity he mentions at 100 mics is via injection (IM).


But you make a good point about the identity of the compound.  I don't know of any independent testing of the material being sold as DOB-DFLY (aka bromo-dfly, a name I don't like at all because it's too easily confused with 2C-B-dfly).


I'm glad this thing turned out to be anticlimactic.  It could have been a disaster.  Super long-lasting, slow-to-come-on, potent compounds are the last thing that should be out there getting passed around like candy at festivals.

**Plug It!**


As suggested above, one could try plugging this to see if it has activity via that route. Much easier than IVing it. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

Mmmmm... Mescaline...

Yeah, you might be right there, maybe I should try plugging it. Like I said though, it should be active in the higher mcg range, around 500mcg...

What do you guys suggest? Should I go for a large oral dose or decide for plugging it? I don't have very much time to do it, actually it doesn't fit into my schedule at all... Still, the curiosity is too big not to do it.


I've never plugged anything before, I'll need to do some research before I'll be ready. Is it possible that I will feel irritations in the anus? Has this ever been painful to anyone? I don't really feel like getting some kinda local rectal infection. Also, do you think my ass will hold 2 or 3 ml of liquid which I plan to apply with a syringe? The alcohol concentration would be less than 4% in that case. How deep should I go in there?

From what's been posted here, it sounds like oral dosing it just going to be a waste of compound. I would try plugging it.


I don't think the alcohol will cause any irritation at that low of a concentration.


I would get an oral syringe and dilute it to around 5ml. I've never had problems holding 5ml until it absorbs. Make sure you administer it all at once though and clamp down as you pull the syringe out so you don't lose any of it. If you have to reinsert the syringe a second time, it's easy to lose the first part of the liquid you already administered.


You can use a bit of water-based lube to make it a bit easier, but don't use anything greasy like Vaseline since it may hinder or slow the absorption. You don't need to get it very deep in there either, but you want to make sure you get it deep enough that it doesn't squirt out as you push the plunger. Push the plunger slowly to avoid it leaking out too. When using a 5ml oral syringe, I typically ease it in as far as I can (about 2.5 inches) push the plunger and clamp down as I pull out the syringe. Voilia! ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif) It's really no big deal once you've done it a few times. Just wash your hands and the syringe real well before and after and you don't have anything to worry about.


You squeemish folks just need to get over it. ![:p](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png) It's a great route for administering many phens that I've tried. Most are very potent via this route so it's great when trying to conserve precious material. 


Good luck. If you give it a run, make sure to post back how it goes. I'm interested to hear about this chem even though I probably won't ever touch it myself.

Thanks for the info! How long does it usually take till the chemical is absorbed? An hour? Less?

I only have standard 1ml and 2ml syringes at hand though, I'll only need one ml for 50ug. Can I just use that kind of syringe instead? It should be long enough, more than 3 inches actually.

How about pain receptors in there? Is it possible that it will burn like intranasal administration? I am kinda worried about that.

Thanks for the info!

I find that most things plugged hit much more rapidly that when administered orally. The time it takes would depend on many factors, primarily how quickly the specific compound is taken up into the bloodstream. With 2cd, alerts are felt within minutes and by the 15 minute mark, it starts to climb like a rocket. It and DPT both seem to peak around 45mins when plugged, but this chem could be quicker or longer. Hard to say. You are in unexplored territory here. Assuming it's active and 100% bioavailable when plugged, you should still be very safe at the 50mcg level since the suggested IV dose is 100mcg. I wouldn't go any higher than 50mcg the first time. 


You should be fine using the smaller syringes. I've always used a 5ml or 10ml syringe becuase DPT is hard to get into solution. When I've used 2cd, I used smaller amounts of liquid since it dissolves easily into water.


There is certainly the possibility of irritation. I get a little bit with 2cd for like 5mins, but it goes away quickly. Nothing like snorting it though. With that small of an amount of liquid, it will absorb pretty rapidly. The amount of chemical is really small with this one though so I doubt it will cause much if any irritation. More likely any irritation would be a result of the alcohol in the solution. That's why I would dilute it to a few mls if possible. 


Another reason to dilute it to a few mls is to get as much of the dose as possible too. The tip of the syringe (the 'deadspace') can hold a good bit of volume that won't be administered. Using a larger volume means you will get more of the drug. Since it's less concentrated there's less drug left in the tip of the syringe.

i would just like to point out that the suggested **IM** dose is 100ug, which should put the **IV** dose at ~50ug, perhaps even less.


recalling previous experiences of mine with various other substances, i believe IM and rectal doses are pretty close, so 50ug rectal might not be enough.  crook, if you get no effects, i suggest 2 more trials, of 75ug and 100ug before you give up completely.  of course, wait until tomorrow before you try again; for all we know, you'll start tripping balls in another 2-3 hours.  ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Yeah, i agree. No more Phethylamines for me today. I might go straight for 100ug with my next try. I wonder whether I will build up a tolerance or not with such a frequent intake of inactive doses... If I do, the outcome of the experiments should be treated with caution.


Btw, has anyone ever taken a bath on DPT? I might do that tonight. Should be lots of fun. Sorry, OT.

I agree with tathra. I wouldn't give up on it yet. It may still take a long time to come up on it rectally as well. If the comeup via IM route takes a while, I would expect rectal to take a while as well. You might be pleasantly surprised yet today.


If not, I agree in bumping the dose up a few more times before calling it quits with the rectal route. As I said, DPT takes quite a bit more when plugged, but it is still very effective once you get there. I would slowly increase it up to at least 200mcg or so before I gave up on plugging it.


I wouldn't bump it any more today though if I were you. I think it would be prudent to wait several more hours before you decide it's not going to have any effects. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

lol - crook i think you've just built up a tolerance..


I first tried 150ug orally and it worked, barely but it was there.


I took 600ug orally yesterday and i tripped, equal to about .. 2.something mg's of DOB but more visual.  I was writing a trip report but my computer crashed.

A usually reliable source has told me that 2mg orally caused a delirium-like state which lasted 2 days. It was a very rough time for the psychonaut as well as for his 'baby-sitter'.


Looking at the Ki, EC50 and Emax data from the Nichols publication I would also predict a VERY steep dose-response-curve:

(R)-Br-DFly: Ki = 0.31 nM; EC50 = 2.7 nM; Emax = 93%

DOB: Ki = 2.2 nM; EC50 = 72 nM; Emax = 79%


So at 8.7x its Ki (R)-Br-DFly causes a 46% response at the 5-HT2A receptor. DOB for comparison requires 32.7x its Ki to cause a 39.5% response. This makes a very steep dose-response-curve.


While a comparison of the Ki values would indicate that (R)-Br-DFly is 7.1x more potent than DOB, this is misleading, because the Ki says nothing about the ability to activate a receptor. Considering the much more relevant EC50 data, (R)-Br-DFly should be 26.7x as potent as DOB, and the racemate about 15x. This would fit to the 100mug i.m. active dose which would correspond to 1.5mg DOB.


Another drawback of Br-DFly is that it's affinity for the anxiogenic 5-HT2C receptor is 3x higher than for the psychedelic 5-HT2A receptor. DOB has about equal affinity for the two receptors. Unfortunately, there are no EC50 data for the 5-HT2C receptor available, but it's likely that Br-DFly has a much higher anxiogenic potential than DOB and other traditional psychedelics.


Br-DFly has a number of rather unfavourable properties which make it a third-class psychedelic and unsuitable for blotters: 


- very low and erratic oral bioavailability

- very steep dose-response-curve

- very long, delirium-like trip

- high anxiogenic potential

Excuse me, but what is this about? Is there anywhere that I can get some pharmacology for dummies of the SERT receptor. I cant make heads or tails out of this.


I did find this: [http://www.acnp.org/g4/GN401000039/Ch039.html](http://www.acnp.org/g4/GN401000039/Ch039.html) if anybody is interested.

@C6H6

Steep dose response curve? High anxiogenic potential? Doesn't sound very yummy to me at all. Especially considering that the trip might last more than a day...

Oh, and thanks for reminding me about the cross-tolerance thing. I actually didn't think about it. Stupid me. I'm not gonna do any other tryptamines or phenethylamines before my next Bromo-Dragonfly dose.


@Blowmonkey

Like I said, I'll have a break of at least a week before dosing again.


Btw, no effect of those 50ug that were applied rectally.

These are theoretical considerations which require experimental confirmation. But based on the theory I'm not too keen to be an early guinea pig.


Regarding the anxiogenic activity of 5-HT2C agonists: MK-212 is predominantly a 5-HT2C agonist as can be seen [here](http://www.gpcr.org/7tm/ligand/Organon/Tablig/LIG_C67250106.html). And here are some information demonstrating the anxiogenic activity of MK-212 in humans:

Not if he includes that data as part of the overall report. Tolerance and cross tolerance data are useful...but his presentation of trials may have been a little over the top without consideration for the overall effect of everything he was ingesting. 


The thing about the rave is dumb though...patience is truly a virtue when testing unknown waters. Just imagine the potential ill results of handing out chemicals with so little known about them to people, most of whom would probably have had little time to do their own personal research before ingestion. I mean, even if you figure out a "safe and enjoyable" dose, there are still so many other factors that remain unknown. Interactions with other chemicals/medications. Variability between users and their reactions to it. The potential side effects would probably be mostly unknown after only a few trials by a handful of people as well. So, there is a bunch of reasons why this would be not-so-good a time to start introducing this to "the masses", even if they are experienced with other psychedelics. It's best for now to have planned out experiences in order to build up info about this material first. First learn to fly, then shoot for the stars.

50ug was taken orally. no response, but it did take forever to get to sleep. any recommendations for dosage for someone who faints at the sight of a needle?. (why the fuck none of the trip reports mentioned that it was IM'ed i'll never know, unless people are full of shit when they report???)

From what I have read, although much of it is suspect, the dosage range for oral activity is guessed to be between 200-500ug. I think someone here on BL posted that a person who took 2mg was delerious for 2 days in a not-so-good way. So, I would continue to take the slow climb up the ladder if I were you. But so far, that is what information I have read on the internet.

Even though I have obtained some of this compound, and am rather a wuss when it comes to needles (I turn green and nearly pass out), I am quite happy that this substanced has turned out to be only active via IM at these super low doses. Even if the oral level is only around 1mg (still very low), this is enough to keep the dealers who may have been planning to start marketing this via blotter and thereby causing all manner of damage to the research chemical "scene" (which gets a bad enough rap as it is). I doubt putting this stuff on blotter will now be economically feasible for the drug dealers, plus they'd have to use larger hits if they did, which would make it much more difficult to pass off as LSD. 


I really don't want to see another incident like the whole DOM/STP thing. Poor Shulgin felt a lot of responsibilty for that, and I'm sure he would be equally upset if a similar situation happened with this compound.


And seriously "bad fortune"???? This is far from bad fortune, bad fortune is the couple who had DOB, but thought it was MDA and snorted an appropriate amount. Woman dead, man in coma for weeks. That's bad fortune, this is the type of thing one should expect from a new and untested substance.

I recently acquired 1 mg. of  Bromo-DFly suspended in a 40% ethanol solution to 500 microgram/ml.  After reading this thread, I'm a bit disappointed to find that the oral doses for this substance are comparatively much higher than some of the earlier reports I'd read had seemed to indicate- but only just a *little* disappointed.  I have no use for needles nor injecting anything into my body, have never plugged anything nor do I have much desire to ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

I'll try a small (100ug or so) IV dose soon, within the next few weeks. Some time when I won't have to drive or act normal for 48 hours. This stuff still sounds very promising to me.

It should be quite easy to measure out the proper amount to get 100 mics in ethanol, then let the ethanol evaporate, then dissolve the solids in distilled H2O (or whatever, I don't do needles, so I'm not positive that's what you would use, but you get the idea). I'd think it would take a couple hours max, probably much less than that.

One concern would be, 'How do the dosages of an IV versus and IM use differ?' since nobody has ever taken it IV. The other concern is, 'How smart is injecting some chemical which was made by lord knows whom, was diluted in at least two solvents by a vendor, sold over the internet, and evaporated off by you?' Do you trust the purity of the chemical and its solvents? Do you trust that the amount supposedly in the solution is exactly the amount you were told? Think carefully before you try this experiment. Eating some powder you bought off the internet is one thing, pumping it straight into your veins is a tad more risky.

Injecting some powder/rocks I bought in the ghetto from some shady person I've never met has never given me much worry.


I don't see what would be bad about injecting 0.08mL of ethanol. I've heard of plenty of people injecting pure liquor out of a liquor bottled, undiluted, and while it burns it isn't too bad. The fraction of a millilitre that the bromo-dragonfly is dissolved in should be painless.

Don't worry (I know these words will be misunderstood), you're liver is gonna take care of the ethanol and lots of other impurities. WHAT I'd be worried about is IM'ing that shit. Now that's a whole different story... Fuck that.

Without first taking a small dose by mouth to ensure that you don't have an adverse reaction to the compound, we're again in the realm of totally reckless behaviour that could end up with a coroner telling the press that this is the next menace our (ie society's) young people have to face.


I've tried to convey to people that they have to be very careful as this is untested territoy, but as soon as you've finished pointing out the dangers of one type of behaviour, somebody pops up with another.


I'd love to say "go ahead, do something stupid without being cautious and safe first; it'll serve as a warning to others", but it'd haunt me that *I'd* been so irresponsible.


EVERYBODY CONSIDERING USING A COMPOUND WITH A NON-EXISTANT TRACK RECORD IN HUMANS; look at how Shulgin went about the testing of DOT (Aleph-1) in PIHKAL as an example of safe proceedure when ingesting unknown compounds. I don't mean directly repeat his method, but notice the degree of safety built into his trials and adapt it for your situation (with things such as possible allergic reactions, unexpected physiological reactions possible interactions with other substances etc).


I can see this is why mods resign out of frustration

Well, it's good that you're here to warn people of the dangers. I appreciate it, as I'm sure most Bluelighters do, and I hope it never gets to the point where it becomes too frustrating for you to carry on moderating.


I think it's all about acceptance of certain realities, one of which is that some people are gonna do what they're gonna do, come hell or high-water, regardless of safety and/or responsibility,  and irrespective of any warnings that anyone might give them. The bottom-line is that they're going to do what they want to do, and there's really nothing anyone (absent themselves) can do to change that.


So my advice is to just accept it. Let them know the known and unknown dangers, then let them make their choices themselves. I may think some behaviors are stupid or irresponsible or immature or selfish, but I also accept the fact that everyone is different and that some people will behave in ways that I don't agree with, and that there's nothing I can do to stop it. You can't fight it, so why take that burden upon yourself?


I dunno. I just hope for the best and hope that no one hurts themselves nor anyone else with this stuff.

He says nothing of a small test dose beforehand (say 20ug by mouth) to ensure that he doesn't have an idiosyncratic reaction to it. If he does and he puts 100ug straight into his bloodstream, then any anaphylaxis will be almost immediate and has more likelyhood of being fatal. At least with a small test dose beforehand you reduce the speed and severity of any anaphylactic/hypersensitivity reaction (I know about this as I have a hypersensitivity/allergy to the penicillin group of drugs).


That's what I mean by 'common sense precautions'. You have to know about these sort of things if you are going to indulge in experimental human pharmacology. Shit, enough people die with drugs the have a proven track record nevermind ones with next to no animal, nevermind human, pharmacology.

well i agree that whilst all of the popular edible chemicals are relatively safe, no doubt there are exceptions. So, a 50ug might be more appropriate for a 'safety first' mentality. However the "idiot user" might be more inclined to think 'fuck it, i'll just inject 100ug and see what happens'. He might freak out and have a horrible trip. He might *think* he is gonna die, but the chances are he will actually still be safe.

Nobody has ever taken it IV. There is one report of IM use. The dose for IV may be much lower, he may be hypersensitive or allergic, or any number of other unpredictable factors. If you are not fearful for your life, bleeding edge RC's may not be your best choice. One ought treat them with the same healthy levels of fear and caution as for example, experimental jetcraft.

Does that mean I can view myself in the same light as people like Chuck Yeager? (pilot of the first supersonic aeroplane; Bell X-1).


I've got 'the right stuff' ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif) 


I def like that analogy!

It'll prove that it won't do things like cause a massive histamine release in you. If the oral dose causes any itchyness, I'd say an IV dose doesn't sound like a good idea at all. The benzodifuran nucleus is different enough from ring substitutions into a phenyl group to possibly have some unpredicted pharmacological effect in some people (like me with penicillins. Similar antibiotics are OK as long as they don't have the beta-lactam ring common to all the penicillins. It's the beta-lactam ring that is the cause of the immunological (allergy) reaction)

What good is a small oral dose to check for bad reactions going to do for a drug that doesn't really work orally? It may possibly help screen out allergic reactions, but not necessarily reactions to the drugs pharmacology. Have you had your sample of bromo-dragonfly analyzed by an independent chemist to insure there are no contaminants in either the drug or the solution it is in?


No offense but what exactly is your motivation here? 'I spent E35 on this and by God, I mean to trip!' or have you put more thought into it? What you are doing seems rather reckless.

Precisely that, to rule out a hypersensitivity response. Those sorts of response kill people every year, and as it's to check before administering IV, it's the sort of thing you need to know as a hypersensitivity/allergic response to an IV drug is going to occur very quickly (quick enough to have you dead in a couple of minutes if you're the unlucky one).

T+01:30, Bob Dylan waking me up.

T+02:00 Nope, no effects, or are there threshold effects?


Maybe I should drop another 250 at least. Fuck it, I just will.


EDIT: Looks like fastandbulbous (it was you, right?) was right about the steep dose response curve... 2mg=48h delirium, 1mg=threshhold? This is just an assumption, noone get me wrong here about that second dosage. 1mg might wreak psychedelic havoc on some individuals!

He, I have some 2C-B right here... :D


Anyway...

T+00:00 Oral administration of 400ug on an empty stomach after a night of sleep.


Back to sleep, extremely vivid dreams, lucid dreams without waking up, great dream memory...


T+01:30 Bob Dylan wakes me up, no effects yet. In retrospect maybe there were some threshold effects. Ingestion of another 250mics.


T+04:00 I feel awesome, strong body buzz, everything looks like it was gonna jump at me (in a positive way), glowing etc. My mind is really calm, no racing thoughts at all. Weird. Although thought patterns seem deeper and focused around biographical aspects. Had time to observe this while taking a hot bath. This felt awesome. Peaches, omg peaches. Peaches are so fucking good.


T+04:00 Definitely great stuff. The first 400ug should be peaking now. Lots of pleasant body feelings, higher muscle tension, my saliva is all tough and shit, really sticky, typical trippy feeling in my throat and stomach and everywhere, I love it. Visually it seems unexciting, but I am sure (!) this will change at a higher dose. It should have a lot of potential, everything looks much like 10-15mg of 2C-B. Let's wait till the other 250ug have taken their full effect in an hour or two... I think 1mg will be a good dose though for future trials.


Btw I still feel quiet calm, not too speedy at all. Pupils are dilated, not that anyone out on the street would notice though. Blood pressure seems normal, still don't have any batteries. ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)  Pulse doesn't seem significantly raised either.


T+08:00 Good stuff! 1mg should be just right. Only physical discomfort was some slight nausea... I only had fruit for the whole day... Everytime I burp I kinda feel like I could puke within the next couple of minutes or so. Never happened to me on any psychedelic before (well, besides shrooms, but that's another story). It's cool though, nothing that would make me feel really bad!

The whole point is that you don't test for a hypersensitivity/allergic reaction with an injected dose as that has the potential to kill you due to the very rapid onset of symptoms. The oral route is slow enough that any allergic reaction is slow and generally milder in onset and can be dealt with using antihistamines/steriods (for the mild reaction) or adrenaline in the rare case of a severe reaction from the oral route.


In my case, oral penicillins have the capacity to make me really ill with huge rashes over my body, puking and laboured breathing. An injection of penicillin would have me dead in a couple of minutes (even a tiny dose injected).


It's not a waste if it's something that could potentially save your life

i dunno how it is with the fly/dfly series, but my personal experience with 2c- compounds is that tolerance does not occur.  perhaps the furan 'wings' will change that, but then again perhaps not.

Sorry tathra, but every substance (which includes both phenetylamines and tryptamines) that is an agonist of the 5-HT2A receptor produces a cross tolerance, it's called receptor internalization.

While I agree that the phenethylamines produce a tolerance just as surely as a tryptamine or an ergoline, DMT doesn't produce a cross tolerance with other 5HT2a agonists (I think it's the only one - though I'm not sure about 5-methoxy DMT)

There are some strange aspects to 5-HT2A agonist tolerance. It develops increadibly fast, much faster than tolerance to most other drugs. Taking a constant dose daily leads to total tolerance to this dose within a few days. So I've read in credible sources. Yet, by taking a very high dose of one of the ultra-long lasting PEAs one can be tripping for several days. If tolerance was developing while on the trip, the effects should be fading faster, because the elimination of the drug and the receptor desensitation/internalization should work synergistically towards an accelerated decay.

eCsTaSy NoN sToP, my man, I can assure (!) you, Shulgin was either not quoted right or he has lost his mind. I know for sure that it is active at 400ug and probably less than that! 650ug had me tripping pretty good today. I don't think it lasts as long as people claim it to last though.

I have had to "abort" the trip with 200mg of Kratom alkaloids because of severe back pain... ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)

Worst back pain I have ever had in my whole life actually. I also had severe pain in other jonts (I have a chronic medical condition, the drug didn't make these symptoms pop up out of nowhere, but it definitely has a strong influence on them!) and my digestive and urinary tract felt like shit as well. Totally tripped out, like someone poured nitrohydrochloric acid through my body. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png) We're talking about a low dose here. I don't think I have ever experienced these symptoms to such an extent at such a low dose with any other psychedelic. Body load does seem to be very strong with this one. I mentioned before that there was some nausea present as well. Very little though.


Btw, the trip was fun, peak is reached at about 5 hours after ingestion, effects get weaker at the twelve hour mark I'd say. It might just be me getting used to the effects though, it felt like it got less intense, but then again, I've never had such a long trip before... It's T+15:30 now and I think would still feel pretty tripped out if I wouldn't have ingested the Kratom.

1mg should hit the spot for me! Pretty sure about that, probably comparable to about 17mg of 2C-B, unless the dose response curve is much steeper like fastandbulbous expected it to be. I am not giving out recommendations here because I might have built up a tolerance (!!!), but I will most likely go for 1mg on the voov experience next week.


If I still feel lingering effects tomorrow, I will make sure to inform you guys about it, unless Blowmonkey would rather have me not doing it.

alright, maybe shulgin is a little whacked out... i do agree on the point about people lying about how long it lasts!! "yeah man, i was trippin' balls for 3 weeks straight"

well, if anything, perhaps you should keep some good pain killers around.. personally, i'd say some salvia extract would do you good. on the whole tripping on both fronts deal, yeah, i know, but salvia is very opiate like on the body. if not, some hard-hitting indica (like a g13 or sensi star) will definitely take care of the pain and if not, there's always morphine :D


p.s. someone was a bit worried about the structure before, because of the furan rings... just out of curiosity, what do you think of salvinorin-A with its furan group sticking out to the side?

Have you considered the possibility that people respond differently. With DPT for example, some people claim they get good effects with as little as 50 or 100mg oral. I don't get effects with as much as 300mg DPT orally. Whenever you have a drug that is that is mostly removed by first pass metabalism, you can get a wide variation in oral dosage in different people. Why? Well, as a simple example, if in one person first pass metabolism removes 95% of the drug, and in another person removes 85% of the drug, then the latter person is going to 3 times as much drug entering into general circulation.

**bromo dragonfly the 2nd (please no arguing)**


I felt this forum should be rencarnated and since no one else seems to have I decided to do it. Please no one argue, understand and except that others are going to do what they want to do. No amount of arguing will change this just common sense and that is for them to decide. If you cant calmly and openly discuss something then just take a breather until you can. But thank you to all that contributed in the last forum  until it was shut down. Anyway that being said, to the topic at hand. Since the last posting who has tried taking this substance or found anything out else about it.

Just to say that at the 1st sign of this turning into the last bromo-dragonfly thread. one of the mods will shut it down just as quickly.


The small amount of info from the previous thread seems to be as follows:


DOB-dragonfly (aka bromodragonfly)


Oral dose: somewhere between 500-1000ug (0.5-1mg)

IM dose: 100ug


Duration of active dose: still unknown


Reason for poor oral availability: unknown


Interaction with other drugs: unknown

Have any suppliers of DOBDF (this is the name I choose to use now ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) )provided NMR or GC/MS analysis for this material?  In light of poorly manufactured 2C-TFM coming to market before the impure quality was discovered, I'd be very suspect of any reports until the authenticity of this material can be verified.

By golly, good chap, you've pegged me! 8) 


For the 0,5-1,0mg dose range, is there really any solid data for that? I've seen Shulgin's article that mentions 1mg oral having no activity. I've seen a 2nd hand report I was told came from a vendor saying that it was psychedelic at 2mg. I've seen cr00k's report but considering the staggered repeated doses mixed with DPT, N2O and other things, I can't quite say I think it's entirely useful information. I've seen several reports from various places where people have taken several hundred microgram with little or no psychedelic activity. The IM dose of 0,1mg is a second hand report from Shulgin based on one single trip. A poster here reported an IV dose with what sounded like a minimum of trip. Methinks its too premature to call the dose numbers as more than possible ranges for now. We need more information, and people ought be aware that doses could turn out to be much lower or higher.

^^

FastandFabulous' dose range is right on (500mg-1000mg). Talk to a few people who've actually tried this drug before you start questioning what information one of the brightest mods on this site decides to make public.


It is also known to take 3-5 hours before any effects are felt, and last 18 to 40 hours after that. Apparently duration is very much dependent on dose.


One side effect that concerns me is that a few people have mentioned their hearts feeling very strained by this compound.


I could give a bit more second hand info about this compound but I'll give posters here who've actually tried it a chance.

I got the information from a friend (who wishes to remain anonymous) who has synthed the DOB dragonfly (in future I think I'll adopt MGS's shortened version) so there's no doubt about the identity of the compound. He ran a lot of personal assays of the material (as well as the DOB fly compound) and he gave the active oral dose of the racaemate as ~800ug (the (R) isomer being active at about the 400ug mark, orally). He's also done a limited toxicity test and took up to 4000ug (4mg) of the raceamic compound orally. He described that as being rather unpleasant - 96hrs of almost total loss of contact with concensus reality and after effects lasting up to 120 hrs. Other than through things like sleep deprivation, he said that there were no long lasting toxic effects, in both the physiological and psychological sense (the compound showed much less of the muscle tension/cramping effect than DOB on a dose for dose comparison)


I've known him for quite a while (from days of the Hive) and he's a totally trustworthy & methodical person when it comes to self trials of new psychoactives (I've corresponded with him over quite a few theoretical SAR extensions, some of which he's synthed and tasted).


As he didn't want to be identified with the info source, I've not posted any of the info he's sent me, but it has reached the point where it's time to put forward his findings as nobody else seems to follow any strict self testing protocol (he's OK with the info being presented, as long as his anonimity is retained, which I understand perfectly and am not about to breach for anybody).


PS blue dolphin, it's fastandbulbous, not fastandfabulous. The fact that a few people think that's my name makes me think that I must somehow come across as a bit narcissistic - honestly, fastandbulbous is a much more accurate descriptive name!

Well this shows that it *is* possible to make it at least. In the early days I had the premonition that it was going to be prohibitively difficult to manufacture. I guess it still would be if it gets driven underground but as a RC the synthesis looks feasible.

The only bromo-dragonfly blotters are plain white blotters from Sweden. Even if this drug is active at 0,5mg (and many reports I've read say it takes more like 2mg) it sells for 35 euro per 1mg so how daft would a dealer need to be to sell doses of it as the much cheaper LSD?


Almost every report I have read has been "my pal knows a guy..." 


cr00k is the only first-hand report I have seen where somebody got effects off under 1mg, and he was taking other drugs (DPT &c). Almost every other first-hand report was inactive, except for the 2mg report where somebody tripped quite hard.


Being a moderator is fine and dandy, but it is too soon to say the dose and effects for certain. We need more first hand reports.

^^^


I did also post in that thread, that I had tried 150ug orally and it was barely threshold (definitely noticeable though really, very weak though) and then about 650ug orally (no tolerance like cr00k) and it was a mild trip.


Bluedolphin and F&B are right on with the dose - and if the dose/response curve is steep (i believe thats what i read in the other thread) then yes I could see how going from 650ug to 2mg would make for an intense long ride.  (F&B - was the racemic version of dob - dragonfly taken up to 8mg/8000ug and then the R isomer up to 4mg/4000ug? or possibly even both up to 8mg, i forget now)


Maybe I should type up a trip report? I actually was.. but my computer crashed ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)

First hand reports are needed, if you tried the stuff you should write something up. Seems almost something that's a responsibility for those who have access to really new things. Even if it is short, write something and post here or Erowid or wherever you find appropriate. If all we have to go on is 'I trust this guy and he said his mate said he did this much and it was good' that's better than nothing at all, but, it isn't very much either.


I heard a report tonight from somebody who took 500 and said 750 might be worthwhile. That's data, but without a report, it isnt very useful considering how little information there is, and how much information seems to be wrong. Some people on other forums claim it takes 5 or 6 hours to kick in, and lasts for 40 hours. Some people are taking a bunch and saying no activity. It only gets more confusing that some people are getting blotter acid from festivals and thinking its Br-dragonflies and then reporting the effects of what is probably acid as Br-dragonfly effects.


All I am saying is with so much hear-say passing around, maybe we should be somewhat cautious about issuing absolute statements about dose and effect until there is more information.

I know one of the RC vendor suppliers and the product of his synthesis was analysed before going to the RC vendors. Whether the other vendors have bothered to get theirs analysed is anybody's guess I'm assuming that they must have done business before with these people, so have a previous history of getting what they are paying for. If not, then that does seem rather amiss


PS. MGS, I think your acronym is the one that'll end up being used - DOB-DF/DOBDF is a hell of a lot easier to type than any of the others ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

F&b's source also gave me the same information, so I can fill in. It was under the condition to keep it private, but as f&b started to make it public (with permission of our source I assume), I'll just add what I know:


Racemic DOB-dfly: orally active from about 0.8 mg, similar at this dose in effect and duration to low dose DOB. Took up to 8 mg which causes long-lasting (4 days) effects, very intense, depersonalization, delirium, nausea, headache, strong body stimulation, sleep deprivation.


(R)-DOB-dfly, the more potent isomer: orally active from about 0.4 mg, similar in effect and duration to low dose DOB. Took up to 16 mg which causes long-lasting (5 days) effects, very intense, similar to above, but more body toxcity, this is clearly a toxic level.


(R)-DOB-fly, the more potent isomers of the non-aromatic compound: orally active from about 0.8 mg, similar in effect and duration to low dose DOB. Took up to 16 mg which caused effects similar to 8 mg of DOB-dfly.


Our anonymous researcher took heroic amounts in order to evaluate the toxicity and activity of the these compounds before making them available to the public. I think he deserves our unconditional respect for his thoroughness and for bringing these rare compounds out of Nichols' lab and to the general public.


I have also received a third-hand report from a different source, according to wich DOB-dfly caused very intense effects boardering on a delirium lasting 48 hours in a oral dose of 2 mg. I have reason to believe that this report is reliable. However, the source for the broader report above did not experience such strong and long-lasting effects from this dose.


Thus, there might indeed be a very steep dose-response curve for DOB-dfly as I predicted from the available in vitro data, and there might be a strong inter-individual variation in response to a given dose.


Lastly, I think this thread should be merged with the unnecessarily closed first dfly thread into a Big & Dandy dlfy thread. There definitely **is** useful information in the closed thread. I remember posting information on receptor affinities and EC50 values etc, others posted initial *in homo* experimental results. A full 14 pages of useless nonsense and stupidity, as gloggawogga claims? "There is virtually no usefull information in this thread anyways because of all the relentless stupidity as it is." Excuse me, but I feel offended by being told that what I posted was "relentless stupidity" and "useless".


It doesn't make sense to have the information on these compounds so scattered just because of the arbitrary decision of an overzealous mod. I don't think some transient 'noise' is sufficient reason to close a thread that had grown and developed nicely to span 14 pages. If gloggawogga thinks he has to censor every nonconformist comment and stifle every thread that doesn't develop exactly how he thinks it should, I have a suggestion for him: emigrate to China and seek a job with the gov't there, they have high demand for your skills.


This is not the first time that he arbitrarily closed a thread for no good reason. I wonder if there are internal statistics which mod closed how many threads. I feel gloggawogga would lead by a wide margin. He also leads by a wide margin when it comes to rudeness towards and disrespect for the average user and other people's opinion. We john doe users deserve the same respect as demigod mod gloggawogga. Tell you something, gloggawogga: without us users you could moderate yourself.


Sorry, folks, but I just had to get this off my chest. The mods here are doing an excellent job, but the totalitarian and autocratic attitude of this one just pisses me off.

16mg?It seems, altough uncomfortable, yet less toxic than DOB (assuming he never took DOB above 5mg)

It would be interesting to know if these side effects come later in the experiment or are manifest with the peak.If the latter holds true it might be inherent in the compound meaning there must be some other receptor/transmitters/peripheral pathways involved (unusual high 5-HT2C activity we already know),otherwise I tend to to see it as exhaustion signs/hangover starts during experiment,typical of these >20h/highly lipophilic compounds (at least my experience).

Please don Pedro, quit misleading people here. What you are doing is very (!) dangerous. I have not taken any drugs in combination with my final Bromo-Dragonfly trial until the 11 hour mark. We have told you again and again, please read the report once more. I'm asking you to edit your posts, you are misleading people into taking higher doses than necessary.

^ In the intrests of harm reduction, I have to agree. There are several reports of DOBDF being active orally in the 500-1000ug (0.5-1mg) range. Given that, and some reports of a seemingly very steep dose-response relationship, stating that it's inactive under 1mg orally could potentially mislead someone into thinking that they needed to dose over 1mg orally to get any sort of response (yes, I know you should always start very low and work up, but some people do look to forums like this for info on what is the 'standard' dose).


I think it's always best to state any dose as being the average lowest reported active dose. If for some reason a person finds that the stated dose is too low they can always up the dose the next time. This seems far better than someone taking what amounts to a 'fuck-off' dose thinking it's the 'average' active dose and ending up in an A&E dept because the trip becomes far too intense

As long as there are not much more experience reports it's not safe to give any dose range because of the particular pharmacokinetics of these compounds. Obviously, oral bioavailability is quite low, maybe 10% (100 mug IM vs. 1000 mug orally). The oral bioavailability will hardly be exactly the same in every person and will probably also depend on other factors such as food and beverages consumed. Think of THC, very poorly bioavailable orally, but much more so if ingested with oil/fat. 


So if we tell people that a good dose is 1 mg and in a certain person it has a bioavailability of 20% instead of 10%, which isn't such a big variation, the dose would equate 2 mg. According to the report I received 2 mg can already cause an out-of-control trip which requires a sitter and would not be manageable in many situations (at a rave etc for example).


Like probably everyone else who read about these benzodifuranes in Nichols' publications I had high hopes for them. The structure was beautiful, the potency intriguing. And I'm very glad that our anonymous friend synthesized them and made them available to the wider public. Else at least I would have wondered about these dragonflies for the rest of my days.


But now that there are *in homo* experiences I must say that they are very disappointing in every respect. Oral potency is at least an order of magnitude lower than anticipated. The slow onset and long duration of the effect are a clear minus. The effect itself doesn't seem to be anything what other, more reliable and calculable psychedelics don't offer. There is a lot of potential danger and little to reward the psychonaut.


I feel that the world wouldn't loose anything if these compounds vanish again and can't be found anywhere but in Nichols' lab.

I wouldn't be so quick to dismiss the fly and dragonlfly series simply because DOB-dfly turns out to be a dud. There are good reports of 2c-b-fly, and there are many more compounds possible, DOM-fly, DOM-dfly, 2c-e-fly, etc. etc. I wouldn't be surprised if at least one or two of the entire series turns out to be a gem. Most new research chemicals are duds, imho, but it doesn't mean we don't keep searching for the few good ones that are out there.

Having found 2C-B a second-rate psychedelic, and having no interest whatsoever in DOB, the existance of BRDF does not excite me.  My days of spending $1000s to collect every single psychedelic released are long over.  Now I will save my money for benzodifuran analogues of DOM, DOET, 2C-D, and 2C-E.  Those are the ones I will be seaking out.

I did not say to say its inactive under 1mg. I said there are conflicting reports and its too soon to be saying with absolute certainty what the dose range is. Some people say its active under 1mg, others don't, and theres very few first hand reports. If someone asks what the dose is for Br-dragonfly, the right answer is "we don't know yet, but it could be 0,5-2,0mg or thereabout." Saying low numbers when we aren't totally sure yet isn't harm reduction. It's dishonest, same as if someone said for sure it's inactive orally. Even if your intent is harm reduction, you have to be honest, and that means you have to mention that there are reports of people taking 1mg orally with no effects, as well as saying that there are reports of trips with less doses.

What reports though. I had asked you before and the mentioned reports sound like hearsay to me.


As far as I am concerned, I agree that threshold doses seem to start somewhere around 300ug, while a standard dose should be settled around 750-1000ug. Again we have to consider the steep dose response curve and the potential differences in bio availability mentioned earlier in this thread.

^ Other than the comment from Shulgin, I'm finding it difficult to pin down a report of 1mg of DOBDF being inactive by mouth. While I'm more than happy to conceed that without Shulgin's work, this forum (and a lot of psychedelic discussion) most probably wouldn't exist, he seems to be way out on this one. I recently tried 250ug of DOBDF orally and got mild effects, most probably comparable with 0.5mg of DOB, so the idea that it's inactive at 1mg seems way way off (the sort of thing that might be explained by having a tolerance at the time of taking a 1mg dose).

I'm being honest. Most people have reported threshold activity at the 200-400ug dose level; those who've taken larger doses (600-1000ug) seem to be reporting pretty much a full psychedelic type of activity. Just because of one anomaly of someone getting no response at 1mg doesn't mean that it has to be included in the *average* active dose. Some people say that they only get full effects from 2C-E with doses of 30mg. Despite their reports, I don't see anyone suggesting that the average dose for 2C-E be adjusted to include them; most people need between 10-20mg for a full blown experience.


Harm reduction means noting what the *lowest* active dose is, to prevent anyone getting in over their head, but there's no requirement to state what the highest dose for some people to trip is. It's not just me thinking this way either - have a look at the notes on Erowid's AMT dosage page [here](http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/amt/amt_dose.shtml) .

The average for 2C-E is a tad more meaningful though. How many people have taken 2C-E? How many have taken Br-DFLY?

Out of the people who have taken DOBDF, how many have reported no activity at an oral dose of 1mg. The whole idea of an *average* dose is based on percentages. Other than Shulgin's report, nobody here has reported no activity at the 1mg mark; so *on average*, the active dose is between 500-1000ug, the same way that *on average*, the active dose of 2C-E is between 10-20mg

Someone on another forum posted translations from a Swedish drugs forum (Sweden being the country where an internet headshop was selling blotters of 100mic BDFLY) and there were quite a few people posting about being unable to trip from the stuff and being peeved about finding out it didnt do much orally (at least at reasonably priced doses). It seems as if there was much hype on the Swedish site about this chemical, as elsewhere, but once they actually started trying it, the hype faded quite rapid when people weren't getting off.


I've just seen another report on another forum of a 500mic trip, this one a fairly detailed first person report. Effects felt in 20 minutes, peak in 3 hours, person went to sleep at like 12 hours after dosing. Person got good effect, but found it a little lacking and would do 750mic if they did it again.


I still stand by my earlier statements that (at the time I posted) it was too early to give absolute information. But it does seem like newer data is increasingly indicating oral activity in the 500-1000mic range. The rumors about it taking 5-6 hours to kick in, or that peak lasts for 40 hours, seem to be bunk tho.

MGS, can you elaborate more on this please? in regards to the benzodifuran analogues. What are these?

and why the interest?

500-1000uc indeed, I guess the newer data you are referring to is the other 500uc report you have mentioned.

Anyway, I was definitely NOT able to go to sleep at T+12:00, I'd say I just left the plateau at that point.

It took me 5 hours to peak as it did for some other people. I felt the first effects after about 90 minutes when I woke up.

While it was in the old thread, just to re-state what i said in the previous thread:


There is indeed a batch of bromo dragonfly blotters floating around (and supply is increasing with time). I've taken one of them, it was orally active, quite visually intense and amphetamine like, with a peak comming at 6-8 hours after ingestion, and with a duration of around 26 hours. 


I would have written a trip report, however, i took a large dose of a benzo halfway through the trip, which i feel negates the ability to write a proper trip report.


If anyone wants my opinion on the drug, the duration is simply too long for comfort, and i was unable to sleep until 28 hours after ingestion. It's very powerful visually however, and not especially difficult from a psychological standpoint.

There is indeed a batch of rumors of bromo dragonfly blotters floating around (and supply is increasing with time). So far the rumors seem to be based on nothing more than "I heard on the internet about this new powerful drug people are selling as acid, and I just had a weird trip, so it had to be bromo-dragonfly!"


It makes no sense, why would somebody sell an expensive and hypeful drug as a cheap and common one? If anything people are selling acid as bromo-dragonfly.


Until there's solid evidence like a chemical analysis or at the very least somebody who's tried known bromo-dragonfly from a chemicals seller who tries one of these "bromo-dragonfly blotters" and confirming it is the same thing, I am going to keep my tent pitched in the septic camp. I have had acid trips where I couldn't sleep for over 24 hours, I've had acid take over an hour to kick in, and I know those were acid because I took trips on the same strip of paper at other times and had more usual effects. Acid is a remarkably variable drug.

I sure did like the effects, but then again, there hasn't been any psychedelic I did not like (besides 5-MeO-DMT, but I think I might become friends with that one as well within the next couple of years).

Actually, on a (psychedelics!) scale between one and ten, it would rate somewhere near one... Maybe 3.

-I didn't like the effect it had on my back pain 

-I didn't like the chemical/acidic feeling in my gastrointestinal tract

-It just takes too long, 10 hours is definitely enough for me

-It wasn't very deep, but that might change at a higher dose


In order to be able to rate this drug I would definitely have to take more, maybe 1mg. At low doses like these most psychedelics feel much more alike to me than at higher doses.


One more thing about the back pain... My back (and other joint) problems are getting worse and worse these days. Although a psychedelic has never induced such a sensitivity to my pain before, it might not be related to the substance... I's possible that I might have experienced the same severity of pain increase with any psychedelic. I know for sure that I'm never gonna enter a trip without opiates at hand though from this day on.

Something else I "noticed" is that my pain has never been worse than within the past two weeks. I have always succeeded in not taking pain meds to treat it, but if I had some now... Maybe this is related to the effects of the psychedelic, I don't know. I'll be observing how this developes.

Not to send this thread into a tangent, but I also started to develop back/shoulder/spinal area related pain,  that in retrospect, also seemed to increase as my use of psychedelics increased. I wonder if going through all the bodyloads from each substance taught my body to hold certain bad postures or tensing postures...not sure, but I found it interesting that you also have had a similar experience...

I would say that the problem with oral doses of DOBDF is down to one of two things 1) It is either metabolized by gut enzymes or undergoes extensive 1st pass metabolism OR 2) it is subject to irregular absorbtion from the gut.


Either could account for the large variation of effects of oral doses. One test to distinguish between the two would be to try something like rectal absorbtion. If it's mainly 1st pass metabolism, rectal admin (of an identical dose) should produce the same effects in people with sizeably different responses to an oral dose. If it's an absorbtion problem, the differences in oral effects should be mirrored by rectal admin (as the membrane is essentially the same).

^ What about sublingual dosing? Would a few drops under the tongue be effective..? How long would they need to be held there?


Some of the variety of responses via oral admin might be due to the length of time the chemical being held in the mouth...

@>Crook

Thank you crook! You are a pioneer indeed, i respect that.


@>Catfish

I believe that certain body pains; from my experiences with psychedelics, are do to certain posters we tend to lay in while tripping. I lot of time i really don't feel or pay any attention to my body while tripping especially when the visuals and euphoria is intense.


@>This tread

For what it is worth; DOBDF really don't sound all that interesting! Hopefully 2C-B-fly will be making it's rounds and Dom-fly too. Those two JUST mite prove to be full of those bells and whistles floating around in the elusive psychedelic soup bowl, we are all looking for.

Plenty of phenethylamines and amphetamines make mine (and many of my friends) backs feel tired, sore, or tight. I am not surprised that bromo-dragonfly seems to have this property for people who are sensitive to back problems.

This thread seems to have died, but in the intrest of harm reduction, i thought it was worth bumping.


I recently came across a max headroom blotter, which is suspected to contain bromo dragonfly. Given that no information is out about the dosage of a blotter, i'd reccomend that people abstain from taking it until more information could be discovered, but anyone who comes across this blotter print should know it is certaintly not LSD.

Dude the max headroom tabs are DOB, there is another forum on here that someone actually tested one of the blotters and found that it wasnt acid but DOB. This is more likely the kind of stuff people are getting instead of Bomo DragonFly when they say its not acid and phene like.

Yeah, I ahve experienced it with other phens as well, but never as bad as this time which might just be related to the current condition of my back.

5mg of bromo-dragonfly was disolved in 5ml of water. 1.3 ml was taken at 3:45pm. i got no visuals at all. i was laughing at funniest home videos, so something was happening. my mood was happy, but not trippy. sometimes i got headaches, esp when i'd smoke a cone of pot.


At about midnight i was agitated because i couldnt sleep and nothing was on tv. i eventually fell asleep at about 4:30am, and woke up at 7:30, headache gone, but body feeling beaten.


the experience wasreally fucking dull, almost painful at times. the last 3.7mls was put in to the fridge only to be spilled by some freak accident. i managed to save a ml (i think) as the spill was isolated. there goes my birthday present ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)

Sadly, I agree. I also truly hope this does not turn into a pandora's box. I think we could expect some bad fly-related news soon ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png) I sure do hope that people who intend to play with this compound have very accurate scales (and I am sure very few actually do...). 


Ranting aside, I do not know if the following has been mentioned before or not, but it certainly isn't in this thread. 


F&B and anyone else who has a good grasp on SARs: Has there ever been any testing for this compound's Cholinergic affinities? I say this because the effects remind me an awful lot of Scopolamine and friends. And I mean not only the long-lasting delirium, but also the blood pressure...etc.. If there are no such formal studies, do you think that it might have some anticholinergic properties?


If not, then perhaps it could help shed more light on how anticholinergics do what they do...

^ the only bad d-fly news i think you'll get is people like me who totally wasted thier money. i have read **no first hand reports** of anything happening with this chemical. Only 3 people have reported any effect off it on this board, and none of them are that interesting. no one reported delerium or even any visuals. IMHO its a dud, a big waste of time and money.

I was refering to the info Re: Delerium in the beginning of the thread such as those quoted below. I was also refering to the 'fly compounds in general, not picking on one of them - however,none so far seemed to show any positives to outweigh the negatives IMO. I haven't been following what appears to be an aweful (and largely deleted) history that this thread has, so I'm sorry if I misinterpreted something... 


As for bad news, although thankfully no bad news has been reported yet, I seriously don't think it'll be long before someone does something with these compounds akin to snorting a large dose of 2C-T-7 on top of Ecstasy, be it intentionally or not. One poster for example, mentioned that they spilled their sample in the fridge. Though the poster may have been careful (not to pick on anyone), such a potent and apparently toxic compound has no business spilling in non-specialist John-Smith's fridge. Again, not intending to pick on anyone - and I am certainly in no position to judge who should have access to what - but I personally don't have any interest in these compounds.

I have to say it has a HUGE bodyload at doses above 100mcg, accompanied by wild hallucinations and severe delusion.  


However, it is wonderful at the 25-100mcg range.  This isn't the one to be a hero with, trust me I been there and you pay a really huge fucking price for it.  At smaller doses it is terrific though

I may be really sensitive to it, or the blotters I got may be really really potent, because no one I know could handle more than three of em.  They were the radiant heart design that some people call "love parade"

Ah right, blotters. So how exactly do you know what was on the blotters and how much of whatever it was? Where do you get the 25-100mic figure from since you just said maybe the blotters were "really really potent"?


Since every other "serious" report on Br-DFLY I've read shows very variable responses, but certainly not that active, I'm inclinded to believe you didn't have Br-DFLY, or certainly not the amount you think you did.


If Shulgin says the activity is 200-450mcg, then I'm inclinded to believe him rather than someone who got some untested blotter.  ![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif)

The prescence of bromo-dragonfly on blotters, despite being rumored for months now, has yet to be proven.  None has ever been tested and posted.  As far as I can tell, the rumor started on the shroomery, and has just taken off among "common wisdom" with nothing to back it up by way of proof.  If the "heart" blotters all have the same substance on them, it only makes sense that there will be some agreement about their effects.  People seem to be using other "blottor bromo" reports to compare to their own, rather than the scanty data out there from people using known, pure materials, which indicates very low oral activity at doses up to 1mg.


Of course, one possible exception is the plain white blotter that clown in Sweden was selling, more reasonably assumed to be bromo-dragonfly as it ws advertised as such.  User reports on those, too, indicated very little activity.


I'll be happy to eat my words if someone produces an analysis of the "heart" blotters, but I don't believe they're bromo-dragonfly.

The only lab tested blotter posted on bluelight was DOB. So I guess you could call it "bromo" blotter, if you wanted to confuse the matter further.


Here: [http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/showthread.php?t=214014&highlight=bromo+dragonfly](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/showthread.php?t=214014&highlight=bromo+dragonfly)


This whole bromo-dragonfly on blotter rumour is just that, a lot of rumour, just like djfriendly says. Since Br-DFLY is difficult and expensive to make, I would highly doubt that it has made it onto blotter in the US. Much more likely that people had some of the DOB (or possibly DOI) blotter that was floating around at the same time that the reports of "I had some blotter that wasn't acid OMG it must be bromo-dragonfly" started appearing.


Course, if you have link to some lab tested Br-DFLY blotter that would change the situation completely. But unless you do, stop spreading groundless rumours.

I'd like to make a plea to start calling this material DOB-dragonfly, as calling it "bromo-dragonfly" begs the question of whether one is discussing the dragonfly version of DOB or that of 2C-B.  Although 2C-B-dragonfly has not yet shown up on the market, the term still leaves confusion.  The suffixes "fly" and "dragonfly" do not denote whether or not the compound is alpha-methylated.

**18 year old boy dies from homemade bromo-dragonfly**


Ok so I just found [this](http://www.dagbladet.no/nyheter/2007/03/09/494460.html) article in a norwegian newspaper. 


It says a boy who they previously though died from GHB in an institution instead died from bromo-dragonfly, a hallucinogen similar to amphetamines and LSD. It was apparently also homemade. His two other friends also tried it, but they were fine.. And the guy who they think gave it to them is being charged with murder.


I don't know much about this bromo-dragonfly, so do you think this is accurate?

are there post mortems and coroners reports in norway? I think a death due to something this unusual would be noted somewhere. then again who knows what the stuff that as been offered as bromodragonfly by certain scandinavian vendors is.


I have heard from 2 sources  that the UK Forensic science service has recently come across 2-cb fly.


anyone got any more on this story, there is no doubt that bromodragonfly can kill by the same mechnism as DOB in overdose. the greater potency of the dragonfly probably means that the lethal dose is proportionally lower, (depending on the theraputic index)


would really like to see more on this story.


another question is dragonfly the aromatic version ie benzodifuran rather than terahydrobenzodifuran?

Den 18 år gamle gutten som døde etter å ha ruset seg  på en barnevernsinstitusjon på Trysil tidligere i vinter, døde av et hjemmelaget stoff som minner om LSD og amfetamin.


Dermed stemmer ikke politiets antakelser om at 18-åringen døde etter bruk av det farlige stoffet GHB , skriver Hamar Arbeiderblad.


18-åringen døde lørdag 3. februar etter å ha ruset seg på ungdomsinstitusjonen der han bodde. Gutten skal ifølge politiets etterforskning ha brukt et kjemisk stoff som kalles «Dragonfly»  (Bromo-benzodifuranyl-isopropylamin) et hallusinogen som påvirker sentralnervesystemet, skriver avisen.


To andre ungdommer ruset seg også på stoffet, men ingen av dem fikk alvorlige skader.


En kamerat av 18-åringen som politiet mener ga ham stoffet, er siktet for uaktsomt drap.

Thanks for the translation, Redeemer. 


This story still sounds a little fishy.  First of all the mention of homemade obviously seems a little absurd.  Secondly, how did the cause of death change from GHB to Br-dfly?  I think the two would be very hard to confuse.  Maybe it was a combination ... there's really not enough evidence to draw any useful conclusions from this report.

I think Norwegian articles on illegal drugs follow the same unwritten rules as drug stories from all other countries do in that it is allowed add words such as 'homemade' and 'dangerous' to pep up the article in exchange for jounalistic accuracy.

**The Teeny and Weeny Bromo-Dragonfly Thread**


I've noticed there is no Big and Dandy thread on Bromo-Dragonfly that I could find, and there are no experiences (that I could find) on Bluelight, so I figured I'd start one (if one already exists, delete this post and PM me).  It's a phenylethylamine and its full chemical name is Bromo-benzodifuranyl-isopropylamine.  It is active at 100-800 micrograms according to Erowid, although it says there is a "euro batch" and a "2006" batch and the doses are completely different ([Erowid's Bromo-Dragonfly Dosage Page](http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/bromo_dragonfly/bromo_dragonfly_dose.shtml)).


[Erowid Bromo-Dragonfly Vault](http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/bromo_dragonfly/bromo_dragonfly.shtml)

[Wikipedia Bromo-Dragonfly Information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bromo-Dragonfly)


SWIM recently found that it is going around.  SWIM will definitely need to use liquid measurement to dose this one, right?  SWIM's thinking that liquid measurement would be easiest.  By making it a 50-100mcg of ABDF per 1ml of solution and dosing that way I think would be the best way (correct me if I'm wrong).  Dissolving 10mg into 1000ml of 80% water/20% ethanol would make a solution of 100mcg/ml, correct?  If there is a better solution to store it in where it will degrade slower, please tell me.  Also, will I need to keep this particular RC airtight/light-proof in the freezer?  How stable is this chemical and how fast does it degrade?


Anyone have any experience with this chemical (also known as ABDF or DOB-Dragonfly)?  What are its effects like (I know it lasts 10-24 hours)?  What other psychedelic would its effects be most similar to?  Is it stimulating?


Lets get this thread moving and to expand, and a mod/admin will probably add it to the Big And Dandy archive.  Get some intelligent discussion going.

'Homemade' can refer to a chemical that was synthesized illicitly in a lab somewhere, not necessarily homemade by the person in possession/ingesting the chemical.


Very sad story. I  am scared of these very potent psychedelic amphetamines coming onto the market. I hope this is NOT an overdose on br-dfly and the story is just inaccurate. I do hope it is not a premonition of whats to come.

I've always interpreted homemade as having a small scale set up that can be operated in a residential premesis unlike say the bif amphetamine labs in europe that operated like proper labs (well in the context of equipment etc - far from proper labs in terms of safety at work, COSHH regs etc)

Well anyone *could* figure laying blotter out, it would just be REALLY easy to fuck up I think (like using too much water), and I would like to know the **proper** way.  I would have no idea how many ml's of water SWIM would have to use to lay one sheet, and the last thing he wants to do is ruin his batch.  I removed the part about that anyways, SWIM will use liquid measurement.


Still no comments or experiences with this compound???  What about the ideal dosage of the batch that's going around right now?  800ug?

Well, for one, I don't think you should be using water or dipping the paper in anything.


2nd, based on what little reports there are, except to cause major accidents if you have at target dose of 800mcg.


This stuff sounds ... maybe not so worthwhile really. I guess only time will tell, but some amount of time has already gone by, the general public has easy access to it if they stop and look for a few seconds, and I don't know anyone that wants to take it.

Why shouldn't I use water for liquid measurement?  Is there a solution that would be better than 80/20 water/ethanol?  Please enlighten me.


Well, what I want to know is if ANYONE on this board has tried it, what dose, and how their experience was.


I would start with like 200-250mcg and work my way up from there.

Water will run all over the place and evaporate slowly... about as slowly as anything you're going to get your hands on, I'd imagine. I'd rather use an absolute alcohol or diethyl ether or something (I don't know anything about its solubility in anything) that would evap really quick so it can't run all over into adjacent tabs. I'd also want to dispense it directly onto each hit with some sort of metered pipette made for high accuracy and precision with extremely small volumes of fluid, after I'd weighed 100mg at least on a scale accurate to something around/under 100mcg.


How the hell are you going to know how much is on a tab if you just dip it in some slow evaporating liquid and let it run all over the place? You won't, and worse, the whole sheet will be all uneven and erratic.


This is a LONG LASTING drug. You don't want to fuck up with it.


There also haven't been a whole lot of people pushing the limit with it, so the toxicity thing is not really pinned down AFAIK.

Yes I have tried it, once sublingually at a dose of 250mcg.


You can read my report here:


[http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/showthread.php?t=231568&highlight=dragonfly](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/showthread.php?t=231568&highlight=dragonfly)


For the record, I found it very pleasent, not unlike I  imagine DOB, but very long lasting.


Although a casual search would have turned it up, as well as other peoples experiences....


I don't even think the issue is really with the water measurement - you are handling a drug known to be active in sub-milligram doses, with a couple of reports of very intense experiences with doses in the few milligram range. Precautions should be taken - personally I wouldn't handle pure powder of DOx or LSD without basic precautions of gloves, mask, in a work area that can be properly washed down. This isn't evn like LSD where poor practice is simply going to give you (probably quite heavy) trip if you accidentally ingest some - high doses of DOB and related substances seem to be much less well tolerated.


Accidentally inhaling, swallowing or somehow ingesting (microscopic crystal in a little cut...) a few mgs whilst handling could end you up in the ER.


Selling pure powder of something as unknown and as potent as Br-dfly is highly irresponsible.

I'm probably not laying blotter, hasssssle.


I'm going to use liquid measurement (dissolve 10mg in 1000ml of ethanol [is pure ethanol the best substance to use?]).  That will make it 100mcg per ml, which will be relatively easy to dose.


What do you guys think?

Are you planning to take it orally? There are really quite wild variations in the handle of oral reports I've heard, some getting full effects at 0.5mg and less, some not up til over 1mg. The oral bioavailabilty seems somewhat variable, so everyone should start their doses low - just because 1mg works great ofr you orally doesn't mean it will be fun for everyone else.


I mention this only in the spirit of harm reduction - I don't think you should be giving *anyone* Br-dfly.

i believe the DEA microgram reprts that some of the stuff sold as bromodragonfly was DOB, and all these intrepid psychonauts were doing is rediscovering the dosage level effects of DOB.


bromodragonfly hydrochloride  is soluble in ethanol, also isopropanol.


on the related topic if bromodragonfly did kill the norwegian chap then that makes it highly lethal on a par with the nerve agents, lethal dose in low milligrams.

I do NOT plan on selling this or anything, I don't even know if I'm gonna order it.  I just thought it would be nifty to put on blotter if it would have been easy.


IF i do decide to try this compound, I will heed all you guys' advice and I would use liquid measurement.


I should start out around 200-300mcg if I do, right?

There are some important notes provided under the dose page at Erowid as follows:


"Bromo-Dragonfly is a chemical which has very little history of human use and was used as a novel brain research chemical with rats in the mid 1990s at Purdue. When it was discovered to be active in rats, one of its important features was how potent it is. The doses used in rats (injected abdominally) were very small. A few years after the initial papers describing this chemical's activity in the brain, reports surfaced of human experimentation, suggesting oral activity well under 1 milligram. Some disputed these findings and said that Bromo-Dragonfly was only active under 1mg when injected.


In May 2005, a quantity of this chemical became available in some human experimental psychoactive markets. Erowid received a smattering of reports about its use and an increasing number of questions about it.


As of June 2006, we have received only 50-70 first-hand accounts of ingestion of Bromo-Dragonfly, only a few of these detailed enough to be considered full reports. The findings are very contradictory, with some people claiming strong oral activity at 300 micrograms (ug) of Bromo-Dragonfly, while others say they got virtually no effects at 1.5mg (1500 ug).


There may be two distinct "batches" of material: one more potent and one less. In 2006, most reports indicate that the dosage range for available material is 800-2000ug rather than the more potent batch of product sold as BromoDragonfly in 2005. In 2005, the more potent batch was sometimes called the "European" batch and the other batch as the "American", although this distinction is not in common use. It seems likely that they are not the same chemical, but it is impossible to know. Some blotter has been reported to have been dipped with Bromo-Dragonfly, some pills pressed, but mostly powder distributed from what little we can tell.


Also, there have been a growing number of reports of people saying that they got blotter that they thought was acid, but instead "definitely felt like something else". Generally, since there is no verification of the substance, these reports are ignored when trying to estimate dosage and effects of novel chemicals because they introduce too much noise and are prone to error.


Please note that with only a handful of reports of use, it is unsafe and unwise to assume that these are representative of how a chemical presumed to be Bromo-Dragonfly will affect other individuals. Please see the Research Chemical Vault for more information about chemicals for research that are sold for human consumption."


Given that the history of human use is incredibly short, and given that the documented history may not even be accurate with respect to the authenticity of the material and the doses taken, it appears that the level of knowledge of this substance and it's corresponding effects are sketchy at best.


Couple this with the vast variation of effects experienced by different people from the same substance, in different settings, and different doses, the answer becomes even less clear.  ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png) 


Also, to ask whether LSD and Bromo-dragonfly are "similar" has no real answer in any case, because the word 'similar' is undefined.  To say that there is no similarity because one is a tryptamine and one is a phenethylamine really is not correct or incorrect. It is correct in one sense, when one is comparing only psychedelic substances, but clearly LSD is "similar" to say, 2C-E, when compared against say, heroin.  So, an equivalent answer might be; of course they are similar, given that they are both psychedelic substances.


To say "LSD is fun", might also be perceived as a bizarre statement by many. ![8o](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eek.gif) 


In sum, I have done nothing in the way of providing an answer to your question, only suggested that an answer to your question is hard to reach at this point in time.


So, you could always gift the community by trying both, then writing a comparitive trip report and post it here or on Erowid!  To that, the community would be indebted I'm sure! 


Peace. :D

Well, compared to bromo-dragonfly it ceirtanly is. Many of my friends have tried it and even with large amounts all you get is very stimulated (not in a nice way)  and it doesn't create mind bending bizzare thoughts that you would never think otherwise. Plus the visuals and everything get boring after a few times. And how can anyone think that LSD isn't fun ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

**"Bromo-benzodifuranyl-isopropylamine" vs "D-isolysergic acid diethylamide"**


Hi there. It is very interesting for me to find a forum on such experiences...


As a chemist I am currently working with "bromo-benzodifuranyl-isopropylamine" (what I am presuming you are refering to as "Bromo-Dragonfly"). I will not say anymore about what I do, other than my responsibilities require that I do not use the laboratory facilities, or it resources, for any "unethical" conduct, as this could jepordise our research grant by having our liscence to work with "USDEA Schedule 1", Home Office Schedule 1 " chemicals revoked.


Having said that, I am happy to share with you my own observations derived from self experimentation.


Recently I have had the fortunate chance to experience both the psychedelic effects from ”bromo-benzodifuranyl-isopropylamine” and "D-isolysergic acid diethylamide" within one month of eachother. I am asured that the purity of "bromo-benzodifuranyl-isopropylamine" was near on 99.9%, as assayed by a cryometric method after HPLC (high performance liquid chromatography). The synthesis and purification steps also ensured that the "bromo-benzodifuranyl-isopropylamine" was of the more active D isomer.


The "D-isolysergic acid diethylamide" was manufactured by a third party chemical company (I will not mention their name here, for obvious reasons) and was provided in solution. 


While I will try not to go into too much depth by relaying my exact experiences with both chemicals, I am able to offer my own simple observations, citing the parts that I feel pertinant in being able to differentiate between the effects of each upon my own psyche. Please note, I am mearly offering this (to anyone who cares to read it) account to provide my fellow human beings with a first hand experience which resulted from the oral ingestion of these two psychedelic compounds. My hope is simply that the information provided might provide a person interested in such things, a better insight into their own experiences with psychedelics obtained on the "Black Market". 


Several months ago, under the supervision of a friend, I orally consumed 200 µg (via a dilution series) of "D-isolysergic acid diethylamide". I noticed the initial effects within 1 hour of ingestion, which characterised by a initial euphoria and a growing sensation that crept up my spine. At this point I removed myself from the living room to the garden.   


Two hours after ingestion, I thought I had peaked and was amazed at the perceptual illusions (which were highly disorientating for me, as I have never had previous experiences with this psychadelic hit me with such ferocity). This can only be due to the fact that this was a 99.9% pure batch of "D-isolysergic acid diethylamide”. Yay!


Three hours after ingestion: the effects carried on gaining in intensity and the conveyance of my experience via the mode of speach has completely fallen apart. My friend noted that while I was able to speak fluidly, the gramatical structure of my scentence flow was more abstract syntax than comprehendible prose... Both sight, sound and touch seemed to interplay off eachother in ways that invoked great joy and amusment. My mind painted a tangerine dream of ideas that seemed to cross and intertwine with one another through out this experience. Audio hallucinations are rife. Never before have I had such an immersive experience. Is this what pure "D-isolysergic acid diethylamide” is really like?


Three hours into the experience patterns had emerged from the grass underneath me. Even the soil in the flower beds formed amazing kaleidoscopic fractures around my central vision. Even the languid flow of the clouds in the very blue sky above seemed to be alive and flowing. At one point, while lying on the grass, I felt like I was lying flat on a wall (the ground was the wall)... This somewhat made me loose my cool, as I was suddenly was taken over by the idea that I might slide of the surface of the earth and fall into space!?!? Once this interesting delusion subsided, I had a realisation that everyhting was fractal in nature and that it all possessed its own eternity within the surface of its very form... The Bill Hicks’ quote “Matter is simply energy condensed into a slow vibration…” suddenly made me erupt in fits of laughter at it’s pure genius.  Everything was interlinked and connected on so many levels.  My hearing was completely distorted: I kept hearing echoes from every sound around me and even heard myself murmuring out aloud at one point, and then not being sure if it was simply just a thought in my mind…


Fours hours after ingestion: I found "myself" (that is my center of perception relating to my senses) several feet above my head. It was almost as though I became aware that there were several beings operating my movements from a higher dimension. Rather than "strings" being attached to my arms, I felt that these beings were using their combined thoughts to make me to act in this virtual  3D world. Suddenly I gave myself up to their demands and we all became one... Everything is normal!?!?    


5 hours after ingestion: I was somewhat glad when the effect  died down, as it had entered my mind on several occassions that I might have taken slightly too much. Thanks to my friend repeating "What goes up must come down, and remember... You're only tripping." I was able to keep these thoughts at bay and enjoy the experience. The trip was astounding. The main hallucinatory effects lasted near on 10 hours. 


7 hours after ingestion: my stomach was gumbling. I didn't feel unwell, but rather I felt as though I was digesting some large meal that I had just eaten, but without the bloated feeling... When I went to the toilet I found that everything flowed easily out of me. 


9 hours after ingestion: I’m feeling tired but happy. I am able to laugh and enjoy the light visual distortions that flicker across my vision. The sun is low in the sky and the colors are so vibrant that they make me glad to be alive... And sane again! Ha!


The visual effects were still very beautiful and everything seemed to sparkle for the next few days.  Felt a bit blue a week after, but still I was able to relate and function easily within social encounters, etc…


A month later, under  extremely  similar conidtions as before (i.e. geographical location, with the  same friend making observations and offering support, in a near enough emotional state as before) I orally consumed 800 µg of "bromo-benzodifuranyl-isopropylamine" hydrochloride salt in solution.  Having done research with some friends and with sources on the net, I found that this is good dose to start with. The main effects were not felt till well after two hours post ingestion.


Three hours after ingestion I began to feel some of the initial effects. A subtle and slow euphoria creapt up from my stomach though to my head. It was a very clean feeling. This reminded me very much of my experience with 2CB, except the onset of the effects were intensifying very rapidly now.


Four hours after ingestion. I’m feeling an intense and yet pleasant sensation of euphoria. Quite a lot more than what I originally felt an hour ago. I have a MDMA/2CB like taste in mouth. My vision is slightly estranged and colours are intensified. I feel very calm. The grass under my feet is LUSHLY green and soft, the air is cool, and the sunlight is pure warmth… Rather than feeling connected to the universe around me, I feel very detached, sort of like an out of body experience. Having said this, I am very lucid and able to perform tasks such as writing, typing and drawing with relative ease. I am able to talk to my friend and relay my experiences with relative ease…


Seven hours after ingestion. Wow. I’ve left planet earth. While I am experiencing visual hallucinations, these are no way near as intense as with “D-isolysergic acid diethylamide”. Rather they are very much like mescaline and have a soft less liquid flow to them. These undulating perceptual distortions sometime warp my perception of time when moving from one area/position to another. I’m still able to view my surroundings and explore the world around me. However it seems as though time has slowed down and my reactions take longer than normal. I feel very very detached from my body. Odd, and yet pleasant, it doesn’t feel real… My friend assures me that I’m pretty normal apart from my pupil dilation.


Nine hours after ingestion. I’m still experiencing this strange detached hallucination. However, I’m feeling as though I’m very aware, like I’ve just had a cup of coffee. We’ve moved the speakers from the sound system into the garden and I’m listening to The Orb. Awesome! Music is very vivid. Dancing is great and it seems as though I’m very aware and able to control my movements.


Thirteen hours after ingestion. The sun is setting… Colours are just beautiful. My thinking and reasoning abilities are very together still. Everything is good.


Sixteen hours after ingestion. I’m feeling somewhat tired and peaceful. My head is still detached from my normal position. Not feeling quite as refreshed and clear as after “D-isolysergic acid diethylamide”. My head is pounding a bit and I’m feeling like I’ve definitely taken a drug of some sort.


The following day, I’m feeling slow and lethargic in comparison to normal. Not quite there at work today. Didn’t learn anything new from the experience. No insight or head twisted visionary experiences were there to keep me entertained. I was more like Ecstasy i.e. a recreational drug that would probably be really good fun to dance on at a party. 


Conclusion


My experiences with “D-isolysergic acid diethylamide” and “Bromo-benzodifuranyl-isopropylamine” were radically different from each other. In my personal opinion these experiences both highlight the difference between a “phenethylamine” and a “lysergamide” trip. “Bromo-benzodifuranyl-isopropylamine” is very much a hallucinogen of potent effect, which is unusual in the class of phenethylamines. It’s effect (in my humble opinion) is very similar to mescaline. It's effects seem to have a prolonged duration on the mind frame and are more subtle.


While it is really hard to compare the effects of these two potent hallucinogens, I still find the effects of “D-isolysergic acid diethylamide” very much more of a shock to the system. It’s ability to completely dissolve my conscious train of thought, distort and play with my perceptual data in monstrous ways, and so produce illusions that can sometimes seem so terrifyingly real that I actually believe them for a brief time, is just unprecedented. It is the only hallucinogen that really provides me with a sense of awe at the existence of life and its interconnectedness on this planet (and on a universal level). It’s visual patterns are amazingly vivid and textured, and change continuously from second to second. 


“Bromo-benzodifuranyl-isopropylamine” on the other hand, simply doesn’t tear me apart like a good dose of "D-isolysergic acid diethylamide” does. I still find myself able to function normally and don’t seem to get any really deep insight into who or where I am. It’s simply a nice feeling accompanied by a slightly warped view of the world. Great for a slightly psycheldelic energy drug. If I was asked to state my prefered psychedelic “phenethylamine”, I would have to go with "mescaline". In high doses (750 mg or more) it is truely almost as mind bending as "D-isolysergic acid diethylamide". The patterns are lovely and clean and when the main effects fade away after 24 hours, you're left wondering if you ever actually took anything in the first place... With “Bromo-benzodifuranyl-isopropylamine” I definately felt as though I was coming down from a chemical effect.


Having had this experience, if any one came up to me and said that “D-isolysergic acid diethylamide” and “Bromo-benzodifuranyl-isopropylamine” are very similar, I could only deduce that they might not have either taken real “D-isolysergic acid diethylamide” or “Bromo-benzodifuranyl-isopropylamine”. To make my point, I have been using “LSD” (that I have acquired on the Black Market) for over 15 years now and had never actually had as good a batch as the one from my recent experience (of “D-isolysergic acid diethylamide”) until only about five years ago. Whether this is because of the very unstable nature of “D-isolysergic acid diethylamide's” chemical structure, or simply because the chemical synthesis of this potent hallucinogen is not what one would call “a walk in the park” (you’d need to be a damn good organic synthesis chemist to get good results), I am unsure.


In my humble opinion, “D-isolysergic acid diethylamide” is still by far my favourite hallucinogen ("mescaline" next, with "mushrooms" in third place and "DMT" in fourth) and still provides the most potent and vividly mind bending experience that I have ever had the pleasure of embarking on.


I am also very interested in hearing back from anyone else who has had the chance to compare and contrast the effects of these two chemicals. Please do feel free to E-mail me...


N.B. A note as to the reason why there might have been discrepancies between the so called “European” and “American” batches of “Bromo-benzodifuranyl-isopropylamine”. “Bromo-benzodifuranyl-isopropylamine” has a stereocenter and the D isomer is the more active compound. If one produced more of the lesser active isomer in their synthesis, then it is obvious that the dose needed to have effect would be higher.

LysergicWindow, Hofmann says in LSD; My Problem Child that D-isolysergic acid diethylamide is inactive in doses up to 500 ug, and Sasha writes in TiHKAL that it's inactive in doses up to 4 mg (!). 


I wonder if the substance you're describing might have been something else?

For everyone's amusement, I have drawn up all of the possible dragonfly analogues of DOM/2C-D.

Interesting, MGS.  Thanks!


Out of curiosity, as I only know what I've learned here about organic chemistry, are benzofuranyl rings a special case structure, or is it also possible to make, for example, chlorofuranyl, iodofuranyl, and so forth?

Yes.  As you can see, for the alpha position I put, R = H or CH3.  If it was DOM, it is CH3, and 2C-D is H.


Xorkoth, what do you mean?  Where on the furan rings would you put those halos?

Interesting, I'll have to open up a another tab to compare to 2C-D, and DOM to fully gasp it, but I actually understood this time lol.


MGS this would make both substance more potent, possibly by a lot right? If I understand correctly bromo-dragonFLY is "benzofuranyl" version of 2C-B? It became more potent, so I'd imagine these would do the same...or is my basic train of thought off lol?

^^ Hell, I don't know.  Like I said I'm not educated in organic chemistry at all, not even a little bit other than what I read here).  I was just thinking of the fact that you can attach benzene, iodine, chlorine, etc to a variety of phenethylamine types, and I saw the **benzo**furan and wondered if it was similar.  I may (and probably am) just babbling to someone who is educated in organic chemistry like yourself.

That's not what I meant, no.  But I can see that my idea makes no sense, so nevermind. ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)


EDIT: Ah, I understand now... in my haste I confused benzo- with bromo-.  Which are obviously not the same!  I was thinking it was a bromofuranyl ring.  It was a case of word confusion due to not looking over the material enough before speaking (posting).

The DFLY's do not interest me, but the FLY analogues of the 2Cs could be where the magic is at (for me.)  Of course, I am basing all of this on the small number of reports available on 2C-B-FLY (and the fact that Ms, Shulgin calls it a favorite of hers).  What I like is that it does not last for 24 hours (kiss of death for me).


If I had my wishes, I would love to try 2C-D-FLY and the two hemi-FLY analogues of it.

Actually I'm a lot more excited about the fly analogues as well.  I've tried 2C-B-fly a few times and each was wonderful.  Subtle, but magical.  I mixed it with LSD once which was good but difficult and uncomfortable (although I was in a surprise social situation as well and was heavily dominated by the LSD).  The last time I was able to use it, I had an awesome experience, a +3 which was not intense in the usual way but was extremely intense emotionally.  It was the first time I was opened fully to the cosmic love I've since explored a lot and found a permanent connection to, and it was perhaps the most euphoric I've ever felt from anything.  I felt perfect for weeks and could not stop talking for that entire time.  I was so inspired!


I would absolutely **love** it if someone synthed or somehow let me sample all of the 2C-X-fly substances.  I am especially interested in 2C-D-fly and 2C-E-fly.  And after I finally try 2C-P, I will probably also want to try 2C-P-fly.  2C-B-fly was much smoother and more organic than 2C-B, and also a lot more subtle and it seemed that a bad trip on it alone would have been literally impossible.  Plus, as an added advantage, the "tr1p-ballz" types would not like them (at least 2C-B-fly anyway) because it's so not in-your-face or intoxicating.

DOI is the shit. In my book, LSD is still #1. But a close 2nd goes to MDA or DOI. Not that MDA is incredibly deep or anything...but taking a really high dose gets mad intense. Electronic mushrooms, indeed.

Myself and 3 others unwittingly ate 2 blotters each with 1400 mics of definate Bromo-Dragonfly on them making a whopping 2800 mics. I have never tripped like on that before. I thought I was living in this strange village where I could interact with the characters there. I could smell their joints, hold slight conversations, At one point I thought it was three days later and that I had been tripping for 3 days (in fact it was still saturday about 6 hours into the trip) I thought it was time to go to the gym for my body tone class. There I was in the class thinking what the hell am I doing here in this state. I was sure the instructor would suss I was away with it. I saw it in his eyes, He knew something was up with me, Then I saw a blotter motive on his bum-bag. Eh?? I just got these trips I thought and scott (the instructor) has them already??? Next thing he is in the imaginary village selling trips to the rasta's heads in there. he was dishing them out saying "I got the Ones, The Twos OR The Three's, I got the Flashing Fives" and there was flashing stars coming off his trips. All the people were huddles around him buying his trips. This is just one example of one trip I had during 2 days of vivid hallucinations. Anyone who says bromo-dragonfly is lame wnat there head looked at. I was so glad when I awoke on the monday and it was over. In a nutshell, The best trip I ever had,  But what an ordeal.

My circle has had various tests between 800ug up to 5mg.  Said person who took 5mg said they experienced trails that stayed in their visual field for minutes at a time.  It does not have any of the "depth" i particularly look for in a psychedelic.  But they all have their place.

> To make my point, I have been using “LSD” (that I have acquired on the Black Market) for over 15 years now and had never actually had as good a batch as the one from my recent experience (of “D-isolysergic acid diethylamide”) until only about five years ago. Whether this is because of the very unstable nature of “D-isolysergic acid diethylamide's” chemical structure, or simply because the chemical synthesis of this potent hallucinogen is not what one would call “a walk in the park” (you’d need to be a damn good organic synthesis chemist to get good results), I am unsure.

Lysergic Window, I'm confused as well.  You seem to equate pure LSD with D-iso-LSD.  That was quite a post to not have the right chemical.  Are you sure you didn't try pure D-LSD?

Serioulsy read that shit, there seems to be a HUGE variance in dose from batch to batch, and from person to person. Just because a drug is active in micrograms, doesnt  imply that it is good![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif)

the reason behind the variance in dosage is due to some batches being the saturated compound white others are the unsaturated.

the unsaturated compound (iirc) costs more, and is more pleasent, less body load and more potent. most ppl though got the saturated compound since it was cheaper and more readily available.

*EDIT*

another reason for variance in dosage is the different optical isomers have differnt potency (like with almost all other optically active compounds).

the first company to sell the dob-fly sold only the R-isomers which is the potent one, while later on rcemic mixtures have apeared lowering potency to quite a large extent

The "saturated" compound you mention, which I assume is the tetrahydrobenzo[1,2-b;4,5-b']difuran, is **NOT** the same comound as the "unsaturated" fully aromatic benzo[1,2-b;4,5-b']difuran counterpart.  Br-Dfly (aka DOB-Dragonfly) is fully aromatic and has 3 x the potency of the DOB-Fly.  


There should be a thread to clarify this fact, because there seems to be a massive amount of confusion, not to mention those that are claiming to have taken something on blotter, when they really have absolutely no idea of the identitiy.

Okay, some of this was cleaned up.  I know there remains nonsense in here, especially with regards to dosages on blotters.  I put a disclaimer at the top of the thread to reflect this.  But at the moment, at least*** I*** am unclear as to what presented here is accurate and what is not.  So let's proceed with discussion then.

Thanks Xor. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png) 


As far as I'm aware DOB-Fly has not been marketed, but Br-DFly (aka DOB-Dragonfly) has.  Also, there have been no confirmed reports of either being found on circulating blotter.  My suggestion is to delete all posts referring to ingestion of Br-Dfly on blotter, unless it was obviously put there by the subject himself. 


Maybe there should be a Big & Dandy w/ a few clarifications at the top to avoid confusion ... although filtering of unfounded Br-Dfly blotter reports will still be necessary.

If you watch microgram, the dea newsletter, they have not encountered dob-dfly, most of the blotter purported to be bromodragonlfy was DOB, DOI, or DOC.

Hi Lux,


Yes... I am glad someone is on the ball. This was also brought to my attention by a friend of mine reading the report. When labeling a dilution series for experiementation in our lab, it is common practise to use the abreviation "Iso" in italics before the chemical name, to denote that the compound under investigation has varying "Isomers". This is something we have adopted doing, as in past we have found drastic discrepancies between experimental data when supposedly using the same chemical compound, and then found that the results were due to use of the wrong isomer... Admitedly a mistake on my part for including this abreviation in the report... My apologies.


The chemical I consumed in my "study" was the D Isomer of "Lysergic Acid Diethylamide" (or as it is writen on the side of the container it came in, "N,N-diethyl-D-lysergamide"). It was not "D-isolysergic acid diethylamide"...


Thanks for picking that up...


To further add to my observations... I have had the fortunate chance to have another experience with "bromo-benzodifuranyl-isopropylamine" OR "Bromo DragonFly". This time I consumed a 1.6 mg dose. The effects were very different from (what I will call here) my last journey. Again, good weather, my trusty friend and the same geographical location were used for my experience.


1 hour after ingestion. I noticed the mild onset of symptoms. First time around I thought these might be a result from anticipation of the drugs effects. This time, I am sure they are from the drug.


2 hours after ingestion. I came up very quickly. I'm actually quite nervous as I'm losing my ability to communicate - something which didn't happen last time with 800 µg.


3 hours after ingestion. The effects have totally distorted my grasp on reality/normal experience. What actually went through my mind over the next 16 hours is a complete mystery to me. I'm not saying I blanked out, but trying to arrange the sequence of events in a time line of order is impossible. Reminds me of ketamine. Several days after the experience I had a chance to sit down with my friend and discuss the sequential order that things occured in.... We disagreed on a lot of things... For example: I thought I went for a swim in the pool almost immediately after the onset of the effects and seemingly remember the sun shinning down on me during this experience. It was hot, so I figured a dip in the pool would chill me out. However, according to my friend, I didn't go near the pool till the early evening, which was almost about 10 hours after ingestion, when the sun was setting. 


To add to this, I vividly remember having quite a coherrent conversation with my friend (I'll call him "A" from here on in) about what experience actually is i.e. as all life is comprised simply of chemicals that are made from atoms, which are born in the heart of stars, then consciousness is purely a by product of the chemical reactions between the different components of star dust within our bodies... And so I became very aware that I didn't possess a soul. Rather I was aware that I AM a soul, that is made from the heart of stars, and I burn brightly in all I do, experiencing only the here and now, watching & witnessing the birth of future generations in the vast furnaces of the heavens above. "A" however eluded to me after that we only babbled about the beauty of nature i.e. the color of the flowers, the amazing depth to the sensation of touch while holding their petals, etc... At no time did I discuss the idea of what consciousness actually is with him!?!?  


There are also some other very unusual aspects that I'd like to bring to light about my experiences so far with this chemical. While I do definately get a rather unpleasant"chemical" feeling with the hallucinatory effects (something I don't get with "D-lysergic acid diethylamide" or "mescaline"), I have noted that 24 hours after ingestion (when the psychedelic effects have almost faded back to my normal base line of experience) I have found hightened and sporadic moments of insight into my normal experiences i.e. conversations that I conduct with freinds, family and random people that I come into contact with... These so far have proved very accurate. I won't go into specifics, but I have acted impulsively on several of these insights and have found them (the insights) to be very accurate in bearing to the situation I found myself in... 


To add to this... While I do not have any of the "icky" chemical feelings anymore, I do have a better and more profound understanding of who, what and where I am. While I do get this after doing both "D-lysergic acid diethylamide" or "mescaline", these profound effects don't seem to stretch into my normal consciousness beyond several days. However, with "bromo-benzodifuranyl-isopropylamine" these insights are still strongly dominant in my everyday experiences...


I will write more when I get a chance.


Once again, thanks for picking me up on the "Iso"... Even us chemists can sometimes make mistakes. And it instilled a certain confidence with me about all your observational skills, rather than just simply being fiends (excuse the term, but I've met a few in my time). And you'll be glad to know that you're all rather good at your chemistry...


Oh, and nanobrain... Using character profiles makes me wonder if you really work for the FBI? Nice gun you got there, by the way.

from what Iv read from tursted users here who have recieved lab samples it doesnt even seem to be that active in psychedelic effects, mroe or less just a psychedelic delierant with long lasting stimulation. Iv had teh oppertunity to aquire some but I passed do to what has bene posted by tursted users who I would suspect were telling the truth when they sampled it. And if I wouldnt do it, then you shouldnt either!!!


though I would stooked to hear from other trusted members who have tried it and actaly got worth while effects. The stories of it being anything somewhat plessant have all been from blotters, which would prob be DOB, and I find DOB to be enjoyable if you have the time. and I think satiticly the dosage seems to be ~800mic for "avarage" experience. if Im not misstaken those who ahve tried it from the lab have said taht it is inactive below (I think) 250micrograms. For the price, its not even that good of a compound to put on blotters, for 250mgs you could have 2.5 grams of DOB. 


also sense it has the same affinity for (forgot what receptor, it's posted here) that causes you to become anxious as it does for the 5ht2 I would also pass, but apparently so does dob or some what similer and I like taht... meh, I'll wait this one out untill ALOT mroe information is out there on the subjective experience.

I obtained 1mg of this a while back, and have yet to try it.  Someday I will though.  It sounds rather pleasant to me, if perhaps boring and too long.  One day when I have nothing to do but play outside I may take 250mcgs or something and see how it affects my day.


If and when I do, I shall surely post a report!

Just clearing up some more garbage:


1)  Shulgin's entry on bromo-dragonfly says:


"B-DFLY is active in man at about 100 micrograms i.m. administration."


2)  Ann Shulgin most certainly did not say that.  I was present at the Shulgin's lecture at the MindStates conference two years ago, and Ann did state something to the effect as above...but WRT 2C-B-fly, not bromo-dragonfly.  I highly doubt either of them ever bothered trying bromo-dragonfly, although of course that is supposition.

I had an experience which lasted over 36 hours of what was (supposedly) bromo dragonfly, it tasted bitter (beyond bitter) and the pungent taste could be felt in every cell of my body, heavy stomach problems, "dream"-like trances i would find myself in, confusion, and a kind of tweekish high, does this sound like a potential bromo-dragonfly experience to anyone. oh and the onset/comeup took a good bit over two or three hours.


Any clues? I know you can't be certain about this without a lab test.

Erowid mentions that there may have been two different "batches" of different potency floating around in the past.


Wikipedia mentions that:


"Bromo-DragonFLY has a stereocenter and R-(-)-bromo-DragonFLY is the more active stereoisomer."


Is it possible that the reported stronger batch was simply just the more active stereoisomer?


Also, how would the chemical name vary between the two? Meaning, what are the chemical names for both? If a product was labelled simply as "Bromo-benzodifuranyl-isopropylamine" I imagine you would not know which isomer (if not both) you had, correct?

**Bromo Dragon-fly? compare to??**


recently, I've been offered a to be part of a test group of experienced pychonauts, with this lovely and unknown chemical.


now i'm no stranger to pychodelic's 

lsd, mescaline,  shrooms, 

 all but a few of the 2c family.

and enough mdma to kill a dinosaur


have all been part of my history at different times, 

i try not to mix too many hallucinogens. mostly out of respect for the chemicals.

as i trip not only for the fun of it, but for the journey of discovery i tend to experience while on it.


i was wondering if anyone out there had some advice or knew of another psychedelic that i could use as a reference for the trip. so I'm not going it totally on guess work, and other people's reports. 


trip reports haven't really helped em much in the past since my experiences tend to be very obscure. 


thanks alot in advance.

Merged your question into our brand new Big and Dandy thread on this subject.  Perhaps someone will have some advice, but also please read through this thread as you may find some information, especially in the middle where some comparisons are made to LSD and other drugs.

I hope this post sheds a bed of light on the situation.


I recently became the owner of a small amount of bromo-dragonfly.


Using milligram scales, I weighed out 32mg. I wanted 30mg but seemed like too much hassle to try and put 2mg back. I mixed this into 300 drops (using a standard 10ml brown dropper bottle from a chemist) of vodka (smirnoff, for the record ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

You only used 300 drops (by the way a drop is NOT a consistent form of liquid measurement for 30mg, and you didn't bother to put the 2mg back?  That was awfully dangerous... considering that DOB-dragonfly's dose is in the micrograms!  I just want to know, why did you think that would be okay to do?  Do you realize how much variability in dosage you could have between drops?  In the future you should really use milliters... mix, say, 1mg per mL of water.  A milliter IS a standardized form of measurement and it's very easy to measure them with an oral syringe.  An example of why you should not use "drops" is this quote from your post:

Sounds you you didn't fuck up, but if you continue diluting and measuring potent psychedelics like this, you will someday end up getting into a bad place.


Thanks for sharing though.  I don't mean to criticize, but I wanted to point these things out to you, and primarily so others who come to read this won't think you should use "drops" as any form of measurement.  Check The [Liquid Measurement Thread](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/showthread.php?t=286239) for lots more information on why not to use drops, and how to properly use liquid measurement.

I can't help but feel you're over exaggerating the 2mg issue.


Assuming each drop is the same (which you say isn't, i need the check the thread you linked me to) the only difference the extra 2mg made is an extra 6 micrograms per drop. the stuff is strong but an extra 18ug isn't going to make much difference when you've taken 300.


this stuff isn't as strong as acid and people happily take 1000ug doses of that at once. i'm not suggesting people do the same with this as it's 'new' and no one knows potential for OD etc.


also, if drops are so bad, why is liquid acid so popular and why isn't everyone fucking up all the time? that's all done by drops (where i'm from anyway) - as common as blotter if not more so.


if i was (hypothetically) going to make a large batch of dragonfly i would do it in a ml measure if only to avoid the tedium of dropping 1000s of drops.


anyway i'm a bit busy now but will read the thread on liquid measurement when i get a chance. still can't help but feel it's being blown out of proportion. if there were big lumps of the stuff floating in the liquid then sure, someones going to suck the lump into the dropper and fuck themselves over, but it dissolved perfectly well.

I took 2800 mcg of bromo not expecting it to be so strong. We all thought we were eating acid and after 2 hours into a half a tab (800mcg) we desided the "acid" was not that strong. Oh lord if we only knew it was bromo and it takes about 3 hours to kick in properly.

We all nearly shit our pants.

My girlfriend took it really hard and was in tears for some hours.

I was just telling myself, "you stupid bastard" "deal with it!"

My other friend who had left was found in his boxer shorts standing in the middle of the road on his street staring up at the stars (it was frosty) He had been knocking on his old age pensioners door (in his kegs) asking her if she could hear "the imaginary" music? also stopping strangers in the street with the same question.

I was living in what seemed like a real imaginary village with various characters in there for hours. 

At one point I thought 3 days had passed and I had to go to the gym for my bodytone class. There we seemed to be me and my girlfriend and there was the full class and trainer. I was thinking Oh, no. What am I doing here in this state, What a mistake, Scott (the trainer) is sure to suss me out, Then I saw it in his eyes, "there is something wrong with that one" He thought and came over to confront me, It was then I saw an acid motive on his bumbag and thought to myself, Scott is ahead of the game this week, I have just got these Acid and he already has them, then I was back in the village and there was scott selling acid to all these head types. He was saying I got the ones twos OR the threes, I got the flashing fives and he was passing acid with flashing stas coming off them. 

Eating 2800mcg of bromo-dragonfly is not something I would like to repeat in a hurry. 2 days of real illusions. I dont know how I kept it together. I just had to deal with it.

Well, LSD is bit of a different case to most other psychedelics, as its dose-response curve is very linear.  In fact once you get over a certain level the receptors will be saturated and the strength of the trip will not increase.  And LSD has an extrenely safe physical effect compared to most other things (such as DOX/DOB-dragonfly), which become stronger and stronger as their doses increase and which have a real potential for OD.  Perhaps DOB-dragonfly is safer than DOB, but you *really* have to watch the dose with DOB, as it can become dangerous pretty quickly.


Anyway, I realize that the 2mg probably isn't a big deal since it's about 6 mcg per drop.  It's just on principle that I made this point because I believe that drops are a bad form of measurement for potent chemicals.  LSD is an exception somewhat because it's such a safe and forgiving material in the dosage department.  And drops of LSD solution are not all the same size either, which is why you get variability in the effects of a drop.


My other point about dosing drops of potent chemicals is that it can be easy to accidentally ingest two drops instead of one, or even more, especially if you're already tripping and it's dark and chaotic around you.  Taking two or more times your intended dose could have some pretty negative consequences.


Anyway, I get your points, but I still think it's a bad idea to dissolve into drops your potent chemicals.  For one thing, when you have a chemical dissolved into a solution it can change the viscosity of the liquid, which causes drops to be a different average size than the ones you put in thete originally.  Which gives you more or fewer drops than you expected.


You should read about the measurement with drop in the thread I linked to... it's an informative thread. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

@the guy who took 2.8mg...christ, glad to hear you're alright. don't think i'll ever take that much! 


yeh fair point about the overdose issue...my main worry is that i'll lose such a bottle and someone will find it and think it's acid, not an unreasonable assumption. i know some people who are very drop happy with acid and could get a nasty surprise - even just the longer duration might fuck someone over.


as for viscosity, even if the amount of drops changed by a whopping +/-10% (highly unlikely)...that works out as +/- 11ug per drop (in the 100ug/drop) depending on which way the change happened - still not going to make a massive difference, even with the steeper dosage response curve.


my gut instinct is that dragonfly is a lot safer than DOB...the DOx's i've done (B, I and C) have all had quite a body load and felt like a bit of a strain, especially the DOI. I think also the sheer amount of the chemical you take might have something to do with it. As I said in my original post on this thread, dragonfly feels like an ultra refined DOx and seems simply the fact you take so little makes the trip more comfortable. This is purely gut instinct though and not based on any science whatsoever ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


Anyway I hear your points about drops but they still seem by far the best distribution method to me short of putting it to blotter. I had to prat around using syringes and so on for measuring out DOC and DOI (it was dilluted so that 0.5ml was 1mg...wouldn't dissolve into drops) and it's just not practical and syringes aren't a good look in circles in hang out in. I recently discovered that DOC cant be made into 1mg-1drop using DMSO but that's another story for a different thread.


I'm tired and want to go to bed. the weekend has left me feeling pretty spaced but i don't know if that's from lack of sleep or the drugs...probably both. will try and get round to reading the thread on liquid measure tomorrow. cheers for the informative posts it's refreshing to talk to some people who actually have a clue rather than a load of myths or speculation.

**I'm planning to take Bromo Dragonfly, whats going to happen?**


A friend of mine gave me some bromo dragonfly as a present. 

not sure the dosage but he says its a perfect dose, considering I like things with that good psychedelic sense of humor and being trippy but not too far out!

Has anyone any experience with this substance?


What are the visuals like?

What are the risks?

How long before you come up/then down?

Bodily feeling?

Mental clarity?


I'd love to know what its all about before I fly with it, and what I might be in for.

the visuals are the most stunning I have ever seen although we were on a high dose. I was living in another world. It takes a good 3 hours to kick in properly and lasts a good ten hours followed by a long slow comedown. It felt quite comfortable considering the dose. I have solid memories of what I experienced although at the time I did not know what was going on really. I knew I had took a bit too much but I just told my self I had been silly and took too much and that I now had to deal with it. It was quite an ordeal lasting 2 days but looking back, It was the most amazing trip ever but I was glad when I had slept. I awoke and thought "thank fuck for that" Check some of my earlier posts in this tread more more trip details. 

Bottom Line: Well worth a go, Nice feel to it but lasts a bit too long for my liking. We thought we were taking Acid at the time. Found out later that it was Bromo-D.

**What I have found out so far**


^^nice input.


so far I have established that it takes a fair while to kick in, then peaks about 4-6 hours later after another 10 or so hours later you start to come down but are still mildly tripping. Roughly 20 hours after ingestion you might be able to sleep.


Effects are warping, swirly and moving images in the visual field. with some distinct "realish" seeming images/things occuring inbetween the warping stuff.

Do the visuals look better in daylight or night time?


Some people have reported scales of nausea rating from none, mild for an hour or so through to intense nausea throughout.

Do any of the posters on this board have any firsthand experience with nausea and bromo-dragonfly? or any kind of head or bodily discomfort for that matter?


Seeing as it lasts so long anyone any preferences on when in the day might be best to take it?


would this all seem accurate?

Day or night  did not come into the trip we had. We took it at 3pm on the sat and never slept until 10pm on the sunday. I have not heard of nausea on bromo. My girlfriend did lose the plot for a while and was crying her eyes out as the intensity was quite a shock when the payload kicked in. 

we did know what had hit us. I kept going "elsewhere" where I would think I was somewhere totally different. 

I saw rooms filled with the most magnificent gems and jewels. I saw scenes from robot wars year 4000ad. Proper amazing robots would come out the ground upon raised platforms inside an arena. One was based on Emeralds and showcased green lazers another was smaller in size and was like a chrome pit bull. this one had loads of saws and drills as weapons. Then the word came...."Fight!" and they went at it, I was in the arema watching in total awe. The emerald robot would fire a lazer and the pit bull would pop out a mirror and reflect the lazer back at the emerald one. at the same time the pit bull would be drilling and slashing with loads of different weapons. I never did see which one won the fight. Totally Amazing!! There was no question about handling the trip. I was just along for the ride and was in observe mode. I did not know who I was or anything. 

There was loads of people I uncountered along my way as well in "the Village" They would bamboozle me with amazing card tricks and do the most amazing grafitti before my eyes then run away with the wall they done the art on only to do another equaly amazing one. I thought I had been spiked with 1000000 acids.  I thought I was at a 2 week festival for a bit in europe and was with loads of imaginary people. and we had all been spiked. all totally in my head. I knew I had passed the peak when the card tricks were only 6 foot across instead of 8 foot and the grafitti was not quite as stunning but still amazing. The maddest bit was when I thought I had to go the gym for my keep fit class. I tell of this bit in an earlier post. 

A major part of the trip was caused because

Somebody had rang my phone and if unanswered it makes a beep noise  every 4 minutes or so to remind of a missed call. We could not find the phone for about 8 hours. The beep thing was driving us insane. Really getting to us. At one point I thought suicide was the only option to escape the beep but I then thought I would proberbly get trapped in limbo for eternity with the beep. I kept trying to launch searches for the phone but it was hopeless. as soon as I started to look the bromo would take over. I would only get as far as looking under one cushion before I saw myself pulling a chain out of the ocean which I knew had the phone on the end. I pulled and pulled  then the end of the chain came with the phone on it but it was encased in a block of ice and could not be turned off. Then I was given 3 options or doors, behind 1 door was the phone ready to be turned off fair and square, behind another door would be the prospect of having to listen to another 1000 beeps before getting another chance, The third fate would mean waiting until the ice melted. I thought pick that door, I opened one and a brick wall dropped, blocking that one.  Then at the same time, the phone went "Beep!" It was a right head doer. The beep started getting all eeire and echo like it was beeping for beyond. 8 hours of beep hell. then all of a sudden I just had the phone in my hand turned it off then realised the beeping had stopped then realised I had the phone. Where had it been?? I did not get the satisfaction of finding it. I really wanted to know as well. we were trying all ways to locate it. My girlfriend thought she was talking on the phone to her mother who would tell us what direction the beep was coming from. (on the phone) she was shushing me saying "listen for the beep mam and tell me which direction it is coming from". This conversation was with nobody as her mother was not even on the phone. I saw poeple getting on planes and the phone would fall out there pocket at the last second and the plane would take off thus losing the phone. It was hopeless. 

When my girlfriend lost it completely, It took me 3 hours to get 1 word out of her. She was a wild untame animal. It was a slow recovery for her. she thought me and my friend (Who had to get away) we conspiring against her and had to be restrained a few times. I thought the police had the house surrounded and all my family were there to negociate with me. I could go on and on. 

I would not take that dose in a hurry again (2800mics) we were reckless and got taught a lesson.

(Slightly offtopic) Last night I dreamt that I was exploring this compound.

Very strange as it never appealed to me, nor would I know how to obtain it.

Quite detailed (up to afaik correct chemical structure and whatnot) and long dream too.

Weirdness. 

I may be willing to try this one now.

oh and thus far I havent seen anything that would make me willing to try it yet. all of the people I would trust havent taken there samples yet!!!


GET TO IT!!!! PLEASE!!!!!! the world could greatly learn from your experience rather then (we took what we thought was acid but turned out to be brmdrgfly) HOW THE HELL DO YOU KNOW THAT??!?!?!?! did you ahve teh blotters tested? how did you know the dose? did you call up a chem supplier thinkng you where getting LSD but they called you back and told you "yeah my bad, it was bromodragonfly" and the other guy who took his in "drops" Why do I have a hard time believing that one?

(Personal attacks are uncalled-for.)

I know fine well it was not LSD, Dob, Dom but in fact Bromo-Dragonfly. At the time I did assume it was LSD but found out later otherwise. You can buy bromo from RC Companies. Plain and simple.

I was sold them as "trips" and assumed they were acid. The duration even at low dose sharp contridicted that notion as it was like 18 - 20 hours. I asked the person who gave me them if this was not LSD but in fact a RC such as DOB? (I also told him I was not complaining, Just curious to know what the fuck it was) He replied, DOB, It is definitly not and he said he would find out exactly telling me he knew the guy had been working with bromo-d. 3 days later me mailed me and confimed what he already thought, It was if fact Bromo-Dragonfly as well as confirming to dose, 1400mics. On the ones he warned me not to take more than 2 of, SO THERE!!!

This bloke I know has since purchased Bromo from an established RC Company and it is one and the same as the first ones. 


(Ditto).


Chill, bro. No need to take a tone w/people, being unsure of the chemical in question is a very big issue in this thread and generally, i.e., have a look at page one. And cut it with the SWIM, it's obnoxious. --SomeKindaLove

and the other guy who took his in "drops" Why do I have a hard time believing that one?[/QUOTE]


Because you must be a "Doughting Thomas" who has no idea about bromo-d but thinks he know everything about everything, So all us people who he knows nothing about who HAVE actually experienced this very worthwhile compound cant know what they are talking about.

People HAVE taken this and they know what they were taking. I learned the truth later on, As I made a polite enquiry.

Obviosly the other person you are calling a lier, Simply Diluted his Bromo-D powder with alcohol or something and hey presto!! He has drops. That does not sound THAT far fatched to me. 

You are proberbly one of those peole you somtimes hear about who get stung with a blank acid and run about thinking they at Disneyland tripping their heads off and go back the next day for more, Much to the rip artists bemusment.

Listen man, quit this crap.  next time you attack someone it's a warning.


What makes you think Youkai doesn't know what bromo-dragonfly is?  He was just concerned about the identity of what you took.  It's an important issue.  Perhaps he approached it in a bad way, but there are better ways to reply. ![:|](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eyesclosed.gif)

pssst, an effective dose of 2cb is only 25mg.  That's pretty small, if you've ever seen 25 mg.  Absorbed by blotter, you could get that on a 4-square.

Bromo-dragonfly was a trip like no other. It was very unlike Acid. It changed me for life in a small way. I beleive 100% it was Bromo, that is why I listed my post in the Bromo thread and not in the "All trippy RC's what people dont know what they are taking thread"

I dont like being called a lier or a fool who knows not what they say, (although I must admit I have fell under this definition upon occasion)

But not this time. It WAS Bromo-D. Why would the guy Lie? Why is the RC stuff obtained much later labled Bromo-D the same thing?

I will still stand that no one Id trust has actualy taken the compound. 


And I find it funny that you wouldnt include how you knew it was brmdrgfly untill someone questioned you. Maybe you did maye you didnt but absed on your behavior and how you went about explaining it makes me still chalk your experiences as either a pipe dream of a case of someone taking unknown blotters and convensing them selves it was brmdrgfly. 


you all can get as mad as you want with me, if you realy did take brmdrgfly then charish your experiences for your self not for me. Im simply stating that no evidence thus far have I found 100% trust worthy, it also ahs to do with track record. When Xorkoth takes his sample, I'll add that to my memory bank. As well as a few other trusted users of this board. Again, dont get mad at me because I dont trust you fully, anyone can claim anything and its up to us as researchers to put faith only in those we deem to be trustworthy beyond any reasonable doubt.

This thread is about sharing ones experiences about the given compound. If you trust nobodys judgement or knowledge, why bother reading the postsat all, unless you trust the author.

A pipe dream, It definitly was not.

Ask FB or B9 if I am a dreamer. They both know me well emough to vouch for my credibiliy. I may not the expert on everything that a lot of people on bluelight are but I would not just post something like that for sake of it. 

I can appreciate, It may sound a bit far fetched and exagerated to some people, but please belive me, this was how it occured in my mind, The post did not even do the experience justice. What makes you so sure I took something other than what I beleive to be bromo?

It was not 2c-b either. I know what 2c-b is. 

I took the first guys word in good faith. He went out of his way to find out exactly what was used. 

He said The Guy apologised saying he thought nobody would tell the difference between acid and what it was which he admited was bromo-Dragonfly. This was later backed up be a RC Company product in comparison, Unless the RC company does not know what they are on about either?

Okay, guys, enough. This could go back and forth forever. The point here is about trust. There is much to be said for not trusting random people on the internet but also, until these drugs are legal and come with little manufacturer's inserts and there is a psychedelic PDR, we'll never really be able to fully know any other way. In any event debating this on the Internet is utterly pointless. 


Feel free to hit me up PM with any concerns.

Weird developments in this thread. 

I'll refrain from remarking on the "treatment" gabba gets for no fucking reason from people I wouldn't trust with my dead dog, and with mod support to boot, but 

I'll just think it instead. 

Loudly.

Deafening.


As I said, consider this debate over. If you have concerns, drop me a PM. Ptah, you & I have corresponded before and we had good communication, don't think that's changed 'cause it says mod under my name now, but also don't think I'm going to defend the approach I take in a public thread. Gabba, I don't know you, and am not trying to give you shit, but your original reply was over the top. Also feel free to PM me. Youkai, same goes for you too. Period, full stop, end of story. Anyone and everyone feel free to PM me, but no more of this talk in this thread.


I don't want to be seen as playing favorites and I don't want hurt feelings. I am killing this conversation in-thread because I really feel like it is going nowhere quickly and people are just getting pissed at each other. If someone wants to be a skeptic, you'll never convince them over a message-board, and contrarily, they'll never convince anyone else that their own experience is invalid. The entire debate is just silly. The point about not knowing what you are getting is well-taken, but if someone feels there's ample evidence, then we should take them at their word, and if not, I don't think launching internet diatribes against each other is productive.

Doubting your word is not attacking you.  This is an example of a personal attack and comments like this and one that have been edited out are the reason I singled you out in my response:

That's just not necessary (and the edited ones were much more inflammatory).  Had you kept your responses to Youkai civil, you would not have been mentioned above him.  But don't get me wrong, I am considering all sides of this argument unnecessary and as such I hope that they stop.


So anyway, please don't think I was singling you out... it's just that you crossed the line into flaming.  No harm, no foul. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Last Weelend I was a young lad eat 5 tabs containing 500mics each of an unknown substance. Followed by anther 4 3 hours later, Cant say for sure what they were even though there was some bits of paper from some lab with all the specs and details stating it was something called Bromo-Dragonfly? I am not too sure myself. Anybody could print up such documents and make such wild claims. 

Anyway, He seemd of for a while then started to fuck up a bit walking around in circles in this guys 1 bedroom flat which was full of peole. I advised him to get a Taxi home shortly after taking the first 5 but he was having none of it. A few people tried to wind him up but I sort of kept an eye on him and sort of asked people to give him a bit space. He dealt with it well considering the dose but you tell he was gone at times. I did not see how far he went as I had to go. I cant understand peole who take so much of a compound which could be ANYTHING! especially against direct advice not to. It would have been 4500mics. Saying that is could have been Nutmeg or LSA what all I know, ![:-)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

gabbachris, Im sorry if I insulted you. I'll keep your experience stored away for comparison apon future experiences I happen across. My main concern as stated above is that you recieved blotter which you originaly thought was acid but turned out to be brmdrgfly. last I check almost all of erowids experiences start off like that and honestly they cant be trusted, erowids vault for it is pretty much useless besides some off sites litt about it. Same goes with many DOB reports, people just assume what they have is this or that without knowing for sure and then write a report as if what they took is in fact "that". These big and dandy threads on bluelight are prob the number 1 resorce on these esoteric compounds with little to no known reactions/effects in humans besides what is posted through personal experience. can you see why I am warry of posts claiming to have taken a compound which was on a hit of paper you bought from someone? It could have been anything, who knows what theoretical potent psychedelics have been custom synthed and put on to blotters (not claiming to know any, but Im sure its been done). 


It reminds me of the DOB thread I made, alot of people where posting experiences of DOB blotters which they "heard" where DOB through other people. while this can serve as something you may be able to compair against pure compound obtained through over seas labs, in reality it could have been any number of psychedelic amphetamines. As you said your self, the guy your guy got it from (I guess I read that right)? order brmdrgfly and pawned it off as LSD. These types of people already have a red flag from me on what they may or may not be doing. Hell, Iv been offered 5meo **apde** from some kid who swore up and down thats what it was and he ordered it off the net. Just because your in the know doesnt mean you actualy know ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


Im also aware that the chemical in question is available through many suppliers and has been for some time now, Im not doubting that you may have taken brmdrgfly Im doubting that you took it 100% doubt free. 


and to my deffense I stated that your post should be removed because you never gave a reason as to who/why/where you believed it was brmdrgfly only that you took tabs and thought it was acid and it turned out to be brmdrgfly. sounded REALY sketchy at first didnt it? 


I admit, I become a compative asshole when I dont have my daily doses and I may have went on without enough warrent.... 


**BUT**


for anyone else wishing to share details on tehre expereinces with brmdrgfly PLEASE include the sorce (not ******trading or what ever) but if it came from a lab, friend,   tabs, university.. what ever. or if you would rather not incriminate your self/possibly others just put  "verified" befor your experience so we all know that your sample did in fact come from a trusted sorce. 


If Im out of line then just delete this, but I think what Im saying has some bases in this discussion. 


Love.

I'd love to know what percentage of bromo-dragonfly user reports actually involve bromo-dragonfly.  I'd be willing to bet a good chunk of change that it's less than 20%, perhaps even less than 10%.

My report was defo about Bromo. A second batch was obtained from an oberseas people RC lab and the effects were the same so that prooves it. Please beleive me, Fair enough the first guy may have feeding me bull but I have since compared it with stuff from a lab with all the paperwork and it is the same stuff. Enough of this pettyness, I grow wearly of it. I wont suffer fools. Who was he to call me a lier? He based this on nothing.

Oh it was! I'm not going to go into detail  for obvious reasons, but I know both the BL who wrote that and the source of it and it def was dob-dragonfly. The only issue still in questio is whether it was the racaemic compound or one of the optical isomers. Maybe I could try the thing with polarized lenes, but it would only tell whether it was racaemic or not; if not I'd need to research the plane of rotation fo te S & R isomer (but I really can't be arsed: It's enough to know it was dob-dragonfly in one form or another)


Short of a chemical analysis (either pay for one or walk into a police station & let them do the analysis!), none of us really have any idea what the fuck we've taken unless you know the people making it

To make my point more clear:


I was not referring to any one particular post, least of all the report by gabbachris.  I do not doubt the reports from people who've bought this compound from a chemical vendor.  I myself have a couple milligrams of the stuff in cold storage (where it will likely stay for my lifetime) and feel reasonably certain that the analysis provided by the seller was genuine.  


But such reports only appear to make up a small minority of bromo-dragonfly user reports.  The vast bulk of them are from people who took some random blotter or liquid dose, and then later decided they must have taken "teh bromo-fly" based on reading the internet.  Never in my experience has there been such a fiasco of misinformation as that surrounding this compound.  The only thing I've heard of to rival it was the DOM/orange sunshine episode in the 60s.  Leather Lars and Bear Owsley should get together for some drinks sometime, no doubt they'd have a lot to talk about.

i have a question...


does bromo-dragonfly require any specific method of storage, other than obvious out of moisture, out of heat (higher than room temperature) and light?


had a look around the net but nothing much use came up, other than some people have kept it in the freezer to keep it out of harms way for sure

From what I have been told, Bromo-D is much more stable than LSD It does not degrade nearly as easy. I would still aim to keep it cool and dark as possible. But take my word with a pinch of salt as I am told I am not a trusted source of information, & I get my compounds mixed up.

this was exactly what we done when we first got some. we were told they were strong trips and dont take more than 2. We tried 1/2 and 2.5 hours later were laughing but at the same time saying how mild they were. "Sod The Half" was the critical moment and we took another 1 & 1/2. Not knowing about Bromo-d at all and the fact it takes about 3 hours to kick. We did not see it coming, We did not know what hit us. My earlier story tells some of the tale.

Wont be making that mistake again,

BRDF, tested, pure, unblottered. 


2-3mg ingested on a whim after said individual accidentally, stupidly, stupendously insufflated 30-40mg DOC from the wrong vial in the dark. the DOC, pure to be sure, active as all git in other primates at 1.75-3mg oral, and at this level a certain overdose, had the individual retreat to his tent to make peace with god and ask the gentle reader et al to forgive this stupid death, had...no effects on the psyche, induced significant kundalini tremors and periph. vasoconstriction but nothing worse than sticking your finger in a light socket for awhile..although it is still hard to explain how the tent was tarred and feathered on the inside in the morning when neither were present in the vicinity...


to make the long story short, the BRDF taken the next day, euro batch, in a somber bulletproof psychotic/thanatotic  finger dippin thumbprint lickin style did...nothing. though the acute alien presence of the chemical was felt on the body until bedtime 4 hours later.


one may draw certain conclusions from this inexplicable event inlight of the individual having neither psychedelic tolerance nor experience with either material.


i spose were he to drink the half bottle of highly concentrated liquid LSD, the valuable and extremely rare material, birthed of crystal pure, would be wasted unduly. 


sky was yellow and the sun was blue, nah, the road was green and a total 300k green line driving home in jammed traffic on both sides, while the lane chosen parted clear just in time, Red Sea style.


although how does one know whether he is really dead???

well, hard to tell anything without getting into too much rambling then.^

received a similar impression with the 2c-fly compound where a full dose was a full dose of a long lasting mellow feeling, in comparison to better known 2c's. 

on the other hand doses below 1mg were clearly perceptible the other day.

left me with the impression that the term psychedelic cannot be attributed to a certain substance.

^well, you know me and i'd never take anything i did not measure to within 2mg personally. but this was bizzare - no effect from an obvious overdose of DOC led to a persistent belief that i may have in fact moved on and no longer can learn from the space psychs offer. tested said theory w/the BRDF in a stoopid way. to no effect. 300mcg is active in humans. again, never tried either compound, nor had psych tolerance after months of abstinence.

That is the highest dose of DOC i have ever heard of being consumed (by a factor of two!) are you having trouble remembering the experience? I would really like to read a trip report, its amazing you can be so (seemingly) nonchalant...the realization that i had accidentally ingested 40mg of DOC alone would give me a heart attack! Not to mention  what it would feel like once the drug took effect. do you think you hit the 'saturation point' perhaps after then 15mg mark any increase in dose has little effect...unlikely but possible (i have heard about this with LSD, where dose dosent really matter with a finger print because you are hitting the saturation point i.e. all receptor sites are occupied by LSD molecules, is there any pharmacological evidence that this is possible (there are a finite number of binding sites.)

but this is clearly a very dangerous thing to do!

^^ nanobrain is saying that the DOC had virtually no effect.  My guess is astronomical tolerance.  I can imagine how one might reach that level of tolerance after years and years of frequent dosing.  During my worst periods of tolerance I could take 7-10mg of DOC orally and feel a nice amphetamine-like euphoria with light distortions (I mean light), and vasoconstriction, but no real trip.

There's enough anecdotal evidence to suggest the DOx's build tolerance MASSIVELY. They seem to really downregulate those HT2as.


MODERATION is key if you want to remain tripping once every few weeks.

So how dangerous do you guys think this drug could be. I always wonder about RC's and if they will end up giving people parkinsons or some crap in 5 years time ![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif) Seen as this is relativly new, unlike 2c-e and 2c-b, what sort of info is there and what can be known about it in health-hazard terms just from its chemical structure etc?

I'd hesitate to make any definite pronouncements but br-dfly is relatively close to DOB which is relatively close to DOM which has a reasonably long track record of being fairly safe; however, whatever the fent stuff was that was giving Parkinson's syndrome (MPPP? my memory is failing me) was "relatively close" to fentanyl....

yeah cause tbh i was kind of concerned when i read this:


> Because of the structure, it may turn out to be a bit iffy in the genetics dept. as I think the benzodifuran nucleus is the right shape/electronic configuration to interact with the DNA chain (not too bad, but acts as an intercalator - forms hydrogen bonds and sits inside the DNA chain)

effects rapidly multiplying cells? sounds fucking cancerous.

^^^^^

where did that info about DNA come from?


It would seem that there is a pretty clear correlation between duration of effects and degree of tolerance.


DMT>no tolerance

5-meo-dmt>no tolerance

salvia (a different receptor set, i know)>no tolerance

4-ho-dmt>"average" tolerance

DOC>massive tolerance

Br-Dfly>massive massive tolerance???


I would assume this tolerance is both a result of 5-HT downregulation, and psychological tolerance or habituation to the effects of a drug which gives you over ten hours to settle down and get comfortable.

argh! i have no tolerance to psychs, havent indulged in long time, never w/BRDF or DOC at all.


MDMA makes me go to sleep, no more of that for me, the only things still working are desoxy and mdpyrovalerone - oh, and the jah kind green. and dMT.

I have taken it..


VERY nice and intense visuals with little to no mind fuck.


My girlfriend spent the first half of the trip admiring the visuals but then throwing up every 20 or so minutes.. in the end of course she had nothing to puke so was dry heaving.. she also got this with 2ce.. (we are both on SSRI's.. me citalopram, her fluoxetine and i didn't get this with either chemical)..


Would definately do it again.

2.8mg was no mean feat either. Very rewarding (after it was over) but what an ordeal of visual distortion to say the least.

got a few mgs of this infamous BrDF but haven't ever even come close to considering ingestion. so many substances to try, so few timeslots that I have in my life now that allow me to ingest psychedelics and go with the flow.

**Hppd with Dob-dfly**


Hi im fairly new to this forum so apologies if this is not allowed.


I have been taking psychedelics for about 3 years starting with lsd and shrooms, then moving on to rc's.

I have enjoyed all my experiences with these substances with no regrets, except bromo-dfly.

In total i tripped 5 times on this substance with doses ranging from about 700ug to 1.5mg.

Now looking back 6 months after my last trip on it, i still have various hppd symptoms. 

This only happened after the bromo and was not brought on by anything else, i have tripped on lsd since and it has not affected my hppd.

Why i carried on taking bromo after my first trial, dont ask![:p](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png) 


Has anyone else experienced any long lasting effects after taking this specific substance? 

With the recorded deaths aswell, i just dont think this compound is safe.

I don't have any insight into the issue, but I would really like to hear more in-depth reports on the five experiences you had with BDFLY. If you feel like it, maybe type something up for the Trip Reports forum?

Well, what do you mean when you say "HPPD?"  Do you mean slight lingering visual effects, because those are quite common and usually resolve on their own if you take a break from psychedelic use.  Or do you mean that you experienced a panic attack after taking Bromo-DFLY and had a bad trip?  If you could describe your symptomatology it would be helpful.


Also, while I am a true psychonaut and have taken a bevy of uncommon psychedelic compounds, I would still be hesitant to try something like Bromo-DFLY, considering its potency, duration and entirely unknown safety profile.  If you want a psychedelic that is guaranteed not to be physically dangerous, it is best to stick with something like LSD (if you are lucky enough to be able to obtain it): the therapeutic ratio is incredibly high and toxic overdose is virtually unheard of.

It does seem that the 4-halo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine derivatives (well IMO) are the worst offenders when it comes to HPPD symptoms. |The one compound that left me with visual distortions etc and an occasional feeling of getting electric shocks was 2C-I. Nothing else has produced anything like that in a long history of using psychedelics


That this seems to have happened with DOB dragonfly actually comes as no surprise (esp with doses in excess of 1mg)...

I just got a sugar cube of DOB last week and am very wary to take it.

I think it's going to stay in my stash box for a fair while... Also worried as the guy said there's 1500 mcs on there but 2 drops enough for two people. I didn't think at the time to ask him whether he meant two doses of 1500mcs or 750 each.. *sigh*

My hppd consists of various different visual distortions, they are not constant but are very noticeable when they occur. Not suprisingly i find them very simular to the light visuals on the comedown of a dob-dfly trip. No i did not have a "bad" trip on any of my experiences, infact i found them all to be extremely neutral, with not much shift in emotion at all. 


I think its safe to say i wont be doing dob-dfly again any time soon, as it seems the the risks far outweigh the benefits. But i will write up a trip report on my higher dose experience soon as tobala suggested if anybody is interested![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

YEAH, baby! ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)


Might I suggest a short summary of the difference in effects between, say, a 750 mcg experience and a 1,500 mcg one--maybe at the end of the high-dose TR you are planning? That would be awesum, d00d...

Well, the compound in this thread is **DOB-dragonfly**, a moderation of the **DOB** molecule which seems to vastly change effects and potency. You should try to ascertain which you have by asking your supplier.


I haven't yet tried this one, and doubt I will. It seems too....crap? Perhaps thats the word I'm looking for. Maybe one day when I'm older and greyer....Plus I am wary of these reports of American and European versions- thats odd. Can anyone shed light on that?

I forgot about the benzodifuran nucleus being a DNA intercalator (they fuck up the DNA transcriptase by causing a 'lump' in the DNA molecule so that the transcriptase enzyme is halted in its tracks).


For an analogy, imagine the benzodifuran as being a drop of superglue in a zipper representing the DNA double chain - zip will only unzip so far then is stopped. I think that's pretty much decided for me that I'll pass on this one & will just have to imagine its effects from others trip reports

You mean the two double bonds (which aren't aromatic!) are of "good" distance to each other as to be able to alkylate together DNA parts?


Like Hexane, metabolized in human body to the diketon which then glues together histidine(?forgot which part) parts of the DNA.

Sorry, bunch of questions here, but I found this really interesting.


I was trying to look up more about benzodifurans being DNA intercalators, but I couldn't find any DNA intercalators that had a benzodifuran nucleus in it.  Does anyone have any links or anything with more information on this?


The benzodifuran part would flatten the molecule out (right?), which is one of the reasons it would be more potent, but flat molecules are more likely to be DNA intercalators.  Tell me if anything I've said so far is wrong, haha.


If DOB-Dragonfly is in fact a DNA intercalator, it would then probably be a mutagen / possible carcinogen?  I wonder if 500mcg to 1mg would really being enough to do anything?


The amount is so small, yet I guess there are a lot of molecules in there to interact with DNA, so who knows...  If anyone has any answers to any of my questions I'd be much obliged.  Thanks!

would all fly, hemi-fly, and dragon-fly compounds have the capacity to cause DNA intercalation. I'm thinking of 2c-b-fly specifically. what benzodifurans have been demonstrated to have this property, and how far of a structural jump is it to dob-dfly?

^ only the fully aromatic nucleus ie the dragonflies. Things like 2C-B fly don't as the intercalation is dependant upon aromatic pi electrons being able to get inbetween the complimentary base pairs and interact with them

> Click to expand...


Yep any aromatic ring, or group of aromatic rings is is going to be totally planar & that's a very important factor in the SAR of 5HT2a agonists (LSD is almost planar due to the conjugated spi electrons from the indole nucleus right up to the carboxylic acid group (because one of the tautomers behaves like the enol form of a ketone) being like a backbone preventing any of the rings 'flipping) out of the plane (trying to form a boat or chair conformation

Mostly inyercalators just stop the transcription of DNA to messenger RNA, which is eventually 'decoded' into a protein. In most cases it'd not be a problem unless it sits in the region that eventually becomes a protein used by the immune system or similar which detects & destroys pre-cancerous cells. Mutagens & carcinogens are more compounds that cause mistakes to be made in reproducing the DNA during cell division as that mistake is then transferred to any cell derived from that one original cell with the fucked up/incorrect reading base pair

I don't think that a one-off dose of 750-1000 ug of bromo-dragonfly is going to produce a clinically-relevant suppression of DNA synthesis.  But for anyone worried, there might be a bright side:


Viano *et al* (1985). Biological properties of benzodifuran derivatives. *Drugs Exp Clin Res.* **11:** 865-7.


The antiviral activity and the effect on DNA synthesis of two benzodifuran compounds were studied. DNA and some RNA viruses were significantly inhibited by concentrations ranging from 15 to 30 nM/ml. The inhibition of DNA synthesis in host cells was obtained with concentrations higher than those inhibiting virus replication. A favourable ratio between antiviral activity and inhibition of DNA synthesis of the host cells is present in these compounds. This activity is substantially due to the ability of the compounds to complex with DNA.

I'm not sure I'd be too worried about the toxicity, after all the Shulgins had tried 2c-b-fly and not yet developed cancer (but maybe the 2c-b-dfly is more dangerous?).  I think there's probably a lot more cancer causing compounds in barbequed food or cigarette smoke (but maybe we're unlucky and we'll all die of some weird cancer in a couple years).  I tried 2c-b-fly years ago a couple of times and I'm still living cancer free.

Well, if I understand it right, 2c-b-fly isn't aromatic (like 2c-b-dfly or DOB-dfly) so it wouldn't be a possible DNA intercalator.  


I agree that 1mg probably wouldn't even be close to a big deal.  It's still interesting though, and something to take into consideration.  I guess you never know what you're getting into when you take a unresearched compound.


Thanks for the reply Fastandbulbous.   SAR is the stuff that made me get interested in the world of RCs, so that kind of information is always interesting to me.

Alright, I just looked up the article for you.  Here is the link.


[http://ltarkiv.lakartidningen.se/2008/temp/pda34918.pdf](http://ltarkiv.lakartidningen.se/2008/temp/pda34918.pdf)


I hope I'm allowed to post that, especially since it's in the spirit of harm reduction.  Now those are some disturbing pictures in that article.  I'm going to try and use an online translator to read it, but I'm really interested a real translation.


Dear god those pictures look bad...


Edit:  Well so far, I'm through half the article really poorly translated.  Not incredibly useful so far because there has been no information on how much was taken.  I believe it was a 35 year old man who went over to his friends place.  They both took Bromo-DFly that they had obtained from the internet.


The one guy was found dead, other has no memory of the event but was able to walk.  Was in the hospital for a couple of days and they gave him some benzos and a bunch of other poorly translated medications I can't understand to try and stabilize him.  Low blood pressure and other things I guess.  He still had really bad "vasospasm" which I think means vasoconstriction.


They gave him three vascodilators and a couple other things that didn't translate well, but none of them had much effect.  He was in the hospital for 9 days by this point, and by the 10th day he could go to some sort of "hemodialys" unit and out of intensive care.


7 weeks after it became neccasarry to amputate his fingers off his left hand and he still had gangreen in two toes on his left foot.  That's all I've gotten through so far.


I think we can say that Bromo-Dragonfly has vasoconstrictive properties... hmm...

I'm reading through the discussion right now and it was verified as Bromo-DFly through urine sample.


This is also important:


"It is not well-known how big dose it hit occupied, but according to letters to the editor on Internetforumet Flashback learns he and his friend have done a miss assessment off the amount, with a grave overdose that consequence"


It also says there was another person who overdosed by taking 2.5-3mg and was hospitalized, but fully recovered.


I don't quite understand this part, but it says that the vasoconstriction is probably caused by prolonged stimulation of the "alfa-1" receptor.  A DOB overdose a similar thing but was fixed by Tolazoline.


That's everything of interest I think.  That's my interpretation from an online translator, so it could be slightly off.

Keep in mind that DOB itself has vasoconstrictive properties at moderate to strong dosages, and there may be reason to believe that "tying its wings" *a la* B-DFLY would potentiate this effect.


I've *heard*--and can't reliably confirm--that the deceased ingested on the order of 8-10 mg of the *R-(-)* stereoisomer of B-DFLY, aka the "European Batch," i.e., the more potent and psychoactive isomer.


If so, such a dose would be about 16-40 times what a sensible, knowledgeable, and responsible person would ingest.

Scary shit.  If I recall correctly, DOB has profound vasoconstrictive effects in higher doses, far in excess of those produced even by DOI, DOC or any of the TMAs.  Hence, it is quite toxic in overdose and can certainly be fatal.  DOB is a strong, **full** agonist at 5-HT2A, 2B and 2C receptors (producing at least 100% of the receptor activation of 5-HT itself), whereas DOI is a high-end partial agonist (~70% activation compared with 5-HT) and the tryptamines/ergoloids are lower-end partial agonists (~40% activation).  Considering the full agonist profile at the 5-HT2B receptor, I wouldn't be surprised if DOB could also cause cardiac problems.  Either way, it sounds like the bromo-phenethylamines (aside from 2C-B, which is a very weak partial agonist at 5-HT2 receptors) are best avoided.  I wonder if chloro-FLY or methyl-FLY would be safer.


Edit: tobala, you beat me to the punch.  I remember hearing about a DOB related death (from vascular collapse) where a person took a ~150mg dose, thinking it was MDMA.

The dose is a very important question, and 8-10mg is a huge amount.  The fact that it could cause amputations in a non fatal overdose is pretty incredible though.  


The various isomers and misinformation on this drug makes it hard to understand what's what with this drug.

**per tab brdf dose?**


were a hypothetical apprentice to lay some of the Eurobatch BRDF on blotter paper, what would you, my esteemed intrepids, suggest as a reasonable number of micrograms per tab?


thanks, i just fear he may have made them a bit strong.

This article surfaced a few months back.  I'm not sure of the details or the relevance since many others have taken the compound with no obvious issues.  Either way, I plan to keep my distance for the time being.


Just realized the article is on Erowid and refers to the same case mentioned above.  [http://www.erowid.org/references/refs_view.php?A=ShowDoc1&ID=7343](http://www.erowid.org/references/refs_view.php?A=ShowDoc1&ID=7343)

has this article been translate into english?

please, we do need this info.

i would be really surprized if an oral dose of a drug caused tissue necrosis.

if so, this we would really need to know

now, if this was an injection, yes, there are a number of substances that cause local necrosis, especially if they go into the "wrong" place.....im as opposed to iv or such

Apparently the compound acted as a long-acting efficacious vasoconstrictor, leading to necrosis and gangrene which was delayed by several weeks after the overdose occurred. Several other cases have also been reported of severe peripheral vasoconstriction following overdose with Bromo-DragonFLY, and a similar case is also known from DOB. Treatment was of limited efficacy in this case although tolazoline is reportedly an effective treatment where available.**[6][7]

Wow the guy did a licked finger print of bromo-dragonfly, that's the first I'd heard of that!


The article claims this could be "5-10mg" of the chemical but if the guy really did do a fingerprint, who knows, it could have been as high as 50mg.


Still, this is a chemical I will never be putting into my body.

I have to admit, I would take a low dose of bromo-dragonfly out of curiosity, if it ever became available to me. I'm not about to purchase a few hundred mg or a gram of it, though. I have this (morbid?) curiosity about really long trips... I wanna try the 2C-G-x's too..

I saw people being dosed with dragonfly at a recent campout I was at. I was all, "what?" and then I was all "what's the dosage?" "3 drops?" "what's a drop?" "I don't know, I just tried it 'til I found the sweet spot."


that coming from the person dosing them - he said the problem was that they don't know which batch of d-fly it is.

Thats kinda scary what BrDfly can do to you. I'm going to tell a friend of mine to stay clear of it cause he likes it a little to much. He told me that 2mgs of 5-meo-det helps the trip come on faster. Sounded dangerous to me though.

2mg of 5-MeO-DET?  I've never actually heard of someone using 5-MeO-DET recreationally.  I'd be interested in what kind of effects that has.  Sorry for the off topic, maybe your friend should consider sharing somewhere what 5-MeO-DET is like for him if he actually likes it.

It was ok. Visuals were better than LSD. Mind fuck was kept minimal. If you're looking for that kind of experience i would highly recommend it.


To those sayin u'll never try it because of the overdose stories.. They are OVERDOSE stories. OD'in on anything is gonna be nasty and to my knowledge would be relatively hard to do when aquiring a single dose.

I would post about 5-meo-det but I cannot find a thread for it. ( i didnt really look too damn hard for it) anyone got a link to a thread about that chem?

Hard to explain. Like LSD but alot more intense. More + better looking colours. Intense trails springing off of anything without the need for movement. Everythin looks so.. pretty, shiny and sparkly. Like in a psychedelic fairy land.

Hmm....that means some people lied to my buddy. I knew a guy that had a buch off it; I never sampled it myself and niether did he, and he had some rave kids over in seattle test it out for him at 1mg doses. They told him it wasn't really visual at all. However I do remember him saying those kids picked up every last drop he had of it.  I told him to try it out but he said why bother it wasn't worth it from what his friends told him. LOL I bet the kids just wanted it all for themselves.

You'd think so, huh? *sigh*.


2c-e. double felony. 70mg. not cool.

Since I mentioned 2c-e, I think I should say I find 2c-e at a dose of around 15mg to be more visual than say, 300 mics of L, full 3d OEV's and things even lucy wouldnt do (water flows in impossible 4d geometric patterns). Honestly, 2c-e gives me the craziest visuals, with quite a light mindfuck. When I get visuals like that on L, which has never happened to this degree, it would have to be fairly large doses, that would DEF be accompanied by a hell of a mindfuck, not being able to finish a sentence, etc. In fact, 2c-e (for me) becomes completely visual around +3hrs, until this point it feels much like MDXX, and this lasts for well over the 6 hours that PiHKAL and such state for the duration. I would say I trip for 8-12 hours off a ~15mg dose. With very little mindfuck. I'm wondering whether 2c-t-2 is worth a shot...


I hear that it is nauseating and all that shit. The only side effects I get from 2c-e... headache at peak (as with ALL tryps/phens for some reason) and jaw tension.

A little tidbit of data to add to the pile:


I gave a bunch of 1mg blotters (isomer unknown), that I'd somehow picked up along the way, to a close friend for Burning Man this year, and everyone gave it a stellar report, except for one guy who had a crisis, but from what I was told he would've had one on any psychedelic and should not have been given it to take in the first place.


They reported notable visuals, but only in the dark.  Any light dispelled the visuals immediately, and also brought with it a sort of "sober-ish" vibe.  Sleep was fine but the effects were still noticeable after.


Keep in mind that these people had already spent days taking MDMA/MDA/2C-'s etc., who knows how that may have skewed the results.


I sort of wish I'd held onto some of those blotters now, I do have a couple mg in alcohol in the freezer but I don't know whether or not it's the same isomer.  One neat thing is that one of the partakers was an underground psychedelic therapist who'd sort of been hoping to try bromo-dragonfly for a couple years, and he loved the experience.

this was sold to me as "Acid", from some punk kid. needless to say, i found out it wasn't acid. comeup was around 2-3 hours, only mild tracers in dark rooms, but body felt GREAT (comprable to MDMA) a lot of people in my area (Kansas) have been getting this shit, or DOI and taking it thinking it's acid. 

Sure, the high was good, but the complete lack of sleep and length (18 hrs per trip) were enough to discourage me for now. 

anyone know a good potentiator for this chem? or DOI?

^^ 18 hours?  Doesn't sound like b-dragonfly.  It lasts at least 24, if not longer.  What evidence do you have that it was bromo-dfly?


Your description could be any DOX, but by the great fel description it could easily be DOC.  But there's no way to tell without chemical analysis.  However, to assume it was bromo-dragonfly is probably quite a leap because it's much rarer than any other DOX you might receive.

Are you sure? Don't you mean 2C-B fly (the non aromatic derivative)? There was a load of it knocking about a year or two ago.

I think that's probably what he meant.


I found 2C-B-fly to be wonderful.  It wasn't strong mentally.  Rather, it aligned my energy into a truly beautiful euphoria.  I had the time of my life socializing with friend at a show and afterparty and I felt amazing for weeks afterward.  I would absolute love to find some more.

No, I don't mean the non-aromatic fly compound. I mean the aromatic 2CB-DFLY compound.

Sorry, it was several years ago, so my memories from the time are faint. The dosage was different from the FLY compound, which I hear is taken in 10mg doses... this was 2-4mg for a mediocre trip. 


Anyway the visuals were very 2c:ish, lots of eyecandy and sparkle. A bit heavier than "normal" 2c:s though, walls bubbling and such. The audio distortion was funny, there was kind of a flange effect in everything.

Xorkoth: after a tad bit of research, found many aspects of trip to be like DOC but still not enough to convince me. Recently picked up 2 more doses (at or around 2.5 mg  piece), will attempt to further research on other DOX's

Just to let you know, DOB and DOB-Dragonfly are two different things.  Here's how they chemically differ:  [http://www.erowid.org/psychoactives/chemistry/chemistry_compare.php?lm=bromo_dragonfly_2d&rm=dob_2d](http://www.erowid.org/psychoactives/chemistry/chemistry_compare.php?lm=bromo_dragonfly_2d&rm=dob_2d)


As you can see, they are in different classes, with the Dragonfly version being rarer and less researched.

a buddy found some tabs in his things that he think was there for around 6 months he said t had no protection but was away from light. anyway we took one each the other day not expecting much. and after 2 hours we started feeling something and so after 30 mins craziness and it lasted for around 20 hours coudlnt get to sleep it was really hard to get to sleep.


the name of the ta was Where is Wally the ones that were around UK early this year.


I think is was BromoDragon-FLY


Does BROMODRAGON-FLY still legal in UK?

That's what I'd say about 2c-b-fly too, definitely beyond what I'd seen with 2c-i or 2c-c, except maybe with high dose 2c-c.  It was very visual and awfully confusing in high dose.  My guess is they're closer to being full agonists as compared to their counterparts, but who knows.

So I had 100mg of this stuff last year.  The first time I tried it was on New Year's 07-08 and I was an idiot and just eyeballed a small grain and threw it in a capsule.  Bad idea.  The visuals were absolutely ridiculous.  Very reminiscent of 2c-e on a visual basis.  Utter eradication of all things recognizable.  Just complete meltdown in my visual cortex.  Not much else though. Music was difficult.  I have never heard Jessica sound so dysphoric.  Lucid thoughts for the most part, when I wasn't overcome by fear and panic.  The dose must've been extreme.  I had peripheral numbness, extreme sympathetic activation, elevated heart rate.  I panicked about the vasoconstriction and proceeded to get very drunk in an effort to dilate.  Tequila jello-shots were all i could get down and down they went.  Suffice it to say, I wound up getting totally smashed, all the while tripping balls.  But it worked, I regained sensation while I was drunk (not to mention had the first bit of fun all trip).  It was an interesting experience to sober up from being that drunk without sleep.  Eventually I managed to recover the next day.  Really scary experience though.  It left me traumatized.  I was incredibly scared I'd need an amputation or something.  Subsequent trips, regardless of substance, produced similar effects, all be it probably psychosomatic.

I rediscovered the substance much later in 08 and made a dilution of 100mcg/mL and slowly began experimenting at controlled doses.  When I got up to around 1.3-1.5mg, I started experiencing the tingling and numbness again.  The lower doses were at times, enjoyable. It felt so chemical though and artificial in my body.  Felt kinda grimy too.  Also, the duration, typically around 24 hours, made my eyes burn.  On lower doses, it was possible to fall asleep for a full nights rest and wake up still under its influence.

Nothing really special.  I don't think it merits any further use on my part any time soon.

For fuck's sake... ![8o](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eek.gif)  What got into those people?  Aside from a lethal dose of bromo-dragonfly that is?

At first I thought it was a typo, or that nano was high as a kite! Any links regarding these poor people who ingested a gram of this stuff each? What a horrible demise that must have been...

Poor poor people.  The terror must've been extraordinary once they realized what a mistake they'd made.  I think I had a read an experience or news article citing pedal amputation at 80mg but I may be mistaken.

2.8 grams would have killed me.  I'm sure of it.  At the very least, I wouldn't be whole in body or mind again.

You're right, when i posted that, I was thinking 2.8 mg (which wouldn't kill but I was being dramatic %)) .  2.8 grams would kill anyone for sure.

2.8 grams or 0.28 grams would almost definitely kill anyone, as would 80 mg (I believe the pedal amputations were with ingestion of only 8 mg, not 80 mg).

**crazy shit**


When I took Bromo-DragonFLY it was given to me as a single blotter. I wasn't told of the dose it carried but ,as I was someone willing to take any kind of trip a few years ago, I didn't care. After taking the hit sublinguily I noticed no effects for three hours. Then it was the most amazing unexplainable experience of my life. I experienced dying in seven different ways each based on fears I've had since I was young. These painful and horrifying experiences completely rid me of these irrational fears and made my life a lot better. The 18 hours of constant tripping did get frightening at times but I recommend to experienced trippers.

I'm glad you had such a wonderful experience, since mine was rather dull. I tripped for ~24 hours and benzo'ed myself to sleep at 30 or 36 (Can't remember; it's been a while).


I was mostly thinking about money, which is pretty unusual for me, although it gave me some realistic insights. Nothing really profound though.

What is weird is that all my other friends who took it said it was like a moderate acid trip for 24 hours but for me it was a complete mindfuck. It may have had something to do with the fact I had been taken super b complex vitamins for a month prior to the experience. Or maybe I'm just lucky. ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

I have 2mg of this stored away.  I'm thinking about trying it sometime soon when I'm going to be spending the day outside.  Anyone who's tried it have an idea about how I should do it?  Should I take the whole dose, or half (1mg), or should I take like 1.2 or 1.5mg?  I have some general DOX tolerance as I have a lot of experience with DOC and use it on many weekends.

Wow, I haven't done many psychs but this is most assuredly one of them.  The chance to give someone as experienced as you advice is irresistible ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) .  I found this chemical to be really weird personally.  The first time I took it, it was an over the top insane dose, probably 2-3mg.  It was rough, really rough.  You can find the experience a page or two back.  Just to sum it up, ridiculous world shattering visuals, strong vasoconstriction. Mind you, no tolerance to anything really, but i'd have plenty of experience with LSD, much, molly, and 2c-e.  So I made a solution of 200mics/3mL and just starts testing that way.  800 mics and below were barely visual, very little movement, but certainly some rainbow trash floating around.  The mind was lucid and clear, but extremely pliable.  I could take it down any path I chose and make great connections with paths I'd visited before.  Social interaction was also bearable.  The length of time eventually wore me down for something that was really quite subtle.  The area around my eyes because very tense, my face felt grimy even after repeated washes.  I think I tapped out with 1 or 2 mg clonazepam.  I forget.

I had worked up to that 800 mic dose and just observed a steady strengthening but it still felt very removed from the horror show I'd experienced the first time.  So I upped the dose a bit to about 1.4mg and the numbness came back with some very real patterning and motion in my visual field.  Not as difficult as that first time though.  Honestly, my post on the previous page or two is articulated a bit better.  I just dragged my ass out of bed.

My recommendation, make a solution.  then try 100mics for safety's sake, then bump it to 500mics, and finally 1.4mg.  Hope this helps.

Bromo is goood stuff. Had experience with 300 and 800uqs of the 'european batch' and so far, from my point of view it is a powerful psychedellic drug. I don't really understand why so many people are describing this as a mild, subtile experience. Maybe their doses did not have been high enough?

I think a lot of the people describing how they got it on blotter (not all of them, but some) just were told by there dealer it was "teh BromoDragonFLY!!1" because it sounds cool, but it really wasn't BrDragonFly and then all the reports get confusing.  Hard to say, but that's my opinion.

Bromo can develop an unbelievable intensity. I doses 800uq two days ago and I completely got shredded down to the very core of my existance. It was more intense and deeper than any acid-trip I did before. It was deeper than 2CE and dxm together. I am so impressed by this drug. Surely no toy, no easy trip unexperienced users.

1mg for the first time is WAY to much if you are not very experienced with psychedellic drugs. Start with 250uq, so you still will have 750uq left. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I'm in the same boat as Swilow. I have one blotter at 1mg of D-fly. How well does this stuff store? Saving it for a (long) special occasion. I'm guessing this would be too much to take for a music festival?

I just tried a little bit of brdfly just to see if i get strange result (a quarter of a drop, which should be less than 100 u).

I get only some slight colors shifting and a kind of tryptamine head space wilth some stimulation.


I have some questions:

Is it an amphetamine ?

Why other derivative like in DOx family hasn't been made ?

The Br-Dragonfly wasn't a success to put it mildly,and we had those necrosis victims,remember that horror pictures? And it could be an interchelator (sticking in your DNS)-so none's gonna touch the dragonfly class again (which isn't an amphetamine in its strict sense btw).More hope came from the fly's.

DOBFLY has an unique length of peak experience. If the dose is set right, it is absolutely _no_ problem to experience a heavy peak for 12hrs. This is 2-4times longer than an average LSD-peak, wich already does last quite long compared to mushrooms or mescaline. From my experience until now, the musce cramps etc. seem to be dose-dependent and psychosomatic as well. Negative aspects of your personal headspace usually lead to a somewhat strange and heavy bodyload, wich I also noticed on 2CE. However, the ground vibration of DOBFLY is a very nice one. very deep and clear, beautiful euphoria. Very very beautiful visuals. Actually more beautiful than any other phen I've taken before. Compared to 2CE, there a less spectacular, but deeper and more magical. Not unlike LSD.

Anyone have any knowledge of the stability of bromo-dragonfly in an ethanol solution?  I plan to keep it in a brown bottle, but I'm wondering if the freezer is necessary.

i rememeber when bromo-dragonfly just became available.

It came as 1mg diluted in solution (i know some of u here remember that).


I dont know how long it would last though, PEA's are pretty stable, but this isnt technically a PEA.

 A freezer cant hurt IMO

Well, I suppose that DOx's would be the closest thing to compare it to.  Are they stable in ethanol for long periods of time, like a few years or so?

**2 bdf experiences from the B1 batch**


A friend tested 65ugs to establish if such low dose could be active:


> At 1:30 Feeling good, full of energy, reminds of MDMA more than other phens. Neon colours and shiny lights. Sight focusing a little difficult. Music sounds good.
> 
> 2:00 Happiness all arround, even tears. Emotions flow with the music.
> 
> 2:30 Fucking marvelous, different to any psychedelic had until now. 
> 
> 3:00 Effects go away slowly. The dose is clearly very low, but active for someone sensitive to psychedelics.
> 
> 3:00 Effects still linger.
> 
> 4:00 Effects fade away.
> 		
> Click to expand...


120 ugs It lasted 6 hours (with some after effects that wouldn't let him sleep)


> 30 mins after ingestions: pleasure similar to low dose triptamine, feel alright.
> 
> 45: Feel incredibly well. An amphetamine touch with triptamine euphoria. Feel like god. Previous anxiety towards the substance has gone.
> 
> 1h30: Still feel great. Laughter. Nice talking on the phone to friends.
> 
> 2h: If heaven exists its name is BDF. Colours intensified. Cry of happiness.
> 
> 2h30: Slight nausea but still alright. Light can nag a little. Slight space distortions. Difficulty typing.
> 
> 3h: Strong space distortions. Slight fractal visuals with eyes closed. Music sounds great.
> 
> 3h20: Light starts to be annoying. Leave only 4 small lightbulbs on.
> 
> 4h: Effects start to decline slightly.
> 
> 4h30:I can still feel it clearly.
> 
> 5h: Sleepy but decide not to go to bed in order to continue enjoying the substance. Music and thoughts flowing.

Thanks very much for the reports.


I've always been curious about these ones.  I find intriguing that only the Bromo versions have been produced.  the other halogens and alkyls haven't even really been talked about much.


The potency sure is interesting.  Similar to LSD.

i have left my sample out in the light and air for several weeks and their is a visible yellowing of the power, i still have not sampled it so i have no way of knowing if there is a decrease in potency - but the yellowing is quite significant (eggnog colored on the side facing the sun with the underside of the bag still being the color of chalk dust) im not too concerned as even if the stuff looses 50% of its potency ill still have more than enough - but it should be noted, i suppose.

Wouldn't the degradation be a bad thing? It will lose potency but wouldn't it create some kind of bad reaction on the material?

Just a couple notes..


I did another 250ug dose for new years eve, figured the energy boost would help me party out the night. That was a solid idea. HOwever I still notice a dip in energy round hour 8, weird how that works. Its almost like mental exhaustion, even though there was little to no trip whatsoever.


Next day however, I got a gram of coke and proceeded to blow that away for the next 6 hours. Towards the end there was some pretty notable vasoconstriction in the fingers. They were just kinda bluer than normal. They felt fine, and look fine a day later. But comparing now 2 days later, to the day of, they were really quite purple then. 


I never noticed it with JUST the BDF, so Im assuming it was an increased combo effect from the addition of the coke.

Longest duration without sleep was about 24 hours with 900uq. Normally I can sleep after 14-16hours. The afterglow can last up to 2-3 days with the feeling of still having a chemical in your system; unlike LSD, where the afterglow does not feel that mutch like a chemical reaction still going on.


From my experience (I have tripped on BDFLY about 20 times right now) so far, Bromo lasts about twice as long as LSD and feels very much like LSD at half of the speed. The onset takes 5-6 hours, The peak 4-8 hours and the climbing back to baseline 10-20 hours. It is pretty normal to wake up the other day and still have some funny colours on your mind.

Bromo also tends to build up in several 'waves' until the peak is reached, wich is very similar to LSD. The optical distortions and the body high also feel similar, but are less agressive and specific. Bromo is more gentle and subtile, a little easier on the mind and less pushy than LSD. Nevertheless it is a very powerful psychedellic drug and can lead you to the same kind of ego-loss that one experiences on highdose LSD. It has a strong stimulating aspect wich makes Bromo a good choice for people who get easily tired on tryptamines. BDFLY feels much more like a tryptamine than any other phen I tried until now, including 2CE and DOM.


It is no surprise that there's a strong cross tolerance between BDFLY and LSD. And they also combine very very well.

Id say for me I would dose at 3 AM, and have trouble sleeping until maybe 24hrs and thats with 750ug.


Course some good ole peruvian OTC valium and xanax help make that night much much much easier. I really recommend benzos on hand for this shit, otherwise youll just be tossing and turning alllll night.

Second the above, some form of sleeping aid is a must in the come down from higher doses, even if you do dose early in the day.


I've noticed that even after a 500 mcg trip has mostly died down during the 12-16 hour mark, peripheral stimulation will keep you awake for hours on end, and can get you to climbing the walls at 4 in the morning when its impossible to rest. Some sort of benzo or even a reasonably potent antihistamine is essential to getting any sleep.


Unlike several other psychedelics, I've found melatonin to be straight worthless at any dose for falling asleep on this stuff.

Any data points on solubility of bromo-dragonfly?  I've got about 1mg/ml in ethanol and I think that's about its limit there.  I'm hoping there's something I can get about 20mg/ml in.  I'm thinking of playing around a bit with some dry acetone and distilled water.

I intend to try it one day - I've passed on the opportunities I've had so far due to being in somewhat less than good cardiovascular health. However I'm a working on that and have been for a while - my intentions being to sample stuff like Bdfly & ibogaine once I'm satisfied that I've taken as many precautions healthwise as i need to /can do.


1mg/ml seems pretty low solubilty to me - anyone any ideas why it's so low?

i have some bromo that ive been real hesitant to try, mainly because of physical problems i have read about. i also usually dont have 20 hours to spare and do nothing, will have to wait i suppose.


as for storage, ive been keeping it in capsules, inside a baggie, inside a  container in complete darkness and at least room temp, so im sure nothing has happened to it.


several friends of mine have tried it though, and this is the main things they said about it.

1st trial 500-750ug, didnt feel anything, only a slight headache on one of my friends.

2nd trial with 750ug-1.25mg, come up was about 5-6 hours and filled with waves that only kept getting stronger. then the peak comes and lasts for at least 10 hours, then he slowly came down. over all he said it lasted a solid 20 hours, maybe a bit more.

I've heard 2mg/ml of ethanol for one of the DOx's, can't remember which.  So, 1mg/ml doesn't seem completely off based to me.  Another possibility is the little bits that aren't going into solution are impurities, but I don't really think that's the case.  When I look at the vial it's in, I see little crystal veins that have recrystallized slightly above the level of the alcohol.  That suggests equilibrium to me.


Anyone know what concentration can be achieved in water?  Or at least some info on what levels have been achieved?  Otherwise, I'm gonna start playing around.

So, I got to experimenting.  Distilled water sucks for bromo-dragonfly.  Acetone is where it's at.  I got over 25mg/ml in solution.  Acetone isn't great for consuming, but if you're looking to consume a solution directly, a solution of that potency would be a nightmare.  If you're looking to make a solution for measuring individual doses, I'd recommend ethanol at 1mg/ml concentration or less.

**riding the dragonfly.**


I have recently aquired a vial of bromo-dragon fly from an extremely reputable source. It is apparently the R isomer and is disolved in ethonal at roughly 75ug per drop. I have had two experiences. One at 675ug and one at 975ug. 


The visuals were nice. Reminded me in character of 2c's. I found that my mind stayed very lucid throughout the experience. This made me feel like something was missing, but i felt similar with high dose 2c-b. As for the amphetimine aspects, they are definately noticable, but not in any enjoyable way. Both times I dosed I would alter between being unsure if I was enjoying myself and thinking I was enoying myself. It was never a definate good time or bad time, sort of neutral.-- which is not what I am looking for in a psychadelic experience. 


Also, as for this being a 24 hour trip, it has been more along the lines of 16 hours for this sailor.


I plan to try this molecule one more time at 1200ug.


 Report will be written.

Personally, I found bromo-dragonfly to be very fun. As others have commented, it has wonderful visuals (like acid and mescaline together) and a clear headspace, at least for me. A girl I know who took the same dose as me (1mg of the batch that was mislabeled as 2C-B-FLY, which __i think__ is less potent than the 'european' batch) had her mind pretty shredded, she was confused and constantly contradicting herself. I've never seen anyone else respond to it that way. Dosage uncertainty definitely comes into play - I had a few 1mg capsules, and obviously some were stronger than others. So one provided a full 30+ hour trip, while another was more like 16. I suspect there's less of this if you have blotters though.


my two bromo trip reports:

So yesterday morning at 8:22am I ingested approximately 1050mics of bromo dragonfly. This was my third time dosing, with my two previous doses being 675 and 975mics. My close friend who is 2,000 miles away also ingested the same dose of the same batch, which was sent to him via USPS. I began to feel the effects within 2 hours, and I would say I was feeling the full out effects at about 3 hours in, with the peak lasting for about 12-14 hours followed by a slow climb back down to sleep which was helped with a 6 pack of delicious IPA’s.


This report is more a summary of how I feel about bromo dragonfly as opposed to a detailing of the effects. 


For one, I don’t really know how I feel about this chemical. It is a very definite serious psychedelic experience, but its not very comfortable. It leaves my mouth and body feeling so “Chemy” throughout the experience and it is pretty hard to ignore. All three times I have dosed, for the first roughly 8-10 hours of the experience I have altered between being unsure if I was having a good time and maybe thinking I was having a good time. It was never a definite really good time or a really bad time. It’s a very weird headspace. 


What also has happened all three times I have dosed, is that the experience becomes much more enjoyable about 10 hours into the trip. Its almost like the amphetamine aspects sorta mellow out into an almost mild MDMA/speed headspace, where there is a euphoria, not quite as pushy as a full dose of MDMA, but it is very noticeable. Everything becomes pretty funny at this point in the trip, and this has happened all three times, with the higher doses providing a higher euphoria. 


Something that first put me off on this chemical, was the lack of insight or profoundness with the experience. Whenever I experience intense visuals off of other psychedelics, there is a headspace that comes along with the visuals; its not that I am only seeing wonderful things, but my head is altered.  LSD provides feeling of connection and insight, mushrooms provide extreme ego loss,  and so forth, however bromo dragonfly will envelope my world in visuals, but my headspace is like a mild dose of speed, like too mild to be enjoyable, but enough to make my head spin.


The visuals are really nice. Very 2C-ish. Mayan heads and vines and Persian carpet type patterning. My friend in Chicago, who is a bit bigger than me physically, and who took the same dose, from the same batch, out of the same vial, was hit somewhat harder than I was I think. He said he had some bouncing of his eyes, and he said there were periods were everything was sorta blurry. My vision stayed pretty crystal clear. There was some rainbow trash still floating in my vision today, after over 24 hours from dosing. 

Two of the times I have dosed, I had puked at about 2 hours in, and then was fine. The same thing happened with my friend. 


The flavor bromo dragonfly leaves in your mouth could best be described as what toxic would taste like. 


This stuff last a long time, it hasn’t been a 30 hour trip for me any of the three times I have dosed, but I could definitely see the amount of time your tripping for being dose dependant. This trip was definitely significantly more intense than my last two experiences and it was intense for a longer amount of time this time as well. I was going to dose at 1200mics, but I am very glad now that I did not. 


 	Quotes from the notes which I sorta half assed took during the experience.-

---“bromo dragonfly makes my dick shrink like I am running from the police”

----“this is what I would assume toxic tastes like”


And on one last note, this substance just tends to produce a very gross sorta toxic chemy feeling throughout your body, and I could definitely see ODing on bromo Dragonfly being one of the shittiest ways to leave this world. So be safe fellow travelers.


i hope this isnt too long. let me know if it is. ~ apra

done bromo well over 20 times... furthest i took it (knowingly) was 4mg taken in 3 1200-1300ug doses (due to accuracy of the scales)... definately the most intense & memorable tryp of my life (bar dmt) massively intense visuals... but remaining compus mentus throughout.


when first came upon bromo was misold it as 2cb fly, shared a 'small' 8mg dose with a friend at the same time as a 30mg dose of amt.... dont remember a THING. my friend who aquired it smashed a insufflated 8mg!!! like being dragged through hell and back for 70 or so hours....


watch out for this one.... super acid! also more toxic pound for pound than cyanide....


ld supposed around 16mg


anyone hear of the moron who stole a bag at secret garden party earlier this year and did a 500mg line not knowing what he had stolen!!! not a nice death id imagine!

Yes, this is a common effect of DOX chemicals (which DOB-dragonfly is based on).  They give you a full-on trip at first, which includes a wide variety of emotions and effects as psychedelic experiences do.  Then anywhere from 6 to 10 hours in, they start to shift into the second stage, which is a really nice, warm, euphoric plateau.  The quality of this plateau depends on the substance.  I didn't really like DOB-dragonfly... I agree with most of the points you made in your report regarding its effects.  I found the plateau stage to be alright, but nothing special.


In the DOX family I've tried DOB, DOC, DOI, DOM, and DOB-dragonfly.  The standard by which I measure the quality of one of them is DOC, which has a wonderful full-on trip section and an even better second stage plateau where I feel inspired, motivated, energized, mentally adept, euphoric, loving, and calm and content (not ampy).  DOC is also pretty safe compared to DOB-dragonfly... pretty large doses have been taken and it'

s generally well-tolerated... no deaths have ever been reported.  It can cause some vasoconstrictions occasionally though, usually if you dose too high for your body chemistry.  


If DOC is a 10 on a 1 to 10 scale of DOXs, then  DOB-dragonfly, for me, is a 3.


DOB-dragonfly creeps me out a bit because it's SO potent and relatively small overdoses have killed people.  It feels pretty unsafe to me, and its mediocre effects compared to every other DOX I've tried make it completely not worth the risk.

Mhmmm. Bromo-Dragonfly is the first phen I tried so far that could put me in a state of near-ego-death.  Maybe 2CE can do that trick as well.

Bromo to me feels very warm and forgiving if the dose is not too high. It feels more like a glowing and melting experience, while I remember DOM to be more edgy and sharp.

DOBFLY and LSD is a very nice combo. Highly recommended!


Xorkoth: Since you have experience with both DOB and bromo; how do they compare to each other?

I agree. It does feel unsafe. I do not regret trying it tho. I read on another forum, that benzodifurons, (the unique molecule formation of bromo dragonfly) have been known to be DNA intercalculators.-- not in the microgram range, but still. 


 It just about blows me away that you can buy this chemical as powder off of the internet. Not even the fact you can can buy it as powder which is hard to dose proper in the minute amount needed with this chemical. Not many people understand crystal to solution basics when dealing with mic's. But also just the fact it can be bought off of the internet. 


This is how I concluded a report for another forum, --"SWIM tends to think that with the amount of time, the negative side effects, and the resulting experience which one gets out of consuming bromo dragonfly, its just might not be worth it. Especially when safe, high quality, and wonderful molecules like LSD and DMT tend to always be around."


~be safe fellow travelers.

I've taken Bromo-Dragonfly (a confirmed part of the notorious "B1" batch that caused the deaths of an RC purveyor and others) at least 7 times, and I'm still not entirely sure how I feel about it. The first time I was quite impressed by it, by the increased energy levels, mild but unique visual, and the feeling of mentally being in a higher gear, more clever (at 350mcg). Since then I've taken it in doses of up to 600mcg, and will definitely do it again, as I'm not going to run out in this lifetime...but I think that it does have some drawbacks.


One problem is the body load. The come-up can be difficult, with nausea, restlessness, and muscle tension, which is worst in the first three hours. Even when its in full gear, there is a moderate sense of edginess. I agree with Apradavra when he describes it as a slightly toxic feeling (very similar to the tension caused by methylphenidate). This wears off after 6-8 hours, but it makes the experience much less physically comfortable than say, mushrooms. Also, one can experience what I call "dragonfly shivers" very brief bouts of shuddering (not involuntary) that seem to send a wave of tiny tremors throughout your body. I have found that taking an occasional nitrous balloon, once every half hour or so, is a nice way to let off some of the tension. Cannabis can also work, and really brings out the visual qualities of BDFLY as well.


Another drawback is the absurd amount of energy it gives you (though some don't have this problem). After hour 4, I will want to go on endless walks to let off this energy, because if I'm sitting down I will get really restless and fidgety. First time I took it, I walked continuously for over 8+ hours, and when I came home I was not the least bit tired. This makes me think this would be an ideal chem for taking long hikes in the mountains, though I haven't tried that yet. Also, this energy makes falling asleep within 24+ hours of dosing impossible without a decent benzo or some opioids to calm the legs. 


The biggest problem with BDFLY though, it is its lack of a "normal" psychedelic headspace. Apradavra put it very well, and I never really knew how to vocalize what I felt was missing in all my experiences until I read his post. With other psychedelics, one feels connections, and sees new relations between concepts and ideas, which generate psychedelic epiphanies. BDFLY is extremely deficient in this sense, it seems to be much more of a "surface level" psychedelic, providing interesting visuals, but always feeling as though its leading up to something bigger, and then falling short. Unlike Morning Glories or psilocybin, BDFLY trips tend to feel somewhat unfinished, like a sort of psychedelic tease. Because of this, I've wanted to try BDFLY in combination with a threshold dose of mushrooms, to induce a more provocative, meaningful experience, which I have yet to encounter with BDFLY alone.


However, it also has a lot to recommend it. The pros don't need as much description as the cons, so I think I can just list them briefly:


-Mood lift

-increased self-confidence

-Very nice CEV's and OEV's (though the visuals from BDFLY seem to look more "synthetic" then those of other psychedelics)

-Increased mental spontaneity (more amphetamine-like than psychedelic)

-Conversation enhancement, what you and others say seems more insightful

-Mild time-distortion

-(I'm sure there are others I'm forgetting, but this post is too damn long already, sorry guys ![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif)

Also, this energy makes falling asleep within 24+ hours of dosing impossible without a decent benzo or some opioids to calm the legs.

> The biggest problem with BDFLY though, it is its lack of a "normal" psychedelic headspace. Apradavra put it very well, and I never really knew how to vocalize what I felt was missing in all my experiences until I read his post. With other psychedelics, one feels connections, and sees new relations between concepts and ideas, which generate psychedelic epiphanies. BDFLY is extremely deficient in this sense, it seems to be much more of a "surface level" psychedelic, providing interesting visuals, but always feeling as though its leading up to something bigger, and then falling short. Unlike Morning Glories or psilocybin, BDFLY trips tend to feel somewhat unfinished, like a sort of psychedelic tease. Because of this, I've wanted to try BDFLY in combination with a threshold dose of mushrooms, to induce a more provocative, meaningful experience, which I have yet to encounter with BDFLY alone.

> One important warning about mixing BDFLY w/ other substances, with two examples. I think that BDFLY definitely has a more delusional quality then most psychedelics, so be careful what you mix it with. In one case, a friend of mine, to whom I gave a dose of 350 mcg, decided to eat a fairly potent edible two hours after dosing, became delusional, and apparently had a painful psychological breakdown after he left to go to his boyfriends house (had I know this would happen, I would have tried to prevent it). Also, I once made the mistake of getting stupidly drunk at a party with some friends on the tail-end of one of the trips, rationalizing that it would help me fall asleep. Instead, the stimulation caused me to drink way too much because I didn't register the alcohol, and I apparently went completely nuts, convinced that I was over 300 years old and cursed by God; completely manic, yelling and delusional (though not violent). Stupid of me, but now I know better, and hope others won;t make the same mistake. ![:|](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eyesclosed.gif)

By itself though, I don't think you can reach those levels without taking a dose that will take a definite toll on your body, 600 mcg already feels borderline-toxic during the come-up for me (though I probably will try higher doses at some point).

**Bromo-DragonFLY**


Bromo-DragonFLY is a strange psychadelic that is almost as powerful as LSD, but its effects can last several days (way longer than DOB).  There have been a few stories in the media about people overdosing on it.  Seizures may also occur.  A 22 year old man from Copenhagen died after ingesting Bromo-DragonFLY, for example. His friend described the trip as "It was like being dragged to hell and back again. Many times. It is the most evil [thing] I've ever tried. It lasted an eternity."  Another person nearly died choking on their own vomit while on the drug.  First synthesized in 1998, Bromo may be illegal in the US and Australia since it falls under analog laws.  However, it may be legally sold in other countries (although it is scheduled in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark).


Here's some photos:

Has anyone here had any experience with this drug?  It is not to be confused with 2C-B-FLY.

I have experience with bromo-df , I took both isomers R+ and second  less active "S-"?

what can i say , in my opinion this second isomer is much better than first , visual are very strong , very geometric , duration is shorter , but dosages is a bit higher (any 500 ug) , but unfortunately I heard that nobody don't  make this compound , presently. In sell is available  R+  but in my subjective opinion isn't interesting , duration is very long , very hard for body , visuals aren't any special , I noticed that is it "3 dimension " psychedelic , I cant explain this, you must try if you wanna understand me ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

The vasoconstriction on this one makes it a no go for me.  DOC did the same thing.  A numbness in the gluts and inner thighs.  Very strange sensation.  I just acquired some 25I and 25C.  Sincerely hoping to avoid a similar reaction.

I will admit that I thoroughly enjoyed the few experiences I had . . . except the first one.  It does feel somewhat toxic, no other way to really describe that.  At the higher end of the doses I tried (1100mcg IIRC), the visuals were some of the most exciting I've had from a PEA.  Way more alive than the breathtaking visuals of 2C-E.  As has been stated previously, maintained cognition throughout even the heaviest of experiences. 

I've had a bunch laying around in solution for almost four years.  I wonder if that shit is any good anymore.  I would never take it again though.  Not a chance.


I'll tell you this.  I wish I had been a member of this fine forum back then.  Could've saved me the anguish of my first dose.  What a fucking trip!

Hello! First post, from South Brazil here. 


Thanks for the info, descriptions of experiences, doses, cautions and everything - very usefull


Dealers are selling BDFLY in blotters as LSD - bought some HOFFMANS 100 YEARS (here in brazil knowed as bike 100 years, [http://fc00.deviantart.net/fs23/f/2008/016/9/6/Bike_100_Years___LSD_by_coringabr.jpg](http://fc00.deviantart.net/fs23/f/2008/016/9/6/Bike_100_Years___LSD_by_coringabr.jpg)) 


Bought yesterday as acid for *-snip- No price discussion ~Jesusgreen ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)* - friends of mine would have fuck it up taking 4 or 5 blotters, if not mine researches and you guys! The backside says the lsd formula, misleading again and putting risks in demonizing such a wonderfull little chemical.


BASTARDS! 


As a experienced psychedelic user, tried  yesterday christmas a third part of blotter at 4 p.m, and after 3 hours (7 pm), more one third part, total two of three parts - and WOW, after 5h everything starts to change


Im still on the spacey felling after smoke marihuana (mora than 30 h)


AMAZING experience, NEVER saw visuals like that, a lot of time over the experience, not even with LSD or AYAHUASCA, which I took for more than 10 times. No insights or mindfucks, cristal clear - so I knowed it was not lsd


I felt A little bit paranoid because on the 5th hour vasoconstriction of fingers came, so I took a shower and change clothes, regaining the body focus and normal sensations. The first 5 hours were AMPHETAMINE, and after that, mixed psychodelic with MDMA feelings of everything beautyfullness, have a bunch of amazing experiences til 7. a.m (16 hours later) with loads of synesthesia and patters emerging from darkness


questions is someone knows


1) Do this substance cause dependence?

2) Do it has neurotoxicity?

3) Did someone tried with LSD? and about the doses?


awesome thanks

How do you know this is BDFLY? Has it been independently confirmed? I say that because there are often blotters misrepresented as LSD, but they are normally dosed with a DOx compound.


16 hours of tripping sounds like it could have been something like DOB or DOC, or maybe even DOI. BDFLY is a pretty rare compound to find these days. And I believe it lasts longer than that.


If it was BDFLY, then to answer your questions:


1. BDFLY does not cause dependence in the sense of opiates, benzos, dissociatives, cocaine or amphetamines. Any desire to redose the next day or so would only arise from the nostalgic wish to experience the euphoria again, rather than the result of typical dependence/reward seen in other types of drugs.


2. It should not be neurotoxic.


3. I have no idea if this has been combined with LSD, but BDFLY is so rare I would imagine it will difficult to find someone who has. Even so, it's probably not the wisest combo.


Answers to questions 1 and 2 should apply to all similar psychedelics in the phenethylamine, tryptamine, and lysergamide classes.

Hi guys,


First post, long time lurker. 


Let me start off by saying that this forum has provided me with enough information to save my life a few times over, so first things first, thank you for your generous information. 


Another point I'd like to make clear is that the following is by no means responsible, and I cannot stress enough that the actions I put forward in this post should be used as an example of what NOT TO DO. My lesson learnt is also yours. Please be careful. 


A little background information on myself. I am 26 years of age, and have been clean for over 5 years. I have a long history of drug abuse, however, have found myself in a happy place, clean, good job, good girlfriend, happy days. I no longer use, apart from the odd, I guess what you would call, hiccup. I may be inclined to take an LSD trip, shrooms, MDMA and maybe the odd dose of IV meth or cocaine, although I hate meth these days. Devil drug.  My use of drugs of this nature would only be a bi-annual occurrence. Maybe more. Sometimes. You get me?


A friend of mine, a worldy sort, and by no means a drug addict, had acquired a bundle of "LSD" tabs from a random source at a music festival over three years ago. Ever since, he has been insisting we share the experience as he had heard that these particular acid trips were rather on the strong side. Knowing he had only kept them in his freezer wrapped up in a currency note only, I was never really fussed but played along with his insistence anyway.


Let me say now, I am a fairly heavy drinker now, not an alcoholic, but in my area of residence where drinking is almost as staple as milk and bread, I am heavy. What I'm getting at is, my past can from time to time manifest itself as a compulsive binge. So as settled and sorted as I may be, the drug addict in me will always rear it's head from time to time. 


The friend I spoke of who was in possession of the "LSD" recently decided he was throwing everything away to go to South America for three years. This being one of my best friends, we decided we should go weekend trip to the coast to farewell each other for the near future. It wasn't spoken of but I knew, that this would be the time that he would bring the acid, and it would be taken. I assumed he'd destroyed it in his crude freezer treatment. 


At this point I'd like to point out that he had given a work colleague ONE blotter of this acid, a guy who had supposedly ingested more acid than anyone else we'd met, a middle aged hanger on, and  he'd called him during his trip and said something along the lines of..."only take quarter mannnnn". Sirens are ringing? Well you hear this kind of thing all the time where I'm from so you learn to ignore sales pitches...


We had the weekend to ourselves. A whole holiday home facing the ocean on some of the most beautiful coast on the planet. We get there on the Friday afternoon, and Aussies being Aussies, we hit the booze hard straight away. We had a BBQ, a fine meal with beautiful local red wine, and drank and drank and drank. I don't smoke marijuana anymore, as it makes me anxious, however, the others were smoking joint after joint. 


A couple of the more responsible gentlemen went to bed, and the girls. Which left only three of us, on the balcony, the three best friends of the lot. 


About an hour after being left to our own devices, "G" I'll call him states, "lets drop this acid". 


At this point, completely drunk beyond belief, we all jump at the opportunity. 


Normally we would take one blotter each as a minimum. Knowing this guy told us it was super strong and to use with caution, we took half each. Straight away, as soon as it hits my tongue, I know something is up. It's bitter, burning my tongue, and it tastes like chemicals. I'm too drunk too care (cannot stress enough again, this is terribly irresponsible, and a reason why alcohol can be so dangerous) so I don't bother saying anything. 


Two hours of drinking go by, and feeling zero effects, before we all decide that we should dose again, pretty calm in the knowledge that its probably been destroyed in the freezer. So we all take another half. 


At this point it is about 1 am, and we are at that drunk point where you're about to pass out, like being on the nod without the euphoria. 


All of a sudden someone says something funny and I realise  I'm ten times more awake than I thought we were. We've gone from on the nod alcohol passed outness, to rather awake in the space of ten minutes. From memory this is around three and a half hours after our first dose. 


I start becoming more alert of my surroundings, not tripping, not stimulated, just awake, like the alcohol had been drained from our bodies. Sober. 


We start laughing at nothing, talking shit, laughing, probably more due to the fact we were sober all of a sudden and thought we were high. 


The decision is made to go for a mission to the beach. We leave the house and wander onto the small coastal town street. "Holy fuck, that street is black, it's like a tunnel mate!!". The streets of this little town had all of a sudden become a vortex, a never ending black hole of nothingness. We laughed and stumbled and fumbled our way to the weird sounding waves. You know the sound, the sound of waves, they're there, just over there, but they sound everywhere, close to your face, yet miles away. 


We sit down on a bench seat facing the beach, and smoke weed. It's fairly typical tripping at this point. 


We decide to wander down the beach, but feel lost, (the path is right by us) but have to scale a set of rocky type reefs to reach the sand. At this point all motor skills are gone, depth perception is FUCKED and my legs are not my own. We do okay, and laugh our way to the beautiful white sandy night sky coated beach. Our friend passes out in the sand. He's okay, he's fine, just needs a rest. He seems asleep to me. 


So me and my other mate sit on the beach. Everything seems to be coming back to reality now, we're tired, and the world seems all the more normal. We have a (what we think was a real person) conversation with a shadowy person on the beach, before he leaves and completely freaks us out. We decide we're being trailed and wake up our mate and go home. 


By the time we got back to the holiday home we are completely normal, drunk and tired if anything. Sitting on the balcony, we grab some drinks, pillows and blankets and just wait for the sunset to come over the sensational ocean. One of us cooks some sausages on the BBQ to fill our stomachs before bed. We take a few swigs of some codeine cough syrup to relax and we all sit back, decide to drop another TWO BLOTTERS of the rest of the "acid" that we had and comment how we might as well finish it all, seeing as it isn't that strong (please understand I am aware that this is very stupid). The last thing spoken of the night is by my best friend, he says "its been in his freezer too long, oh well man, not enough acid is always better than too much acid". It's been five hours since last dose. 


I agree and we all softly fall asleep......


If only we knew what was to come.....


I cannot do more now. I shall finish tomorrow.

Oh my god a trip report with a cliffhanger, are you kidding me? ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)


But seriously, thanks for the story and lesson - we can always use a lesson on this compound. If you finish later and do another proof read to make everything in order I can move this for you to the Trip Reports section (we can leave a link here).

In that case please provide a title for your report, and let us know how experienced you were with BDFly before this experience.


I'm interested to hear what happened next fwiw.

Hello Survived Abortion


I knew it was not DOB because I took some blotters last year - taste was different, and the high too (less bodyload and more psychedelism)


I told at least 16h of INTENSE TRIPPING, but really I tripped for 3 days (residual)


I know it´s rare in europe, but I searched  reports with descritions of ingestions of the 5 compounds in bluelight, erowid and pikhal online - reports with descriptions and doses that shulgin did to DOx: the symptons I felt matched nearest the criteria for bdfly

Bump for any potential interest in hearing about new bromo reports.


Didn't see much in here about combos though.


From what I gather 500 ug is fairly reasonable...

And a 'hole' dose of methoxetamine doesnt do any justice to this beast in helping it further the visual quests although I will say this has been a damn depraved night/morning of Bromo etizolam whiskey beer methoxetamine and 6-APB that started with some ghostbusters watching and now some motherfucker is chopping down the poor ol grass outside ha.

That's quite the combination there. I'd be curious as to what your blood pressure was after adding the MXE and 6-APB.

how is this related to bromo-d-fly? ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) 

but yeah, the lack of reports isnt making this chem any more inviting. i have some blotters that might be real from a few years back, never seriously considered taking them though.

have yet to read a glowing report on it, or find a use for such a potentially dangerous and long lasting chem

Blood pressure didn't change much with the methoxetamine and this was more than 70 mg rectal (but I would say the etizolam factored in a bit), surpised the hell out of me actually how little of my psyche was influenced by the methoxetamine. I decided that once the methoxetamine didn't make me 'hole' or really get anywhere overly interesting that maybe some of that 6-APB would put it in gear, 40 mg up the nose was a fun burn and then nothing much more, have had a hard time staying awake now but I can't stop listening to music and can't really fall asleep all that easy either.


Just a long ass trip that doesn't seem to end with anything saying 'yay this is better than xxx'.


Sure as hell beats the shit out of DOI (compaired to my one trial that was long and very analytical)but I thought I would share my stupidity for those interested. 


T + 19 hours and I have been tired for about a day now but could be awake for a while longer, this is after 3 mg of etizolam, 3.5 beers and about 3-4 shots worth of whiskey.  All other compounds are out of the system and its just a waiting game where I am left wondering if the downers will put me out finally.


Music is fucking fantastic sounding though but I have had the most terrible time just concentrating on one fucking thing... after I check DOC off my to-do list  my thinking is that the DOx familly will be regaurded by me as a *need not revisit again* area. 


But time dilation is sooooo slow with this, that is the one largest benefit, so much significant audio appreciation, every individual note and second, albums that span on forevver! (with the bromo keeping that going obviousy, isn't so much a fun thing after the first 10 hours ha, throwing up during the come-up and feeling like shit was fun but then to have it lead in to just a 'meh' is kinda dissapointing. 


I could try more tricks to bring out any 'magic' this thing has but I have a feeling that with said compound that will be all I am going to get out of it which is a lesson on its own I guess, just a very long look in the mirror and I wasted a bit of time and energy, hopefully this helps someone decide that they don't need to do the same unless they get bored in the future as I did.


Hopefully in the future we can just legalize LSD, good joke right?

In retrospect I will say this compound was able to provide the second best time dilation I have experienced and was able to provide visuals that were probably at the top of the tier for me. 


The downsides are bodyload and lack of insights. If anyone is interested, drink plenty of water before, during, and after dosing this compound. Very dehydrating. Also be prepared to be very unimpressed by any real mental changes besides anxiety and discomfort with a dash of very mild euphoria.


One can for sure feel the brominated feeling of this compound. Wish it was cleaner, could have been better if it was, either way it was interesting that is for sure, not the worst thing I have taken but not the best. The visuals probably would have been the best ever if a cannabinoid was used in combo with it, there is definitely potential for intesnse OEV's thats for sure, just too much 'boring' mental clarity with too much overall focus. 


I didn't find it enlightening or confounding though, just kinda 'OK, wierd shit is happening but why isn't it going anywhere better than this?'.

I just wanted to say since no one said it... combining MXE with serotonin releasers like 6-APB, MDMA, or (in my case) 4-FA is very dangerous as it can lead to serotonin syndrome.  I made the mistake of taking a hole dose of MXE while I was on some 4-FA and it really fucked me up... I felt unwell, I had a terrible headache, and my hangover the next day was scary, I had zero energy, a raging headache, and I got frightening head rushes every time I lifted my head too fast, where I would white out and almost collapse.

I love to hate bromo dragonfly..


5'10" about 150lbs

Dosages taken: 1/2 blotter to one and 1/2 blotters on about 4 sesperate occasions at an unknown ug(was told 500ug but skeptical..) Don't have a trip report to write but I will share a little regarding it.


On one hand its super fun mentally, very easy on the mind and always makes me really giggly. OEVs are simple just shifting/breathing it seems but man are the CEVs awesome. Multi coloured kaleidoscope! Music sounds great. Trails are good especially with LED lights. I can eat after a few hours of ingestion which is weird since most psychedelics make me not have an appetite.

 Gives you waves of high energy and then lethargy and then energy then lethargy. It lasts forever! 12-18hours for me. This stuff is very taxing on my body and any of my friends who have done it with me.. I literally feel like I got hit by a car. The come down is just terrible, yet I still find myself finishing what I have left even though I know how shitty I'll feel. I highly suggest having opiates or benzos for it. I also wouldn't try mixing it with other chemicals as it feels toxic to me..


Overall I think its very fun, just very hard on me physically and has long duration of effects so be prepared.


Sorry it's not more detailed. Any questions feel free to ask.

^Benzo's won't help your ability to communicate, they will just calm you down if you are feeling a bit concerned. I'd be quite wary of taking too high a dose of any benzo due to the potential for it creating a black-out type situation. Not a good combination, but if you feel you need something, take a **very** small dose of a benzo.

I don't think you should take Propranolol, I think it may increase peripheral vasoconstriction. Obviously though, I'm not a doctor so am not really sure....If you are concerned about this, I think you should consider getting some medical assistance. Or just try and call a friend who may have a clearer perspective. 


Above all, just try and relax and enjoy the experience but be conscious of your body and how it is feeling....![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I think so too, willow.


Propanolol is a beta blocker, epi acting on beta-adrenoceptors causes vasodilation which is blocked, and indirectly the balance shifts to alpha adrenoceptors which promote vasoconstriction. I am not a doctor either but as far as I can tell that could be bad, doubly so.


Maybe a sedative would be a good idea, other than that willows advice is just good to follow.

it's very difficult to trip so hard for so long and have to worry about vasoconstriction the whole time.  that kind of drags you back to earth and causes amega bad trip

 in on almost 4mgs and is genuine I've had sheets of it since 2006 or so and it doesn't lose potenc


anyone know if temazepam can be beneficial in this situation? i have a super high benzo tolerance but don't know how it react s with vasoconstriction or other matters i May not be able to consider as I'm plus 8 right now and just need some reassurance from Earth.  will neurontin react in an way?

Temazepam should be fine, any benzo should be to my knowledge.

I am thinking the same thing - I hope someone showed up and was able to provide some help, 4 mg is a _very_ high dose... had I seen this earlier, i'd have adviced more than just taking a benzo.  The two times I took 1 mg was very strong for me.

mygreenbic, please check in when you can.  That's the kind of dose that can cause hospitalizations, I think, so I can't help but be a bit worried.

**Pic**


i need help 

 i took 150mg ambien today and was bummed that it didn't work so i went into my bromo stash and took four one mg blotters from the 2007 European strong batch.  i forgot about the ambien.  would ambien carry any seratonergic activity?  forget the problems with the vasoconstriction at this high off a dose but if i get seratonin syndrome that can cause a hypertensive Crisis which i couldn't imagine the hell that would be caused combined.  Any advice?  I'm twohoursin and have klonopin,  beer,  wine,  neneurontin  ,  magnesium, water,propranolol and remeron.  can any of those help my situation.  the inside of my nostrils ate singing as if it might be ballsy constriction.  i just did a massive dose the other day.  another thing I'm concerned as Is headache.  i have imitrex and propranolol for migraines which are both very potent vadoconstrictors.  z Would ibu interfete? 

And for those who Stent sure if you had bromo     then you didn't.  it's the most evil psychedelic ever experienced.  and I've done hundreds.  it's also unrelenting.  imagine if satan had a bit of avoid that mage him have a bad trip then he shoved a term strip of it down your throat over and over for three days.  along with gi and peripheral dangerous.  I'll edit and include picture 

thanks

So, ten days after taking a 4mg, reportedly "+8" (sic) dose and raising a mini-ruckus  on BL with a desperate plea for help, you delve into your stash, and take another 4mg dose...while on Ambien? Don't worry buddy, you'll be fine, I'm sure the universe won't want to lose a colourful character like you ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Please, stop taking BDFly and get something else that isn't as dangerous especially if you have difficulties with using these substances safely.


Ambien is a hypnotic that can add hallucinogenic action, as if you are dreaming a bit. It shouldn't contribute to the vasoconstriction. Do not take propanolol, alcohol, neurontin, remeron or imitrex.

You can take some magnesium and if necessary some klonopin - though be careful not to overdo it because you don't want to trigger amnesia during this trip. 150 mg of Ambien is a hell of a lot, why did it not work - do you have such a massive tolerance to GABAergics?

Klonopin adds to hypnotic and amnestic effects of Ambien so be very careful with it. Maybe you are fine in that department now, but when the BDFly wears off it stops countering the downer effects. Tricky.


Some types of headache are caused by constricted or widened blood vessels in the brain. BDFly can probably cause some headaches either via vasoconstriction or via a rare paradoxical effect via serotonergic receptors i.e. the opposite of how LSD and psilocin can relieve cluster headaches. In any case I wouldn't take vasoconstrictors, that could make things worse. Vasodilators maybe but that could be tricky. Better just sedatives.

Serotonin, dopamine / norepinephrin blockers like some antipsychotics could theoretically block some of the BDFly action, but for all I know that is a dangerous way to try and abort as well. Remeron is not a good one anyway because it has adrenergic action that can may interact negatively.


Good luck, try to keep moving a little bit to get rid of some energy you may be feeling, and to avoid cramps, but also not TOO much. Ride it out, learn your lesson, get real help if you truly feel in danger. Give away the BDFly to someone who can surely handle using it properly or destroy it. Then rest and recover fully. Then optionally: get another psychedelic that is physically reasonably safe.

OMG! Im so sorry I missed your reply. IT was an awful experience. I was able to handle the mental psychedelic marathon but it is too much on me physically. I have too much of it, I cant stop taking it every time I drink. Im on again. A LOT! And im getting sick from sub withdrawal, can I do h? Im sorry I cant go read all the replies but I am having a mighty difficult time even thinking in words in a linear manor ir that makes any sense. I keep feeling like im falling through the floor every time i take a step but now opiate withdrawl is kicking in. I have like two sheets Im about to throw them away, I cant have this shit near me anymore, it will be the death of me.

Well, Solopsis its not letting me directly reply to or quote you for some reason. I apologize for not checking back, that wasnt cool of me. I know you guys dont want to hear this but Im going through a lot in my life right now with my family and just lost my pet. I have been going all out just to escape reality. I reccomend that NO ONE ACTS LIKE I DO. I have pushed the envelope so many times and for some reason I am still here. Most people wouldnt be so lucky. Bromodragonfly should never have been put out on the market. Its far too dangerous. If there was someone that would irresponsibly sell a ten strip of it and call it acid they could destroy someones life. After I type this im putting it in a bucket of water then dumping it over the hill. Its almost like they put this stuff out here to rub off some of us for their next culture creation  .. I dont want to get into that but if you have never felt horrible, and you really want to feel horrible, take 4mg of bromo while withdrawling from opiods. And I say that aas DONT DO IT. My words are getting scrambled but its such a huge risk I know better and I should be leading by example Ive been around here for a  long time. I apologize to all of of you worrying you and I am definitely holding myself accountable for that. This stuff is evil. Just when you feel some relief boom it comes back at you like five times harder. You never know what the hell its going to do. 

On the medical side of things:

Is it normal to get a sore throat from this ? Because I remember last time my voice was real dry and raspy. Now its dry and painful. And drinking fluids doesnt feel like it does normally. It feels forced. Hard to explain. Ok the letters are rotating at 90 degree angles now and my spine is ablout to jump out of my back from withdrawl . ill try to check back. Thank you guys i love you

![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png) ill be back i always am.

OH yah and to answer your question , I can eat a bottle of klonopin and be ok, I guess I have like one bz receptor that hasnt been downregulated yet.\

Here is the picture I owe you: 

![bromo.jpg](https://www.bluelight.org/community/proxy.php?image=http%3A%2F%2Fs28.postimg.org%2Fe9zqqkpwd%2Fbromo.jpg&hash=8a692dbbaf7eb9d0f57f8b9852c1975c)


and also, Im desperate for comfort right now, this is really taking a toll on me. Ive been taking the klonopin, it helps, and dont be concerned about the doseages of that I have that under control as far as my tolerance, bz is my doc. But there are some things I cant think of right now... Someone dropped me off some lyrica and xanax. I already faced the xanax but what about lyrica? What effects would that have on bromodragonfly? Bromo is purely a potent seratonin agonist right? It doesnt have any other properties does it? So I guess could any of the pharmakinietics of lyrica or neurontin influence the seratonergic or vescular systems, and if so how. I really need comfort with medicine, and Im being extra careful which is why I am coming to you guys looking like a n00b. But i figure its best to ask someone even if you think you know the answer while under the influence of such a potent hallucinogeon. Quite a nasty one too. It feels like a combo of a heavy dose of acid with like the lame affects of amphetamine. If that makes any sense. I would call it psychedelic speed with very little euphoria. And I donrt think I can put off taking my suboxone anymore,... I dont think that the hypertension from opiate withdrawlal would mesh well with vasoconstriction. But I cant think right now on how suboxone effects the seratonin systems. If someone can help me Id greatly appreciate it.

Now stay okay plz. Well good of you to dump it down a hill (@I am the suck, seems like it is being dumped so no need to flush). That wildlife on that hillside is gonna trip something fierce! Yet... in the following post you are talking about combining it again, you didn't end up dumping it?


Come on man, stop risking your health... get rid of it and if you must, get another sort of psychedelic that is at least physically safe like I said.


Be careful with lyrica, not sure how it would interact with BDFly but it works pretty differently than xanax.

Solipsis read the thread again, that was two seperate trips seperated by maybe a week. The reason I didnt flush it is becaues I ddint want that shit to get into the water supply. I used cayenne pepper as a vasodialotor and it worked like a charm. But the problem was the bromo had much longer and stronger of a constricting affect and I think it caused a battle between the two which today maybe in retrospecit it was a mistake. My headache instantly went away and alot of the vascular constriction instantly faded. But slowly it came back, and after waking up today finally after sleeping because of a ton of xanax klonopin neurontin lyrica and alcohol my right hand is tingling and there is a red line traveling down my wrist which really concerns me. Do you think I should go to the hospital? BUt there is really nothing they can do to stop the damage besides amputate right? Thanks you for your assistance in getting me through this. I plead that none of you take 4 mg of strong bromo. I dont even reccomend one mg. The stuff is pure evil. Im starting to wonder if that purdue lab and Nichols were working for the cia to wipe out some drug users. Thats where spice bromo and many other drugs like meph came from. Pff. I feel so run down and tired. Its crazy. I think all the benzos are still working now that the speed affect is gone and I feel freaking exhausted. The only reason Im not sleeping right now is because I wanted to warn people of the dangers and hell I went through, and that if you are in the middle of a constricting crisis cayenne pepper instantly relieves it. Actually after I took a table spoon immediately my headache went away, a huge burst of OEV's instantly appeared, and I felt like super man. It felt like taking a popper or something. Im not saying its safe but it sure is an amazing temporary fix. Research it before you try it. I was desperate and I think it may have saved my life. Thanks again everyone.

You had the same blotters? Let me tell you, that is the only 100% real bromo that I ever witnessed. And I know 100 percent it was bromo for a reason that I cant say. Just think about that. And Im not trying to sell it so I have no reason to make it up. And the fact that Im saying just trust me is that is is the genuine thing should tell you that I have some advanced perfect knowledge about it that I cant talk about. Just think maybe I was there while it was made but thats all you need to think to understsand how I know. Its the strong batch from europe and Im very surprised you got a hold of that because it is very rare those blotters. They were the first batch made onto blotters. And they are 1mg per hit. So becareful people if you come across it. I got rid of most of them but I couldnt get myself to not save a twenty strip for future in a safe place in case Im an old man and there is no more drugs in the world lol. I love you guys and take care. I need to take a major rest, Im not feeling good, that stuff at that kind of dose really puts your body and brain through a lot. 

Peace out ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Yeah I got a ten strip from a friend last year and he told me it super rare and was the last I'll ever see it ever again. Ah I miss those wizards. Sold my last 3 hits to a guy at bonnaroo who is super into rc's and was so happy because he had been looking 7 years for that batch ha I couldn't not let him try it out. RIP BDfly

Sorry but I disagree about nichols. His chemicals were all harmful street drugs like meph, bromo, spice, etc. Shulgin was more of a shaman. I believe Nichols had an agenda. And yes I do believe that it was his fault that they were put out on the street. No 1 broke into purdue and stole the chemical and spread it around the world accept for maybe the cia. 

But anyways I appreciate your concern on the other subjects. I did "get rid" of the other bromo except for a couple ten strips as a keep sake that I left at my girlfriends house in a vault. Someday where it dissappears from the face of the earth it might be qute interesting to have a little stash of it ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png) Could you imagine if someone had that forsight with qualudes? sp

The cayenne actually works really well for the vasoconstricion. I have even been using it when I get headaches from adderall. 

Thanks for the advice on laying off of drugs, but for the most part it has become a part of my life. I quit heroin and am on suboxone ( actually I have been doing heroin on the weekends occasionally but for the most part ive been on suboxone for yearsw), and now I take my benzos as prescribed. Mostly scripts. Its a shame the gov made all the harmless drugs illegal like lsd and we are left with garbage like bromo, bathsalts, and methalone. ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png) But I regress. Take it easy Iamthesuck. Have a good weekend.

First off you have to make sure its a headache from a VASOCONSTRICTING drug. The cayenne pepper dialates. So if you are needing it for bromo or amphetamine, I would start with a little less than a teaspoon. Youll feel relief almost right away. Make sure you dont have a migraine though because a migraine is caused by vasodilation which lets toxins leak into the brain tissue I believe so taking a vasodilator will make it worse. Chances are that since you are in the bromo thread though, it is a vasoconstriction headache and the cayenne will help you. bromodragonfly is a potent seratonin agonist. Seratonin was actually named as a chemical that closes the vessels. Sera meaning blood serum and tonin meaning to open and close the vessils. Imitrex is a migraine medicine and works almost exactly in the same way but is no where near as bromodragonfly. Actually before taking a teaspoon, pour some of the pepper on the table, lick your finger and take a huge dab and swallow it. Its always easier to start out with less and work your way up. I had the absolute worst headache that day and I was amazed at how the cayenne worked. Good luck.

**Identifying Bromo-DragonFLY**


Hi there. I recently acquired a single blotter of what I was told is Bromo-DragonFLY. It was off a trusted source who I also acquire pills, MDMA, ketamine and 2-CB from. Everything I have purchased from him I have tested myself; they have always been pure. 


My main concern is that he bought this in blotter form, and with the mislabelled 2-cb-fly that attributed to many deaths a few years ago I would like to make sure what I have is actually Bromo-DragonFLY.


So is there anyway I can accurately tell which substance in the blotter?

Ah, I understand. I've done a lot of research into Bromo-Dragonfly, and feel comfortable with a range of psychedelics including the NBOMe's at doses of around 3000ug if I recall correctly, so the incredible intensity of this trip is not an issue.


You've answered my main question; I can acquire another blotter from the same sheet to send off for lab analysis.


Thanks for the help, I suppose this thread can be closed now.

Any time...


There may be more acute vasoconstriction concerns with Bromo-Dragonfly also with lower and normal doses whereas NBOMe's may apparently feel fine at higher doses for some people (I personally felt vasoconstriction from them at low doses then stopped trying them), until they may have sudden seizures and as of yet unexplained acute toxicity reactions.


My point is: I recommend you try a low dose first before taking what is supposed to be a "full dose". Tripping ultra hard is not the only issue... knowing how your body handles it is, also.


Good call on the lab analysis, that should solve your problem if they do quantitative analysis for you.

Yeah, bromo-dragonfly is much more dangerous than 2C-B-fly.  I love 2C-B-fly, it feels very benign and beautiful, no vasoconstriction for me at all.  bromo-dragonfly, on the other hand, felt vasoconstrictive and edgy, I'm not a fan.


Also an active dose of 2C-B-fly wouldn't fit on a blotter.

Yes like Solipsis says start small with bromo dragonfly.. I've seen a few people not handle it well physically and then others handle it no problem. You must respect the dragonfly.. it is a very unique  chemical..

This might sound like a stupid question but this is one area of science that I could never quite grasp...  But does bromodragonfly give a risk of  Bromide poisoning? I'M not sure where in a chemical the br has to be and how much of it would cause it to be a risk for Bromism.

Bromo dragonfly I fucking hate you.  If you want to feel like your on a heavy dose of acid without any mental benefit or psychedelic experience outside of corny ass visuals then this drug is for you.  If you like all the physical effects of a heavy dose of acid,  with a stomach full of gas then you'll love it!  And guess what just when you think it might be finally letting up,  oh no,  here comes another five hour peak.  My recommendation to any person who uses this is to load your phone with your favorite music,  tell your family you have a stomach flu,  close your door,  lay down and hit shuffle.  Hang in there you could get lucky and it will last less than 36 hours

Haha mygreenbic send me those extra strip you saved of it, I loved those wizards ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png). Yes it lacked psychedelic depth   mentally but man I always had a blast on it, made me feel like a little kid. Come down is rough though.

I think you were able to sum my feelings about it enough in this post here. Very flu-like and I agree with the duration, this is pretty much the general consensus to those who are familiar with the compound. 


Some other people may enjoy this compound but for a comparison...


It is like saying that someone who has never been much of a beer drinker much less ever had an IPA will like an IPA that only IPA fans like.


Sure there are people who think Hoptimum is the way to go but then there are those who can't even drink a common Budweiser and still some that can barely stomach something watery like a Natty.


If you can't tell what I am saying here, this isn't the beginners level and you usually won't chose to play a game you haven't played on hard. It seems like mygreenbic was having some issues with his controller and chose the last level on expert difficulty. I really hoped for more in depth stories but I am glad you are alive dude, didn't think this thread would still be getting updated.


To further iterate my earlier posting,  this one will make you shit and dehydrate you and make you lay in bed for a day and half and the visuals are the only thing it has to offer, if you are lucky and get enough in that department. 


Everyone is different as can be seen by all the different posts here.

Im starting to wonder if that purdue lab and Nichols were working for the cia to wipe out some drug users. Thats where spice bromo and many other drugs like meph came from. Pff. I feel so run down and tired. Its crazy. I think all the benzos are still working now that the speed affect is gone and I feel freaking exhausted. The only reason Im not sleeping right now is because I wanted to warn people of the dangers and hell I went through, and that if you are in the middle of a constricting crisis cayenne pepper instantly relieves it. Actually after I took a table spoon immediately my headache went away, a huge burst of OEV's instantly appeared, and I felt like super man. It felt like taking a popper or something. Im not saying its safe but it sure is an amazing temporary fix. Research it before you try it. I was desperate and I think it may have saved my life. Thanks again everyone.

Just reposting this because I have questioned his work as well. I agree that it all has scientific validity but also question why certain compounds made my Nichols and company were able to make the rounds in such magnitude when the majority of Shulgin's work has been left untouched.


Food for thought. Both knew each other and worked with each other but both had very different reasons for working with the compounds and I can't say that Shulgin is the better of the two because equal arguments could potentially be made that he was obsessed with only certain compounds and was very biased. 


Personally I am a great fan of Shulgin and his work and think he was working for the greater good of humanity.


If one were to look more into this it would not surprise me to find that there was more to it than meets the eye. Maybe it is just coincidence that Nichols had many compounds make the rounds but maybe it is due to his past students being active in creation of compounds. This kind of talk is all speculation and it is something that a minority of the human race is vaguely knowledgeable about. 


But to get this back on track, I am glad you are alive dude, give us some reports of how this all went down, you have to have some crazy tales to tell, I know there have been worse reports posted here and I feel like you should help people see how this compound behaves by describing it better.

Bromo is unique as hell, nor for the first timer. Also like anything know how it reacts to YOUR body I've seen it act different in 75% of people..I really enjoy it though ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I apologize for the lack of quality of my past reports. the problem is, when you are on bromodragonfly, it is not a relaxing experience, not one where you feel like sitting and typing out your experience. you feel most of the time like you are having a panic attack with fractal visuals being the primary psychedelic effect. by time two to three days have past, and youre finally able to sleep, you are not going to want to sit down and the computer and write a reflection piece. 

I've done plenty of chemicals and this one simply is not pleasurable. sure if you are craving that slant on reality that only some of us understand, and you have zero pot or anything else remotely psychedelic, yet you have like ten sheets of Bromo on hand because you can't sell it because no-one that has tried it once to repeat the mostly negative quarter-week long extravaganza, then maybe it's a good idea to take some. 

I sure hope you have plenty of clonazepam on hand and you are near a toilet. I pray you do not take this compound while camping or with a hot girl for the first time. and above all, I hope that no one sells you this in blotter for calling it lsd. for one to ingest this in an overdose ten fold is going to suffer tremendously if they survive it. then after the psychedelic effects finally wear off, they would be lucky not to lose limbs several days later do to necrosis caused by irreversible vassodialation. I could see this compound as bring enjoyable if you have your own place, a comfortable bed, no over concerned relatives, no obligations and plenty of benzos and opiates. I took about two mgs tonight so if anything different occurs such as euphoria or dissociation that you want to hear to make this compound worth it, then I'll be sure to report it

Yeah bromo-dragonfly seems sketchy and not worth it to me.  I tried it once, and I found it uncomfortable somewhat (I had I think 1mg if I recall), and there was absolutely nothing about it that I couldn't have done better with something else.  Even at that dose I felt some vasoconstriction, and the feeling in my body contained a definitely element on anxiety and tension.

I did a couple of blotters of Bromo again and I don't know how I keep forgetting the heavy element of anxiety involved with this stuff. I'm really going to go through my Klonopin which I can't afford to do. 

how do you guys think seroquel would affect me for aborting a bromo trip?

and do you think baclofen could help with any of the side affects?

a prompt reply would be so greatly appreciated. I thought I had the next few days to myself and it turns out I'm going to be surrounded by important family members for the next couple days in about eight hours. any help would be appreciated, this is a potential psychedelic catastrophe

This guy said it perfrectly. Im going to print this out and read it to myself everytime I am about to dip into my stash of bromodragonFLY. It always makes me miserable. Llke right now. I think it could be killing me but the alcohol is masking the psychedelic side temporarily enough for me to type this. The only reason I ever tqake it is when I run out of adderall and am craving anything that will give me that awake feeling but everytime I tak eit I regret it. This is pure misery and there is zero payoff. i wish I could tell you guys there was something great about this compount but  unless you like horrible anxiety and lsd like body load then you will enjoy this. No mental pay off. Just all the physical effects of lsd times twenty without the ego dissolve. God bless your soul and hope you make it out of this alive. Im either talking to myself or the next person reading this who decides to dose this bs.

I actually like bromo. I find it quite euphoric, although the stimulation can be a bit harsh. If only the stimulation after the psychedelic phase lasted much shorter...

Relax... You better focus on soothing repetitive activities. Sew through the holes in you old socks, or play Super Mario, or whatever. The part that you experienced earlier should be over and things should sweeten up. I think you should avoid alcohol. A low dose of clonazepam could level your mood some. I watch old movies on archive.org.


You'll get better, and better, and better, and better...

the problem is just when I think it gets better, I get hit with another wave that was way harder than the previous.  I have a large collection of bromo sheets. I've done it many times but I think the dose is evenly distributed throughout the blotters . the chemist who made it said it was one mg per hit but every time I take one it's different. this time I took one, then an hour later I decided to take another one because I figured if I'm going to do this I might as well do it all the way. well the second blot was way bitter and it actually started to burn my tongue. it started to freak me out so I spit it out. I'm on what I think is a mega dose. I start tripping so hard (mainly body load) that I kinda start nodding out because it becomes overwhelming. I have tactile sensations in my fingers, pins and needles, so that really freaks me out worrying about vasoconstriction . so I've been taking dabs of cayenne pepper which seems to give me temporary relief from the headaches and tingling toes , fingers, and nose. but I worry about the constant tug of war between the constriction and dialation and it worries me if it can cause more harm than good. this is really making me run through my rx of Klonopin and I'm beginning to fear I won't have enough to last to my next script throwing me into benzo withdrawal.

oh no another wave is hitting me. the letters are waving all over the place. do you guys think seroquel could help or would it potentially cause a dire situation. my body is exhausted from being up going in 48 hours bitmmmmmmmmmmmmmm

 shit what's happening. am I going to be alright? I went and desperately got a couple bags of good dope and it felt so good for about forty five minutes until the bromo washed it away like it was it's bitch.  +nb/bbbbbb vvff vbbbbvvvvvvcccvccccccccccccccccccccccccccvvcccvcvvcvvvcvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv

Seroquel will abort the trip. I'm not sure how it will work with a long lasting psychedelic but given the fact it's been so long it will most likely do the job.

Yeah any antipsychotic will abort the trip, benzo's would help too if you can get them.

It should. I'm not one hundred percent sure on all BDFlys pharmacology. The best thing I could tell you is to compare and contrast the anti psychotics pharmacology with BDFly. If BDs an agonist at one while the anti psychotic is an antagonist at another then it would will quell those effects.

My experience with NBOMe drugs was similar. I am lucky I survived. I am lucky I didn't kill another person accidentally. I was naive, innocent, and misguided. Other psychedelic drugs are pricier, though they aren't expensive. Other psychedelic drugs are also safer. I wish I had extracted DMT or grown mushrooms instead. How could we prevent others from making similar bad decisions? How could we protect other people from these risks?

I think the best thing we can do is to spread real information, and actually inform people.  The majority of people taking stupid risks with drugs without knowing about them are young people, who receive all of their "information" from their dealer or from "the word on the street".  This leads to all kinds of misinformation and danger.  If we were able to educate all drug users properly I believe we'd have a much less severe drug problem in the world.  Which is why I love Bluelight. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


Of course, to educate yourself here you have to be a person who is interested in being educated, who took the initiative to come here and learn.

there is a huge problem. people are given samples of rcs to write false reports on certain rcs making them look a lot better and less dangerous than they actually are. shills. I know this for a fact, I've seen the offers on reddit and people accepting it. only take your information from trusted bluelighters and do your own research. share the info you find.. if everyone does this we will have a chance. the people behind the rcs are the same ones responsible for the illegal street drugs. the government and masons. they will do anything to sell their drugs, it's mega money. be careful and support your peers

It's not trick or treat.., if there are not many downsides reported doesn't mean there aren't any...


Don't tally positives too much against negatives when you read boards, but add up your warning signs. The old 'absence of evidence is not evidence of absence' logical fallacy adage!


Yes I've accepted a sample in my lifetime in an agreement something like that, only without going back on anything I have only ended up writing true and fair accounts lol.

Same here.  I no longer have much anonymity here because I have been forthcoming in my posts and experiences. But at this point I don't really care, and I don't care to hide behind a new sn either.  If that's the price of being honest, then whatever, because no one's going to benefit from a bunch of lies.  At least I know the BL community and lurkers can benefit from my small sacrifices, and hopefully go into trips with some confidence.  ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


On a side note, I'm really surprised there is hardly any interest in DOPr.  I know where the sweet spot is now, and it's a really great chem.  I'll be finishing up the rest of what I have in about a month or two.  I was hoping it would help or somewhat guide others, but lol, it doesn't seem like anyone wants to try it.  I wanted to compare other people's experiences with my own simply for analysis' sake.


At one point in time I wanted to try this one, as well as Datura, but after learning about them here on BL that motivation died in an instant.  There are some roads out there that aren't meant to be traversed by humans.  Heh.

Haha, yeah it is.  I was reading this thread from the start too, and the "scraps and bickering" one...it got off topic and the mods were getting mad...=O


Thanks.  I hope you find some, in fact I want to re-up too but I can't find any more either.  I put a lot of effort into those reports, and instead of fully enjoying the trip by itself I took notes and spent time analyzing the effects.  It was almost like working...jk.


But yeah, I'll end it here by saying BDFly seems to be unresearched quite a bit, even at this stage.  It doesn't seem like it should be taken by humans either.

If you get it right it's a perfectly fine chemical. It's just history that the majority of humans have problems using the potent ones. I've used BDFly probably ten times or so and every time but one was good. The one time it wasn't, was my own fault for consuming so many chemicals in combination with, then losing it for a bit. Even that was a fun time I just look back at and laugh about.

Oh, cool.  Did you end writing a trip report or posting about it?  I want to know how one has experienced this, since I just got past reading about hypothetical trials and non-trials.  -_-  Admittedly, I haven't read this whole thread yet, but I will by tonight.


I was deeply interested in this chem a long time ago, (along with a few others like 2C-T-7) but I must say I'm not up for it anymore.  I would just enjoy reading about them, besides on Erowid.

I should've written one but it's not something I do to often. I definitely posted about them. I think, for instance BDFly has far more merits and even a bit safer, though more potent in certain regards. It should only be used by those who are experienced trippers though. It's strong and lasts a long time. Not the greatest but definitely not the worst.

Okay, sounds good.  Hopefully I run into them somewhere here, as I am a fiend for reading the huge threads.  I like how so many have stayed consistent throughout the years.  ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


It's definitely a potent one, which is one of the main reasons it interested me.  It seems to have a steep dose response curve as well.  Ahh, I'll go back to reading.  Thanks for the response.

How is not safe? The same way nearly everything is, when used improperly....! As long as you follow the correct dosage curve, you shouldn't have problems. Safety profiles are not built on personal feelings, or anecdotal evidence, but hard fact. The only fact disregarding it's safety is the serve vasoconstriction, but I've never seen any reports where it was a danger at the right doses. Also is you read the post, it uses the word, "safer", no where did I advocate it as a highly safe chemical, just IMO seemingly safer than 25I.

Wow.  Between doing random stuff and eating a late dinner, I finally finished reading this whole thing.


Lots of random stuff, arguments, hypotheticals and questioning.  Maybe 1 or 2 trials with details until page 23, then it blows up.  But page 18 has some scary info.  Seems like anywhere from 400-1000mics are the standard dose, with up to a 36 hour duration and worries about vasoconstriction and an overall feeling of toxicity.  Some deaths mentioned from OD'ing, as well as physical side effects from around 4 mg and up, but with 2mg being labeled as too high.  Lots of psychedelia except for an interestingly empty headspace.  Total clearheaded-ness.


But I also found it fascinating mygreenbic pretty much abused it and seems fine.  Damn, those are a lot of hits lol.


Just a quick summary for those looking for this kind of information.  The moral of the story seems to be Watch Your Dose!  OD is possible for anything, whether it's this, DOPr, legal/illegal substances, water, vitamins, orange juice...


The potential for DNA intercalation is a huge turn off though.  Hopefully that's not the case at normal doses.  It does sound like one hell of a substance!  Maybe I'd try it just once...![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

Hah, thanks.  Extracting that info from a lot of "popcorn material" was giving me a bit of a headache, but the thread was a worthwhile read.  The longevity of this one was what interested me in it in the first place.  Those are some wild trials that you went through, btw.

we were given bromo like a litre from a contact of a mate down south, it'd been buried for three years, I did small doses on sugar lumps n my mates wanted them, but I've never seen anyone take it without getting fx lasting into all next day and poor circulation n mottled skin etc.


so glad we deliberately dosed extra low. neone who wasn't with our crew were given advice++ n I'd sell four in a block of foil.


we threw the remaining dosed lumps away we only took twenty to glasto but really messed few mates up on their second third cube in the trip...


really speedy style angry loopy comedowns, even after visuals shortness of breath n unable to sleep next day.


not like any other drug other than DOB etc bod etc which ppl were missold in 70s said it felt same.


its not something I'd recommend. it got reburied by lad who gave me it n we didn't pay him either there's loads about. ppl really thought it was gonna be bargain super 2cb/acid n the amounts that could be picked up cheap mean itll come back round time n time again.


I got blotters with zzz emoticon n 1mg etiz the time after n they were best ever. I don't do psychs for ppl nemore rather have a strip of downers for mates on ropey comedowns from eph etc etc 


the bromo had three dosed liquid n we didn't know which batch wed been given in its 'pure' form n that's before degradation and or mistakes dosing...


I worry the blanket ban will brig this back esp to psy scene as its being sat on all over the place by ppl who are less scrupulous than us...


I gave lil hits of the lasts of my 2cb for eager ppl who'd never had it before or any psychedelic...


I wanna get 1plsd before ban as this stuff is inhrrintly nasty short term vaso constrictors are with their risks but it took two days for each person to get rid of pains and mottled skin esp in legs. mentally as I said my best mates would go on rants the next day and would be flying even off a mild dose...


we couldn't find a dose small enough that didn't have side fx...


be careful. if my mate didn't owe £££s I'd of tipped it away, like I did with my GBL litre after a year as my doses were ramping up n I eventually was unrousable n after I kept occ doses but the ease of benzos allowed me to not worry about emergency downers.


1plsd should be left off ban list as should benzos for a while. the most toxic and most criminally used cuts should be banned. it should come in in stages.


there's so many drugs I'll never get to do like dipt etc but for the sake of ticking everything off my list I'd say to anyone don't bother with bromo dragonfly I was really concerned as a medic how it affected my mates who'd asked me to get hold of some for our club night\crew.


its not about in the north west. its all friends of friends scoring doses but thankfully it never widely took off. really was litres of dilute solution in groups at one point few years back n every now n again ppl do dose n fx are same.


not much u can do if u got ur heart set on it but outdoor festivals not best place , but cardiovascular fxcare solo unpredictable n everyone once over it would prefer to drop then drop again a acid tab not one person out a fifty preferred it. like I said the speedy n on off psychological fx are like a dream rc to get the lot banned.


we gotta be responsible as a community...

I know you had real bdf because you described what I weren't through multiple times in a perfect manor. When I used to get pure LSD blots all the time, I would take four or five for a mystical ego dissolving life enhancing experience.

If I had been sold bdf in say a ten strip and told it was lsd, I can't imagine the horror of taking like five blotters dosed a mg per blot at a rave or something surrounded by a huge crowd. 

I agree that it should be banned.

Ok well i received a police report on my blotters which I still have more of.  They read. 900ug of bromo a piece.  I took three today,  usually I have a bad experience with this but wanted to give it another chance as I got to try a huge bottle of doc that is now gone and I miss like an old girlfriend that I will never see again.  So far so good.  Diminished visuals but we'll see.  I'll be back.

Honestly I'm surprised you went back given you usually have a bad experience.  2700ug of DOB-dragonfly is a high dose, good luck with that...


You can still find DOC online too.  I totally get missing DOC, if I hadn't acquired a lifetime supply I'd be missing it too.  But DOB-dragonfly is no substitute.

I've had some Bromo-dragonfly blotters of unknown dosage sleeping in my closet since I bought them off of the original Silk Road in 2012. I lost the information about dosage along with all of my purchase records when Silk Road was shut down.


I have the house to myself for 72 hours this weekend, so I thought I would try it. (From reading this thread, I am not expecting a fantastic experience, but I just gotta catch 'em all, as it were.)


The blotters are about 1cm square, non-perforated beige or tan (what looks like) construction paper. There is some non-uniformity in color, which I hope aren't hot spots. Has anyone encountered these before?


I just took 1/16th of a blotter as an allergy dose. It was surprisingly bitter. I chewed for about 15 seconds and then swallowed. If I feel nothing, I will be taking 1/4th of a blotter on Saturday morning. If I feel something, but it isn't unpleasant, I will be taking 1/8th of a blotter. If I feel something unpleasant, I will call this off. Can't be too cautious. I should mention that I have no tolerance to any drugs except my prescription Concerta.


As an old, I don't get a lot of opportunity to use these rare RCs, but hopefully I can get around to working my way up to a full blotter some time within the next ten years.

Honestly I didn't like bromo-dragonfly, and I am someone who loves DOC/etc and pretty much all long-lasting, stimulating psychedelics.  I only tried it once, at 1mg, but I found no real redeeming qualities.  There was vasoconstriction, and the headspace was not anything special, and the body feeling was mildly uncomfortable.  It lasted for like 24 hours, too.  But nevertheless I'd be curious to hear your report if you do decide to try it.  I recall some people enjoying it.  Though it's been a long time.  Wish I'd written a trip report but for some reason I didn't.

It's t+5h for my allergy test of 1/16th of a blotter.


I was almost sure I tasted it at t+2h.


I am at a Shulgin -/+. No pupil dilation. No signs of vasoconstriction. I think I feel stimulated, but nothing that can't be explained by placebo and Concerta.

I wonder if it's possible that BRDF's MAOI properties could be potentiating my Concerta? Anyway, I won't be taking Concerta on the weekend.


I think I'm OK for 1/4th of a blotter.

I had a couple experiences with this one around 10 years ago. Can't really remember it but my notes suggested I enjoyed it a lot. Many references to strong visuals. Have fun exploring!

5:45 Bromo-DragonFly blotter unknown dose 1/4 of a blotter buccal, went back to sleep

8:20 moved blotter under tongue after seeing a few convincing dreams of doing it.

8:30 chewed and swallowed now-tasteless blotter. no effects so far

8:54 doing housework, super hungry

9:15 first alert

10:45 (t+5) I am lightly stimulated, slightly elevated mood, little-to-no appetite suppression, slight tightness in scrotum (vasoconstriction), no hint of psychedelia

t+5 should be the peak, so I don't feel any danger from, say, maybe vaping some 2C-D later to see if I can take this anywhere.

I guess I will be doing a 1/2 blotter next long weekend.


Would you say this is consistent with 1/4th of a 1mg blotter (i.e. 250 micrograms)?

I only ever tried 1mg so I'm not sure, honestly

14:11 35mg 2C-D rectal


14:45 onwards 50mg 2C-D in vape


15:20 This is fun and all, but I am reminded that if I had wanted to be healed rather than just experiment, I would be taking something like 4-HO-MET instead.


(Don't get me wrong, this is fun.)

I forgot to post an update the next day, but I was able to fall asleep at 2am without needing benzos. Still waiting for an opportunity to try a 1/2 blotter. (Maybe during New Year holidays?)

BDF is imho one of prime examples of what's wrong with RC world, drug world in general. For me it's a beautiful substance I am not likely getting any-time soon if ever again. What were problems with it? Just like many new drugs it was regularly dosed far too high and significant difference between two isomers was nowhere near enough explored on any level. I suspect that most people that had good experience with it, like I did had pure isomer and not racemic substance. And what isomer I had, more or less potent, I really don’t remember any-more but I do remember that 0.5mg produced great effects, not that unlike lowish dose of 2c-b, like around 20mg or where you start getting visuals but with a certain LSD like quality, certainly easily recognised not to be LSD by experience person but in fact in this range in many aspects much more like it than DOC, DOI and nbome’s. I have usually gone for high doses of most psychedelics be it phenetylamines or tryptamines and found most substances disappointing in a low range (for example 20mg of 2c-b did not do it for me but doses of 30mg+ made me enjoy it) and no matter that I mentioned BDF being like 2c-b, more grown up version of 2c-b (but not like TMA-2, which I also find a bit like a more grown up version of 2c-b but with many mescaline like qualities present) but BDF really did felt like something I could call a candy psychedelic substance in that low dose and some LSD like qualities that make it plausible that someone inexpedience thought was in fact taking weak LSD because of such a long come up. Such a positive effects in low dose and quite nice in somewhat bigger (max I did was 1 tab and it was dosed at about 1mg) made me wonder if most negative experiences were OD’s and/or one isomer being significantly different. There was almost no body load present ime, in fact less than with most psychedelics. Some other people I know who tried it also enjoyed it. Beside one, one who stole my stash and eat a huge dose of it. Luckily that person survived, had no lasting consequences and even told me it was what she needed even so it took a long time until complete physical and mental recovery she was gone trough it even without hospitalization. Sole fact that person survived idk how exactly big dose, but no question massive makes me wonder even more if one isomer is maybe really significantly more dangerous.
