## Subjective Experience

Although it was referenced in the 1960's, hexen wasn't synthesised until 2011. It
finally began to appear on the markets towards the end of 2015. Frequently
presented as a short acting cathinone with relatively limited residue-stimulation, it
rapidly became popular, particularly in the United States

As heavy redosing and compulsive binging is often referred to on Internet forums, I
take particular care in this area. As a precautionary barrier, I set aside the maximum
I am prepared to sample during this session, and place the rest of the supply well
beyond reach.

I divide 50mg into 5 lines of 10mg each. Whether I snort them all depends upon how
the afternoon rolls. I place another 32mg in a drawer, in case I decide to extend into
the evening.

82mg will therefore be the absolute maximum I can sample today, with a built-in
decision point at 50mg.

```
T+0:00 I insufflate 10mg. [3:15pm]
```
```
T+0:15 I feel an ever-so-slight stimulation, and I am noticeably warmer.
Noting that I am around threshold at this stage, I decide to insufflate the next
10mg. This should take me into light territory, where I should feel something
more pronounced.
```
```
T+0:45 The previous 30 minutes have flown by. Granted, I was busy installing
software, but nonetheless, it whizzed. I feel stimulated and quite happy. As the
first 10mg must be fully effective, I insufflate a third line, taking the overall
dose to 30mg.
```
```
I notice that there is some jaw tension, and that my pupils are slightly dilated.
```
```
T+1:00 The experience seems to have settled on to a plateau now. I feel pretty
good, with slight euphoria, and I am definitely stimmed, and warm.
```
```
I feel the sense of a slight headache in the background, but it isn’t sufficient to
cause discomfort.
```
```
T+1:15 I am quite buzzed and elevated, but not flying. Certainly, I am
functional in the sense that I could perform any task required. However, I am
well aware that I am wired and I am happy to roll with it.
```
```
As it is 30 minutes since the last line, I decide to insufflate the fourth. I am
now up to 40mg in total.
```
```
Is there any horn? Yes, there is. It is not up to methamphetamine or
amphetamine levels, but it is strong, and fully available. Those forum posts on
extended porn binges do make sense.
```
```
T+1:30 The experience is now slightly more intense than earlier. I am
consciously drinking water to keep my fluid intake high, as I am still warm
and obviously pumping.
```
```
T+1:45 I insufflate the fifth 10mg line. I am now on 50mg, having consumed
the whole of the primary batch.
```
```
T+2:00 I am well in control of myself and riding on a pleasant plateau. My
pupils remain semi dilated.
```
```
There is no doubt that I am enjoying the experiment. This has an edge that
makes it very recreational, whilst enabling normal functionality to varying
levels of capability.
```

```
T+2:45 I am still rolling at the same level but I feel a sense of being slightly
weary.
```
```
As I feel no ill-effects I take the decision to extend. I insufflate 8mg of the
optional 32mg batch, splitting the remainder into three equal lines.
```
```
T+3:30 As I feel I am tiring again, at least mentally, I insufflate another 8mg,
and then another 8mg 30 minutes later.
```
```
T+4:15 I insufflate the final 8mg of the secondary batch. The pre-ordained
limit of 82mg has now been reached.
```
```
I can see how some people binge on this and consume ridiculous amounts. It
is very moreish, yet the comparatively painless snorting gives the impression
that it is mild, which isn’t the case.
```
```
It is now 7:30pm. I hope to slowly come-down from here and land towards
midnight, and in theory, have a good night’s sleep.
```
```
T+6:45 It is now 10pm, so as a harm mitigation measure, I eat a bowl of
muesli and drink a glass of orange juice.
```
```
At 11pm I retire to bed.
```
The night’s sleep was not good, or at least, the first part of it wasn’t. I lay tossing and
turning for several hours, and could only fall into slumber by taking 1mg of etizolam,
which worked well.

In the morning I suffered the usual hangover symptoms. I felt mentally drained and
distant, and tired.

I felt nothing like as bad as I did following my forays with some of the infamous
hangover stims, or even with MDMA, but regardless, this was a major factor for
much of the day. I suspect that had I continued to binge this could have been
significantly worse.

I undertook the classic program for recovery, including vitamin pills, 5-HTP, exercise
and food.

Hexen is often considered to be relatively forgiving, or even benign. I would suggest
emphasis on the word relatively. At high doses, it can certainly take its toll, and the
urge to redose is definitely strong.

This is not a drug not to take liberties with. The gentle climb and overall placidity can
be deceptive. Note also that was one of those occasions upon which I retrospectively
believe I dosed too highly.
