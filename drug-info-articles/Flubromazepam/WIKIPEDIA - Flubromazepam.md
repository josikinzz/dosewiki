# Flubromazepam
*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flubromazepam*

Flubromazepam is a benzodiazepine derivative which was first synthesized in 1960, but was never marketed and did not receive any further attention or study until late 2012 when it appeared on the grey market as a novel designer drug.
It is a structural analog of phenazepam in which the chlorine atom has been replaced by a fluorine atom.
An alternate isomer, 5-(2-bromophenyl)-7-fluoro-1,3-dihydro-2H-1,4-benzodiazepin-2-one or "iso-flubromazepam", may have been sold under the same name.
