5-EAPB, also known as 5-(2-(ethylamino)propyl)benzofuran, is a potentially entactogenic amphetamine and benzofuran which is structurally related to 5-MAPB and 5-APB. It might be predicted to show similar effects to these drugs in humans, but the pharmacology of 5-EAPB remains unstudied as of 2020.
5-EAPB is similar in structure to compounds such as 5-APB which are claimed to be agonists of the 5-HT2C receptor as well as a triple monoamine reuptake inhibitor, however 5-EAPB is not listed as an example in this patent, and it is not yet established to what extent the activity of 5-EAPB resembles that of 5-APB.

## Toxicity

Three people in their 30s were hospitalised after each taking approximately 500 mg of 5-EAPB, one of whom later died in hospital, whilst attending Brownstock music festival in Essex, UK on August 31, 2013.
