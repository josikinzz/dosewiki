**4-Hydroxy-N-ethyl-N-propyltryptamine** (also known as **4-HO-EPT** or **Eprocin** ) is a novel synthetic [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) substance of the [tryptamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tryptamine) chemical class that produces [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) effects when [administered](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Route_of_administration) . It is structurally related to [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) ( **4-HO-DMT** ), the active component in [psilocybin mushrooms](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocybin_mushrooms) , and produces similar effects.

Very little data exists about the pharmacological properties, metabolism, and toxicity of 4-HO-EPT. It has no history of human use before being sold online as a [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) in 2016. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] It remains obscure and is either used recreationally or for research purposes.

Unlike other more popular 4-subbed tryptamines, **Eprocin** isn't really visual, it mostly enhances colors and makes them more "neon-ish". It has a strong euphoric body high (some users compare it to opiate body feelings). Mindset is usually light and positive.

## Chemistry

4-HO-EPT, or 4-hydroxy-N,N-diethyltryptamine, is a synthetic indole molecule of the [tryptamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tryptamine) class. Tryptamines share a core structure comprised of a bicyclic indole heterocycle attached at R 3 to an amino group via an ethyl side chain. 4-HO-EPT is substituted at R 4 of its indole heterocycle with a hydroxyl functional group OH−. It also contains a propyl and ethyl chain bound to the terminal amine R N of its tryptamine backbone ( [EPT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/EPT) ).

## Pharmacology

Like with most [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) tryptamines, 4-HO-EPT is thought to act principally as a [5-HT2A](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin#The_5-HT_system) [partial agonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist#Agonists) . The psychedelic effects are believed to come from 4-HO-EPT's binding efficacy at the 5-HT 2A receptors. However, the role of these interactions and how they result in the psychedelic experience continues to remain elusive.

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*

## Toxicity and harm potential

The toxicity and long-term health effects of recreational 4-HO-EPT use do not seem to have been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dose is unknown. This is because 4-HO-EPT is a [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) with very little history of human usage.

Anecdotal evidence from people within the community who have tried 4-HO-EPT suggests that there are no negative health effects attributed to simply trying the it by itself at low to moderate doses and using it very sparingly (but nothing can be completely guaranteed). [Independent research](https://www.google.com/) should always be done to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe before consumption.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this substance.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

4-HO-EPT is not habit-forming, and the desire to use it can actually decrease with regular consumption. Like with most [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) , it is most often thought to be self-regulating.

Tolerance to the effects of 4-HO-EPT is built almost immediately after ingestion. After that, it takes about 3 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 7 days to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). 4-HO-EPT presents cross-tolerance with all [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) , meaning that after the consumption of 4-HO-EPT all psychedelics will have a reduced effect.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **[Lithium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_(medication))** - Lithium is commonly prescribed for the treatment of [bipolar disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder) . There is a large body of anecdotal evidence that suggests taking it with [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) significantly increases the risk of [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) and [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) . As a result, this combination is strictly discouraged.
- **[Cannabis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cannabis)** - Cannabis may have an unexpectedly strong and unpredictable synergy with the effects of 4-HO-EPT. Caution is advised with this combination as it can significantly increase the risk of adverse psychological reactions like [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) , and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) . Users are advised to start off with only a fraction of their normal cannabis dose and take long breaks between hits to avoid unintentional overdose.
- **[Stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants)** - Stimulants like [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) , [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) or [methylphenidate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylphenidate) affect many parts of the brain and alter [dopaminergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) function. This combination can increase the risk of [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) , and [thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops) . This interaction may also result in an elevated risk of [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) . [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol)** - Tramadol is well-documented to lower the seizure threshold and [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) may act to trigger seizures in susceptible individuals. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

## Legal status

Due to its relative obscurity, the possession and sale of 4-HO-EPT is unscheduled in most countries.

- **Germany** : 4-HO-EPT is controlled under the NpSG ( *New Psychoactive Substances Act* ) as of July 18, 2019. Production and import with the aim to place it on the market, administration to another person, placing it on the market and trading is punishable. Possession is illegal but not punishable. The legislator considers it possible that orders of 4-HO-EPT are punishable as an incitement to place it on the market.
- **Switzerland** : 4-HO-EPT is not controlled under Buchstabe A, B, C and D. It could be considered legal.
- **United Kingdom** : 4-HO-EPT is a Class A drug in the United Kingdom as a result of the tryptamine catch-all clause.
- **United States** : 4-HO-EPT is unscheduled in the United States. It may be considered an analogue of [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) (which is a Schedule I drug under the Controlled Substances Act). As such, the sale for human consumption or the use for illicit non-medical or industrial intents and purposes could be prosecuted as crimes under the Federal Analogue Act.

4-HO-EPT, also known as 4-hydroxy-N-ethyl-N-propyltryptamine or as eprocin, is a psychedelic drug of the tryptamine family, which is structurally related to psilocin (4-HO-DMT). It was encountered as a novel designer drug in Japan by 2021.

## Use and effects

4-HO-EPT was not included nor mentioned in Alexander Shulgin's book TiHKAL (Tryptamines I Have Known and Loved).

## Interactions

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

4-HO-EPT is a potent full agonist of the serotonin 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, and 5-HT2C receptors. It has one to two orders of magnitude greater potency as a serotonin 5-HT2A and 5-HT2B receptor agonist than as a serotonin 5-HT2C receptor agonist. The drug also shows affinity for other serotonin receptors, such as the serotonin 5-HT1A and 5-HT6 receptors. 4-HO-EPT produces the head-twitch response, a behavioral proxy of psychedelic effects, in rodents.

### Pharmacokinetics

The metabolism of 4-HO-EPT has been studied.

## Chemistry

### Analogues

Analogues of 4-HO-EPT include ethylpropyltryptamine (EPT), 5-MeO-EPT, 5-fluoro-EPT, 4-HO-MPT, 4-HO-PiPT, 4-HO-DET, and 4-HO-DPT, among others.

## Society and culture

### Legal status

#### United Kingdom

4-HO-EPT is illegal in the United Kingdom as a result of the Psychoactive Substances Act of 2016.

#### United States

4-HO-EPT may be considered an analogue of psilocin, which is a Schedule I drug under the Controlled Substances Act. As such, the sale for human consumption would be illegal under the Federal Analogue Act.
