Ethylone, also known as 3,4-methylenedioxy-N-ethylcathinone (MDEC, βk-MDEA), is a recreational designer drug of the phenethylamine, amphetamine, and cathinone chemical classes. It is the β-keto analogue of MDEA ("Eve"). Ethylone has only a short history of human use and is reported to be less potent than its relative methylone. In the United States, it began to be found in cathinone products in late 2011.
Very little data exists about the pharmacological properties, metabolism, and toxicity of ethylone, and although several ethylone-related deaths have been reported, the cause of death was not due to ingestion of ethylone.
