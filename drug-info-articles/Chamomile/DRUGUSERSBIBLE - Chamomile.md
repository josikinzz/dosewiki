## Subjective Experience

I’ve used everything from supermarket tea bags to tea pigs to raw chamomile flowers.
Indeed, even though I didn’t really like the taste much (it was bland and relatively
boring), I used to drink it regularly during the evenings simply to avoid caffeine.
Unfortunately, in terms of psychoactively, I might as well have been drinking hot
water. Despite my best endeavours I never got anything from it.

However, there are so many claims that it sedates or relaxes I can only assume that
either it is just not for me personally or that it is somehow extraordinarily subtle or
temperamental. Either way, I gave up on it a long time ago.

Note that despite this and perhaps surprisingly, Wikipedia states that it “has the
potential to cause adverse interactions with numerous herbal products and
prescription drugs”. A number of other side effects are also reported.
