Dose.Wiki is maintained on [GitHub](https://github.com/josikinzz/dosewiki) and curates **{{compoundCount}}** published substances with normalized dosage, duration, effect, and interaction metadata. The original dataset is sourced from [rc.community](https://rc.community).

- Browse the [Substance Index](#/substances) to pivot across **{{categoryCount}}** psychoactive and chemical groupings and open full profiles.
- Inspect reported outcomes inside the [Subjective Effects](#/effects) catalog covering **{{effectCount}}** tracked phenomena.
- Review combination guidance on the [Interactions](#/interactions) hub as risk annotations continue to expand.
- Audit edits or draft new entries in the [Dev Tools](#/dev/edit) workspace, which mirrors the live JSON schema.

Every surface reads from the [articles dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/josikinzz/dosewiki/main/src/data/articles.json). Use the global search in the header to jump straight to any record or open a mechanism detail via the badges on each substance.
