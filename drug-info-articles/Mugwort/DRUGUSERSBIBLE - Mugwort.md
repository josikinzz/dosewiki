## Subjective Experience

Mugwort has a lengthy history of herbal use, and is immersed in folk tradition,
certainly in the UK, where it tends to grow as a weed. With respect to the latter, it is
even present in my own garden.

Given this commonality, it can’t be psychoactive, can it? The answer is yes it can.

As I wasn’t proficient enough to identify it at the time of testing, I ordered from a
well known online vendor. I made a huge pot of tea, and drank it over perhaps half
an hour. It wasn’t great to taste, but was manageable.

Lo and behold a mild sedation soon emerged. This was nothing to write home about,
but it was strong enough to be sure that it wasn’t a placebo effect. However, it was
when my head hit the pillow that the action really started.

The dreams were lucid and vivid, particularly the last one. I recall the dream in
question to this day. I existed on a Facebook page. This was neither exciting nor
worrying: it was simply where I was in the dream.

What was different, however, was that when I awoke and went back to sleep, I was
immediately back into Facebook, albeit on a different page. This repeated itself again
and again, to the point at which I was no longer comfortable and wanted to escape.

Of course, escape I eventually did, and I awoke fully.

As this was my first dream herb experience it had taken me by surprise, particularly
as I had no pre-conceived ideas regarding the nature of these manifestations and
effects.

Another aspect I discovered was that it doesn’t seem to be possible to chase the
dreams, at least for me personally. I subsequently repeated the experiment several
times, on each occasion with less effect.

There thus appears to be some sort of dream tolerance in play. I have no idea how
long this lasts, or whether the vivid nature of the first mugwort dream can ever be
repeated. The only way to determine this will be to rerun the exercise in a few
months, which I will endeavour to do.

I should point out that this does not appear to apply to everyone, as there are many
Internet reports which do claim success with frequent and regular use. It should also
be noted that some people smoke it instead of making tea.

Overall, this is a very interesting plant, and well worthy of further exploration.
