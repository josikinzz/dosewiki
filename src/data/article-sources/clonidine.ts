### Mechanism of action

Clonidine is primarily an alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonist which causes central hypotensive and anti-arrhythmogenic effects.
2
The alpha-2 adrenoceptor is coupled to the G-proteins G
o
and G
i
.
2
G
i
inhibits adenylyl cyclase and activates opening of a potassium channel that causes hyperpolarization.
2
Clonidine binding to the alpha-2 adrenoceptor causes structural changes in the alpha subunit of the G-protein, reducing its affinity for GDP.
2
Magnesium catalyzes the replacement of GDP with GTP.
2
The alpha subunit dissociates from the other subunits and associates with an effector.
2
The stimulation of alpha-2 adrenoceptors in the locus coeruleus may be responsible for the hypnotic effects of clonidine as this region of the brain helps regulate wakefulness.
2
Clonidine can also decrease transmission of pain signals at the spine.
2
Finally clonidine can affect regulators of blood pressure in the ventromedial and rostral-ventrolateral areas of the medulla.

### General Function

Transporter that mediates the transport of endogenous and microbial zwitterions and organic cations (PubMed:10215651, PubMed:15107849, PubMed:15795384, PubMed:16729965, PubMed:20601551, PubMed:22206629, PubMed:22569296, PubMed:29530864). Functions as a Na(+)-dependent and pH-dependent high affinity microbial symporter of potent food-derived antioxidant ergothioeine (PubMed:15795384, PubMed:29530864, PubMed:33124720). Transports one sodium ion with one ergothioeine molecule (By similarity). Involved in the absorption of ergothioneine from the luminal/apical side of the small intestine and renal tubular cells, and into non-parenchymal liver cells, thereby contributing to maintain steady-state ergothioneine level in the body (PubMed:20601551). Also mediates the bidirectional transport of acetycholine, although the exact transport mechanism has not been fully identified yet (PubMed:22206629). Most likely exports anti-inflammatory acetylcholine in non-neuronal tissues, thereby contributing to the non-neuronal cholinergic system (PubMed:22206629, PubMed:22569296). Displays a general physiological role linked to better survival by controlling inflammation and oxidative stress, which may be related to ergothioneine and acetycholine transports (PubMed:15795384, PubMed:22206629). May also function as a low-affinity Na(+)-dependent transporter of L-carnitine through the mitochondrial membrane, thereby maintaining intracellular carnitine homeostasis (PubMed:10215651, PubMed:15107849, PubMed:16729965). May contribute to regulate the transport of cationic compounds in testis across the blood-testis-barrier (PubMed:35307651)

**Clonidine** (known by the trade names **Catapres** , **Kapvay** , **Nexiclon** , **Clophelin** , and others) is a [depressant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressant) substance of the [arylaminoimidazoline](/w/index.php?title=Arylaminoimidazoline&action=edit&redlink=1) class. It is primarily used to treat [high blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure) , but can also be used for a variety of conditions that include attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) disorders, tic disorders, [substance withdrawal](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drug_withdrawal) , migraine, [diarrhea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Diarrhea) , and certain pain conditions.

Developed by Boehringer Ingelheim for its blood pressure effects, clonidine first saw clinical use in 1966. As the first anti-hypertensive agent with a clearly identifiable central site of action, clonidine has been an important pharmacological tool in discovering the role of central α-adrenoceptors in the physiology of central blood pressure regulation.

Clonidine is classified as a centrally acting α 2 [adrenergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Adrenergic) [agonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist) and imidazoline [receptor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Receptor) [agonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist) . Its activity on the α 2 receptors in the brainstem inhibits the release of [norepinephrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Norepinephrine) (NE), resulting in decreased sympathetic nervous system tone.

Clonidine has several off-label uses. It has been prescribed to treat psychiatric disorders including stress, sleep disorders, and hyperarousal caused by post-traumatic stress disorder, borderline personality disorder, and other anxiety disorders.

## History and culture

In the early 1960s, the medicinal chemist Helmut Stähle was tasked by Boehringer Ingelheim with synthesizing a peripherally active a-adrenergic compound that would be useful for nasal decongestion as simple nose drops. A locally acting a-adrenergic vasoconstrictor agent was expected to provide relief from the symptoms of the common cold by shrinking the swollen nasal membranes and producing an unobstructed air passage.

The synthetic design of clonidine was achieved when Stähle had the idea of substituting two chlorine groups on the phenyl group of the imidazoline structure, which most of the newer decongestive agents at the time were derived from. At that time, a double halogen substitution was still unusual for pharmaceuticals, and the prevailing opinion was that compounds with several halogen atoms would at best be useful as pesticides. Despite this, clonidine was pursued and discovered to have a remarkably high vasoconstrictive and decongestive effect at an unusually low dosage level.

The decongestive effects were then determined by nasal cavity tests on anesthetized dogs. After the first trial in humans, it became clear that clonidine's decongestant properties were far less interesting than its potent anti-hypertensive effects. The compound was then developed for this new indication and was introduced into therapy in 1966 under the trade name **Catapres** , where it saw widespread use.

With the discovery of clonidine, the central a-adrenergic receptors first became known to chemists, pharmacologists and physicians. It has been an important pharmacological tool in researching the role of central α-adrenoceptors in the physiology of central blood pressure regulation and nervous system function.

In the 2010s, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved clonidine, both alone or with [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) , for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in pediatric and adult patients. In Australia, clonidine is an accepted but not approved use for ADHD by the TGA.

## Chemistry

Clonidine, or 2-[(2,6-Dichlorophenyl)imino]imidazoline, is a compound of the imidazoline chemical class. Imidazolines are substituted amidines in which the amidine function is incorporated into an imidazoline ring. This portion is connected to an aromatic nucleus by way of a methylene bridge.

Additionally, two chlorine atoms are substituted in the 2- and 6-positions of the phenyl ring. This addition has the critical effect of making the molecule sufficiently lipophilic to penetrate the blood-brain barrier. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

Other compounds of this class include the a-adrenergic agents tolazoline, naphazoline, and phentolamine. The a-adrenergic effects of clonidine and other imidazolidine compounds may be explained on the basis of a structural overlap between clonidine and [norepinephrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Norepinephrine) .

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

Clonidine is an [agonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist) for the α 2 [adrenergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Adrenaline) [receptor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Receptor) . When α 2 receptors in the brain are stimulated, peripheral vascular resistance decreases, resulting in lowered blood pressure. It has specificity towards the presynaptic α 2 receptors in the vasomotor center in the brainstem. This binding decreases presynaptic calcium levels and inhibits the release of [norepinephrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Norepinephrine) (NE). The net effect is a decrease in sympathetic nervous system tone.

Three G-protein coupled α2-receptor subtypes have been identified: α 2A , α 2B , and α 2C . Each subtype has a unique pattern of tissue distribution in the central nervous system and peripheral tissues. The α2A-receptor is widely distributed throughout the central nervous system; it is found in the locus coeruleus, brain stem nuclei, cerebral cortex, septum, hypothalamus, and hippocampus. α 2A receptors are also expressed in the kidneys, spleen, thymus, lung and salivary glands. The α 2C -receptor is primarily expressed in the central nervous system, including the striatum, olfactory tubercle, hippocampus and cerebral cortex. The α 2B receptor is located primarily in the periphery (kidney, liver, lung and heart). [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

The α 2A - and α 2C receptors are located presynaptically and inhibit the released of noradrenaline from sympathetic nerves. Stimulation of these receptors decreases sympathetic tone, resulting in decreases in blood pressure and heart rate. Sedation and analgesia is mediated by centrally located α 2A receptors, while peripheral α 2B receptors mediate constriction of vascular smooth muscle. α 2A receptors also mediate essential components of the analgesic effect of nitrous oxide in the spinal cord. Clonidine stimulates all three α 2 receptor subtypes with similar potency. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

Clonidine also has peripheral α 1 agonist activity. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

Clonidine is also an agonist for the imidazoline I 1 receptor. This has been proposed to be responsible for the antihypertensive effects.

### Pharmacokinetics

Clonidine is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and has excellent CNS penetration because of lipid solubility. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] Peak plasma concentrations are reached 3-5 hours after a single oral dose. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] No known pharmacologically active metabolites exist. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] Plasma half-life is 12-16 hours, with the antihypertensive effects occurring within 30-60 minutes of ingestion. Clonidine is excreted unchanged in the urine and is metabolized by the liver. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

## Subjective effects

'' ***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.''*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation)** - Clonidine can produce a strong sedative effect, which has been compared to that of [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) . Users can become very tired and sleep through prompts to awake.
- **[Decreased heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Decreased_heart_rate)** - In normal use as well as overdose, heartrate is lowered and is directly affected by how much is taken.
- **[Decreased blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Decreased_blood_pressure)** - Clonidine's sympatholytic effects quickly and effectively lower blood pressure. Users should take care to avoid standing up too quickly to avoid an overwhelming light-headedness and possible fainting spell.
- **[Abnormal heartbeat](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Abnormal_heartbeat)** - This effect has a low likelihood. Caution should be taken if clonidine is taken with other substances that affect heartbeat. Intense physical activity should be avoided while on this substance.
- **[Dry mouth](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dry_mouth)**
- **[Constipation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Constipation)**
- **[Physical fatigue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_fatigue)**
- **[Pupil constriction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pupil_constriction)**
- **[Dizziness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dizziness)** - This effect can increase the likelihood of falling and injuring oneself.
- **Raynaud's Phenomenon** - Raynaud's Phenomenon occurs when the spasm of arteries results in reduced blood flow to the extremities, causing a pale tone, tingling, coldness, and numbness. ### Cognitive effects
 
- - **[Cognitive fatigue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_fatigue)**
- **[Addiction suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Addiction_suppression)** - Clonidine has shown efficacy as a treatment for alcohol, opioid, and nicotine substance use disorders. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] It has been shown to block opiate withdrawal symptoms.
- **[Anxiety suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety_suppression)** - Clonidine has mild to moderate anxiolytic effects and is sometimes used clinically to treat anxiety.
- **[Focus enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Focus_enhancement)** - This effect usually occurs at lower doses which are sometimes prescribed for the treatment of ADHD.
- **[Focus suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Focus_suppression)** - This effect usually occurs at higher doses.
- **[Memory enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Memory_enhancement)**
- **[Thought deceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_deceleration)** ### Auditory effects
 
- - **[Auditory suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_suppression)** - Reports describe this effect as a "hollow" loss of hearing. It is believed to be a result of lowered blood pressure. ### After effects
 
- - **[Irritability](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Irritability)** - One can feel very agitated and annoyed, especially with more ease. This especially happens when the medicine is suddenly stopped, which is an incorrect practice; clonidine should be [tapered](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tapering) off of the user.
- **[Increased heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate)** - This occurs as a rebound effect to clonidine's antihypertensive effects and is typically only prominent following sustained use.
- **[Increased blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure)** - This occurs as a rebound effect to clonidine's antihypertensive effects and is typically only prominent following sustained use.

## Toxicity and harm potential

At therapeutic doses (0.2-0.9 mg/d), clonidine is commonly associated with adverse effects such as dry mouth, sedation, dizziness, and constipation. While generally safe, at toxic doses clonidine can cause serious cardiopulmonary instability and central nervous system (CNS) depression in children and adults. Caution should be used when clonidine is taken with other [depressants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressants) .

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_use) when using this substance.

### Lethal dosage

The oral [LD50](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LD50) for clonidine in mice is 206 mg/kg and for rats, 465 mg/kg. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] In humans, lethality is rare with a small number of reported deaths. Morbidity, in terms of cardiorespiratory and CNS dysfunction, generally tends to be more severe in young persons than in adults. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

### Overdose

Symptoms of clonidine overdose include constriction of pupils of the eye, drowsiness, high blood pressure followed by a drop in pressure, irritability, low body temperature, slowed breathing, slowed heartbeat, slowed reflexes, and weakness. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

There are case reports that show [naloxone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Naloxone) may be a useful antidote in treating clonidine overdoses. However, this is not in widespread clinical use.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

Clonidine is not addictive and has a low potential for abuse. The chronic use of clonidine can produce physical dependence and withdrawal symptoms if one suddenly stops their usage. Clonidine therapy should generally be gradually tapered when discontinuing therapy to avoid rebound hypertension from occurring.

Although clonidine is not considered to be addictive, cases of misuse have been documented among certain groups with pre-existing substance use disorders. It is sometimes used in combination with [opiates](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opiates) to extend and potentiate their effects. This practice may increase the risk of oversedation and respiratory depression associated with opioid use.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **Depressants** ( *[1,4-Butanediol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/1,4-Butanediol) , [2M2B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2M2B) , [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) , [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) , [barbiturates](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Barbiturates) , [GHB](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GHB) / [GBL](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GBL) , [methaqualone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methaqualone) , [opioids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioids)* ) - This combination potentiates the [muscle relaxation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_relaxation) , [amnesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amnesia) , [sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation) , and [respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression) caused by one another. At higher doses, it can lead to a sudden, unexpected loss of consciousness along with a dangerous amount of depressed respiration. There is also an increased risk of suffocating on one's vomit while unconscious. If [nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea) or vomiting occurs before a loss of consciousness, users should attempt to fall asleep in the [recovery position](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Recovery_position) or have a friend move them into it.
- **Dissociatives** - This combination can unpredictably potentiate the [amnesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amnesia) , [sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation) , [motor control loss](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motor_control_loss) and [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) that can be caused by each other. It may also result in a sudden loss of consciousness accompanied by a dangerous degree of [respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression) . If [nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea) or vomiting occurs before consciousness is lost, users should attempt to fall asleep in the [recovery position](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Recovery_position) or have a friend move them into it.
- **Stimulants** - Stimulants mask the [sedative](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation) effect of depressants, which is the main factor most people use to gauge their level of intoxication. Once the stimulant effects wear off, the effects of the depressant will significantly increase, leading to intensified [disinhibition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Disinhibition) , [motor control loss](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motor_control_loss) , and dangerous [black-out states](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amnesia) . This combination can also potentially result in severe dehydration if one's fluid intake is not closely monitored. If choosing to combine these substances, one should strictly limit themselves to a pre-set schedule of dosing only a certain amount per hour until a maximum threshold has been reached.

  "wikipedia": `# Clonidine
*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clonidine*

Clonidine, sold under the brand name Catapres among others, is an α2-adrenergic receptor agonist,  hypotensive and anxiolytic agent used to treat high blood pressure, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, perioperative pain, drug withdrawal (e.g., alcohol, opioids, or nicotine), and menopausal flushing. The drug is often prescribed off-label for tics. It is used orally (by mouth), by injection, or as a transdermal skin patch. Onset of action is typically within an hour with the effects on blood pressure lasting for up to eight hours. Xylazine is a structural analog of clonidine.
Common side effects include dry mouth, dizziness, headaches, hypotension, and sleepiness. Severe side effects may include hallucinations, heart arrhythmias, and confusion. If rapidly stopped, withdrawal effects may occur, such as a dangerous rise in blood pressure. Use during pregnancy or breastfeeding is not recommended. Clonidine lowers blood pressure by stimulating α2-adrenergic receptors and imidazoline receptors in the brain, which results in relaxation of many arteries.
Clonidine was patented in 1961 and came into medical use in 1966. It is available as a generic medication. In 2023, it was the 82nd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 8 million prescriptions.

## Medical uses

Clonidine is used to treat high blood pressure, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD); drug withdrawal, including from (alcohol, opioids, and/or nicotine); menopausal flushing, diarrhea, and certain pain conditions. In addition, it also sees some use off-label for episodic insomnia, and tics (e.g. from Tourette syndrome, restless legs syndrome, and anxiety, among others).

### Resistant hypertension

Clonidine may be effective for lowering blood pressure in people with resistant hypertension.
Clonidine works by slowing the pulse rate and exerts a reduction of serum concentrations of renin, aldosterone, and catecholamines.

### Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder

Clonidine may improve symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in some people but causes many adverse effects and the beneficial effect is modest. In Australia, clonidine is an accepted but not approved use for ADHD by the Therapeutic Goods Administration. Clonidine, along with methylphenidate, has been studied for treatment of ADHD. While not as effective as methylphenidate in treating ADHD, clonidine does offer some benefit; it can also be useful in combination with stimulant medications. Some studies show clonidine to be more sedating than guanfacine, which may be better at bedtime along with an arousing stimulant in the morning. Clonidine has been used to reduce sleep disturbances in ADHD, including to help offset stimulant-associated insomnia. Unlike stimulant medications, clonidine is regarded as having no abuse potential, and may even be used to reduce abuse of drugs including nicotine and cocaine.
In the US, only the extended-release form of clonidine is approved for ADHD treatment.

### Borderline personality disorder

Clonidine has been studied off-label in borderline personality disorder (BPD) to address specific acute symptoms such as hyperarousal, inner tension, dissociation, self-injurious urges, and sleep disturbances.
A systematic review of psychopharmacology in BPD identified clonidine as a promising adjunctive therapy targeting noradrenergic dysregulation, especially in comorbid PTSD cases. However, it emphasized the limitations of small sample sizes and called for larger placebo-controlled trials.
Clinicians often employ clonidine when BPD patients present with acute emotional dysregulation, intrusive dissociation, or insomnia. Clinical anecdotal reports and patient experiences have also highlighted its practical utility.

### Drug withdrawal

Clonidine may be used to ease drug withdrawal symptoms associated with abruptly stopping the long-term use of opioids, alcohol, benzodiazepines, and nicotine. It can alleviate opioid withdrawal symptoms by reducing the sympathetic nervous system response such as tachycardia and hypertension, hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating), hot and cold flashes, and akathisia. It may also be helpful in aiding smokers to quit. The sedation effect can also be useful. Clonidine may also reduce severity of neonatal abstinence syndrome in infants born to mothers that are using certain drugs, particularly opioids. In infants with neonatal withdrawal syndrome, clonidine may improve the neonatal intensive care unit Network Neurobehavioral Score.
Clonidine has also been suggested as a treatment for rare instances of dexmedetomidine withdrawal.

### Spasticity

Clonidine has some role in the treatment of spasticity caused by spinal cord injury, acting principally by inhibiting excessive sensory transmissionbelow the level of injury. Its use, however, is mainly as a second or third line agent, due to side effects such as hypotension, bradycardia, and drowsiness. Clonidine can be administered intrathecally, which confers various benefits, including a reduction or prevention of the blood pressure lowering effects and increased effectiveness against spasticity. The effectiveness of intrathecal clonidine is comparable to that of intrathecal baclofen for spasticity.

### Clonidine suppression test

The reduction in circulating norepinephrine by clonidine was used in the past as an investigatory test for phaeochromocytoma, which is a catecholamine-synthesizing tumor, usually found in the adrenal medulla. In a clonidine suppression test, plasma catecholamine levels are measured before and 3 hours after a 0.3 mg oral test dose has been given to the patient. A positive test occurs if there is no decrease in plasma levels.

### Other uses

Clonidine also has several off-label uses, and has been prescribed to treat psychiatric disorders including stress, hyperarousal caused by post-traumatic stress disorder, borderline personality disorder, and other anxiety disorders. Clonidine is also a mild sedative, and can be used as premedication before surgery or procedures. It has also been studied as a way to calm acute manic episodes. Its epidural use for pain during heart attack, and postoperative and intractable pain has also been studied extensively. Clonidine can be used in restless legs syndrome. It can also be used to treat facial flushing and redness associated with rosacea. It has also been successfully used topically in a clinical trial as a treatment for diabetic neuropathy. Clonidine can also be used for migraine headaches and hot flashes associated with menopause. Clonidine has also been used to treat refractory diarrhea associated with irritable bowel syndrome, fecal incontinence, diabetes, diarrhea associated with opioid withdrawal, intestinal failure, neuroendocrine tumors, and cholera. Clonidine can be used in the treatment of Tourette syndrome (specifically for tics). Clonidine has also had some success in clinical trials for helping to remove or ameliorate the symptoms of hallucinogen persisting perception disorder (HPPD).
Injection of α2-adrenergic receptor agonists into the knee joint space, including clonidine, may reduce the severity of knee pain after arthroscopic knee surgery.
Light-activated derivatives of clonidine (adrenoswitches) have been developed for research purposes and shown to control pupillary reflex with light in blind mice by topical application.

### Pregnancy and breastfeeding

It is classified by the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration as pregnancy category B3, which means that it has shown some detrimental effects on fetal development in animal studies, although the relevance of this to human beings is unknown. Clonidine appears in high concentration in breast milk; a nursing infant's serum clonidine concentration is approximately 2/3 of the mother's. Caution is warranted in women who are pregnant, planning to become pregnant, or are breastfeeding.

## Adverse effects

The principal adverse effects of clonidine are sedation, dry mouth, and hypotension (low blood pressure).

## Pharmacology

### Mechanism of action

Clonidine crosses the blood–brain barrier.

#### High blood pressure

Clonidine treats high blood pressure by stimulating α2 receptors in the brainstem, which decreases peripheral vascular resistance, lowering blood pressure. It has specificity towards the presynaptic α2 receptors in the vasomotor center in the brainstem. This binding has a sympatholytic effect, suppresses release of norepinephrine, ATP, renin, and neuropeptide Y which if released would increase vascular resistance.
Clonidine also acts as an agonist at imidazoline-1 (I1) receptors in the brain, and it is hypothesized that this effect may contribute to reducing blood pressure by reducing signaling in the sympathetic nervous system; this effect acts upstream of the central α2 agonist effect of clonidine.
Clonidine may also cause bradycardia, theoretically by increasing signaling through the vagus nerve. When given intravenously, clonidine can temporarily increase blood pressure by stimulating α1 receptors in smooth muscles in blood vessels. This hypertensive effect is not usual when clonidine is given orally or by the transdermal route.
Plasma concentration of clonidine exceeding 2.0 ng/mL does not provide further blood pressure reduction.

#### Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder

In the setting of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), clonidine's molecular mechanism of action occurs due to its agonism at the α2A adrenergic receptor, the subtype of the adrenergic receptor that is most principally found in the brain. Within the brain, the α2A adrenergic receptors are found within the prefrontal cortex (PFC), among other areas. The α2A adrenergic receptors are found on the presynaptic cleft of a given neuron, and, when activated by an agonist, the effect on downstream neurons is inhibitory. The inhibition is accomplished by preventing the secretion of the neurotransmitter norepinephrine. Thus, clonidine's agonism on α2A adrenergic receptors in the PFC inhibits the action of downstream neurons by preventing the secretion of norepinephrine.
This mechanism is similar to the brain's physiological inhibition of PFC neurons by the locus ceruleus (LC), which secretes norepinephrine into the PFC. Although norepinephrine can also bind to target adrenergic receptors on the downstream neuron (otherwise inducing a stimulatory effect), norepinephrine also binds to α2A adrenergic receptors (akin to clonidine's mechanism of action), inhibiting the release of norepinephrine by that neuron and inducing an inhibitory effect. Because the PFC is required for working memory and attention, it is thought that clonidine's inhibition of PFC neurons helps to eliminate irrelevant attention (and subsequent behaviors), improving the person's focus and correcting deficits in attention.

#### Growth hormone test

Clonidine stimulates release of GHRH hormone from the hypothalamus, which in turn stimulates pituitary release of growth hormone. This effect has been used as part of a "growth hormone test," which can assist with diagnosing growth hormone deficiency in children.

### Pharmacokinetics

After being ingested, clonidine is absorbed into the blood stream rapidly with an overall bioavailability around 70–80%. Peak concentrations in human plasma occur within 60–90 minutes for the "immediate release" (IR) version of the drug, which is shorter than the "extended release" (ER/XR) version. Clonidine is fairly lipid soluble with the logarithm of its partition coefficient (log P) equal to 1.6; to compare, the optimal log P to allow a drug that is active in the human central nervous system to penetrate the blood brain barrier is 2.0. Less than half of the absorbed portion of an orally administered dose will be metabolized by the liver into inactive metabolites, with roughly the other half being excreted unchanged by the kidneys. About one-fifth of an oral dose will not be absorbed, and is thus excreted in the feces. Work with liver microsomes shows in the liver clonidine is primarily metabolized by CYP2D6 (66%), CYP1A2 (10–20%), and CYP3A (0–20%) with negligible contributions from the less abundant enzymes CYP3A5, CYP1A1, and CYP3A4. 4-hydroxyclonidine, the main metabolite of clonidine, is also an α2A agonist but is non lipophilic and is not believed to contribute to the effects of clonidine since it does not cross the blood–brain barrier.
Measurements of the half-life of clonidine vary widely, between 6 and 23 hours, with the half-life being greatly affected by and prolonged in the setting of poor kidney function. Variations in half-life may be partially attributable to CYP2D6 genetics. Some research has suggested the half-life of clonidine is dose dependent and approximately doubles upon chronic dosing, while other work contradicts this. Following a 0.3 mg oral dose, a small study of five patients by Dollery et al. (1976) found half-lives ranging between 6.3 and 23.4 hours (mean 12.7). A similar N=5 study by Davies et al. (1977) found a narrower range of half-lives, between 6.7 and 13 hours (mean 8.6), while an N=8 study by Keraäen et al. that included younger patients found a somewhat shorter mean half-life of 7.5 hours.
