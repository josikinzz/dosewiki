2,5-Dimethoxy-4-propylamphetamine (DOPR) is a psychedelic drug of the phenethylamine, amphetamine, and DOx families related to DOM. It is the derivative of DOM in which the methyl group at the 4 position has been replaced with a propyl group. The drug is taken orally.
The drug acts as a serotonin receptor agonist, including of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor. It produces psychedelic-like effects in animals.
DOPR was first described in the literature by Alexander Shulgin in 1970. Subsequently, it was described in greater detail by Shulgin in his 1991 book PiHKAL (Phenethylamines I Have Known and Loved).

## Use and effects

In his book PiHKAL (Phenethylamines I Have Known and Loved), Alexander Shulgin lists DOPR's dose as 2.5 to 5 mg orally and its duration as 20 to 30 hours. It is said to have a very slow onset. The effects of DOPR have been reported to include closed-eye imagery, visuals, thinking changes, and insomnia and sleep disruption, among others. In one of the reports, it was described as a "heavy duty psychedelic", including strong and unignorable visuals.

## Interactions

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

DOPR acts as an agonist of the serotonin 5-HT2 receptors, including of the serotonin 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, and 5-HT2C receptors. It has very weak affinity for the serotonin 5-HT1 receptor. The drug has also been assessed at other receptors.
It produces the head-twitch response (HTR), a behavioral proxy of psychedelic effects, in rodents. It is slightly more potent but slightly less efficacious than DOM in producing the head-twitch response. As with many other psychedelics, DOPR shows an inverted U-shaped dose–response curve in terms of the HTR, increasing it at lower doses and having diminished effectiveness at higher doses.
DOPR showed no significant effects on locomotor activity in rodents at the assessed doses, but showed a trend towards hyperlocomotion at the highest dose. In a subsequent study however, it produced hyperlocomotion at lower doses and hypolocomotion at higher doses. The drug has shown pro-motivational effects in rodents at sub-hallucinogenic doses or so-called "microdoses". DOPR's close analogue DOET has also been clinically studied at sub-hallucinogenic doses as a "psychic energizer".
At higher doses, DOPR produces hypothermia in rodents.

### Pharmacokinetics

DOPR crosses the blood–brain barrier in rodents. The drug showed the highest brain/plasma ratio among DOM homologues in rodents, whereas 2,5-dimethoxyamphetamine (2,5-DMA) showed the lowest. This was involved in potency differences between the drugs.

## Chemistry

### Synthesis

The chemical synthesis of DOPR has been described.

### Analogues

The alternative structural isomer DOIP, with a 4-isopropyl substitution, is also known but is around ten times weaker than DOPR, with an active dose of some 20–30 mg (as compared to 2–5 mg for DOPR).

## History

DOPR was first described in the literature by Alexander Shulgin in 1970. Subsequently, it was described in greater detail by Shulgin in his 1991 book PiHKAL (Phenethylamines I Have Known and Loved).
