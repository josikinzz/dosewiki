# Dextropropoxyphene
*Source: https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB00647*

## Overview

### Description

This compound belongs to the class of organic compounds known as stilbenes. These are organic compounds containing a 1,2-diphenylethylene moiety. Stilbenes (C6-C2-C6 ) are derived from the common phenylpropene (C6-C3) skeleton building block. The introduction of one or more hydroxyl groups  to a phenyl ring lead to stilbenoids.

### Background

Dextropropoxyphene is an opioid analgesic manufactured by Eli Lilly and Company. It is used in the symptomatic treatment of mild pain. It displays antitussive and local anaesthetic actions. Due to the risk of cardiac arrhythmias and overdose, possibly leading to death, dextropropoxyphene has been withdrawn from the market in Europe and the United States. The drug is often referred to as the general form, "propoxyphene", however only the dextro-isomer (dextropropoxyphene) has any analgesic effect. The levo-isomer appears to exhibit a very limited antitussive effect.

### Indication

For the relief of mild to moderate pain.

### Pharmacodynamics

Propoxyphene, a synthetic opiate agonist, is structurally similar to methadone. Its general pharmacologic properties are those of the opiates as a group. The analgesic effect of propoxyphene is due to the d-isomer, dextropropoxyphene. It binds to the opiate receptors and leads to a decrease of the perception of pain stimuli. Propoxyphene possesses little to no antitussive activity and no antipyretic action.

### Mechanism of Action

Mu-type opioid receptor
Agonist
Delta-type opioid receptor
Agonist
Kappa-type opioid receptor
Antagonist

### Metabolism

Hepatic

### Half-life

6-12 hours

### Toxicity

Coma, respiratory depression, circulatory collapse, and pulmonary edema. Seizures occur more frequently in patients with propoxyphene intoxication than in those with opiate intoxication. LD

### Mechanism of action

Propoxyphene acts as a weak agonist at OP1, OP2, and OP3 opiate receptors within the central nervous system (CNS). Propoxyphene primarily affects OP3 receptors, which are coupled with G-protein receptors and function as modulators, both positive and negative, of synaptic transmission via G-proteins that activate effector proteins. Binding of the opiate stimulates the exchange of GTP for GDP on the G-protein complex. As the effector system is adenylate cyclase and cAMP located at the inner surface of the plasma membrane, opioids decrease intracellular cAMP by inhibiting adenylate cyclase. Subsequently, the release of nociceptive neurotransmitters such as substance P, GABA, dopamine, acetylcholine, and noradrenaline is inhibited. Opioids such as propoxyphene also inhibit the release of vasopressin, somatostatin, insulin, and glucagon. Opioids close N-type voltage-operated calcium channels (OP2-receptor agonist) and open calcium-dependent inwardly rectifying potassium channels (OP3 and OP1 receptor agonist). This results in hyperpolarization and reduced neuronal excitability.

### Volume of distribution

16 L/kg

### Route of elimination

The major route of metabolism is cytochrome CYP3A4 mediated N-demethylation to norpropoxyphene, which is excreted by the kidneys. 
In 48 hours, approximately 20% to 25% of the administered dose of propoxyphene is excreted via the urine, most of which is free or conjugated norpropoxyphene.

### General Function

Involved in the detoxification of xenobiotics and in the activation of ester and amide prodrugs (PubMed:18762277, PubMed:7980644, PubMed:9169443, PubMed:9490062). Hydrolyzes aromatic and aliphatic esters, but has no catalytic activity toward amides or a fatty acyl-CoA ester (PubMed:18762277, PubMed:7980644, PubMed:9169443, PubMed:9490062). Hydrolyzes the methyl ester group of cocaine to form benzoylecgonine (PubMed:7980644). Catalyzes the transesterification of cocaine to form cocaethylene (PubMed:7980644). Displays fatty acid ethyl ester synthase activity, catalyzing the ethyl esterification of oleic acid to ethyloleate (PubMed:7980644). Converts monoacylglycerides to free fatty acids and glycerol. Hydrolyzes of 2-arachidonoylglycerol and prostaglandins (PubMed:21049984). Hydrolyzes cellular cholesteryl esters to free cholesterols and promotes reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) by facilitating both the initial and final steps in the process (PubMed:11015575, PubMed:16024911, PubMed:16971496, PubMed:18762277). First of all, allows free cholesterol efflux from macrophages to extracellular cholesterol acceptors and secondly, releases free cholesterol from lipoprotein-delivered cholesteryl esters in the liver for bile acid synthesis or direct secretion into the bile (PubMed:16971496, PubMed:18599737, PubMed:18762277)
