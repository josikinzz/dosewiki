**N-Ethyl-nor-pentedrone** (also known as **N-Ethylpentedrone** , **Ethyl-pentedrone** or more commonly, **NEP** ) is a lesser-known novel [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) substance of the [cathinone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cathinone) class that produces [stimulating](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulating) , [euphoric](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Euphoric) , and mildly [entactogenic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entactogenic) effects when [administered](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Routes_of_administration) .

The stimulating effects of NEP are believed to mainly be caused by its activity as a [norepinephrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Norepinephrine) - [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) [reuptake inhibitor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Reuptake_inhibitor) (NDRI). The reported entactogenic effects it displays may also be due to its activity as a [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) [reuptake inhibitor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Reuptake_inhibitor) or [releasing agent](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Releasing_agent) in moderate to high doses, although new research has shown very low serotonin reuptake inhibition. NEP probably acts as unselective [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) - [norepinephrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Norepinephrine) - [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) [reuptake inhibitor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Reuptake_inhibitor) (SNDRI).

NEP shares a close structural relationship to its parent compound [pentedrone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pentedrone) , differing by an addition ethyl group on the terminal nitrogen on the carbon chain. This addition reportedly makes it about three times as potent as pentedrone. NEP is also closely related to [N-Ethylhexedrone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/N-Ethylhexedrone) (commonly known as *Hexen* ), and has been reported as producing largely-similar effects.

NEP first became known in the [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) market during 2016. It is an example of a contemporary [designer drug](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Designer_drug) specifically chosen to mimic/replace the functional and structural features of its popular potent and short-lived-type stimulant predecessors, which are sometimes imprecisely referred to as "bath salts".

As with its parent compound [pentedrone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pentedrone) , very little data exists about the pharmacological properties, metabolism, and toxicity of NEP in humans. Due to its novelty and extremely short history of human usage, all information related to the use of this compound should be treated with extreme caution. It is highly advised that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) if choosing to use this substance.

## Chemistry

NEP, or N-Ethyl-(nor)-pentedrone, belongs to the [cathinone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Substituted_cathinone) chemical class. It features a [phenethylamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamine) core with an alkyl group attached to the alpha carbon and an oxygen group attached to the beta carbon. Cathinones are beta-ketone analogues of [amphetamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) . Cathinones refer to a class of molecules which are principally constituted of a [phenethylamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamine) core with an alkyl group attached to the alpha carbon and an oxygen group attached to the beta carbon. They are also known as the beta-ketone (double-bonded oxygen to the β-carbon) analogs of [amphetamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) . The cathinone backbone can be modified in three different places to create hundreds of possible compounds, which include substituents on the aromatic ring, the alpha carbon, and the amine group.

## Pharmacology

Due to the lack of research regarding the substance, a lot of the discussion regarding the pharmacology of it is purely based upon its structure and subjective effect similarities to other [cathinones](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Substituted_cathinone) such as [mephedrone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mephedrone) and others. However, a recent study has shown that NEP acts as a potent [serotonin-norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Reuptake_inhibitor) (SNDRI) with very poor affinity for [SERT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) . This allows dopamine, serotonin and norepinephrine to accumulate within the brain, resulting in [stimulating](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation) and [euphoric](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria) effects. That being said, an interaction with other receptor sites cannot yet be fully ruled out.

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)** - In terms of its effects on the user's physical energy levels, NEP can be considered to be extremely stimulating and energetic.
- **[Spontaneous tactile sensations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_tactile_sensations)** - High doses of NEP result in a pleasurable body high characterized by pleasant tingling.
- **[Tactile enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_enhancement)**
- **[Dehydration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dehydration)** - Dry mouth and increased sweating can occur after consuming NEP. Low doses of the substance in question cause minimal dehydration.
- **[Vasoconstriction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction)** - NEP has been reported as being slightly vasoconstricting.
- **[Abnormal heartbeat](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Abnormal_heartbeat)**
- **[Increased blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure)**
- **[Increased heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate)** - NEP increases heart rate significantly compared to other stimulants, even at low doses.
- **[Increased perspiration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_perspiration)**
- **[Appetite suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Appetite_suppression)**
- **[Temporary erectile dysfunction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Temporary_erectile_dysfunction)**
- **[Teeth grinding](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Teeth_grinding)** - This component can be considered to be less intense when compared with that of [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) . ### Cognitive effects
 
- - **[Cognitive euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_euphoria)**
- **[Thought acceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_acceleration)**
- **[Analysis enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Analysis_enhancement)** - This effect is mostly present in lower doses when not overshadowed by euphoria.
- **[Empathy, affection, and sociability enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Empathy,_affection,_and_sociability_enhancement)** - These feelings of sociability, love and empathy are much weaker and less sharp than those found on substances such as [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) but seem to be present at high doses for some users. The presence of this effect has lead many users to speculate that this compound likely functions as a [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) [reuptake inhibitor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Reuptake_inhibitor) as well as a [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) and [noradrenaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Noradrenaline) reuptake inhibitor.
- **[Immersion enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Immersion_enhancement)**
- **[Focus enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Focus_enhancement)**
- **[Ego inflation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ego_inflation)**
- **[Disinhibition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Disinhibition)**
- **[Increased libido](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_libido)**
- **[Increased music appreciation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_music_appreciation)**
- **[Time distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Time_distortion)**
- **[Motivation enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motivation_enhancement)**
- **[Compulsive redosing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Compulsive_redosing)** ### After effects
 
- The effects which occur during the [offset](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Offset) of a [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) experience generally feel negative and uncomfortable in comparison to the effects which occurred during its [peak](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Peak) . This is often referred to as a "comedown" and occurs because of [neurotransmitter](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurotransmitter) depletion. Its effects commonly include: 
- **[Anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety)**
- **[Headaches](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Headaches)**
- **[Cognitive fatigue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_fatigue)**
- **[Depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depression)**
- **[Irritability](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Irritability)**
- **[Motivation suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motivation_suppression)**
- **[Thought deceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_deceleration)**
- **[Wakefulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness)**
 It should be noted that many users of this substance report it has relatively smooth ["come down"](/w/index.php?title=Durations&action=edit&redlink=1) compared to similar cathinone stimulants, so these effects may not be present to as great of a degree.
### Experience reports

There are currently no anecdotal reports which describe the effects of this compound within our [experience index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Experience_index) . Additional experience reports can be found here:

- [Erowid Experience Vaults: N-Ethylpentedrone](https://www.erowid.org/experiences/subs/exp_NEthylpentedrone.shtml)

## Toxicity and harm potential

The toxicity and long-term health effects of recreational NEP use do not seem to have been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dosage is unknown. This is because NEP has an extremely brief history of human usage. Early anecdotal evidence from people who have tried NEP within the community suggests that there do not seem to be any negative health effects attributed to simply trying this substance at low to moderate doses by itself and using it in a sparing and controlled fashion (but nothing can be completely guaranteed)

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this substance.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

As with other [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) , the chronic use of N-ethyl-(nor)-pentedrone can be considered moderately addictive with a high potential for abuse and is capable of causing psychological dependence among certain users. When addiction has developed, cravings and [withdrawal effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Withdrawal_effects) may occur if a person suddenly stops their usage.

Tolerance to many of the effects of NEP develops with prolonged and repeated use. This results in users having to administer increasingly large doses to achieve the same effects. After that, it takes about 3 - 7 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 1 - 2 weeks to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). NEP presents cross-tolerance with all [dopaminergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) , meaning that after the consumption of N-ethyl-(nor)-pentedrone all [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) will have a reduced effect.

### Psychosis

Abuse of compounds within the stimulant class at high dosages for prolonged periods of time can potentially result in a stimulant psychosis that may present with a variety of symptoms (e.g., [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/External_hallucinations) , or [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) ). A review on treatment for amphetamine, [dextroamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dextroamphetamine) , and [methamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) abuse-induced psychosis states that about 5–15% of users fail to recover completely. The same review asserts that, based upon at least one trial, [antipsychotic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antipsychotic) medications effectively resolve the symptoms of acute amphetamine psychosis.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **[Stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants)** - NEP can be potentially dangerous in combination with other [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) as it can [increase one's heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate) and [blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure) to dangerous levels.
- **[25x-NBOMe](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25x-NBOMe) & [25x-NBOH](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25x-NBOH)** - 25x compounds are highly stimulating and physically straining. Combinations with NEP should be strictly avoided due to the risk of excessive [stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation) and heart strain. This can result in [increased blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure) , [vasoconstriction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction) , panic attacks, [thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops) , [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) , and heart failure in extreme cases.
- **[Alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol)** - Combining alcohol with [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) can be dangerous due to the risk of accidental over-intoxication. Stimulants mask alcohol's [depressant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressant) effects, which is what most people use to assess their degree of intoxication. Once the stimulant wears off, the [depressant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressant) effects will be left unopposed, which can result in blackouts and severe [respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression) . If mixing, the user should strictly limit themselves to only drinking a certain amount of alcohol per hour.
- **[DXM](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DXM)** - Combinations with DXM should be avoided due to its inhibiting effects on [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) and [norepinephrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Norepinephrine) reuptake. There is an increased risk of [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) and hypertensive crisis, or [serotonin syndrome](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome) with serotonin releasers ( [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) , [methylone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylone) , [mephedrone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mephedrone) , etc.). Monitor blood pressure carefully and avoid strenuous physical activity.
- **[MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA)** - Any neurotoxic effects of MDMA are likely to be increased when other [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) are present. There is also a risk of excessive blood pressure and heart strain (cardiotoxicity).
- **[MXE](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MXE)** - Some reports suggest combinations with MXE may dangerously increase blood pressure and increase the risk of [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) .
- **[Dissociatives](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociatives)** - Both classes carry a risk of [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) , [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) , and these risk may be multiplied when combined.
- **[Stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants)** - NEP may be dangerous to combine with other [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) like [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) as they can [increase one's heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate) and [blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure) to dangerous levels.
- **[Tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol)** - Tramadol is known to lower the seizure threshold and combinations with stimulants may further increase this risk.
- **[MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA)** - The neurotoxic effects of MDMA may be increased when combined with [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) and other stimulants.

- **[MAOIs](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MAOIs)** - This combination may increase the amount of neurotransmitters such as dopamine to dangerous or even fatal levels. Examples include [syrian rue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Syrian_rue) , [banisteriopsis caapi](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Banisteriopsis_caapi) , and some [antidepressants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antidepressants) .
- **[Cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine)** - This combination may increase strain on the heart to dangerous, potentially fatal levels.

#### Serotonin syndrome risk

Combinations with the following substances can cause dangerously high [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) levels. [Serotonin syndrome](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome) requires immediate medical attention and can be fatal if left untreated.

- **MAOIs** - Such as [banisteriopsis caapi](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Banisteriopsis_caapi) , [syrian rue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Syrian_rue) , phenelzine, selegiline, and moclobemide.
- **Serotonin releasers** - Such as [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) , [4-FA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-FA) , [methamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) , [methylone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylone) and [αMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/%CE%91MT) .
- **SSRIs** - Such as citalopram and sertraline
- **[SNRIs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SNRIs)** - Such as [tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol) and venlafaxine
- **5-HTP**
