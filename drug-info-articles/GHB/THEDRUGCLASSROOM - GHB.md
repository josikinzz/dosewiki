# GHB
*Source: https://thedrugclassroom.com/video/ghb/*

GHB is a depressant which can be found naturally in the human body. It is used in recreational settings for its disinhibiting, libido-enhancing, pro-social, and sedative effects. The drug has also been used medically in people with narcolepsy and it was once widely used by bodybuilders for its positive effects on growth hormone levels.

Dose greatly affects the substance’s effects, with experiences ranging from moderate relaxation and greater sociability to overwhelming sedation and unconsciousness.

When common amounts are used, the drug isn’t particularly dangerous for healthy people acutely. Issues can arise with combinations (particularly with other depressants), high doses, and heavy frequent use.
