**5-Methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine** (also known as **5-MeO-DMT** ) is a [naturally-occurring](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Naturally-occurring) [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) substance of the [tryptamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tryptamine) class. It is structurally related to [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT) and [5-HO-DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/5-HO-DMT) ( *bufotenin* ) and is reputed to produce the most powerful and intense psychedelic states within the entire class. 5-MeO-DMT produces its effects by binding to [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) [receptors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Receptors) in the brain, although the precise mechanism is not known.

It is distributed in a wide variety of plant species as well as in the venom of a single toad species ( *Incilius alvarius* ). [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] Although little is known about its history, it is believed to have been used in South American shamanic practices for centuries. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] In modern times, both the extracts of the toad venom as well as synthetic powder form are used, primarily via [vaporization](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vaporization) .

The synthesis and psychoactive effects were documented by [Alexander Shulgin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alexander_Shulgin) in his 1997 book [TiHKAL](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/TiHKAL) ("Tryptamines I Have Known and Loved"). Recent studies have demonstrated its capacity to induce mystical experiences and there is growing interest in exploring its potential therapeutic effects. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

[Subjective effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effects) include [unity and interconnectedness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Unity_and_interconnectedness) , [time distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Time_distortion) , [conceptual thinking](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Conceptual_thinking) , [euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Euphoria) , and [ego loss](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ego_loss) . 5-MeO-DMT's psychedelic effects are best compared to [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT) in terms of intensity (extreme) and duration (very short). However, it generally lacks a [visual geometry](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Geometry) component and tends to produce more [physical euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria) as well as even stronger [transpersonal](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Transpersonal) or mystical-like effects (e.g. [ego loss](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ego_loss) ) than DMT.

Additionally, both mental and physical side effects are reported to occur more often with 5-MeO-DMT. These effects include significant [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) and [dysphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_dysphoria) as well as [nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea) and [bodily discomfort](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Body_load) , and are often described as challenging and overwhelming.

Unlike DMT, which has been shown to possess minimal physiological toxicity, 5-MeO-DMT's safety profile is much less established. A small number of deaths have been linked to its use and appear to be a result of physical overdose. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] Some reports suggest it may cause serotonin toxicity when combined with certain substances such as [MAOIs](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MAOIs) ; it may also have cardiotoxic properties. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

Anecdotal reports suggest that this substance is only suitable for users with extensive experience with powerful psychedelics (e.g. [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT) , [ayahuasca](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ayahuasca) , and [DPT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DPT) ) and trained in their safe use. It is highly advised to use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Harm_reduction_practices) if using this substance.

## Chemistry

5-MeO-DMT or 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine is a ring-substituted indole [alkaloid](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alkaloid) molecule of the [tryptamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tryptamine) class. Tryptamines share a core structure comprised of a bicylic indole heterocycle attached at R 3 to a terminal amine group via an ethyl side chain. 5-MeO-DMT is substituted at R 5 of its indole heterocycle with a methoxy (MeO) functional group CH 3 O−; it also contains two methyl groups CH 3 - bound to the terminal amine R N of its tryptamine backbone (DMT).

5-MeO-DMT is the N-substituted methyl homologue of [5-MeO-MiPT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/5-MeO-MiPT) and [5-MeO-DiPT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/5-MeO-DiPT) , although it radically differs in its effects.

### Endogenous presence

5-MeO-DMT has also been shown to be produced endogenously in the human body in trace amounts, although its biological function, if any, is unclear.

## Pharmacology

5-Meo-DMT's [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) effects are primarily believed to come from its efficacy at the [5-HT1A receptor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin#The_5-HT_system) as a [partial agonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist#Agonists) . Specifically, this molecule shows a high binding affinity for the 5-HT 1A subtype and relatively low binding for the 5-HT 2a subtype. Since common psychedelics are thought to primarily elicit their effects through 5-HT 2a receptor activity, the drug’s binding profile and how it results in the [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) experience continues to remain elusive.

Additional mechanisms of action such as [reuptake inhibition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Reuptake_inhibition) of [neurotransmitters](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurotransmitters) such as [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) , [noradrenaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Noradrenaline) and [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) are also thought to be involved to an extent. This can result in 5-MeO-DMT becoming dangerously toxic when combined with [MAOIs](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MAOIs) , [RIMAs](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/RIMA) , [SSRIs](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/SSRI) , [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) or any substance which acts as a [releasing agent](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Releasing_agent) or [reuptake inhibitor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Reuptake_inhibitor) of [monoamine neurotransmitters](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Monoamine_neurotransmitter) .

5-MeO-DMT is *O* -demethylated by polymorphic cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) to an active metabolite, [bufotenin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bufotenin) .

## Subjective effects

In comparison to its often relatively mild accompanying cognitive and visual effects, 5-MeO-DMT seems to have by far the most proportionally intense and overwhelming physical sensations found within the known psychedelic experience. These individual components are complex, overwhelming and seem to be equally capable of being interpreted as either extremely pleasurable and euphoric or uncomfortable and dysphoric.

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Spontaneous bodily sensations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_bodily_sensations)** - Perhaps the most remarkable sensation present in the 5-MeO-DMT experience. It increases the intensity of physical and tactile sensations to such an overwhelming extent that it can induce a sensation of sustained and repeatable full body orgasm within every nerve ending across the entire body, to a degree not found within any other psychedelic substance. The experience of this can result in the perception of having a difficulty sustaining the act of breathing. However, this is not a genuine or dangerous experience of [respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression) and is considered to be safe, although studies into this phenomenon are lacking.
- **[Physical euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria)**
- **[Tactile enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_enhancement)**
- **[Perception of bodily heaviness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perception_of_bodily_heaviness)**
- **[Bodily control enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bodily_control_enhancement)**
- **[Bodily pressures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bodily_pressures)**

- **[Muscle spasms](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_spasms)**
- **[Muscle tremors](/w/index.php?title=Muscle_tremors&action=edit&redlink=1)**
- **[Motor control loss](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motor_control_loss)**
- **[Respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression)**
- **[Nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea)** - Nausea is perhaps more pronounced and consistently produced on 5-MeO-DMT than any other psychedelic. It is not uncommon for users to vomit while in an unconscious or semi-conscious state, which is one of the reasons supervised usage is always advised. However, some people report experiences with minimal or brief nausea. When nausea does occur, it typically disappears after the come up phase.
- **[Pupil dilation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pupil_dilation)**
- **[Skin flushing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Skin_flushing)**
- **[Spatial disorientation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spatial_disorientation)**
- **[Temperature regulation suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Temperature_regulation_suppression)** ### Visual effects
 
- The visual effects of 5-MeO-DMT can be broken down into several components which progressively intensify proportional to dosage. In comparison to its consistently overwhelming and intense accompanying cognitive and physical effects, 5-MeO-DMT seems to have some of the most proportionally underwhelming visual effects found within the known varieties of the psychedelic experience. 
- **[Visual acuity enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_acuity_enhancement) or [Visual acuity suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_acuity_suppression)** - 5-MeO-DMT is equally capable of both decreasing and increasing visual acuity. The outcome of which effect will manifest seems to be chosen almost entirely at random and is largely setting dependent.
- **[Drifting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting)** ( [Morphing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Morphing) , [Breathing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Breathing) , [Melting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Melting) , [Flowing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Flowing) ) - In comparison to other psychedelics, this effect can be described as identical to DMT in its style, highly detailed, slow and smooth in motion and static in appearance.
- **[Colour shifting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_shifting)**
- **[Environmental orbism](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Environmental_orbism)**
- **[Recursion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Recursion)**
 
#### Geometry
 
The visual geometry that is present throughout this trip does not usually occur and in notable contrast to [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT) , does not extend beyond level 7 at its highest state (though some experiences involving nonvisual 8b have been reported). It is vaguely similar to [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT) although significantly smaller in size and more likely to manifest in darkness or without distractions. In terms of appearance, it can be comprehensively described through its [variations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Geometry#Variations) as intricate in complexity, abstract in form, equally organic and digital in feel, structured in organization, brightly lit, multicoloured in scheme, glossy in shading, equal in sharp and soft edges, small in size, fast in speed, smooth in motion, equal in rounded and angular corners, immersive in-depth and consistent in its intensity. 5-MeO-DMT is unique in that in breakthrough doses, it uniquely tends to result in [8B Geometry](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/8B_Geometry) over [level 8A](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/8A_Geometry) . ### Cognitive effects
 
- - **[Amnesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amnesia)**
- **[Analysis enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Analysis_enhancement)**
- **[Anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety)**
- **[Conceptual thinking](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Conceptual_thinking)**
- **[Catharsis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Catharsis)**
- **[Confusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Confusion)**
- **[Delusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusion)**
- **[Emotion enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Emotion_enhancement)**
- **[Memory suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Memory_suppression)** 
- **[Ego death](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ego_death)** - This effect is more consistent and reproducible on 5-MeO-DMT than on any other known substance.
- **[Mindfulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mindfulness)**

- **[Time distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Time_distortion)**
- **[Wakefulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness)** ### Auditory effects
 
- - **[Enhancements](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_enhancement)**
- **[Distortions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_distortion)**
- **[Hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_hallucinations)** ### Transpersonal effects
 
- **Note** : For a number of individuals these effects are consistently more reproducible and powerful with smoked or vaporized 5-MeO-DMT than they are with other “classical psychedelics” such as [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) or [mescaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mescaline) , this is most likely due to its very intense but relatively short-lived effects. These components are unique to 5-MeO-DMT in that for a majority of its users they are significantly more likely to manifest during "breakthrough" experiences as opposed to sub-breakthrough level trips. 
- **[Perception of eternalism](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perception_of_eternalism)**
- **[Perception of self-design](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perception_of_self-design)**

## Routes of administration

### Vaporization

When taken in its synthetic powder form, 5-MeO-DMT is typically [vaporized](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Routes_of_administration#Vaporization) , but can also be insufflated (although this is discouraged), and is active at a dose of as little as 2 mg. It has been suggested that it possesses roughly 4-5x the potency of DMT.

### Oral

As with DMT, 5-MeO-DMT has been demonstrated to be active orally when taken with an [MAOI](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MAOI) , but according to numerous reports this combination tends to be extremely unpleasant, producing a strong [body load](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Body_load) in addition to the risk of hypertensive symptoms and [serotonin syndrome](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome) , and is therefore strongly advised against. On both physical and psychological levels, it is considered to be substantially less safe than [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT) . [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

## Natural sources

### Colorado River toad

The Colorado River toad ( *Incilius alvarius* ), also known as the Sonoran Desert toad, is a toad found in northern Mexico and the southwestern United States. Its skin and venom contain 5-MeO-DMT and [bufotenin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bufotenin) (5-HO-DMT). Fresh venom can be collected without harm to the toad. This is done by stroking the parotid glands in the neck region onto a flat glass plate. The venom will take on the texture of rubber cement on drying, which can then be smoked. This product contains up to 15% 5-MeO-DMT, as well as [5-MeO-NMT](/w/index.php?title=5-MeO-NMT&action=edit&redlink=1) and [bufotenin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bufotenin) . [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

#### Dosage

Assuming that an average of at least 10% of the venom is 5-MeO-DMT:

- **Threshold:** 10 - 20 mg
- **Light:** 20 - 50 mg
- **Common:** 50 - 100 mg
- **Strong:** 100 - 200 mg

## Toxicity and harm potential

The toxicity and long-term health effects of recreational 5-MeO-DMT do not seem to have been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dose is unknown. This is because 5-MeO-DMT has a limited history of documented human usage.

Anecdotal evidence suggests that there are unlikely to be any negative health effects attributed to simply trying it by itself at low to moderate doses and using it very sparingly (but nothing can be completely guaranteed). [Independent research](https://www.google.com/) should always be done to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe before consumption.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this substance.

### Dependence and abuse potential

Like other [serotonergic psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonergic_psychedelics) , 5-MeO-DMT is considered to be non-addictive with a low abuse potential. There are no literature reports of successful attempts to train animals to self-administer 5-MeO-DMT — an animal model predictive of abuse liability — indicating that it does not have the necessary pharmacology to either initiate or maintain dependence.

Tolerance to the effects of 5-MeO-DMT is built almost immediately after ingestion. After that, it takes about 1 hour for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 2 hours to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). 5-MeO-DMT does not have a cross-tolerance with other [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) , meaning that after the consumption of 5-MeO-DMT psychedelics will not have a reduced effect.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **2C-T-X** - Both classes of compounds can be unpredictable alone.
- **2C-X** - The 5-MeO psychedelics can interact unpredictably to potentiate other psychedelics.
- **Cannabis** - May increase the risk of negative psychological effects such as [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) .
- **DOx** - The 5-MeO class of tryptamines can be unpredictable in their interactions, particularly increasing the risk of unpleasant physical side effects.
- **MDMA** - Some of the 5-MeO tryptamines are a bit unpredictable and should be mixed with MDMA with care.
- **Mescaline** - The 5-MeO class of tryptamines can be unpredictable in their interactions.
- **NBOMe** - The 5-MeO class of tryptamines can be unpredictable in their interactions and the NBOMes are known to be unpredictable even alone. This combination is best avoided.
- **Amphetamines** - The anxiogenic and focusing effects of stimulants increase the chance of unpleasant thought loops. The combination is generally unnecessary because of the stimulating effects of psychedelics.
- **Cocaine** - The anxiogenic and focusing effects of stimulants increase the chance of unpleasant thought loops. The combination is generally unnecessary because of the stimulating effects of psychedelics.
- **DXM** - Little information exists about this combination.
- **Tramadol** - Increased risk of [serotonin syndrome](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome) .
- **aMT** - Increased risk of [serotonin syndrome](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome) .
- **MAOIs** - Increased risk of [serotonin syndrome](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome) .
- **PCP** - Little information exists about this combination. May increase risk of psychosis and excessive stimulation.

Deaths from 5-MeO-DMT are rare. However, as a powerful [monoamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Monoamine) [reuptake inhibitor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Reuptake_inhibitor) (MRI), injury can occur when excessive doses are taken or when taken with substances such as [MAOIs](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MAOIs) , [RIMAs](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/RIMAs) , [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) and anything which act as a [releasing agent](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Releasing_agent) or [reuptake inhibitor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Reuptake_inhibitor) of [neurotransmitters](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurotransmitters) such as [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) and [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) . This has resulted in well documented fatal poisonings that could otherwise have been prevented.
