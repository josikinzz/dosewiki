**Ethylcathinone** (also known as **Ethylpropion** , **Ethcathinone** , and commonly as **ETH-CAT** ) is a [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) substance of the [cathinone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cathinone) chemical class that produces [stimulating](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulating) and [focus enhancing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Focus_enhancement) effects when [administered](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Routes_of_administration) . It is structurally related to [cathinone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cathinone) and [methcathinone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methcathinone) (MCAT), which broadly shares the effects profile of [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) or [methylphenidate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylphenidate) .

Of the [substituted cathinones](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Substituted_cathinones) , ETH-CAT reportedly produces the most moderate and residually long-lasting stimulation, with subtle effects that persist well after the initial rush. It has been described as having a more functional than recreational character due to the limited euphoria it produces for a stimulant, although its short active duration can promote [compulsive redosing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Compulsive_redosing) .

Very little data exists about the pharmacological properties, metabolism, and toxicity of ETH-CAT, and it has little history of human usage. It is primarily distributed as a [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) on the online grey market. In 2008 it was identified as an ingredient in both quasi-legal "party pills". It has also been reported as having been sold as "ecstasy" along with another [substituted cathinone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Substituted_cathinone) , [mephedrone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mephedrone) . It is highly advised to use harm reduction practices if using this substance.

## Chemistry

Ethylcathinone, or ETH-CAT, is a synthetic [alkaloid](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alkaloid) of the [substituted cathinone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Substituted_cathinone) class. Substituted cathinones are all derivatives of [cathinone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cathinone) , a stimulant substance which is structurally and functionally related to [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) and the principal active psychoactive component present in the [khat](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Khat) plant ( *Catha edulis* ). The cathinone molecule is comprised of a [phenethylamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamine) core featuring a phenyl ring bound to an amino (NH 2 ) group at the end of an ethyl side-chain that contains ketone group in the beta position.

In distinction to its N-methylated lower homolog, methcathinone (M-CAT), ETH-CAT possesses an additional ethyl substitution at R α . ETH-CAT can be thought of as the cathinone analog of [ethylamphetamine](/w/index.php?title=Ethylamphetamine&action=edit&redlink=1) given it has the same general formula, differing only by the addition of a single double-bonded oxygen (i.e. the ketone group).

## Pharmacology

Although the effects of ETH-CAT have not been formally studied on the same level as traditional [amphetamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamines) or other substituted cathinones like [methcathinone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methcathinone) , it is possible to speculate that like other simple [substituted cathinone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Substituted_cathinone) , it most likely acts principally as a [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) and [norepinephrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Norepinephrine) [reuptake inhibitor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Reuptake_inhibitor) . It however has been shown that ETH-CAT is a selective substrate for the norepinephrine transporter (NET).

The result of this is an effective increase in the levels of [catecholamine](/w/index.php?title=Catecholamine&action=edit&redlink=1) [neurotransmitters](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurotransmitters) like [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) and [norepinephrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Norepinephrine) in the brain by binding to and partially blocking the transporter proteins that normally clear these neurotransmitters from the synaptic cleft. This enables dopamine and norepinephrine to accumulate between the [synaptic clefts](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Synaptic_cleft) of key regions of the brain associated with reward, motivation, satisfaction and pleasure to extra-endogenous levels. This mechanism is thought to account for the [stimulating](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation) , [motivation enhancing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motivation_enhancement) and [euphoric](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Euphoria) effects that this substance produces.

## Subjective effects

At low to moderate doses, ETH-CAT has been reported as being a relatively functional and effective amphetamine-like stimulant for performing general productivity tasks. It has a noticeably short duration of activity combined with a tendency to produce long-lasting residual stimulation well after the main effects have worn off, which can promote patterns of [compulsive redosing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Compulsive_redosing) in order to maintain a steady level of the desired amount of physical and cognitive [stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation) .

However, at higher doses, it becomes less of a productivity-oriented stimulant and takes on a recreational character, perhaps owing to the inherently distracting nature of the type of [thought acceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_acceleration) and [cognitive euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_euphoria) it can induce. However, even at high doses, it is reported as falling short of many other, far more hedonic and recreational [substituted cathinones](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Substituted_cathinones) such as [mephedrone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mephedrone) , [methylone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylone) , and [methcathinone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methcathinone) (M-CAT).

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)**
- **[Physical euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria)**
- **[Dehydration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dehydration)**
- **[Appetite suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Appetite_suppression)**
- **[Increased heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate)**
- **[Teeth grinding](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Teeth_grinding)** - This component can be considered to be less intense when compared with that of [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) . ### After effects
 
- The effects which occur during the [offset](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Offset) of a [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) experience generally feel negative and uncomfortable in comparison to the effects which occurred during its [peak](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Peak) . This is often referred to as a "comedown" and occurs because of [neurotransmitter](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurotransmitter) depletion. Its effects commonly include: 
- **[Anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety)**
- **[Cognitive fatigue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_fatigue)**

- **[Motivation suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motivation_suppression)**
- **[Thought deceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_deceleration)**
- **[Wakefulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness)** ### Cognitive effects
 
- The cognitive effects of ETH-CAT can be broken down into several components which intensify proportional to dosage. The general head space of ETH-CAT is described by many as one of mental [stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation) , [focus enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Focus_enhancement) and [thought acceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_acceleration) coupled with a mild sense of [euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Euphoria) that is less pronounced than the head space of [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) , even at strong to heavy doses. 
- **[Analysis enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Analysis_enhancement)**
- **[Focus enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Focus_enhancement)**
- **[Motivation enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motivation_enhancement)**
- **[Anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety)** - This compound produces little to no anxiety unless it is taken in large doses or redosed repeatedly.
- **[Thought acceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_acceleration)**
- **[Thought organization](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_organization)**
- **[Cognitive euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_euphoria)** - The cognitive euphoria that this substance produces is often reported to be extremely mild compared to other stimulants in its class.
- **[Compulsive redosing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Compulsive_redosing)**
- **[Wakefulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness)** ### Visual effects
 
- - **[Visual haze](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_haze)**
- **[Peripheral information misinterpretation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Peripheral_information_misinterpretation)** - As with most other stimulants, this component primarily occurs at higher doses or after a sustained period of redosing.
### Experience reports

There are currently no anecdotal reports which describe the effects of this compound within our [experience index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Experience_index) . Additional experience reports can be found here:

## Toxicity and harm potential

The toxicity and long-term health effects of recreational ETH-CAT use do not seem to have been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dosage is unknown. This is because ETH-CAT has very little history of human usage. Anecdotal reports from people within the community who have tried ETH-CAT suggest that there do not seem to be any negative health effects attributed to simply trying this substance at low to moderate doses by itself and using it sparingly (although nothing can be completely guaranteed). Others have commented that its d-isomer form is virtually similar to the effects of [d-isomer amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) , and has thus far shown little reason to suspect that its toxicity is radically different (though this has yet to be scientifically validated). [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this substance.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

As with other [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) , ETH-CAT may also possess habit-forming or reinforcing properties. Compared with other stimulants, however, chronic use of ETH-CAT is more likely to be considered to be only mildly addictive with a comparatively low potential for abuse. Early studies demonstrate ETH-CAT suppresses cocaine self-administration in rhesus monkeys, without the adverse effects associated with older dopamine [releasing agent](/w/index.php?title=Releasers&action=edit&redlink=1) (e.g., amphetamine). [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] Despite this, ethcathinone may still be capable of causing psychological dependence among certain users.

Tolerance to many of the effects of ETH-CAT develops with prolonged and repeated use. This results in users having to administer increasingly large doses to achieve the same effects. After that, it takes about 2 - 3 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 3-5 days to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). ETH-CAT presents cross-tolerance with all [dopaminergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) , meaning that after the consumption of ETH-CAT all [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) will have a reduced effect.

### Psychosis

Abuse of compounds within the amphetamine chemical class at high dosages for prolonged periods of time can potentially result in a stimulant psychosis that may present with a variety of symptoms (e.g., [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/External_hallucinations) , or [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) ). A review on treatment for [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) and [methamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) abuse-induced psychosis states that about 5–15% of users fail to recover completely. The same review asserts that, based upon at least one trial, [antipsychotic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antipsychotic) medications effectively resolve the symptoms of acute amphetamine psychosis. Psychosis is known to arises only very rarely from therapeutic use.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **[MAOIs](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MAOIs)** - This combination may increase the amount of neurotransmitters such as dopamine to dangerous or even fatal levels. Examples include [syrian rue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Syrian_rue) , [banisteriopsis caapi](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Banisteriopsis_caapi) , and some [antidepressants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antidepressants) .
- **[Stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants)** - Ethylcathinone can be potentially dangerous in combination with other [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) as it can [increase one's heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate) and [blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure) to dangerous levels.

- **[25x-NBOMe](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25x-NBOMe) & [25x-NBOH](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25x-NBOH)** - 25x compounds are highly stimulating and physically straining. Combinations with ETH-CAT should be strictly avoided due to the risk of excessive [stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation) and heart strain. This can result in [increased blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure) , [vasoconstriction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction) , panic attacks, [thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops) , [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) , and heart failure in extreme cases.
- **[Alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol)** - Combining alcohol with [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) can be dangerous due to the risk of accidental over-intoxication. Stimulants mask alcohol's [depressant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressant) effects, which is what most people use to assess their degree of intoxication. Once the stimulant wears off, the [depressant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressant) effects will be left unopposed, which can result in blackouts and severe [respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression) . If mixing, the user should strictly limit themselves to only drinking a certain amount of alcohol per hour.
- **[DXM](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DXM)** - Combinations with DXM should be avoided due to its inhibiting effects on [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) and [norepinephrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Norepinephrine) reuptake. There is an increased risk of [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) and hypertensive crisis, or [serotonin syndrome](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome) with serotonin releasers ( [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) , [methylone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylone) , [mephedrone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mephedrone) , etc.). Monitor blood pressure carefully and avoid strenuous physical activity.
- **[MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA)** - Any neurotoxic effects of MDMA are likely to be increased when other [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) are present. There is also a risk of excessive blood pressure and heart strain (cardiotoxicity).
- **[MXE](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MXE)** - Some reports suggest combinations with MXE may dangerously increase blood pressure and increase the risk of [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) .
- **[Dissociatives](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociatives)** - Both classes carry a risk of [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) , [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) , and these risk may be multiplied when combined.
- **[Stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants)** - ETH-CAT may be dangerous to combine with other [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) like [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) as they can [increase one's heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate) and [blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure) to dangerous levels.
- **[Tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol)** - Tramadol is known to lower the seizure threshold and combinations with stimulants may further increase this risk.
- **[MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA)** - The neurotoxic effects of MDMA may be increased when combined with [amphetamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamines) .
- **[Cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine)** - This combination may increase strain on the heart to dangerous levels.

## Legal status

ETH-CAT is currently a grey area compound within many parts of the world. People may still be charged for its possession under certain circumstances such as under analogue laws and with intent to sell or consume.

- **Brazil** : On September 7, 2018, all cathinone analogues are controlled substances considered illegal to possess, use and distribute. This was made possible due to a blanket ban law appended to Portaria SVS/MS nº 344.
- **China** : As of October 2015 Ethylcathinone is a controlled substance in China.
- **Denmark** : Ethcathinone, along with mephedrone and flephedrone, was banned in Denmark on December 18, 2008.
- **Germany** : Ethylcathinone is controlled under Anlage II BtMG ( *Narcotics Act, Schedule II* ) as of July 26, 2012. It is illegal to manufacture, possess, import, export, buy, sell, procure or dispense it without a license.
- **Poland** : Ethylcathinone is a Group I-P controlled substance.
- **Sweden** : Ethylcathinone in list I.
- **Switzerland** : Ethylcathinone is a controlled substance specifically named under Verzeichnis E.
- **United Kingdom** : Ethylcathinone is a Class B drug in the United Kingdom as a result of the cathinone catch-all clause.
- **United States** : Ethylcathinone may be considered to be an analogue of amphetamine under the Federal Analogue Act.The Federal Analogue Act, 21 U.S.C. § 813, is a section of the United States Controlled Substances Act, allowing any chemical "substantially similar" to an illegal drug (in Schedule I or II) to be treated as if it were also in Schedule I or II, but only if it is intended for human consumption.
