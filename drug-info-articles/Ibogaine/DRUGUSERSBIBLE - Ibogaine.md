## Subjective Experience

Iboga is used ceremonially in Gabon and other Central and West African states, and
is fundamental and central to the Bwiti cult. It is used for rites of passage, spiritual
communion, resolution of pathological problems, communication with ancestors,
and many other intrinsic aspects of this indigenous society.

So respected is this plant that in 2000 the Council of Ministers of the Republic of
Gabon declared it to be a national treasure.

Beyond this region, its primary alkaloid, ibogaine, is used therapeutically to address
addiction. Clinics have been established in nations across the world. It is also claimed
to be a true aphrodisiac, when used in the correct circumstance.

However, reports suggest that due to a variety of pressures, including over-
harvesting, the plant population is now under threat, despite a number of
conservation efforts.

Iboga had been on my must-do list for a long time before I finally dipped my toe into
the water, one Saturday afternoon.

I had procured 5g from a well known vendor for initial testing: the idea being to start
low and to ditch the experiment if the substance was totally inactive, or was
nightmarish in some way. The duration, generally cited to be in excess of 24 hours,
and for which Erowid stated that “a user may be immobilised”, further promoted
caution.

For the first experiment I therefore consumed 1g, intending to take perhaps 2g or 3g
as a second pitch, and possibly go for the a more immersive experience sometime
thereafter. The mid-range did appear to be commonly suggested across specialist
Internet forums.

Although the 1g had been chosen primarily for safety reasons (containing about 25-
50mg of ibogaine), many commentators considered it to be a sufficient dose with
which to experience at least some psychoactivity. The following, for example, is
reported on Erowid:

```
"Even at this small dose, the effect was noticeable. I wasn't completely sure
about attributing the shift in my mental state to the impact of the drug
(Shulgin calls this +1, I think), but my later trial with a larger dose
reproduced a very similar state much more vividly (and dramatically).
```
```
There were no perceptual changes, but the mood would be best described as
tranquil lucidity. At this small dose, it was quite pleasant and kind. The
mental effect formed clearly approximately 2 hours after the ingestion, and
lasted for a few hours subsiding gradually in waves"
```
At pre-threshold and threshold levels like this, detailed commentary is difficult, but I
felt broadly as described in those notes. I felt serene, with a strange background
headiness, and physically I was a little tingly. I certainly felt that there was at least
some sort of effect in play, albeit minor.

I also noted that I wasn't ill, and that there was no body load. After a few hours, I
thought that was that.

But it wasn't.

On the Saturday, Sunday and Monday I had dreams. These were far more lucid than
normal. I didn't connect them to the iboga at all, particularly as on the Sunday I had
consumed alcohol.

It was the Monday night dreams that made me stop and take stock. What was
causing this? Was it something I had consumed last week?

I recalled that my entire intake comprised a few experimental bong hits of powdered
acacia confusa root on the Wednesday, which seemed a rather unlikely candidate.

Nonetheless I Googled, using search words of dream and acacia. There was nothing
to suggest any connection.

I performed a second search, but this time using iboga and dream.

Bingo!

There was a multitude of reports suggesting that iboga is an oneirogen. The
following, for example, was posted on the BlueLight forum:

```
"Also I forgot to mention, I have been having super intense, vivid, varied
dreams every single night. Sometimes really bizarre ones. Before the
ibogaine it was incredibly rare for me to remember a dream, much less be
present in my dreams, but lately I've had a number of dreams bordering on
lucid." ~ Xorkoth
```
There could be a degree of confusion here because large doses of ibogaine apparently
cause an awake dreamlike state. Here, however, I refer to dreams, whilst asleep.
Reports on the Internet seem to cover both of these states, and often, in a confusing
manner.

I should also note that I woke feeling refreshed and rested on each occasion.

This experience, of course, influenced my plans, as I felt that a period of
contemplation was sensible, prior to diving deeper. I fully intend to return to this
strange plant when I am able to find the time to do justice to it.
