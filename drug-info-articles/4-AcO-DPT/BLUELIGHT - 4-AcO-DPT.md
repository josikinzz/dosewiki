I can not find any info. on this material - does anyone know anything?  Tikhal has only 4-HO-DPT listed:


"DOSAGE : unknown


DURATION : unknown


QUALITATIVE COMMENTS : (with 20 mg, orally) "Possible threshold, nothing more."


EXTENSIONS AND COMMENTARY : Here is another case where there just aren't enough observations to determine at what level the activity will be seen, or what form it will take. The track record is pretty well established with the oxygen-free analogue DPT, and it would be hard to imagine a loss of potency by incorporating the "psilocin signature", the 4-hydroxy group. This threshold suggests something is nearby. It is a shame that the compound is so difficult to make."

([Tikhal/ 4-HO-DPT](http://www.erowid.org/library/books_online/tihkal/tihkal20.shtml))


Seems that it's available and I'm curious to know if anyone has sampled?

^ why should you try it just because its available?


I'd pass on this one personally until more people tried it. I am wary of the high dosage required.

not talking about 4aco-dIpt are you? 4aco-dipt wiki: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4-Acetoxy-DIPT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4-Acetoxy-DIPT)


I would guess that 4aco-dpt is pretty rare which would be logical considering the lack of info on this substance.

oh ha, yes I did not consider that perhaps the poster may be confused and talking about 4-aco-diisopropyltryptamine not 4-aco-dipropyltryptamine (COMPLETELY different molecules! just consider the differences between the simple T's: DiPT and DPT!).

the poster is perhaps confused, but was talking about

**

4-ACO-DPT**


i won't be acquiring 4-ACO-DPT w/out more info, curious about it though.


here's another strange option, anyone heard about

**

2-ME-DMT**?


From [TIKHAL](http://www.erowid.org/library/books_online/tihkal/tihkal34.shtml):


DOSAGE : 50 - 100 mg, orally


DURATION : 4 - 6 hrs


QUALITATIVE COMMENTS : (with 50 mg, orally) "There was tingling everywhere but it faded after about three hours. Nothing else."


(with 75 mg, orally) "Very mild stomach rumbling during the first hour, with no other effects until the 65 minute point. Then there was the onset of as very mild relaxed feeling followed by intermittent skin alerting, especially on the head and neck. No visuals. Sexual activity at 90 minutes showed marked enhancement of both the pre-climactic and orgasmic phase, which was confirmed by repeat activity at 120 and 180 minutes. When I switched on TV to a familiar news announcer, I thought that he had a cold because his voice sounded lower than normal, and throaty. Later I picked up a phone to call a friend and both the dial tone and the touch-tones sounded very unusual. Music at this point sounded normal, but I am sure that some tonal perception was altered by this drug. The effects seemed almost gone by 4 hours and were undetectable by 5 hours. Appetite seemed unaffected throughout, and dinner at the 5-hour point was very good. No GI problems occurred, and there were no after effects the next day."


(with 90 mg, orally) "The entire body was becoming activated (in a good way) but not much going on in the head. I am mentally clear but with the entire touch system a bit more activated than I would choose. This peaked at 3 hours, and was gone in another 3 hours. Everything is tactile."


(with 120 mg, orally) "There is as much to be said for what didn't happen as for what did. No visual changes. No cloudiness of the thought processes. No motor impairment what-so-ever. There was some down-shifting of music, with some distortion, which was overall more annoying than interesting. But I am glad I am alone because I cannot wear clothing. Anything touching the skin makes all my hair stand on end. The erection of my nipples is almost painful. Exploring sexual stimulation is seemed a little dangerous but explored anyway. The climax was disappointing. Too much activity of a slightly scary sort. Never again at this level.

It'd be nice if this turns out to be legit and 4-AcO-DPT really gets out there.  How sure are you it's not just a scam trying to get people to take a risk on a lesser known or unknown vendor by offering extremely rare psychedelics?

4-ho-dpt and 4-aco-dpt seems interesting. 2-me-dmt isn't worth it. I wrote about it but can't find it on erowid ![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif)

DPT is one of the best psychedelics, IMO. That makes me really interested in 4-ho-dpt. I don't know if it will be anything at all like dpt, but I'd love to find out.


DPT seems to be better than mipt, dipt, and det. I've not tried the latter three, I am just going by trip reports. Maybe 4-ho-dpt will turn out to be the best of the 4-ho tryptamines.

Has anyone got more exp. with either 4-ho or 4-aco-dpt? 


25mg of 4-ho gave me a typical 4-ho comeup feeling but nothing more... But the 4-aco-dpt at 35mg was very smooth and relaxing while definately psychedelic... Redosing had no effect. 15mg smoked in a bong came on quickly, but didnt seem much more intennse than an oral dose of 35mg

the 4-aco-dpt wasnt too expensive, though I had to fork out for a decent amount. Ill experiment this coming week and do a full write up of the 4-ho, then the 4-aco the following week. egor/psood0nym, YGPM

This thread should probably be grafted to the big and dandy 4-ho-DPT one until it can stand on its own.


Egor, I know you've used both. Do you notice any differences between the 4-AcO and the 4-ho?  Early indications seem to be pointing to the 4-AcO being more potent, strangely enough (though other things could explain it). I've only used the 4-AcO, and just tonight too--posted in the B&D after the peak. 


16mg insufflated over 40 minutes resulted in a mild to moderate strength trip.  Effects were felt within 3 or 4 minutes of the first 4mg bump. I'd estimate that each bump plateaued within a half hour after insufflation.  I still feel a change in headspace now 4 hrs after the first dose, but it's in steady decline. More DPT than psilocin for sure. Given that there's already lots of psilocin-alikes, that's a valuable quality.

^I find little variance between the 2, but I have still not had a full strong +2 or +3 get to know the character of each individually. The biggest difference seems to be that 4-ho-dpt tastes FAR worse during the drip. I'll have to do an oral trial of each next to better feel out each chemical...

This stuff has a non-existant dose/response curve. A dose that is barely a threshold on one day is a solid+2 on another. This compound is hard to get a good feel for, but I'll sure as hell keep trying![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

^ That's interesting, thank you for the nice and informative post. Please keep us posted as you keep upping the dose.


I have a feeling this substance might show it's real beauty (and power) at higher dose levels. It is pretty much the same with DPT (at least for me) - it feels really benign and heady at lower doses, but if you keep pushing the dose it gets strongly visual and powerful - and since there definately seems to be a correlation between many of the other dialkyltryptamines and their 4-substituted analogues, it would be reasonable to assume that it might be similar with DPT and 4-xx-DPT. Possibly, the 4-HO version might be less benign than the 4-AcO, which also seems to be the case with 4-AcO-DMT/4-HO-DMT, and 4-AcO-MiPT/4-HO-MiPT, amongst others.


But all this is merely speculation, of course. It would be exciting to get more information on this substance. I will also be looking forward to trying it myself, which might not be taking place in very distant future actually.

I get the same capricious behavior from DPT.  I've still only used this stuff once (now that my school/work load has declined that should change), but my 16mg insufflated experience is in line with your assessment. 


Though most of the other measures of a trip's power were subdued at 16mg, I found the emotional and synaesthetic effects (manifested in me as hearing/musically-feeling the largely unformed phonetics of words that described what I was feeling during the trip) fairly pronounced.

6mg

12mg

15mg

19mg (yesterday, best trip with it yet, though not neccessarily intensity-wise...)

25mg


On 19mg I noticed a very distinct "breathing" of the wood grain while repairing the portion of my fence my dog has been trying to eat through to fuck my neighbors dog, and the grain would become translucent and overlap. Other than that and some trails, my vision seemed sharpened, not altered. Got 6 walleyes between 16" and 23" while it was still coursing through my system too. Very malleable. Should mention I smoked about 40mg of JWH-073 throughout the day too.

**Plugged seems far weaker than insufflated**


I hoped to IM 15mg of 4-AcO-DPT this afternoon.  I was able to get 2mg to go into solution by raising 20 insulin units of 5% acetic acid to boiling with it in it.  I then added 13mg more, 10 more insulin units of acetic acid, and about 50 units of saline, hoping to end up with a solution that I could inject without neutralizing. I brought the mixture to a boil, but not all the 4-AcO went into the solution.  Then something came up and I learned that this afternoon might not be the best time for what I anticipate could be a high +2/low +3 experience.  


Since I wasn't going to inject it, couldn't insufflate it, and an oral dose at this level is a waste of this rare and finite compound in my opinion, I plugged it to see how the ROA worked, sure that it would be short of IM intensity and that I could function reasonably well in the case that "the thing" did come up.  Onset took 15 minutes, and now I've plateaued at a +1. Insufflation of 16mg was far stronger than this. I won't plug this material again. So far, judging from others' reports and my own limited experience, IMO insufflation is the only ROA that has been proven practical and sensible; I'll try different ways of getting it into solution when I have a better opportunity.

so any more thoughts on why this one is so much less potent than its close relatives?  Would the hydroxy also likely be of similarly low potency?

A small batch was available in 2000, and I was gifted 150mg.  I took it as high as 70mg and only then did it get into +++ territory, and still managable.  Also, all the 4-Ho-tryptamines (save iprocin) have a 'psilocin' signature.  This one did not, it felt more more DPT/MiPT/DiPT.

@MGS: Are you referring to 4-ho or 4-aco-dpt?


I'd expect stronger effects than a nothing special ++ from 70mg of either orally.

**4-AcO-DPT**


I just got my hands on 4-AcO-DPT. However, there's almost zero information about it anywhere. I love both DPT and 4-HO-DPT and have extensive experiene with especially 4-HO-DPT.


I would like to hear if anyone have experiences with 4-AcO-DPT, dosages etc. I'm especially interested in how it compares to 4-HO-DPT, since it's my favourite RC tryptamine and it seems my source is down (fortunately I still have some in my stack). The only report of 4-AcO-DPT I've found is someone taking 25 mg and describing it as a "nice experience". I'm not someone who just likes to play a guinea pig with a compound theres's so little information about, but I'm extremely intrigued about the compound at the same time. Generally I love tryptamines (except 5-MeO's) and both DPT and 4-HO-DPT are pure magic.


Start low and work your way up, sure, that's my way, but it would still be nice to hear what others have to say about this intriguing compound (expensive and quite rare, admittedly).

I'd speculate, given other similar substances, that it's likely to be a very very similar experience to 4-HO-DPT, but with a somewhat longer duration, a slower come up, and probably a slightly higher dosage for an experience of equal intensity.


That said, I don't have experience with either 4-HO-DPT or 4-AcO-DPT myself, so I'd love to hear anyone's experiences.

My usual doses with 4-HO-DPT are 50 mg for a moderate trip and 100 mg for a strong trip. I think I'll start with testing with 25 mg and then bump the dose. It will be a few weeks before I try it, but I'll definately write a report here and a comparison vs 4-HO-DPT.


I must say I'm a bit saddened that 4-substituted DPT has gained so little recognition. They are magical tryptamines, very unique with much potential. TIHKAL even says that it's unsure if e.g. 4-HO-DPT even is active...I found that very strange. On the one hand there's the good side, few know about them so they're not likely to be of interest to authorities, but on the other hand 4-HO/4-ACO-DPT are very expensive and not so easy to find (= very little or no information about them).


Edit: Just snorted 25 mg. Nice stuff ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) There's definately potential in this stuff. It's a shame it's so expensive though.

I've tried it a few times. There's no difference between it and 4-ho-DPT that I can't attribute to natural subjective variance between trips, but Jesusgreen's comments account for the general trend in differences between the ho and AcO versions of 4-subs and it likely holds here.  The 4-AcO version is probably also more stable. Just treat it like 4-ho-DPT (50 mg rectal or insufflated for a solid idea of what they're about, with insufflated being a little more potent). 


It's a shame there's no salt of the two versions made yet that's both stable and readily soluble in water (there's one report of the ho being injected using a very high volume of water, though, but that sounds unpleasant). If they could be injected IM easily it would bring down the cost per dose quite a bit.  I've been using psychedelics for 15 years and the two 4-sub-DPTs may be my favorites (certainly I'd put them alongside DPT, 2C-E, and 4-AcO/ho-DMT in being worthwhile).  They don't resemble mescaline, but they have the same subtle yet deep quality, like a haunting melody. They can evoke extremely powerful emotions and spiritual feelings without requiring a strong foundational intensity to the trip, just by "plucking the right chords." They're also highly unique, having more of a DPT signature instead of the psilocin-like qualities of most other 4-sub-tryptamines.  I recommend either in combination with aMT.

Thanks, I did a search but didn't find the thread. Indeed, this feels very much like 4-HO-DPT. The main difference i noticed was that this does not hit you as fast as 4-HO. 4-HO hits you in a minute, 4-AcO begins building up (quite fast) after about 5 minutes. There's the same bodyload, and my stomach swells (why on earth does all form of DPT's make my stomach swell like a balloon?).


And yes, I have to agree with you about 4-HO/4-AcO-DPT being quite unique psychedelics. They really don't resemble much else. I did read from TIHKAL that 4-HO-DPT is a difficult compound to make. I guess that's the only rational reason for it being so expensive.

Got a 50mg sample but it was only 30mg


Had a plate of Kellogs frosties for my breakfast


1128 9mg snorted very easy going up no sting

1134 drip is easy just a slight bitter taste ....tickly want to sneeze feeling

1137 warm glow on cheeks...feeling it come on strong, nose running keep holding back sneeze...fingers feeling nice as i type this

1140 this feels real nice

1141 another 7 mg snorted 


As soon as you snort you get instant euphoria smooth and soft then it fades slightly


Snort up each nostril brought runny eye both sides but its sort of good feeling really tickles nostril rather than sting


1150 feeling really really nice warm glow up the back of my neck


Trippy now....very trippy


1155 hope theres more to come it just isnt strong enough


1204 another 4mg snorted...a fiendish tryptamine?


Feeling let down now not worth the money glad it was a sample


Makes me want to take something like 4 ho mipt now lol


1210 feeling lovely again but doubt it will last


3 mins later you can feel it dying


1217 yep you guessed another 4mg snorted


1237 feeling nice again tranquil serene but thats probably more to do with brian eno than 4 aco dpt


Sitting here laughing at how underwhelming the whole thing has been


This would be great if you wanted to escape into a bit of peaceful serenity while her indoors nips out to the bingo for 2 hours but it would have to be 20 quid a gram rather than 100 lol


1250 feeling really really nice now and its lasting...maybe the last 4mg finally got me to the right dose as it feels beautiful now


0135 almost baseline again


0137 another 4mg snorted 

0145 total now taken 30mg


I reckon this stuff needs a much higher dose to begin with and at the price its just not worth it...no horn, erotic or otherwise, no visuals of any kind, probably get better effects from some `real` am2201.


Damp squib!

An uncommon one with far too few reports on it, I'm sure. But it does have a thread which I merged this into just now.


I think this one is in my collection but it's not in the top 10 of my to-do list, not because it seems bad not at all. It's just the overabundance of wonderful things. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

^The posts I've seen regarding oral use indicates even 75mg is underwhelming. With a chem this rare oral is a waste for me. 50 mg insufflated or rectal is more like it, though TheAppleCore had [a fairly strong experience](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/605097-%284-AcO-DPT-20-mg%29-First-trial-A-Mirror-to-the-Mind) at just 20 mg insufflated. It might be worth trying oral if you find you're sensitive to it like that.

Ended up doing absolutely nothing. I'm pretty surprised that I didn't even get some mild psychedelia. So, yes, for the record, orally dosing this chemical is simply not an option.

Just to add my 2p: A few weeks back I insufflated around 25mg. It's a weird one for sure. There wasn't much going on until T+0,5h, after that a transition to a very peculiar headspace took place which didn't lead up to a discernible peak but definitely was fully developed before T+1,5h. I kept asking myself if calling the compound a drug wasn't essentially misleading. What I experienced wasn't some form of intoxication, rather the opposite. There was some background tension and uneasiness I hoped to diffuse by visiting a nearby public pool and swim a few lengths. No visuals, no body high, no detectable distortion of any other of my senses, very very clear headed, none of that. So what did it do then, you might ask. My perception was cranked up quite a bit for once. I couldn't help but noticing a torrent of minute details I wouldn't usually be aware of, and was completely lost in thought about the architecture history of the little town I'm living in. No intensified colors, but childish joy when looking at brightly colored surfaces, especially yellow and orange. Once I was in the pool I kept drilling through a lot of issues and problems I needed to resolve, things I had to organize. My reasoning was almost too sharp and fluid like a razor, pitilessly weighing my actions and work and those of others with an almost brutal clarity. All the while I kept ploughing through the water without any hint of fatigue or exhaustion like the energizer bunny on steroids. This went on for 5km straight. Best description would be a state of clairvoyant super-sobriety, useful and interesting but not exactly enjoyable let alone hilarious. I felt my energy level draining and the tension from the rising muscle acidity, but wasn't compelled to slow down or tempted to give up. The drug didn't deceive me about what was left of my dwindling resources, but I felt that I'd be able to keep this up until total cramping or heart failure would force me too -provided the 4-aco-dpt wouldn't abate before that point. Let's hope the olympic committee has put this one one the list of doping agents, because I can see this one doing not a half bad job. My appetite was a little suppressed but not completely killed, I ate but there was no joy in it. The whole thing was over within 6 hours. Puzzling, but interesting enough to do it again sometime in the future, especially since the taste/smell was bearable and mild, no hint of the horrible dpt drip.

So is there a main difference between 4-AcO-DPT and 4-HO-DPT? Any information would be very appreciated ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

^ I haven't tried 4-HO-DPT, but the consensus seems to be that the two compounds are very similar, with 4-HO-DPT being a bit more potent, and brief (shorter overall trip).

Tried the 4-HO-DPT yesterday, 25mgs sniffed followed approx. 1h later by another 10mgs plugged. This one is reaaaaally nice, had a phantastic evening just lying on the couch, listening to music and travelling trough the endlessness of the my mind.


Dunno why people say intranasal is more efficient, as far as my little experience goes, i've found plugging to be a far more economic ROA. But i'm a bit unsure since i was really spaced out in the end.


Funny thing is, i initially didn't felt that high until i laid down and closed my eyes while listening to the music, when the effects crept up on me and increased slow but steadily. Duration was at least a good 5hrs with redosing (but not including the afterglow).


Conclusion: great substance! A somewhat higher dose could be absolutely awesome, and i'm really looking forward to try the parent compound DPT asap.

Is it just me or does 4-HO/ACO-DPT feels less serotonergic than DPT itself?

But how would you compare it to 4-HO/ACO-DPT? IME DPT felt more serotonergic, but i'm a bit unsure tbh. 4-HO was definitely more potent. They both work with staggered doses as far as my little experience with those two goes, but would you say doing this works better than ingesting one large amount?

This surprised me too, but DPT is actually one of the most serotonergic psychedelics if you judge by SERT/5-HT2A binding ratio. According to the paper below, DPT binds to the serotonin transporter at a dose 10x lower than required for appreciable 5-HT2A affinity, which probably means the drug also functions as a serotonin reuptake inhibitor. It also has unusually high affinity for the 5-HT1A receptor, which may also play a role in psychedelic activity. Unfortunately, the paper has been discredited to some extent, but it's still one of the best resources we've got.

Well, after seeking out 4-AcO-DPT or 4-ho-DPT from four different sources, I was finally able to get this most recent purchase of 4-AcO-DPT fumerate to go into solution for IMing, and holy shit is that the way to do it! I was able to get 40 mg in 1.3 mL of 2:13 sterile water:5% acetic acid by heating it in a small metal measuring cup on an electric stove burner. I injected 1 mL of that to start on top of 60mg of plugged MXE, so about 31 mg of 4-AcO-DPT total, and I'm glad I didn't finish off the rest.


4-AcO-DPT may be the most profoundly psychedelic substance I've ever used, and I've used dozens. Never before have I been so caught up within the inter-reflections of a moment like that. It was so strange. I found myself begging for forgiveness because I thought I had broken some law of existence. It was madness. I kept reminding myself to calm down because recursive thoughts began piling up faster than I could track them. It was as if my ego was falling into its own image in an infinity mirror. I'd put my fingers to my jugular to take my pulse and find I was perfectly calm, but I couldn't believe it because the rate at which I was reflecting on my own abstract notion of self was bordering on being physically painful.


"What have you done?" (what am I asking?) ... I'm so lost.


Things were happening so fast I felt vibrated free of the process. Ultimately I had to scream out inside myself: 


"You can STOP . THINKING." 


And I did stop, or a part of me did, but this telescopic projection seemed to somehow continue ahead in time then fall back to the present moment as a shattered temporal echo of my identity. At that point I was simply astonished by the joy of being, and I felt like the surface of a lake in the rain.

Just wow^ !


I get a pronounced feeling of holyness from DPT, I get why it is used as a sacrament...

However DPT is jittery for me, as if I am trying to pull off a megaton rocket launch in a go-kart.


How does 4-AcO-DPT compare with that? And I wonder if lower dose IM would prove to be workable or if it is just qualitatively like that with that ROA.

e.g. IM 5-MeO-DMT feels to me like it couldn't be in the league of manageably mild however you dose it.

This is true.  I'd say IMed 5MeODMT is easily as strong as smoking it, just stretched out.  I've tried many other psychedelics via IMed and smoked and in no other case is IM as potent as smoking.

4-AcO-DPT and 4-ho-DPT aren't nearly as tremulous as DPT in my experience. After last night I'm not sure how much more I can say, though. Every other experience I've had of ho/AcO has been far more mild than this last experience (not disappointing in any sense, quite blissful, but damn, comparatively this was a shocker). I have IM'd 4-ho-DPT once before with aMT, which I posted about in the ho thread, but either the other batches I got weren't as pure or, far more likely, more precipitated back out of solution before I could draw it up into the syringe than I estimated. I had to abort four previous attempts at IMing before that because the stuff is really stubborn and clogged up the needle, but for whatever reason this last order of 4-AcO-DPT was far more easy to tame (all my previous ho/AcO buys have reportedly been fumerates, too, so I'm not sure what to think). I think a small dose IMd would be far more nice and relaxed like most of my insufflated experiences, but 30 mg IMd with MXE was a wild ride. It certainly seemed to be mostly the work of the 4-AcO, but I think the MXE mania may have seriously sped things up, too. I just don't know to what degree. In any case by IMing the bang for my buck with this compound seems to have taken a giant leap.

The only other tryptamine I've IMed on top of MXE so far is synthetic psilocin. The experience was certainly sped up and more confusing than with ketamine or DXM, but it wasn't much stronger than I expected. Perhaps there's a greater jump in potency between insufflated and IMed 4-AcO-DPT than most other tryptamines (for most it's about double in my experience). I won't really be able to say until I IM it again by itself, but for now I'd recommend IMing no higher than 20 mg for somebody's first time assuming no psychedelic tolerance.

I told you! 40mgs IM of 4-HO-DPT was pretty easily one of the most potent experiences I've ever had. Like you, I've ventured pretty far and was not expecting such a through whipping. I found insufflation far more forgiving. The IM come up reminded me of a similar feeling of blasting off on DMT albeit not that rushy though it was still pretty crazy. If I manage to get more sometime soon I would probably attempt a go at 10-15mgs IM hoping for a lighter experience.

Yes, I have experience with them both. It's really hard to judge because, as I've written about in the 4-ho-DPT thread, the qualitative effects of the doses I'm most familiar with (35-50mg insufflated) are more temperamental and synesthetic in their focus than most psychedelics. Typically the oh versions of 4-sub tryptamines are qualitatively more turbulent and serious than their AcO counterparts (which are often thought of as "smoother" and more euphoric), and that's a side of them that's revealed most distinctly in their more cognitive effects. However, my IM 4-AcO-DPT experience was far more rough and tumble than any of my 4-ho-DPT experiences, but as stated, that could have to do with an unexpected potency increase relative to insufflation, combining it with MXE, or a large potency difference between syntheses (this last possibility strikes me as least likely). 


Shulgin laments how difficult 4-ho-DPT is to make in TIHKAL. I'm not sure what the details are of how the currently available 4-AcO-DPT is synthesized but if I had to go with one I'd chose it because if I recall correctly from what others have stated the AcO versions are both easier to get right and they're more stable (esp. fumerates). In any case, most people go with ho versions when they're looking for a little more unwieldy sort of experience, but, assuming my last combo session is reflective of how 4-AcO-DPT is in isolation, if one were to IM it I doubt "tame" would come to their mind as a description.

Heh, yeah, I certainly expected that 4-ho/AcO-DPT might have a bite at higher doses, particularly when IMed, there was just a lot of factors at play here making it difficult to guess at the time exactly how much stronger the experience would be. I'm now wondering if an experience I had a few years ago, the most profound of my life, had more to do with 4-ho-DPT than I thought. 


I ended up having what I believe was a left-hemisphere partial seizure well after I thought the effects of 4-ho-DPT were over (I'd never had a seizure before then, nor have I since). I kept getting psychedelic thoughts and CEVs while I was trying to go to sleep after a very long night. Over a few hours I took 4 mL 1,4 butanediol, diphenhydramine, and had a few mixed drinks trying to just pass out. But the 4-ho-DPT effects just would not be denied. So instead of going unconscious like that much of all those depressant drugs might have typically resulted in I had a highly symbolic seizure vision of my own conception while the right side of my body jerked around! The combination of all those things had me pretty convinced I'd accidentally killed myself, heh. I've got most of that report written but there's some essential connections to an 35g mimohuasca/40g P.Torch "overdose" the weekend before that have been extremely difficult to include in a way that I think will make sense to readers. 


In any case, the next night after the 4-AcO-DPT experience described above I experienced some mild brain zaps while going to sleep. Dondante notes in post #61 that:


> DPT is actually one of the most serotonergic psychedelics if you judge by SERT/5-HT2A binding ratio.

I'm wondering if 4-ho/AcO-DPT might also have relatively powerful SERT activity, and if that may have played a role in both the brain zap symptoms and the seizure in combination with 1,4 BDO years ago. I don't think 4-ho/AcO-DPT are physiologically dangerous, but if this suspicion is true it's worth considering when combining either with other drugs (such as MXE, which is an SRI).

Yesterday I wanted to low-dose a psychedelic to buff my day with a little magic polish, and I settled on 4-AcO-DPT as my instrument of choice. What an excellent choice it was! Lifted me right out of a depressive funk. I got done some work that I'd been putting off, too.


And, as an added bonus, I felt particularly well-rested this morning, and I feel all-around fantastic today, like my whole body is recharged and... relaxed.


When I first tried 4-AcO-DPT, it was (weirdly) my first 4-X tryptamine, so I had no real basis for comparison, but now that I've tried 4-AcO-DMT, 4-HO-MiPT, and 4-HO-MET, I'm fairly confident in saying that 4-AcO-DPT is the most euphoric and positive of the bunch, for me. The euphoria reminds me a lot of LSD, but in my opinion it's a much better choice for a nootropic go-about-your-daily-affairs psychedelic than acid, because it is more clearheaded, which allows for better focus.


I need a little bit more experience with 4-HO-MiPT (my other favorite) to be sure, but 4-AcO-DPT might just be my #1 favorite 4-X tryptamine. It's shameful how tiny this B&D thread is.

It's because probably hardly anyone has tried it (myself included).  What was your dose?

Funny I was just thinking this morning how its a pity the 4-sub-DPTs are so rare and how I'd like to try one. Glad to hear the positive review!


Can you give a quick rundown of your dosage, ROA, intensity and the timeline (onset, peak duration etc)?

Sounds nice, TheAppleCore. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) This like most (possibly all) trip reports on 4-AcO-DPT makes me even more excited to try this one some day.

I took 6 milligrams (insufflated) in the early afternoon, around 1 P.M. It hit me quickly (as usual), within fifteen minutes, and was probably peaking forty-five minutes in. I took another 3 mg bump at maybe 3:30 P.M., at which point the effects were still in full swing, which pushed me from a mild energy-boost into something a bit more "trippy" with some very slight OEVs, but still only a +1 on the Shulgin scale. It's hard to say when the effects ended, because I still feel a serene afterglow today, although I felt more or less sober by around 10:00 P.M. when I went to bed.


Mind you, this is all from memory, since apparently I'm an incompetent psychonaut who keeps no written record.


It's worth noting that I became overly emotional about some negative things today, which I think is also an after-effect, in addition to the euphoric afterglow that I mentioned.

Wow, you're right, that's the second time I've completely forgotten I tried this.


I hear really great things about 4-HO-DPT and 4-AcO-DPT from the few who have tried them.  I'd love to get my hands on some, especially since I've fallen back in love with tryptamines recently.  Actually I have yet to try plain DPT beyond a threshold dose also (the threshold dose was nice).

Haha. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) I also haven't tried DPT above a threshold dose, which honestly made a me a little nervous and shaky. I have heard a good number of people say that 4-HO-DPT and 4-AcO-DPT compare to 4-AcO-DALT though, and having just tried a fuller dose of that earlier I can certainly say that if that's the case then I'd definitely be excited to try these (as if I wasn't already). Tryptamines are great, I don't know what I would do without them. Though I have to admit that you have actually made me start obsessing over phenethylamines again from your posts lol.

Hehe. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


Actually I have fallen in love with tryptamines again recently.  I enjoy plenty from the 3 main categories (phen, trypt, and lysergamide), but there's something special about the tryptamines.

No disagreements here. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) I find the 4-substituted ones to be particularly amazing personally, and a lot more diverse than a lot of people give them credit for. I'm so anxious right now to hear back from my friend on that possible 4-HO-DPT lol. I've been told that there's that and potentially also 4-HO-MPT (dun dun).

Lucky you. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  Currently I've got 4-HO-MiPT which I love, it's a very interesting psychedelic.  So far I've found it to be no good for ego dissolution but amazing for working through personality/mental/emotional stuff, or connecting with others in meaningful ways, while simultaneously having a great time.  Some of them aren't so great for socializing or doing much other than sitting/laying there and getting dissolved (I like to use high doses of tryptamines to get their full potential), but it sounds like 4-HO/AcO-DPT may be in the middle somewhere.

Oh, you and I seem to be on the same wavelength there. I was given 4-HO-MiPT for the first time by a good friend who experiences strong visual and mental effects from it at low doses, but for me even at 30 mg I found it very easygoing and sociable. I was meeting a few new people that day and we were all tripping together, and I felt connected to them in ways that I hadn't since the carefree early drug days of high school. The only psychological effects were joy and relaxation so heavy it was hard to speak at first, and the visuals were mild but beautifully flowing and electric. Since then it has become probably my favorite psychedelic to take alone at lower doses, where the mind is free enough to open up and become quite visual in its own way despite not even feeling too intoxicated to just keep going about the day, whether it's introspective or just routine. Yoga I found to be especially rewarding on it.


I'm curious, what do you think of 4-HO-MET (if you've tried it)? It seems like a lot of people I know get hit much more intensely by one of these two than the other; my friend who gave me with 4-HO-MiPT does not get much in the way of visuals or mental changes from 4-HO-MET, but it gives me some of the most overwhelming visuals of any substance, and the mindset is very present and LSD-like. Even without it, the visuals alone are capable of causing out-of-body experiences through sensory overload on occasion. Massively different responses, clearly.


Yeah, 4-HO-DET is one of those for me that is best for just melting into nothingness on. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) Literal out-of-body experiences (seeing myself from a distance and the like) happen to me on it quite frequently with meditation or music, or sometimes just spontaneously. I have read a report of this happening on 4-AcO-DPT before and I saw shades of it my first time on 4-AcO-DALT while meditating as well, so I'm definitely anticipating some overlap with my experiences there. TheAppleCore's trip report makes it sound very nice on the mind and body as well, I'm looking forward to it. 4-HO-DET has that extremely easy to handle feeling for me but it is very psychological, whereas 4-AcO-DALT was more clearheaded but was a heavier high, more euphoric and disorienting; it will be very interesting to see where this one takes it.

I find 4-HO-MET to be weak in comparison to 4-HO-MiPT, but I haven't taken it above I think 25mg.  At 25mg 4-HO-MiPT is significantly better for me in every way, and at 30mg it's pretty sublime.  I want to try it at 40mg, and I want to try 4-HO-MET at 40mg also to see what unfolds.  I find 4-HO-MET to have a similar type of euphoric trip, but it seems much calmer and with less content.  Also I don't feel as sociable on it.  4-HO-MiPT starts to hit me with rushes of feel-good and euphoria and it unfolds from there.


I have tried 4-AcO-DET, not 4-HO-DET, but I found it very different.  It was VERY psychological in nature, fast-flowing thoughts, not really euphoric at all.  In fact it started out pretty difficult, I found myself contemplating on my mortality and becoming rather obsessed with it, with my body aging (I'm 32 but the process is always happening).  I worked through it and ended up having a really great and useful trip... but not something I'd take often.

Ah, the individual differences are astounding! I've actually been thinking of pushing 4-HO-MiPT up to the 40-50 mg range because I don't feel like I've gotten to really see its full potential yet, but 25 mg of 4-HO-MET is a very intense trip for me. I'm surprised that you don't get more out of it actually, because to me it is about as close as it gets to the 2C-x family (or what I've seen of it so far). It does have typical tryptamine visual style in many ways, but it also gives me a distinctly digital feeling that comes with energy, overly bright colors, lots of rainbow visuals, and vivid patterning all that remind me especially of 2C-I, and to an extent 2C-B (which I have much less experience with), especially with all the greens. The basic type of geometry I get on 4-HO-MET is even actually not unlike what I get from those blotters I took that I'm fairly certain were some DOx(s). I wonder if you will get these kinds of effects as well at higher doses, and good luck with that. The highest I've pushed with it was 50 mg and it was still quite lucid and easygoing at that dose, and calmer than low doses. The visual effects also became significantly more DMT-like, but still also had the same highly externally active style and even had some pinwheeling effects similarly to those blotters again.


As for 4-AcO-DET and 4-HO-DET, I haven't been able to distinguish any different psychedelic effects between them yet when taken orally, but the former seems a little calmer to me (physically, not mentally). What you described sounds pretty much like my experiences with it.... Good times. :D I may have some odd desires, but I really love the trip it gives. To be honest, sometimes I feel like 4-HO-DET, 4-AcO-DET, 4-HO-DiPT, and 4-AcO-DALT are practically different types of drugs from psilocybin, 4-AcO-DMT, 4-HO-MET, 4-AcO-MET, and 4-HO-MiPT, just in effect of course. The latter group fairly consistently gives me trips which have a lucid headspace, significant euphoria, and brightly colored geometric visual effects mixed with visionary architecture reminiscent of DMT. On the other hand, the former group for me primarily has visual effects which feel dark and subtle, with lots of smoke-like trails, blending colors and textures, and disorienting auras, but interwoven with powerful mind's eye visions that can grow to overlap reality, along with a heavier focus on mental stimulation than physical euphoria and very strong psychological effects despite remaining relatively in control. Something I have begun to recognize in it is a general feeling of a "loosening" of the mind, where my thoughts become slowly more absurd and I don't quite care.... On 4-AcO-DET it felt near psychosis once, but I wasn't acting crazy still, just feeling it. 4-AcO-DALT was the most visual and easiest on the mind of them but it definitely felt like it could take me into the abyss easily at a higher dose.... 4-HO-DiPT on the other hand was the least visual but also took me closer to that edge, my mind was scattered.


I personally love that state of mind, but I can definitely understand why it wouldn't be for some. What I really like so much about it is just being able to meditate into it and allow it to take me on a wild ride through my subconscious.... They show me things that just make other psychedelics feel surface-level by comparison, which makes sense because being so personal and intimate is part of their charm, but sometimes I like there to be more layers torn away than that.... That's where these good old larger tail tryptamines come in. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) Just from what I've heard, I imagine that DPT may be like this as well, but I can't yet verify. It seems to match some descriptions though, and that gives me hope that 4-HO-DPT and 4-AcO-DPT have this quality as well.... I really am in love with it at the moment, it's definitely me favorite kind of trip! Though I do like pretty much any kind of trip.

My pet has had good experiences with it insufflated.  From 10-40 mg does a nice job.  I'd say it is under-rated, and it is one of my favorite tryptamines.  I overlooked it when I first obtained it.  My pet has experiences with 4-aco-dmt, 4-ho-met, DIPT, MIPT, 4-meo-mipt, 5-meo-mipt, and dmt (as well m4gic fungus)... as far as tryptamines.


I am curious as to whether anybody has tried vaping or smoking the substance.  A friend recommended not to try it, since it is such a rare compound (he said it would possibly be a waste).  My pet wants to try it... I will report back.

^ we don't use euphemisms like "my pet" here, everyone knows it's you. kindly edit your post as nobody wants to read thru that sort of silliness; please refer to the bluelight user's agreement you were linked to when you signed up.


also, this was a neat drug for me, I think i.m. would probably be the best route, vaping/smoking is a questionable RoA I tink.

IM with 4-HO-DPT was extraordinary. It was a bit of a bitch to get it in solution though, but totally worth it! The HO version of this is one of my favorite tryptamines.

during the later phase of my experimentation with psychedelics I found i.m. to be the best RoA for most of the Shulginalia, phenethylamines and tryptamines alike. the increased bioavailibility, of course, but the come-up and the various waves/peaks that they come in seem to be different, and more distinct, in a good way, when you can bypass the gi tract

Agreed one hundred percent! You nearly always avoid side effects, even with things like 2c-P/DOC you come up in about fifteen to thirty minutes, and like you said, very unique. Can be very euphoric. I like IM better than IV for everything it's feasible to do that way. I find the slow rising rush much sexier than being slammed in the face for a couple minutes. I would have the best trips IMing MXE/DPT, sometimes with DOC etc. I would IM it with great beloved tunes playing, just getting stoned as hell while I come up. Euphoria and trippiness that was unrivaled really. Just melting into whatever I'm sitting on. I had an insane trip like that with 4-HO-DPT IM'd with MXE. For the first thirty minutes it was so fucking intense.

it is surprisingly gentle even at highish doses

come to think of it is one of the few trips I would try these days

Defintely! Though the time I did 250mgs(had so much and lacked a stock of needles at the time so I figured go big or go home)on a good dose of LSD was pretty wacked out, in a positive way though. MET was probably my favorite simple tryptamine to IM. Always done with MXE. Really euphoric and light hearted in the best way possible. Still powerful though. I'd love to try DET. I think it'd be interesting if you tried a psychedelic again. See if you would still like it, all that sort of stuff. 


I defintely want to get some 4-HO-DPT again. I'm interested in hearing more about the AcO version too.

There are no AcO's in Tihkal....shulgin speculated they would identical to their hydroxy counterparts so he only explored them as far as I know.

Actually, 4-AcO-DET and 4-AcO-MiPT accounts are both described in TiHKAL under their respective 4-HO's pages.

They are but I doubt Sasha had enough personal experience with those two particularly to describe effects fully.


I'm interested in both and waiting for more personal reviews on the latest batches...8)

SO !


Holy hell 4-aco-dpt is one cool comnpound. I just got around to trying this gem yesterday.


At the beach, mixed this (incredibly wild tasting) stuff into a sierra nevada beer. 3PM. This girl i just met recently sipped it with me and then 

the madness ensued. WoW!  very unique feeling, i felt very honest and open and sociable; but we were also drinking lots of gin. 


Flash forward to 6 hours later: Re-dosed another 20mg each and ended up having quite the psychadelic experience at a korean restaurant. Couldn't figure out how to order off the menu. Lights flashing, crazy glow-light bar thing that is continually changing colors... Grabbing the girl next to me and hugging her close. Barely made it out of there; next thing you know were stealing beer from safeway. ok ok classic moves... psychadelia infused grooves.


Certain word are sticking out in our brain. The word 'interchangeably' is tripping us fricking out! Wrote it on the korean take out box to remember for later.


She asks: Why does the alphabet have to have order? Hmm. Good question. Crazy conversation ensue.


30 min later, playing cards with bunch of people, drinking cheap rum. Wow the re-dose has me more lit than ever. Its 5am and homegirl has work at 7:30am. needless to say she didnt make it and we just made love all morning.


Love this compound. 10/10 for me.

What dose did you take?  4-HO-DPT seems pretty weak (potency-wise), especially orally.  I've read of people taking 100mg for a strong experience.

^ the 4-aco-dpt i have seems to be about as potent as any 4-aco-dmt ive had. Or perhaps 7/8 as strong dose for dose.


My anecdote above is 20 mg initially for a +++ strong experience, and then 20mg again 5 hours later right back into that crazy space. (All oral doses)

Huh, wow.  That doesn't seem to line up with normal dosages for it... then again there isn't much on 4-AcO-DPT, mostly on 4-HO-DPT.  It's unusual for an AcO ester to be significantly more potent.  Of course, everyone is different.  I do wonder if what you received was actually some other more common tryptamine though.

Well its always possible, but it doesn't feel like any 4-ho-met, 4-aco-dmt, dpt, 4-ho-mipt, or 5-meo mipt that i've ever had. Feels very unique. Then again the experience might've been strengthened by the fact that the gal i dosed with has me feeling some type of way in her own right.


I'll be sure to re-assay it in a week or so with less gin involved, and report back. 


EDIT: Hey so i was looking back in this thread and it shows plenty of people dosing it around the 20mg range. Egor posted doses ranging from 6 to 25mg, with 19mg producing strong effects. So i don't know where you are getting the idea that my doses seem oddly low.

This has became available to me. I have 2g of 4-ho-dpt, does anyone know if this one is qualitively different enough to warrant buying some. I find 4-ho-met and 4-aco-met very different.

You probably should get some, so you can compare, for reaseach ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) Probably not too many people who have tried both and can compare them.

Yeah I ordered day before yesterday. Will report back once I have tried it, I am hoping it is different from the 4-HO as if fine 4-HO and 4-ACO-MET is.


once this arrives my 4 sub tryptamine collection looks like this:


4-ACO-DMT

4-ACO-MET

4-ACO-MIPT

4-ACO-DET

4-ACO-MALT

4-ACO-DPT

4-HO-MET

4-HO-DPT

4-HO-DET

4-HO-EPT


I've got a lot to compare and start writing trip reports for, just need time ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Aquired  gram of this. Pretty stoked, been on my list for a while. From what Ive read this is more similiar to DPT than say, mushrooms, like most 4 subs. DPT plugged is my go to, with stellar results. 50mg plus a disso = OOB or damn near every time. Unfortunatly from the post in this and the 4 ho thread plugging seems about equal to oral effects.


I think I plan on insulfating 50mg with 30mg o-pce plugged. Hopefully the drip/burn isnt enough to irritate the trip. How os the redose factor with this. DPT I can plug smaller amounts 2-3x ending with 50-70mg total with no noticeable loss of potency. When redosing and using multiple chems, I find using dissos and adding in a phen seems to help with quick tolerance. IE, dose 4 aco dpt, hours later dose more 4 aco dpt with 20-30mg 2c-d or 2c-c (for example, and its like the first dose of the night.


Will probably dose the 50/30 I allready mentioned. Have more 4 aco dpt, dpt, 2c-d/c, thj- 081, and o pce on deck to see where the mood takes me. I kind of want to start smaller with 20-30mg 4 aco dpt, but dont want to end up chasing the dragon due to initial low dose. 


Has anyone combined 4 sub dpt with DPT before? Seems like it would be an obvious combo, but cant recall reading about it.


Also, does this one vaporise fine as a HCL, or is a freebase conversion reccomended?.


Thanks!

Haha ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)


I've had 4-HO-DPT, have you yepyep?  I find it similar to the low dose of DPT I've had one time before.  Not sure whether 4-AcO-DPT is substantially different from the hydroxy.  I have more explorations to do with it but so far I have found it mild and intriguing.  I have only dosed it up to 40mg, nasally, and I have found some interestingly subtle yet very present effects.  No hint of ego loss at that dose for me, but that might change at higher dosages.


My guess is you'd want to convert to freebase for vaping, but I've never tried vaping it one way or the other.

Never had 4 ho dpt. Ive gone through at least 2 grams of DPT, always plugging, usually 30-50mg doses.my fave trip was like 200mg + MDMA and 120mg DPT plugged with a lot of MXE. I just sat meditating facing all kinds of crazy/perceivably unpleasant shit and the MDMA just let me be like "okay yah, i can deal with this." DPT to me has a feminine presense. A trickster of sorts. One that loves you but wants to fuck with you to see if you can pull meanong out of pushing your boundaries... If that makes sense. Id like to recreate that with 6 apb maybe, but my experience with 6 apb says I would be better off with MDMA.


I will most likely be giving 4 aco dpt a go tommorrow. If things come up it could be next week. I am pretty excited.


Ooooo. I just thought about like 250mg MDMA (2 doses), 80mg DPT and 20-30mg 2c-e plugged. Holy fuck....


Also, Xorkoth, to be clear you have experimented with 4 ho dpt, but not 4 aco dpt. Correct?

Hopefully tommorrow. Did a 1-2mg allergy bump the other day. Had some o pce and jwh-122, sitting outside I was like "oooo the colors". I swear I felt something DPTish. I wanna do it right now but I am so tired and work in 11 hours. Come on patience!

Like 5mg< vaped jwh122 is a fairly cannabis reminisent high for me.


Man the other night I was gung ho on the 4 aco dpt. Chopped up 50mg on a card. Had 35mg o oce ready to plug. Sniffed 10mg o oce and sat down to meditate and get my mind right. Was so tired I was nodding out and had work in 5.5 hours. Went to bed like a resonsible person. Ugh


That 4 aco dpt is getting done today, tom, or the next. I kinda wanna mix some 6 apb, but will prolly save dor later. Wanna experience 4 aco dpt itself. Maybe add in some DPT or 2c-c/d

#1)


40mg insufflated hcl, after a 20mg orally experiment 24 hours prior (actually, the oral 20 gave threshold effects, surprisingly... ppls faces became very... interesting and less familiar), added to a moderate helping of arylcyclohexylamine (very familiar with the ach state) led to a very strong ego dissolution. almost as if the tryptamine brought out a hole from nowhere near a hole dose of ach. not as visual as mushrooms can most certainly be at this level of inebriation. very disorienting, difficult to focus visually, and somewhat hard to focus tought. 


_________________________  


#2) orally, about triple that (75 ish), plus a very light dose of 2'-oxo-pcm led to a state of the intensity of, say, 3.5g of psilocybe cubensis, or @2-3g of p. ovoideocystidiata. almost felt overwhelmed, but the intro peak led to a nice long cozy plateau. have no data on time, left phone back in civilization. 


at comedown, cannabis brought everything back to peak mental intensity, while muting the vascular discomfort.

unique. almost alien... blank slate, i feel as though i lead the trip, not the other way around. very spacey, feel lazy in mind, amped in extremities. maybe stuff for rolling in bed, but nature walks are very welcome.

experiment #4


haggard ass ghetto ass bicarbonate freebasing of the hcl (10-12 mg), 

heat source: candle


>shot to a +2 over 4 min... +1 after 20, fairly baseline after 40, possibly leftover light stimulation)


want to not-so-ghetto basify and extract... felt dirty, but it may have been the quick shotup (even orally, extremeties get over-stimulatey... like a weird electricity that just doesnt set quite well with my harmonics or something... easy to ignore)


***


all research following a break of @ 1 week, aside from first entry. 


***


one more experiment of 25 mg insufflated led to threshold mental effects, but still some visuals. cannabis smoked soon after peak brought the visuals out, and allowed for strong emotional catharsis over a deep conversation. could be very therapeutic, especially when combined with cannabis, which seems to bring out deep emotion. 


my explanation of "peak": all psychedelic tryptamines, lysergamides, and phenethylamines follow the same basic (proportional) timeline... comeup leads quickly to a noisy peak, which subsides into a lesser intensity plateau over the main 75% of the trip (with its own chaotic peaks and valleys), leading to a gradual decline. 


if you are familiar with digital sound processing, its like a karplus-strong plucked string emulation.


 this compound in particular has a smooth hill for a comeup, and a very quick comedown. 


anyway, 


tl;dr drugs=good

Thanks for that. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  There aren't a lot of reports on this stuff, if you'd like, it would be cool if you posted this in the Trip Reports forum too.

copy/paste as one report? im new to this talking in depth about my trips online thing. 


as a follow-up, id like to add that 4-aco-dpt has a distinctly introspective motor. there is this artistic beauty that settles over everything, and a loss for words. i think the cool colors: cyan, indigo, and a chartreuse edge characterize it well. 


and although i was once on my high horse, skeptical about people calling dpt "the light" (havent tried dpt, but the term sounds kinda cult-y), i will say that with the 4-aco substituted version, i did get sucked into a curiosity adventure via a blinking light, a plane landing with its bright and loudness really took me on another journey, and the stars popped like nothing ever before. not sure if the idea was planted, but there does seem to be a thing about light (only noticed once juxtoposed against the dark black night)


sorry for my wordiness... i am quite fond of this compound. it has a strange beauty, not so far off from my impression of eth-lad.

You can copy/paste as one report, yeah.


I've had 4-HO-DPT a couple of times and I found it strangely light yet powerful, certainly introspective.  Very different from other 4-sub tryptamines.

o yeah, the freebase is most certainly vape style active. 


water solution of 100mg of the hcl + ammonia > coffee filter + water wash left a light tan gunk; an estimated 30-45 mg total vaporized over 2 or 3 minutes led to a very strong +3. could see a visual jungle over the horizon which could easily take over if pushed, both ce and oe galore. 


am almost completely baseline after 2-3 hours. 


would be an easy one to take into oblivion, if not for the peripheral stimulation. the foreign-ness can be a touch unsettling, but is fun to play with. very rewarding on the downhill coast to baseline. 


abdominal muscles tense, even after baseline, and even through a cannabis stone.

I tried this twice at about 50mg snorted each time. Both times with largeish amounts o - pce and once with20mg 2c-d. 50mg was a full on trip for me. 


All I can really say is like... baby DPT. I think I did too much o pce b/c I feel like I blacked out both times but I dunno. I am going to try it again in a few weeks. Maybe with some DPT as well. woooo.

during a recent trial (43 mg snorted) the body load was pretty harsh, but i blame the amplification of an already painful stomach-ache. could definitely take this to oblivion land, (i say this because of the body feeling, ironically, which feels quite serotonergic to my layperson self), but next time, especially if i go much higher, id better make sure im already feeling fine in the g.i. department, may even want to skip eating for many hours prior. 


°°°°

there really is a huge appreciation for all things light and color. no real enhancement, per say (in fact, the visuals are VERY subtle, color-wise), but the enhancement of the appreciation for color, and wonderment for light, is impressive. 


not entirely sure if this is impressed upon my psyche from reading trip reports on the unsubbed dpt, but i will say that my partner brought it up with no prior knowledge of the dpt meme of "the light", and i was highly skeptical to the point of cynicism about the whole " the light" thing, tbh, deliberately not mentioning it to my partner. 


°°°°


anyway, stuck out through the peak, and probably an hour or two of plateau, but ultimately needed a light bowl-pack to help abate the peripheral discomfort. 


another strong bowl of some cindy99 brought out that strong emotion, once again, and the tears came out upon thinking about we humans killing eachother and possibly our entire race. 


all-in-all, i would say this one will probably stay in rotation (if available), even with bodyload taken into account (mostly my fault, anyway, methinks).

Hi Rita for some reason I missed this. I have been collecting data from my experiences and will get these reports on the site ASAP. Got slightly side tracked by the King that is DMT.

**Long**


Decided that after almost 4 weeks of not taking any psychedelics it would be nice to have a trip with just one other person. I traded a small amount of weed for 2 40 milligram doses of 4-AcO-DPT. The doses were wrapped in to layers of toilet paper, so it could be properly contained. In preparation for this trip I along with my girlfriend ( we’ll call her C ) meditated to help calm our minds and find acceptance within ourselves. This helps let go of thoughts and dismiss negative thought loops while tripping for me. I already regularly meditate, but I would say I was definitely doing it for longer periods of time during the days leading up to the trip. Accompanying the preparational meditation was a break from substances besides caffeine and some herbal and vitamin supplements. I chose to go about my life like this, so that the psychedelic substance would have a substantial contrast from what I was used to. 


During the destined day for the experiment I was filled with great anticipation for the experience that was about to unfold. I was expecting a heavy trip with not that intense visuals and minimal vasoconstriction. A few hours before I planned to trip I took 120 milligrams of ginkgo biloba  and 200 milligrams of saint john’s wort. When I arrived at my house, C and I consumed some ginger tea and waited 45 minutes to try and eliminate any potential nausea. Even though I found this technique to be very effective, C still had some nausea for a small amount of time.


I sniffed 40 mgs of 4-AcO-DPT at around 4:16 pm. I can already feel a headspace coming on not even 5 minutes later. I am looking forward to using this chemical for recreation along with therapeutic insight. I am also prepared with becoming closer to my lovely girlfriend. I am starting feel my heart more than I normally would. The music I’m listening to is beginning to feel more drawn out compared to how it was. There is a terrible taste in the back of my throat which is one of the worst physical sensations I have experienced. I did not know what to expect in relation to the drip as this is the first time I have ever snorted a psychedelic. C is complaining of a burning sensation in her nasal cavity, but has yet to experience a drip. 


10 Minutes. In My thoughts are coming at me at slower speeds it feels like. Starting to notice some closed eye visuals. I saw what I imagine to be the back of my head. The drip makes me shiver. Starting to notice a strange tingly sensation in the back of my head. Thoughts have appeared to me that are questioning if it’s a good idea to be tripping and that maybe it was a mistake. I find that I am able to quickly let go over any more detail on that thought and I start to accept what is happening to my brain.


20 minutes in. Feeling very cold, I need to put on more clothes. Starting to notice a lot more visuals. I feel strangely distant from my body like it's getting farther and farther away from me and i’m sinking back into my brain. Having a strange focus on the mental processes that need to happen in order for me to type. When I close my eyes I’m getting flashing lights. C begins to taste the drip and almost throws up from the taste ![:p](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png). She compares it to the taste of beer, which she also dislikes.


24 minutes in. Decided to smoke some weed from my bubbler. The smoke feels warm inside of my lungs and somehow it helps me ignore the drip.


34 minutes. I am experiencing waves of deep thought that precedes thought suppression. It’s hard for me to understand what is going on. After smoking weed C and I decided to wear the two onesies we obtained for an interesting and hilarious time. I was dedicated to fitting my body into a sully from Monsters Inc onesie while C wore a Giraffe Onesie. I think I have smoked enough weed for now as It definitely made the trip stronger and it is still growing a lot. The drip is less noticeable now which is nice as it was getting pretty unbearable at points. 


37 minutes. I feel as if there is multiple opinion forming parts of me each of which has slight alterations to each other I imagine them as my brain cells. It’s hard to remember what to focus on. I am having intense deja vu. Many parts of some conversations feel like they have been said before by me or C. I am getting some very intense visuals now. Still feeling cold. C begins to feel anxious physically, but it is not accompanied by anxiety mentally. 


56 minutes. It’s kinda getting hard to stand. Visuals are extremely intense right now. I feel strangely un emotional. It seems like im thinking with less of a barrier yet a lot of my thoughts are illogical. I feel separate from my emotions and that they are a lot less powerful. Getting a larger amount of visuals in the form of neon green and pink. I saw neon green and pink blobs covering C’s face when I looked at her.


1 hour 39 minutes. I was told to stay in my room and somehow I got the idea that the police were coming for me and I had to hide the substances I had. Eventually I figured out it was just christmas present wrapping and some of the stuff was mine so I couldn’t see.


1 hour 58 minutes. It’s amazing how music can create an atmosphere that you can immerse yourself in. C says the music we’re listening to sounds like monsters inc because it’s jazz and i’m in a sully onesie. it would be really funny to watch monsters inc right now with a really serious perspective, really diving deep into every part of monsters inc. Seriously though I couldn’t imagine being able to understand a movie right now. Humor is really hard to understand right now, but then again everything is really hard to understand right now. It is really easy to look too much into a lot of things. Everything is just exaggerated completely beyond my control. I feel like there is so much in between right and wrong, but when i’m sober I don’t feel like there is much of a difference. I am really starting to like what this chemical is doing to me.


2 hours 15 minutes. It’s very funny to think about how my c is getting confused about how there would only be words on one side of a book. It’s interesting to think about different music puts you in different head spaces. There is a lot of language suppression. Issues are very specific. During a conversation with C, we agreed that gossip is not inherently bad in the sense that you it gives you a lot more things to talk about with others. At least I find it hard to talk about just myself. C is continuing to talk about monsters inc. She says that she feels silly but also serious, and we are both beginning to feel very childlike and innocent. 


2:30. I really like involving myself in Miles Davis’s Relaxin' while in this state of mind.    This album is really a Jazz classic. It’s good to remember that I will still feel happy when i’m not tripping. I find that it is very hard to take in new information in this state of mind, and because of this it allows you to be more present with the present. C thinks that sexual interactions are the last thing on her mind however they still remain slightly. She also is beginning to think deeply into her remaining trauma and believes she is able to forgive and let go of some troubles that we have experienced in our relationship in the past. Things took a turn fast, and now the trip seems therapeutic to her conscious. She has began to analyze her behaviors and determine why she does some negative behaviors while she is sober. 


3 hours. When I breath in sharply I can definitely taste the drip again, but at this point it is barely noticable. C is still thinking intimately about her own personality and her thoughts as whole. She mentions that although she makes questionable decisions sometimes, she feels as if making these mistakes are part of learning, and that she is learning as she goes through life. She also thinks she has been somewhat judgemental lately, and has decided she wants to separate from those harsh judgements she’s placed on herself and others. 


3 hours 20 minutes. I’m listening to The Love Strings of Mort Garson - Love Sounds. This music is very relaxing, and it is easy listening. Mort Garson is an amazing Canadian musician. C also made a playlist for the trip, but I am finding it difficult to listen to because I prefer different genres of music than she is in the mood for currently. She’s agreed to let me play my music. I am starting to come down, at least it feels like I am at some moments. 


3:54. Visuals have started to subside, but the body load and headspace is still very much present. C feels as if it is harder to focus on visual hallucinations, and instead can focus on auditory warping. Hunger is bearable, but worsening quickly. C and I decide to watch The Office and grab some food. Eating is a weird sensation, but I enjoy it more when I am tripping. 


4:30. We are still tripping, but open eye visuals have mostly disappeared for C. We have decided to watch a movie called “memento”. For some reason, both C and I are able to comprehend the movie better than the first time we watched it while sober. Would recommend for tripping, though maybe it is better to watch during the comedown than at the peak. C agrees that watching a movie during the peak could be a waste of a psychedelic experience. 


5 hours in. Trip has mostly ended other than some discomfort from vasoconstriction for C. The trip definitely is less gradual taken internally compared to orally, but honestly that is not a bad thing at all. C is beginning to feel quite sleepy, and I think I agree with her. Memory has been suppressed a lot at this point, and I feel slightly confused by all concepts introduced to me. My mom is entertained by our onesies, and we enjoy being the subject of her humor at this point. Being in a onesie is beginning to feel uncomfortable, so I think I will strip myself of it and wear normal clothes now. C has already changed into some shorts and her turtleneck. She looks pretty goofy. 


5:30. I feel good for the trip that has is ending. There is an overall sense of a clear and optimistic mindset. I feel as though I achieved my goal of becoming closer to C during this experience. We have agreed to combine our trip reports into one. Almost becoming one thing entirely. 


Morning After. I was able to get a good night’s sleep after the trip, and I woke up feeling particularly energized and healthy. C began to feel fatigued and blamed it on an emerging head cold. We decided to take the dog for a 3 hour walk.


The next day/night. C and I have just returned from our walk. I am getting some HPPD/flashbacks to the trip from last night. During the walk, we were able to talk more than usual, and we seem to get along more as well. Confusion and miscommunication are slightly present, but it is easy to dismiss. During the walk, we meditated while taking short breaks from walking around, and surprisingly neither of us got tired though we were gone for hours. Colors are more vibrant than usual, and christmas lights are more entertaining to observe than most days. There is a stronger connection between C and I, so the goal of our trip was succeeded. 


Overall, I would recommend the chemical to anyone as long as they are in the right headspace. It was surprisingly euphoric with a very interesting headspace. I advise on taking some L-Arginine or something for vasoconstriction as it got pretty bad at some points.  Even though I only tried this chemical once it is already one of my favorite RC’s. 

My experience: 2C-B, 4-AcO-DMT, 4-HO-MET, Moxy, AL-LAD, LSD.

Just acquired a decent amount of 4-AcO-DPT from a well known Canadian vendor that's about to shut down...its a tan colour and has a very strong acetic acid odour...has anyone else noticed a strong vinegar odour with their 4-AcO-DPT??

I would imagine intranasal administration would not be pleasant because of the vinegar smell....maybe rectal  ROA only???

Rectal ROA worked amazingly well with 4-HO-DPT as a suspension in 1ml of vodka...

Are you certain 4-AcO-DPT is totally ineffective recatally?

Some drugs are just wayyyyyy better revtally like MXE.

4-ho-dpt administered rectally via a 1 mil oral syringe dissolved in 1 mil vodka provided one of 're most visually intense trios I've ever had with an almost immediate onset. 

Couldn't even see my hands in  front of me the visuals were so intense at the peak.

I didn't have to worry about nasal drip, having to taste the chemical or whatever and 1ml of solution absorbs very very quickly recatally and dosage is roughly the same as nasal. 

I would not recommend this ROA with any substance that you could easily overdose on though....in my experience rectal ROA is a bit more intense than nasal ROA.

I tried this at 25mg oral last night on an empty stomach. I felt the first effects after 15-20 minutes and after 30 minutes or so started to get some nervous twitches in my legs, mainly around my hamstrings. It felt like trapped energy getting released and shaking itself out through my legs. I felt some slight nausea which made me cough a little bit like something wanted to come up, but it never did. Apart from the physical effects, it made me feel super alert and there seemed to be an enhancement to the room's lighting effects, where anything that was reflecting light stood out more than anything else.


After the first hour, the physical effects went away. I felt really tuned in at this point. It made everything I tried to do seem so simple and effortless. The little guy in my head was in a good mood and enjoying the clarity of mental/physical harmony. I started vaping marijuana at this point per my usual nightly routine. Shortly after that, I ate a couple tacos which went down normally.


Overall the effects lasted about 4-5 hours and I had no trouble going to sleep after that. I never really got any visuals from it apart from the cool lighting effects, but my vision was super crisp. The marijuana clouded my head a bit but I had become super clear headed from the 4-AcO-DPT. I could tell when I was starting to smoke too much and was aware of how the marijuana was affecting my mental state because the tryptamine had such a strong clarity about itself on my mind. Because of that, I think this is a great tryptamine for low and micro doses. I'm not sure if I would consider 25mg low, however.


Compared to 4-HO-DPT, this one seemed to be more potent orally for me. I'll try it again at 50mg and see how it compares, but I've enjoyed the 4-AcO tryptamines more so than the 4-HO in what I've been able to research so far. They feel more natural to me. I see 4-HO-DPT being referred to as Psiprocin, does that make this one Psipracetin? I'm glad I was able to test it out.


4-AcO-DMT has been regarded as "oral DMT" and so it is encouraging to think of this one as "oral DPT". I've yet to have a great experience yet with DPT, but I think 4-AcO-DPT has a place in medicine. I didn't really get a recreational vibe from it at all. I'm judging that on how well I was able to focus on and follow along with what was happening around me. I suffer from (self-diagnosed) ADD and usually find it hard to follow a story on TV, for example, because my mind is always wandering. This chemical practically eliminated that mindless wandering.

I tried this orally on new years eve on the tail end of a 1p-eth-lad trip...

Tried 200mg orally which was very very visually intense yet mentally I just felt like I was even clearer headed than being sober...like my mind was plugged into a higher intelligence.

The visuals were soooooo unique, consisting of slivers, holds, neon purples, magenta, etc.

It came on suddenly with zero body load just suddenly 30 mins after swallowing it the visuals ramped up 100 fold. 

This is hands down my all time favourite psychedelic...i just kept thinking the whole time thst this chemical is all I've been searching for in my lifelong adventure into psychedelics.

This stuff is absolutley extrordinary!!!

Haha, I bet. The 25mg I took was enough to know there is something special about this one. When I took it, I wanted to describe the feeling as superconscious. I don't remember ever being so clear headed.

I'll be trying more of this soon at different doses, but can already say it's going to be one of my favorites, if it doesn't take first.

Tried this again at 50mg oral. I didn't mix it with marijuana this time. The effects were similar to my 25mg dose just a bit more intense. From T+15min - T+1hr I felt like my body was taking off like a rocket. I've done work with reiki and other energy therapies in the past and this reminded me of that. It raises my vibration to a higher frequency.


After the first hour the physical effects go away and I feel a great sense of clarity and peace. I almost went back to feeling "normal" at this point but felt like a better version of myself.


I believe this and psilacetin are great spiritual tools. I'd like to continue doing research with both as they are very interesting from an energetic perspective. Psilacetin seems to work to rebalance the energy centers within my body, while psipracetin works to raise my vibration and connect me to my higher self.


I may be trying a combo of the two in the near future...

@tacodude


not a lot of info out on this compound yet; the dosages seem to be all over the place, and even the same dose from one trip to another (same person) can have varying effects. 


i would recommend starting under 10mg. insufflated, ime, is anywhere between 10-50mg, but people have pushed it a bit.

I see people saying 80+ mg is where people usually start finding use out of it although my only guess that would explain that is they had the 4-ho variation vs 4-aco. I was thinking that area if not lower... I just wish there was a good idea of mg/kg dosage estimation

I took 25mg 4-AcO-DMT and 25mg 4-AcO-DPT in gel caps.


The psilacetin kicked in first. I still got typical yawns and watery eyes but was less sedated than I normally am taking psilacetin alone. The visuals from the psilacetin had a backlight. Normally psilacetin is a bit dark but this time it was enhanced with light from the psipracetin. It sometimes looked like shattered stained glass with a bright light behind it.


Mentally it was entertaining. The psipracetin really shines through at this level. I felt like there was a ghost dancing around in my head and playing tricks on me. It had precognition and would say random things to me that synced up with words and phrases that were being said on TV, but about entirely different subjects. It felt like there was a devil and angel on my shoulders at times; this also coming from the dark/light differences in the two chemicals.


It did keep a big grin on my face throughout most of it. I vaped some marijuana during the trip which helped intensify the effects. After 4 hours or so I started coming down and may have been able to sleep. I decided instead to smoke the DPT infused herb I made earlier in the day which brought on another peak and kept things interesting for another few hours.


I would try this again with maybe 35mg 4-AcO-DMT and 65mg 4-AcO-DPT.

It would be helpful to get more experiences and info about this one. I don't know about IV but orally it's pretty active at 25mg for me. My SO takes it orally at 12-15mg and that's a good experience for her. I'll probably try somewhere around 10mg myself soon. It has a great cognitive illumination that should still be present at that dose.

why is it called "psipracetin" instead of "propacetin" or something along those lines?


im much more comfortable with the (4-xx)-tryptamine naming convention anyway, but "psipracetin" is so confusing that i wanted to ask...

I'm not sure, I suppose we would have to know why 4-HO-DPT was named psiprocin in the psychonaut wiki. To me, just looks like a substition of "l" with "pr" in the following ("methy**l**" to "**pr**opyl"?):


4-HO-DMT = psilocin

4-HO-DPT = psiprocin

4-AcO-DMT = psilacetin

4-AcO-DPT = psipracetin


There are some notes on the nomenclature here, though it doesn't list DPT:

First let me correct something


Lace=Acetyl DMT


Now let's compare the 4 & 5 position ho dmt

Psilocin

Cebilcin (imo should be Cebilocin)


Psi vs Cebi while the Lo-L and in match closest. My best guess


Psi=4th attachment

Cebi= 5th attachment


Lo/L=Ho attachment


in=Tryptamine


At least that's the best way I could see it

Well I've come down enough after about an hour or two of IVing ≈<9 as this stuff is a pain to dissolve as people have said. Back loading it into a syringe and then just filling it with water while pulling back blood before pushing back down again although this doesn't seem viable for amounts 10mg<.


The come up was actually very intense physically with a lot of tension like MDMA jaw tension somewhat throughout the body. The visuals seem to really mess with depth perception and create rainbow trails creating a rainbow depth to everything. Besides those noticable differences I could say it was very similar to 4-aco-dmt although those differences can make it an excruciating trip for someone not experienced.


Maybe a couple other differences to note the colors seem to be on a green red gradient vs an orange red gradient 4-aco-dmt gives. There was also a bit more distortion of tactile sensation were my right arm felt like my left because it was on my left side, which I can only compare to something I experienced on mushrooms my first time.


Curious how this will work out other ROA, but there's no way in hell orally anyone sould need more than 20 mg. Oral BA would have to be 10%-30% and I highly doubt that's the case. It may not be as strong as the come up effects I had, but it should be quite potent.

Hmmm, sounds interesting Tacodude. I liked 4 aco DMT via the IV route, it was very intense at about 25 mgs for me. The comeup was somewhat overwhelming, and I found I can get the same experience with a more comfortable come up by using it IM and increasing the dose. I really enjoy visuals, the more swirling and crazy the better, so your 4 aco dpt report intrigues me.


Have u tried plain old DPT? How did the 4 aco version compare?

Never tried any other Tryptamine analog besides 4-aco-dmt before this. It was really interesting and I'd honestly have to test it more. It's definitely going to a personal stash. The only problem is that it doesn't dissolve well and 0.05 ml at most of isopropyl, which no one should do. It might've been why the onset was so intense physically, but I don't think it was just that as it came and went with the trip not on its own. I'm going to have to try it again with a better choice of solution, but I'm not in a rush to try that one again xD


I could see adding a few mg of it to a shot of 4-aco-dmt just be overwhelming. It was almost overwhelming on its own. Like I was trying to pack a bowl and was wondering if the cannabis was alive and how fucked up it would be if it was burning alive screaming when we smoke it.... I damn near couldn't smoke my weed. It's a good thing I got a good grip on my shit. I came out the trip thinking everything is perfect..... Except for Donald Trump

I had no problem dissolving 4 aco DMT in plain old sterile water from the needle exchange. I just added the powder too the steri-cup added about 0.5 mls of water and used a bic lighter to gently heat it. Not boil, just warmed the water which easily went into solution with a little stir. I hope the DPT Hcl I have on the way dissolves ok. 


But, I would really like to try 4 aco dpt now.

Most tryptamine salts are quite soluble, I believe DPT HCl is too.  4-HO/AcO-DPT seem(s) to be an exception.

I think DPT is soluble, which is weird as I'd assume an acetylated form of it would be more soluble. The 4-aco-dpt I'd recommend trying, but take it slow as the physical tension was intense.

Plain DPT is very water soluble. There's most likely some reason the 4-HO or AcO isn't. Chemistry is not always totally linear. You can expect that things should be a certain way given its predecessors were but that doesn't always make it so...

Yea I wish I could understand the science..... Anywho


My conclusion on this compounds about ROA? Oral dosing is pretty much useless and would require a large dose. Nasally is possible to be useful, but again pretty weak. IV and probably IM it's the way to go with this compound bringing out the visual nature of the compound.


As far as doses attempted:

Oral 20 mg with 10 mg 4-aco-dmt twice Nasal 10-15 mg twice

IV <10 mg twice

I actually have a theory what's going on with this compound. I think 4-aco-dpt has its own activity, but unless injected it converts to 4-ho-dpt, which requires a much higher dose as the only time I've gotten effect was via IV and it wears off extremely fast within the hour, but is always very strong.


I very much enjoy it and wish I could extend the effect as the description of a fiendish tryptamine is actually quite a good description.

@tacodude


I'm surprised you're not getting much from oral ROA. It does seem to me that tolerance lasts a bit longer on this one compared to 4-AcO-DMT. So if you took the 20mg oral a couple of days after your IV dose it makes sense to me that you didn't get much from it.


I've taken this at 10mg oral a couple times now during the week when I would have a bit of a tolerance yet from the previous weekend. I still find it useful at that dose. For example, it gave me enough of a mental boost to get some computer work done later in the evening one day. It lasted a couple hours and I didn't have any trouble sleeping after that. I wouldn't expect to trip at that dose though.


Try taking a week off then try like 35-40mg oral and see how that compares to your IV dose.

I don't have much of it and nothing has come even close to the IV dose.... Like I don't even feel it. Yet IV besides the first dose has been mostly pretty effective. I'm planning on ordering some caapi extract to use with it next time

I had some thoughts in retrospective and so subjectively concluded this one, best described as dissociative Psychedelic, my all-time-favorite in it?s class!


I?d say it?s definitely (in contrast to, let?s say,4-AcO-DMT) more on the lighter side of things but at the very same time all-encompassing - a Gem of sparkling magic and a very own unique nature, years after use still in mind to a degree to be as out-of-the-ordinary just as only MXE seems to be...


A real winner!

We had a very informative trial with this chemical on good Friday...6 of us trialed tgis at varying dosages from 20mg up to 300mg for myself and my roommate  ( who is very very seasoned hatdhead when it comes to psychedelics ( we both trialed this at 200mg on new years with no problems).

This is a word of warning for anyone even thinking about attempting a dose over 150mg... my tripping partner had a serious freak out where she was convinced that everyone had overdosed and was going to die but that we were too high to realize this. 

In reality, everybody was fine with no one showing any signs of toxicity or physical side effects whatsoever. My tripping partner became hysterical screaming that we should call 911..it took 2mg of etizolam and about 30 mins of reassurance that everybody was just fine and thst it was all in her head.

I took the same amount and had no problems and was even able to figure the situation while tripping balls.

I also have to say that at higher dosages this stuff has A LOT of similarities to MXE. 

This is by far the most dissociative tryptamine I've tried. Also, just like with MXE, the come down is extremely euphoric and leaves you feeling extrordinarly awesome. Most psychedelics make me want to have a shower after the trip to wash of the "chemical sweats")  that I usually get from mushrooms or LSD.

I kept saying at the end if the evening that this stuff makes me feel like my body and brain have etched with s laser beam...just felt crisp, clean, powerful, and balanced which I've never experienced on the cone down on anything except MXE.

This stuff is extrordinary...beyond extrordinary even. In my opinion about 60mg orally is equivalent to about 100mcg of 1P-LSD.

This is very serious psychedelic and needs to be handled with the highest respect. I've never experienced any greater psychedlic in my entire life.

This stuff really can take the mind to strange places and yes it causes distortion to an extreme degree. Extreme melting, bleeding, and color morphing. It's not one to be taken lightly


Again if I can get extremely powerful effects with just 10 mg IV I can't imagine those high doses. Like it's one that kicks my ass every time.


Start low with this one and titrate up. If you want to make sure you feel it try injecting 10 mg although it wears off very fast this method. I assume larger oral doses last longer

A dose of 300mg lasted about 8 hours.

It was visually overwhelming and I couldn't watch the movie (annihilation) that we had put on...just visuals so intense I couldn't see the remote control never mind trying to make out what's going on the tv.

At 300mg my thought process was very dissociated similarly to how my brown thinks on MXE. Very difficult to retain any track of thought, I kept forgetting what I was just talking about. I'm extremely curious how a smaller dose of this would be combined with MXE....

I just to add took 4/5 doses via the IR-Route (intrarectally), which seems more fast-acting, cost-effective and not as nasty as some untasty chems are beyond usual levels, like the nightmare of intranasal K, i.e. maximal levels redefining what sour is besides a load of crystalline shards stuffed up the nose, beyond what?s a grasp of thought of least possible well-being when a near-death experiment is the plan!


So a not too bad reduction as usual and proven to be wrong kinda bioavailability, less bang for your buck but cool enough for the privileges of ego-loss in the depths of K-Hole... This being said, in fact what?s the point actually applies even more so to the unholy disgusting whatever-the-hell of ?taste? and ?smell? accompanies the out-of-all-bounds evil and vile hell of what it?s infamous for: DPT, also not too easy to be found said to be ?dark? psychdelia and what?s like heading into that with a constant urge to projectile vomit, big-time? 


Just to remind that both work better as said to be and are subjective two ?plug-only? candidates, only and know other routes, i shut you not!

Are you talking about 4-aco-dpt? How did you get it into a solution for plugging. I guess it makes sense as it's not like IV that requires a small needle to pass through.... Did it absorb well? I found IV was the only way to make 10 mg active and only for a couple hours at best.

Very interesting that you found yours to be not very soluble in isopropyl alcohol ...i found it to be quite soluble in both isopropanol and ethanol.

In fact I usually use isopropyl alcohol wipes to clean up any spilled powder and it soaked up like water to a sponge. 

Also, it's way safer to put vodka up your butt than isopropyl alcohol.

I'm guessing we both have the same fumrate form? I'm confident mine is the right compound especially with it's distinctive effect I've come to love. Most people report problems with solubility when it comes to this compound. I did only add 0.05 ml to a water solition, but the 10 mg should've dissolved.


Again though it's not like I will inject alcohol. I am curious how well it dissolves in Polyethylene glycol, but I don't have any to test it with.

Withba bit of heat and agitation...i was able to get 100mg into 2ml everclear for rectal administration. It's very important to to have a full and proper bowel movement before rectal administration. I've had zero success when I've not totally emptied my bowels before hand.

Bit it 100% works and hits you like s ton of bricks when done properly.

I meant 4-AcO/HO-DPT, yes - both were readily soluble in plain tap water. I remember it was the fumarate, but as it’s a few years ago I am not 100% sure of that. I believe I dosed up to 35mgs and even those were put into at most 3ml of water and dissolved just fine.

Are you sure it was the aco version soluble in water? As most places report insoluble as my experience shows. It may suspend in 1 ml of water, but it crashes right back down to the bottom. Heating may help a bit, but it seems to just get it to stick to the metal cooker I use.

Good to know about the ethonal although it did not seem to be too soluble in isopropyl... Do you think like 0.05 ml of ethonal would be enough to dissolve 20-30 mg? Also did you try PEG?

It goes into pure ethanol pretty easily with the last bits requiring small amounts of agitation and careful heat.

I am unsure, as said, since it?s been awhile fumbling around with the 4-subbed Tryptamines. It?s possible that i just plugged the HO-Variant, because i know I preferred this one and just had very few times testing the AcO to see what?s the difference - faster onset and a wee bit more potent, as the general consensus goes!

Most people say there's little difference between the two except solubility it seems... Although I can't get the HO. Guess I'll have to try with ethonal, but I hate the idea if injecting ethonal especially when I'll likely have to use a 40% vodka

I'm pretty sure injecting alcohol is a terrible idea...i would say 4-AcO-DPT is just not meant to be taken by needle.

It works just fine orally and rectally.

If diluted 1:4 alcohol:water I can probably get away with it once... I know  (0.2 ml at most to 0.8 preferably 0.05:0.95 ml:ml if I can).


There's even a study suggesting iv ethonal in place of benzos for alcohol withdrawal.

Also don't judge what you don't know. IV 4-aco-dpt is phenomenal and with 4-aco-dmt it will bring one into hyperspace (5 mg 4-aco-dmt+10 mg 4-aco-dpt pretty much did for me).


 Even if 4-aco-dpt works orally or nasally, which is hasn't for me, I'd prefer IV due to the low dose needed and the intense effect without going into any overwhelming out of body experience just such extreme body euphoria with spasms that aren't the most comfortable yet don't take away from the experience.

Makes sense to me too. But I've spoken to someone that IVs psychedelics and he said that this was the first 4-AcO-XXX he could not get to dissolve. It was the fumarate, maybe the HCl salt is more soluble. 


Lovely stuff. I remember reading about it in Tihkal, and it was but a mention. IMO it certainly deserves it's own entry.

Hmm, I've only tried 4-HO-DPT, but every time I've tried it, it was VERY difficult to get to dissolve in water.  It's the fumarate.  Maybe the HCl salt is more readily soluble and it was what was available a number of years ago when it first made the rounds?  But there are old posts about it being very difficult to dissolve too.

How about 4-AcO-DiPT? Not that I've seen that unicorn for years now. I've spoken to several labs and they all say while they can produce all the other 4-AcO's under the sun, they can't do 4-AcO-DiPT. And it's not a precursor issue (well it might be but I've been told by 3 labs that it's really unstable, which I don't get why). I've been dying to get my hands on it forever. 


How about 4-AcO-EPT/MPT do they have similar solubility issues?

4-HO-MPT fumarate dissolved fine in water for me.  I haven't tried 4-AcO-MPT, nor 4-AcO-DPT, but I can attest to the fact that 4-HO-DPT fumarate is barely soluble in water.  A friend and I decided we wanted to try to IM it.  I took 3mL of water and put in I think 40mg, and stirred and stirred and stirred, for like 15 minutes, with absolutely no water color change or appearance of it having dissolved, it was still floating mostly though some had sunk.  Then we tried heating it over a flame and stirring.  Eventually got the water to very slightly change color and my friend said fuck it and filtered it and IMed it.  I ended up snorting some.  Later on I dried out the undissolved powder and weighed it and we had gotten only 5mg into solution.  Some water evaporated from the heat and IIRC about 1mL was left for that 5mg.

Must be the 2 propyl groups then. It makes sense that the 4-HO would be more soluble. You could try taking off the 4-AcO and getting 4-AcO-DPT. A little citric acid or some kind of acidic buffer maybe? I know very little about IM/IV'ing solubility issues.

You're funny rabbit you say something about the Propyl groups like you understand what the issue is then recommending adding citric acid to make the fumrate salted form more soluble.... One would have to freebase the 4-aco-dpt before trying to convert it to the citrate form in hopes it is a more soluble salt.

I can't remember with certainty but there can be deacetylation through basic and acid conditions. It's been awhile, but I'm pretty sure that's the case. I think I was just talking about 2 subjects at once without differentiating them.

So I found using a 28 guage needle can pull suspended 4-aco-dpt through a lot better than the 30 guage I was using.


I just have to say it's probably a good thing that the CIA did not look into this compound under MK-Ultra as it could be used as a tool to force susceptibility to hypnosis as it doesn't take away from ones awareness or ability to focus on what they are doing, it creates a huge sense of confusion where if someone was just speaking to someone tripping they could easily accept what they are hearing as their own thoughts, and the reason this would work best is because it creates this amazingly intense feeling of physical pleasure like all over to the point it's hard to focus on anything except how amazing ones body feels bring forced to just give in as it can get impossible to disagree not only because one can't focus, but because that intense physical pleasure can cause one to do anything to feel it.


That being said I think this compound would make an amazing tool to utalize for hypnotherapy in a way I wouldn't consider any other to be useful for the same reasons or even close to the same level of usefulness. This was only a 30-60 minute IV experience too... I couldn't even imagine if one was experiencing the effect for multiple hours while being hyonotized it would be near impossible not to give in if the hypnotist knew what they were doing. I definitely plan to experiment as I'm trying to get into there local hypnosis community.

I was fortunate to get a gram of this for a great price and I finally had the opportunity to try some 2 days ago. 


I started with 25mg intranasally which didn't really burn that bad and was a little bitter in my sinuses but nothing that was too extreme. I lightly snorted 25mg at 8PM, took a shower just to waste some time on the come-up and by roughly 9PM I was in a really calm and relaxed state of mind. The most I noticed visually was VERY slight color saturation and when I stared across my bedroom at the sheets on my bed my visual field was trying to start being wavy and like looking through a veil. Barely noticeable except for my improved mood, a light (+). I played Dark Souls until about 12AM and was easily able to fall asleep by 12:30AM. 


I'm excited to try some more soon.

IME 4-AcO-DPT is better than it's HO counterpart - Acetoxy one offers more euphoric feeling with considerably less body load and chest pain. But the pain still comes in as sharp and unpleasant and thats the reason why I dont want to bother getting more of it. 


Used snorting technique, ranging 30-50mg, probably not enough for full blown effects but there was definite ++. 4-AcO-DPT also tastes a lot better than 4-HO one and easier to snort.


I'd try it IM but need to get the right equipment for it.

I highly advise against IM as it's not water soluble really... I've gotten 10 mg or so suspended in solutions I've injected, but there was one time I back loaded it without being concerned how it was somewhat suspendedI planned to draw enough blood to dissolve it, but it didn't even seem to dissolve in the blood in the rig and jammed. It's a very finiky compound, but it is amazing when it works.

Yeah you're right, the 25mg dose I took was me playing it safe and making sure I wasn't overly sensitive. Next time I thought I might take 50mg orally and snort 50mg but I still haven't entirely made up my mind. I have a bit of harmala extract that I was considering smoking during the peak.

My typical normal dose on this is 50mg oral. It hasn't been enough to get into ++++ territory, but one time I got some pretty crazy visuals and headspace on that dose. Felt like I was falling backward through some sort of psychedelic tunnel and couldn't find my way out.


I use this one mainly because I feel like it connects me to a higher intelligence, at any dose I take (down to 10mg oral). I think I'm particularly sensitive to it though.


Highest I've gone so far is 65mg, and I remember feeling that was getting close to my comfort level of physical symptoms, such as tightness in my chest and heavy breathing. I've been thinking about going up to 75mg here soon, just to see if the physical discomfort manifests again, and also if the psychedelic effects change. If that goes well, I'll try 100mg.

I have only gotten effect injecting it, but haven't gone past 20 mg due to limited supply. The most intense physical effects I had was feeling extremely cold with some twitching/spasms going on, but no real discomfort to speak of just not comfortable at that level where it's usually amazing physically. I just wish I had an injectable solvent that the compound was soluble in unlike water....

So earlier instead of eating 50mg and snorting 50mg I tried to snort it all because of how full my stomach was. I could only make it through about ~60mg before it was too much for my nose... I always divide up what I snort in each nostril but right away my right nostril got extremely stuffy to where it was hard to breathe. What was in the other nostril felt like it was just sitting in there all down to my throat, not really making me sick or nauseous but just uncomfortable and unable to really enjoy anything. The effects aren't much to report on, I mainly feel it more in my muscles in a somewhat uncomfortable way that makes me want to writhe around. I think snorting it and it being gross kind of influenced that this trip though. 


Nothing new to add that we didn't already know but I just wanted to share my experience regardless. I think I'm gonna eat it all next time around.

I think the ++++ is going to take more than 50 mg. And well, that special set of circumstances that make a ++++


My first time was with 40 mg and it was lovely. There's a vendor that's selling 4-AcO-XXX sample packs, simple tryptamine packs and 5-meo-XXX freeebase sample packs. I've found that that 4-AcO-MPT, MET and ALL the 5-MeO-XXX freebases to be really interesting.

I bet we go to the same vendor... I used my logic to figure it out.


That being said I think for anyone experienced this compound will take 50+ mg if not 100+ mg. Those who don't have much experience or are very sensitive may get effect from 20 mg.


I think metabolism plays a huge role as when I inject whatever of the 10 mg I can mix into a solution to inject I get this powerful subtle build that becomes overwhelmingly strong with more the air melting, shimmering, and morphing rather than surfaces breathing, changing texture, and rarely color that mushrooms or 4-aco-dmt produce that I actually think is probably the most amazing and powerful effect that doesn't remove one from their environment yet is very short lived.


It leads to a heavy craving and redosing every hour or so to get that intense first wave until it last more than 30 minutes and with it being very very hard to mix in any solution this is actually one of my favorites now, but I just wish I had more and a way to dissolve it better for IV use... Or a good way to use it orally. I believe the key might be harmala alkaloids like oral DMT. There is also the possibly it smokes well, but the only availability is the fumrate salt and unless I had an extra gram that I could risk losing some freebasing it. Plus it might be like DPT and require a good 50-100 mg in one hit, which would require making infused herb. I'd experiment with this stuff if I wasn't planning on leaving this planet next week

Yesterday I took 120mg of harmala extract and 100mg of 4-ACO-DPT and it was a little hard to describe. While I was inside I didn't really have many visuals but when I went outside things started looking really interesting. It didn't have the too much kaleidoscopic effects but when I stared across the yard into the woods and trees I could see unique patterns start to form. I had a bit of muscle twitching during the peak which made me wanna stretch around while laying in bed.

That's already what I'd consider threshold to an active dose and even with the harmala alkaloids it didn't do much? So much for my theory

I feel like they did help a bit but not as much as I expected. It might be important to mention that I seem to be able to take a lot of the ACO variants, like for example my go to 4-ACO-MET dosage is 50+ mg and 25mg of 4-ACO-DET didn't really do that much to me and I feel asleep within an hour. It was a brown oxidized type so maybe that had something to do with the DET. A few weeks ago 25mg of 4-HO-MIPT didn't make me trip as hard as I expected either... not sure what's going on.

Maybe once or twice a month, nothing like I did a few years ago. I try to be mindful of the "needed dose regarding psychedelic tolerance" graph.

Glad I got to try this a few times. I forget my doses, prolly 30-70mg sniffed. Combining with DPT and a disso was nuts!!!!

I only have a few messages left in my PM storage. I want to clear some out, and literally 2 or 3 of the people I was messaging are dead allready. It's like I cant even go in there and delete shit right now. There's got to be a better fucking way.

I picked up a gram of this chemical about a year ago and only remembered I had it recently. I haven't used many psychedelics in the last year except a few small lines of DPT, and nothing over the last few weeks, so I did not have a tolerance. After a few 20 mg test runs (all ROA oral with modest effects), I took 40 mg sublingually, waiting patiently about 10 minutes for it to soak in before drinking something. The taste is not too bad compared to many other things, and the waiting was tolerable. 

Onset time was  about 15 minutes, which progressed to peak effects at about an hour, and baseline at about 3 hrs. It is very hard to describe this chemical; as others have said, it is very unusual, and if I didn't know it was a tryptamine from a trusted source, I would wonder if someone switched it out with something else. It is not stimulating at all, in fact, I felt sleepy during the whole experience. There was not much going on visually, though edges of objects where shimmering and my vision seemed more crisp and colorful than usual. Over the first hour, I felt some muscle cramping in my abdomen and felt a little shackey, but that passed within the first half hour. Mentally I was spaced out but could think very quickly. I was watching a movie with my wife, and in spite of being very stoned (cannabis), I was following everything and even pointing out subtle details of the plot line that my usual stoned self would have missed. In this way, it is like a nootropic. I also felt very content and, unlike DPT, did not have any anxiety. My skin and body felt alive; this molecule is very tactile. It caused a milder "vibrating" effect that I get with DPT at higher doses. The comedown was non-existent, and I was able to sleep after the experience with no chemical assistance. 

I am very encouraged by my initial trial run and plan to increase the dose. I wanted to inject some a few months back but could not get it into solution. From what I have read here and on other forums, this is where it really shines. However, sublingual seems to work as well, so I'll probably stick with that ROA for further trials. I cannot wait to combine this with MXE....

Just received half a gram of this one. It's the HCL salt (anyone knows why this 4-sub is made in HCL when all the others are fumarate ?). I just took 10 mg oral to get an idea of the potency. The reports seemed mixed on the matter of oral activity for this one so I decided to test that ROA first to see for myself.


- Edit : T- 2:00 : It is much more potent than some reports had led me to believe. I was feeling the 10 mg oral lightly and decided to redose 10 nasal and 10 rectal. Kicked my ass. Had to take a benzo as I was not expecting effects this strong in the middle of the day. Also had no problem whatsoever dissolving it in solution. So the people reporting dosages of 100 mg and it not dissolving in water must have had a bunk batch.

Wow that's so interesting. I only know of 1 place that has HCL and that's where I got mine. I never tried dissolving it in water but I might try with a few milligrams, I'm curious now.

We probably have the same source. HCL and surprisingly cheap. Anyway, my first trial was promising. It has the same atypical style of visuals as 4-HO-EPT ( with stuff jumping around in the field of vision ) but much more colorful. Will soon do a proper trial with a larger dose insufflated, or rectal. The ideal would have been subQ injection but I don't know if I have the motivation to go get some needles just for this. Will see. Something like 30-40 mg could do the trick with one of these routes. On the other hand I would like to evaluate oral activity as I feel it has more than expected but I fear wasting material this way.
