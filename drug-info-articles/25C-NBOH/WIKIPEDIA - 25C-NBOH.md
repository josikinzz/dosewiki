25-C-NBOH (2C-C-NBOH, NBOH-2CC) is a derivative of the phenethylamine derived hallucinogen 2C-C which has been sold as a designer drug. It has similar serotonin receptor affinity to the better-known compound 25C-NBOMe.

## Analogues and derivatives

## Analytical chemistry

25C-NBOH undergoes degradation under routine Gas Chromatography (GC) conditions, as well as other NBOH's substances, into 2C-C. An alternative method proposed for reliable identification of 25I-NBOH using GC/MS may be used for 25C-NBOH analysis.

## Legality

### United Kingdom

This substance is a Class A drug in the United Kingdom as a result of the N-benzylphenethylamine catch-all clause in the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971.
