# DOM
*Source: https://thedrugclassroom.com/video/dom/*

DOM is a psychedelic with strong stimulant qualities that has been used since the late 1960s. However, between the 1970s and 1990s, it was almost never used.

The drug, which is also known as STP, has a relatively intense body high that can manifest as a feeling of energy and tingling through the body. Because it’s a more stimulating psychedelic, it lends itself to physical activities.

It may take a long time to begin working, which means you should avoid redosing anywhere near your initial administration. It’d be wise to avoid considering an extra dose for at least 4-5 hours.

DOM hasn’t caused death even with doses over 20-30 mg, but that doesn’t mean those doses can be regarded as safe. While common doses do appear relatively safe for healthy people, you should minimize your use due to the lack of information.
