I'm sure there must be some threads on this somewhere but I've been unable to find them as they're drowned out in the search by threads on 5-Meo-DALT. Can someone point me to some info about this? or give any first hand experiences with it


By the way, haven't managed to find anything on Erowid either.

Your right, I skimmed through the well put together "psychedelic index" and DALT is nowhere to be found. Has this chem not been released to the public until now? I too have seen a well known canadian vendor stock this. If that's the case then don't expect much info for a cool while.


Edit: isn't this one UK legal as well? There aren't many good psychedelics available legally in the UK so this one may be of interest.

I think it's UK legal, it's not mentioned in Tihkal which is where the UK government went for a list of things to ban, but beyond that I don't know.

It is available at a well known dutch vendor.


I wonder how it compares to DPT, as I think 4-HO/AcO-DPT is very similar to 4-HO/AcO-DALT...

5-meo-dalt, to me was like a 5-meo-dipt without any balls or duration.

I have a feeling that dalt on it's own would be a bit more like MET just once again without any true balls or duration.


I could speculate that for seasoned psychedelic trippers dalt would be a mixture between a placebo and mushroom high.

Unless a ludicrous dose was imbibed.

Since we're speculating I'm gonna go out on a short limb and say IM is going to be the best ROA to go with as is the case with most simple tryptamines.

**DALT (N,N-Diallyltryptamine)**


This is apparently being offered currently. No substitution. Just DALT. I can't find much on this compound. Has anybody tried it? Here's a snippet from [the 5-MeO-DALT thread](https://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads/146249-The-Big-amp-Dandy-5-MeO-DALT-Thread):

I've noticed that DALT hasn't appeared on the RC market - possibly due to its close similarity to DPT - but I'm sure given time it will. Orally, I'd say it's again most probably more like DPT than anything else, so 40mg by that route isn't going to do much without some help from MAOI's

I actually doubt it is much like DPT, if you compare 4-AcO-DPT with 4-AcO-DALT, it seems that the former (and also 4-HO-DPT) can be be pretty damn powerful but 4-AcO-DALT is on the mild side. Or do you suppose you just need a shitload of 4-AcO-DALT to get effect?

I have a 500mg sample but it's not a priority at the moment.  I'm more interested in exploring DiPT and MXE before I get to DALT. I will certainly report back when I do though.

I absolutley will report back. I only purchased the sample because it was so rare. I'm not expecting very much out of it but then again I wasn't expecting much from 4-ho-dpt and it quickly became my all time favourite so who knows?  It might very well be next on the agenda but ultimately it's up to the research group and everyone seems keen on trying either DiPT or MXE next. We will see!

It is looking very likely that I will get to try this in a few days.  Already did a small allergy test with no problems. I will report back this weekend.

So I did try this stuff out at 60mg orally and didn't feel very much for about 2 hours so I took another 60mg and about an hour after that I felt a nice mildly euphoric feeling and when I shut my eyes I could see textures of something moving in the background but I could see no colours at all with eyes closed. It was like there was a light grey pattern moving against the total blackness of closed eyes. But that was about it. I felt pretty good for about an hour an that's all. About 6 hours after I dropped my girlfriend drove me to pick up some take out and when I was waiting for it I took out my phone and I could see that the text looked a bit wobbly on the screen. 

Pretty much a dud. I wouldn't get it again.

It's most likely bound to be a lot like DPT, maybe a bit less potent, so you should certainly have insuflated it.

I just got a small supply of this, I should be trying it at the least within the next few weeks. Based on intuition and this small and handy thread, I'll likely be testing it exclusively by insufflation. We'll see how it goes. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I still have mine, but I never got around to using it.... Honestly what little I have read has just made it sound really unimpressive and disappointing. It's been pretty low on my to-do list. I do intend to try it still and when I do so I will report back here but I just haven't really felt the desire to.... Maybe I'll get around to it next though since I would like to explore more but don't really feel the need for a crazy trip at the moment. I'll see how my stomach's feeling in a couple weeks....

Alright, so I tried this stuff this morning. I'm still on it right now  to an extent. I insufflated 40 mg up the left nostril and waited ten  minutes to see what it did before deciding if I would do more. The most  significant thing that I noticed was a steadily rising burn that was  really persistent; it wasn't as bad as snorting 2C-I but it was maybe  more throbbing. I suppose some people might not find it too bad if  you're used to snorting psychedelics but I'm usually kind of sensitive  to burns, and it's been a long time since I took anything that way.  Anyway, the burn was bad, but there was barely anything else happening  other than some very, very low threshold serotonin agonist effects for  me like increased salivation and my skin feeling a little weird. If I  really tried too I could make a little bit of visual flashing barely  happen, but I can kind of do this while sober anyway. So at exactly  T+0:10 I decided to insufflate for more. I had another 40 mg lined out  but half way through the it I kind of reconsidered whether or not I  really wanted to double the dose just yet since I've heard incredibly  little about this drug, so I just snorted at least a pretty significant  chunk of it, definitely more than half. I put the rest of the powder  aside so I can measure it out to get an exact number in a little while.  The burn got a lot worse at that point, to the point of tearing up and  feeling like my nose is plumping up. I had the urge to sneeze a lot but I  held out for a good ten minutes or so before letting that happen and I  never saw any powder come out, so I'm pretty confident that I got the  dose. My nose had been pretty clear beforehand but it was pretty snotty  afterward, and still is to this moment, about T+1:45. It took a lot  sneezing and tissues, but I'm finally getting to the point where I'm  just sniffling a lot. It's worth noting that the weather changed  severely here over the last couple of days, so I might have been a  little bit more sensitive to this going in even if I had been feeling  find.


Around the time I had started sneezing I also took a couple  hits of weed. I had felt like the effects of the DALT were increasing  in *some* way but I couldn't really pinpoint how, so I wanted to try to  bump it up a little bit. There's not really a whole lot to speak of.  There is still sort of a shading over my vision that tells me that  visuals could happen in some way, but they don't seem to be for me right  now. I did feel something of a warmth spreading through my body, which  was maybe the strongest tryptamine effect I noticed. It felt very  peaceful like all of the other tryptamines I've used, but was not  stimulating at all like any of the 4-subs, even the more sedating of  those give me a lot of energy stored up. This was more of a just a  blanket of relaxation like DMT. The feeling was sort of nice, but the  other main feeling I was getting was an increased and harder to check  heart rate, so I wasn't really too into it. After about twenty minutes  from the second dose and thirty from the first, I was starting to feel  pretty confident that this wasn't going to develop into anything  incredibly significant, and it had already pretty much stopped feeling  like it was continuing to rise. I ended up eating 10 mg of  chlordiazepoxide to calm my heart; it's notable that I normally take  double this dose for stimulation on psychedelics and it doesn't kill the  trip. I tend to try to balance it out by smoking some more weed and  doing a big balloon of nitrous before the benzo really kicks in too,  which seems to help for me. I ended up doing the same this time, so  around T+0:35 I'd say was when the balloon was done. Nitrous is always  crazy for me, and this time honestly wasn't too different from my normal  experiences with it, but it was a little more intricate and colorful  than normal, but not by much. I did feel like the DALT had kicked in a  little bit stronger after I started to return to reality though, which  was a very slow and funny transition.


The one thing I can really  say about the mindset of this drug is that while it was VERY mild at  this dose, what I did feel was sort of intense. This may reflect its  unsubstituted tryptamine status; the only other one I've tried to  compare it to is DMT. I still felt pretty normal in my state of mind and  more just really high now than anything, but there was still this very  vague filter over reality that made me start to associate variables of  my current situation with past events or stored stereotypes in my mind  and brings those connections into the present like psychedelics tend to  do for me. Due to a combination of the cold weather and gray skies  outside, dressing in PJs, the peaceful glow that I had, and the sneezing  and sniffling and watering eyes, I had sort of this weird nostalgia to  times in the past that I would stay at home while sick and just sort of  enjoy not having to do anything all day. It gave me a chuckle, but I'd  say that that was the most significant thing that I really experienced.  After that the trip became slowly more replaced with being high, which  is what I feel that it mostly is now. Heart rate and everything is back  to normal. And I'm down to just a little bit of sniffling.... If  anything remains, I'd say it's just a little bit of a body glow.


I  have no intention of insufflating this again. The amount required for  literally any effect vs the intensity of the burn was way too much for  me. I still have a good bit left to work with, so next I think I'll try  smoking it. Maybe that will prove more fruitful.

No problem, perpetualdawn. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) tweetycat, that's what I intend to find out. I know that smoking DPT HCl is effective, despite what people think.

I've heard that too. Is there a reason that the freebase would be more effective than the salt when it's inhaled?

In my experience with smoking/vaping the freebase and hcl of dpt, they seem about as effective, but freebase is much more comfortable and less harsh on the lungs.

Just thought I'd add a little update here. I haven't smoked the DALT yet but I did try a test dose of DPT and thought it might be worth mentioning for comparison. I tried smoking 25 mg of DPT HCl which I thought might be a very small, possibly inactive dose in myself. No other drugs besides weed and alcohol have been in my system since I tried the DALT.


I would be **extremely** cautious in saying that one is better than the other because DALT is such an unknown and DPT already has a great reputation of being powerful, and I've barely tried either of them at all, but so far I would have to say that I liked DALT more. Though, I didn't particularly like either one. I would say that my dose of DALT was only *very* slightly more active than this 25 mg of DPT, if even more active at all, considering that I also had weed that time but not this time. For future testing I will consider these doses about equivalent.


I don't really have much to say; psychedelic effects were threshold at best, similarly to the DALT, though I would say above placebo. Heart rate increases slightly, again like the DALT, and notable because it's unlike every other psychedelic for me except for DMT. I get the feeling that sigma-1 agonism might be at play here, just a guess anyway, based on my reactions to DXM and MDMA.... The only significant difference I noticed is that DPT actually started giving me very mild tremors reminiscent of 4-subbed tryptamines at this dose, which is not surprising based on what I've heard about it, but it was a little off-putting considering that there really wasn't anything else going on. I was hoping for more of the blanket feeling of relaxation that DALT gave me, but so far it seems to only share that with DMT.


Anyway, make of that what you will. I'll be back when I have more to report.

could it be, that if you smoke the HCl salt, you are effectively inhaling some gaseous HCl? I'm not sure, but I see the possibility... HCl is definately pretty harsh on your lungs ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

Hello everyone![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) My first post here outside of the welcome form. I have recently received a generously weighed 116mg sample from probably the same vendor mentioned above. I had heard very little about when purchased, but was making another purchase at the time so why not haha? The info on this says it's kind a DTPish but I've never done that for comparison. What would be a good starting/threshold dose(recommend of course) and likely best route of ROA? From what I've seen here it would appear to be insuffulation,  but I also saw it might be possible to be smoked? If so would it be more like DMT were it would be much stronger by weight or more like 4-AcO-DMT were it's essentially worthless due to the required amount to be smoked for effect. Again, sorry if I'm saying something redundant or this seemed so long haha, I'll learn![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

Well from reading Goddess Mode's report, I definitely wouldn't insufflate. I would go for either rectal, vaporization, IM, or IV.

Smoking (vapourising) is probably the way to go 4aco-dalt is actually quite decent that way.

So by "vaporization" could it be smoked with weed similar to hash per se`? Layer some of the DALT in the middle of a bowl lighting the top of the bowl gently so the herb acts as a charcoal and the DALT is never in direct contact with flame? Would that be an effective way of smoking/vaporizing?

No one would be able to say without knowing the vaporization temperature of DALT, comparing to other chemicals which are easily vaporized in that method's vaporization temperatures, and then seeing if it's in that range.

I registered here after being a long time lurker to hopefully shed some light on DALT. I received a free sample *snip*. Everyone is correct: INSUFFLATION IS PAIN! Just don't. I am used to insufflation, this isn't worth it. Alternatively, I tried smoking it. This created a nice body euphoria with very minimal CEVs. That is about it. The body high lasts for a while (I'm still on it). DALT is not mental or very visual, but it will make you feel nice for a little while. I hope this helps a little seeing as there is next to zero info out there.


EDIT: Upon further studies, plugging seems to be the preferred route so far.

I am on some mxe and reallllly want to plug some of this I have to find out what it does.


Then I realize I want to find out as in intelecually read about it or some such, and not actually experience it right now. So I will not be doing that. At some point in the next month or so I will most likely give it a shot, combined with mxe. If some magic can be found with this via RA at 100mg or less I will find out!


... just not today

well I took a small 1mg allergy test of DALT around 7pm. Took 20mg mxe via RA around 830.


Plugged 15mg DALT around 11pm and sat down to meditate. There was definatly a come up... anxious and what not. Leveled off into something with a definate tryptamine feel. I mean, knowing I took a tryp, I could tell one was in my system... barely. Meditated around 40 minutes. got up and started moving around, and I'm not sure I feel much of anything. Have around 90mg left, but I have somewhere to be at 830am. Don't want to use everything I have left, so I will leave it for another day. Probably take 30mg then the other 60 an hour later. Or maybe all of it at once.


hrrrrm.


For comparison, three weeks ago I did the same thing with DPT. 20mg mxe, then a few hours later 15mg DPT and sat down to meditate. There was no denying the DPT was there, the DALT I had to pay much more attention too.

I just packed a bowl containing 110 mg of well cushioned DALT, to be inhaled later in the evening. I'm not sure how much I'll end up smoking, but I may report back during, and will definitely report back after.

I just smoked, not sure how much as what's left is in between two piles of ash, but it was less than 110 mg. I am very high, it's very interesting. It is really intense, but totally calm at the same time. No visuals other than a sharper definition of edges and colours, and no real interesting thought developments or emotions. Just an incredibly strong feeling that I'm under the influence of something, that almost makes my head feel like a balloon being blown up with some kind of very heavy gas. I'm fairly relaxed and would be interested in trying this again, with an MAOI.

Not a rush perse, but I felt it almost instantly, and within a couple minutes of my last exhale, the effects seemed to have maxed out, and dissipated within 45 minutes.

Subject:

20 year old male, 160 lb, in good health. No tolerance to any drugs.


Substance:

30mg DALT HCL.

Off white crytals about the same size as ordinary table salt. A few slightly larger brown crystals scattered throughout.

Rectal, dissolved in 3mL warm tap water. Took about 5 min of stirring to dissolve.


Chronology:

Onset: 1 min

Coming up: 3 min

Plateau: 30 min

Coming down: 30 min

After effects: 2 hrs


Intensity (Shulgun scale):

+++ T+0:03 until T+0:30

++  T+0:30 until T+1:00

+   T+1:00 until T+3:00


Positive effects:

* Mental and physical stimulation

* Dissolving of boundaries

* Increased awareness of music

* Mood lift, euphoria

* General intensification of sensory input

* Time dilation

* Brightening of colours

* Pleasureful body high


Negative effects:

* Increased heart rate

* Increased salivation


Overall I really liked this stuff. But I'd say at this level at least it's a lot closer to a stimulant/empathogen than a psychedelic.

It's an old thread but I figured since not many have been posting experiences, I should. I have only vaporized as I heard other routes were ineffective, but may attempt insufflation as dpt fun up the nose. 


After an allergy test I had loaded 25 mgs  in my oil burner and took 3 hits. I figured it would be less potent than dmt and dpt, but was caught off guard by the relative intensity of effects. It was void of visuals, however the body high was like 50-60 mgs of dmt but slightly more abrasive and during the experience I pretty spaced out without much interesting thought processes. The entire high lasted about 30-45 minutes, and peaked at 5-7 minutes, it's a crawler, much slower onset than dmt. Can't say it was all that enjoyable an experience but was interesting, having freebased half of my gram I will probably sample it again.

I've recently tried DALT orally at 80 mg, 120 mg and 150 mg. At 80 mg, there was an short-lived up lifting stimulation. At 120 mg and 150 mg it was very reminiscent of a low/mid range dose of MDMA. Openness and euphoria was very present. The visual aspect was just barely present, but it was there. Maybe something equivalent to 10-15 mg of psylocin.

It came up so I tried it yesterday at 110mg. I wasn’t super excited based on reports but as others have suggested it’s nice. Enjoyed it more than I thought I would. Clearly not going to set the world alight but I can see a possible niche for many people - mild with no fear or hardship likely and totally functional. Just pleasant and not too long. No doubt be nice with weed if that’s your thing. This was cautious dosing. At least two people have taken 150mg; how much further it’s worth pushing given the mildness I don’t know so 100-150mg seems a good start for most till someone takes it further - probably some of the vapourised doses equate to 150 or more I’d guess.

Here’s my actual report - hope we get more feed back - certain can think of worse psychedelics


I swallow a cautious dose110mg of DALT. I didn’t fancy anything at all heavy duty so this seemed to fit the bill and it was just enough to get some idea of it rising very slowly from 15min and didn’t really peak till 1.5 or even 2hours. The weather was a hot and I was tired and we just loafed about the house for most of the time.

The effects were as expected very mild and subtle; I knew it would be distinct but wasn’t expecting much beyond a sort of generic tryptamine stimulation; I guess this is what I got although I actually liked it rather more than I thought; all very easy.

There are a couple of points that broadly relate it to 4AcO and 5MeO-DALT; the bodyfeel is pleasing and I would be curious to see if it turns out to have some of 5MeO strong sensory aspect. Food seemed good. Secondly it’s rather relaxed. Visually there is good definition. Initially it was almost stoning but by the peak fairly clear and good natured. I did have gentle mental images to some music on the radio at one point. Toward 3 hrs I felt it was moving away and residuals were not at all irritating, in fact on a walk I forgot about it but I think it was essentially gone by 5 or so hours.

Hello, I've been experimenting with this one for a while, here's my full report on it:


<details>
<summary>Report</summary>


Dose: 100 mg

ROA: Smoked

Setting: My bedroom

T0:00-Sandwiched the DALT between 2 layers of mugwort, its consistency is very granular, like salt. I light it, teasing it gently with the flame. The smoke is bitter and acrid, although a bit sweet too, better tasting than DMT. It goes down smoother too, although it is a bit harsh.


T0:07-By now the substance has sort of melted and consolidated and mixed with the burnt bits of plant material, forming a solid black mass that smells of the chemical. I can still get sizable hits by combusting this mass however.

The effects are anxiolytic and dissociating. It’s not the classical dissociative feeling of numbness and lack of coordination, rather a feeling of my body sinking into a warm bath and dissolving. There is also this sinking feeling focused on my head, a familiar dissociating sensation. A feeling like I can feel the weight of my brain inside my skull, that my meninges are the fabric of reality and my mind is sinking like a gravity well into its depths, and the rest of my being, my sense of body, my sense of self, is slowly sinking down into it, flashing, pulsing, rippling.

It has a flatness to it that reminds me of its cousin 5-MeO-DALT… For reference, that’s a feeling of my entire field of vision becoming a single flat image with no spatial distinction between objects or anything really, I am gazing upon one singular image. The taste in my mouth is now reminiscent of the way a clothing store smells.


T0:15-I feel like I am just fading, but it is so deeply comfortable and relaxing. It’s like a blanket has been thrown over my mind, smothering me in its reassuring warmth. I’m getting quite a head rush, it’s not a quick rush like water being sprayed from a firehose, but a great languid rush like watching a swollen river flow with debris. Everything feels like it’s going to be ok, it feels like the drug is gently holding my hand and coaxing me into the experience, it is humble and kind and knows that I am not going to experience too much intensity, but it wants to guide me there anyway like any good host would.

My vision is blurring and twitching and falling out of focus, but really just because I am not paying as much attention to visual input. OEV’s are there, but evade description. Like they are entirely noticeable, but don’t manifest in any familiar way. It’s not patterns, or warping, or breathing, or swirling, or shifts in color, no pulsing or bulging or rippling, things just look different. Maybe it’s a slight shift in perspective, or maybe it’s my mind being shifted off kilter in such a way that normal visual input is interpreted as being altered.


T0:25-It’s a gently warm overcast day with a nervous sun occasionally peeking through the clouds. The sense of calm and bliss is sublime, my bed feels more comfortable than ever and it feels like I am covered in great downy blankets. All I want to do is smile and feel gratitude that the current passage of time has left me unscathed with worries or troubles, that the world is flowing by and I am safe from all of it. The grey air feels like great warm waves washing over me, tossing me about in the tranquility of a balmy moonlit night at a secluded beach. Yet there is a physical restlessness I cannot shake, it twitches deep in my bones and in my veins, indeed my heart rate has felt artificially quickened during this experience despite my otherwise calm. It’s pulsing weight, pulsing flatness, gentle waves rocking me on a glassy lake.


T0:45-I am out of the peak now, there is just a stoned sedated feeling left, and I’m unfortunately not even left with the pleasant psychedelic afterglow that I enjoy from most other substances. It’s just a calm dazed feeling, and a sort of anxiolytic relaxation almost reminiscent of benzodiazepines. Sometimes there are flashes of jitteriness.


T1:30-Back to baseline.


Conclusion: DALT is a recipe for quick, acute, short lasting psychedelic bliss and relaxation. It’s like throwing a great warm psychedelic blanket over your mind, and having it dissolve over the course of an hour. It’s quite pleasant with a bit of restlessness deep in the body. If only it lasted longer, if only it was easier to consume. It’s both intense and lacking any sort of intensity, it’s a very unique and novel substance and experience, although many probably wouldn’t consider the effects ‘worthwhile’ in comparison to other psychedelics. DALT by itself is honestly not too interesting, it’s when combined with other drugs that it really shines.

I find it does the best when combined with other substances... I have reports for those too (beware wall of text)

<summary>DALT+2C-I</summary>


Dose: 50 mg (+15 mg 2C-I @T-6:00)ROA: Smoked

Setting: My backyard


Preface: I impulsively dosed 15 mg of 2C-I earlier that night. It was a pretty standard trip, I spent it at a friend’s house. I eventually went home and decided to test the interaction with DALT. At this point I was about 6 hours into the experience and I was on the comedown. The visuals had mostly died down, although some swirling patterns crept into the darkness at the corners of my vision. I relaxed in a bathtub in my backyard and packed the DALT between two layers of Cannabis.


T0:00-Light the bowl. Inundated by the familiar bittersweet flavor.


T0:06-Struck by the first notes of the experience. The relaxation I feel is immense and tangible, it’s like a great warm rain pouring down on me. The residual stimminess of the 2C-I gives way to the great warm flood of DALT, washing away the tension and extra energy in my nerves and in my veins. It feels like the sky is zooming in on me, like the vast intricate jigsaw puzzle of the night sky has become this proverbial psychedelic blanket that is draping over me now.


T0:14-The visuals have picked up quite a bit, they are vast airy patterns that are folding and transforming and dancing in the distant reaches of my vision. DALT on its own is certainly not visual, but when combined with psychedelics it truly has a unique way of bringing their visual aspect back. This is also likely from the cannabis that was consumed concurrently. The visuals do not entirely resemble the 2C-I visuals however, they seem blunted, softened, rounded, rendered more blocky and less intricate, though more organic in their flow and behavior. No auditory effects are noted other than things sounded a bit blurry and lo fi. I am lying in this bathtub and sinking into it, it feels like I am really taking a warm bath and gently sinking below the surface.


T0:20-Music is fantastic and I can so pleasantly and easily sink into it. Imagine being in the shallows of a warm tropical sea, the moonlight illuminating the ripples of sand the silhouettes of palm trees in the distance, and then imagine diving into the warm water, like the embrace of bathwater, and lying on the bottom, no sound except for the gentle creeping of the waves above, no feeling except the gentle flow of the water as it ambles around your form. Then introduce music into the equation, cutting through the water like a crystal katana, shimmering into your ears like a cascade of dancing crystals. The soundwaves vibrate the water around you and each pulse of bass, each slithering melody cradles you and ripples the sand beneath you. This is what it felt like. I know I can get up and move and be functional, but I choose not to, this is so comfortable and I want to sink into it as intensely and as best I can.


T0:40-I finally decide to get up and go back inside. It was a pleasant experience, I’m mostly down now, although there are definitely residual visuals that were stronger than when I started.

<summary>DALT + LSD</summary>


Dose: 90 mg (+200 ug LSD @T-4:00)ROA: Smoked

Setting: All around my apartment


Preface: We were hosting a party at my house today. But it wasn’t until night. I decided to take some very good acid and see the new star wars movie in a theater with my friend who was also tripping. Afterwards, we got to my house, and remembering my most recent experiment with DALT, decide now is prime time to try it again. I packed 90 mg into a small bowl of Cannabis and let loose. I am more or less at just off the peak of the trip.


T0:00-I’m in my basement, people are already upstairs hanging out before the party. I decide to hang out here by myself to spare them the burnt rc smell. The ratio of DALT to cannabis in the bowl is leaned heavily towards the DALT, and after a few hits it consolidates into one solid chunk. I hit the hot acrid smoke for a while, it feels like it’s slithering down my throat like a centipede.


T0:15-I’ve finished smoking the bowl and I am already feeling like I have dropped off the edge. It feels as though the room has become spherical and is shrinking around me. The patterns of the visuals bulge like a fisheye lens or some sort of dome. My body feels heavy and faded, as if it’s turning to static. I decide to go up to my bedroom, it feels like I’m floating the whole way there like a disembodied head and shoulders.


T0:20-I’m in my bedroom and I am properly tripping balls. I am a bit anxious, I feel as though I am tripping way too hard to host a party at my house. The bodily dissociation is heavy and it all feeds into this headspace of mental dissociation from reality, of dissociation from causality and the flow of time, of dissociation from my physical surroundings and other human presences. Despite the anxiety, my fading body is overwhelmed with a physical flood of calm, at odds with my racing thoughts. The visuals have kicked up, but they do not resemble the intricate patterning of LSD. Instead, they are blocky and resemble a dome with a grid on it, like the inside of the dome of the pantheon. This grid is flashing with cool colors and reeling around me, sucking me into its splendor and dizzying my mind. People begin to arrive and all I can do is just lie back and stare at the ceiling, unable to engage or interact meaningfully.


T0:50-I’m so dizzy and out of it still. I manage to go downstairs and interact with people, although I really cannot do much but talk about how hard I’m tripping. My roommate plays some stuff on his guitar and I curl up with my eyes closed and sink into an exquisite world of CEV’s, flowing blocky shapes that stream past me and reverberate into infinity. It’s like speeding down a gridded tunnel, while my body is sedated and couchlocked and immobile. My short term memory has been rendered impotent. Attempts to converse with people fall apart as I forget what we are talking about midway through the conversation. Not ideal for socializing.


T1:50-I smoke a lot of weed throughout the party, and it just rockets me further and further away. I find myself curled up on the floor wishing these drugs would release their iron grip on my mind. It feels like a great iridescent steely hand is stretching my mind away like bubblegum, geometric forms and fractals spilling from it. I definitely don’t feel like I am stoned + tripping, but rather that the trip has been amplified far beyond what it should be at this point in time. It doesn’t just feel like I am enhancing the LSD, but rather I am being bombarded with the convalescence of all of the drugs at once.


T3:30-It has calmed down by now, I am functional and able to be social, and cannabis no longer smacks me in the face like it was earlier. All of the psychedelics seemed to have released their hold on me.

<summary>DALT + Ketamine</summary>


Dose: 50 mg (+ 170 mg Ketamine @T-2:00 & 120 mg Ketamine @T-0:30)ROA: Smoked

Setting: My bedroom


Preface: My friends and roommates and I decided to just have a ketamine party night. I started off the night with 170 mg, and then topped it off bit later with 120 mg. In my ketamine fog I somehow remembered that I wanted to test DALT with a dissociative, and what dissociative is more pure and neutral than ketamine? I went upstairs with a friend away from other people, and somehow managed to grind up some weed and pack a bowl with the DALT sprinkled on top. It’s a miracle I didn’t spill it everywhere. I also don’t know how I ever managed to gently light the bowl, but I made do. I shared this bowl with my friend.


T0:00-Taste the smoke. I can certainly taste its flavor, but the dissociation prevents me from detecting any of its unpleasant acridity.


T0:08-That pleasant and familiar relaxation washes over me. The ketamine makes me feel like I am liquid, that my body is a slick of oil bobbing on the surface of a gentle lake, and the DALT becomes a ripple that slowly takes the unctuous slick to pieces, gently and calmly dissolves my sense of self into the space around me.


T0:15-The visual aspect has kicked in. Ketamine gives me some light patterned visuals but now they are out full force, transparent patterns overlaid on every surface, warping them, bulging and distorting everything. The room suddenly feels very very small, it’s as if I have grown in size, or it has closed in around me, but it’s a very comfortable and cozy feeling. The room also appears to be spherical.


T0:20-I sit back on my bed and listen to music, my friend is on the floor. I close my eyes and my body fades away, and I am brought into a great dark world of streaming and rushing cubes and prisms, all of them gently lit from a distance by an eerie turquoise light. The shapes dance and move with the music, and it feels as though my body is being spun and twisted around in all sorts of absurd ways, but once again, it’s quite relaxing and not distressing in the least. Almost like a strange cosmic massage.


T0:30-It seems to already be wearing off. I go back downstairs still feeling floaty and fuzzy, with a vital warmth smoldering deep inside of me.

<summary>DALT + 3-MeO-PCP + 2C-B + LSD</summary>


(Excerpt from another report I wrote)

Dose: 80 mg + (200 ug LSD @ T-7:00, 35 mg 2C-B @ T-6:00, 10 mg 3-MeO-PCP @ T-4:00 & T-1:35)

ROA: Smoked

Setting: My bedroom


T7:00 (T0:00)-The smoke tastes like sweet DMT, it is a very subtle but manageable acrid, it tastes sort of like pumpkins but it is wholly a unique odor. Each hit I take feels like I am being pulled further and further out from reality, into a grand fractal globe of repeating concentric patterns. Like a great cosmic tongue, reaching out to taste me, and my essence swirling away from me to meet it. At last it savors my flavor, and draws me into its maw. I am truly gone.


T7:20 (T0:20)-I close my eyes and it feel my body fade to nothing. I feel it melt into my sheets, become a part of the great fractallized diamond everything around me. I am so distant from myself, I feel the love of some motherly feminine essence envelop me. It feels like an embrace from the fluffy legs of a moth, it feels like being enshrouded in its dusty wings. A great green glow permeates this realm and cascades around me. I do not feel like I am contacting an entity, merely touching with and embracing a personification of some inherent essence of the universe or of my internal self. I feel this great motherly presence descend from the sky and enshroud me in great smoky fingers. It feels like the hand of god, it feels like divine protection and the fire of life and the burning back of forests of death. A great glowing pastel crystal fractal flower blooms above me and blossoms into infinity. Death is something to think about here. My heart is racing, what would happen if I were to die? My existence, everything became a great intricate skull, one that seemed to be woven from a billion waxy fibers, it was like a cattle skull, flashing in deep green and crimson, it was the idea of death, encapsulating all the fears and notions the living hold towards it. It was a great desert that was blossoming with life, it was an oasis of existence. Everything felt so natural and perfectly in place, and so beautiful. I felt cleansed and healed, the energy was pastel pink, green, turquoise and blue. I felt the same strike of life force I’ve gotten from other trips, especially mixing psychedelics and dissociatives. This essence,  this non-entity that I mentioned before is wrapping me in its dusky wings and singing soothing songs that cascade onto my brain.

<summary>DALT + 3-MeO-PCP + 4-AcO-DET + Ketamine</summary>


(Excerpt from another report I wrote)

Dose:50 mg + (10 mg 3-MeO-PCP @ T-4:00, 20 mg 4-AcO-DET @T-2:30, 150 mg of Ketamine @T+1:20)

ROA: Smoked

Setting: My Bedroom


T4:00 (T0:00)-I pop downstairs briefly to ask whether I should administer ketamine. I feel anxiety about tripping so hard when there are so many people in my house. I figure at least informing them of the drugs I am about to use will lessen some of the burden. I am still apprehensive though. I go up to my room and smoke a bowl of DALT. I feel like I am being unraveled into ribbons, polychrome and intertwining. I am razor sharp, I am an arrow piercing through the turbulence that has become my reality, flowers blossoming in my path. There is no doubt in my mind now. I must go deeper. I am ready.


T4:30 (T0:30)-Somehow in this state I manage to crush some ketamine and cut it into a line. The onset feels immediate, it’s like my mind is a snowglobe and I just shook it up. I feel like I am floating in water, my entire room has been flooded. Time kinda stops being a thing after this. I remember lying on my bed, and having it feel like there is warmth rising up from beneath me, I feel like I have become gaseous and this warmth is carrying my form upwards. It feels like steam. Psychedelic visuals begin to kick into next gear, with my entire field of vision warping, melting, and bubbling. Glowing tracers and rippling auras begin to form all around me, obscuring my existence in a beautiful but chaotic morass. I have notes from this but honestly they are completely incoherent.

To the best of my memory, it gradually felt like I had undergone a total paradigm shift. I kept falling into trances. Every time I fell into a trance, it was like an entire new world was being generated around me, a world with its own set of physical laws and properties. Within each world that formed, I found myself to inherently carry the knowledge of its properties and history. I knew exactly where I was, exactly what I was doing there, and exactly how everything there worked. But in each world I was stricken by a longing to return home, I felt like I was out and about but shirking some responsibility, a responsibility to keep track of my body back in this world. It was as though my body was a toddler, prone to wandering into danger, and each time I travelled into a world I was leaving it unattended, potentially in harms way. So each journey I made left me with a distinct feeling of anxiety and irresponsibility. I was tripping right fucking hard. My eyes would drift shut as of their own volition, catapulting me into a trance and a new world. If I could remind myself of how my body worked, I could open my eyes and briefly pull myself out to check on my body and make sure it was in working order. But I would soon accidentally drift off into another realm again.

One recurring theme was predestination and predetermination. Across all of these realms was this foreboding sense of omniscience, of experiencing the entirety of time at once. Visually, it at one point manifested as an infinite grid, each block a vectored point in time and space, all the possibilities of existence laid out before me, and an indescribable sentience dictating my path through this grid. Freaky stuff. This sense of predetermination was very ominous, it felt as if some disaster was lined up for me, and I was blindly careening towards it. The other ominous feeling was that I was hacking into the fabric of reality, and that something did not want me doing that. It felt as though I was going to stumble upon an infinite darkness that would shatter my mind permanently, that this was forbidden knowledge that I was touching upon.


Otherwise, I recall seeing a lot of fractalizing shapes and repeated sequences of forms, each one gradually shrinking in size and tapering into infinity. Great segmented forms loomed over me. In one I remember floating in a shallow sea, this immense segmented pink sentient tower looming above me. There was constant worry about what those beneath me were thinking of me and saying. I thought I heard my name. I thought they were talking about me. I was tripping wayyyyyy too hard to be near anyone. I was deeply shaken. At some points I managed to hoist myself up to get a drink from the bathroom. I actually managed to walk and operate a faucet. I almost became trapped in my bathroom as it became a cage of magenta iridescent forms. It felt like the world was a rocking boat, typical of dissociatives. Back in my room I continued to drift in and out of these worlds. At this point I was getting more used to it, and I had the precedent of my body remaning restrained and peaceful. I allowed myself to drift further, felt more content and less anxious. God I wish I could recall these worlds, perhaps I need to trigger this state again to revisit them? My reality had been shattered, and each shard painted a different color. One world in this stage of the trip was simply a vast nothingness pockmarked with an infinite 3 dimensional array of glowing sigils, representing some language I could never comprehend. In another, the ambient sounds around me began to take up synesthetic representations as a fantastic bestiary of sound creatures. Music was incredible in this state, each sound contributing to a diverse jungle or coral reef of blossoming and personified phonics. Eventually I settled down enough that I was no longer accidentally drifting off into different realms. I stepped outside my room. The whole house was dark. I turned to face a wall, and began to tap and dance my fingers across it. They rippled wherever they touched and from each point of contact a glowing reticulated pattern bloomed, looking like a tangled circuitboard, or the veins of an insects wings. I was able to pretty coherently talk to my friend who was sitting on the stairs. Floral patterns still adorned the darkness all around me. They didn’t want to watch the movie so we went back to my room. Eventually the other friends followed.


Conclusion: DALT on its own can be sprinkled onto a bowl to give a nice relaxing psychedelic edge to smoking, though its questionable if that’s worth dirtying a bowl with the smell/residue. Where it really shines is in combination with other psychedelics. It grabs them by the hand and elevates the experience to an entirely new place, a relaxing and comfortable and unique places that is very different than just amplifying an experience with weed. Perhaps most valuable though is the immense anxiolytic effect- I have not attempted this while having a stressful trip, but I postulate that it could put a damper on anxious experiences and wash the user in a pleasant bath of relaxation.

I am not much one for mixing but I know of someone who’s been using DALT in combos upto 150mg for a while now; it seem quite nice and gentle so I’d like to see more what it does on it’s own on that basis; think it’s a freebase too so may try that option.

Interesting how much of a difference moving both chains up from propyl to allyl changes the molecule.  Haven't heard much about this one but it seems like 2 allyls really make the tryptamines less interesting, and less potent.

Bump, was rummaging through the collection yesterday, found some DALT, thought hey why not, there's so little info on it.

Another 10 mins later and perception slightly altered, nothing but treshold, so I decide to take more. 35 mins after dropping the initial dose I weigh out another 70 mg's for 120 mg total, as I'm typing this 20 mins later I feel the second dose taking effect, still not more than a very light relaxed state of mind, a bit floaty.

No oevs, no cevs, pupils are pinpointed, floatiness intensifies after the weed, bit of that tryptamine buzz going on. Saliva increases, nausea does too for a few mins, effects are finally taking hold a bit more, breathing feels different, not laboured, numbed is more apt, fuzziness and the buzz are now reminiscent of dpt, but wonkier. If dpt has that electric jolting feeling, this feels more like a gentle cobble of waves, or something.

Just enjoying it, not really paying much attention to the effects anymore. Appetite was fine too, could still eat normally.

Weird substance, mostly a bodyhigh, at this dosage enjoyable, but I can see how it could become annoying when you go higher. Curious to see where 150 mg in one go would take me, not in a hurry to try it though.

Thanks for the report. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  I have tried 5-MeO-DALT once, I have mroe and will do some more trials.  Probably won't ever obtain DALT as there are so many tryptamines I'd rather have.

Ah this was the cheapest gram of anything I've ever gotten, was mostly on the lookout for a lot of gentle simple trypts back then, couldn't let this one go. Don't think I'll ever do more than 1-3 trials with it. This has been in remarkable condition considering it's the same age as the MET and MiPT I had gotten at the same time, rapid oxidation on both of those, nearly everything turned brown, MET almost gooey, pity. DALT looks maybe the slightlest bit tan, but still overbearingly white, same to the 5-MeO-DALT, which is all sparkly white still.


I completely forgot to post this manuscript I found previously while googling DALT, wasn't all too much information out there, but I still found this interesting and pretty relevant. No idea if it's been posted on site elsewhere already, but it fits here:


[http://researchonline.ljmu.ac.uk/id/eprint/2402/1/ToxLett_17.15.49.pdf](http://researchonline.ljmu.ac.uk/id/eprint/2402/1/ToxLett_17.15.49.pdf)


> Conclusions The presented study showed that with the exception of DMT all tested TDNPS showed more or less inhibition potential against the various CYP isoforms. Because of this inhibition potential in the range of clinical relevant inhibitors and similar plasma concentrations, the following drugs might cause clinically relevant interactions with the given CYPs: CYP1A2, 4- MeO-AMT, 5-F-2-Me-AMT, 5-Cl-AMT, 6-F-AMT, 7-Me-AMT, all DALTs; CYP2A6, AMT, 6-F-AMT; CYP2D6, AMT, 5-F-AMT, 5-F-2-Me-AMT, 5-Cl-AMT, all DALTs, 4-HO-DiPT; CYP2E1, 5-Me-DALT, 5-MeO-DALT, 5-MeO-2-Me-DALT; CYP3A, 5-F-2-Me-DALT, 5-ClDALT, 5-Br-DALT, 5-Me-DALT, 6-F-DALT. Thus, these TDNPS could change the pharmacokinetics, namely the plasma levels and the corresponding effects of co-administered therapeutics or NPS. Prodrugs such as tramadol, tilidine, or risperidone, mainly metabolized by one or two isoenzyme, could lose their potency, if bioactivation was blocked (Mannheimer et al., 2008; Stamer et al., 2007; Wustrow et al., 2012). Neuroleptics such as clozapine or haloperidol could accumulate in plasma and lead to toxic concentrations (Murray, 2006). The inhibition of CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 could be important because many endogenous compounds and xenobiotics were metabolized by these two isoenzymes ([http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/clinical-table/](http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/clinical-table/)). However, it should be kept in mind that clinical cases or studies would be desirable to finally assess the risks associated with drug-drug interactions.

I have mentioned my 110mg trial and tried 150mg orally a few months back; go for walk with S and her grandchild L: not much stronger than 110g; an effects ill defined something in the vision. Slightly sedate. Odd feeling > mild malaise so suspect more not worth it. Felt most part down with 3hrs but things look fractionally trippy when home but down in another hour or two. It was really just a mild tryptamine buzz more than anything. Not had any luck with vaping it.

I tried smoking this for the first time yesterday, here's my trip report from another thread.

My smoked DMT trips usually seem weaker than what other people describe and come with a very unpleasant body load that mostly makes me not like the experience. My smoked synthetic base tryptamines trips usually seem stronger than what other people describe and are usually very pleasant and smooth. I really like smoking synthetic base tryptamines and a lot of the things I've ever experienced that were alike how people describe smoking DMT actually happened for me on them instead despite not having experienced those things on DMT myself.

The heaviest part of the effects lasted for around twenty minutes, the full duration beyond an afterglow lasted around an hour, and I felt good for the rest of the day and still feel good now, similar to smoking other synthetic base tryptamines in that regard. Body load was negligible, some effects like dry mouth might have been present in retrospect but nothing really above that.

It's not one of those tryptamines that seems visually subtle to the point of being grayscale, it just comes out slowly and in the edges of things, more alike LSD than DMT in that way. The imagery in its patterning can get very vividly detailed though, more alike other base tryptamines than other psychedelics in general. The most memorable thing for me in that way from this trip was a point where I was seeing a pattern across my field of vision made of beautiful purple flowers that looked kind of like roses, and they were moving like a standard repeating mandala or gear-like pattern, but they were very clearly well-defined flowers, not just flower-shaped. This was while lying in bed in the dark and the pattern was less than half opaque but very stable and visible. The flower theme reappeared later in the shower when I briefly felt like a flower spawned and blossomed on top of my head.

It felt like the stereotypical DMT hyperspace story of having an surgical operation performed on you during an alien abduction but not in a clean and clinical way and not as alien, it felt more like being toyed with by human-like cosmic entities acting like wild animals but more cruel, at least one of whom I recognized. The imagery was immersive but not transporting, I was still lying in bed watching a transparent vision behind closed eyes, but feeling like I was a part of that vision still. It did not last long and broke up into still notably detailed but weaker visuals that dispersed more into the general patterning that remained in the edges of things for the rest of the trip. I do remember at some point before I got out of bed, there were visions of women joined together in a half-helix structure of a kind I've seen when smoking salvia on LSD before, each one with a hand outstretched to grab the ankle of the one above them forming an infinite chain, and I reached my hand out to join them and became part of the chain.

I find DALT to be a very calming substance that actually reduced the anxiety I felt before smoking it, something that I've found to be true of MET as well. The trip was somewhat weird but in a playful way that was recognizably psychedelic, and not as distinct from the classic psychedelics as something like DPT which it does have some other similarities to such as in the calmness relative to the base DMT. I came out of it feeling like I had some good thoughts and personal insights and was in a better mood than I went into it in, which was already okay. I spent much of the night catching up on new Rick and Morty episodes I hadn't seen yet with a friend with good immersion.

Scientific data suggests that its affinity for 5-HT2A receptors is only about twice as high as its affinity for dopamine transporters and only about three and a half times as high as its affinity for kappa-opioid receptors ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6230509/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6230509/)). It also has slightly higher affinity for norepinephrine transporters than for dopamine transporters and its affinity for the serotonin transporter is higher than any of these, about four and a half times more than for 5-HT2A receptors. It also has an interesting monoamine receptor agonist profile, with high relative affinity for various receptors like 5-HT1A, 5-HT2B, alpha2A-adrenergic, and D3, along with high affinity for both sigma-1 and sigma-2 receptors. I'm glad to have the chance to experience it and try to understand how that pharmacological profile translates into subjective activity.

Found an old sample of the HCl salt. I never tried it because of all the lackluster reports, but I finally gave it a try. With 30 mg insufflated, onset was rapid, with first alert at 5 minutes, then a rapid increase in heartbeat, mild tremors, and what I can only describe as a tryptamine body high. Visually, things were a little more crisp and bright, but nothing else. Effects were tingling body sensations and a stoning effect that was almost sedating. Overall effects were bizarre and wore off in 90 minutes. I’m not sure what place this would have, but I might try combining it with other things. It’s short onset and duration might fit well with other, longer lasting tryptamines.
