[original post:]


i'm interested in PCP, and since there is not really a PCP thread, I guess i'll open one. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


unfortunately, erowid information is quite limited, so i am still searching for basic some basic information:


what are the pros and cons of the different methods of administration (smoking, snorting, eating)? how does smoking of pure PCP work - with a smoke bubble?


how are the dosage levels? erowid just says some vague things about "5-10 mg", and in most trip reports, there is just talked about smoking "some PCP laced herbs"


and finally, how long does the trip last?

Ya know, I was going to say that I was suprised by the fact that PD does not have a PCP Big and Dandy, but then I realized that it also does not have an LSD Big and Dandy. The "oldies" apparently don't need their own threads. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

I was slipped PCP when I was young without being told the first time it was tried; since I had no idea I had injested anything but weed, I thought that the tunnel vision was actually me slipping off into the universe and I was afraid I was going to get lost (the whole world appeared to be painted onto two marbles that were retreating into a darkness that was all around me). 


PCP made me feel like a ghost, in a world of ghosts. People would be in front of me talking, and move away, but their afterimage was still in front of me and would slowly fade or appear to blow away. I also felt like I was above myself looking down at myself many times.


With other drugs the 'mindfuck' arises and I can separate from it. With PCP I was aware of it for a split second and then I would be overwhelmed by it. It was like getting caught in a violent brainstorm. I would literally forget where I was going or feel like it was taking hours to cross a street.


I'd say, for myself anyway, that it was very intense.

Good idea!


And I'm totally aware there's no LSD Big and Dandy... I'm not sure why those who began the B&D thread tradition didn't make one right off the bat.  But they didn't, and now it's a daunting task to try to combine all the LSD info into one without being redundant or having a 2,000 post thread!


One day I'll do it though.  It's been on my list.

sadly to say virtually everybody i know who has taken pcp their first time (including me) have had no prior knowledge to the drug they were taking. usually it was laced in weed or some other drug. pcp comes in a water soluble hcl salt or freebase oil and overdose level is as low as 50mg oral.

My only experience with PCP was somewhat scary as I was expecting something ketamine-like, but the stimulating aspect of PCP meant that I couldn't just sort of switch off and ride it through as I can with ketamine when it goes dark and frightening. Possibly it was also because with ket I can tell myself that in half an hour any such things will have well and truely subsided - the thought of it going on for hours due to PCP's length of action probably helped in contributing to the unpleasant feel. Overall PCP compared to ketamine the way that say tryptamines compare to PEAs - much less controllable & malleable; with a dissociate that means it can become way more distressing (hence my reluctance to try PCP aghain despite my ongoing love affair with ketamine)

i would love to try pcp, its just a matter of finding reliable clean pcp. people are always afraid of getting their drugs laced with pcp, im afraid of getting my pcp laced with unreacted poison. if i could get pure phencyclidine im almost sure i would enjoy it. it just has a remarkable stigma.

sometimes I smoke weed with sketchy people. I am sort of afraid of ingesting PCP without being told (someone forgets to say its in the marijuana) as a couple past friends of mine have had similar experiences.


Question to those who have smoked weed laced with PCP: Can you see any sign that the weed is laced, such as a chemical smell to the smoke or a strange reaction when you light the material, or even just appearance of the green (can you lace nuggets or must you chop up the weed to lace it?).


This is all very foreign to me, but I have come into contact with PCP before so I know its out there. I hope to never smoke that stuff, it sounds like a horrible drug...and one experience with ingesting a roll which was apparently PCP convinced me to never pursue it.

I've only been around it once, with some guys smoking it in a joint. It had a distinct chemical twang to it. I wasn't puffing on it though, so I have no idea about the taste. I also had no clue how much was in the joint, so i wasn't about to try it (not the sharpest folks around).

I'm not completely against trying pcp, but I definately would take it slower than almost any other drug I've tried.  Dissociatives are among my favorite drugs![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

theres almost a liquid smoke type flavor when you get wet off a cigarette, kind of that over powering flavoring that bottled liquid smoke gives meat

PCP is an EXTREMELY intense dissociative psychedelic/anaesthetic.  Some people freak out on it, sure.  But that's the same with all hardcore psychedelics. 


I do believe, however, that for hardcore psychonauts it could be very useful, to the degree of ketamine at least, if not moreso.  You just have to know what's coming and how to handle it, I think.


If I had a reliable source and knew exactly what i was getting and how much of it, I would probably experiment with phencyclidine.


It's too bad that most PCP comes from Compton and is bought sold and used there.  That is an extremely ghetto area and you'd be likely to get ripped off or killed if you (a white person) walked up to a black thug in Compton asking for PCP.  So unfortunately, there is no reliable source for me that I know of.  I'm not going to go walking around Compton trying to cop.

I have never been scared away by the intense experience, that part I would look forward to. I just have an issue with being in that dissociative state and still having the ability to walk around and mingle with society. I have yet to find a dose of Ketamine that was too much, I love that mind space, but PCP scares me in that I could still get into that mind state, and still be able to wander around, K renders you incapable of doing that. Granted, I'm not sure how much of the "stigma" surrounding PCP is facilitating that fear of it, but it is still a substance I am leary of.

Went with 5mg rectally - that way if I got strong alerts in the first 5 mins I could get rid of it really quickly before it all become too much. As it was I didn't (well I don't think I did) have to do that, but as to how long it lasted, I really can't remember as it left me with fucked up time perception & understanding quite what it felt like for quite a while - several hours is the best I can do

I wonder if a research chemical company would ever do a custom synthesis of phencyclidine or any of its analogues.  One certain vendor comes to mind.  What do you guys think?  Could it happen?

*big willie show off*


My brother used to regularly smoke PCP, crack and DMT on top of shwag weed, said it was the makings of one hell of a ride. Apparently PCP is like a amped up ketamine trip.


I realy need to get my brother to comment to these types of trheads, he's done everything imaginable, though he does goes through bouts of mania in which he walks to the nearist mental hospital for a short detox stay.

this is precisely the reason I have not tried this compound yet. when i think of some of the things i thought on k, i have to say i was glad i was safely at home and not mingling. at best it might be very embarrassing, at the worst i might put myself or others in considerable danger.

PCP is my favorite drug/psychedelic, as far as dissociatives go, it's way better than ketamine or DXM.  I don't know what this "fear of walking around" is about as pcp is absolutely no different than any other dissociative in that regard, u can't walk when ur totally dissociated.  The biggest problem with pcp is the fact that it's a ghetto drug and as such it is ghettotized with the most awful cuts imaginable, they actually cut the shit with embalming fluid, starterfluid, and other disgusting chems/solvents and the purity and concentration of each batch is also a mystery unless u get pure crystal pcp which is great.  The main thing about dust that gives it a bad name i think is that it gets used by people who have never and would never touch a psychedelic drug yet pcp is probly one of the strongest out there.


It's very similar to dxm, only no matter what dose i take of dust i don't black out, it is very stimulating and i would rate it way better than mdma in terms of sheer euphoria.  the hole is very different than dxm, u retaine much more of yer normal self on dxm but pcp is total egodeath, and obliterates everything i know about life as i know it.  In this state i've wondered alot about my role in existence, i forget most of what i know about a normal life and think that i've lived in the bizarre state.  It sounds scary but i find it liberating and yer just to high to be scared anyway, it's pretty amazing, i feel one with everything in the universe. i feel conected with everyone and sometimes i even get psychic abilities which sounds like i'm full of shit or insane i know, but once in a while it will happen.  I also get this ultraintense confidence like i can do anything i set my mind to-"the world is my oyster" as they say, we call it dust invincibility.  It's also extremely sexual, more so than anyother drug IMO. i luv the fact that it usually lasts longer than anyother dissociative, i've been in "dustclouds"(just high) from anywhere from a few hours to a few days off one .  One of the greatest trips I've had was Ayahuasca and Dust together

what cracked out chemist is synthing up PCP only to sell it to the ghettoest dirt bags on the streets? thats my question, where do all these yo' boys get there stash from? not to sound racist but it sounds like alot more money could be made selling it on the hippie tour, NOT on the corner with crack. Iv never come across it other then up in northern virginia/DC/souther MD area around the ghetto. 


maybe they are getting it from the latinos as they have connects in mexico, who knows, it could be pharm grade when they get it then they sell it to the balcks who then sell it. I dont know, but I bet a good book could be written about the history of PCP on the streets.

I TOTALLY agree, this is probly one of if not THE biggest mysteries in the drug scene period.  I perplexed over this 4 a long time.  When "freinds" of mine bring street bottles to raves or on tour they sell out like crazy.  It's such a potent and easy drug to make too.  Why is it so hard to get amongst the more "enlightened" crowds i will never know.  Most of the dealers I know that move it in large quantities are jamaican or west indian or sumthng, it's mostly an american drug but it's origens are as far as i know a complete mystery

From a health point of view, I find this statement from Wikipedia quite worthy of taking into consideration prior to ingesting this drug:


"Although the primary psychoactive effects of the drug only last hours, total elimination from the body is prolonged, typically extending over weeks."


In other words, your liver and kidneys will probably go into overdrive and work hard to remove the toxin that is PCP.

**Drunken Submarine**


PCP is one of the few drugs I kind of regret taking. mainly because of the hype about holes in your brain, permanent dissociation, etc. but hehe, it was worth it (only had a gram). It's one damned weird drug and I would not call it a psychedelic at all. it is like a combo of alcohol and, I dunno, gasoline? On the up side, it DID make me feel like I was in a (drunken) submarine.

  Live right outside of DC, near the Ghetto if you will. Lots of my friends get the stuff like water, hell thats what they call it.  Very Available.  Usually get the liquid and just dip cigs and smoke em.  I havent had a chance to try it yet, still debating.  My one friend who does it often frequently describes it as floating while swiming through water, speed wise you seem to move slowly. Sounds crazy.

I totally agree.  I wish it was sold as common psychedelics are like LSD and mushrooms.  Not on the street with homeless people and crack in Compton who have *no business whatsoever* taking a strong psychedelic such as phencyclidine.


I wish I could get some PCP to experiment with that wasn't cut with ghetto shit.  Also not laced in weed.  I might be interested in some good PCP liquid if I ever came across it.  Pure crystal I would totally be willing to research with.


And I agree, there should be a book written about it.

I have no idea if mine was cut or not, but it was a white crystal powder, but I can't remember how it smells like enough to describe...kinda chemically I guess. I did a few lines at a time, like 3 to 5 medium sized, .1 g or somethin

I used to smoke cigs dipped in the shit. Came straight from East LA street gangs I still know. 


The first thing I remmeber was the ringing in my ears. Like a fucking 10 foot wave. 


BAM! 


Then it was like the world was ten feet away from me. The first few trips were rather enjoyable. 


...then I smoked a whole dipped cig- alone in my lonely apartment on the beach. 


I have never been one to put too much faith in faith or god for that matter, but when I was sitting on that toilet in that dark little bathroom, absoluetly crying my eyes out while not understanding why, while on the phone with some girl I persuaded out of some 12 step program to come to my place and smoke some more, I came to the realization that PCP was just not the drug for me. I also felt like I saw god himself. He told me "No!" lol


This shit came in a "port," a dark colored, pharmacutical looking bottle.  It smelled like pure hell. 


I sure did walk on the dark side of the moon though.

This is one substance in particular for which it seems its urban legendary status has far eclipsed the reality of its experience.  For many, the first experience with phencyclidine will hearken to mind remembrances of the first experience with marijuana upon a D.A.R.E. indoctrinated mind.  In other words, PCP is not the incarnation of the demon overlord delivered unto this world to cast open the gates unto the bowels of hell - contrary to popular legend.

It is a drug.  A powerfully dissociative drug, which is emphatically not recommended for those not properly prepared, or informed.  However, for those individuals, such as myself, who have had, or who are in the midst of a love affair with the dissociative compounds, this one should definitely be up there on your life's little to-do list.

That being said, the majority of the valuable lessons that this particular chemical has the potential to bestow can most likely be acquired far more safely through the use of Ketamine or even dextromethorphan.  Individuals who are not die-hard enthusiasts of the dissociative genre, and those who lack the experience and common sense to properly setup an environment conducive to the safe use of a potentially extremely intense psychedelic, should probably stay as far away from this one as possible.

But this is just my opinion.

Thats the type of stigma that surrounds cherum that makes people "scared" of it. Portrayal in modern society plays a fucking HUGE role in availability and enforcement. Shit 25 years ago no one had ever heard of crack and 50 years ago only a few knew the recreational uses of cocaine itself and now look at this mess. And you really wouldnt want to get dusted and fuck somone up. How the fuck would that make you look just in the eyes of society like above? "Man ingests Phencyclidine (PCP) and Goes on Murderous Spree" Yeah you'd be pretty fucked.


I havent seen dust here in Alaska for about 2 years it never was common place but somone ordered like 12 pounds (5 ki's?) from china. I'm pretty sure most of it was destroyed or distributed to the native villages around here. Which goes back to the social stigma thats been brought up in this thread before, what the fuck are some indiginous people who dont even drink liquor (They have "dry" villages) and pay 40 dollars for a joint (Thats no exaduration, half the drug smuggling money in Alaska is bringing it in, the other bigger half is smuggling it to dry villages) How are they going to handle such a powerful dissassiotive? They cant. And there's no way you can mentally prepare yourself for something like that if you havent even abused the DXM in cough syrup(Which is also banned in dry villages along with mouth wash)?


You have to have a certain mentality and demeaner to be truly mentally prepared for any psychadelic/dissassioative. It is a shame that it isnt passed around and more previlent in drug circles. Its also a shame that it isnt a drug (EDIT) known* for purity/quality i.e Weed, Coke, Crys

Er...coke is known for its purity/quality? On the subject of purity, how can you compare these powders with a plant substance like weed anyway


I am very intrigue with the "drug trade" in Alaska. I know that in North West Territories, pot can be like 100 bucks a gram. But are you sure about the sober natives? Not to be racist, but the idea of a "dry" aboriginal village is simply ridiculous this side of the border.

**PCP rage.**


I'm curious as to what causes pcp rage, What exactly spawns that rage? I wouldn't think the user would be aware of what he/she were doing. Is it somthing people are aware of having and just can't controll? Is it somthing people are not aware they are doing? What spawns this rage? I've heard that it stops the mind from realising you're muscles are at there limit, but that still doesn't tell me what exactly causes it. Does anyone here on BL know the answer to this question? Any answers to this question would be much appreciated, thanks. ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

I think you are putting far too much faith in common rumors and misconceptions. Pcp is amazing and euphoric, and does not cause nearly as many violent incidents as the dea and police and dare (or whatever the fuck they call it now) want people think it does.

What exactly causes pcp rage, why do people tend to act violent on it? I've been told it keeps the brain from realising when you're muscles hit their limit, but that still doesn't explain why you'd be angry in some of you're bad pcp trips.

I smoked pcp a few times in the form of sherm stick, basically cigarettes dipped in liquid PCP.  I dont know what the pcp is mixed with but the shit smells rank.  The dose is also unknown so it isnt the best method IMO.  The high was just about as nasty as the smell.


The thing that worries me is that people say it is formaldehyde.  I know that isnt true but Im scared some idiot will actually sell someone a cigarette with some random chemical.  I mixed pcp with ketamine once and I was way too high.  I much prefer an IM shot of ketamine and my one experience with DXM was better than my pcp experiences.  I more or less smoked pcp just to be able to scratch it off the list.


I dont see where all the horror stories come from honestly but I also dont see where any hype comes from.  If I had pcp in the pure form I might experiment with it but otherwise I will stay away.  I dont have anything against pcp though and if you are interested, just try it.

I tried PCP a few times when I was younger and would do any kind of drug that came around. I was in N.Y and some of my friends would go down to the ghetto to score drugs and some times come back with a bag of “dust”. It would come in a dime bag and it was probably like a ½ gram of mint leaves soaked in PCP. People would mix it with pot and smoke it. A dime bag would get 3or4 people looped or 2 people completely looped.  

It was a floating feeling/cheap head rush like being underwater the visuals were strange almost like hyperventilating. It felt like sniffing gas or something but it lasted like 5 hrs. Very ghetto stuff.. Very unclean high. I wouldn’t do it again. 

If you like Maddog wine and smoking crack you might find it interesting.

**my thoughts on pcp use**


Angel dust so often appears in American inner city ghettos because a lot of it is produced by black gangs, namely the Bloods and Crips. I hear Los Angeles is the PCP capital, the place where these gangs produce it the most. On the Eastcoast Washington D.C. and Philly are known for having the most PCP. PCP also has a following in Canada where biker gangs such as the Hell's Angels sell it. I heard supposedly they try to sell it to unsuspecting gullible young kids telling them it's "Mesc" (I'm assuming they're implying it's Mescaline...). I heard the bikers sell it in powder form and cut it with a bunch of sugars. In America these days it's often sold in liquid form in vials, bottles or cigarettes dipped in it (Kool is a brand commonly used for this and Shermans used to be). A really disturbing trend is more and more dealers mixing their liquid PCP with embalming fluid. Kid goes to the dealer and asks for PCP and instead gets sold either a mixture of PCP and fluid or straight up fluid (they call this stuff "wet"). 


Now as to why does PCP make folks violent? I'd say a lot of these people are very confused and frightened by everything going on in their heads and around them and if they end up in a public place around sober folks these strangers are creeped out by them and treat them as if they're crazy and violent and sometimes a PCP intoxicated person might eventually become violent because strangers pushed him to this. A good example of this is how cops sometimes treat PCP heads. Cops have been known to immediately get aggressive with a suspect if they think the person's on PCP. They get in the guy's face and yell at him and bully him and put their hands on him, and big suprise the guy might then actually get violent. Gee I wonder why.... If you guys want to see really fun videos of people on PCP type PCP into youtube.com's search engine....LOL

On another popular forum site there's a recipe circulating to make a PCP related drug called 4-Methoxy-PCP. Supposedly the materials used to make it or cheap and easy to get and the synthesis isn't too hard. Thought some of the more daring curious folks out there might be interested.

From what I've read PCP is most common on the west coast (especially Cali) and places like Washington DC, Philadelphia and New York City on the east coast. But I don't see why one would want to risk trying it these days when supposedly nowadays it's commonly cut with embalming fluid...

Well it's not a very difficult drug to synth whatsoever.  I don't think there are any "Owsley Stanley"s in the PCP business, y'know?  They just want to turn a profit asap and it just so happens that, probably due largely to government propaganda, PCP is most popular in the ghettoes, and it makes sense that it'd be sold there.


Besides most people don't seem to find it to be a revelatory psychedelic.  They take it to get fucked up, just like a lot of dxm and ket users (I know: not all), and it does the job very well.  It provides a dissociation from reality, a feeling of being separate from everything, which would appeal to impoverished people.


To be honest it sounds a lot like an extremely strong weed high to me.  I live in Central VA so once in a blue moon somebody will have a vial (I've only seen them three times) from Washington DC, but I was always scared to try it because it's so easy to cut fluid in a vial.  Besides that there are a lot of retarded-ass people who literally smoke formaldehyde because they get their slang terms all confused, and I've heard several stories (granted they're unverifiable) of people selling embalming fluid as PCP because they think they're the same thing.

Some dudes on forums made 5-Methoxy-PCP sound as if it's one of the simpler of the PCP's to synthesize. I've noticed there's a buncha dissociatives closely related to PCP that supposedly have occasionally shown up on the street (PCE, TCE, PCPy, TCP, etc.) I wonder how the effects of these differ from PCP. Then there's always Tiletamine and MK-801...Though no one on here seems to dabble in those. It's hilarious to me that supposedly for decades black street gangs and biker gangs have been some of the biggest producers of angel dust. I guess it makes sense that it would be very lucrative for them and this might also suggest dust isnt that hard to make. Dust mostly originates in Los Angeles right? Crazy shit. Wonder how many celebs fuck with it.

I dont see how you could mix it with formaldehyde and still have it be smokeable, anyone smelled that stuff!? Doesnt really smell much but about a second after sniffing it burns like a motherfucker. Kinda like ammonia but with a more gradual onset.

TRUST ME herb spiked with formeldahyde can be smoked. I've met many characters who experimented with it and some of THE wildest descriptions of their  experiences on it. True hallucinations and delusions. Kinda deliriant esque with the confusion of Vitamin K. Oh and by the way even smoking fluid a few times can make you feel permanently fried and with parts of your brain barely working again. Heard of it happening to people. They end up being in and out psych wards for yrs and unable to care for themselves. Basically having made themselves retarded spaced out senile whatever u want to call it. Shrinks have told me embalming fluid patients are some of the absolute hardest to treat and don't even necessarily respond to even good psychiatric drugs like mood stabilizers, anti-psychotics, etc (and I know all mood stabs and anti-psychs aren't "good" but the newer generation of them can be pretty damn good such as Seroquel.

Well I tried it last night not to long after making my post about pcp, and wow I'm still feeling pretty werid right now. It was a super intense mindfuck that's for sure and I really can't say I'd ever do it again, to each his own.


The shit we got was in small jar like thing with a yellow lid. Stuff smelled REALLY REALLY strong, not bad just super strong. We dipped cigarettes in it, and one of the people with me dipped a joint in it.

**getting wet.**


So, I managed to get my self a fry stick. I've always wanted to try getting wet. But now that I have this ugly, brown, stained, phencyclidine dipped cigarette in my hands, I look at it, and then I chicken out.


I know that the chances of going batshit insane are quite small. (and I've gone on some hard core tweek binges, which can also lead to batshit insanity)


But for some reason, I cant muster up that "I think rangrz is a pretty cool guy. Eh smokes PCP and doesnt afraid of anything" attitude and just spark it up.


for one thing, I dont really know what a decent starter dose is. Can anyone suggest this to me? How many puffs? I've done Ketamine via injection, and done DXM. So I know the Disassocitive feeling/experience.


can anyone give me some good PCP stories(good as in enjoyable, and not invovling murdering your girlfriend with a rake and wearing her skin around) and a sugggested to dosage to get my courage up?

Merged in a question about PCP.  This thread doesn't see the light of day much, so please forgive it if I can't answer your questions.  But I'm sure someone will have something useful for you. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I've noticed there's a buncha dissociatives closely related to PCP that supposedly have occasionally shown up on the street (PCE, TCE, PCPy, TCP, etc.) I wonder how the effects of these differ from PCP. Then there's always Tiletamine and MK-801...Though no one on here seems to dabble in those. It's hilarious to me that supposedly for decades black street gangs and biker gangs have been some of the biggest producers of angel dust. I guess it makes sense that it would be very lucrative for them and this might also suggest dust isnt that hard to make. Dust mostly originates in Los Angeles right? Crazy shit. Wonder how many celebs fuck with it.

tiletamine... known on the circut as "crystal T" great great stuff!!!! also pretty easy to get. its a wonder why I havent aquire it in large quanities and destroyed my sel yet. 


I have this joint I bought for 30 bucks from a mexican in northern virginia (its actualy still there) supposivly saturated in pcp. Iv yet to try it because I wasnt in the mood when I bought it and then things fell through with who I was seeing there and it ahs remained there for the last few weeks. when I finally dust off I'll post a trip report. as Iv said my brother LOVES PCP. so I'll see what all teh fuss is about. the joint was ment to be split between 4 people I was told.

my brother says just smoke it till you ahve reached effects. a small dose wil be kinda weird body high and slight dissosiation while medium to high doses wil be marked by psychedelia and blurred vision with a strong sense of dissisosiation.

We have no way of recommending a dosage when we don't know the quantity you have or its purity. From what I've heard PCP potency can vary a LOT. Since in its pure form it's such a potent drug on a per milligram basis it's perfect to cut the hell out of it with filler. 


If we're to believe the DEA supposedly most PCP originates in labs on the Westcoast in Cali where black gangs (Crips, etc) produce it and move it through distribution networks across the nation. So I'd assume by the time PCP hits the Eastcoast it is far, far weaker and cut with who knows what (hopefully just innocent stuff like Lactose, Mannitol, etc).


Is it at all true that biker gangs are some of the main sellers of PCP in Canada and that there it is often called "Mesc" or "Mess" and passed off to naive people as Mescaline?


And why do I never hear mention of PCP in the Eastern Hemisphere?

so i took one big drag from it and held it for 30 seconds. I still feel kind of high, buts its starting to wear down. (about 45 minutes ago I did this.) It was really chill IMHO. I just felt disassociated from my bdoy, really calm and relaxed and I did nothing but sit on my couch and veg out. I like it. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) no real hallucinations or anything. Still feel kind of "drunk" intoxicated. Overall, it was different then anything I've treid before, but still had some similarities to ketamine and DXM. Dont really know how to explain it.


I should note I took it with a bar of xanax, which probably accounts for the really mellow high that I have.

Pure crystal PCP is not a horrible drug, but there's not much of a dosage difference between heavy dissociation and sheer terror.  High doses can, and do, cause amnesia of the experience.

Why would the effects of a smoked hit wear off in 45 minutes?  I thought PCP had an extremely long duration even if smoked. I've heard of people being loaded and spaced out on it for a very long time; sometimes even the next day. You should get a piss testing kit to see if you even test positive for PCP. What you had could have mostly or entirely been cut or another drug.


The cities on the Eastcoast that I've heard mention of having PCP in are: Philadelphia, DC, NYC and NJ.


I wonder how often PCP is laced with Embalming Fluid or pure Embalming Fluid is passed off as PCP. I find that trend disturbing and wish dealers would stop doing that. What the hell do the two drugs have in common effects wise anyway? And you PCP users, you don't worry that if you buy liquid PCP that it could have fluid mixed in?

I've had a couple of experiences with a strange-looking batch of PCP. [Here is a report on my experience with it.](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/showthread.php?t=217496).


It is very inferior to Ketamine. Worth trying for the novelty, but it is not something I'd give to someone who hasn't had experience with several drugs before.

I got a lot of euphoria from PCP at the beginning almost like from coke and then i started to hallucinate and heared conversations that didn't exist and heared music and vivid colors and trek lights in my living room where moving with the music but at the end like after 8 hours or more I got a lot of paranoia. that was mine first and only experience with PCP and I didn't smoke it ,it was a powder

pcp is definitely one of my favorite drugs. I don't understand the bad rap it always gets. Funny how people are quick to point out the bullshit propaganda about weed and other drugs but still believe that pcp will make you go insane and eat people. I have never freaked out on sherm, nor have any of the many friends i have who have tried it.


however, after smoking it nonstop every day for a month, it does start to mess with you....

I was referring to the idea that your friends dealer spend money on PCP just to throw it in his weed. The more likely story is that your friend freaked out after smoking some potent buds.

The only time i tried PCP, it was from Montreal. And for some reason the fucked up east coast slang they call is "mesc" or even "mescaline". The dealer was trying to tell me that PCP and mescaline are the same drug. knowing a great deal about drugs this just got me so mad. But damn i didnt want to start an arugment over something so stupid. So he sold me a .1 of yellow gummy powder. At first i was confused thinking it maybe was mescaline, because it looked so pure,  yellow moist crystals. I thought if this is PCP it cant be pure or that would be a fucking HUGE DOSE. 100mgs..lol wow. But on the other hand 100mgs of mescaline is nothing...soo i tried it anyway.lol. DEFF PCP..lol wow. That dose was like 10 times to high. I could have prolly gotten high of that .1 ten times..literally. My buddy got some later on to and did some and i found out he gave him like 1/3 the amount i had and he told him to take half of that. I dunno if the guy just wanted to kill me , or just wanted me to get fucked out of  my mind because i pissed him off telling him PCP is not mescaline. Anyway after about 4 hours passed i started to like the high. I just hated feeling like im past the K-hole for 4 hours..like fuck.


Overall i got tricked into taking way way to much.( maybe he hated me because i was so english to.. he knew i was an Ontario boy)  My buddy who did 1/6th of what i did said he felt a little to high of that dose to..LOL 


I think the guy just had some pure shit and didnt realize what kind of dose a  newbie should take. Prolly a fucking sherm head with no brain.


ohh yeah and for the record, i smoked half in a bulb and snorted the other half.

I heard when the chemicals were around. It was way way simple.  Like in the  late 60's early 70s it was much more easy to make PCP then meth..

oh yes, one of my old loves in the world. I haven't smoked it in a good 3 years but there once was a time maybe about 7-8 years ago, I smoked it like it were weed. Before school, right after school, before work, during work break, after work, before bed. TBH after about several months like that, I couldn't smoke it anymore. I'd love to have a little taste. I actually love the taste and smell of it.![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif)

Ahhh, Phencyclidine, how I miss thee.


If I had a nickel for everytime I have had to pause and correct some knucklehead by telling him: no he did not smoke embalming fluid, no I am not going to help you break into a funeral home, embalming fluid/loveboat is just a term for pcp, etc., I would be rich.

I grew up right outside New York City in the 1980s, and-as the Beastie Boys rapped about on many a track-dust was everywhere.


For a good 2 years+, I smoked it every day. That shit is heavy duty...best description: it has the potential to do  what Nancy Reagan and all her cronies warned everyone about (violence, hallucinations that, unlike lsd, are very real, and many other mindfucks).


I know, I know, an inanimate item can't be evil, but pcp sure as fuck comes close. If you want more detailed info, pm me. Btw, happy to say I haven't done dust in 15+ years. Sadly, I probably would do it again-damn evil dust ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Just for the record, Embalming fluid, formaldehyde, is being used as a drug today.  Usually called "fry," it's weed or oregano laced with formaldehyde and usually smoked in cigarette form.


There are lots of reports of it's use is reputable journals.  Not that it's brilliant.

I love splitting a dust blunt with a friend. Then smoking a fat blunt of piff with them too. The dust hits you like 1/4 way through the blunt. By the end of the blunt of trees you are so wet it ain't no joke. I wouldn't advise anyone to be around anyone that is against hard drugs cuz they will obviously see your stupid.

Funny how people are quick to point out the bullshit propaganda about weed and other drugs but still believe that pcp will make you go insane and eat people. I have never freaked out on sherm, nor have any of the many friends i have who have tried it.

LMFAO! AHAHA that video somebody posted on page 1 ([http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDBofgWP5fM)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDBofgWP5fM)). Omg i can't stop laughing, if you go to 3:10 in the video, you're sure to get a laugh. Best part is when the doctor is being interviewed and in the background you hear the dude yelling once more "YOUU CAHHHH-RAAAAAYYYYYy-zeeeeeeee."


"Do you know what it is that you took?"

"RAHHHHHH!!!!"


Phew. To say the least, I'm still looking forward more to trying ketamine than I am pcp.

Definitely not as extreme as Big Lurch, but I know a guy who broke both his hands beating up a statue he said was talking shit to him while on PCP.


Oh, and where does the second 'P' come from if it is "phencyclidine?"

The full chemical name of PCP is phenylcyclohexylpiperidine.

True, I just think its a shame that just because a few mentally ill rappers (Houston and Big Lurch) went nuts that its scared people off from a great drug.

I'm in the same boat.  I've done PCP but no idea on the dose as it was slipped to me.  I’d like to give it a few tries but stories like these kind of freak me out.  I can sort of see how these things are possible but it's a long stretched.  For me PCP was like being really really really really baked only I didn't want to devour the fridge and I wasn't tired as shit.  Everything was just really bizarre, confusing, I felt lost, and was extremely disassociated to the point I really had to focus on walking.

also, it is neurotoxic, so it would be a good idea to keep doses low and lifetime use to a minimum.

Suppose I should have actually read about PCP before asking.


How does the neurotoxicity compare to say MDMA or Methamphetamine?

well, from consulting my toxicology book, i'd say that it seems like it isn't nearly as bad as methamphetamine, or even MDMA. all it says it that it caused *in vivo* apoptosis (cell death) of the frontal cortex in mice. really, you'd have to look up the general toxicity of NMDA antagonists.


the one thing i do know is that it is more neurotoxic than ketamine, since ketamine is a mixed agonist/antagonist and PCP is pure antagonist. some ketamine plus PCP might mitigate the neurotoxic effects.

if ketamine is like a "virtual reality" pcp is a super chaotic reality scrambler IME however it can be quite amazing, it's not always so confusing but I'd say more often then not, however while i'd say K is more fun, pcp is way more euphoric


they mosdef go great together tho

PCP is an extremely potent psychedelic , here in new jersey it is readily available buy the vial , which is a single dose . I find one dose just gives you threshold effects . I usually smoke 3 for the full blown trip . You have to be careful though one time a buddy and me smoked 10 vials between us and I didnt come down for 7 days . The first 2 days were extremely visual and scary almost . After the first 2 days it felt like i was acid for 5 days straight . Not an ideal situation when you have to goto work . Be careful and have fun .

I too had heard that PCP is neurotoxic, but it seems like any psychoactive drug is under the right conditions. What I wonder is, has anyone noticed any long term problems after discontinuing PCP use? Is it any worse than the afereffects from ketamine?


I was also wondering if anyone has used low doses of PCP for depression, as a social lubricant, etc., the way low doses of ketamine are popularly used?


Finally, has anyone seen a study of the structure-activity relationship for dissociatives they can point me to?

pcp is a GREAT social lubricant on low or post doses, probably one of the best IMHO. Interestingly pcp is supposed to be more neurotoxic especially street wet cause of what it's cut with but IME from what I've seen heavy ketamine users are much worse off than "wet patients" in terms of how shot they act.

gash PCP is scary shitttt

i got dosed with it one time and it freaked me out indefinitely!


kept me off weed for a while too!


It made me feel as if i didn't exist.

It was like in those movies when you wish something and then some dude takes you to show you what it would be like if that wish came true and you can see yourself and everyone else but they cant see or hear you.


** for the record it was actually PCP laced weed. A friend of mine dipped it when he got it and then gave it to us so this isnt just assumption after having crazy ghetto weed **


strong smell of chemicals and shit

you'd know if you got it

but its not exactly common unless you actually buy it. PCP laced things are hard to come across

thats all i recommend.


you will feel beyond fucked up. i have done acid twice (two tabs the first time and three the second) and over 50 shroom trips.


they dont even touch pcp. youre lucky if you dont get caught under the influence of pcp by a stranger or cop.


if you want to know how much it makes you hallucinate lets just say it makes you hallucinate way more than acid.

its actually over rated in that aspect but say if like a cop comes up to you and starts grabbing you when you are on it. you will definitely start to get violent. it depends on the surroundings. some surrounding while under the influence may bring you back to a terrible memory and you might want to just punch it in.


i remember when i was on it all i did was just sit on my friends couch at a party thinking how fucked i was. i went outside and it seemed like i made it to the end of his yard in 2 seconds. and i yelled at my ex girlfriend and her new boyfriend all the things i ever wanted to. they knew i was fucked up and just let it be.

Yeah, down here in Houston it is a problem. I used to buy regs from this guy and one time something was off after my first hit. I was slightly drunk so I figured "fuck it" and smoked a little more. The first thing I remember is turning my head to talk and the world followed me about 5 seconds later. All feeling in my body subsided, similar to high DXM dose but there was  no "spinning". The world takes on a different hue, like a purple/blue.The only thing I could do was lay down in the bed to look at the VERY boring CEV's.Half-assed patterns that were gone before I could watch them.  I would rather take Bromo Dragon Fly than this shit. TERRIBLE.

I used to smoke PCP all the time a few years ago and it was alot of fun for awhile . Its very intense at times when you take heavy doses. Ive smoked it for days straight at a time and became a bit delusional after awhile. The last time I used PCP i smoked about 10 vials and got stuck in the trip for a whole week. It felt great honestly but towards the last few days it kinda freaked me out because I thought I was going to be stuck like that forever. Be very careful with this stuff its extremely powerful. Its pretty easy to get if you live in Jersey. Camden is loaded with the stuff and its usually of outstanding quality   :D

Have to say I'm very intrigued by all the controversy around PCP, as has been said before it is shrouded in mystery because of the warped target audience, the unquestionably unilateral and downright ignorant reactions of authorities and the prevalence of adulterants.

I feel like we all owe truth or something, not to advise people to start trying this stuff but I'd like it if someone were to clear up the reasons for the bad rap: how harmful is pure PCP and are freakouts minimal in experienced educated users instead of like ghetto bums? It's all so entangled, no wonder it scares people off. Scary rumors thats one thing but it staying uncertain doesn't help either.

Hmmm don't know what exactly would help but a crude indication of the neurotoxicity being less than with MDMA (!) I find interesting. So how long are side-effects on cognition etc. apparent? How reversible does it seem to be with occasional use?

an interesting comparison, like BR-DFLY with acid, a whole slew of unexpected undesirable weed experiences are* assumed *to be PCP. how many people have told you they smoked PCP? i know about 20 different people have told me they smoked weed "laced with something" which is assumed to be PCP, I'm sure they were all just high. like heroin or coke laced MDMA rolls, PCP laced weed does not make much economic sense. from what i hear wet cigarettes cost something like ten dollars each, much to valuable to use as a cut. are people forgetting weed is VERY psychoactive in its own right?


its like that study that demonstrated a huge number of girls who thought they were slipped a roofie, were just really drunk.


that said im sure everyone here who intentionally smoked PCP got what they were sold, and probs some of you got laced weed, but im sure the vast majority just smoked good weed.

Ah I'd like some info on that roofie-study please even though its not the topic ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

It must be pretty much the same for GHB, since it's not the point what drug was

used but the claim that people get something slipped. I'm part of a drug informing

unit giving out objective information about use at like techno parties, we don't

judge and are very much behind awareness.

If you know anything about that study let me know.


Not too long ago a female housemate friend of mine joined me and some others

going out and she'd had a few to drink. Suddenly she offers me this glass and

tells me it tastes funny it might contain GHB. Now judging by the volume of deep

red liquor and the totally normal taste I really didn't think so. But she insisted and

bought another one to compare. Again I could not notice a difference, it should have

been supersalty and less coloured for it to have any significant amount of ghb in it.

Though wishing there were something enjoyable in there i chugged the thing, damn

I hated to have been right the first time. ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)

People should hold theirselves accountable and not defy occams razor because of incidental gossip stories blown up immensely by the media, jeez. Also, don't underestimate a high GHB dose or (I gather as much), PCP. It has to be some special experience for it to be a lacing or spiking job. Unfortunately you can drink not much at all and get drunk off yer tits but you rarely hear about those without people proclaiming it had to have been something else.


It's like every poor genetic mutant roaming the street is suddenly an alien when sighted. That way alien stories and other urban legends become usual, but when you see an actual mutated patient it startles you ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)

I apologise for the tangent offtopicness its a fluke.

I don't understand this concept myself.  

Unless batches are simply made and misplaced/confused.

Something tell me though that laced nuggs would smell as chemical as the dipped smokes, no?

PCP stinks you would definetly know something was up with the bud . When you open a vial you can smell it a few feet away. And it tastes metallic and chemically. I L![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif)

yes the incredibly strong smell - thats another thing ive heard about as well, more evidence that all your friends who tripped ballz on angel dust were probs just high on good weed and being pharmacological drama queens.


here is the date rape study linked off the wikipedia flunitrazepam entry

Anyone know how the effects of PCP analogs like PCE, PCPy, TCE, 4-Meo-PCP, etc compare to PCP?


I assume one of the reasons some PCP is much dirtier than other batches is the presence of toxic analogs and contaminants.


Anyone know whether the Los Angeles Crips and Quebec Hell's Angels still make and sell PCP?

I've done PCP before and going to try ketamine tonight hopefully for the first time...


I would think ketamine is way lighter than PCP. PCP at low doses is probably a little more intense than k holing...okay maybe not. But k holing doesn't match that big dose of PCP where you flip out.


I was a drunk idiot I could smell the funny scent on the cigarette and just took the whole thing anyway as my friends were laughing. So messed up. At least I got it for free though, it seems pretty cheap. I'm never doing it again. At high doses I've heard of people ending up with a life change or convulsing. If you think shrooms messes with your emotions, do not do this.

**Pcp**


There is only one time that comes to my mind when SWIM thinks of "using PCP". SWIM had bought two blotters from a friend and were said to be "LSD (double hits)". well SWIM had bought two of them at $20 a pop and taken both of them at one time and about a half hour later shared a bowl of bud with that same friend. When 60mins. of ingestion happened, SWIM was feeling very spaced out like rele baked, feeling. SWIM did in fact have strong Open eye visuals and auditory hallucinations. (Moving patterns in the sky, blurry-like vision, Echoing...etc.) Depth and Preception was off...everything was far away or felt very close. The Body high was amazing for the first few hours b4 peak. SWIM does remember having like "Black-outs" and being like where the fuck am i (during Peak). SWIM had slurred speech, as if SWIM was to have been drinking heavily. SWIM's motor skills were of a little. SWIM had to concentrate on walking straight. SWIM could not think...Literally. The MOST DEAD GIVE AWAY WAS THAT SWIM's SKIN WAS NUMB. SWIM had an idea that this was most likely a dissosiactive(sp.)...or PCP. Mind you SWIM has never dun PCP, Ketamine,....or DXM for that matter! SWIM did not feel like being violent or aggressive. SWIM was too fucked up to even bother wanting to fight lol So all in all SWIM would say it was a pretty pleasant trip. SWIM had read all about LSD trips and was ready for that kind of trip so it worked out pretty well.


I would say that the after effects do Lingre on weeks, even months after a single use. SWIM still has disorganized thinking from time to time after that one dose. hopefully this didn't discourage anyone from trying it. the trip did infact last 12-14 hours...NO LIE! Don't have any idea how much was given since it was on blotter.


Sorry for all the "SWIM's".


This experienced happened close to a year from today.

No need to be sorry for the SWIMs - just don't use them cos they don't provide any legal protection and make posts annoying to read ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


Are you sure it wasn't just the acid (maybe high dose tabs) and weed that were causing you to trip? PCP has a very strong, distinctive chemical taste from all I've heard so you'd probably no as soon as you smoked the weed cos it would taste like smoking chemical. I've never had it but if it's anything like the taste of 3-MeO-PCP it's definitely very distinctive and you'd know if you smoked any instantly.


EDIT: Doh! Just reread your post and you're saying you think it was the blotter that was doses with PCP not the weed, I think (confused by all the SWIMming, see ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)). I've not heard of PCP blotter but it could probably be dosed that way, I'd think. Would imagine it would have to be a comparatively large blotter though and would still have tasted of chemical rather than just paper.


Glad you enjoyed it without having any problems whatever it was though. All good trips are good trips even the unknown chemical ones, but does go to show that you really need to be able to trust your source. I wouldn't be too happy if someone sold me something as acid if it wasn't. Probably wouldn't complain too much if I still got a good trip out of it though :D

**Fuck it**


Just tried this shit a week ago.....I guess you'd like it if you were that kid back in elementary school that was constantly getting sent to the deans office for smelling markers and passing yourself out.


Horrible high for me, for most of it. All in all I didn't like it. My head hurt like shit for hours after wards, I could not get to sleep, and I hear it's not that safe either (hah). Kids and scumbag dealers are fucking this stuff up more and more everyday. Cutting it with more bullshit. If your gunna use, do it in a safe environment, maybe home (if you don't live wit mommy n daddy of course), and have a baby-sitter (preferably not your 15 year old little brother).


Good luck ya'll

I was also told how they don't put it on herb like kind bud or even mids but they'll put it on schwag or Mex brickweed or really shitty herb.


I've also heard of people putting PCP on other herbal leaves like stuff that isn't even pot.

I've always been morbidly curious about PCP ever since I was sure I had an experience with dusted weed one time. Hear me out, I've smoked high-potency strains all my life so I know my weed, but this seemed exactly like some shwag that had been soaked in something that smelled like shoe polish or varnish. Upon smoking I immediately remarked on the liquidy menthol taste, something I wasn't expecting from such low-grade bud... What ensued was complete insanity, an experience I'll never forget. I was so incredibly dissociated and uncoordinated I still can't believe I managed to get from my garage into my basement. As I walked the boundaries between the wall and myself would sometimes blur and I'd find myself suddenly pressed up against it to keep my balance, it felt like I was constantly falling off the edge of the world. Doing normal human things like making food or eating seemed to be an impossible maze, until my hands magically did their thing.

some friends of mine traveled to montreal in high school. pcp was very prevalent, and almost uniformly referred to as 'mesc' or even 'mescaline', but the impression was that users were well aware that the drug was pcp, and these were simply accepted slang terms. it was usually sold as either a green paste (which would be applied to the roof of the mouth or gums - yup roof of the mouth was a popular ROA, or smoked) or a brown/tannish powder.

I've heard the same about the "mesc" in Montreal, it's a phenomenon that is deeply unsettling to me... and anecdotally I've heard that yes holding in the mouth/sublingually is an effective way of administering PCP. Imagine the surprise of a long-term mesc/PCP user upon getting a cap of pure mescaline or random 2C-X! I don't know why dealers need to misrepresent the chemicals they sell, it leads to such confusion and possibly even dangerous situations.

It is pretty silly, I mean the only similarities between the two (mescaline and PCP) are their duration. They can also both produce deep visions that can be hard to discern from reality while under the influence. But the mechanism in which it happens is totally different, ie. the psychedelic dissolution of the ego and consensus reality vs. PCP's dissociation. I really think that if called by the proper name and used appropriately, phencyclidine can be a useful tool.


There's one report on Erowid that mentions this phenomenon: 


[http://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=13798](http://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=13798)


It's worth noting that it's mostly the Hells Angels and other biker gangs that are involved in the manufacture and distribution of PCP in Quebec. This in particular makes me a very sad panda ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)

That's one of the better PCP reports I've read. Sounds like how I imagine it to be and fits with my small experience of 3-MeO-PCP pretty well too. Except there's no mention of euphoria which I also associate (without experience) with PCP and know (with experience) is there in spades with 3-MeO-PCP. I still have an itch that needs scratching...

Unless you know the drugs concentration in the liquid you cannot calculate dosage.

One of the many risks of unpure, street PCP.

A good method would be to start small and build your way up, treat it as any other new drug.

**PCP- Your Thought's and Stories?**


Just wanted to know if anyone else has any encounters to share with the liquid form phencyclidine. I myself will tell you this. 

I have not touched it since sometime early 2009, somewhat because of availability and for it's bad qualities. 

I first tried it in a little green $30 bottle, around here there were $20's and $30's with colors of green amber and clear. The $30's were the economical choice with almost 2x the $20's amount of what we call Water in my town. I have smoked good quality stuff somewhere from 3-5 times, and the bunk stuff 2 or 3 times. 

The high is unlike anything i can describe, smoking the dip tastes like spraypaint and a bunch of chemicals mixed together at first, but after a few times i gained a acquired taste to it. Somewhere in between halfway through the cig i will start feeling a little faded, major distortion and way fucked up perception, time perception my first time was more then i have ever experienced in my life. PCP is one of the weirdest drugs and to a non user of it sounds probably plain weird as fuck. It gives me a feeling of where my brain is in the sky with my body doing things on earth but almost in another world type of feeling. Sorry if this is long but i am interested to see what other's say.

PCP is my favorite dissociative, although when i used it i used it less than dxm and ketamine. i haven't used it since 07 though because of lack of access (although i haven't really looked.) there's not much of it around in MA. the interesting thing about pcp compared to dxm and k is dust sometimes got me hyped up like i was on coke along with the dissociation.


i always had a blast, there was one time i had a "incredible hulk/COPS episode" pcp experience though.

i was at a necro (the rapper) show at the middle east in boston. i had drank a full pint of vodka to the face and then went outside and smoked a dip. i got incredibly high as pcp always gets me and shortly after i blacked out and woke up in a psych ward.

my friend who was there told me i was running around in circles yelling "i love pcp" and punching myself in the face, and throwing elbows here and there and people. then i went outside and sat down in the middle of the street stopping traffic. a cop picked me up and took me to the hospital.


i blame the mix of vodka and dust for the incident, pcp alone never made me wig out.

This is what i don't get, i never get any crazy feeling's and am more fucked up. however drinking even a few beers or shots while high of a stick would have me in a stuck high all day almost..

It was also my favorite dissociative, i have never tried ketamine but dxm gives me a way weaker feeling of how PCP gets me.

dude the shit is insane to me. it makes me feel connected to mother earth and shit.   Its like this to me   pcp is like a wooden roller coaster      dxm is like a  water slide (like blizard beach in florida)  and ketamine is the metal roller coasters.   


and they all involve a "hole" or stuck whatever

**long term effects**


somebody asked about the long-term effects of pcp so i wanted to add my experience.


i was addicted to it hardcore for about a year. i was in pretty big denial of its actual "addictive" qualities (in comparison to drugs like cocaine and opiates, i also had problems drugs like that) but i think my denial was part of the addiction itself. it was a drug i used for about 10 years, but only occasionally... i had "loved it" and binged on it as a teenager and then only used it a couple times a year up until about 2 years ago.


at first it was the garden variety things, blackouts, injuries, robberies and assaults that happened when i was under the influence. its the type of drug to very easily push yourself over the edge with because the most common method of consumption is smoking and dosage isn't stable with street-grade pcp. also once you are under the influence of pcp it is the type of drug that makes you crave more, and if you have more you will take more... and when that happens all hell can break loose. while i never fried a baby in cooking oil or cut off somebodies face and wore it as a mask, i was incoherent a lot of the time, often being carted off to the hospital because the cops would find my car stopped in the middle of an intersection, or i would be freaking out somewhere. i got involved with undesirable people, gang members... i did live in a "ghetto" area at the time...


it progressively got worse, as time went on. my mental symptoms declined, because when i was sober things were almost as bad as when i was intoxicated, i was just as irrational and psychotic, just not incoherent. i got into a hit and run accident because i thought i was in a video game and my car could just take some damage and keep going. i thought i was invincible and could drive 90 miles per hour and run stop signs and red lights. i didn't think i was doing anything wrong. they say that pcp causes people to have "schizophrenic like behavior" and its a pretty spot on description because my behavior was definitely crazy....... hallucinations, delusions, completely erratic outbursts. eventually i was spending so much time in a blackout state horrific things began to happen to me, i "came to" in the middle of being raped, i was beaten severely, every single time i walked to the spot to score i wound up being carted off to the hospital in an ambulance, and times i would "escape" the emergency room, often to get high again and get hospitalized again...


the whole thing is, for months and months it was almost like i was in a dreamlike state 24/7 and didn't realize what was going on, it wasn't until after i had stopped using the drug entirely that my mind cleared up and i was able to see all the damage that had been done. by then i had lost my husband, my daughter had been taken away temporarily, i crashed my car, i lost my drivers license, and a number of other life changing things had happened to me. but it didn't even "hit me" until i stopped using the drug.


i sobered up completely but it took months for many of the psychotic symptoms to go away, and some have not completely subsided after 6 months clean.


i am not some inexperienced young idiot either. i'm a 28 year old psych major and i used to have a genius IQ. my brain is pretty much fried now, memory wise... although the brain is a wonderful thing and i am able to form new crystallized intelligence, the leftovers are pretty much mush. i'm all for personal freedom and didn't come to harp on anyone for using pcp - i am actually information gathering - but i wanted to share my own experience because its not a drug to be played with, and the long term effects are serious. severe depression, psychosis, memory loss, thought organization - just to name a few.

Actually, I think it did happen to me once, and until I started thinking today, pretty much exactely the other way around. I'm quite sure I had PCP laced weed and at the time figured it was just really good weird weed. Now people can think 'you've never had good weed', but I was born in and still live in Amsterdam. I've smoked hash and weed daily for a good 6 years now. I'm véry familair with being stoned. I'm also experienced with some dissociatives; ketamine and nitrous. A few years back I used to be in the UK a lot, thanks to some friends there I had a good supply of brittish weed. 


One time the weed was exceptionally strange. I'll describe it: it tasted different from regular weed and the first 5 minutes we'd feel nothing, then after 5 minutes it'd suddently kick in. Weed never does that for me, it graduatly comes up from the moment I blow out the smoke. Now this weed which I'll refer to as odd weed from now kicked in after 5 minutes, and from that moment I'd be véry, véry stoned and noticably numb. My vision would be off too, much too dark and far away looking, kind of like nitrous does but without the buzziness that nitrous has on all your senses. 


We soon figured this weird weed was much too strong to smoke in large amounts, but the first night after we got it we didn't know that yet, and smoked quite a few spliffs. What happened was that suddently I couldn't see anything. I was also upside down for some odd reason, or maybe in a 90 degree angle. I wasn't even sure at the time. None of this concerned me to the slightest and I was talking and babbling on like I was feeling completely normal. I remember most of the conversations, even with this being 4 years ago. Now I'm not typically the person to lie upside down with no vision and assume nothing weird is going on. That was also the night we decided we couldn't smoke too much of this stuff or weird things would happen.


These effects have some strong links with ketamine (more then with weed anyway). Most of all the numbness, not feeling your limbs, or even forgetting you have them, then also the forgetting which side is up with eyes closed. Also the actual head feeling was suprisingly similair, and not similair to being stoned. There were also differences to ketamine, for example, on ketamine I'm typically very aware of what a weird state I'm in, its a lot more lucid and I'm just more.. mentally aware of what is happening to me. On the odd weed I don't remember even thinking for one moment about the fact I couldn't see or was virtually upside down. 


I did like the odd weed, and I'm curious to one day try a low dose of PCP to see if that is what it was. I'm pretty sure I'll like it anyway, it sounds comparable but stronger to ketamine, and I like that a lot. I'll probably not come across any for years though and I'm not in a hurry to either. Im just curious to this strong dissociative. I'm wondering if people who did ketamine ánd pcp could tell me how well they compare, because I still hold the posibility this was just really, really weird weed, or that it was laced with something completely unrelated, so any more information is always welcome.

So I've been keeping this experience under my cap for around a year, but I feel like it's time I told the world. Or at least the people who are most likely yo understand me and least likely to judge or doubt me. At around September of last year I went on a dissociative binge, consuming a large quantity of olive-oil sold to me as "CBD" oil, the active constituent in hashish and indica strains of cannabis. But what I experienced was exactly like the reports of oral PCP that I've read, and unlike any cannabinoid. I even experimented with CBD-heavy extracts and found them to be the opposite of this particular batch. I have smoked laced weed before, and before anybody rushes to correct me, I'm an extremely experienced cannabis user and know the difference between the two. This was something different than being blazed off some nice kush for the first time and freaking out. When you smoke a few bongs and get a massive bell-ringer on par with an IM shot of K, and the floor looks ten feet away from you, well there's nothing that does that other than the most angelic of dusts. That's G.O.D. for PCP, my obsession and the one compulsion that made this studied and experienced psychonaut lose complete control.


I bought this oil in the hopes that I would have an alternative to smoking, as I was moving into a new house where it wouldn't be as easy or acceptable to smoke out a window. So as a result I was actively trying to get used to using this in lieu of smoking. What ended up happening was a complete dissociative fugue where I became detached from reality and saw myself from a third person perspective for an extended period. I dosed ~8 oz. of this oil over three weeks and consumed approximately 40mg of PCP, not a large amount, but with what was likely several hundred milligrams of PCC, piperidine, and other lovely contaminates. I was basically non-stop sigma dosing this stuff in the way that one might with Delsym, but with the difference that one teaspoon would make you JUST dis-inhibited enough to take another, and another, before I was so spaced I could barely add up how many I took at the end of the day. At which point I'd break out the K, snort massive lines and dissociate even further. This potentiated the already immensely powerful PCP state into complete cosmic insanity on a scale I can't even comprehend in a sober mind. I was reduced to complete kosmic dust, as Jamshyd and others have put it. The power of the experience filled every last nook and cranny of my mind until there was nothing left but the un-mistakable certainty that I was experiencing the divine with every receptor in my brain and molecule in my body-which was miles away at this point.


People say that PCP has a long longevity in the body and any doses taken the day after had an additive effect, well I can definitely attest to this. There was also the added complication of the inconsistency of orally dosing something this potent, even though I determined after the fact that there was probably 1mg of active PCP for every 5ml, but keep in mind I had 16oz total. I basically watched half of that jar dissapear and my mind go from a mildly depressed and detached state to a complete psychotic mess. It was over before it even began, like I said I lost all control and the damage had been done before I realized what happened. I had all sorts of John Lilly-esque delusions such like thinking an elaborate series of co-incidences was created by some higher mind in order that I access this space and learn it's secrets. I was running down the hallways and passages of my mind with wild abandon, viewing every possible alternate reality, generally acting like a child in some kind of absurd existential candy store. These incredibly elaborate mind movies would take over and I'd live entire lives in them, exploring the complete surreality in a real way I can only describe as delusional. Unfortunately while my mind was in the clouds my body was being absolutely punished as I was on an incredibly restrictive diet as another kind of self-experiment.


I started taking it on September 21st 2009 and binged heavily until October 7th, which seemed to pass in the blink of an eye. When I came to I knew I had fucked up in an epic way, and considering I was experiencing a kind of induced schizophrenic state I knew I had to stop as soon as possible. I had to wean myself off of it for several days, and ended up zonking myself out on Seroquel and Epival for a week or so to avoid the inevitably mind-crushing withdrawals. This was a bad choice, as the longevity of something like that in your body is immense, especially in someone with a weakened digestive system. Even though I was heavily sedated on quetiapine I was basically still under the influence of the much more powerful PCP. I couldn't take the dose of quell that would have held my dopamine receptors otherwise my body would have likely shut down, so I could only attenuate the state and make it marginally more bearable. I have a reduced seizure threshold because of this, as the combo of a sedating anti-psychotic and phencyclidine is known to produce. I also have a great "second skeleton" of bizzare tardive-diskinesia-esque muscular movements that I can control, but for a time was involuntary and seemed necessary in order to channel the psychotic level of energies I felt surging through me.


It seemed ironic that this was during a bit of a PCP renaissance here on BL when new analogues like 3-MeO and 4-MeO PCP and PCE were appearing on the scene. I wish I could have experienced this in a more measured way, with known doses of pure research-grade chemicals like are available now. But no, I had to go and trust a source that could barely spell in our communication. There was every sign that there was something wrong with this batch, it had a musty, fishy smell that if added to a solvent would be exactly like the varnish-like smell that this stuff is known for. It cost a pittance compared to what I now know it would take to make that much of a real CBD extract. Aside from hash or indica weed there's no way to even GET pure CBD, and it's apparantly the non-psychoactive part of cannabis anyways. Than again, if you're going to try and pass something off as a non-psychoactive cannabinoid that can only potentiate weed, what better than a diluted dissociative? At lower levels the buzz was fairly cannabis like, and I suppose the source could have been ignorant and merely used some cheap shady soap-bar hash. But still, I don't understand why such a powerful drug is rarely sold as what it is, other than it has such remarkable stigma that just it wouldn't sell.


I just realized how long this post is, probably the longest and most personally revealing I've made. I don't know if it can be considered a TR because like alot of reports, I didn't really know what it was, and I suppose if you don't believe me you could say I was just K'd out and delusional and dismiss my whole experience. But that's too tidy of an explanation, I feel way too much resonance with the other reports here and on Erowid, and in music like "Waterworld" by Leak Bros which is a lyrical exploration of the subject of PCP abuse. I can't relate to dipping a cigarette in leak and ether, as I've only recently starting experimenting with tabacco and never had it in that form. But I feel like this experience put a mark on my soul, and it's something I pretty much can't deny at this point without being carted off to the loony bin for good. To remain existentially authentic I had to integrate the experience, and there's still alot of work to be done. I assume whatever damage to my body and mind has been done, the drug reshuffled the cards and delt me my hand, it's up to me to deal with it and continue playing the game, or check out completely. I just had to get that off my chest as I feel like keeping it under wraps was eating me alive internally. Hope someone out there can get something out of this. Thanks for reading every one, PeaCe and ![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif)

I first smoked PCP at 16. Whilst driving on the wrong side of town.  It immediately felt like my head was smashed in with a sledge hammer as I slumped in the driver seat.  I definitely had a gangsta lean.  I somehow managed to control my spaceship to a nearby park with some hood OG's.  They stood there passing the lenyos around (lenyo is a joint of parsley sprinkled with PCP hydrochloride) and politicking about hood shit.  Meanwhile, I was on my third KJ dream.  I then pictured police everywhere. My steps were small...VERY small. As though my shoelaces were tied together. We called this "steppin on ants".  I didn't get far. 


The pigs rolled through and hemmed us up.  They asked who's vehicle was there by the curb. We all denied it.  He took my keys and started that bitch up.  I was still in another galaxy to even care.  He only locked my keys in my vehicle and told me by the time I walked to the gas station to get a tow truck out here I'd be cool to drive.  Weird cop.


Anyhow, I quickly built up a tolerance to PCP and began smokin those bad boys every day. For 2-3 years. I smoked it like most smoke kush these days. Then I just stopped.  I never experienced or saw all this "SUPER HUMAN" strength, running around naked stuff you hear about. And I was around a lot of blasters.  Even for years afterwards.   I did notice weak minded folks got real dumb or real "stuck" on it real fast.  But most of us, as we built up that tolerance,  just went about our day - blasted.

Soon a friend of mine will have some PCP, we will get in powder or crystal form appearantly and we're planning on smoking it. Now I have some basic questions about that:


1. What would be a correct dosage, assuming the powder is pure? (we have testing facilities in my country, and we will send in a sample to have it's pureness tested, if its cut we'll change dosage accordingly, so, does anyone know a regular dose?

2. Can you just roll a cigarette with the powder in it or would that not work and do you have to desolve it in some liquid first and then apply it?

3. If you solve it, what liquid would you use, demi water? Alcohol? Something else?


We're considering desolving it in some liquid to apply it to a cigarette, mostly because that way we could spread it more equally over the length of the cigarette, while with small dosages spreading the powder through a cigarette would make it more likely to end up rather un-even, which is not something we'd prefer ofcourse, but I'm mostly wondering, what do you solve it in, does it need to warm to solve it or can you do it cold etc.?


We are both very experienced with ketamine and nitrous oxide in a large variaty of doses and have no significant tolerance to ketamine, some though, as in, 75 mg does what 50 used to do two years ago so that gets me to my last question; is there any cross tolerance for PCP? 


We're planning on taking in an indoor setting with only 1 or 2 other people there, who would be our sober 'trip'-sitters, just in caze when we are in a strange, dissociated stated in which the subcontious is widely open while somehow still capable of moving (which I suspect is easier on pcp then on ketamine, moving?), there are people available to prevent us from doing anything silly, although I know my subcontiouss through ketamine and nitrous and LSD and I'm not expecting anything bad, we're just making sure and having some sober people there, that's  never a bad idea  on first times. 


Either way, these were my questions and information, proper information, on PCP is very rare, so I have very little information to browse through as it is and will have to ask more questions.

1) Smoked, it's hard to say. I guess it depends on the efficiency of your smoking method. I smoked 10 mg freebase (I think up to 20, I don't remember) on a dipped cigarette and got fairly mild effects. Insufflation of the HCl salt is mild at around 5mg and fairly strong, but still leaving you mostly functional at around 7-8mg. I definitely wouldn't go any higher than that the first few times.


2) You could definitely roll a cigarette with the freebase powder, and Alldaylong suggests you can do the same with the hydrochloride salt. I haven't tried it with the salt, but did try smoking it in a glass pipe and it was extremely harsh. Cigarettes dipped in freebase taste almost sweet.


3) Dissolving it depends on weather it's the salt or not, the salt will dissolve in water and alcohol, while the freebase will dissolve in alcohol and non-polar solvents, but not water. Diethyl ether is good for dissolving the freebase for smoking because it evaporates quickly, though naphtha, toluene etc. would work too. Make sure the solvent evaporates cleanly, and make sure it's all evaporated before sparking it up!


There's probably some cross-tolerance, and moving is easy on moderate doses, and very clumsy on high doses, but definitely possible.

Wow, I've never seen a drug with more nonsense, bullshit & straight up lies perpetrated about it. so many people have so many terrible misconceptions about PCP. dust is NOT that big a deal, i've smoked it many times and enjoyed myself each time (except the times that there were too many heads on the cyph to get dusted!) 


if you are going to smoke pcp you should throw out everything you've ever heard about it before. do NOT go into this with retarded ass expectations of going crazy or freaking out, you won't enjoy yourself. don't even bother reading anything about it on the internet like erowid trip reports or anything because the drugs effects are too subjective and I'm willing to bet lots of stories told on the net are people smoking dank for the first time and not being able to handle it. try to smoke it with people who do this shit before. personally I enjoy smoking pcp that's been attached to an inert carrier (mint leaves, parsley, w/e) than smoking "dips" (cigarettes, joints blunts, whatever dipped into liquid pcp) those go too quickly if theres a big group. 


pcp is one of the most fun and interesting drugs around...it's horrible that it has such a bad rap and is (mostly) relegated to the ghettos of large american cities. I truly believe many more people should be willing to smoke it and would enjoy themselves if they had a more open mind. After reading several pages of this thread it's very clear to me that several of you bluelighters have smoked (or claimed to smoke) pcp for no other reason than to convince yourself that pcp is a horrible drug (then tell the internet all about it) PCP is a very powerful mind altering substance that shouldn't be treated much differently than other drugs of its nature - if you go into this thinking you will hate it, oh god it taste and smells gross, oh god it's a dirty drug, oh god i'm gonna jump out a window, YOU WILL HAVE A BAD TIME. what do you expect?!?!? 


as for people actually open minded and willing to enjoy themselves on a new drug regardless of it's horrendous reputation, a whole new world of perception awaits you!


you should smoke dust in a moderately large group, say 4-5 people. if it's your first time it's probably better to be in a house. sherm produces a loss of inhibitions in the same sense that alcohol does, but i find it to be more like mdma (not in the sense that you're hugging and touching everyone around you) but the first time i smoked dust i genuinely bonded and became more open with the people around me. there is also a unique euphoria during the come up that rivals the feelgood moments of many other drugs (but it does not last long) intense CEVs are also a delight. the other peak effects are subjective and change from person to person. one thing i should note is that **you REALLY shouldn't drink alcohol during or prior to smoking dust. and you CERTAINLY should not be drunk and smoke it** i'm also willing to bet that many of the stories people have heard regarding pcp and outrageous situations also involved alcohol. alcohol turns it into some other shit, infact alcohol is a much more dangerous drug than PCP i'd say and i bet you've all taken more than one swig in your life.


I hope this post convinces at least ONE skeptic to try pcp, while not drunk, in an environment they are comfortable in, and enjoy it enough to tell a real life friend of theirs. There is no reason PCP has to have the reputation it does.

^^ yeah totally. Maybe another thing is that it's quite potent insufflated or, I guess, smoked well. It's probably much easier to take a higher dose than you were aiming for than with ketamine say.


StaySedated, how would you compare it with ketamine? I've never tried ket and was wondering if it's possible to get to something like a k-hole on it without being zonked for a day!

Something tells me that if it were true he would not be here talking about it like that, instead the horror stories told in the media about people going insane on PCP would be food for thought for a troll.


In the unlikely event he is telling the truth, what are you planning to do? Sound the alarm? Convince him to stop? Ehmm right.

**Pcp??? Anyone tried it and live to tell the story?**


I love dxm, ketamine barely gets the cake over it tho.  So I finally chased down pcp in liquid form.  I dipped half of a cigarette in pcp then dried it and smoked it.  It hit right away and was insane!  I've done high doses of dxm And fairly high doses of k for me at least yet none of them compared.  I couldn't move or think and I basically took a trip to hell in my own mind.  Satan welcomes me into hell and it scared the shit out of me.  Anyone else ever done pcp?  Did I do too much or is this just how it is and is it not worth doing?  I still have some left and am considering  doing more but am too scared unless I get advice.

For a first timer id say you did a bit much. With PCP you really want to take it slow if you're not use to it, the only exception in my mind being a ketamine connoisseur who has "gone that extra mile", so to speak.


While ive only done PCP a handful of times, almost each time has been rather enjoyable. I would only take a few small hits of the shermie (dipped cig) at a time, each time taking in a bit more than the last, to see what I could really push myself to without going manic, and I only had one minor freakout. For the most part, I couldnt move and felt entirely blissfully numb. My vision went very hazey like I was watching an old movie, and things became a bit darker in color, however it was enjoyable to say the least!


My words of advice: Take it slow with PCP, and be in a clear mindset, in a familiar and comfortable setting. If you can, have someone around your first few times. 


If you take it slow, and like extreme dissociatives, you should enjoy PCP, granted everyone is different and thats really just my personal feelings toward it.

PCP isn't really that extreme. It's just like K. All the stories about it were the same bullshit stories that were told about marijuana, LSD, Crack etc. For some reason the urban myth about PCP stayed - probably because not that many people ever got to try it like they did LSD so they didn't realise it was just bullshit. 


When you take PCP you feel a bit floaty and giggle a bit. End of story.

Good question. I've no answer....likely not in the us anymore, I think ket sidestepped pcp as the most efficient anaesthetic. Lol, and now they don't even use ket anymore n humans do they..? And since PCP doesn't have the same veterinary function as ketamine, 'm gonna say no pharm production of pcp right now in the us. I thin they stopped using it for medical procedures because of a high number of psychotic reactions...people throwing cars, cannabilizing nurses, eating their own fingers etc. Lol jk, but I think psychotic reactions caused production to cease.

**PCP... Ahh good old leak...**


So why do people think that PCP is such a bad drug?


It is rather glorious when used properly.


Everyone wants to bug out about all these RC's and vet drugs related to it, but are so pessimistic about the grandfather dipper? This confuses me...

It gets a bad rep; DARE targeted it more than anything else. 


I'd love to get my hands on some! NMDA receptor antagonists are fun.

When accidently taken thinking your consuming mescaline + mdma it was not a fun time at all. Turned out to be a combo of 2C-I, mescaline and no mdma. Do you like big doses or just small amounts? and do you smoke it or rail it? or whatever ROA

I'm talking about PCP...

Phencyclidine...


I like one booming dose, then I ride it out. I never redose...


I smoke it. I have never railed it before. It would be too potent to eyeball.

PCP is a dissociative so is covered by Psychedelic Drugs rather than BDD.. I'm going to move your thread over, hope that is okay. I'm not sure what the mods there will do with it ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

It doesn't really have *that* bad a reputation. More so you'll find most people online posting their opinion of it have yet to try it and many who think they have, haven't. If you've ever encountered someone saying they tried mescaline in a microdot it's like that.

I believe the only reason it has a bad rep is that it's easy to overdose on, which translates to:  today's "I'm a drug superman!" - stupid type people do PCP, do too much to the point where the DRI + NMDA effects are too much and they probably weren't in the right state of mind, or set and setting beforehand, and before you know they're on COPS every night of the week.

Because people relate PCP to Rodney King or some other strong urban male punching through fences and fighting cops.  And the general public doesn't really have a much better view of ketamine, that is only in our community.  Most associate K with horse tranq and that is it. At least here in the US that is.  I'm sure it might be a bit different in the U.K where it seems to be more popular.

I think ketamine has usurped the role pcp played in club culture in the 70's and 80's. The reason is because of the duration. Ketamine seems safer as you don't check out quite as long. 


I've heard a lot of pcp anecdotes from my parents' generation and I can see the appeal -- it seems like it can get pretty vision-questy. 


However, I don't think pcp's reputation for violence is completely unfounded. I have witnessed many more pcp rampages than ketamine rampages.

A lot of incidents that were originally penned as "He was on PCP and started fighting the cops after stealing a tank and running over ten schoolchildren" later turn out to be untrue, or PCP was just one of the many drugs the person was on.


Rodney King is a perfect example.  He wasn't actually on PCP, he was just really drunk.

The fact that it's so uncommon probably helps perpetuate the myths about it. People on here should be familiar with all the shit people who aren't involved with psychs say about them, same thing with dust. 


I'd love to try it, but the only shot I'd have of getting it would be driving down to South Central (or somesuch) and trying to cop it off the street. That's a bit too sketchy for me...

I think it's got a lot to do with the shock value (read: *entertainment *value) of the well-known stories associated with it (rappper eats girlfriend's flesh, man runs naked down the street, etc).

Man, I would love me a sweet head joint dipped in some PCP solution.  Always wanted to try that.  In high school, I always expected my weed to be "laced" with PCP as that was the going myth.  The deeper I got into drug use, the more disappointed I was that that never happened.  I would love to get me some of that.  Is it as addicting as ketamine can prove to be?

No. Schedule I means no use whatsoever. The only exception is GHB in the states (schedule I and III). They stopped making it in the late 70s, and even then it was a veterinary product as a medium to large animal tranquilizer. I don't think it is legal anywhere in the world..

There's loads of uses for ketamine in the world of Anesthesiology.  I have pushed it myself dozens of times in peds cases.  it's pretty weird to watch that glaze settle over the eyes and the person fall backwards into oblivion after being there myself.  Midazolam seems to really erase most of that experience but they're emergence is often like The Exorcist.   


PCP sounds pretty special. I have no idea what scene I need to fall into to make that happen.  Moving to Philly would be a start i think.

I can't stress how beautiful of a drug it is...


Formaldehyde is not a drug for the one billionth time... PCP is not formaldehyde. PCP is not dissolved in formaldehyde.


PCP is normally dissolved in a ether/water or acetone/water. Hence when it is not properly mixed, your whole cigarette will "poof" up in flames. LOL

**Phencyclidine (PCP) Questions**


Hey guys, have a few questions about Phencyclidine. I have experience with DXM and Ketamine, so this will not be anywhere near my first dissociative experience. However I want to play it safe and ask some few questions to people here. First of all, How much of a shermstick (cigarette dipped in PCP) should a first timer smoke? I know its hard to judge that because it depends on quality and dose it is, but if you guys were to estimate. Do I share the cigarette with 1 person and smoke half of it? 1/4 of it and put the rest out? Or do you just smoke the whole stick to yourself? My second question is that you are supposed to keep sherm/leak/pcp in the freezer until you are ready to consume it, correct? Someone said as long as PCP stays in the freezer it pretty much doesn't lose potency. That is what I have been told but wasn't sure. If I was to have a freshly dipped cigarette and had it at room temp for 30mins to an hour would it have a decrease in potency? Any advice on these subjects would be appreciated. Thanks guys. :D

Potency varies from batch to batch. Sometimes it's diluted so much you have to smoke blunts of it, other times a couple hits would get you off. I've heard in general one sherm stick can get 4 people high. The variance in potency is why shermhead's smoke slow tiny hits out of a dipped cigarette. And why PCP has a bad reputation, in addition to the PCC impurity.


30min-1hour rt wont hurt potency, I've left bags out for a couple days and it was still potent.


If you liked DXM, you'll love PCP. PCP is way more euphoric and cleaner than DXM. DXM is for kids who can't get sherm. DXM is to PCP what Darvocet-n is to heroin, or ephedrine is to methamphetamine.


Also if it's still got the ether solution on the cig, you can let it dry or if you're impatient, light it with the cherry of a cigarette.

Thanks a lot for your help. Really appreciate it. I see what you mean about taking tiny hits and have heard of that method as well. I'll probably take a couple small drags and put the cigarette out so I can judge from there. 


Yeah, I had fun with DXM but the nausea and everything got really tiring. Ketamine was my next step up, which I still absolutely love. Your analogy makes me very excited to try leak. I think I will have a lot of fun. If you've tried Ketamine, can you possibly try to compare the two experiences for me? So I can have a better idea of what to expect.


Duly noted about the ether bit. I did hear about some people having cigarettes blow/flame up in their face. One question though. After I let the ether solution dry, the cigarette will still have a wet/soaked appearance, right? Or will it look completely dry like a non dipped PCP cigarette? Sorry if that sounds like a stupid question, I just thought I'd ask.

Sadly I haven't tried ketamine yet so I can't compare. Strangely it's easier for me to get PCP than k, though the PCP scene has a lot of sketchy fucks that I'd rather not deal with![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png).


I'm usually too impatient to let it dry out, but one time I got shit that wouldn't dry out even if left out for a day. It was cut with real water(not the good kind). I thought that I got ripped off completely. Used the water to wash out some meth resin, hoping that the meth would sober me up from dank for work, boiled off the water and smoked it. Instead of sobering me up, it got me really stoned![8o](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eek.gif) lol. So if it doesn't dry up it's cut.

I'm not sure about your most recent question, but just so you know we have a [main PCP thread](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/316953-The-Big-and-Dandy-PCP-Thread) where it's easier to get answers to some of these questions about its use. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


I'll merge this thread with that one once you've had a chance to reply ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

PCP is the only thing I do as of right now. I didn't even think I was ever going to touch the stuff until I tried ketamine a few years ago. Ketamine was my fav choice back then. I was doing it almost every day, buying viles at a time. Then I started to research more about dissociatives and looking into PCP, reading stories and experiences about it. I read nothing good about it online but was still interested in trying it. Finally smoked some sherm last year and fell in love with it. I love the feeling it gives me, like a zombie lost in its own world. I barely pay attention to anything around me and move and do things as slow as a turtle. Been smoking it ever since and can't stop.

^ What makes you prefer it to Ketamine? I'm wondering from a personal perspective. I've never seen it available in Europe yet so whether I'll ever get to try it is questionable at best - but I'd like to know its strengths and weaknesses compared to Ketamine. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Ketamine to me makes me feel like I'm drunk with more control of myself while PCP puts me on a whole another level. From my experience I'll walk around like a zombie without a care in the world. My friends have even told me it takes me like 15 minutes to get in through a door from just smoking some sherm. In compassion, PCP is a bit more stronger than Ketamine. You have to have the right mindset for it or you can snap and have a bad trip.

Have you tried hole doses of Ketamine? Because at those doses there's no control, and it's near impossible to move from a laying/sitting down position. You leave the world behind and experience so much more than you could possibly imagine, all in a 50-60 minute timespan. At lower doses I find that yeah it just makes you feel drunk and happy, which is nice but if I were going for that experience I'd take something cheaper like DXM (which also does a better job at low doses imo).


PCP does sound very intriguing to me. I'll have to dig around and see if I can find some. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Yes, I've been an a hole before with Ketamine. I was stuck in a computer chair for about an hour unable to even move my hands on the keyboard. I actually enjoyed that experience though unlike some people I know who also do K. At those doses, I tend to be by myself, for personal reason.

I"m reading this book called "Man-Eaters" by Michael Bright, great book highly recommended! I found this passage interesting in the Bear chapter. 


"At the time, park officials were puzzled by the attacks and those of the previous year. But, then the brain tissues of the bear that had attacked the two men at Galatin was analysed. the scientists were looking for signs of abnormalities and they found some - there were traces of the drug PCP or phencylidine, better known as the street drug 'angle dust'. In humans it can produce violent, sometimes homicidal, behaviour, but it also finds its way inadvertently into the brains of bears and other large animals. It is the component of the powerful tranquilliser used to anaestheise bears when they are fitted with radio-collars for scientific tracking or are knocked out in order to be moved safely from one park to another. Nuisance bears would have been injected with such drugs, and for some of these bears - including the one that killed in the Galatin Forest - were junk-food addicts that turned to man-eating. The Galatin bear was hooked on what-ever edible rubbish civilization could provide and it was nicknamed Dumb-Dumb, because, every time it was relocated it found its way back from remote wilderness areas to the campsites and their tantalizing food. It was tranquillised at least 19 times. Could there be a connection? Could residues of PCP have accumulated in it's brain? The research has yet to be done"

Cool for those people who've always had it in their area, how common is it? Does it have a steady supply or will the supply fluctuate?

I recently heard about a 57 gallon pcp bust in Texas, is that a transit point for it?

There's a steady supply for me but I have to drive 25 miles every time I want some. Worth the drive though.

PCP is still the highest up on my personal to do list; I am so very very curious to PCP; I love ketamine, probably too much and I enjoy nitrous oxide quite a lot as well; dissociation is quite my thing and PCP seems to me as if it were to be the ultimate dissociative. It's a shame it's not that populair in europe; the only time I ever found pcp it was so cut up with non-active stuff there was litteraly 2% pcp in it (sample was lab tested); we did get effect out of that but having not that much of the rediculously impure pcp, not that much effect. A 'normal' line of ketamine was stronger... so the curiousity remains ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

just found this amazing doc from the 80s on pcp use. they smoke both sherm sticks and what looks like parsley or something with the pcp solution sprayed on.

[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaZALZ-bH9w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaZALZ-bH9w)

how do i embed the video?


plus a few more videos


a guy stuck in his chair laughing and screaming his balls off

I have come across some PCP. How does it compare to psychedelics? A tiny amount of pot can give me panic attacks, so I'm a bit worried about how this drug will affect me. I have heard horror stories from others who've used this shit. But I'm not sure if it's just been hyped up. To those that have used it: what's it like? And what can it best be compared to? I heard it's similar to ketamine.

PCP is a dissociative drug, like ketamine or, MXE, or DXM. It is usually either sold as a powdered hydrochloride salt for insufflation/injection/plugging/oral use, or as a freebase either dissolved in solvents like ethyl ether, or "dipped" onto cigarettes, cannabis, or mint/parsely leaves.


It is very potent and long lasting. Dosage is 500ug to about 10mg depending on how fucked you wanna get. The half life of PCP is pretty long, an experience will generally last a few hours or more. If you have never done dissociatives before, I would be very, very careful with it. The dissociative experience is unlike any other, and for some people they can freak out and act erratically.  (If you don't mind feeling numb and being unable to make any sense of your sensory input, you'll be fine...) 


Assuming you have it on a cigarrete, one or two inhalations is all you should need to get effects. If you smoke too much you will find yourself unable to move and may just black out. PCP is an anesthetic after all.


The "horror stories" of people going totally insane and throwing cars around in traffic are mostly unfounded. Most people will just get unpleasantly disoriented and need to lay down. Just remember set and setting, go easy and don't redose if it's your first time, and don't smoke dippers around a police station or your anti-drug parents, and you'll be OK.

If weed gives you panic attacks, PCP is definitely not for you.

pcp was a very intense ride for me (first dissociative I ever did). be very careful while you smoke the sherm stick as I presume you have in your possession. it can take you pretty far out there.

I have only tried it a very long time ago, mixed with a little cannabis, which I found to be sort of like a combination of ketamine and LSD, but I don't really know what it would have been like without the cannabis. This was back in the day when cannabis didn't give me anxiety. It was a very strange time, but I didn't get aggressive or freak out. The stories of people doing insane shit like murdering others while on PCP tend to be blown out of proportion and tend to be people who already had violent tendencies and were often on alcohol or other drugs at the same time. But different people react to it very differently. I would definitely read the trip reports as someone already suggested. Effects can be unpredictable.

other people would have more experience with this but i would not say it was similar.  ketamine was very boring and slow.  i think the dissociated from reality part was a little similar but ketamine was very mellow compared to pcp.  i don't think either of them are cool.  some people really like them though so it could be a personality thing.

if you have any mental problems or history of flipping out don't smoke pcp. otherwise i don't see why not. it's not good for you (neurotoxic) but it won't really turn you into a baby killer and all that.

my middle class white ass found a guy for this stuff in the ghetto.  it just seems odd to buy psychedelic drugs from a dope dealer, but PCP has always been on my bucket list.  i'm willing to trust the guy, but he said around here all you can get is the liq made up already, and i'd really prefer not to smoke the stuff.  what can I do here? put the liquid into a nasal spray bottle? evap? is oral/sunlingual/etc. an option with PCP?


point being, around here it's only a hood drug but I want to treat it like an acid or mushroom trip, and a wet cigarette just doesn't cut it

Why? DXM is unpleasant to a great many people, PCP is likely to be more "clean" feeling and enjoyable. Granted it has a higher abuse risk, but it doesn't have the laundry list of serious contraindications.

I'm pretty sure if you think you have access to real PCP, you probably don't. Likely it's just 3-meo-PCP. If you're sure it is real, just take a low dose and see how you feel. It is neurotoxic like someone else mentioned, however studies have been done showing that GABA drugs prevent most, if not all of the toxicity. This is true for all dissociatives, not just PCP. So take some etiz or xanax or whatever you have access to. It will probably also counteract any overstimulation you may have because PCP is also a dopamine releasing drug.

Do you have a source for that?


Also if its in the hood I think it likely he has got pcp. It is popular in the ghetto and often sold by the same dealers that sell dope and coke. I doubt the dealer is buying 3-meo and passing it off as pcp.

Hey man. The liquid is PCP freebase dissolved in diethyl ether. The only things it's usually cut with is either more ether or nail polish remover (acetone). Even uncut it probably contains a fair amount of byproducts and impurities, such as benzene, cyclohexanone, or piperidine. None of theses are anything that you should be spraying up your nose, swallowing, or holding in your mouth. These chemicals can be extremely irritating to the mucosa. The stuff is meant to be smoked, so just dip a cigarette or cigarillo in it and start smoking. The potency varies A LOT. So go slow. Take a few hits, put it out and wait a few minutes, and repeat as necessary. Trust me you don't want to go over board with PCP. There is a very fine line between  

 an interesting and enjoyable experience, and a terrible, long, confused and scary pseudo-psychotic trip. You wont go flipping over cop cars or eating babies or anything you've heard in the media, but too much dust WILL be very unpleasant.


As someone already mentioned, taking a benzodiazepine such as Xanax or Valium before hand is a good idea, and you should have some extra on hand in case your trip takes a turn for the worst.


PCP is actually one of my favorite and IMO one of the most intriguing substances I've tried. I've been using it moderately, and at times heavily for about 15 years. The majority of my experiences have been positive, but I have had some rough times on PCP mostly due to my being irresponsible and smoking more than I know I should.


If you treat this drug with the caution and respect it deserves, you will probably enjoy it. Be safe dude.

Is it the typical american liquid shit ? I wouldn't touch that with a ten foot pole, powder pcp is the way to go, like it has always been up here....at least you can measure out your dose. Several studies have shown that the typical street legends regarding pcp in the USA have a shade of truth due to the fact people smoke (which is an extremely fast ROA, and this kind ROA with pcp makes it for much more volatile reactions in most people) and it's random doses at that, you don't know if that hit was just 5mg or 60...or 100.. while with powder pcp (albeit often cut just for making it easier to weight, with inactives of course) is really nice in moderate doses, it gives such an euphoria and an augmentation in concentration....I've done things in video games and irl I didn't think I would ever do (the video game part was guitar hero scores that I wouldn't be able to beat sober or gta san andreas missions) and this one time after snorting around 20mg over a day I've emptied a billiard table in front of my girlfriend who didn't get a chance to play lol, it really helps out filter out any information doesn't need when trying to accomplish something, probably a result of the mild dissociation lowerish to medium high doses cause (it's really more stimulant at those doses), everyone I've seen go into peeholes have always regretted it (i've seen temporary psychosis from people eating and snorting too much of it for several days and it wasn't pretty).

I'd suggest ketamine first since it has a much shorter duration and is WAY more euphoric, then go for mxe, to me its much more deep and the hole lasts longer and is just the bees knees. I think pcp has such a bad rap from all those flip outs they show on cops of poor people living in the ghetto, wandering around outside in the summer. Remember heat and dissociatives don't mix, they're inside drugs for me at least


And as for hood dealers passing of 3meopcp as pcp I highly highly doubt the vast majority of them even are aware of rcs, especially psychedelic ones. I tried explaining one all about the 2c's and he looked at me like I was speaking chinese

I've had DXM which I liked (a lot) and tried many doses 50+ in all ranges including the 4th plateau, however ketamine I didn't like so much. 


I found ketamine very different from DXM and not at all as pleasant especially if even a bit of alcohol is thrown in the mix.


I will say once on ketamine I enjoyed myself and felt in a 'galactic' space when closing my eyes it was very much psychedelic and intense in a good way and another time when I mixed nitrous balloons with the k which is to this day one of the most memorable psychedelic experiences, imagine n-dmt but with euphoria and dissociation..also much of the psychedelia took form in audio form but visual as well.


Thing I like most about K is the mood lift at the end of a few bumps, it feels very much anti depressing but I never understood people that get addicted to K.


I would like to try PCP except that if it is like K but like a shot to the face due to smoking (rapid onset) then I wouldn't enjoy being so spaced out I couldn't put out or finish my laced cigarette. Although i have heard you can get very sedated and get a pretty euphoric effect from it to the point you dont want to move but i hope its more sedating than k-like.


p.s. Very hard to impossible finding this in Canada

PCP is very rare.  Formaldehyde ('wet') less so.  I try to personally avoid buying psychedelic drugs in the hood--the hood is good for crack sometimes and heroin if you're into that, but that's about it.  Also, the average dose of PCP to trip is 5 mg, so you can see why it's easy to overdose and freak out or worse.

^This.


There's no formaldehyde in wet. That is a myth. PCP is not at all rare, especially in inner cities. It's actually pretty common. I know that in some places it's hard to get, or doesn't exist at all, but in other places its everywhere. Liquid dust, "wet", "leak" or whatever you want to call it is indeed PCP. Formaldehyde has no psychoactive effects, it causes cancer, and is extremely irritating to the eyes, nose, and mouth. Attempting to smoke it would be very, very uncomfortable, not to mention incredibly stupid.

I smoked mint leaves dipped in PCP last night, which led to a very interesting meditation session. I wish I knew the dose. ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)

Yeah, "mess" "mescaline" is mostly an eastern canadian thing, i dont think it goes farther west than sudbury in the north and maybe kingston in the south. Not as many bikers which have as much power as the cops in western canada, except maybe BC considering all of the good things that make their way from BC to here...but anyways..

Last time I've had some pcp, i was buying what they call "pure" which is not, but is about 20% pure, long ago  they realized only a few select people up the chain have the brains and knowledge to manipulate what some know is called 1/100, which is the pure liquid. 1g for 100 grams of "mess" and some heroin thrown in just to have a little extra addictiveness...I wish I didn't know all this info, but since it is info I acquired long ago when I was pretty young and dumb and had made my way up weed and lsd distribution....i knew about some funny things like that. Strangely this RCMP article saying they dismantled a PCP trafficking network in 2009...last time I had was in the fall of 2008, and it was 1/50, very liquidish but still would stick together...the only way i can describe its appearance is if cum sticked together like boogers. I tried smoking it this way by using a butter knife and just spreading a little bit over a joint, and it did work, and i did get pretty zoinked out, but since I was newly on benzos at the time i didn't flip out at all, I felt pretty awesome and me and my friend who did it with me the second time i did that really found it awesome to feel like a painless robot that was able to perfectly throw some pie cardboard box we found on the street and throw it in a basketball net while fucking around on the land of small primary school, perfectly with one hand all the time.


This aspect of PCP in small to moderate doses always really amazed me and confuse me, how can a drug with such a chemical, social and medical effect and reputation could make me gain extreme dexterity...I'm sure the dissociation when not in hole areas and the fact that pcp unlike dxm and ketamine is pretty stimulant at these doses explains it..but sometimes I wish i had a small stash of pcp for when I want to things to impress people...maybe could make money by doing things that seem impossible to most people...I know I did and impressed people at mundane things like I've said in my previous post..I hope the rcmp hasn't destroyed that pcp network...it was something that made quebec a special scene...heh, like the meth that is only in pills. I still don't like that people with less self control and maybe a bit less intelligent would do doses way farther than a p-hole and act toxic to themselves and their environment.


I see that Operation, which they say was only targeting the north shore of qc, where white civilization ends except for 2 small towns there and how it might have contributed to the general destruction of the remnants of the natives in canada before the younger generation woke up late last year...I agree that it's not a drug to distribute to the poor weak and socially alienated.....natives are to Canada often what "ghetto people" and blacks / latin americans are to the USA. Although I doubt they only sold to these places, the lab being in quebec city does not surprise me, everybody from the maritimes to eastern ontario know that the stuff is made in Qc City and has always been since the 70's. It might have been good in some way that the mounties did something about that but I don't think the drug results in the same when it makes it to people from my original hometown, which was quite northern and kinda in the middle of qc city and those indian communities...a fun fact, the people who seemed to have very low will and control over themselves fucking themselves over with mess (pcp) were people who were natives living outside the reserve or half natives who do not mention being that due to the centuries of cultural massacre we've imposed  upon them. We probably altered their DNA by having them become alcoholics on purpose for mirrors....I don't know if its a bad evolutionary trait they have acquired but these people always seem to struggle with hard drugs much more than their fully european fellow citizens even if they live in towns and cities and not in reserves and originally do not display anything natives about themselves.

I don't know if wet is real pcp or not, but I do know that real pcp is one of the most damaging recreational drugs there is.  I knew someone who went insane from it.

I've done it twice both sourced from my local ghetto via dope dealer. As stated before these are people with little knowledge or computers they are most likely unaware of the term RC let alone 5-meo substituted compounds. 


Anyway the first time I over did it and spent 2 hours in a coma on the ground. I was watching fireworks and crazy shit but in my head. The rest of the night was odd when I awoke ketamine esk but not really more like dxm without all of the negative effects. Had a bad hang over the next morning. 


Second time took 2 hits and felt off but not great. Maybe it takes gettin use to but it isn't my cup of tea. I am surprised its not big in the festival scene for the kids Rollin around making noise on mxe or ketamine. It's not bad but just not my thing, ill take K and nitrous please.

Mostly knew people who had temporary psychosis from it, but yeah, it was ugly, but they were also recklessly snorting away huge doses..i experimented away like it like you'd expect a fellow bluelighter to from 2000 to 2008 i maybe had it 12 times max...and i would take very little at once.


And I think the typical liquid shit in the usa is very impure, not as in bad cuts are added, but that the synthesis isnt made by people who know much what they're doing and leaving some PCC in the final product...which is horrible for you and can kill you. Doesn't seem like the same kind of thing here, here people could binge snort away "mess" and other than the obvious signs of abusing a long acting fat absorbing dissociative (it accumulates in the body like methadone) they didn't drop like flies and I only know one guy who lost most of his brains because of it and never rebounded from extreme usage. If there had been PCC like a lot of the american pcp i know does, they'd have died long ago when the thing was everywhere from the 70's to the early 2000's. Honestly it was the second most common drug here, weed dealers would have it too, the holy trinity back then was pcp, weed and lsd, thats when mdma was still 50 dollars and meth pills were 20-25 and only done by ravers.

There used to be alot of it here sold off as mescaline though most people with a brain knew it was angel dust as the effects are nothing like mescaline. The most common form of it here was the stuff the real oblivion was talking about. It's a kinda pasty stuff that you can eat, snort or smoke. I don't know if you can IV that type of dust and i only know one guy who has actually shot angel dust. He said he was basically pinned to the floor for half the fucking day while having wild dissociative hallucinations.

I only smoked a dime joint to mostly myself while giving a few of my buddies a few puffs. By the time i was finished the joint i knew i was going to really be in for it. By the time i walked back inside my friends house i could barely walk and everything looked very fucked up in that weird dissociative way. I started to get these weird dissociative type hallucinations and after maybe 20 minutes walking was next to impossible. I ended up lying on the floor very fucked up and having hallucinations and this sense of dread that i had taken too much. My stupid self decided that alcohol might help me come down so i had a few beers which of course only made me more fucked up and i puked my guts up too. I don't know where angel dust get's it's rep to cause people to become extremely violent on it because a 5 year old girl could have beaten me up in the state i was in.

Was it the putty that in the joint or the lactose + pcp "mescaline" ? funny how calling it mescaline was all over qc and the maritimes even though people knew it was just a nickname, we called it mess because it would turn you into well...a mess if you had too much. I only succeeded in smoking smoke after putting about what would get in 1g of the mess when i had 1/50 shit, otherwise the putty is too thick to deal with, the 1/20 stuff anyways. I only ever felt really robotic from dxm, i had pcp much later and in small doses so i didnt get full blown dissociation, small doses produce a kind of psychedelic euphoria / stimulation where everything is very grandiose....I could see why its popular in the ghetto as I can see similarities with small to medium doses as with cocaine/crack.

All I can say is my father was an avid PCP user and it definitely effected me as a child and adult. My body used to seize up as a kid where I couldn't move, then I was clinically diagnosed and hospitalized for Bi-polar disorder and schizophrenia. My father also has Bi-polar disorder, and he actually is pretty successful now a days.


I would stick to mushrooms and LSD myself.

PCP is one thing being over in Australia that i have never had the privilege to come across, its one of those things that really interests me as NMDA antagonists are by far my favorite class of drugs & i really enjoyed 3-meo-pcp the few times ive tried a smallish dose.


Anybody whos tried the two orally care to elaborate if there is much of a difference between them other than the whole smoking of PCP thing which is just a different ball park i assume.

I would definitely try PCP if I had the chance, as I like 3-MeO-PCP and ketamine. Unfortunately nobody in Sweden uses PCP. It's like the only drug (that is fairly common otherwise) that I've never heard of anyone I know trying. PCP remains a mystery here.

^ The last time i had some 3-MeO-PCP, i also had the thought of how the 'original' PCP could be like? It's 3-MeO-Variant is really one of the most interesting compounds i've ever stumbled across.


So, even though i usually dislike the whole 'how does it compare to'-thing (as with MXE and Ket, for example), i'd really like to know if there are (more) similarities between those two compounds?

I grew up in a major United States city where there's a lot of PCP and I never used it but I know lot of people who had, and I know people who are in their mid 50s or older who told me how they used it in the 70s and 80s and it's still very hypothetically easy to get if you want it.


The people I know who used it would usually buy it in very bad areas and it was put on very shitty herb, like pot that's worse than Mexican schwag, as a powder you could snort, or in cigarettes dipped into liquid PCP and low dose effects would make the person feel more tall or as though they were sort of floating or walking/levitating above the ground, and they would feel very drunk and movement would be very difficult.  Some guys I knew in highschool who were sometimes into smoking blunts of dust told me how they once smoked it sitting on this one guy's parked car and they'd jump off of it and they'd feel as though they were flying while high on PCP.  Another guy I know who thought he smoked opium but really smoked PCP as it was marijuana and not opium said he smoked a small bowl of it before watching a movie at home and said it was as though he was outside of his body observing himself.


High doses were according to acquaintances I knew who took them on purpose to see what it was like: akin to being like a zombie or just stumbling around, slurring your words and being very confused, having it literally impossible to move, and some got freaked out and thought they'd died but then calmed down.


Nobody I know who used PCP became violent towards themselves or other people.  Also these people were using PCP as it was decades before K became widely popular, and 3-MeO-PCP was not around.  Only a few of these people were dustheads, and most would just smoke dust or get wet if somebody else had some.

If you look around on good old erowid about pcp it will talk about its stimulants effect...that some even get at large doses...i've only witnessed that though once but it might have been the guy's specs at the time : who not only a vendor of that but also classic lsd blotter circa 99-2000-2001 and it might have been the large doses of that which he would eat to "destroy the proofs" that kept him up.


Myself high doses made me unable to get off  bed, not fun, only went that far when snorted too much of that mess (people would sell it like weed is sold, 1g, 1/4, 1/8 etc.)


One of the first joint I smoked had some in it (but it wasn't the unmeasurable liquid sherm stuff, my friend just put some of that powder cut with lactose in the joint) and I did get this feeling taller/floating above the ground feel! Hah, I barely remembered it myself and you brought it up, that was in 2000 certainly.


And yeah, I never understood people who got hooked to it, until some guy that was upper level that told me the 1/100 stuff (basically pure liquid, no cut) that the bikers or w/e who made it would add a little heroin so people would get hooked, not enough to get a full blown opiate buzz but just enough to have your body associate the mess with feeling awesome.


I really believe him still, he's still one of my best friends although he's out of the game, ah, growing old, sucks, but at least we got stories ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


p.s. what the people you know described as high dose reminds me of the time I had 1.5g of dxm in powder form.....bad times.

Hello, 


My name is Kate Godfrey, I’m a producer for National Geographic’s documentary series, Drugs Inc. I’m making an episode about Washington DC and I’m interested in stories of PCP in and around the city. 


I’m posting on the forum as I’d like to hear from anyone who can help me with my research regarding PCP.


To learn more about Drugs Inc please visit our home page at: 


[http://channel.nationalgeographic.co...nel/drugs-inc/](http://channel.nationalgeographic.co...nel/drugs-inc/)


If you’re not already familiar with the show, we are now in our 5th series and past episodes can be found on youtube.


The documentary takes a 360 degree approach to exploring drugs in Washington DC. We're filming with people who use drugs; both recreational users and users who have developed dependencies, harm reduction, law-enforcement, traffickers, dealers, and medics whose lives are affected daily by the drugs business. 


Through this approach the shows aim to understand how the drug world functions in a particular city: Who controls it; which drugs are most prevalent; why people become involved; the dangers of the street; what law enforcement is doing and approaches in harm reduction. In no way do our programs glamorize drug use or the drug trade. We treat everyone we film with dignity and try to give a balanced representation of the issues.

Got ahold of a little vial of this. I don't smoke cigs so I'm planning to soak mint leaves and then smoke it in a blunt wrap. Can someone outline the basic steps? i.e. how much leaf to use, whether to dry it out afterwards, etc. (or make any better suggestions). TYVM

im guessing you have no idea the concentration of the liquid in the vial...so if you don't smoke cigs then roll up a joint of some kind of herb and dip it in the vial.  I wouldn't soak mint leaves and then roll the soaked leaves up, that sounds like a quick way to over dose.  Just take a hit or 2 off your herb joint that was dipped in the PCP and see how you're feeling... you can always smoke more

I've always been so interested in PCP seeing as I've NEVER come across it, but more in a "viewing a car crash" type of way.


I'm anxiety prone so I assume I'd freak out.


Just out of curiosity, simply because I've never asked anyone, would PCP cause a bad reaction with an SSRI and a benzo?


I'm assuming the benzo would help someone NOT freak out, but that the SSRI might lead to serotonin syndrome.


Doesn't really matter one way or another cause I doubt I'll ever come across it, let alone consider trying it if I DID, but I always wanted to know.

Correct: PCP is an SRI so nobody should combine it with an SSRI, that could be dangerous to begin with let alone that serotonergic issues can cause paranoia and confusion, etc (like fever I think) which is extra unsafe under the unfluence of PCP.

Benzo's are not recommended because potent dissociatives tend to have amnestic effects and benzo's do as well, so you would increase the chance of a blackout state in which any number of weird things could happen.


I have not tried PCP but I know reasonable dosage of 3-MeO-PCP pretty well, if you would so choose to try PCP careful titration of your dosage is imperative. Although PCP culture apparently has adopted various applications of PCP to carriers, that could be an unwise idea because it obscures careful control of dosage. Often they learn how to make up for it but clearly that is not always the case.

Overdosing is mostly what I think everyone must look out for, freaking out may be the least of your worries if not.

But at low to normal doses in my opinion 3-MeO-PCP can feel very peaceful and tranquil, like a fake kind of Zen. People who go higher should look out and they might try to get by on experience, but I think it is pure hubris to think you could be immune to mania. If that dissociated mania actually hits, I don't think a benzo is effective or helpful anyway, let alone safe.


I saw this Erowid TR:

[http://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=101813](http://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=101813)


It's fortunate for this retired physician that he got away with it, but it seems like poor judgement that he did not check the pharmacology. Because venlafaxine (Effexor) is an SNRI: serotonin-norepinephrin reuptake inhibitor, maybe there is less emphasis on the serotonin but it still should not be combined with PCP-like compounds.


Please let this be a lesson for everyone who takes psychiatric medications to first check if it is safe to take certain other drugs with it.

^^^^


So would 3-Meo-PCP be safe with an SSRI and a benzo??  (Klonopin and Prozac)


Also, I know Ketamine is a different drug but I've always wanted to try it.


I've HEARD from moderators like Sekio that MOST LIKELY...MODERATE dosages of Ketamine would be safe with Prozac (and of course Klonopin as they are often prescribed together...Ketamine + a benzo being a therapeutic combo I have heard).

Indeed ketamine is different, its actions on transporters is relatively limited and so should its interactions with other drugs be...


Due to the reasons given above I would say that no, you would be running additional risks and it is not really safe. I'm amazed SSRI's are not in the MXE combinations subthread OP list. It definitely deserves reading up on. I am saying this because dangers seen with MXE may also be there for 3-MeO-PCP and PCP or vice versa.


It may be so that risks with something like MXE or 3-MeO-PCP are not quite as serious as with something like tramadol. But still, be careful...

Ok, so you are saying you think Ketamine is safe to mix with an SSRI and a benzo most likely?

It's not that black and white, there is still a small potential for interaction between K and SSRI's but compared to a number of other dissociatives you might call it sort of safe. If you must try it, keep dosage reasonable and don't make the sessions long. And stop immediately if you don't feel right.


If you want to discuss it more or share experiences check other threads using the search engine, I'm sure they are out there.

I've sometimes taken a benzo (temazepam) on the comedown from 3-MeO-PCP or MXE, it helps with the residual stimulation.


I had a very bad experience once taking 6-APDB, which is a serotonin releaser, the day after a 3-MeO-PCP trip. I felt ill the whole time and kept getting hot flashes. So based on that I'd think SSRI's would be a bad idea too.

People think it's a bad drug because of people hurting themselves, or hurting others on it.


And from propaganda like this:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbeXogXtawI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbeXogXtawI)


In that video they claim that PCP causes Schizophrenia but that's not true since if you're not Schizophrenic to begin with, you're not going to become Schizophrenic if you use drugs.  They should have said something like, "If a person is Schizophrenic and uses PCP, the drug can cause them to have a psychotic break."


I never used it back when I used stuff but I know a lot of people who did smoke PCP.  Only a few smoked it with any regularity and the rest would just smoke it when it was offered, or someone had some.  Nobody hurt themselves or other people, and at moderate to high doses they said it was literally impossible to move and they disassociated.  Lower doses made them feel relaxed and as though gravity was off.

A lot of fairly uneducated ghetto dudes cook this shit, and who knows how much unrendered PCC or cyanogenic compounds your smoking. It's easy as to get by the vial in any major city in Texas, but the people I know who smoked it grewing up were perma fried that was the only reason I never tried it.

That's why I always found our scene in eastern canada safer, cut to the max with lactose, but it was a powder and to overdose you'd need to snort 3g+, the whole formula was made up in the 70's. We always had it in powder, and the pure powder mixed with lactose, the purer it is (1/20 is pretty white and means will make 20grams of powder pcp when cut with lactose or quinine, those are the most common cutting agents, oh powder sugar too for people who did it on the go after buying the 1/20 putty. But when you got the 1/50 powder it was yellow and smelled like hospital/meds, its such a weird peculiar smell, but we knew at least the shit was pure, there was a Walter White or multiple of them here in QC at one point in the 90's and 2000's. Funny how last time I saw any, its when the SQ (Provincial Police) did a huge Hell's Angels sweep, the biggest yet, and this time it wasn't because they were threatening kids selling weed that wasn't theirs like in 2000-2001.

Well PCP is a different drug than ketamine or MXE... but also, maybe different life circumstances?  Different levels of being traumatized in the general population?  People who take a lot of ketamine just lay down and enter a dissociative hole, plus ketamine is sedating.

^^^The people you see in youtube videos acting psycho are the same people who are crazy as hell everyday while sober. They simply have an undiagnosed/untreated mental illness of some kind. They couldn't hold down a job if they tried. Crazy people should never take any mind altering chemical unless supervised by a medical professional. Problem is if your truly crazy.....I don't think you would know you were crazy. Most likely they think everyone else is crazy. lol.

I smoked PCP a few times a long time ago.  I was living in a ghetto area of a suburb just outside of Los Angeles.  I always had pleasurable experiences.  The most notable one was as follows:A couple of friends of mine and I were sitting around bored one hot summer afternoon, and one guy proposed going down the street and buying a sherm from the guys on the corner.  I'd never done it before.  We three shared the sherm.  I was sitting in a chair across from the two guys, who were talking and suddenly they turned into Heckle and Jeckle, the cartoon crows, complete with vests and cigars.  It was a vivid hallucination.  I thought this was funny.  After a few minutes of this, Heckle and Jeckle turned into skeletons.  It wasn't scary at all; I still found it funny and absorbing.  After a while, the hallucination dissipated and the guys turned into themselves again.  I got up and looked outside, and everything looked as though it was made of plastic, even the trees and plants, kind of Disneyland-like, with a vinyl sheen.  I told the guys and they noticed the same thing.  I think the whole thing lasted a couple of hours.  I've taken various psychedelics before and after this, but I never experienced such vivid hallucinations as on PCP.  I liked the drug alot and it seemed to like me, but I just did it a couple of times after that right around that same time and never had a desire to do it again.

I've discussed it before with my old friend paranoid_android, see people who smoke random quantities of PCP will undoubtely freak out. In other parts of the world like here, it comes as powder which is cut so much (with safe inactives) that it's hard to overdose (would need to snort a 1/8 of the thing) but even snorting half a gram of the powder that's not as cut as usual will surprise some...a lot like heroin, but there's a lot more dosage control with such methods of delivery. I've seen people walk like zombies and not say a word or talllllllkkkkk realllllllll sloooowwww because of eaten PCP, when people would get some of the "pure", excitement was abound and we'd eat half a matchead and it was a couple days of dissociative craziness for sure. Although to me there was nothing too crazy happening (i'm scripted benzos everyday).

I think the "typical PCP user" is quite different from those who are into K, MXE or other arylcyclohexylamines. PCP is heavily stigmatized and just isn't used in the same social circles as K or MXE. I know plenty of people who love K and MXE, but wouldn't touch PCP with a ten foot pole. There are some obvious differences between the drugs, though, even if they are all dissociatives. I've never actually tried PCP, but 3-MeO-PCP is supposed to be relatively similar, and that did seem much more capable of causing a negative experience than any other dissociatives.


I also can't imagine the people living in the areas where PCP is prevalent are being too mindful of harm reduction either. I don't know if this goes for K since it's also primarily a street drug, but I'd hope that a majority of those using newer arylcyclohexylamines ordered from the internet are doing allergy tests, using a mg scale, titrating doses, etc. 


All the same, I'm sure there are still people freaking out on all these drugs, but it's probably easier for the media to sensationalize PCP mishaps since they've been doing it for such a long time.

Well in the US, PCP is known as a ghetto drug like crack because that's where it's primarily used and sold.  I'm not sure why because you don't find much acid, ketamine, or any other hallucinogens in the hood.  I think that's why those people freak out on it, because they are not used to drugs like that, they are more used to coke, heroin, weed etc.  


What I'm wondering is where all these gangs find the precursors necessary to synth PCP.  Since most of it is made in California I'd assume they get that shit like piperidine from Mexico.  PCP even today is still shrouded in mystery.  I wish more info was available about it.

Hello big and dandy! How I have missed you. 


After searching fruitlessly for fifteen years I finally found PCP. Yay! I'm wondering what the best thing to do with this stuff is and what to expect. There is only 3mg. I am pretty experienced with dissociatives. DXM was my DOC years ago and hundreds of experiences are under my belt. Also fairly experienced with MXE, N20 and a little K as well and a list too long of other stuff. How does this stuff relate to those? I reaaaally like plugging when ROA allows. But I'm curious how to get the most effect from this outside of IM or IV. Anything that would potentiate it might be nice to know. Booster dose is not an option til next time. Any thoughts or suggestions related or not would be nice. Thanks BL ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Neat, you found it in powder form and know the dosage, I'm gonna guess you're from my big country too ;p


3mg? Just eat it, that's a lowish dose, and eating it lasts a lot longer than any other method but is easier, if you know what I'm sayin'. If it's an hcl powder, don't smoke it. Eating pure is what it was all about when you could find someone willing to sell you well, "pure", 20% pure putty, the guys distributing it are pretty smart in my general area as not to distribute it in too pure forms that could kill somebody who doesn't know what they're doing. But the 20-30% pure white/yellow putty was normally sold cut with lactose to make 15g normally, where 1g would be a standard noob dose.


You're gonna feel the stimulant effects at that dose too, your heart might beat like if you had lots of cocaine, don't freak out, dissociation should be minimal, but there.

It's always been hard for me to find information about this substance. Elusive. It's powdery and sort of sticks to itself but it's dry. No what form it is though. I've always heard of smoking it but eating is good too.


How does the stimulant effect compare to MXE?

Never had MXE, i'm old school like that, I stopped caring about the RC scene after operation web tryp 1, then when I realized how to find what I wanted, even if it had to come from europe but also found 3 canadian vendors (one is a dickhead), MXE was sold by a canadian vendor for 3 weeks and never again. 


I've done PCP about 8-10 times and ketamine orally from special compound pharmacist cream from my ex opi dealer who's truely in pain in both shoulders to the max, who takes ungodly amounts of hydromorph contins and dilaudid per day, they try to have him take less by many means, first there was Cesamet .5mg gelcaps for a long time then he got a ketamine cream mixed with voltaren (NSAID), lyrica, nortryptiline and lidocaine....so I put a small ball of cream on my tongue and got a high reminiscent of PCP but very short, also the dose must have been very low, you can't use those creams to get to a k-hole. Sorry, I would have liked trying MXE but it seems to be gone from most vendors these days.

I liked ketamine. The shorteness of it is a cool but its pricey. Mxe is around you just have to know where to look. What about duration of oral PCP vs smoked? Sometimes I just want a shorter experience.

I've only taken PCP orally once but iirc it lasted around 6 hours.  I've smoked it many many times and strangely enough the duration seemed to vary widely based on the quality of your dust.  In general the strong effects lasted around 4 or 5 hours.  I've had PCP trips last several days though so you never know with this drug.

I've eaten and snorted it pretty often in 2001/2002. Snorted it kicks right in fast with a kind of stimmy effect. Once I snorted a little with an ex gf of mine who pulled out a gram of "mess", which is the form you got in cut with lactose, so to snort it. Hadn't seen it in years and we were like 3 days in a meth eating binge and I was really tired but she wanted to go play billard. It really put me back on my feet with a kind of competitive / concentrated feeling and emptied the pool table in the first 2 games and she didn't get to play. Also another time I got home after a party after snorting some, I was really dissasociated in the bus but once I got home I played Guitar Hero 3 and got 5 stars on the last songs I wasn't able to. It sorts of resets your programmed failures and gives you a lot of confidence in doses that aren't too high, I don't like to be fully dissociated, I know a guy who ate too much at once and stayed in his bed 3 days looking at the ceiling and his mom was telling him "you'll stay like this forever"....crazy bitch.

I'm a god on any multiplayer FPS while on MXE. I think dissociatives are similar to psychedelics in that at the right dose it puts you so much into the moment, into the flow, the zone, that you're able to really use your full potential.

WRONG.

I used to think this but with anesthetics it can happen to anybody. Never underestimate what these drugs can do to you if you take too much.

Only time I've ever fucked out on drugs was after an IV propofol shot in hospital. Apparently I got off the operating table and tried to escape because I didn't want the sevoflurane gas. The doctors had to restrain me. I don't remember a thing.

i too have committed some very bizarre acts on ketamine in public that were absolutely very scary for people to witness, involving a knife and little clothing. i knew what i was doing, i just didn't give a fuck. i would never hurt anyone, i just found it hilarious to be the center of fear.


there was much mdpv in that phase of my life too, though

You don't know what you're talking about.

I'm an experienced and heavy psychedelic user, I've been smoking weed daily for 7 years and I like to party on benzos (which have a reputation for causing memory loss and stupid behaviour).

Listen: I have been in some right states - some very nice and some not so nice - but I've NEVER got to the point where I didn't know what I was doing, or did anything I later regretted.

I used to think this way too and I'm telling you, it's bullshit.

We're talking about anesthetic drugs here, not weed or psychedelics. These drugs rob you of your consciousness - it's what they were designd to do. It really doesn't matter how hard-headed you think you are. They are so effective at what they do that a surgeon can slice you open and you literally won't feel or remember a thing.


And don't forget that this thread is about PCP which can be *very* easy to take too much of if you're smoking dipsticks.


I would thank you to research [Propofol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propofol) before you try to discredit me. This stuff is known as 'milk of amnesia' and for good reason.

I didn't "choose to push the edge and take too much". It was administered to me in a clinical setting by an anesthetist while I was on the operating table. Obviously the amount I was given put me into a state where I wasn't quite totally unconscious and still able to move around, which is extremely dangerous. PCP was notorious for doing this to people (being quite a strong stimulant as well as an anesthetic), which is why it's no longer used as a surgical anesthetic. Have you ever heard of the term 'psychotomimetic'?


My mental health is perfectly fine. I've got antisocial personality disorder but that's a non-issue - if anything this makes it easier for me to handle mindbending drugs.

Yeah but the point is that the mad 'beat up the police/punch a plate glass window through' stories make the news and youtube cos they're unusual - like in the bill hicks routine, you don't get news stories like 'today a young man took pcp, realised we're all one consciousness experiencing itself and there's no such thing as death - now here's tom with the weather'.  Most people in that state wouldn't do that mad stuff, just dribble on the floor (or dribble incoherently while pacing up and down the bus naked maybe).  


Unfortunately, this is compounded by people watching those youtube vids and thinking that's what it's supposed to do to everyone (like wanting to fly/become orange juice on lsd), and even seeking it out because they think it does that in some macho wish-fulfilment fantasy - they then try and act that stuff out in a suggestible state like life imitating art/youtube.  IME i only experienced bliss, joyful feelings and a bit of alice-in-wonderland weirdness - i didn't once feel the need to lift a car over my head or break some handcuffs or anything (getting out the door would have been tricky anyway).

ASPD is a very serious condition that shouldn't be underestimated. For the sake of harm reduction, I would like to say that ASPD sufferers shouldn't take psychedelic drugs (or street drugs, for that matter, except perhaps cannabis, as long as it's taken in moderation). That said, I wonder if this condition could be successfully treated with psychedelic therapy while under the care of a very highly trained and experienced psychiatrist that hasn't been bought by the pharmaceutical industry.


Link to ASPD: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisocial_personality_disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisocial_personality_disorder)


Anyhow, you're correct about the rest of what you've been saying. A person doesn't need to be predisposed to psychotic behavior in order to be capable of going ape while under the influence of a drug like PCP (or any other powerful mind-altering substance, actually).

I disagree.

ASPD 'sufferers' are emotionally shallow and less easily traumatized than most people so there's less scope for a bad trip.

I highly doubt it.

When I take psychedelics, I get a profound feeling of love *for myself*.  Everything looks so beautiful and it fills me with joy but I know that  it's just my brain that's making me see these things. The euphoria is  blissful but it's all very hedonistic, superficial and silly.

I never actually learn anything from tripping and these drugs haven't done anything to change my world view. If anything, they just reinforce my way of thinking. I like psychedelics because for the most part they are physically harmless and the euphoria they give is unparalleled.

Define a 'bad person'.

There are good psychopaths and bad non-psychopaths in this world.

I'm no saint but I do believe that in the grand scheme of things, I am one of the good guys.

Then wouldn't that also lead to decreased potential emotional consequences, thus increasing the likelihood of acting outrageously? If you are emotionally shallow, then wouldn't the subconsciousness deterrents to acting in ridiculous ways such as "what will my family think...what will my best friends think...how will I feel if I do this...how will I feel if doing this hurts others..." be less, thus lowering the threshold of your mind saying "ok let's do this"?


I'm not attacking you, or the condition. I just had the thought after reading and am seeing two sides to this.

So I got a little vial of what I'm told is pcp in ether. It has some tobacco in it from the previous owner dipping. Can I strain and evap this then follow with an acetone wash of the vial? It'd be nice to know how much it actually contains for safe dosing. I also have that 3mg I posted about before. Was thinking of combining them if the cumulative weight isn't too high. What's a good starter dose anyway? Was hoping for shorter duration and a mediumish intensity. Not sure the roa for this.

Also, you mentioned that when you take psychedelics (which are potentially and ideally mind-expanding substances), your world view and established beliefs are not just left unchanged, but reinforced, and you apparently prefer that. With that in mind, I have to ask the following: do you take psychedelics for anything other than temporary pleasure and/or escapism, at least sometimes?

Yeah you could do that! Oral, vaped, plugged, IM, and IV. They'll all work you'd just need to adjust doses accordingly to each ROA. Three mgs vaped would actually probably be a pretty fair dose. Guy didn't tell you the concentration, just smoking like dip a cig in, and smoke X amount?

Yeah I see what you mean. I think being less susceptible to having a bad experience in the first place kinda offsets this risk though. I think what you're saying would apply more to borderline than ASPD - people who have strong emotions and insecurities to begin with.

I've had a look but I can't find any studies on the effects of psychedelics on people with ASPD.

The condition itself is well-documented though.

Personally I have had a couple of bad trips but these were caused by silly things such as my flat being a mess; or restless energy from being bored and having nothing to do (this sucks when you're tripping). When you're chronically unable to give a shit, you're much less at risk of freaking out.

Yup - it's a great feeling. It's because of this that I'm able to use these drugs so frequently.

Cool thanks. So how much adjusting should be made for each ROA? I was hoping to vape it considering the theoretically shorter duration. I guess the only issue is I don't know what form it is in. If the dry stuff is Hcl I can't do much but eat it right? But we can assume the liquid solution is freebase. Is 3mg really a fair dose? I know erowid is pretty lacking in information on this chem. Due to the long half life, I wouldn't want to redose if the initial dose wasn't strong enough for my preferences. I wouldn't be able to for a while anyway. This bag of K has been too interesting lately so my tolerance has to drop or I need to stay away from the K lol.


Guy I got it from said he paid $20 for it and he and his friend had dipped it a few times already. They were street kids digging through a trash can at safeway. I walked up and offered them a bump of K since I was feeling good. They kicked the vial to me in exchange. It's not a lot of liquid, maybe 1ml. Guess I'll start evapping.

No erowids pretty good actually, sorry man, I'm mega fucked or I'd be more help. With PCP you can vape nearly any form really, it's just with certain chemicals it's best because of MP's, degradation, etc. No worries with the wet though!


My best advice is if you don't want to take the trouble, dip a cig yourself, and just start with small hits. With P, believe me youll know when your there!

I really enjoy the effects of PCP, and I regard myself as an inveterate or experienced user of this drug. Although I'm no neophyte with this drug, I've only ever administered PCP via intranasal and inhalational ROAs, with the HCL salt and the freebase forms, respectively. 


Recently, however, I have been interested in the exploration of different ROAs, namely IV and IM. Because this compound is so intense, I'm admittedly quite apprehensive and chickenshit about the idea of jumping right into the act of shooting up sherm, tout de suite, without knowing precisely what the hell I'd get myself into. 


So, seeing as how I'm far too pusillanimous to learn through my own experimentation, I am wondering if anyone could expound on the qualitative differences between, say, IV and intranasal routes of administration. I apologise if this topic has already been broached in this thread. I don't feel motivated enough to sift through 15 pages of discussion to figure out for sure if my comment is unique.

IV would be like instant anesthesia from my understanding. I would go the IM route, but you know HR, and all that.

Nothing, really... The only true but very minor differences were the two commas and the hyphen that I added to "mindbending". I sometimes make small adjustments when I quote posters.


Thanks for the interesting insights regarding your experience with psychedelics vis-à-vis ASPD. What you said seems logical and you may well be correct. On the other hand, I don't think that it's wise to assume that everyone with your condition can use these drugs safely, as the opposite could be the more likely scenario. We simply don't know, due to lack of scientific research and anecdotal reports, and therefore, taking great caution is advisable.


Incidentally, are you prescribed any medication for your ASPD? If so, which one(s) and for how long have you been taking it/them? Also, are you currently under the care of a psychologist and/or psychiatrist? Your mental adjustment seems to be essentially normal, so I wonder if you're dealing with any of the aforementioned or if you're going solo (i.e. "self-therapy").

Yeah, symptoms and severity of this condition do vary from person to person. The more impulsive types would probably be better off avoiding drugs.

My GP prescribed me low-dose citalopram 3 months ago to help "mellow me out" (his words)... it has had a subtle effect. At the time my anger issues were starting to affect my personal  relationships with the few people I actually do give a shit about  (people think we don't need *anybody* but this isn't true).


He told me there wasn't really anything else that he or the therapist could  do for me. I'm content with who I am and I have no desire to change my  way of  thinking. I want more out of life and I feel I'm entitled to  it. What I need to do is better my circumstances (i.e. find a better job,  get more money, have more sex) and stay away from people and situations  that piss me off.

I appreciate your frankness. I assume that you're still on the citalopram -- an SSRI. You probably already know that that class of drugs isn't safe to use in combination with psychedelics (except perhaps salvia divinorum, an atypical psychedelic), but I should mention it, just in case. Such mixtures can lead to serotonin syndrome, which can kill, if severe enough. SSRI's are especially dangerous when used in combination with aMT, 2C-T-7, ayahuasca, pharmahuasca, other MAOI's, DXM, ibogaine, tramadol and 5-HTP. Be very careful.

Yeah, I know certain drugs don't mix well with SSRIs.

The psychedelics you mention are pretty atypical in that they cause monoamine release (or act as MAOIs). This is where the danger comes from.


Classic psychedelics (LSD, shrooms, DMT, 2C-x etc.) are straight up 5-HT agonists and are perfectly safe to take with SSRIs... only problem is they can weaken the trip.

I would not call the classical psychedelics "perfectly safe" when used in combination with SSRI's. While such psychedelics are less risky than those which happen to also be monoamine releasers, such combinations can still lead to serotonin syndrome.


However, you're correct regarding SSRI's having a tendency to weaken trips. On the other hand, it's important to keep in mind that they can potentiate them, too.

PCP (phencyclidine in the following table):

[http://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads/649843-Binding-data-for-popular-arylcyclohexamines](https://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads/649843-Binding-data-for-popular-arylcyclohexamines)


binds to SERT, the serotonin transporter. 


It is not safe to mix serotonergic drugs like these, granted it is not that simple and people do use things like MDMA together with SSRI's, using PCP may be quite harmful. Especially when you have ASPD besides using SSRIs, you would do yourself a favor to avoid potent dissociatives like PCP.

And lamanogaucha is right: classical psychedelics are not exactly safe to mix with SSRI's and it is not true that they reliably just dull your trip. It can unexpectedly change or potentiate a trip and cause complications mentally. So take it really easy and if you can't avoid psychedelics (if I can use the term hallucinogens as a broader term).. really tone it down and stop using them when you observe that it makes your condition or functioning more problematic.


Arguably dissociatives can be worse when it comes to depersonalization and derealization, they can really wreak havoc on your sense of identity. I imagine that can do terrible things to ASPD, you don't want to isolate yourself too much. Stay a little grounded for your own good.


Trust me, I have experience with mental problems and using all sorts of drugs - you ought to want to take good care of yourself here. Also this is a harm reduction message board and it seems like our duty to warn you.

The same can be said for anybody, ASPD or not. I'm always careful with MXE - there is something very worrying about being so out of it and physically numb yet still able to walk around. It's not something I enjoy taking frequently or in huge doses TBH.


The propofol experience said it all. Contrary to what people like to believe, you don't have to be a complete nutjob to go loopy on anesthetics... it can and will happen to anybody at the right dose. I NEVER EVER lose my shit on psychedelics, weed, benzos or alcohol. The reason I fucked out on propofol wasn't because I have ASPD... it's because the drug robbed me of my consciousness (which is exactly what it's designed to do to a person) but the dose just wasn't quite strong enough to put me to sleep. This is a very dangerous and fucked up state for anybody to be in, regardless of personality.

Serotonin syndrome from LSD + SSRI's no, with SRI's like tramadol yes.


Still, the point is there are other unpleasant reactions to be had with SSRI's and psychedelics. People do seem to trip on them routinely, but I think I've read enough posts / heard enough to say that while the majority may experience dulled effects, it is certainly not with all. And it can turn into nasty interaction.


That dissociatives can cause anybody lots of problems is true but not a defense argument.


Just be real careful. Check the 3-MeO-PCP thread for example to see how many fuck-ups and hospitalizations people get, indeed even people who you think should know better. It is not to judge them, it can just be a very close call with dosing / redosing.

The eastern canadian "putty" that's about 20% pure used to make 10-15 bags of "mess" (cut with lactose), people know it's not mescaline, but it's ideal for snorting. That putty is very difficult to smoke when it is very hard, i've had it when it was oilier and was able to take a butter knife and spread some on a joint the last time I had a contact for it, circa fall 2008 and I can see how some would like it more smoked, but I think it's too dangerous the way its presented in america. Most people take random doses by smoking a pre-dipped "sherm" or w/e and its what causes most bad trips, way too much coming in at once will disturb some. Hell, snorting more than 2g of mess/mesc, which is made from 1g of "pure"/putty (the distributors are real smart in their increments. I don't know what the cut is for that 20-25% pure stuff but it is inert, it's white taking over almost completely the yellow natural colour of pcp. But then again, there was a lot of PCE also or mixes of PCP/PCE so maybe that why 2g of snorted mesc would throw me on my ass, which is like a matchead's worth of the putty before being mixed into lactose to make mad profit. (really thats the main point, they don't sell pure to just anybody, bad experiences doing so caused those who distribute it to carefully vet who gets to obtain the 1/15 (1 for 15 bags of mess) putty. It's also why it had such a bad reputation here in the early 2000's too, some people would take way too fucking much, I got stories that would make you laugh your ass off at how crazy/paranoid I've seen some people act (but mostly what they said). It doesn't incapacitate you as much as DXM that's for sure.

Full how? I'm a daily smoker and this would be my first time with pcp. I don't know how often I'd smoke one while intoxicated but I want to remain cautious if smoking were to be too much. Of course I'll know how this affects me later after the fact. The 3mg might be 4mg now. It is a nice white power that sticks to itself. I doubt it's cut very much. The stuff from the vial may be a different story.

Well first off let me state that I posted about it increasing the fullness thinking this was the 3-meo-pcp thread, but my experience has held true on both MXE and 3-meo-pcp so I'd be fairly confident in saying it holds true with pcp itself.


That being said, hmm... how to explain it... You know how on some chemicals, those that seem to not have a very broad receptor affinity, you can be really high but the experience feels either lacking in some way or just not "full"? Example: LSD feels like the perfect psychedelic to me, maybe it's just placebo since I know about it's pharmacology, but I can tell that it's just hitting so many receptors, it just feels like it's modulating everything it can. It's really "full". Nicotine (I use powerful e-cigs, not cigarettes) seems to add to the fullness feeling of MXE and 3-meo-pcp. I'll suddenly find myself feeling like something is missing, but as soon as I hit the e-cig it just bumps it up half a level and I no longer have the feeling of something missing.


Does that make sense?

I grew up in an area where PCP or dust/wet/sherm/illy whatever you want to call it, has been popular for decades.


I'm not sure why it's like this; but it has been for the last 45+ years, and still is hypothetically avaialble here if someone wants it since there is a demand for it.


I never used it but a lot of people I know did.


Nobody ever went crazy, or got violent on it like you hear about people doing or see them doing on youtube and in documentaries.  In high or moderate doses these people told me how it made movement difficult or almost impossible.


Since it's so common here when I was growing up as a teenager in the days when only schwag and mids were available and everyone smoked out of either a metal or wooden pipe long before vapes were around, I would get herb and have this older guy I knew who told me how he'd used PCP before a few times in the 70s and loved it take a hit of it first to make sure there was no dust on it.  He then told me how if it had been dusted herb I would know it since it really reaks like chems.


Other people I knew who smoked dust said how it just made them feel floaty, chill/relaxed, some would walk and stumble and slur their words and they said it felt like they were floating a bit above the ground.


One guy I knew who loved PCP turned out to be a major alcoholic and loved drugs that made him physically numb.


Someone else I knew who loved PCP said how they loved it since they love disassociative drugs like Ketamine, high doses of DXM, and this was long before MXE; but I'm sure he would have loved that.


I know someone who had never used PCP at all before and they used a lot of coke, and then intentionally smoked lots of hits of PCP out of a 2 foot acrylic grafix bong, and they said how that night they thought they had literally died, or were a zombie; but how they did not want to repeat the experience; but were glad that they had done it.  This guy also said how at times he was so sedated from it he thought he was going to pass out.


I know someone else who snorted some at a live concert and thought they were going to pass out.


Someone else I knew smoked a bowl of it or a few hits and they watched a movie and had an out of body experience where they were watching themselves watch the movie from above their body.


The older guy I know who loved it when he used it in the 70s a few times said how it made him feel very, very sedated or down, or all messed up, and how he drew a very good portrait of Jimmy Page on it, and he has no real artistic ability at all when sober or on other drugs.


I know one dust head who used way too much of it as a teenager; but he was always sort of different or 'off' in a way.  I have no idea if he uses PCP as an adult as I haven't seen him in a very long time.

I'm thinking that I may have possibly gotten ahold of PCP mistankely

Friend of mine broke into a vet office and stole a couple of bottles of what was suppose to be ketamine.....they dries it out( it was in a liquid form) and it ended up a powder....like 5 people sat down and did like 1/4 gram lines and they all passed out for about 9-12 hours. So we tried it In smaller amounts through the next month, almost always with the same result .....falling asleep.....in retrospect I think it may have been a stronger tranquilizer....I wish we would of just dipped a cig in the original liquid and tried that! We may have been sitting on a goldmine,.....ended up giving it all away.....it ended up making like a 1/2 ounce of powder

PCP is not used by vets in vials afaik....


Check if it has [xylazine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xylazine) in it besides K, try reading the label next time? Tiletamine is another possibility I guess. Strange that people are interested in passing out for half a day.


Don't try to smoke aqueous ketamine... and especially not K with xylazine, that could get dangerous next to harmful to your resp sys. If the effects are not making sense with what they are supposed to be, how could you not check it out as opposed to giving it away to other people - it seems incredibly irresponsible.

I've gotten products in the street that were supposed to be just like K, but 'stronger' and i've heard them being referred to as elephant tranquilizers... Same reaction, passed right out with no trip at all. Throw that stuff right away, it's probably a tranquilizer.

PCP is not used as even an animal anesthetic. It's only used to research things like NMDA receptors and mouse or primate models of schizophrenia/drug addiction/drug discrimination.


I think Telazol (tiletamine + zolazepam) is the "elephant tranquilizer" sold on the streets. 'Cause it's a dissociative plus a benzo it is way more prone to blackouts than either alone. (That's something you want in a drug for sedating animals, but not really for a recreational drug.)


Either that or it's MXE. But Telazol is sold in vials as far as I know, (just like ketamine is) and even MXE doesn't cause blackouts with 100% frequency (unless you push your dosage).


Ketamine is still used in veterinary settings and for certain human indications (children undergoing minor surgery, paramedic usage before arrival at hospital and switch to a better anesthetic, rapid depression treatment) wherever it's not restricted by law. The number of places that control ketamine closely grows by the day.

No it's not- maybe it could be, but no PCP has been made for medical use since the '60s (? Maybe earlier). 


That said a fair bit of PCP is still made for research/analytical use, it's not that uncommon to come across it in university labs and such like. In addition it's probably one of the few drugs worth stealing from such a lab, as you're unlikely to have access to more than 50mg- half a point of 99% pure MDMA is still fuck all, half a point of 99%pure PCP is ~5-20 doses.

**limonov**,


Following your suggestions, one would be risking getting charged for trespassing, forced entry, vandalism, burglary, and drug possession, at least. I'd presume that would result in at least a felony conviction or a stint of no less than a year in a penitentiary. 


Besides, phencyclidine is incredibly easy to synthesise. There's no rationale for having to steal this drug. And the only reason one should ever burglarise a university's chemistry laboratory is to acquire the necessary equipment (glassware, analytical balances, personal safety equipment, other lab accoutrements) to start up your own operation.

Smoked about 4mg pcp a little bit ago. Not feeling a whole lot. Was wondering if i is safe to do ketamine on top of it if things dont progress.


EDIT: I did some weak ghb last night. Did that cause these weak effects'?


EDIT 2: Last dissociative use was two weeks ago. High tolerance to k from the week before that. Did it alot for several days to a week. Long lasting tolerance?  Coulda just fucked myself there?

**Help me with understanding the drug "WET"**


I need some clarity on exactly what it is that gets people high when smoking a wet, dipper, stick etc. I am with the understanding that it is embalm fluid laced with pcp. Yet i see embalm fl being called pcp as its slang name. Does embalm fluid, when smoked as a wet cigarette, get you high? I want to know if it is simply taking the embalm and dipping a cig in it and smoking it or does it have to have the pcp chemical as well. I live in an area where it's very popular and I want to understand exactly what I'm dealing with since I live around it. TY  Please avoid opinions on this because we all have plenty of them. I want someone that knows for a fact or has experienced it.

Wet, dust, and the rest of the slang terms are just terms for the drug PCP.


I've never used it but lots of my friends have as it's very common in the city where I grew up and has been for decades.  Nobody ever went crazy, or got violent on it.  In low doses my peers/friends said it would make them feel as though they were floating or even flying when walking or when the one guy I knew jumped off a parked car after smoking it.  At moderate, and high doses my friends said it made them sort of become an outside observer to themselves, they had trouble walking, moving, and would slur their words.


I know someone else who snorted some that was in powder format and they thought it was a different drug, and they said how it made them feel very sedated and almost pass out.  Another person I know who is an alcoholic actually loved PCP since he said it made him feel very numb like large quantities of alcohol did.


"Embalming fluid" is just a slang term.  Actual embalming fluids including formaldehyde will not get you high if you use or take them.


People dip cigs into liquid PCP and smoke it that way.  Or the liquid PCP will be put onto mint leaves, parsley, or onto really low-quality cannabis or herb and people smoke it that way.  It's not really actual embalming fluid as I posted about above.  My friends that have used PCP told me how when it's on herb or something else you can easily tell since it smells like chemicals, and it's not like regular cannabis.


Erowid has a lot of info on PCP.


This is a thread about PCP that's got a lot of info in it.

TY for a better understanding. You said in low doses so are you referring to a wet cigarette? So if wet is a term for pcp then where does the embalm fluid come in at? What part does embalm fluid play when they dip them cigarettes and is that what's getting them high?

There is no embalming fluid in it. It is just a nickname. Embalming fluids such as formaldehyde are poisons, PCP is a dissociative drug and not anything alike or related to any embalming fluids.

There's no formaldehyde or embalming fluid at all in PCP.  It's just a slang term for it like wet, sherm, dust, etc.


In the late 60s and all through the 70s people would sell PCP as THC powder or claim it was a cannabinoid.

Yeah, in eastern canada, pcp was pretty much the meth of the area, there was meth but the bikers mostly kept it to themselves, and it was crank not crystal no way.


So yes, man those "TH" pills made it up into the late 90's here, but the most popular way to do it was with low dosed cut to the max (with safe stuff, mostly lactose, sometimes quinine or powder sugar). I already explained how it worked before so I'm not gonna go around it, but lets just say when one person had the trust of somebody, they would get "grams" of "pure", I count it as 20% pure or so, came as a kind of yellowish white paste, the more liquidish, the better, people would envelope it in foil and you wouldn't lose any, it was sticky. But the point was mostly to bring up 15 grams or so of lactose and cut that stuff into 15 grams which went for uh, well, let's just say the person doing this was making was making about between 175% to 250% profit if they didn't use and sold it as seperate grams, depending on how they would cut it. My weed dealer then would go on binges and not touch it for a while, but was also a crazy mofo who made 7 grams with the stuff, when you could still see the yellow in your 1g "mesc" bag, you knew it was strong shit and you had better be careful


That's what I call low dose PCP. Not those sherms, even if you have the real liquid and put it in there. Not only does smoking PCP acts differently as when you're eating or snorting it, it's pretty stimulant at low doses. Just when Fight Club came out some of my friends would snort a "gram" or two of "mess/mesc"(pcp is the most misrepresented drug ever, nobody usually wants it, but some people happen to enjoy it so in those circles they know its just a nickname and not mescaline. They would punch each other in the face for laughs because they felt the analgesia that PCP procures, which is pretty high, and considering that, from the best sources I had then, the really pure stuff, which they called 1-100, which meant 1 gram of the stuff, contained a little heroin, just to add in the addiction factor, people wouldn't notice it, as I guess they'd get the effect of a 10mg morphine pill with their pcp or maybe even less, but to people who dont abuse opioids, its a good trap to make a not so addictive substance, suddenly addictive, and no this isn't like the mdma contains heroin bullshit which really makes no sense. (it was pure liquid, but they always put it on something solid for some reason, ghetto methods for sure, lets say that pcp was most popular in the bad area of my town, which for I imagine an American is a normal area...but anyway, thats where when pcp was getting more rare and rare, same as for LSD, meth pills flooded the whole place, those people only enjoyed their E when there was a mix of MDMA and speed so the comedown wasn't so abrupt and depressive, and yep, it worked, so they started making white pills which mean speed, the coloured ones are MDxx or 2-cb around here, its not just random rambling, you can look it up on pillreports. 


Anyway, no, smoking a random amount from liquid is not a low dose. These 1g bags of "mesc", that was low dose, you wouldn't get the stimulant effect from it if eating it only, snorting did so, more so in other people than me. I was always the voice of reason back then, always able to pull people from doing stupid shit while on psychedelics, I had cable modem in '99,so I knew of Erowid which was one hell of a good resource. These days there's too much (mostly stupid) chemicals for them to keep up. anyway...


Smoking a whole sherm, or some ditch weed sprayed with liquid pcp like I heard so much about is used in the US, are not low doses. The people who were (are?, haven't seen or used PCP since 2008, and it was really great stuff, 1-50 (means it makes 50g of mess if you want to go that route, mostly the people not using much and selling would do th at). I made the experience with that stuff, since it was liquid enough, I rolled a joint, then picked a butter knife and buttered it up with the pcp liquidish putty. And oh boy did I get what some say is the most fun thing about PCP, I got this insane boost in my mood, my physical woes disappeared, and me and the friend I did this with later both couldn't stand still so we made a huge ball of foil and went into that primary school close to where I used to live late at night and play "basketball" with it laughing like maniacs. If you go overboard through all ROA's though, you'll speak like someone with parkison's for a while and maybe get into a pee hole, which I'm glad I never was reckless enough to try to get to (people eating whole grams of that 20% or so pure stuff, eating PCP is another level.


I remember an old friend did that and he was lying in his bed, terrified, 3 days later, still not coming down and his mom was telling him "You messed up, you'll be like this forever now". What a bitch, the guy took a 1 year and a half certification in Janitorial Studies (I'm joking about the name, I don't how it's called, but to be a janitor where it pays, like for the city, unionized and all, you need that diploma, from these school, I seriously don't know how to call 'em, some programs ask for only 10th grade education (being a butcher), 11th grade and some full on 12th grade with advanced maths. They don't go to college after that, they take a "DEP" which in my province means "Diplôme D'études Professionnelles", which is what people who don't want to go to college do, my mom has one of those for Cooking and even has an ASP, a specialization in banquets. I'm sure there's a name for that for you most US users of BL, but also the rest of Canada, I'm not sure how they do it, Education is a Province's Responsibility/Right, so it works differently everywhere, even more in Quebec..but that's just some more cultural differences, tangential, I know, but all this to say, no, the guy didn't have the genes to become schizophrenic after a bad psych/dissociative experience at around 20 years old. I know I'm not schizophrenic, but the other stuff I got, well I delayed it, when weed worked for me. If I was schizophrenic and had eaten all the LSD I had eaten during those years, I'd probably not be typing this here. 


So just wanted to end this on a positive note, the guy's fine now, more fine than me with my college education and all that BS but that's unrelated circumstances, I say it's really rare for somebody to end up fucked up forever because of psychedelics, dissociative or not. I say that and I did get HPPD from the loads of LSD and surprise buttsex a DOB blotter did to me which left me uneasy for a good 3 months, which while a mere annoyance, the HPPD that is, was needed to be cured, which for once something does cure it, but it was clonazepam. Now that's dangerous stuff...![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif)

I've never tried it myself. I've heard it is neurotoxic even at regular recreational doses. Not entirely sure about that though. If it's like other dissociatives, I would imagine it's probably highly addictive for certain people whereas others might find it detestable. Side effects of repeated, large doses of dissociatives have been known to cause organ and brain damage. Not sure what you mean by worth it. Personally I'm pretty curious about it but given my track record with dissos I don't think I can be trusted to dose responsibly with it.

I came across PCP ONE TIME and it was sold to me under the slang term "Sherm Stick" in the Philly area.  Basically for $20, I got a Newport cigarette soaked to the filter in what smelled like paint thinner...The dealer advised me to rip off the filter and light the cigarette off of another lit cigarette so it wouldn't ignite...I must also add that I wasn't seeking PCP, I just stumbled across it...believe it or not, it is still a VERY popular drug in the Northeast....


When I got to my apartment, my brother and I took a few drags off the sheer stick and entered a 6 hour VERY intense high that was similar to ketamine and nitrous but with more stimulating effects and physical sides like overheating... It's funny because I took my clothes off and I always saw guys on tv naked under the influence of PCP....the next day we felt terrible...We ended up calling the sherm sticks "retard sticks"....It was a scary experience.

Yeah, street PCP is normally pretty dirty and damn near impossible to judge doses with. Now 3-meo-PCP if you have a good vendor can be really fucking great...but if you're like me it's compulsive as fuck, and a gram is A LOT to have on hand when 10mgs is plenty for most, and nothing good comes from going over 50mgs even if you're an old disso head like me . . . 

Man I was convinced for days that I would travel the coast in a bicycle that pulls taffy as I ride and this would solve all of my financail woes and would be a practical mode of transportation... Felt good, but had to toss the other half gram before I got any worse. 

It can feel like nothing else, manic and happy with great fantasy, no pain that matters at all....when it goes sideways though it can go real sideways, and yeah not too many intelegent people about who have been using PCP since the 70s. . . 

So it's up to you to decide if it's worth it or not.

Now if I could source a point of good clean pcp I would be all over it. I wouldn't want more on hand though.

I have smoked PCP a total of 3 times in my life. The first time I smoked 2 pcp blunts with 3 friends and completely knocked myself out for about 1.5 hours, like had to be dragged out of the room we smoked it in once they decided to change rooms. In my mind I had wild adventures and was watching fireworks etc. The first thing i asked upon coming out of my coma was "did i call my mother, no, are the cops here, no, good" Then i asked what time it was and my friend said "1030" which was still early and i kept going "1030... what does that mean, 1030?" because we smoked it around 9 and i wanted to make sure it wasnt really late as i still live with my parents. Not so much that they keep me on a short leash but they go to sleep at 2am if im lucky, walking in late invites questions of "what did you do tonight, did you have fun, etc" so coming home early means at most i get the "oh your home early" and i can go "yeah" and walk off lol. I end up looking like a crazed insane person when i am on dissociatives so avoiding the wide eyed bugged out, perhaps slurring speech stuff that would get questioned if i were later then normal 


All and all its a pretty heavy and debilitating experience. It was great but the lingering effects make it hard to do much for hours after doing it, i mean like driving and complicated tasks are impossible and you will have triple vision if you dose high enough. I repeated the experience 2 other times in way lower amounts and its just not the drug for me i prefer ketamine and nitrous. The comparison is that ketamine feels cleaner and makes me way more content. So a dose of ketamine doesnt last as long and produces more of a relaxing mental effect. Nitrous is great for short acting intensifier but pcp requires planning in my mind.


I am fairly sure all dissociatives have a type of "hole" if you go deep enough, one of their functions is to do just that, remove the body from the mind in a sense.

Basically for $20, I got a Newport cigarette soaked to the filter in what smelled like paint thinner...The dealer advised me to rip off the filter and light the cigarette off of another lit cigarette so it wouldn't ignite...I must also add that I wasn't seeking PCP, I just stumbled across it...believe it or not, it is still a VERY popular drug in the Northeast....

It's funny because I took my clothes off and I always saw guys on tv naked under the influence of PCP....the next day we felt terrible...We ended up calling the sherm sticks "retard sticks"....It was a scary experience.

Yeah PCP is all over the Northeast and it's popular in Philadelphia/NYC/NJ/Baltimore/DC.


This article is propaganda and PCP is not "new" like it claims but if you want dust in the tri-state area it's not difficult to find.  I talked to older drug users who had used PCP in the mid 70s and they said how it had been popular then in the 70s; but it was popular in PA/NJ/NYC/DC/Baltimore since the late 60s.


[http://www.thedailybeast.com/articl...ew-rise-of-a-drug-that-turns-teens-crazy.html](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2011/04/22/pcp-the-new-rise-of-a-drug-that-turns-teens-crazy.html)


I personally have never used PCP, and never want to. But I grew up with a lot of people who did.  Only one person was a dust head, and the rest would just smoke it when someone else had some and wanted to get dusted smoking a bowl, joint, blunt, etc.  the people I know who smoked dust said how they would only smoke maybe 1-2 hits off of a joint or blunt of dusted herb and that this would make them feel as though they were floating and movement became very difficult.  The few people I know who smoked it intentionally in high doses said how they had thought that they had died and were basically a zombie and would stumble around, and everything was confusing for them.


Nobody I know who has used dust or PCP even the people who used it in high doses, did anything crazy like becoming violent, or hurt themselves or other people.  People either loved it, or hated it.

I'd personally be interested too, but wonder whether those experienced with both find PCP special compared to 3-MeO-PCP?

Maybe holding 2-oxo-PCE up against MXE could give a hint? Seems the 3-MeO makes AChA's more recreational but less hard core? Or what? I'm just guessing from what I've read. I haven't tried 2-oxo-PCE myself yet. I kind of never got around to it, and suddenly it didn't seem that appealing honestly.

Travel to a bad área of a major city in the Northeast, or go to DC, or to Oakland, Fresno, or South Central if you are on the west coast. It is probably in Denver as well. Tell the home boys, vatos, and carnales you want to get wet. You will be able to find it, if you hypothetically want it.  Stay safe.

I've done a gram of 2 oxo pce and I like it. Based off my two trials with 3 meo pce it is more similiar to o pce than 3 meo pcp (obviously).

I am still in early trials with the 3 meo pce, but I think 2 oxo pce is closer to mxe, Though nothing really holds a candle :-( Too bad I just did my last o pce or I could combine? 


If you have tried 3 meo pce and liked it, give 2 oxo pce a shot. I like both of them more than 3 meo pcp I think. That being said there are situations I would rather have 3 meo pcp.


As for the actual thread. If someone said "I'll sell you 100mg of pure PCP for a reasonable price" I'd buy it just to try it. Why not? Then I can choose an exact dose and ramp up instead of "getting wet".


Except it's never sold that way so I doubt I'll ever try it.

I never used PCP or angel dust, wet, love boat, illy, sherm, 'embalming fluid', etc. Given how in vogue it was when I was a teen and adult and how in the city I grew up in how common it was I am surprised. A lot of people who I grew up with used it, had tried it once or maybe two or three times. Or would smoke some if someone had some on weed and everyone wanted to get wet. Nobody became violent, went crazy, or had the police called on them.  There was one dust head but he died from heroin/opiates, or coke and not PCP.


How did the angel-dust make you feel?

I dunno, blazin!

Seems like this is not a particularly active thread but... does anyone know the best reagent kit(s) for determining the presence of PCP in a powder sample? Dancesafe and Bunk Police were surprisingly lacking info in this area.

I find it weird that pcp never got big outside some rare spots mostly in ghettos.

With the popularity of ket there should be some niche pcp culture like there is for lsd or other substances.

I have always wanted to try PCP, it sounds amazing, but I don't really want to do it in the typical fashion of dipped cigarettes of unknown strength.  I'd rather have pure PCP I could weigh and dose.  However I have never come across it... in fact I have never even come across dipped cigarettes, though I also haven't really looked seriously.  I am also puzzled by how niche it is, considering how many people love dissociatives.

PCP or Angel dust did become popular outside of slums or ghettos, it was popular in the late 1960s, and for sure in the 1970s, 1980s, 1990s, and early 2000s. I am certain that people still smoke it, snort the powder, and the people who love disassociative drugs like PCP, K, or DXM buy it and use it.

Haha, yes.  


I miss the old days of Bluelight meetups.  I actually never went to one because during those times I was still with my ex, who was convinced anyone on the internet was an axe murderer, and forbade me from ever meeting any BLers (except the ones who moved to my town and became our best friends - you'd think that would have changed her mind, but no)

Yeah I remember hearing about that, so fucked up.  As I understand, in Europe there were many successful meetups though.  Personally I have met a decent number of BLers by this point and it has always ranged from interesting to awesome.  Three of them (though one deceased, RIP Erin ![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif)) live in the same town as me and we're basically family now, we will grow old together as close friends.

Would love some initiated commentary on PCP vs analogues.


They all seem to share roughly the same potency. Someone back in this thread called 3-MeO-PCP bunk. I've found a couple of analogues to be quite pleasant, but never tried the original.


Any guesses about varying affinities etc? More or less DRI in the analogues? SRI negligible or relevant?


Are there ways to know variance in efficacy across varying brain regions for the same receptor type, like NMDA?


...And what is the hard limit on asking stuff here instead of joining a biochemistry course? :D

I know it's off topic, but that sounds really cool, and i for myself would find it totally awesome to have sum ppl from this forum around me, which sadly isn't the case...


But yeah, I'm from the EU, so perhaps there's a meetup someday soon and I probably find sum cool ppl from this place, at best even from the same country - who knows?

3-meo-pcp may be the most fiendish and hedonistic substance I've ever come across. I'm about 3 weeks clean after a 3 month long binge where I was using it daily. That shit is so goddamn cheap and easy to find, and so potent, that I never ran the risk of running out. I was doing 20-60mg a day, usually doing a line right when I woke up, another at lunch time, and more once I got home from work. The mania I experienced the first few days I did it was incredible and really kicked my ass into gear, I made many lifestyle/hygeine improvements and deep cleaned my entire apartment over the span of a couple days. But over time that mania gave way to depression, I kept taking more to try to push myself back into mania, and it just became this vicious cycle of short-lived mania followed by rebound depression. My family, employer, coworkers, etc had/still have no idea I've ever tried PCP or any of it's analogues, it was so unusually functional for me no matter what dose I took. I'm autistic and dissociatives tend to help me in a similar way that amphetamines do for people with ADHD. But this substance was slowly ruining my life because it gave me an affordable way to be on dissociatives 24/7.


Odd thing about 3-meo-pcp is that I never once experienced any sort of psychedelia from it. Never anything even resembling a hole. I would take 50mg and just black out or end up in a catatonic state where I could not speak or interact with others.

I blacked out and did an unknown amount while in public right before I was given an intervention by my best friend and got rid of my stash. I used to load up about 200-300mg in a plastic vial and bring it with me everywhere and just eyeball out lines of it. I have no idea how much I took that night but I was completely unresponsive but awake for hours, eventually came to and I was in an uber headed home. I felt intense depersonalization and agoraphobia for about 3 days following that experience. I'm feeling better now, still can responsibly enjoy ket and other more productive dissos. Strangely enough I'm craving stims all of the time now, despite the fact that I have very little history of stimulant usage.


Also I must say, I'm upset with myself for trying 3-meo-pcp because now I feel like I will not / should not enjoy 3-HO-PCP in the way I did in the past. 3-HO-PCP was right up there with ketamine as my DOC. 3-HO was warm yet energetic, potent, psychedelic, and even had hole potential when combined with 2C-B. But now I may have ruined PCP analogues forever, and my close friends are keeping an eye on me and likely will be worried if I decide to revisit 3-HO-PCP despite the fact I never had a full-blown addiction to it in the way that I did with 3-meo.

Yeah 3-MeO-PCP is a weird one.  It's very moreish but it gives delusions of sobriety similar to benzos, where you can be acting absolutely batshit crazy and be convinced you're operating at your best and just feeling good and "super-sober".  A good friend of mine spent the last year or so of her life as a different person, pretty much.  I believe it was exacerbating a personality disorder and was worsened by benzo addiction, too, but she was on benzos for years before the 3-MeO without nearly so dramatic an effect.  She became awful, manipulative, histrionic... all her loved ones avoided her whenever possible, she was a nightmare.  It culminated in her overdosing and dying from "heroin" (came back fentanyl, of course).  It was extremely tragic and horrible.

I already explained how it worked before so I'm not gonna go around it, but lets just say when one person had the trust of somebody, they would get "grams" of "pure", I count it as 20% pure or so, came as a kind of yellowish white paste, the more liquidish, the better, people would envelope it in foil and you wouldn't lose any, it was sticky. But the point was mostly to bring up 15 grams or so of lactose and cut that stuff into 15 grams which went for uh, well, let's just say the person doing this was making was making about between 175% to 250% profit if they didn't use and sold it as seperate grams, depending on how they would cut it. My weed dealer then would go on binges and not touch it for a while, but was also a crazy mofo who made 7 grams with the stuff, when you could still see the yellow in your 1g "mesc" bag, you knew it was strong shit and you had better be careful
>

> 
> That's what I call low dose PCP. Not those sherms, even if you have the real liquid and put it in there. Not only does smoking PCP acts differently as when you're eating or snorting it, it's pretty stimulant at low doses. Just when Fight Club came out some of my friends would snort a "gram" or two of "mess/mesc"(pcp is the most misrepresented drug ever, nobody usually wants it, but some people happen to enjoy it so in those circles they know its just a nickname and not mescaline. They would punch each other in the face for laughs because they felt the analgesia that PCP procures, which is pretty high, and considering that, from the best sources I had then, the really pure stuff, which they called 1-100, which meant 1 gram of the stuff, contained a little heroin, just to add in the addiction factor, people wouldn't notice it, as I guess they'd get the effect of a 10mg morphine pill with their pcp or maybe even less, but to people who dont abuse opioids, its a good trap to make a not so addictive substance, suddenly addictive, and no this isn't like the mdma contains heroin bullshit which really makes no sense. (it was pure liquid, but they always put it on something solid for some reason, ghetto methods for sure, lets say that pcp was most popular in the bad area of my town, which for I imagine an American is a normal area...but anyway, thats where when pcp was getting more rare and rare, same as for LSD, meth pills flooded the whole place, those people only enjoyed their E when there was a mix of MDMA and speed so the comedown wasn't so abrupt and depressive, and yep, it worked, so they started making white pills which mean speed, the coloured ones are MDxx or 2-cb around here, its not just random rambling, you can look it up on pillreports.
> 
> 
> 
> Anyway, no, smoking a random amount from liquid is not a low dose. These 1g bags of "mesc", that was low dose, you wouldn't get the stimulant effect from it if eating it only, snorting did so, more so in other people than me. I was always the voice of reason back then, always able to pull people from doing stupid shit while on psychedelics, I had cable modem in '99,so I knew of Erowid which was one hell of a good resource. These days there's too much (mostly stupid) chemicals for them to keep up. anyway...

> Smoking a whole sherm, or some ditch weed sprayed with liquid pcp like I heard so much about is used in the US, are not low doses. The people who were (are?, haven't seen or used PCP since 2008, and it was really great stuff, 1-50 (means it makes 50g of mess if you want to go that route, mostly the people not using much and selling would do th at). I made the experience with that stuff, since it was liquid enough, I rolled a joint, then picked a butter knife and buttered it up with the pcp liquidish putty. And oh boy did I get what some say is the most fun thing about PCP, I got this insane boost in my mood, my physical woes disappeared, and me and the friend I did this with later both couldn't stand still so we made a huge ball of foil and went into that primary school close to where I used to live late at night and play "basketball" with it laughing like maniacs. If you go overboard through all ROA's though, you'll speak like someone with parkison's for a while and maybe get into a pee hole, which I'm glad I never was reckless enough to try to get to (people eating whole grams of that 20% or so pure stuff, eating PCP is another level.

What a bitch, the guy took a 1 year and a half certification in Janitorial Studies (I'm joking about the name, I don't how it's called, but to be a janitor where it pays, like for the city, unionized and all, you need that diploma, from these school, I seriously don't know how to call 'em, some programs ask for only 10th grade education (being a butcher), 11th grade and some full on 12th grade with advanced maths. They don't go to college after that, they take a "DEP" which in my province means "Diplôme D'études Professionnelles", which is what people who don't want to go to college do, my mom has one of those for Cooking and even has an ASP, a specialization in banquets. I'm sure there's a name for that for you most US users of BL, but also the rest of Canada, I'm not sure how they do it, Education is a Province's Responsibility/Right, so it works differently everywhere, even more in Quebec..but that's just some more cultural differences, tangential, I know, but all this to say, no, the guy didn't have the genes to become schizophrenic after a bad psych/dissociative experience at around 20 years old. I know I'm not schizophrenic, but the other stuff I got, well I delayed it, when weed worked for me. If I was schizophrenic and had eaten all the LSD I had eaten during those years, I'd probably not be typing this here.

I say that and I did get HPPD from the loads of LSD and surprise buttsex a DOB blotter did to me which left me uneasy for a good 3 months, which while a mere annoyance, the HPPD that is, was needed to be cured, which for once something does cure it, but it was clonazepam.

Its the same where im from most of the time but it comes in these little amber vials and one is enough for a smallish blunt. But usually i would put in two of them and get stuck for awhile after id be finishing it. But i really liked that feeling and i never did anything sketchy. When i would use only one i would crave more and end up rolling another shortly after anyways. That said i take large doses of Dissos in general compared to most people so that is deff a factor in there. 


Ive never bought it as liquid to dip but i know people that have. Id honestly not wanna do that cuz i dont smoke cigarettes or weed and would rather not dip something like that. Id really love for an RC vendor to make this stuff someday and acquire a gram of the pure compound. That way i could dose the stuff orally with accuaracy.

back when i did the stuff, it'd be a liquid in an amber vial... i never saw it on mint leaves, but a few of my elders told me they used to get it in the 80s on mint leaves (they called it "love boat", maybe only it was on weed? yeah, i think weed+pcp was love boat). 


anyway, the vials (solution of pcp + diethyl  ether) were big enough to dip maybe 4 cigs? been a few years, can't remember for sure. some ppl add everclear and my buddy could tell and would call them out on it. i liked to dip american spirits cause i'm a hipster i guess lol...


my buddy would dip spice blunts (synthetic cannabinoids), and we would smoke em and get totally zonked... prolly some of the highest times i remember (not quite on the level of salvia or dmt, but not far off either... totally inside out and upside down)... just lay there on a motel bed or a park bench. 


side note, i know the show " love boat" was popular and that's why the oldtimers *say *they called it that, but lemme tell ya... NOTHING and i mean NOTHING beats having sex while on a combo of weed and a dissociative. lsd kinda comes close (when it's even possible to get it up), but my theory is that the weed+pcp combo is called "love boat" for this reason. it's just too uncanny of a coincidence imo, to not be related.

Here in New York PCP is very popular in the inner city neighborhoods. Usually you would get mint leaves soaked in the PCP for 10 dollars a bag. It's only enough to roll one blunt, but depending on how potent it is, it can be a hell of an experience. I've smoked it a handful of times and two dimebags of it is my sweet spot. I mean there was one time it was potent enough where I only took 2 hits and I was high as a kite. The first time I smoked it I smoked two blunts and I got stuck, I froze up like a statue and I became catatonic like. I didn't know where I was and I didn't know what was going on, I left my body and went somewhere else. I blacked out and then came to at a bus stop and everything looked like a cartoon in a way, similar to DXM vision. I totally forgot I even smoked PCP and the guy I was with had to remind me that we smoked two blunts. About a year and a half after my dad died I smoked two blunts again of the dust and I forgot my dad had died and in a way I thought he was still alive. Life feels so unreal on it.ive always wondered why it's considered a ghetto drug.

Yeah weed + PCP is called the love boat. I used to get the mint leaves soaked in the dust but I wouldn't put it on my weed, I smoked the leaves straight in a blunt. And spice blunts dipped in PCP must have been hell of a trip. There was one time I smoked two blunts of straight PCP and then about an hour or hour and a half later I smoked a blunt of spice and I was wrecked

Yeah, I would have to say wet weed is underrated. There's so much untrue information about it. When I smoke wet I feel like I'm flying through outerspace and I see cartoonish hallucinations with my eyes closed. I also hear wacky beeping noises beeping over and over again. To me PCP is totally awesome.

I get the cartoon vision from dust, like everything looks animated or fake. When I smoke wet, I smoke it straight with no weed, but I was always curious to how the high is when you put the mint leaves on top of weed. I heard people say that the weed makes the wet less intense but I don't see how that can be. I've also heard people say that smoking it with weed makes it more hallucinogenic. Like I said I've only smoked PCP straight.

I’ve read some people claiming combo with weed increases chances for psychosis. PCP is one of rare things that’s specific for USA scene that I wouldn’t mind. Tho issues with PCP addiction and likelihood of psychosis are reasons ketamine replaced it. Sure by now it’s shown how ketamine can be very addictive and physical harm is real when abused. What would worry me more if someone I know would switch from abusing ketamine to abusing PCP is bigger chance it’s neurotoxic. It’s more proven that K is pretty light on the brain than that PCP is really neurotoxic (and more importantly irreversibly) at normal doses but that’s still an open question.

I always wondered if the love boat slang for it was from the old TV show? 


In the Northeast where I am from nobody called it that they called it angel dust, dust, wet, Sherm, dips (or sold it on Newports dipped into vials), and embalming fluid yeah it isn't formaldehyde but some people who think it is steal actual formaldehyde.

was this in the 80s? that's when the term 'love boat' was used, pretty sure. i think it has probably not been called that for a long time now.

Yeah the only people ive heard say that really are older heads when they are talking about the past and using it back in the day. All of the people ive ever dealt with call it dust or wet. It pretty wild that the gang members in the hood smoke that stuff and then shoot at eachother and shit. When i do PCP i feel so euphoric and in lovey dovey mode. I have profound insights and seem like im on the verge of a breakthru, uncovering the truths of life and our universe. Its very psychedelic for me.

Yipper, I remember those terms and people using.  The stuff was all over the North East.  It probably still is.  Early on, like in the 70's mushrooms were not as abundant as they are in 2023.  In fact they were rare.  People really would buy store bought mushrooms and sprinkle PCP on them to pass them off as genuine mushrooms..  Thankfully that is not what happens today and people know how to grow mushrooms now.  PCP was wrapped in different names.  I even heard crystal T.  Suppose to be crystal THC lol.  But it was just PCP.  You almost had to duck as the stuff was all over.  I never really like it.  I think I had a few hits once but looking that far back is a blur.


Comfortably Numb is for sure opiates.   One of the best opiate songs.

Well... I'm just wondering why there's such a difference between the effects of Dissociatives ? Besides PCP and Ketamine, which I like. There's nasty Dissociatives such as DXM. And then there's ones that make you feel like your in Heaven such as Nitrous Oxide. They all effect the NMDA receptors, But they all feel so different. Why would that be ?

Im assuming its differences in the binding affinities at the NDMA receptor and also what other receptors they hit has well. Not all dissos only hit the NMDA receptor only many a number of them play around with Seratonin like MXE and family. PCP releases dopamine and other stuff as well. DXM is a stronger SSRI than a disso and just a really gross drug honestly, very dangerous in combo with alot of stuff. Horrible bodyload, its the worse disso in my opinion.
