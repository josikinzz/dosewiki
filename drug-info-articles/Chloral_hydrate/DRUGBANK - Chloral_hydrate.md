# Chloral hydrate
*Source: https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB01563*

## Overview

### Description

This compound belongs to the class of organic compounds known as chlorohydrins. These are alcohols substituted by a chlorine atom at a saturated carbon atom otherwise bearing only hydrogen or hydrocarbyl groups.

### Background

A hypnotic and sedative used in the treatment of insomnia. The safety margin is too narrow for chloral hydrate to be used as a general anesthetic in humans, but it is commonly used for that purpose in animal experiments. It is no longer considered useful as an anti-anxiety medication.

### Indication

Mainly used as a hypnotic in the treatment of insomnia; however, it is only effective as a hypnotic for short-term use. May be used as a routine sedative preoperatively to decrease anxiety and cause sedation and/or sleep with respiration depression or cough reflex.

### Absorption

Rapidly absorbed in the GI tract following oral or rectal administration. Chloral hydrate and its active metabolite, trichloroethanol, have been detected in CSF, umbilical cord blood, fetal blood, and amniotic fluid.

### Metabolism

Metabolized by the liver and erythrocytes to form trichloroethanol, an active metabolite. This reaction is catalyzed by alcohol dehydrogenase and other enzymes. Oxidation of chloral hydrate and trichloroethanol to trichloroacetic acid in the liver and kidneys also occurs to a lesser extent. Trichloroethanol also undergoes glucuronidation to produce an inactive metabolism.

### Drug Interactions

This information should not be interpreted without the help of a healthcare provider. If you believe you are experiencing an interaction, contact a healthcare provider immediately. The absence of an interaction does not necessarily mean no interactions exist.

1,2-Benzodiazepine
The risk or severity of CNS depression can be increased when Chloral hydrate is combined with 1,2-Benzodiazepine.
Abacavir
Abacavir may decrease the excretion rate of Chloral hydrate which could result in a higher serum level.
Aceclofenac
Aceclofenac may decrease the excretion rate of Chloral hydrate which could result in a higher serum level.
Acemetacin
Acemetacin may decrease the excretion rate of Chloral hydrate which could result in a higher serum level.
Acenocoumarol
The protein binding of Acenocoumarol can be decreased when combined with Chloral hydrate.

### Food Interactions

Avoid alcohol. Ingesting alcohol may cause a disulfiram-like-reaction (flushing, dizziness, tachycardia).
Take after a meal. If chloral hydrate is being used for sedation, it should be taken after meals. Otherwise, it can be taken with or without food.
