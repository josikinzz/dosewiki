## Subjective Experience

3-FPM is an analogue of phenmetrazine, which was allegedly used by The Beatles in
Hamburg as a functional aid, to enable them to perform for excessively long hours.
Whilst phenmetrazine disappeared from the market over time, 3-FPM emerged late
in 2014, sold via online vendors and sourced, presumably, from Chinese labs. It
gained a reasonable amount of traction over a relatively short period of time.

I sampled it on a number of occasions, writing on forums over several months. My
contributions amounted to the following (edited for continuity):

```
Well, that was a nice little experience. I consumed this orally as a series of
50mg doses, to test the water. This produced a mild buzz, confirming other
observations what we are probably talking 100mg+ for the full effect, at least
via this RoA.
```

And:

```
I insufflated over the course of the evening. The intensity gradually increased
to produce an extremely nice ride, although I was still generally functional if I
needed to be.
```
```
Interestingly, whilst not pleasant, I didn't find insufflation to be so terrible.
Certainly, my last snorting exercise, with kanna, was much more problematic.
This lack of discomfort could have been mitigated by the fact that I had
consumed a small amount orally beforehand, but I was expecting far worse.
```
```
Less positive news came with residue stim. I was awake until around 1am, at
which point I popped 1mg of Etizolam. This did the trick, and I slept like a
baby.
```
The upshot of what I now consider to be reckless dosing was that this provided a
fairly pleasant experience. However, my final post described another side to the coin:

```
The thread on this substance is extraordinary. I was one of the early jumpers
and was as enthusiastic as anyone. It seemed to be nice and clean, and was
certainly the source of an enjoyable buzz. However, it soon became obvious
that there was a ceiling, and that I was consuming increasing amounts to get
beyond it.
```
```
This was a red light for me, so I stopped after a few sessions.
```
```
I had cold and flu-like symptoms over Christmas, but although I suspect it was
implicated, I can't pin it on this chemical with any certainty. What I definitely
experienced was increasing body load, and lower returns in terms of reward.
This got to the point where the positive effects were simply not worth the
aftermath.
```
```
The reports of illness and other reactions are alarming. It really is so easy to
fall into the redosing trap with this one, even for experienced researchers who
should know better.
```
```
Take it easy.
```
During the following months claims emerged that 3-FPM was the cause of
inflammation and that it had detrimental effects upon the immune system. Certainly,
it seemed to linger in the body longer than most.

I never returned to this following these early tests. Functionally, there were better
options available, and recreationally I felt no inclination to take undue risks.

Notwithstanding the above, at one point this was one of the most popular legal
stimulants on the market.
