2-Naphthylmethcathinone (BMAPN), also known as βk-methamnetamine, is a stimulant drug of the cathinone and naphthylaminopropane families. It inhibits dopamine reuptake and has rewarding and reinforcing properties in animal studies. It is banned under drug analogue legislation in a number of jurisdictions. The drug was at one point marketed under the name NRG-3, although only a minority of samples of substances sold under this name have been found to actually contain BMAPN, with most such samples containing mixtures of other cathinone derivatives.
