For obvious reasons, this one needs to be treated with the utmost caution. It's certainly far from the ideal candidate for the RC market.

**The Small & Handy 3-HO-PCP Thread**


I searched and could find no reference to this one on BL.


Anybody with experience using 3-HO-PCP / 3-OH-PCP (using both terms just for sake of future indexing by TFSE.


Damn uncommon stuff from what I can tell, got myself a small sample on the way with a few other arylcyclohexylamines I was planning on exploring some more, not much, only 10mg. And that I have had to search, and search, and search for. 


From what I know of it, doses are comparable with phencyclidine itself, although I have never tried PCP itself, it is pretty much unavailable here, not for want of looking for it, never found any though ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)

I used a small sample of it at 7 mg IM (staggered dose) a few years ago that I happened across by sheer luck. For me it was the most opiate-like of all the dissociatives I've tried. Strangely, two other bluelighters reported dysphoric effects with it, and experienced effects at a far lower dosage than me (I think around 3 mg IM). They thought it a dud. I very much disagreed, as I thought it very warm. Adder has a brief description in Trip Reports but I don't remember what he concludes. 


It's weird how various the responses are at the experimental stage of these exotic dissociatives (I'm recalling 3-MeO-PCP). I'd think you'd get two solid experiences out of your 10 mg IV, though it's hard to say when cross-tolerance is a very real factor. Stagger your doses. I think the degree of tolerance probably variably changes the quality of the high, too (in my case mild cross-tolerance from MXE improved 3-MeO-PCP relative to no tolerance when I first tried it, or at least seemed to.) Be cautious with 3-ho, though. It's both a temptress and potentially dangerous because of the mu agonism. Mixing with opiates strikes me as risky but admittedly also probably really enjoyable, heh (ain't that a bitch?). With your tolerance to both classes of drugs you're probably less of a risk than a newcomer, though. You're on a slippery path, but I can tell you know it, so I'll just say "good luck."

I don't have any real current tolerance to dissociatives, its been quite a while since I used any, aside from a couple of IV doses of n-ethylnorketamine and both 3- and 4-methoxyphencyclidine a couple of weeks ago.


As for opiate effects, could you make comparisons with any 'normal' opioids, in terms of potency? I'm not really too concerned about the potential for an opioid overdose, not with having such a small sample, and opioid tolerance, unfortunately that I do have.


I think I might just try a very slow IV push at 5mg, on its own. The day after though, I get my opiate rx (oxycontin), thats just going to be too tempting to leave lying around :D

LC- for what it is worth the jury is still out as to whether 3-OH PCP is an agonist or an antagonist at the MOR. At least that is how I, and some others, review the current scant literature on the subject. Figured that might be pertinent to you as you are on pain management. Or at least toady is ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png) 


But please do report back. I have never tried this one, but as Psood mentions there was quite a bit of variation in how the trusted  dudes responded to such. . . .

After the recent disappointment of the (likely) fake 3-HO-PCE that circulated the market, I'm left with a nagging curiosity about the 3-hydroxy ACHs.


I'll be interested to hear the results, as well.

It is DEFINITELY not an antagonist. Or if it is, it is a very, very VERY weak one. I would have known about it had I taken an opioid antagonist, in a most unpleasant way.


I enjoyed it, ended up doing all 10mg in two intravenous doses, and combining it later with both some 2-MeO-deschloroketamine and 4-MeO-PCP after  these had mostly worn off. Definitely felt a rush, something more than some of the other arylcyclohexylamines I've tried.


Without going into pricing discussion, it was bloody extortionate though :/

Might well work out  better to try and go and prepare it from the= corresponding methyl ether.

**3-ho-pcp**


There's only a small amount of scattered information on the internet about 3-HO-PCP (I'm not sure if/what external references I'm permitted to link to).


It's mentioned in a few threads on Bluelight. The first being Adders excellent [PCP analogs (Cumulative)](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/623701-3-ho-pcp) thread.


> 3'-HO-PCP

> Report:

I leave it marked because its analogs may be serious opioid agonists. Officially, 3’-HO-PCP is like 10% of morphine. The only problem with this compound is that it’s 8 times as potent as PCP at PCP receptor so opioid activity (although it’s hundreds much more pronounced than with PCP) is little when compared. Yet I love this one.

There's another I won't link to, because it seems to be a little confused with 3-MEO-PCP.


Does anyone have any experience, knowledge, or educated speculation about this chemical?

I don't think the potential dysphoria is that weird or strange like ps00donym says, if 3-HO-PCP binds to the MOR as strongly as was already predicted by SAR... strong agonism can turn into antagonism as counterintuitive as that may sound. I am often still confused by this as well because I am definitely not an expert on this and forget about this stuff all the time.


Naturally, endorphins bind to the MORs with certain efficacy. Artificial agonists also activate the receptors, if partial agonists they do not do it as well as the natural endorphins but considering they are 'additional' to the system the total quantity of opioids present is increased so the total effect is positive.

If full agonists, they do it just as well as the natural endorphins. That happens when they fit especially well in the receptor. So far so good.


But here's the thing: a compound can bind 'too well' to the receptor, to the extent that it occupies the receptor without actually continuing to produce further activation. So now even the endorphins are blocked, and the net effect is negative.


It is even possible for a compound to bind permanently to the receptor (irreversible antagonist), that would in many cases be very problematic.


Also, some compounds are selective receptor modulators - they give different effects in different tissues so they are sometimes an agonist (I bet typically a full agonist), sometimes an antagonist. Not sure if that happens only in special circumstances or if that indicates that the binding is exactly in-between that of an agonist and antagonist and the exact receptor morphology decides which.


So I guess if 3-HO-PCP is somewhere along the lines of full agonist, or mixed agonist it would explain the dysphoria?


I have no idea why then it is less potent than fentanyl type drugs though, maybe the reason for that lies with the difference between affinity and efficacy.


Sorry to make this ADDy! And if I am wrong about stuff please correct me.


(And in any case... theoretically 3-HO-PCP is a bit too much for me, i.e. too potent / scary pharmacologically)

Mmmm, I just stumbled across this thread and think I should share my experiences. I received something labelled as 3-HO-PCP in mid 2006. I had a massive PCP tolerance back then (100-200mg/d) which might be the reason why I did not feel any sort of dissociation after ingesting the stuff. I did however get a very violent muscle clonus! I first only noticed an increase in muscle tension, but when I started wanking the clonus appeared in my legs which was quite unsettling.


Back then I figured I must've received the wrong chemical (got it for free from an online friend who experienced muscle tension as well), but reading this thread now I'm starting to believe it might've been 3-HO-PCP after all. I'd say skip this one...

Yar.....as Hugo alluded to, as did I, it is not known *how* exactly this functions at the MOR......I only tried it a few times at small doses a few years ago and I have a permanent ridiculous dissociative tolerance.....didn't do much for me, other than feel kinda toxic and icky....there are much more interesting variations out there! Adders report on this is yet again distinctly different from everyone else's experiences and adds to the SAR speculation BS rather than actual trials....as to why, I dunno....

About 2-3x as potent as regular PCP and has a tendancy to cause violent muscle spasms as mentioned above. Also retains opiate activity at about 10% of morphine from what I've read so I'd call this one a withdrawal-inducer without any use because I used to be addicted to opiates for so long. If not, maybe it's something for you to try, but remember this may cause physical dependancy if used regularly.


I would personally not put any PCP analogue in me that retains opiate activity. Problem with these drugs long half life and them getting reabsorbed due to their lipid solubilty just makes for really shitty withdrawals if it is a MOR agonist.

Yeah I actually had that in my post. My friend's and my experiences with 3-HO-PCP make adder's thread seem like a product of fiction. I removed that line out of respect though, there could be other reasons for the discrepancy (e.g. him confusing the chemical when writing the report).


And for those interested in the extremely surreal experience PCP supplies who cannot get ahold of it, diphenidine comes very close (it's actually a lot crazier than pcp) and is currently legal in every country afaik.

And the PCE analogue (it says here).  Supposed MOR activity,

3x potency of PCP, muscle spasms, sounds like a mixed bag for sure, two out of three ain't bad?

Any news? How dangerous is a 1-3mg insufflated dose ? I'm not after opioid activity, but since 3-Ho-PCE also did not give me opioid effects, I hope that this compound also does not. Not appreciating to be the first guinea pig (after years), unless the test is about an amph-analogue of course. ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

I will try that one pretty soon ... I was looking for a 3-Meo-PCP alternative, but seem to have found it in 3-HO-PCE, which is a (seemingly) milder, longer lasting 3-Meo-PCP for me.

Yeah that might be the one I had. Leg spasms so violent I was surprised my furniture survived. No dissociative activity. Actually I think it may have been labelled as 3-HO-PCP, but was 2-PCP, I don't exactly remember. Didn't elicit the slightest dissociative activity.

I've taken small doses, 5mg, and then 2mg on. It's not so bad. Just came in today. Nice stoning effect, some visuals prominent with vaped weed. Feels nice for a disso. Doses were oral. 


still going through the experience, but I initially dosed about 4  hours ago. And it's rather warm too. Been using kratom as well, because I'm in chronic pain so I use it with everything. I also feel like I'm paying a  bit more attention to my heart, had an experience where I tried to combine small doses of 2-xo-pce and 2-oxo-pcm (like 6mg of one and 11mg of the other) where my heart was bating fast. But I ended upfine. No such trouble here so far in that aspect.


Don't expect me to write a TR. haha.

Allergy test (insufflation of <1mg) did not provide muscle spasms.


What are the estimated specs of this compound (the real deal) :


- duration

- half-life

- dose range


Anyone ?

Okay, this one seems to be a pretty potent dissociative stimulant :


4mg at t+0 and 2mg insufflated at t+5h provided a similar experience like a low dose 3-Meo-PCP. But it is even more potent I'd say. Cannot comment on the opioid activity. No muscle spasms until now (t+9h).


Just saying that it seems to be very potent and a pretty strong stimulant, but does not provide a typical dissociative experience like the recent substituted PCE(M)s and  and it is even colder than 3-Meo-PCP. 


Perceived Half-Life (actual should be alot longer) of a low (I would say low at least) dose seems to be like 4 or 5h like the above poster mentioned.


Further tests are due.

Two test runs so far, ~19mg and ~30mg, respectively, both insufflated, a few days apart. Yea, I got a decent tolerance but I also jumped into it pretty deep cause I only got 100mg. Highly advise against trying to follow my lead unless you're experience.


19mg insufflated gave a nice feeling of warm dissociation with a clearer head than 3-MeO-PCP and slightly reminiscent of MXE, but definitely not as much as the MXE fiends would like. Didn't find it at all stimulating. Came down from the peak in two and half hours, fully down in like four and half - six hours.


30mg insufflated... fuckin stoned and the most intense numbing I've had of any disso in a long time, not since I would do a few hundred mg's of MXE in a night. Strong confusion at times, obivously lol, but manageable for my partner and I. Foot rub was otherworldy. Hole/blackout for probably twenty-ish minutes. Easily lost in music. Took 1mg Etizolam at the three hour mark and crashed for the night, woke up still a little wonky and goofy six hours later(would've slept more but work).


I like this a lot more than 3-MeO-PCP, I can't quite put my finger on it but it's got something over it's methoxy brother.

At low doses it is certainly stimulating enough for a stim fan like me without many side effects, also without much confusion (a little has to be expected from a disso).

This feels actually really close to 3-Meo-PCP. It is only stimulating the first 90min with a 5mg insufflated dose, afterwards (or earlier) it is very 3-Meo-like. The floating feeling when walking/biking, while otherwise having no signs of motor-impairment I only knew from 3-Meo-PCP is also present here.


The appearance of the substance sucks a bit (in my case). Big crystal rocks, and the drip reminds me very much of DPT.

Have to watch out ... this is very potent and the comeup takes ~60-90 min, even insufflated. So if you plan to function after intake, measure the dose (stay below ~6mg if you dont have a huge tolerance).


Also the duration is pretty long after taking a full dose (I guess ~8mg insufflated). Like 9h light dissociation and floating feeling. The stimulation levels off after the come-up by the way. So it cannot really abused as a stim, only in very low dosages unfortunately. :D Very similar to 3-Meo-PCP overall.

Never say never. ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif) If I had a day or two off and 100mg DPT Hcl available and cannot be disturbed I would probably snort it in two bumps. Then again, maybe I would be wiser, freebase it and try to vape it instead. Because the come-up is also very ugly on insufflated DPT compared to vaped/smoked. /endofftopic

I disagree. Full effects weren't present until t+60min. Until then it felt like a light stim after that like a typical PCP-like disso, which was pretty inconvenient in my setting to say the least. ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif) Could of course be caused by myself not crushing the crystals enough before insufflation.


And we have to define, what is a higher dose. I consider my disso tolerance to be moderately high at the moment unfortunately. Anyway I could get pretty whacked from 8mg insufflated 3-HO-PCP. So start low @anyone who was not abusing the shit out of dissos the last months.

Yes I actually had a semi-bad experience when I snorted it and went hiking in the woods back when I first insufflated DPT in form of the HCl salt in 2004. I was already relatively experienced then - I'd say I had a bit less than 50 psychedelic experiences prior to DPT of which only one was bad (very very bad).


So yeah, the comeup was rough. However when I vaped the freebase at up t 120mg (if memory serves right) it was pure beauty. Same goes for combinations with MDMA and ketamine, a very pleasant experiences. While there is a lot of truth in that saying, I will still stick to my claim: I'm never ever gonna snort that shit again! ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

This one is a pretty awesome substance (body load and euphoria wise), but a little bit too potent for my taste. It is very easy to overdose this stuff, so a scale is must IMHO. I rather like to insufflate less potent dissos like 3-Meo-PCE, which I up to now never overdosed, nor lost control on. Again 3-HO-PCP is very awesome, but very potent, dunno, if thats helpful. (Never tried to hole on it). Plus I find it VERY similar to 3-Meo-PCP, but the last time I tried that one was ~1 1/2 years ago.

And a short trip report mostly a copy and paste from reddit so:


> fast come up


> not caustic


> quite disgusting taste


> potency is in the ballpark of 3-meo-pcp, but the duration is shorter


> while the effects are quite similar there are some important differences


> both are manic with the whole 'I'm the man state of mind'


> 3-ho-pcp is less stimulating, it does keep you awake but there's no urge to move around


> doesn't hit motor control or cognitive ability as hard


> both are good anxiolytics, pain killers, antidepressants


> unlike 3-meo-pcp this one is very fast, quick come up, steady peak, and a sudden droop of to almost sober


> extremely short residual stimulation, you can sleep after an hour or so without benzos


> I got some cevs which is weird since dissos don't give me that on most occasions


> no hangover


Tl;dr it's still expensive vs 3-meo-pcp but imo much more worth the money vs 3-ho-pce.


Doses were snorted and around ~ 30 mg over the course of an evening.

The new batch comes as fine granular powder and still has the DPTesque drip. Best of both worlds I'd say. %)


For me it is not that stimulating today (but this could be attributed to the fact that I was abusing stims the last 2 days), but it is very potent (!) and fun. 


It has certainly more fuck up potential than every other currently popular disso despite 3-meo-PCP (which is very similar anyway IMHO). Ok, you would not loose a day or two to amnesia like on 2-oxo-PCE, but you can do more than just laying around on a too high dose, which is the dangerous (or for some of them the fun) part.

I have to add, that this compound is more prone to produce unwanted physical side effects in my case (feverish feelings, abdominal phantom(?) pain) than the more popular 2-oxo-PCE and 3-meo-PCE. I forgot about the side effects of 3-meo-PCP because it is too long ago.


It is more serious and the mindfuckery is crazier (than the mentioned substituted PCEs). The first batch (big rocks, hardly insufflatable) did not produce those side effects. Or it is just coincidence. Dunno.


I'll lay off the experiments with 3-Ho-PCP for a while.

Hi Bigazznugz,


no I never tried the good old Angel Dust, around here only Ketamine is common of the dissos. PCP is totally rare. So I cannot comment on subjective perceptive similarities with that one. ![:|](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eyesclosed.gif)


One thing I can add regarding 3-HO-PCP is, that the experience itself is not that recreational but it has the best anti-depressive after effects of all the dissos I've tried, lasting about 20-40h after a dose (depending on the dose of course). The experience itself is rather not so recreational, if you get above the low dose threshold on which it only operates as a stimulant (let's say <5 mg insufflated).

Surprised there haven't been more reports of this yet.  I generally am not one to write trip reports, but I have 100mg on its way and I'll try to at least write out my thoughts on it.

Tested this recently after overcoming suspicion towards the opioid affinity.


It's definitely more dopey than I expect from a dissociative, though apart from that it seems a pretty decent one, and is conducive to artistic performance. More suprisingly, "dumb MXE" (as I nickname it) easily seems to keep me going beyond 24h. And normally you kinda feel you're redlining it with things like stimulants, but not with this one. Nope, like having slept.


In the end it gave me wacky heartbeat. Maybe related to the unintended redlining? It's been disturbing enough not to repeat experiments, at least until I can approach it with another style of use in mind. Because apparently using it like a normal dissociative gets me into cardiac trouble.

Couple mg here and there seems to be the way to go with this one. Lucid as 3-MeO-PCP, warm as 3-MeO-PCE - definitely have to watch the dose though.

Is it confirmed (paper?), that this one has more kappa-opioid-receptor affinity than related compounds (3-Meo-PCP) ? Subjectively this one caused way more nausea/stoning body load at low doses (2-4mg) than 3-Meo-PCP.Also the half-life seems to be incredibly long.

3hoPCP is my new fav dissociative. Warm, euphoric and somewhat energetic dissociation. Uplifting afterglow. Imo it's even better than O-pce.

I found it to be quite different then o-pce or dck. It?s closer in effects to 3 meo pcp/pce.

I have only tried 5mg split in two doses an hour apart. At that dose it?s very clear headed and relaxing. So relaxing in fact that when it started to kick in I fell asleep for 3 hours then woke up with a very mild dissociative high thats comparable to a similar dosage of 3 meo pcp. 

I will be trying 5mg all at once next time and 8mg after that.

Last night I tried 8 mg snorted. I found it very mild and decided to take another 8mg an hour later. The effects got slightly stronger but not drastically so. 

This still reminds me of 3 meo pcp without an edge. A very clear headed dissociative. 


I should add that I?ve been binging on 3 meo pcp for the past 1.5 months, low doses nearly every day. I did not have any for 2 days prior to this experience. I?m sure that affected my tolerance so don?t take my dosage advice and start low and work your way up slowly etc.


Next time I?ll try 12-15 at once. 

To be completely honest I was hoping for more from this chemical based on the few glowing reports. Maybe after a tolerance break it will be deeper and more fun.


I do feel a nice after glow today so it wasn?t for naught

I agree with this. I've tried this chemical two times this weekend and was really looking forward to it because of some of the reports i've read here and on reddit. But it didnt produce a very distinct effect or feeling.


I followed the dosage range from the psychonautwiki (4-6 mg) and the effects were very smooth. The experience was warm and easy going. But no profound effects. Not much of a headspace like you said. In my experience most similar to 3-meo-pce.


I'm certainly not dissapointed by this chemical, but it seems to me i'll have to try and up the dosage to see what kind of effects that'll bring me.

is it truly like 3-meo-pce? my partner and i favor 3-meo-pce over most other dissos, so a cheaper, more potent ach with similar effects would be ideal. fwiw, we both find 3-meo-pce very rewarding at the right dosage level, and love that there isnt the floopy nature of dck/ opce, which can each be rather debilitating during the loooooooong comedown. i guess i should add that we dont have a significant tolerance like VERY heavy daily users, and we like 3-meo-pce at the 30mg level... at that level with opce, (20-25mg), we are dumber than a wetted up pile of bricks after two hours or so (after the hole)... i prefer being able to do things. like think.

I havenb't tried either, but from what I recall reading, most people don't like 3-HO-PCE much but do like 3-HO-PCP.  I could be mis-remembering though.

I didn't have 3-meo-pce in a long time, but in those lower doses I mentioned it felt almost the same as 3-meo-pce, with a little more of a body heavy feeling. If you like 3-meo-pce I think you should give this a try at least and see what it does for you.


Anyway I've since then upped my doses (10-20mg orally) to see effect changes, but it didn't do much more for me. It 

I should note my tolerance skyrocketed since I also started IM'ing o-pce in the 25-30mg range.


The last time I tried 3-ho-pcp was 20mg IM and don't remember anything from it.. There  also was no real hole to it or CEV's (like with ketamine, mxe or o-pce).


I don't think I'll be trying this chemical more because with my tolerance low doses don't do anything special for me and the effects I get from it, are not those I'm searching for in a disso. So I rather stick to o-pce or just good old ketamine.

I really like this stuff, I think it's better than 3-MeO-PCP.  I will write a report sometime.  The combo of propylhexedrine, one bump of 3-MeO-PCP, a bit of 4-FA and 3-HO-PCP is one of the nicest drug places I've ever been.

Hi folks! Been a long time since I don`t post, but after my recent experiments with novel dissociatives, I felt compelled to share.


I Had 2 good experiences with 3-HO-PCP so far, with initial doses of approximately 10mg and a few redoses until a total of 30mg max (oral). As I always do with 3-meo-pcp, I dissolved 100mg in 2ml of gyn and dosed using a dropper vial, so each drop should have 2.5mg. On the second time, I already had 50mg of 3-meo-pce in the vial, so for each 10mg of 3-HO-PCP, there was 5mg of 3-meo-pce on the mix.


I must add that my last experiences with 3-meo-pce didn`t give me real effects until about 20-25mg was consumed (also orally), so I don`t know to what degree it influenced this trip. The mix seemed more potent, as 4 drops were enough to achieve a really nice state, while pure 3-HO-PCP seems to be more noticeable at about 15mg. However both experiences weren`t much subjectively different.


Both times I took it, I was in a party environment. Dancing was really enjoyable (I felt like a dancing machine actually) and socialising was more easy than normal - I interacted with various random ppl and made a few friends. Alcohol was also consumed.

It`s stimulant and, at the same time, produces a "zen" state of mind. However, the body feeling of relaxation is stronger. Laying down with my eyes closed was very pleasurable and I could reach states of loss of notion over my body limits. In this sense it kinda reminded me of Ketamine. It also induced a few deep conversations, my reasoning was sharp and there was a strong feeling of oneness. Social barriers were more fluid and the feeling of empathy came quite easily. I had sex at the tail end of the second trip and, as with 3-meo-pcp, it definitely isn`t aphrodisiac, but also didn`t make it impossible to have an erection.


I should note that 3 drops of the mixture one the day after my second experiment gave almost no effects, only a slight dissociation/stimulation that kept me from sleeping. There is probably some tolerance. 


In the last year I went through 1g of 3-meo-pcp, 4 or 5g of Ketamine and 3 or 4g MXE, so that`s my referential, but before that I didn`t have much experience with this kind of drugs. Overall I think in low-medium doses of dissociatives are great social lubricants and better tools than MDMA to deeply and truly connect people, so I frequently use them in social events. I actually see them as quite carnivalesque drugs, if you know what I mean... maybe with the exception of ketamine which surely I prefer to consume while lying down on my bed hahahah!


Back to 3-HO-PCP: so far I see it as a very versatile drug in the sense  it has the potential to induce states of deep introspection, but it also enables social interaction and isn`t more motor impairing than low doses of MXE. I guess Zen is a good word to describe the dissociative effects of this drug, as it serves as a good tool to intensely live the moment, free of redundant internal chatter.


It`s a little bit early to say it`s my favorite dissociative, but these two experiences certainly gave it a special place in my heart. I am yet to decide if I will mix 3-HO-PCP or MXE with ALD-52 at the Radiohead concert I am to attend in a few months.

It sounds like a total winner. I would love a comparison going into detail of 3-meo-pcp vs 3-ho-pcp and the same comparison with MXE.

Yeah I like 3-HO-PCP a lot, more than 3-MeO-PCP so far (but I think I'd still prefer 3-MeO-PCP for going to shows and stuff, I've never been psychotic though).  The state 3-HO-PCP produces is much calmer and more centering, and I've had some pretty intense perceptual changes too and a sort of almost psychedelic thought space.

Well, I have lurked here for ages. Had this account since way back but never contributed really. Thought it was time to contribute some so here we go, an account of 3-ho-PCP with a dash of a tryptamine. I wrote this for erowid but Im not sure if/when it will be published and since 3-ho-PCP is floating around at the moment it might be a good idea to have this published ASAP. 


:::


Late Friday night after emerging from a full day of studying I decided to go on a psychedelic foray to process the concepts I had studied. I have found that certain types of psychedelic dissociatives, fully immersive doses of ketamine etc,  help me integrate and better understand some abstract concepts. Further I have found that augmenting the dissociative with a tryptamine enhances this visualization a great deal. Also, I find it hilarious! 


Worth noting is that I have a rather extensive prior experience with altered states. I am fit and in good health, I do not take any medications. I am very familiar with 4-Aco-DMT and I have been over the course of 3 months intermittently titrating up the dose of this particular batch of 3-ho-PCP. I have to stress that the dose of 3-ho-PCP I took could be considered a VERY high dose (definitely NOT a starting dose) and one should approach this novel and incredibly potent compound with utmost respect because it can cause damage (accidents under the influence or as a direct result of ingesting an untested substance). 


T 00:00 - I carefully measured out **20mg of 3-ho-PCP** and **10mg of 4-Aco-DMT** and **insulfated** the combined powders. I prepared a playlist of soft ambient tracks and proceeded to bed. 


T 00:10  - FIrst alerts, slight dissociation. A visual lag, as is if the speed of visual processing has dropped.  A slight numb feeling in the nose, that is spreading across my entire body. 


T 00:30 - Rapid onset is a bit unsettling. I am anxious, is my heart racing? Can not differentiate between my heartbeat and the texture of the wood in the ceiling. Come to the conclusion that its not worth trying so I lean back and close my eyes. 


T 00:50 - The effects are developing rapidly. The 4-aco-DMT lends a softness, enhanced texture and squiggly colour to the otherwise clinical and a bit cubistic experience of the 3-ho-PCP. The falling and rising tones of the ambient music creates a space in my minds eye. I am being dislodged from my body and drifting along ridges of phosphorescent green/purple interference at hyperspeed. 


T 01:00 - My girlfriend come is to the bedroom and gets ready to go to bed. We have some interesting conversations. I ask her if robots can make art? If they have the right to reproduce? As we kiss goodnight and she falls asleep I ponder her answers. There is a rapid stream of realizations and insights. 


T 02:00 - I ponder AI. I have the experience of projecting myself into the "shoes" of an artificial consciousness with all the sensors and search inputs of the connected internets at its disposal. I feel godlike. There is a lot of noise and cognitive static in the form nonsensical sentences that to me, at that time, is imbued with great significance: "Cosmos, the gates are left unhinged", "Eyes, life's way to have a looksie at itself" etc. 


T 03:00 - I start to feel a lessening of effects and for a while I believe I am mostly down. I get up to pee, feel a bit woobly as the motor function is still rather impaired. By the time I get down the stairs and into the bathroom and turn on the lights it becomes evident to me that I am no way near baseline. The proportions of the room and the colors and textures of the objects in it is severely distorted. The white porcelain toilet has taken on the shape of a bright yellow, bloating rubber toros (donut) and I am trying to aim my laser beam of phosphorescent blue urine into it. Amusing. I look at my hand and it feels like my leg so I decide I better go back to bed as I can probably not safely navigate the house unsupervised in this state. 


T 03:30 - Back in bed with the earphones on I am floating in a space, I am an oort cloud (a region of space composed of comet-like bodies and other minor planets and asteroids that orbit distantly in planetary systems) and I vividly envision the mass-energy equivalence. A clear image of how the reduction of the speed of light squared under energi give rise to matter. I am all these variables and the relation between them feels as obvious to me as the relation between my left and right hand at a baseline state of mind. Extraordinary! I am mind blown and grateful to exist in such a beautiful system. 


T 04:00 - Content with the day I drift out of consciousness and into sleep. 


T 12:00 - I awake, feeling good but notice some residual dissociation. This slight motor control deficiency is experienced with my previous trials and usually dissipates within a half a day or so with the aid of some coffee, food and fresh air. The inner incessant dialogue is gone, I feel peaceful and content just being, a pleasant side-effect.   


It was a beautiful experience. 3-ho-PCP has some long legs and its better to clear the schedule for the next day and make sure not to operate heavy machinery. It is noted that although you might believe that you are at baseline, you might not be. This effect could be deceiving and is more likely to present itself if you do not space out your doses enough (Its not gospel, just a suspicion). I have been spacing my doses two weeks apart while trailing 3-ho-PCP, yet I have a nagging suspicion my baseline is off somehow.  Now that I have found what is my upper dose limit I will refrain from using this material any time soon. Both to ensure that tolerance wont build up but also because I believe it holds a real potential to be strongly habit forming, if only psychologically. 


Stay safe, start low.

I had a beautiful experience on the combo of propylhexedrine, 3-MeO-PCP and 3-HO-PCP (heavier on the 3-HO than the 3-MeO) last night.  I was with my girlfriend and we were working on painting my office and then decorating it with my art.  I found a bunch of art that I almost forgot about but that was very important to me.  It was so profound for me rediscovering them.  I felt so overwhelmingly inspired and full of love, and everything I thought about made me think deeply.  Such a wonderful, beautiful state.  3-HO-PCP is a special one.  When combined with a bit of 3-MeO it's even better, but just a bit of 3-MeO or else it becomes more manic/egoic like 3-MeO.  3-HO-PCP is more centered and loving. 

 It can be quite psychedelic in its own way too, in the thought process.  A few times now I've been to a truly special state of perfection with this drug and some adjuncts and whenever I've gotten there it's like the floodgates open and my mind is working on all cylinders and I feel so intensely inspired and content and happy and capable.

Indeed. That state of mind feels so effortlessly beautiful. Its highly seductive and better used sparsely, at least that is how I approach it, or I know I will end up a manic mechanic with a shit storm to clean up at the tail end of things...

Anyone else have the brown Sandy batch? It's got to be impure because it's not as potent as this chem should be. But I've still been having a great time with it snorting 20mg.

"3-ho-pcp", do we already have a nickname for this compound? I suggest "HCP", it is an awesome substance. 

I received the white sandy batch, you can hear the little particles crush under a razor blade - similar to ketamine, but not as big. 

I've had no issues creating a 2mg/ml solution using distilled water and I can't report a degraded potency. My "HCP" is stored in a amber bottle in case it matters. 


I've primarily used the liquid solution to ingest a relatively low amount of 2.5 mg for prolonged periods of time (I think about 5 days a week for 4 weeks straight EDIT: not recommended). 

I found it to be an awesome suppressor (or opponent) of depression and (negative) thoughts. I'ts almost like I am in a meditating state of mind; clear headed and 

precisely thinking to say it, using other words. Anxiety vanished. It also makes me hella confident and the good vibes seem to transfer to other people as well.


Back then I was working in the telecommunication business and I found the talks to be really easy going and 

flowing without to much effort. I was part of a workshop and performed godly if I may say so, creative ideas where sprinkling all around in my head, putting them into words or written language

was the biggest barrier lol. Long story short, HCP made me realize the job I was working as is a horrible and demonic construct. I no longer work for the callcenter agency. I felt like being

(ab)used by them, they suck out all your positivity into the talks which generate them money. It's all about the money, I mean I sold pretty good products, but it still felt to manipulating to me.


This might sound like I off tracked from my initial topic, but apparently what I wanted to say is that it is really therapeutic and reflecting. I worked for 8 months in this business and HCP made

me reevaluate my decisions and say "fuck it, im out"... !!!You don't need to dose daily to achive such effects, you just need to wanna work at it)!!!


On retrospect I'd probably advise a lower amount than 2.5mg daily, I definitely felt altered on this amount, which may or may not be desired. It also felt really mentally taxing, I realized a lot of 

fucked up decisions/paths that I took that I now work at (sober). 


I didn't feel a withdrawal, which is odd when assuming it has opioid properties. Dosing twice a day (2.5mg) didn't achive any greater results. I didn't even notice when the HCP stopped working,

the day just continued being great... 


---


I already noticed that there is a notable difference when comparing nasal to oral HCP, but I would really appreciate some input on this topic. I think nasally its more sedating (only tried it 3 times nasally iirc)


I've had a unbelievably spiritual experience on o-pce + HCP, both orally. I've never been in greater hole... I feel like o-pce and HCP combined, are a match made in heaven. 


---


Currently I am gladly abstaining from the daily dosing regime and trying to find the best blend between o-pce and HCP

to my current understanding HCP won't lead you down the hole when used as a single compound. 


I will keep the dosing to once every 2 weeks, which I think is needed to get the most out of it. 


Will update you guys once I started mixing K with HCP, which in theory sounds awesome as hell...

Can it be, that this compound degrades pretty fast ? Took a few eyeballed mini-doses (1-2mg) insufflated and orally and frankly did not feel much at all. Has been stored in a dark, dry space for several months.


I'm beginning to realize that this compound may not be for me, as I highly prefer 3-MeO-PCP and 3-MeO-PCE.


Next trial will be with measured dose. (Usually I titrate low eyeballed doses with every disso over the course of a day after the first successfull trials with measured doses).

Don't like this one much orally. At ~7mg it makes me drowsy for 6 hours, then hypermanic/hyperactive for 12 hours with a hypermanic afterglow for the next day.


Neither functional, nor recreational for me. Just a different, non-insightful (even subjectively) state from sobriety. Maybe I need to learn the compound. Oral ROA is not for me with dissos (too long duration).

Haven't been here quite a while since that experience. I made a decision after that to have a tolerance break for 3 months.


Anyway what I meant to say there was 2 things, but I phrased it badly.

First off I was just stating my last experience with 3-ho-pcp. And secondly what I meant to say was that with other high doses(that I remember!), there were no noteworthy effects.


Catching back up on this thread and after my tolerance break, I'm really eager to give this another shot!

Posted a full report in the TR section... Overall I found it to be very intense and not functional in the least, the sort of dissociative experience where I am drowning in the waves beneath a turbulent sea.... I found it very very comparable to my experiences with combining 3-MeO-PCE and 3-MeO-PCP. Would anyone else who has done that combo before be able to offer any insight?

Overall I prefer 3-HO-PCE over 3-HO-PCP. The former is more subtle and more functional. The latter is to unpredictable and too long-lasting (and perhaps too potent for my taste). 3-MeO-PCP is the best functional disso and 3-MeO-PCE is the most recreational one. Hands down. 2-Oxo-PCE is the most easy to hole on. 3-HO-PCXs are just odd (and the opioid side effects are fucking annoying, at least for me) ...

This stuff had a weird hangover, kind of sore muscle-like, even though I didn't feel it at all during the experience. I woke up feeling OK, but it really kicked in toward afternoon, lasting 6 hours. I wonder these days if you can even trust what it is. Chinese, "reliable" established vendor, White very fine powder. No real anti-depressant effect nexr day. Because of strange next day hangover, my opinion is to not try it. I had high hopes. Not really like 3-meo-pcp. That is much better. My 2c.

I had some really great experiences with 3-HO-PCP and some lackluster.  I went through about 400mg.  Early on I combined equal parts 3-MeO-PCP and 3-HO-PCP and had some really incredible experiences, but I'm still not quite sure what to make of this stuff overall.  I'd say I prefer 3-MeO-PCP but they're quite different.

I had only lackluster experiences with this. Always felt slightly poisoned, as if I had a minor fever. Felt like a combo of 2-Oxo-PCE and too many beers on a hot summer day for the most part. The best attribute of the experience is, that it has a significant anti-depressing after effect for 48h without causing annoying manic episodes. So the aim should be to dose as low as possible in my opinion.

Wish I could say it had an after-effect antidepressant effect, but not for me.

Hmm, what was your dose like ? I remember I dosed lower than I would dose 3-MeO-PCE or 2-Oxo-PCE (also never redosed, because it is that potent and long-lasting overall), i.e. usually not significantly more than ~5mg insufflated. Even then the effects were quite pronounced after the eternal come-up (~90-120min). Did seldomly like the effects, but it had the best immediate after-effects of any disso I tried. Unfortunately after the antidepressent period, which starts ~16h after intake and lasts ~48h, there is a period of muscle-tension/joint pain, which lasts another 48h. To sum it up, for me :


ROA : insufflated

Dose : 3-7mg

Come-up : 2h

Onset : 12h

Come-Down : 4h

Antidepressant after-effects : 30-48h (start at T+16h)

Concerning after-effects : 30-48h (start at T+46-64h)

Small dose of 3-HO (3mg) and a microdose of acid is pretty good for a blissfull day where you need to be functional. 

Also for me no antidepressant effect afterwards (only done up to 12 mg) orally.

Do you guys feel like Dissos are actually neurotoxic?

What about using 3-ho-pcp often?


IMO there are negative after effects, a hangover, depression, lowered mood. Feeling guilty of using the substance.


But the intoxication is so good...


Perhaps psychedelics would be healthier for the brain(clearly).


Are Dissos damaging to the brain? We have no evidence I know, only anecdotes based on what we feel. I suppose using drugs to feel better and get things done can aid ones life in the short term, showing us a side of us that we can actually attain naturally by just trying...


I love and hate Dissos! 

I feel like they help so much but I worry about the negative effects. I eat extremely healthy, and Dissos help me with motivation....


But in the end, is it having a negative impact on my brain?


I would almost compare it to meth use(far from meth I know). But I find Dissos to be highly functional and comfortable, helping me get further in life(no depression/anxiety/increased motivation).


How damaging is it really in your experience?


Why is there so little discussion of 3-ho-pcp?


I love reading insights from others!!

I like these recent Disco conversations a lot. I've been doing some personal research myself for years. The past 6 months, I've been using 2-Oxo-PCE daily, in varying doses - and after using daily - 3-MeO-2-Oxo-PCE - 3-MeO-PCP - 3 MeO-PCE - Ketamine - which i remember seeing a long time ago was like 2-Oxo-PCQm ? Call me out if I'm wrong. I'm spacey. I also used to trip on Dextromethorphan for months at a time in my early 20's, and actually detoxed myself off a Heavy Heroin using Pattern for a few months Robotripping, but I ended up back in the Opiates eventually due to DXM's lack of being a practical daily substance. It just runs the body TOO hard and caused overheating issues more than anything else for me. I could only do it during the winter because I constantly was so warm on it, couldn't even enjoy it in the summer - even fully hydrated and with proper sleeping and eating. These new Disco's are fucking beauty, they're so Clean - when you get the good batches - they're so Insightful and Human and Alien a the same time. I call them Forced Meditation Sessions - because, I know I'm not physically addicted in any way - I've quit massive times over the years, for years at a time. But I always come back. Because the insights and flexibility of use patterns, and abuse patterns - they're healthier than ANY other drug I've been "Addicted" to. Opiates are a fucking Ball and Chain and can suck a dick. Meth is fun, but is SO Neurotoxic and reeks havoc on both Dopamine and Serotonin, and not only that - when you become an addict the vasoconstriction becomes so unmanageable that you can barely get your dick up if your a Guy...It takes your dick away, in a way - so does long term Cocaine Addiction. The entire time I've done Arylcyclohexylamines one thing that I've noticed - while they run your body hard, they feel very natural and have never caused me any form of long term mental or physical damage that could not be repaired or figured out. 

The only thing I will say - I get lost a lot, like I gave up my compass for direction. I've lived in the same city periodically for a long time - and I get lost in the city I grew up in sometimes because I like to just Wander Around and kind of don't always care where I'm going even, I just like to be out and about - so when I try and find places sometimes, I get confused - but then I can focus my mind and run through a map of the pictures in my head of what places look like - and when I see a place once, like a business or particular friends house that I value - I can picture what it looks like, and my mind Maps me how to get there by visually reminding me which roads I need to use - but for the most part, east west north south - up down sideways, my brain just flows like water, it doesn't give a fuck about directions. It's straight liquid with the Universe and down for whatever at this point. Some might call it Schizophrenia - but I call it beauty, and I think that these sexy compounds might have a lot of answers in them that Humans have wished we had for a very very long time.


Do you guys feel like Dissos are actually neurotoxic?


NO NO maybe in strange way, but I don't think it's actually neurologically damaging in any way that can't be fixed altered or repaired. It seems like NMDA regulation is JUST as important as Dopamine and Serotonin to me. Maybe even more so. But one interesting thing that I've noticed about doing TOO much 2-Oxo-PCE or 3-MeO-PCP or 3-MeO-PCE.....when I get TOO Far out there - I've learned to go and get some Methamphetamine, and when I'm getting into that land of "I think I'm Jesus, I've found all the answers".....I'll smoke some Speed, just 2-3 hits, but good ones - and it IMMEDIATELY brings me back into my full state of Consciousness. It takes the dreaminess away and gives be a boot of Reality if you call it that - but I also counteract the Speed - BY CONSTANTLY SMOKING SWEET sweet cheeba Mary Jane. Weed is the one thing that sometimes - while the Physical buzz is WAY TOO INTENSE after using Disco's heavy for a minute. Weed puts me in my place sometimes like I need it to. It put's Disco's in CHECK if you're using them too much. But if you're not using them too much, it just enhances the experience - at least for me. All of this could just work strictly for My Chemistry...but regardless I want to share it. I'm not an example - or someone to trust my word - I want EVERYTHING to be questioned, and answered, and then questioned again and answered again - because Humans are the variable in the equation of Life. We are the Wild Card. Each of our own Chemistry is So Unique, that we have to learn to help each other understand by sharing our experiences - but also we have to learn to understand and respect that what works and keeps working for You, or for Me - isn't wrong or right always, it just....... Is. It is what it is. Which can be nothing, something, or everything in between. That's the true nature of our universe. 

Dynamic, Controlled, Chaos. I'm trying to smoke a spliff my G's and G-ettes. Take care of yourselves with love and peace. It's not about Race, Color, or Creed - It's about whether or not You'd Help A Brother in Need. - MEOWFISH Out. RIP VORTECH

Trying to abuse this as a stimulant replacement. At 1-2mg insufflated it at least does not work contraindicated, as far as I can tell. 8( Have to be really careful with the dose, though ... and avoid redosing.

It is definitely effective as a stimulant but only at very low (micro) doses. I had 2mg and ~2mg at T+4h (and I got low to moderate tolerance). The doses were too high and now I cannot sleep at T+14h. Also the effects were too recreational as in manic (urge to socialize and then I could not stop talking ... really annoying) and shortly after each redose you got those opioid-like (it rather feels like paracetamol) effects, that I try to avoid.


Next trial will be 0.5mg and 0.5mg at T+5h. This is so much more potent than 3-Meo-PCP (for me) ...

So nobody experiments with this ? I will wait with the next reply until the count hits 120. Promised. (?)


By the way : Even at 0.5-1mg doses it is not really suitable as a functional stimulant in a (purely) mentally demanding setting. Next trials will be initiated for creative embellishments only.

I should have some 3-HO-PCP coming in next week. Haven't played with any dissociatives aside from DXM in a long time. O-PCE accompanied me through most of 2016 and the beginning of 2017. I'll post my thoughts here. Maybe write a full experience report too. I tend to start big then use dissociatives daily or almost daily in small doses until they're gone, but I'm kind of doing this to reset me after quitting alcohol tobacco and cannabis, so I'll likely be taking a more modest approach to focus on self-control and spirituality. Will update soon

My trials with the grey batch were much like drug addiction BUT I have been left with a much better mood! I was dosing and redosing in a way where I accidentally holed more than once. The day before I ran out I actually dosed, redosed, and perhaps a little more before I had an event scheduled with some people. I had to stay home for about an hour until my semi hole dispersed.


Anyways aside from the initial intoxication, the after effects are something to write home about. I would be "hypomanic" for up to 6 hours. Zero anxiety, lots of confidence, happiness, interest and motivation.


The negative effects were mostly cognitive impairment; trouble spelling and remembering things. I actually feel a little dumber since I started my 3-ho experimenting BUT much happier.


I did things I wouldn't normally have done, was more social, ate better, developed further with my relationships. I was pretty depressed before so I'm happy where I am now just a little unhappy about the memory loss and trouble spelling.


I was dosing almost everyday often times multiple times a day. Started small and tolerance developed quickly. When I would wait a few days to dose, my tolerance was higher than if I dosed two or more days in a row.


My experiences with 3-pce and 3-pcp were daily abuse as well but much more side effects and unhappiness in the end.


I honestly don't want to touch a disso again even though I love them. I feel like they are garbage for the brain. I'm much more interested in psychedelic trips and microdosing. The microdosing of 1p improved my life significantly a couple years ago.

The white was top 3 drugs I've done, the grey was dirty and kind of shit overall (won't be repeating buy from that place>)

As an absolute MXE worshipper in the past, I was sent into a real spin when it disappeared. I had stocks but they gradually dwindled... I tried a couple of the analogues like 3-meo-pce, 3-meo-pcp and 0-PCE and didn't get along with any of them. Far too much mania which ended up with incidents including me having a massive argument with my dad (bearing in mind I'm approaching middle age), scaring my wife after becoming unresponsive... not like my beloved MXE which I could take regularly but easily keep my life together.


I finally got the chance to try 3-ho-pcp last week. Wow - I am seriously impressed. I have finally found something that can at least partially fill the huge void left by MXE! The best way to describe it is MXE-lite - I get the zen feeling of contentment, but the headspace is clearer, you can interact with normal people without seeming too intoxicated - and it wears off quicker, leaving you at baseline with fewer after effects than MXE. Some would argue that less afterglow is a bad thing, but for me it's good as it lets you get on with your life. Combines lovely with weed just like MXE - great to for socialising, watching movies and gaming.


I have yet to try higher doses and have not been anywhere near hole territory yet, so haven't got anything spiritually or mentally profound out of it. But I'm not really in the market for that - I'm just looking for a stress-relieving distraction that's easy on the body and mind, and this fits the bill perfectly.


So if you're looking for a more out-there experience with visuals etc, this may not be for you. But it seems to fit me perfectly and has definitely lifted the "MXE-ban-cloud" that was hanging over my head!


Enjoy and stay safe guys! Thanks for all your input on these chemicals - it's a great help when navigating these unchartered waters...

Anyone out there still enjoying 3-HO-PCP? As usual I'm late to the party, but I finally have some and I'm about to try it now! I have a moderate dissociative tolerate from weekly use, so I'm going to weigh out 8mg, split that into four bumps, then titrate up 2mg at a time (intranasal). It worked great when I first tried O-PCE, so it should work fine here (but I'm suspecting that 8mg of this will be slightly stronger in effect that 8mg of O-PCE).


Should be loads of fun! Wish me luck ladies and gents, hope you all are having a fantastic day!

That was fucking amazing, beautiful dissociative bliss. So euphoric and warm and fuzzy. I'm going to lay down and listen to dubstep until I fall asleep. Total dose was ~12mg intranasal.


I'm not 100% sure yet, but I think I prefer this over O-PCE. I will need to do more research to find out, and I really should take a break because my tolerance is getting higher and higher.

Has anyone come across a weak batch of 3-ho-pcp? I don't want to source, but can indicate what country it came from if allowed. It is white, very crystally and ketamine-like in appearance, although a lot easier on the nose. I can take 25mg of regular 3-ho-pcp for a nice hit, but with this batch I can snort 100mg and not feel much - can go up to 400mg before feeling mildly chilled and dissociated. Anyone come across this?

That sounds like 2f-dck based on appearance and dose.

If your vendor carries both maybe there was a mix up.

That's really useful to know, thanks. I'd never tried 2f-dck so that could be it

I'm also surprised there isn't a bit more chatter regarding this one. I've tried 3-MeO-PCP, 3-MeO-PCE, and now this one and I find it to be the absolute best of the three. It's easily the most euphoric and closest in effects to MXE. The only downside is its long legs (similar to the aforementioned two compounds) and it kept me from sleeping for a good long while (12+ hours).

ok so the way most careful, conscientious partakers do things dissos are more likely to heal any brain injury and regenerate nerve tissue without causing any harm whatsoever in fact healing curing reviving dead nerve cells.

Have you tried 2-oxo-PCE (deschloro-N-ethyl-Ketamine) yet? Maybe it's just the batches I have, but O-PCE seems to be much more euphoric than 3-HO-PCP.


I haven't tried MXE, but based on what other people are saying O-PCE is similar in effects to MXE.

O-PCE is close in many ways 3-MeO-PCP isn't, and, it's not very similar. Much more speedy and manic IME. No magic like MXE, though you can go pretty deep during holes.

I really like 3-ho-pcp. It's especially good during movies like dxm. It makes music immediately sound amazing especially grinding drum and bass. 

The opiate analgesia is stronger than what I've read on here. I dosed it while two days off of my daily dose of 115mg methadone and it got me off sick.. And when taking it on methadone I actually caught a nod several times which is very difficult to achieve when on methadone. 

All and all the only complaint is when I took a little too much a couple times and had that bad trip feeling that some people may relate to a third plateau dxm. Kind of like that feeling of imminent death while not being exactly sure why.. I just got the vibe I was definitely dying. It happened a couple of times. Thank God for my girlfriend trip sitting me she actually did something really smart and rubbed noopept under my tongue. She never took pcp and I never told her I was tripping out. 

I almost instantly felt normal and I asked her in awe why did you do that? 

She said you feel better don't you? You looked like you were afraid you were dying or something. 

And I was like ya but how'd you? Why's? How'd you do this? 

SHE was like isn't 3hopcp an nmda antagonist? 

YA. 

Well noopept is an nmda agonist. 

I was in fucking shock. My girlfriend was a hero to me in that moment. I would have never known she knew a damn thing about nmda. 

I was like but how.. Studder Studder 

She said just doing my job as a trip sitter now shut up and have a beer. 

I did both.

I haven't had it tested, but from all of the research I've done it's got to be one of the precursors used in the synth (would it be against the rules to list the most common ones regularly seen in contaminated PCP (and it's analogs) samples?)


I agree with you completely, I used the grey stuff quite compulsively for a while and it REALLY fucked me up mentally. I couldn't think at all and my emotions went completely haywire. I couldn't control myself at all. I had to throw it out. If you mix the stuff into a solution and smell the water, it reeks of almonds which makes me think it's contaminated with 1-piperidinocyclohexanecarbonitrile (which has a characteristic almond like odor). If it were contaminated with piperidine or 1-piperidino-cyclohexane it would smell fishy, literally. 


The white batch is superior in so many ways that it doesn't even feel like the same drug to me. I'm very happy that I got some but unfortunately I've gone through half a g in around 25 days (I've picked up quite the habit with the stuff). Fun times, eh?


Hope you are having a good day Treezy!

Yeah, I'm pretty sure that any laboratory that performs tests on drug samples will have the reference standard for PCC, and should have no issues detecting PCC or other common arylcyclohexylamine precursors in a given sample. Are you thinking about having yours tested? I have some of the grey batch as well but I simply don't have the funds right now to pay $100 for the test to be done.


I wish I knew somebody that lives in one of the countries that offers free laboratory testing. Either way if you do decide to have it tested please keep us all posted as to the results!

Yes I used the former in that matter and it worked rather fine. 3-Meo-PCP is the most functional disso out there for analytical tasks, it does not increase your performance, but it provides a manic boost, without interfering with logical thinking at very low doses. It was even better than most stimulants in that regard for me.


3-Ho-PCP is more of a mixed bag. It is even more potent, longer lasting and more unpredictable than 3-Meo, it is too potent and long lasting to be spontaneuosly administered. But it is not that stimulating (in a dopaminergic sense), rather more relaxing and perhaps more opioid. It works also as an anti-depressive substance at ~t+24h until t+72h at threshold doses (2-4mg insufflated) for me. Afterwards (>t+72h) I always experienced a rather annoying crash for 24h-48h, accompanied by joint pain and aggressive tendencies. I concluded, that this substance is nothing to fuck with. I have a bad relationship with drugs, that have such a long elimination half life and are of such potency. They can wreak havoc on your everyday-life.


Stick to your guns if you can. This substance is not really suited for functional purposes but great for uninhibited recreation I suppose. I like it more than 2-Oxo-PCE.


My ranking for arylcyclohexylamines is like this (all are quite interesting, but I prefer the more stimulating ones) :


3-Meo-PCP > 3-Meo-PCE > 3-Ho-PCP > 2-Oxo-PCM > 2-Oxo-PCE

They're for producing interesting altered states.  Not all disssociatives are good for holing, and holing is only one use for them.  A lot of people use lower doses of ketamine and don't try to hole, for the other types of effects it has.

I've tried dabbling with dissos as well, 3-HO-PCP and O-PCE, but I also think I don't quite 'get' them. 


The mental effects are very confusing, and imo not very enjoyable, it felt like poison for my brain. Especially O-PCE took a really long time, and I felt very confused and not on point well into the next day. I'll try snorting O-PCE, and maybe upping my dosage because I don't want to give up on these chemicals although maybe they just don't agree with me..

It took me a while to "get" dissociatives too.  I tried MXE a handful of times before I "got it"... I didn't like it, I found it uncomfortable and weird, it made me kind of anxious.  Then I had an experience where I got the full range of effects and I loved it, and it became one of my favorite drugs.  It was the same for basically any disso I've tried, I never like them much at first.


That said, I think psychedelics are better drugs.  Dissos have too much of the escapism/addictive nature to them.  I will say, though, that a good dissociative hole experience is a totally unique and utterly fascinating/mindblowing thing that is worth experiencing.

I think 3-HO-PCP in low to mid doses can be really helpful for being productive (for tasks which are not that mentally challenging) or just enjoy what you're doing more. For me, it often is cleaning/tidying up the house or just playing Overwatch ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

It was even better than most stimulants in that regard for me.

But it is not that stimulating (in a dopaminergic sense), rather more relaxing and perhaps more opioid. It works also as an anti-depressive substance at ~t+24h until t+72h at threshold doses (2-4mg insufflated) for me. Afterwards (>t+72h) I always experienced a rather annoying crash for 24h-48h, accompanied by joint pain and aggressive tendencies. I concluded, that this substance is nothing to fuck with. I have a bad relationship with drugs, that have such a long elimination half life and are of such potency. They can wreak havoc on your everyday-life.

I'd agree that 3-meo-pcp is extremely functional and provides a nice manic boost similar to stimulants but in it's own way. High doses will make you too stupid for any real work.


Not sure if I'd agree regarding the duration, for me 3-ho-pcp definitely lasts less long. It is slightly more potent but both are extremely potent so the difference is most likely beyond what your scale can measure.


There is definitely less (noticeable) stimulation but if you take it at night you'll note that sleeping without a benzo is practically impossible for at least a few h even though you feel more relaxed.


Never noticed any opioid effects, but there are studies that say it has them.


No crash for me nor joint pain and aggressive tendencies.


Imo 3-ho-pcp ~ o-pce > 3-meo-pcp ~ 3-meo-pce > 2f-dck > dck > 3-ho-pce>>>> ephenidine >>>>>> diphenidine ~ 2-meo-phenidine (the last two only being good for throwing away), and ephenidine being decent, but too expensive per dose, builds tolerance too fast and lasts too long

I dosed 20mg 3-ho-pcp (I obviously have some tolerance, start lower with  it than me, it is stronger than 3-meo-pcp) and 2mg etilozam about 2  hours ago. While sipping some coca tea and smoked a tiny bit of hash. I  feel very nice and fluffy, like being packed into blankets, just watching colourful movies. They are kinda 3D now. I  find 3-ho-pcp stronger than 3-meo-pcp, it makes me feel really  melting into stuff. It is really relaxing, soft, warm and nice. 


I will write a proper trip report later on.

Does anyone have a high opiate tolerance and still feels a opiate like high with 3-ho-pcp?

Im asking because I have a opiate tolerance of about 60mg Oxycodone and the last time with 3-ho-pcp the experience was very lacking. But maybe this was because my batch looked very impure. I want to give this substance a another try.

It will absolutely cause a false positive for pcp.


A pcp dipstick-type test (where the line either appears or doesn’t) tests for the piperidine ring—the pcp molecule has a piperidine ring, thus so do the 3-ho and 3-meo derivatives.


The pce/eticyclidine derivatives will not cause positives for pcp, assuming they are pure—although the line that does appear may be very faint, in my experience.

I can take 25mg of regular 3-ho-pcp for a nice hit, but with this batch I can snort 100mg and not feel much - can go up to 400mg before feeling mildly chilled and dissociated.

Perhaps you have a PCM-O derivative; I was sold some as 3-MeO-PCE and it gas doses like what you say; left me mildly dissociatived.

Makes sense since MXE is 3-MeO-2-Oxo-PCE; it’s mxe without the 3-MeO chain

O-PCE is more similar to MXE than the 3 sub -PCPs, but it's not that similar. It's extremely stimulating, it doesn't have the magic that both MXE and DXM have, the hole is cold, the headspace it gives is chaotic and not so organized or beautiful, etc. It's also prone to paranoia - at least for me. It's nice, but after getting some in 2016 I've only used it 5-8 times.


Where it does shine is microdosing, considering the stimulation. It's nice stimulation plus a slightly expanded headspace.

I have such a tolerance from MXE that I barely felt 2-Oxo-PCE even at 20-30mg IM... the pcp analogues seem to be more effective—I should receive my 3-HO-PCP tomorrow and will definitely report back.


I’m probably going to IM 10mg to start and possibly another 5-10 depending on how it hits

What is the news on the K with 3-OH-PCP ?

i have 2-FDCK and think that should be similar, but possibly with a more mobile hole. the DEA intercepted my K and i don't know what 3-OH-PCP would allow them to do to me, if they intercepted it, (and if they're watching me. And if i should edit this part out of my post ?); but, i was interested in the combo of it with 2-FDCK. So a report on K with 3-OH-PCP should give an alright idea.


i think i'd be safe to go for 3-OH-PCPy but i don't know if it is even remotely active, similar, and importanly available.

I IM’d 15mg total (over 20 or 30 min in 3 shots) and had a crazy time. At one point, I felt like I was God, at least that is the best I can describe it. Later, I was convinced that the world is a computer simulation; I remember seeing circuit boards and shit manifesting in my open-eyed visuals.


I go hard in the mother fucking paint.


I went through 150mg in a weekend and still made it to work (and did a great Job making pizza) in-between binges. Dunno how. I remember not sleeping Sunday night and thinking I wasnt gonna be okay Monday evening for work, but I was fine in the end.

Well this is a very interesting substance. Finally had the chance and the inclination to try it just yesterday. Ate 5mg ish, no effects of note really, perhaps I noticed a kind of slight anxiety which I remember also feeling on the 3-MeO-PCP comeup, snorted another 5mg after an hour or so, at this point I was starting to feel something, but still effects were somewhat minor... another hour later I snorted another 10mg ish, shortly after that obviously things started to kick in. I remember overall feeling quite good, excited, slightly manic. I decided to try to get the bus to visit some friends, had a minor panic where I couldn't find my keys just before I left, this was threatening to turn me into a much more panicky state of mind, but I remembered a very similar thing happening during my 3-MeO-PCP adventures quite some time ago, where a minor annoyance threatened to take on massive and trip-altering significance, so I was able to talk myself down a little, or perhaps this substance is just a little less volatile.


Anyway on venturing out into the world I started to think this was perhaps a mistake, I had to cross a road to get to the bus stop, fortunately there was an underpass instead so I thought this might be the safer option... but I had to descend some stone stairs, and this task seemed surprisingly daunting... I managed it slowly and carefully however, but then when making it to the bus stop, there were an unappealing amount of people there, and again, I started to feel uncertain about the task before me... walking through the underpass tunnel I remember experiencing relative size distortions and feeling that the tunnel was very small and cartoonlike almost, whereas the stairs in comparison, had seemed very large and imposing... I must have walked around the small area near where I live a couple of times, almost giving up on the idea then thinking come on, it's not that much, just walk over there, get on the bus and chill out, but eventually, perhaps quite wisely, I just gave up and went home, and I think in retrospect that was the smart decision. Once I started to come down a bit i remember feeling very nice, but I think I unwisely obliterated the afterglow by doing some ketamine, which I barely even enjoy anymore honestly a lot of the time, really need to knock that one on the head.


I definitely like this substance a lot more than 3-MeO-PCP which is a verifiable psychotogen, IMO. A little more caution with dose, setting and planning probably warranted...

I definitely like 3-HO-PCP more than 3-MeO-PCP, too.  3-HO-PCP can produce mania/psychosis like all dissos can is pushed too far, but 3-MeO is just a head fucker, one of the most delusional drugs I've ever encountered.  3-HO is much warmer and more calm/in control, it doesn't deceive you in the same way.  Feels better in the body, too.  I'd do it again if offered.  However I like 3-MeO-PCE a lot more than either.

This feels remarkably different from 3-MeO-PCP. Very relaxing, somewhat dissociative. In a blind test, I probably would not guess it was even a PCP analogue (though I have not tried high doses, nor do I intend to).


Overall, I definitely enjoy this more than the crazy-making 3-MeO-PCP, but it's not quite what I'm looking for in a dissociative. I personally think it might be more recreational than 3-MeO, as long as you're planning a quiet night watching something or listening to music, as it can be pretty sedating. I actually fell asleep for 3 hours after snorting 5mg once (was kind of nice, but I woke up slightly confused). It's not bad, and I will continue to try it, but I'm not dying to push things too far. It's a mild experience at 2-5mg snorted, and I think I'm fine with that for now (I am overly cautious with these PCP analogues). At higher doses it might have more of what I want (I enjoy full immersion), but I've read about people blacking out and doing weird shit, so I'm going to pass on that. I'm a Ketamine head all the way, it seems. Of all the newer ACHs, 2-FDCK is easily the best, short duration and all (though I never got to try DCK). To be honest, even MXE was too all over the place for me, even though it felt quite wonderful. I suppose if I'm going to be dissociated and exploring inner worlds, I'd rather be immobile.


Edit: I also discovered this pretty much ameliorates the withdrawal symptoms from a 5 year Kratom habit. I still wake up in a cold sweat, and sweat randomly thoughout the day with shivers, but almost all of the other symptoms are gone or severely blunted. I don't even crave it (but I do slightly crave 3-HO-PCP, lol). Yay. Also, I feel great the day after. My worst problem with Kratom withdrawal was the suicidal ideation and anger that would kick in about 24 hours after my last dose. None of that today,  and it's been over 24 hours. That combination is very dangerous, if you aren't aware. All in all, this is what I was expecting from 3-MeO-PCP (plus energy and euphoria), glad to get it from this at least. I probably will push the dosage a little higher, but cautiously so, I can't afford blacking out at this point in my life.


For the record, I snorted 2mg, then 5mg, then 5mg last evening, spaced several hours apart. I have moderate disso tolerance (example: I cannot currently hole on a hole dose of 2-FDCK, but it does mess me up). I had some trouble sleeping, but unlike the 3-MeO, I didn't mind laying in bed with my eyes closed listening to a documentary for a few hours until I drifted off. Did have to take 500mg L-Theanine and 1mg of Ativan to fall asleep, though (the 3-MeO ate those alive.... that stuff requires etizolam or alpazolam!).

Bit off-topic but I found 2F-DCK basically unholeable. Maybe tolerance played some part but I always found it to be just shallower than most another dissociatives... Maybe for an entirely dissociative naive person a hole would be achievable though.


DCK had a lot more depth, although unfortunately this seems to have disappeared, I had a bunch but I seem to have a somewhat questionable habit of flushing dissociatives when I start thinking they're not doing me any good rather than just locking them up somewhere for later... like maybe years later... but this is hard to arrange... Maybe this is just nostalgic rose tinted glasses but I hope it pops up again sometime.

I agree with your assessment. 2f-dck seemed very shallow. It gives the wonky feeling but lacks any sort of psychedelic effects. 

DCK on the other hand can be very psychedelic. The holes on it are deep and feel mystical.

I've found that I enjoy 3-HO-PCP a little bit too much! Despite the fact that I've been taking it regularly (but not daily), 250mg lasts about 2 months. It is the only dissociative I've done that I've felt is somewhat functional (at low to moderate doses). All the others caused too many cognitive, memory, or emotional issues after a while, and other people definitely noticed! With this, I can be quite surreptitious in my drug use ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) Of course, it does mess with my memory and my time perception, among other things, but not debilitatingly so. Sometimes, it induces a state of tiredness not unlike an opiate nod, where all I can do is lay down in bed in a warm blanket and drift off. Usually, it has me up and doing things, though. I've also found it has some distinct phases, sometimes switching between outright dissociation and something more like dissociation plus a stimulant high (but without the jitteriness of stimulants). I've done things like reinstalled Linux servers while on it, wrote short fiction that was subsequently published, and contributed to open-source programming projects, so I know it's not producing the delusions of sobriety that 3-MeO-PCP can induce. Mostly, I love it for it's calming and mood boosting effects. Also, it makes me so interested in doing things I might otherwise not want to do (I suffer from anhedonia normally).


The only health issue I've noticed is that it definitely triggers GERD/acid reflux symptoms, but that is not suprising, as anything stimulating does that to me. Unfortunately, the acid reflux symptoms do not respond to my normal medication while on this, and it can be frustrating. This forces me to moderate my usage to some extent. Bladder seems fine as far as I know. My nose is not particularly happy (my preferred ROA is insufflation... and also the acid reflux probably doesn't help!), but that's about it. I drink plenty of water, take vitamins, and eat regularly, and I suggest you do the same if you're going to use dissociatives on semi-regular basis. I will be taking a break when I run out after the holidays, mostly to be sure I can control myself. Like I said, I really, really like this stuff. I keep the doses low though, never more than 10mg snorted at once (with tolerance). I have no desire to go higher, having experienced a bad time only once or twice. It mostly consisted of me feeling like the experience was too intense in a way I couldn't place. I wasn't having a particularly strong body load or visuals, it just felt like "too much" and I couldn't enjoy the experience at all, and wished it would go away. Other than that, this is like the best aspects of all of my favorite drugs (heroin, ketamine, amphetamines), which I suppose is probably a little dangerous. ;-)

I finally tried 3-HO-PCP. It's quite potent as I didn't take much more than around 12mg.


Even for a dissociative it seemed very emotionally distant. Not too euphoric either. Someone asked me if I was having fun and I replied that I wouldn't necessarily call it fun, but that I was enjoying myself. The best aspect of it was the incredible relaxation. I mostly laid on the couch for a few hours while listening to music and moving as little as possible.


At one point I lightly holed while contemplating the nature of the sound waves propagating towards me from the speakers. My thinking during that time was crystal clear but then when I stood up I felt very out of it. People mention a blackout state being easily reached with 3-HO-PCP and I could sense the seeds of that in this experience. I think I remained aware throughout but it was still a bit concerning to go from thinking very clearly to suddenly feeling as if there were potentially gaps in my memory.


No desire to do anymore today although I did trial 3-HO-PCE for the first time instead. I actually think 3-HO-PCE reminds me more of 3-MeO-PCP whereas 3-HO-PCP reminds me more of 3-MeO-PCE.

I've been using it for a year almost every week. Still my favorite dissociative available. After a year, my dose is still 15mg. I've gone over my limit only 1-2 times, by over my limit I mean 2-3 redoses. Other than that I've never had a problem. I love watching movies/shows with it just like I loved watching with MXE. If I redose, I only do one time. Only downside for me is that I definitely need to use a benzo to sleep as I mostly do it at night time. Using VR with it is mind blowing. It also has a perfect synergy with 3-meo-pce.

Have you ever noticed any of the blackout-type effects with 3-HO-PCP? The only other dissociative I've ever noticed them with was MXE, but that's likely just from doses that were way too high.

I've had one experience where I didn't really understand what the fuck happened during trip which was a direct result of 2 redoses I guess. I'm trying to not overdo it, so I'm usually not in black out territory.

I love this compound. So much better than 3-MEO-PCP. I have the off-white batch that is the consistency of salt (EU synth?). It crushes very nicely and never sticks to anything, seems very pure. 12mg intranasal is my go-to dose, it is so tranquil and zen-like. It doesn't burn at all, nor is there much of a drip. The same dose of the flowery/clumpy 3-MEO-PCP I had would burn my nostrils and give me a bit of bloody mucus.


This is perfect for listening to music, watching a movie etc. The color saturation is a nice touch; it's almost as if the warmness of the psychic effects mirror the visuals. The anti-depressive effects are very apparent the next day. It is right up there with Ketamine in my opinion, although it is better used as a recreational/relaxing drug, whereas Ketamine is spiritually invigorating. 


I have some 3-MEO-PCE on the way, so I'm interested to see how that compares. I doubt that I'll like it more, though. I like how sedating/opiate-like this is. 


I did 12mg a few days ago, and I am on the same dose right now. It does not leave you mentally stunted like 3-MEO-PCP does. I can write and think clearly. After this, however, I'll take a few weeks off from NMDA antagonism because I don't want to lose the magic of this drug. I'd say it is most comparable to a perfect 2nd plateau DXM trip, but without all the negative side effects. I'm glowing.


Cheers

I like 3-MeO-PCE a little better, but 3-HO-PCP is definitely nice stuff, much nicer than 3-MeO-PCP.  3-MeO-PCE is pretty similar to 3-HO-PCP, except mellower and more psychedelic.  For me, anyway.

I am excited to try it out. It seems like they compliment one another very well. If it gets even mellower and more psychedelic than this, then I am in for a treat.

Got a chance to try 3-meo-pce (think I'll go drop by and post in that thread if it is active at all). Definitely more mellow, probably half as potent, seems like a bit of serotonergic activity which is nice, but doesn't compare to 3-HO-PCP which is the crown jewel of dissos on the market right now imo.

Love this stuff.  12mg was superb, some paranoia on the back end.  Make sure to drink plenty of water on this one. 


I was really dehydrated from work and took this and was wondering why it was lasting so bloody long.  I swear It was recycling from my bladder, damn you lipophilicity! This compound causes diaphoresis  of feet and hands in particular.  I stress drink water on this compound.


I am on tail end as we speak.  F-phenibut 200mg and large amounts of water were tremendous comedown aides. Cannabis on the tail end is also nice but paranoia ramping factor so be careful.  I never get paranoid on cannabis alone.

Had a lovely trip on 3-HO-PCP a couple days ago, decided to do it at a party, took 17mg (fairly high dose for some, but I have a bit of a tolerance from years of dissociative use) before my friend and I headed out and I had an exceptionally good time. Socializing was easy despite some mild issues talking (stuttering and whatnot) which didn't bother me since everyone was fucked up anyway. I played banjo alongside my friend who was on acoustic and it sounded pretty good, my ideas flowed easily and I felt like I was able to access any note on the fretboard with ease. I've always felt like I play a hell of a lot better on dissociatives, I'm more creative and my ideas flow easier, I've even gone back and listened to recordings of myself after the fact and they still held up. The boost in creativity is probably one of my favorite things about dissociatives. This one isn't as good to make music on as 3-MEO-PCP as it's much more debilitating and less stimulating, but it's still wonderful.


It's such a warm dissociative, I typically have pretty bad social anxiety but I had no issues this time, despite it being a pretty loud house party with a few people I didn't know. It felt great to socialize and catch up with old friends. I just love the feeling of being detached but somewhat manic and very euphoric while dissociated in a social setting, I kept thinking about how high I was and how safe I felt and just had a shit eating grin the whole time.


When we got back I redosed another 10mg as I had pretty much come down by then and was just enjoying the afterglow. Sat down to play some Red Dead Redemption 2 on my friend's massive TV and found myself getting sucked into it, the immersion was rather intense. I highly recommend playing video games on this stuff, I particularly love games with realistic graphics, I get really immersed in the experience, RDR2 in particular is amazing. After an hour or so I went on a walk, it was about 5AM at the time and pitch black. The moment I got outside I started dancing a bit (I was out in the middle of nowhere, only reason I felt comfortable doing this) and then started walking up a dirt road a bit. I didn't go far but it was very tranquil and peaceful walking around in the dead of night under the stars.


All in all I'd say 3-HO-PCP is one of my favorite dissociatives, up there with MXE, DCK, 3-MEO-PCP and 3-MEO-PCE, which are my personal favorites. I didn't like it much at first but after a few trips it really started to grow on me. I've been afterglowing for the couple days after and I've been in a great mood in general, very little anxiety and the antidepressant effects are very apparent, even two days after the fact.


Note: All the doses I've listed here are very high due to having a high tolerance, I wouldn't recommend anyone take 27mg in one night, even if you spaced it out as I did. Start very low and work your way up, it's a very potent drug. Stay informed and stay safe, everyone.

so I’ve done only about 100mg of the 250mg I received 2 months ago, but I just ordered another gram, which should last me indefinitely. Gonna throw 250mg in the freezer and save it for the end times. This is the best drug I’ve ever tried. All other dissos (i have a small bag of everything on the market right now) are good, but I don’t feel the need to use them very often anymore, so this will probably be my last drug purchase for a long time. I’ve spent too much in the last 6 months (street MDMA/mushrooms have gotten insanely pricey...) and why buy anymore of anything when I have 100+ doses of 3-ho-pcp on hand? Feels good to have found a drug that feels like it was made for you.


as a side note, I don’t find this fiendish at all. I had a much more difficult time controlling my intake of 3-meo-pcp. And ketamine/DCK/2f are more addicting to me because they’re shorter lasting/have less after effects the next day. 3-ho-pcp lends itself to ritualistic use for me. I’m fine with doing it once a month and not much more because it loses its magic quickly.

I've had Lasik and used dissociatives after, not right after mind you, in fact I think I wasn't really using dissociatives that much during that time in my life and the "recovery period", so to speak, although I did use some other drugs within probably 2 weeks. IIRC it's probably best to abstain from anything too hard on your system for about that time at least, because while your eyes are still healing you don't want anything to interrupt the healing process, by affecting tear production or otherwise. It hasn't been studied to my knowledge but I wouldn't be surprised if dissociatives dry your eyes out a little just from the general whole body anaesthesia and possible interference with autonomic functions such as blinking and normal eye movement. Other than that, nothing of note to report IMO/IME.

IIRC it's probably best to abstain from anything too hard on your system for about that time at least, because while your eyes are still healing you don't want anything to interrupt the healing process, by affecting tear production or otherwise. It hasn't been studied to my knowledge but I wouldn't be surprised if dissociatives dry your eyes out a little just from the general whole body anaesthesia and possible interference with autonomic functions such as blinking and normal eye movement. Other than that, nothing of note to report IMO/IME.

Thanks so much man, great points, specially the one with autonomic functions as I've noticed that my blinking frequency is way less than normal which is great for watching stuff and VR, but it wouldn't be good for my current situation I guess. I'm healing way faster than I thought, but better safe than sorry. 

I've smoked weed each day so far without any complications, but regarding dissociatives I was not so sure.

No problem, although I would say reduced blinking frequency is not really ever a good thing, if you notice yourself blinking less you should maybe try to consciously blink when you remember. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png) Especially post-LASIK where reduced corneal sensitivity might also aggravate dry-eye symptoms. Although it seems there's a lot of variability in recovery rates and how susceptible people are to this. Personally I also had a very quick recovery and just as an off-topic aside for anyone considering LASIK, I'd recommend it to anyone. Ideally I'd avoid the budget high street clinics which tend to have a greater percentage of negative outcomes - especially if they're still using a mechanical scalpel to make the initial flap rather than a laser-only procedure. Although for sure the vast majority of people will still have good results wherever they get it, despite the occasional scare story as of right now it's a pretty mature and by most measures pretty amazing technology and I wouldn't be surprised if in the next couple of decades it becomes routinely offered in high street ophthalmologists instead of contacts or glasses.

Thanks for the info again. I think blinking less only happens when I lose myself in VR :D 7 days passed since surgery and I feel totally normal now. My eyes are not even getting dry like they were few days ago. I'm still using all prescribed eye drops of course. I tried DCK last night and didn't experience any problems. Most of the times my eyes were closed anyways. And I also found something cool accidentally. During peak, in which you can see CEVs, I decided to apply lubricant eye drop (Refresh Tears) just in case I won't understand if my eyes get dry or not. Whole living room was dark and my tv was open in front of me. 


The light coming from the tv + drops in my eyes somehow manipulated the hallucinative state that DCK gives. I found that opening  eyes tiny bit in those moments creates crazy CEVs, scenarios, places etc. Not enough to see outside, but just enough to let light enters your eyes through your eye lashes.

3-HO-PCP is seriously strong, as potent or more potent than 3-MeO-PCP.  I prefer it to 3-MeO-PCP, less delusional.

Would you mind explaining "less delusional" in a little more detail? What types of delusions do you get on 3-MeO-PCP that you might not on 3-HO-PCP? Most of my dissociative experience is with 3-MeO-PCP, but I have some 3-HO-PCP I'd also like to try at some point. Seeing this thread pop up and renewing my lurker status on BL during the pandemic has me excited to make the best of this time and explore my somewhat ignored collection.

I mean, 3-MeO-PCP gives delusions of sobriety.  It twists your thoughts up to where you think you're relatively normal, but you're behaving weirdly to everyone else.  This progresses into grandiosity and eventually psychosis if you push too hard.  Whereas 3-HO-PCP I found more like 3-MeO-PCE in that you remain much more grounded within yourself.

Ah, I see what you mean now. Sounds like it would be better for social or public events when that becomes a thing again in that case since awareness of intoxication level is more important. Still excited to give this one a try sometime soon.

I enjoyed 3-HO; 25-40 mg was just about right for me, but I have a massive tolerance for dissociatives. I do not recommend anyone to start with such a high dose, as this is a potent material. One thing I did notice is its lack of analgesic effect compared to other arylcyclohexylamines. PCP, 3-MeO-PCP, and even O-PCE have a much more pronounced analgesia than 3-HO-PCP. Pain perception is still very much intact with this stuff. It does have a very nice "warmth" to it, however. Overall a good drug, but not as fun as PCP itself. Much less manic than 3-MeO-PCP, which is nice. I have done actual PCP itself many times, and I would have to say that 3-MeO-PCP is as close as you can get, experience-wise, among the currently available RC dissociatives - much closer than 3-HO-PCP. Might order some more 3-HO at some point, as I did enjoy it quite a lot. I am curious as to exactly why the analgesic efficacy is so much less than similar compounds. Perhaps some research may shed light on this. Especially with this being a mu-opioid agonist, I'd be led to think it should have *more* analgesia, not less, but it's just not so...

I've regained a liking to this one. Overdoing it results in blacking out and waking up covered in blood and wine, but it doesn't seem to hurt other people. It gives a reasonable dissociation basis, and things like lysergics can be added for stimulation and depth. Hydration needs to be minded extra carefully, since it's dopey and you can just forget. On the after-effects, the 'opi' sadness and 'disso' afterglow seem to cancel each other out.


I like to start with 20mg, then redose with 10mg if needed. Reasonably compatible with exercise after one water flush. Appetite and sleep needs to be regained with CBD, alcohol, or fly agaric at the end of the day.

I keep messing up my wine rituals with this one though. This is the third wine glass I've broken. Knocked over the wine bottle for the third bloody time as well.


The bottle is intact this time at least, it's not literally bloody this time. But again, yet another puddle of liquid alarmingly encroaching upon defying proper distancing from electric outlets. 


I keep being tempted to push the limits, and every bloody times there's extremely interesting though awkward non-disaster.

Wow had an absolutely amazing experience with this yesterday. Only did like 20mg max over a few hours but had done a bit the day before. Also took the smallest amount of bromazolam and some cannabis. The plateau was something else. Just a sublime feeling of crystal clear euphoria and confidence for like 2 hours. Had been kind of in a lull the past month moping about my past relationship but this seems to have brought me out of it, at least temporarily.


I had tried the 3-HO-PCP ~10 times prior to this, but this experience was totally different. At first 3-HO-PCP was cold and uninviting and gradually became less so, but yesterday was just remarkable. The euphoria absolutely reminded me of MXE. Going to say this might be a top-3 disso for me along with MXE/DCK. I guess some dissos just have this gestation period because MXE/DCK were the same for me. Cold & uninviting at first and then this completely different qualitative character emerges after a handful of experiences.

I had a great mindspace on it with low dose lysergics, counteracting some of the dopiness. Then I had the dubious idea to redose the combo in the evening and add some cannabis, and now the window is broken. In my memory a force threw me out, in actuality I must have gone psychotic and damaged property for no reason.


So do be cautious. You can get away with daily use if you gently steer this one, but blanking out with broken shards is always around the corner.

Thanks for the response I'm not planning on daily use tried it a few times by itself at 8mg then a second  time with 8 and an 8 redose a few hours in seemed very void  and robotic. Not quite unpleasant but not quite enjoyable either. I'll try 8 again with 200ug and see what happens. Wondering  if it's anything like diphenidine and LSD feeling like something is in control of my body and I'm just along for the ride. Smoked a diphenidine joint while on 300ish ug and vaguely remember grabbing a step ladder from my garage and bringing it inside. Sort of went blank for a bit then found myself up the ladder trying to change a light bulb.

Yeah then it indeed gets into the diphenidine direction of things now you mention it... something we want to avoid regardless of whether we're sprinkling some dust on the LSD experience (shaving off some of the pointy bits of the trip I imagine) or blowing some microdosage bits of life into the void.


Especially with my approach you do have to combo as to liven it up a bit. The opioid dissociative anesthetic provides the blank slate framing, like a nice new room (which I happen to be in at the moment, in multiple ways, but that aside) as pains are dulled, and the weight of the past has been discounted. Herbal decoration is required, which can take many forms, like black or green tea, or perhaps cannabinoids. Liquids in the form of tea, which as opposed to George Orwell's skepticism nourishes and stabilizes the mind in exchange for the gentlest of kidney load if you happen to simmer the fuck out of 'em and release the heavier things, but I digress from the point being to biologize the undertaking, get a mushroom in there as well. Oh crap there's more writing I need to do, isn't there..

As I make my way through this small thread I'm exactly not sure what to make of this substance.  Has anyone been experimenting with it lately, if so how does it stack up against 3-meo-pcp and 3-meo-pce?  Is it worth the investment?

It's crazy how much potency changes between batches. I've been doing this frequently for 2 years now. First times my doses were 20-25mg. Then next batch it went up to max 18mg. Now the last batch I got, I dosed 15mg and didn't remember at least one hour of the trip. It was too much.

Regarding potency/price I think it is definitely worth the investment. 40€ = 70-80 doses, I think it's a steal and also it's one of the best dissociatives ime

I've been wanting to try this for a while now, but I haven't been able to fully decide between 3-ho-pcp, 3-meo-pcp, or o-pce. So far I've been leaning more towards 3-ho-pcp though. The only dissociatives I've tried before are Ketamine, DXM and MXE so I'm pretty curious to find out how it compares to those.

I have tried this one before, as I did 3-MeO-PCP, 3-MeO-PCE, 2'-OxO-PCE, DCK, MXE and diphenidine, and it's alway been very well received here!


I did come across a batch that seemed impure about a year ago, but it was still comparable to the rest of the class' most potent chems. I loved it's effects very much! Not really suited for holing/heavy experiences but definitely a fun and well rounded dissociative!


I'm currently expecting this to land once more, along with samples of MXPr, MXiPr and O-PCE. Will definitely report back about the current European batches and the new dissociatives as best as I can.

Alright, I've finally decided to just go ahead and try 3-ho-pcp. I already found a vendor with really good prices so as soon as I have enough money I'll order some.

I have to report I've stumbled upon a reason why indefinite daily use is not a good idea.


Surprisingly it's not life spiraling out of control, in the end I've been managing to use without breaking stuff.. even coming back to reality having fixed stuff without remembering, like having given yourself a little gift, suddenly a functional coffee grinder you haven't recollected heh. It also wasn't about tolerance, weirdly enough. The 20mg+10mg daily dosing hit harder after a break, but it kept feeling pleasurable until body and brain felt depleted and an off-day or two was called for. Even the kidney load was negligible. You could feel it if an effect took you by surprise after scale jank, or simply because of a too immersive flow state. But generally, if I structured the dosing ritual in such way as to always have a pint or two of tea going with it, it would go unnoticed. It's especially insignificant compared to a daily ketamine regime (at the "penalty" of having to combo micro- to low dose LSD to get functional clarity out of it).


No, the real drawback wasn't in tolerance, even though the comedown would tend to come sooner. Which is to say, the sound of neurons forcibly firing would still be there, only not coinciding with euphoria anymore. This much I had reported before, only I suddenly noticed that this substance-induced tinnitus-esque effect still was there the morning after. So I've laid off the 3-HO-PCP since in response to this alarming threat to quality of life.. and I suppose it's slowly fading away? It's tricky paying attention to the absence of perfect silence, as there's never been such thing as perfect silence to begin with, as one can confirm in early phase meditation practice. In other words, how to distinguish between tinnitus and a heightened awareness of natural neuro-electrical static? I happen to be capable of hearing whether electrical devices are plugged in or not, and dissociatives have sharpened this remarkably useless superpower. So maybe the same is happening here, only now it's sensory awareness of bio-electricity?


Granted, I am talking about a weak effect. Normal room or outside ambiance masks it. I need to wear closed cans or earmuffs before I become conscious of the faint static. Or use cannabis, which regretfully amplifies it.. I don't like it when I can't use the herb as padding against disso drawbacks.. But I've stopped using the powder for a couple of days now, and I'm unable to tell whether the noise has ever so slightly diminished, or whether I'm just getting used to the new normal, which is still quite close to the previous normal save for meditating / toking up.


So we'll see what happens next. For reference, I've gone through 2 à 3 grams of 3-HO-PCP. I've little recollection of any timeline, but so this means I must have been freely using for at least two or three months now.. maybe up to double, considering I didn't mind spending the day-after stoned to replenish energy and nutrients.


Actual tinnitus is high-level torture. It can drive people to suicide. That's why I find the slightest hint of non-fleeting sonic shenanigans pretty portentous. So do beware.

I saw a big blimp like the Hindenburg when I was on an epic amount of 3-HO-PCP and hearing myself as a god.  I presented myself as a solar eclipse blimp in my bed.

A month into this semester I was looking for a reset. Obviously had caffeine (and nicotine) in my system which is never a good additive to the dissociative experience. All I had was 3-HO-PCP so I thought I'd try plugging it as I've only ever ate it or snorted it. Did 10mg and some balloons and then a 5mg redose with a large hit off my dab peb. This is the most challenging dissociative I've ever used. Comeup was super smooth and euphoric and then it just got really on edge all the sudden. Same thing happened a few months ago and it was a harrowing experience making me think I'd never use this stuff again.

This time I ended up taking some bromazolam which just made the anxiety worse (mu-opioid activity of 3-HO-PCP, anyone?). This stuff is just so unforgiving, I really never will take it again. Really made me realize how far off equilibrium the seemingly subtle stimulants are pushing me. Maybe complete absence of even caffeine and nicotine should be my ground state.


Edit: On the plateau this stuff feels so damn good but it's just so freaking potent. Ended up taking a few balloons down by the creek and ended the night on a great note. I guess 8mg oral is listed as a heavy dose on PW, so they're pretty accurate on this one. Gonna keep what I have but never going above 10mg again, it's just too much.

Disso head tendencies taking back over, so I'm hopefully hopping into this one for real this time soon. To me it sounds far too potent to not do volumetric dosing. But it sounds like the best thing available, and being so potent (and mu opioid agonist ![:p](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)) I think it's the best thing for me to hop on. If I don't get weird with it I should have plenty for awhile. The foreign PO fucking jacked me likely so now it'll be awhile till I can mess with it.


Anyone dissolve this stuff up? I'll look it up but hopefully it works fine in PG. It seems indeed that the consensus is that it is most righteous of what's on the market, albeit a little overpowered.


Gonna cross my fingers that I don't get carried away, but I've been good recently and my drug class of choice is calling my name again. Stimulants make me feel shitty. Can't fuck with dope again. Never gonna drink alcohol again. PCP analogues are just the perfect mix of bliss and comfort, I can't deny them. Just won't mix more than one for weeks on end this time. Dosed responsibly they have the best antidepressant effect that just cures all my ails. Ok fuck it I'm done dreaming about stupid drugs for the moment. But soon!

You sound a lot like myself. I had a long break from dissos and recently got a few different ones to replenish my collection. This is the only one I binged on till it was gone and then got more. 

At reasonable doses it’s very uplifting and pretty mild mentally. It seems to have fewer side effects than just about any other disso. I could dose this at 6:30 pm and be asleep by 11 pm. Then I’d wake up and go to the gym at 6 am. 

Eventually the side effects of using dissos to often did creep in. I started having memory and word recall problems. A feeling of being generally worn out and a short temper. Most of those side effects wear off after a few days of not having any. 

Right now this is my favorite disso and for that reason I’m having my gf hold on to it.

It's good your girl helps you out with that. The redosing over long periods of time tends to make me spiral out, and I last had a bad scene 4 months ago. Gonna try and be as cautious as I can. 


And you know, my timing was absolutely impeccable. I thought I had just lost out on an investment in this product and went ahead and found more elsewhere. 


I was pleasantly surprised this morning w/ a small amount of this. And due to my lack of faith, it looks like I'm gonna be stuck w/ this one for awhile. Haven't tried it yet, will update when I do.

I wanted to experience what a state of mania was like so over the course of a few hours I insufflated  ~50mg with minimal tolerance.


 CEV's very much like the ones I get from Ketamine, beautiful nature like but more chaotic with barbed like wire or thorns splashed throughout them.  After the doses began to compound on one another I felt extremely stimulated but not overly mentally intoxicated, but at the same time heavily dissociated in terms of coordination.


By the end of the night I was outside naked wandering around the yard (I live on a farm) my girlfriend was trying to get me back inside but I didn't want anything to do with it. It didn't make sense to me why it was an issue at all, I was warm so it made perfect sense. I wanted to run amongst the beasts of the night and hunt in the field. A friend was messaging me asking me to come hangout and I pictured myself walking to their apartment naked and how hilarious it would be to run into people. I didn't do this and went back inside and just paced around listening to music, it was odd because I wasn't satisfied with anything I would play. Eventually went to bed and woke up with a killer headache that lasted most of the day.


Overall a pleasant experience, I didn't have any grandiose thoughts or plans but I think I got what I wanted out of it and wouldn't do it again. 


I can totally see how and why people would get naked and wander around the streets getting themselves into all sorts of terrible predicaments.

50 mgs a big ass dose. I just recently bumped 7mg and that's been pleasant enough to keep me from screaming my way through this comedown.

Strong disso tolerance, opioid naive there.

First test 5mg plug, what a suprise, it's not at all manic like 3meoPCP, and for me it's even no dissociative.

Just like a opioid/stoning/calming feeling with long legs, almost medical à la 4meoPCP if you remember.

Sure its not a drug for me, but of all the stuff I have put in my but, this on is the one I would chose to tapper, leave, other drugs (disso, benzo, whatever ).

It is just so relaxing, just makes me feel dumb and somewhat content and last a long time, so I dont have to deal with the anxiety, craving of other stuff.

I'll just keep it as a healing stuff, and yes, it allow me to stop my habit for those holing dissos to, and its just better than benzo/GHB/etc to do that.

No desire to test heavyer dose.

so i was goin gto go with 3-cl-pcp and I wanted to, but was unable to.  this left with with 3-ho-pcp as my only choice. i am a bit nervous due to its potency, my propensity to psychosis, and my addictive personality, but for my first trial i will go out of town to try it with a limited amount to gauge how i react. i am planning to mostly use it in microdose or if i like it enough maybe as a festival drug. i am hoping i can get a nice euphoric functional disso out of this that wont be too compulsive, too manic, or lead to delusions (at least not the dangerous kind).

Please be very careful with your doses. Depending on your tolerance, 8-12 mg is plenty. I typically take 25-30 mg as I prefer more intense experiences, but I have an insanely high permatolerance to these compounds. Also be aware that the onset of effects is much slower (at least in my experience), even for intranasal administration (my preferred ROA for just about everything). Wheras 2'-Oxo-PCE hits within 2-3 minutes for me when I snort it, 3-HO-PCP can take up to 20-30 minutes before developing to full effect. Enjoy, and be safe...

Yeah I don't plan to go over 10mg, I more plan to mostly microdose it. How fiendish is it ? Equal or more or less than ketamine? I found mxe less fiendish than K.  Really hoping this goes well and I am not writing in a few weeks about the psych ward

I can't speak to the addictiveness of ketamine as I still have yet to try it, but for me 3-HO-PCP was less reinforcing than 3-MeO-PCP/3-MeO-PCE. It's still easy to abuse, though - all depends on the person using it. I still do not have nearly as much self-discipline as I'd like when it comes to any of the arylcyclohexylamines, but am better off than I was a few years ago. 


It seems to have slightly more physical side effects/body load than some other compounds in the series, but nothing terrible. It is by no means perfectly safe and harmless, but probably a hell of a lot easier on the system than swilling gallons upon gallons of hard liquor for decades... 


I would advise against redosing, especially at medium to high dosage levels. I haven't done any actual testing to verify the pharmacokinetics of 3-HO-PCP (or any other RC dissociative for that matter) but judging from subjective experience it seems to have a longer half-life and slower rate of elimination than other similar materials. Throwing mu-opioid receptors into the mix also adds an additional layer of complexity to the interactions between receptor systems in the brain. I made the mistake of going on a binge with this stuff a couple of years ago and it came back to bite me in the ass in a big way. Never experimented with microdosing it, so I can't say much about how that might go.

Personally I would say it´s the least functional of the 3-XX-pcX´s. Stay in microdosage zone and you will probably be OK (1-2mgs), going above that, even for a quite tolerant user, it gets difficult to relate to others and behave normal.

The golden one of the current available ones I would say it´s 3-meo-pce.


It produces a massive amount of energy, you better canalize it: dancing, doing a lond hike, bicycle, etc. Staying still in a place can get a bit overwhelming on 3-ho-pcp. Take it all with a grain of salt, as YMMV. In any case, you seem prudent and in mini/microdosage sizes it should all go nicely

Prudent until that first molecule hits my brain. And I doubt I will keep it "mostly" microdose but I'll do everything I can to avoid binges or psychosis

No, I don't mind at all. I ended up using 3-HO daily for a week-and-a-half. After about 8 days, I imagine it was starting to accumulate to dangerous levels, and by the tenth night I blacked out and came to a couple of hours later having had full-blown tonic-clonic convulsions (a grand mal seizure). Stayed off of it for the next several days, and then only used it 2-3 times per week from that point on - still too frequent for fully recreational doses, but at least I had improved somewhat. For safety's sake, daily use should be reserved for microdosing or low-dose type situations in my view.

I just got a batch of brown Crystaline 3-HO-PCP. How would one go about washing it? It feels dirty but I'd like to save what I can from this batch, but I don't want to ingest poison. I've never "washed a batch before but I would like to with this one. I'm curious as to the protocol

I assume an acetone wash would be the go-to.  Here is how to do that:


- Obtain some 99% anhydrous ACS reagent grade acetone from amazon or elsewhere.  If not anhydrous/ACS, at least find some 99% acetone.
- Obtain some epsom salts
- Whether you have anhydrous acetone or not, you still need to dehydrate it, as acetone gradually absorbs water from the air.  To do this, put a bunch of epsom salts on a piece of foil or something and bake it in the oven at low (~170 degrees F) for an hour or so to dry all of the water out of them.  Epsom salts also absorb water, so you will be using them to pull all of the water out of the acetone.  Even a miniscule amount of water in acetone can dissolve a lot of a drug, which you do not want
- As quickly as you can once the salts have cooled some, drop them into the acetone.  You want to overestimate as extra will only serve to make sure the acetone will stay dehydrated for longer.  Once they're in the acetone, put the cap/lid back up the container and shake it up and swirl it around for a bit.  This will cause the epsom salts to absorb whatever water is in the acetone.
- Once it's dehydrated, get a shot glass or glass flask or something, an empty collection glass, and filter paper, coffee filters work.  Weigh the drug to wash and put it in the glass.  Using a graduated cylinder or syringe, measure 30mL of dehydrated acetone per gram of substance, and put it in the glass over the substance.  Stir it around for a couple of minutes, let the substance settle to the bottom, and carefully pour off the liquid through the filter paper into the collection glass, keeping the undissolved solids and last bit of liquid in the original glass.
- Do another 15-20mL oer gram of fresh acetone, same procedure.  But this time, after you pour off the liquid layer, dump the solids with remaining liquid into the filter paper too.  Once it filters and you're left with "wet" solids in the filter paper, just pour another 5mL per gram through, to rinse whatever residue may remain
- Once the liquid is all drained, spread out the "wet" (I use quotes because no water is involved but it will be wet with acetone) clumps out ion the filter paper into a thin layer, and dry.  It will speed things along greatly if you blow a fan gently over the surface.  This will reduce drying time from ~24 hours to just maybe 8 hours.  Acetone is not very volatile so it takes a while to evaporate.
- Voila, you have a cleaned drug.  It won't handle every impurity, but it's pretty damn effective, especially in removing non-psychoactive impurities and remaining solvent contamination.

I have gotten two different varieties in the past, both (purportedly) synthesized in Europe. About 75 percent of the orders that I've gotten have been almost pure white powder, visually damn near indistinguishable from 3-MeO-PCP/PCE HCl. The other 25 percent have been a mixture of off-white powder with brownish chunks/flakes. Not sure, but probably impurities of some sort. Go with what Xorkoth said first and foremost, but if you have access to more advanced chemistry resources, then several steps utilizing vacuum filtration with intermediate to final recrystallization using methylene chloride (also known as dichloromethane/CCl2 - available in most hardware stores but would need to be purified and dried using similar methods to what has already been discussed) or alternatively, freebase and recrystallize using ACS reagent grade anhydrous diethyl ether or Tetrahydrofuran (THF). The 3-HO-Phencyclidine can handle acetone just fine, it only depends on the solubility/miscibility of whatever impurities might be present as far as the success/partial failure of the final procedure. 


If anyone wants more detail on this feel free to PM me and we can go over details. 


Take care everyone, and be safe!

Oh something to add, also cover the epsom salts with foil when you bake them, as they can sort of pop when the water inside heats and expands, which can cause epsom salt particles to spread all over your oven.

It very well may be psychosomatic. I just felt a few tinges of pain internally here and there throughout the night. Other than that I tasted metal in my mouth all night. The only other drug that has given me that effect is Zopiclone. Other white batches of 3-HO that I've had in the past haven't produced a metallic taste in my mouth.

It may or may not be psychosomatic since this is the only brown, crystaline batch that I've had

got half a gram of this in small light brown crystals. appearance was similar to rocks of 2F-DCK or 3-Cl-PCP but smaller and tinted brown. 


With crushing and heating was able to dissolve the 0.5 g into 30 mL of propylene glycol. 


took 0.5 mL orally on an empty stomach and redosed same amount an hour later. 

effects seemed to plateau around 45 min. really enjoyed this one. warm, calm, positive. gave me a lot of what I like about MXE. 

repeatedly vaped DMT from a ccell cartridge during the peak. removed anxiety from the DMT experience but didn't seem to synergize as well as ketamine does. when vaping DMT on K i have had more immersive HD/video CEVs but with 3-HO-PCP the effect seemed less deep. only one experience so far tho, so hard to say. 


initial impression was that its a relatively functional ACH. That is to say it is probably not great for people who want to hole, but probably a good adjunct for psychedelics. Definitely produced a very good afterglow: a feeling of positivity and relief from depression without the burned over stimulating feeling that 3-Cl-PCP produced for me. and as others have noted the effects resolved quickly. had a bit of euphoria on the come up and it left me with a content, happy, motivated feeling. not truly sober at +5 hr but close. not feeling foggy or having slow reactions, but having trouble with word finding and having dyslexic-like issues with reading. yet did feel motivated and capable of chatting with friends and family and cognitively intact enough to perform well in a trading card game. 


Good stuff. hope to source more. could be a function of my disgusting tolerance (16 mg - if I measured right - wasn't that intense for me), but found the effects profile very useful and directly comparable to low/mid dose mxe. the after glow is potentially better (clearer / more humane) but seems to be pretty short lived.

Just had my first experience with this. I haven't used a disso recreationally in a few years. Ketamine infusions every few months but otherwise nothing. I insufflated 7mg 3-ho-pcp and then 4mg more an hour later. At first I felt that warm opioid-like feeling, almost caught a nod while listening to some Son Lux. It gave way to a clean, light, and airy dissociation. Felt very in synch with the universe, just flowing along its numerous tendrils. I smoked ~12mg o-pce on top of it at several intervals while watching adventure time. It sent me into the purest hole I've ever experienced and the warmth of the 3-ho-pcp was able to balance out the o-pce's coldness. I am now lying in bed roughly five hours out from the last dose of 3-ho-pcp, maybe two hours from the o-pce. I still feel an incredible warmth but the lingering dissociation from the o-pce is not entirely pleasant. Next time I'll let the 3-ho-pcp do its thing on its own. While it is fun to occasionally bludgeon myself out of existence I am looking forward to a gentler 3-ho-pcp experience the next time I indulge. Very positive first impression, I'm looking forward to my next experience with this.

Nice, yeah I really like 3-HO-PCP, it is so much warmer and nicer than 3-MeO-PCP, which is quite manic and weird, even insidious.

I feel the same way. I think if it was a gram of 3-ho-pcp, and not a gram of 3-meo-pcp that had fallen into my lap a few weeks back, I'm not sure it would have ended quite as crazily.


Although, don't get me wrong, I have definitely had some moments with 3-ho-pcp, mostly back in '20. I loved that stuff. 


Man I had like 5 grams of it, that I went through over time, with a wee bit of help from friends and such. But damn, it was just chunky tan crystals. I loved that stuff. I called that bag my "Big Rock Candy Mountain". 


Just delicious and warm, beautiful stuff.


But, I think it needs to start sticking in my brain that I simply shouldn't fuck with dissociatives anymore. Maybe just the PCP ones anyway. But me being a broke joker, those are really the only ones I can afford, which is a bit of a bummer.


I loved DMXE though, if I had that around I probably wouldn't be concerned about the PCP chems at all. 


But, honestly, yeah, I just think I need to stick to standard psychedelics for a little while. Had a great LSD experience the other day on one tab, probably going to take two next time I do it. 


Unfortunately I lost all of my drugs when I flushed everything at the hotel two weeks ago, except for the LSD. This unfortunately included my DOC, which I fucking loved to death. Honestly I had done a lot of the DOC already so I don't think I lost a whole bunch. Honestly don't even remember what was all included in the shit that got flushed. I think it was mostly just the 3meopcp, cyclazodone (which honestly I probably needed to take a break on for my livers sake), and the DOC. Everything else I had already done basically.

Absolutely. My last tangle with 3-meo-pcp ended in a pretty nasty bout of psychosis. It has a certain darkness to it, insidious is a good word to describe it. I'm sure if I dosed 3-ho-pcp regularly for long enough it might take on some of the same qualities but 3-meo-pcp feels like it's grabbed control of your brain from the first dose. Appreciate the welcome, I've lurked for almost a decade and figured it was time to make an account.

Dissociatives can be very dangerous drugs, much moreso than psychedelics.  The effects they can have on behavior are extremely profound, especially for some people.  And generally the people who love them the most seem to be the most prone to getting into really bad situations with them, too.  I like them but don't love them... I have never gotten into any bad situations on them (I have gotten way too high and been unable to care for myself but fortunately I had friends with me).  I think some people are better off without them, unfortunately.  It's good to recognize that anyway.


PCP and PCP based chemicals do seem to be the worst offenders.

It is so interesting the different ways people respond to dissociatives. For some they are so dangerous...


I am not even sure I enjoy the state they provide. Everytime I take them I am left wondering if I am actually enjoying the experience. However the afterglow is where the magic is for myself, I am left in a positive, motivated state for a long period after a dose. Such strange creatures those disso's!

On ones like DCK and O-PCE that have a longer dissociated tail I generally feel uncomfortable and regretful when I've redosed. PCP analogs, however, tend to feel better with each redose. This makes them a little more dangerous to me as the tendency is to push them as far as they will go.

I agree completely, redosing makes the high more fun but it's a fine line between getting a good buzz and going into a weird blackout.

I feel the same way, except I sometimes really enjoy them a lot, and sometimes find them oppressive and uncomfortable.  The exception was MXE, 99% of the time I had an amazing time on it.  A couple of times it was very uncomfortable and weird.

Totally agree with the sentiment about dissociatives being dangerous and that some people are better off without them - that latter fact might well apply to me - but speaking as someone who loves dissociatives a lot but has avoided getting into any truly bad situations with them, and the vast majority of the time have done them alone, including an accidentally large dose of a PCP analogue on a few occasions, I'm gonna share some hints for those who do get themselves into trouble (this is kinda tongue in cheek, I realise I've just been lucky, substances that are profoundly altering, induce delusions of sobriety, and honestly are sometimes just fucking terrifying are obviously gonna be disastrous at least some fraction of the time for many people - so I intend this as a joke). ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


Firstly... if you start thinking that you've been plucked into a different reality by some beings of unknown intention and purpose - you start thinking you have superpowers - you start believing yourself to have been taken over by some kind of weird demonic entity that now just has your normal cognitive processes encased in a little box inside your mind while it operates your body (talking about that lil 3-MeO-PCP demon if anyone can relate) - basically... if you are just not sure what's going on - or even if you are *absolutely* sure what's going on and it's such a revelation that it's going to change the world - any of these scenarios or anything similar... don't do anything about it right away.


Just. Sit. Quietly. (Or stand, whatever, whatever you happen to be doing). If you don't know where you are, for god's sake don't just start roaming around blindly. 


You're not gonna find your way out of another dimension on your own, wait for whoever or whatever brought you there to reveal themselves, You're not gonna gain anything from engaging in a frantic internal battle to regain control of your consciousness from an interdimensional invader, chances are it knows more about this world and about your mind than you do - be wary, just watch it - it might be just as baffled as you are. If you're the messiah, or the almighty god of all creation him/her/itself, there's no rush. In fact, you probably have all the time in the world, you've got some planning to do! If you're still incarnate in a human body, realise that body has limitations that you need to understand before you go reveal yourself to the world. Sleep on it, or just bask in the feeling - you have time. Whatever you do - DO NOT start trying to escape, fight, or save humanity right away. Be patient. If you're not alone, and can understand language, just be still. You owe it to the mortals to break the news to them as gently as you can. Let them sleep on it. Let that demon poke around in your head for a bit, most of the time it'll figure out how to get out on it's own.

Totally identify with this, although for me the afterglow is a bit unreliable. It might be because my preference is for the sedating, smash reality sideways types, ~PCMs, ketamine obviously, higher dose MXE and analogues which typically include a few redoses which are probably frazzling my brain cumulatively with each dose which might have something to do with it. The stimulating weirder ones like the ~PCPs and ~PCEs I redose a lot less often because there'll be a point where the weirdness is most definitely no longer fun - but these tend to have more lucid, happy afterglows.


As far as "wondering if I'm actually enjoying the experience", yeah, I feel you there for sure, especially with ketamine which remains an occasional if progressively more controlled vice in my life that I wonder why I'm doing it half the time I do do it. I rarely actually hole anymore, partly due to tolerance and partly because my girlfriend (who I don't use around at all, we have an agreement about it of a sort I don't want to just push it in her face) is not the biggest fan of speaking to me when I've overshot the dose to the point where communication becomes a bit difficult. And, honestly, overshooting the dose on any disso can be scarier to a drug naive observer than it is to the actual drug user, who may well be having a great time, so I do get that. But yeah, I used to just zone out and watch TV shows but the character of the experience has changed somewhat, I know I'm not getting any secrets of the universe out of it after all, I know I'm probably gonna redose a few more times than planned and feel fucked up and scattered for a few days after, the experience itself is nice but... is it even that nice anymore? But still every few months or so I just get this inexplicable impulse like yeah... you know what I haven't done in a while, that drug I really love, and always have a great, relaxing time on, like nothing else... Imma get myself some ketamine (or maybe something more exotic even more rarely just to mix it up a bit). ![:ROFLMAO:](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f923.png) Dissos are strange ones indeed.

Just did a risky experiment. For those unaware, I ruined my ears through binging this stuff, resulting in about a year and half of tinnitus torture. I've only recently mostly recovered.


I reckoned I should be able to block the ototoxic effects if combining with Naltrexone (2/3 a common dose, I'd have to decipher the Russian on the package again in order to state how much that is). Also preloaded with magnesium l-threonate, NAC and EGCG.


I plugged about 8mg 3-HO-PCP (not much on the NMDAR front, tolerance has risen rapidly over a couple days of dissociative use). Indeed no ear pain, but the k-opioid blocking is not 100%, I can feel some pressure in the left ear and will not be repeating the experiment. Notably no increase in tinnitus though. Some dissociation, legs feel pleasantly internally massaged.


Of course it defeats the purpose using an opioid dissociative with an opioid blocker, but I had the ingredients still lying around and figured the setup is a nice random scientific curiosity. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Okay, I got the suspicion the pressure sensation has been because of not the greatest care in spacing and ratio, because looking at the affinities Naltrexone really should sufficiently block the k-opioid receptor. I can spare a little more Naltrexone upon taking stock, so let's test that hypothesis, shall we. The day is stained with Naltrexone's noise profile anyway.


2/3rds Naltrexone now taken an hour prior, with the other 1/3rd half an hour prior. Roughly doubled the supplements as well, one half half an hour prior, other half at lift-off.


12mg 3-HO-PCP rectally. Some minor noise during come-up, no ear pressure. Noise profile not readily distinguishable from NAC's hiss, somewhat more tolerable than presumed serotonergic dissociatives like MXPr and MXiPr. I'd guess though partially blocked it's noisier than O-PCE, but I'd have to look into whether d-opioid reception is relevant to ear function or whether other mechanisms are at play. The effect definitely still is sedating and pleasurable, and I reckon a little kratom cousin won't hurt.


Edit to follow up that the ear was indeed perfectly protected during this trial. Which is to say I did indeed redose 12mg on the tea.


The behaviour though was unacceptable, the kratom-ish hole made a mess of the place with objects almost lost and local social structures disrespected. Opioid dissociatives are not for me in case I didn't already gathered that from the ear terror it has already given me before, almost ruining my sanity with this crap. ![o_O](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f635.png)

Pre-loading with Ginkgo Biloba seems to mitigate KOR-fuckery with this one, which is relevant to harm reduction.


It might mess with its dopiness though, I'm not sure.


The stacking formula could turn it into a less 'sheep' of an effect, protecting the ear yet allowing the dissociation?


Edit: It shouldn't really scrap the dopiness looking at the relevant receptor sites, but I do feel it does. Replication by another volunteer would be interesting. I like turning 3-HO-PCP into a more energizing dissociative, with less tinnitus tones generated.


![ginkgo.png](https://www.bluelight.org/community/proxy.php?image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.postimg.cc%2Fgj82WbgX%2Fginkgo.png&hash=c1aaf17e3dd1c8af42d254c4e6a91223)


Plenty of other good reasons apparently for supplementing with Ginkgo Biloba (containing Amentoflavone) on top!


From skimming the research papers, on the KOR front it's [Ki = 140 nM] for 3-HO-PCP, versus [Ke = 490 nM] (is Ke a thing?.. or just a typo in the paper?). So Ginkgo is the underdog (in affinity land: less is more), but it's within the same order of magnitude, so if dosed copiously an hour in advance it should indeed very much make a difference here. As my experience seems to verify.


It has a measurable effect on videogames as well, it's a really drippy of an effect, really weird. Interesting, but not really nice. Oh well, one way to use 3-HO-PCP and not being shot to the frikkin' moon.

Sounds about right - these pcp drugs can really make me think some crazy shit as well. 3-HO-PCP seems a bit peculiar in how 'sober' I still feel, yet I'm actually high as fuck thinking insane shit.


I won't take this drug again - I went through about 60mg in two days recently, and do not like the after effects. Very irritable, low feeling - grumpy as hell, and some weird muscle spasms. 


I was taking a lot of St. John's Wort recently, so perhaps that's why I went through it so quickly. 


Fun fact, St. John's wort is a great way to speed up elimination of dissociative from the body, if you're in a pinch or are trying to detox after a binge. Works for Kratom and some other drugs as well. 


But yeah, no more 3-ho-pcp for me. Such a creeper, too - seems to take 2-3 hours to really kick in. So weird.

3-ho-pcp is a treacherous substance. I used it always Iv´d. The first times were great, very K-like. But soon I started loosing that feeling and always had a sense of being normal, not high, but I would fall for no reason and not put my hands to stop the fall. This happened to me several times until the last one 3 month ago, I hit my heaad hard in the front and back, blood everywhere, and couldnt understand what was  happening, trying to wash the floor while still dripping red. 

A couple of months later I started having the wors neck pain and muscle spasms, they thought it was a cervical rectification, but actually it whas a neck injury, kinda like a whiplash. I´m in the most pain now, gathering data so i can have a surgery and have a couple of discs removed and changed for metalic ones. I´ll never touch this chem again.

What’s the dosing like with this one (oral) for a first time dose with no disso tolerance at the moment?

I’m looking for something in the ballpark of 10mg 3-meo-pce.

You'll look at a lot of things saying anything over 10mg is massive dose, and each mg makes a big difference.


I've done a lot of this stuff over the years, and found that it's more tricky than that. Thing is, it's such a clear headed dissociative, that it's hard to ever really feel like you've had 'enough' or are 'high' as the illusion of sobriety is strong. 


I would suggest starting with 5mg, and redosing 5mg every hour or two after that.

It is a bit more potent than 3-MeO-PCE but not by much. I imagine 8-10mg 3-HO-PCP would feel about equal to 10mg 3-MeO-PCE.


Orally I start to feel first alerts around 30 minutes that slowly build until about the 90 minute mark when it starts entering the peak. I'd usually insufflate it because I'm impatient and 3-HO-PCP hits the sinuses like air, but I'm trying to be better about sticking with oral dosing

Can relate to the wintergreen. 3-HO-PCP, at least the recent batches I have gotten have a unique smell when I snort it. A fairly pleasant smell imo

had a rather novel odd experience on 3-HO-PCP that seemed worth posting about, since it's not something I had previously encountered on any dissociative (having tried quite a few)


I had a nice weekend afternoon of playing chill videogames and watching twitch streams. I had separate 10mg doses of 3-HO-PCP at 09:00, 13:00, 15:00, and 17:00. 10mg is my standard dose, though that many in short succession is on the higher end for me--I am a chronic regular user, but 4h between doses is my more typical minimum. I had also consumed about one 4% ABV beer an hour since 15:00, with a high alcohol tolerance, so medium buzzed or whatever


anyway, as luck would have it, the twitch stream I was watching was playing some early 2000s game where I guess devs hadn't really latched onto the whole "avoid epilepsy trigger lighting" thing yet, and there was some sequence with a series of regular, rapidly flashing hard red lights around 21:00. several minutes into this I noticed a feeling of being somehow transfixed by the lights while also feeling extremely confused and unpleasant, like my brain was shutting off and no longer able to process stimuli in a way that made normal sense. fortunately some more lucid part of my brain kicked in and said "hey, you are experiencing unusual confusion while looking at rapidly flashing red lights, this is classic photosensitive seizure shit, turn it off". I did so, turned off other lighting, and closed my eyes for a bit, and felt markedly better after ~10m.


I did notice an unusual after-effect where I had drastically-reduced night vision: I live in an area with a lot of light pollution, so usually even with all of the lights off in my apartment I can still see my way around from outside lights coming in through the windows. after this everything looked almost pitch-black despite the same levels of ambient outdoor light leaking into my apartment. my normal level of night vision returned after ~30m


AFAIK I have no family history of epilepsy (though we do have some history of bipolar disorder and ADHD), and I myself have previously seen stereotypical "likely to trigger photosensitive seizure" imagery before without issues. I suspect screwing with NMDARs hardcore in combination with GABAergics likely isn't going to do anything good for seizure threshold, but beyond that IDK. very bizarre experience overall.

Does it work like that below disociative dose or only when reaching some woblines you get proper pain relief?

Oh, initially, it's like a slightly dissociative opioid (eg methadone/almost oxycodone). Above about 15mg IM, it all becomes a bit confusing. 20mg and you have no idea what happened over the last hour.

Useful, to a certain degree, as no tolerance develops to the opioid effect

I haven’t had the chance to try this pcp analogue yet, but just received a sample. I understand that there is some type of opioid action being exerted here, so would me being on a small dose of suboxone (2mg) interfere with its effects?

I haven't noticed a massive difference between my 3-ho-pcp experiences between when I used before I had gotten on Suboxone. I do imagine that it changes the character a little bit but not to a noticeable degree. You'lll still very much get the dissociative effect from it

I recall pharmacological studies disproving this, despite how commonly the 3HOs are claimed to have opioid activity.

Ah gotcha. I haven’t looked too much in depth on this one, but recall quite some time ago that it was being purported to have some action there. Gonna try out 10 mg insufflated. Let’s see how it unfolds. It is a lil late but I hear this one isn’t as stimmy as 3-meo, so hopefully I can sleep after 4 hours

Opiod activity or not, PCP analogues strongly potentate full agonists even when taken in sub treshold dose. Does it works other way around, so full dose of opiod interferes with normal dose of PCP analogues I have no idea.

I quite like this lil compound, much more so than the previous 3-meo-pcp batches I’ve received lately. There was a time when meo was warm and smooth, but recently it’s felt cold, clinical, and had a propensity to send me flying off the handle bars. However, 3-Ho has that smooth edge to it that I’ve been missing. May have to re up.

I prefer is to the recent batches of 3-meo that have been in circulation. 3-meo has a sharp edge to it. It can become over stimulating and uncomfortable if taken too much. 3-ho is more potent, but way more relaxing, warm, and I’d say more euphoric than even 3-meo. I have a gram of 3-ho out for delivery. Been on mail watch all damn day, always shows up late when he’s delivering my goodies.

Ok so I just tried to IV 10mg. It didn’t seem to readily dissolve in saline with a little heat. Upon cooling there was some precipitate left on the spoon. I felt some mild effects, but nothing too intense.

Did your 3-ho-pcp dissociate in  saline? My product has a slight tan hue to it. Upon applying heat  it didn’t seem to be soluble. When the solution cooled it seemed to precipitate out of the solution. Do I need to add some other solvent?

My experience with 3-meo is from more than five years ago but it still remains in my mind as a drug experience that surprised me. And wasn’t exactly pleasant either (unlike K almost every time) but was really worth experiencing.

Ive got a pretty bad perma tolerance also, but ive noticed with FXE if you take some weeks off it actually goes back to being stronger again. This actually led me to taking these massive doses at times thinking i would need more to push through and it was just complete overkill. 


One time i took 750mgs sublingually, which is batshit insane in retrospect after two weeks off and it fucked me up so bad. Still had a great time tho and the hole felt like eons, was heavily dissociated for like a good half a day after that one. Reason i did this is cuz 500mgs orally, taken twice in day was good but i didnt hole. 


Was doing it weekly at the time tho. So i figured since i did a gram that time id be good with that dose, well i was just wrecked and came out of the hole ass naked in the hotel room. Ive got this habit of taking off all my clothes when im totally blasted.

Yeah i would not recomend it at all i have a very high disso tolerance and i love going far on them. I can go through a gram or more easily of FXE in a day if im really going for it. Even for "light" trips im not dosing leas than 250mgs sublingually, usually takes me doing that twice for me to get a hole. And this is with a couple weeks off. People that have no disso tolerance can hole off 125mgs i hear

This is why I love 3-ho-pcp. Sniffed 20mg and am feeling great. Super functional, hypomanic, great antidepressant and anxiolytic. Gotta be careful of daily usage though, cause life on these 3-x-pcx compounds can get out of hand due to their subtlety. Best antidepressant ever but I know I shouldn’t be doing this all the time. 


But yeah I’m at a point where I can do a 200mg shot of fxe and it just doesn’t do much, so time for a break. I’ve been through so many grams this year. It’s especially taxing on the body if used IV/IM. I make sure to use a micron filter and take all the necessary precautions, but it still can’t be good to carry on like this. That being said, it’s not as hard on the organs as straight ket.

I have tried this compound a week ago in various doses with no tolerance and this is what I’ve got to say.


I’ve tried it orally because I bought it in the form of 2mg tablets. On the first day I’ve tried it in 4mg followed by 2mg two hours later and another 2mg in another two hours. On the second day Ive tried 8mg and eight hours later Ive had 10mg.


The “low” dose was extremely boring. Felt exactly like taking 50-70mg of memantine. Very cold and clinical dissociation. Zero stimulation, in fact it was somewhat sedating. No warmth or opioid action going on. Very sensitive to light. Had a hard time watching a TV show because it felt so damn bright. Effects wore off in 3 hours with no residual effects. I could most definitely sleep while the effects were peaking. This dose had no visual tracers or laggy vision. Visually, the environment looked a little liminal but nothing eye catching.


The 8mg dose was definitely better in terms of dissociation but still a little clinical and cold. No tracers or laggy vision. Mild body numbness, could still get an erection and feel down there. Presumably I already had tolerance from the day before, so this time things looked pretty normal and lacked the liminal space effect. Light sensitivity was very intense. Overall the experience was boring and the effects wore off in 3 hours with no residual effects.


The 10mg dose eight hours after the 8mg dose was were the fun began. This time the dissociation was warm and the effects were similar to a 3rd/4th plateau DXM trip minus the serotonergic aspect of DXM. I liked how the effects slowly built up over the course of an hour to reach the peak that lasted like an hour and a half. The numbness I experienced from this dose was extreme. I could barely feel anything physically. Light sensitivity was so extreme that I could barely see anything. Things were pretty much white. I was beginning to blend in with the environment aka become one with everything - I guess I nearly holed, but I tried my best to not hole because I was at a family dinner and yeah no one suspected a damn thing about me because I purposely portray myself as a weird person when sober, so people don’t see a difference when I’m on something lol. I would have definitely had some nice CEV during the peak but I could not allow myself to close my eyes and enjoy the show at the time. 

This dose was not stimulating at all. Effects wore off in 4 hours instead of 3. No laggy vision/tracers from this dose. There was zero mania. I was experiencing something that’s the opposite of mania because 3ho was sedating my mind. I usually get manic on DXM and my personality splits into objective (everything/God) and the subjective (me, mortal human), but absolutely nothing crazy happened with my mind on 3-ho.


I found this drug to be extremely addictive even though I was finding it boring. I would put it up there with meth. Can’t stop till I run out category. The next day after my big dose I felt an urge to be in the dissociative state and the only dissociative available to me was DXM. I took my usual 2nd plateau dose (225mg HBR) and it hit me as hard as before in terms of the dissociation, so 3-ho did not affect my DXM tolerance. However the DXM mania was completely gone. My mind was not racing and I wasn’t thinking anything crazy which was a bummer.


It’s been a few days and the urge to use dissociatives is gone. Going to take a two month break.

I personally find it more warmer and relaxing than 3-meo-pcp. There was a time in the beginning, when 3meo was awesome, but more recently the batches I got were more cold, clinical, and over stimulating. The last batch I got was about a year ago or so perhaps I need to try it again. I’m curious which analogues do you like?

I know the whole affinity for mu opiod receptor hasn’t quite been demonstrated at an acceptable level, but I did an mg of my suboxone and 18mg of 3-ho-pcp and my pupils are pinned as if I actually did opiates. I’ve been on subs for 4 years and it’s never exerted any effects that makes my pupils pinned. Hmmm…


I also seem to get more pain relief from this derivative as opposed to 3-meo.

I've recently posted my hospital trip report on this substance. Since I was very recklessly on a number of other substances at the time and had used 3-HO-PCP quite a number of times before I think it was the combo that caused me to have a seizure/blackout type hole effect where my body was thrashing around but my mind was not consious.


I was wondering if someone would be willing to add any advice on the type of overdoses that are commonly reported with this compound on it's own when the dose is too high, such as in the case of hospitalisations? Does this one have the similar type of issue that I presume maybe common with the original PCP? I'm thinking of the kind of symtoms one might have seen in that episode of Hamilton's Pharmacopia on 5-MeO-DMT (smoked toad venom) where the person needed to be resrained and could have easily drowned, choaked on vomit, or damaged teeth while rolling on the ground, thrashing around near water? I know in the follow up episode in season 3 that he mentioned that there was a number of reports of death by these type of issues mentioned above from toad venom when there had not been people present to restain someone.


I just want to be aware to help people in the future such as if I ever get to work in emergency harm reduction 1st aid again at any festivals and people accidently overdose on 3-HO-PCP or similar subs


P.S. The Hospital Trip Report I wrote is linked here if you want to read it. Please note Trigger Warning:

prior to this incident were you using a daily ,did you have a substantial disso tolerance? 20-30mg as an initial dose is quite high. I used 3-ho-pcp for more than half a year daily with no issue, however my girlfriend has had episodes where i needed to restrain her to prevent injuries. She doesn't really have a tolerance and I gave her 8-10mg. I told her it can take quite some time for effects to develop, but she got impatient and while I wasn't watching did my 12mg bump. She became completely belligerent, 

  catatonic (not responsive and flailing around). Also even though your THC intake was quite low, THC can exponentially increase the effects of dissos. I've experience some flip outs myself from this combination so i never consume THC while on dissos.

Took a 2 month break from dissos and placed an order for a g last week. Yesterday it was out for delivery along with some 6-apb hcl (although reports claim it could be 5-apb), Either way, I like both compounds.


 Anyways, I waited all day for my pack and the postman never came. This is the first time my postman missed a scheduled route and now it says it's available for pick up at the post office. I was pissed, as my post man usually comes around 3-5pm and i planned to use both compounds on my day off, now im concerned that ill go all the way to the post office, to be told it's out for delivery again or they lost it. 


Anyways, i'm always surprised at the lack of love this compound receives. I even prefer it to 3-meo-pcp/pce. IME i'm less prone to overdoing and having an episode than 3-meo-pcp. Since it's more subtle and less stimulating at reasonable doses, I can mix it with uppers without any compounding issues. I'm headed to the post office now, really hope they have it.

Love this one. Cheap and potent. 15mg fucks me up well enough that any motor function ceases to be a possibility. As an amusing Reddit post mentions, it really is the lazy version of 3-MeO-PCP. But that's fine by me, stimulation is not why I take dissos. I've successfully mixed it with 4 other dissos which produced a deep deep hole. Very nice synergy.

Hope more people get to experience this wonderful substance. Just don't abuse it ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Was it the first time u tried it? IME all dissos take multiple trials before you find ur golden zone and something clicks in ur brain. I've had over a decade experimenting with 3-meo-pcp. back then the badges were completely different than the ones I've tried in the last two years or so. instead of warmth, hypomania, and euphoria, it feels cold and clinical whereas 3-HO is an amazing pain reliever, anxiolytic, and depression mitigator.

Seems I got pca instead of 3meo-pcp. There wasn’t any of the typical 3ho mixed nmda/opioid high that I was expecting. So pca is rather dirty compared to the other arylcyclohexylamines…

Every single seizure that I've ever had was caused by an overdose of PCP analogues. Strangely enough, I live in one of the two places in the USA where PCP is wildly popular and widely available. I've done a lot of PCP, never had a seizure. Sure some mania here and some psychosis there, but no seizures. But over the years, PCP analogues have given me at least 8 or 9 seizures. Or maybe I'm actually just incredibly messed up and I fall into a state that strongly resembles a seizure. I have woken up in the hospital after misadventures with PCP analogues more times than I would like to admit.

How would you compare RC variants of PCP to unsubstituted PCP, does PCP from the street feel less toxic in any noticeable way?

It’s quite confounding to me that this beautiful compound is slept on and fails to get the recognition it deserves. I have an extensive history with these drugs and tried almost every disso out there. Especially when it comes to the 3-x-x compounds, this one exceeds all others by a large margin ime. Granted there are many bad batches in circulation, so perhaps that has something to do with it.


I’ve had 3 months clean from all drugs and decided to revisit 3-ho once more. Currently

i’m in the midst of severe benzo WDs. Ended up doing a 2 1/2 month taper and have been completely off for almost 3 weeks. I’m still struggling with a lot of related symptoms such as anxiety, depression, body aches, compromised cognition etc. My source only has 20g left of his OG 3-ho-pcp, so decided to order a gram.


everyone obviously reacts differently to certain compounds, but for me 3-ho-pcp is one of my top drugs, the holy grail if you will. It’s as if it hits up every necessary receptor site in just the right way, producing anxiolytic, anti depression, pain relief, energy, fluid thought processes etc.


The first few times i wasn’t a fan, but like most dissos it takes time for it to click. 1 gram will last me a decent amount of time due to its potent dosages, especially if used therapeutically. Albeit, he increased the price by double since the supply is dwindling. Nonetheless it’s worth it. I was torn between this and DCK. Seeing as how i wanted something more functional, I opted for the former. 


Can’t wait to try this out again.

I'll have some 3-ho-pcp here soon from the same vendor. Had the same dilemma. Was torn between DCK and 3-HO-PCP. would love DMXE but its hard to justify it considering the cost/dose ratio. I had one batch of DCK before and remember it being pretty darn wonky but also dysphoric. So I went with 3-HO-PCP because it's the most cost effective, even at double the price.


I'm usually in the "3-HO-PCP is boring and bland" camp. Out of all the RC dissos its one of my least favorite, but I keep coming back.


This weekend my friend came over and we bumped some 3-HO-PCP and later on took 15mg of 4-HO-MET and continued bumping 3-HO-PCP. It was pretty intense initially but we had a great time. Tons of laughs. We watched How's Moving Castle and Princess Mononoke. Was a beautiful trip and I haven't had an afterglow like this in a while. My friend also says he has a great afterglow as well. I look forward to trying this in more combinations.


I did one time dose DMXE/4-HO-MIPT/4-HO-MET/3-HO-PCP/4-ACO-DMT and had a very intense but thoroughly enjoyable trip. I dont remember the dosages but they were pretty low, not counting the dissociatives.

It’s definitely not going to launch you to different realms, but I rather enjoy its subtle nature. I’m really obtaining it for it’s therapeutic effects as opposed to something that will get me obliterated. Not to digress, but I’m currently living at an SLE so I can’t go too hard. I ended up goin to rehab for a couple months and now i’ve been at this SLE for 3 weeks. I’m really doing this to get off of a horrible benzo habit and this far i’ve been doing well.


Anyways, I’ve actually grown quite fond of it over the past few years and for me personally it’s def in my top 5 dissos. 3-meo-pcp is too stimulating and prone to putting me into some uncomfortable places. I’ve seen some people label it as bland and boring, but I think it meets every criteria i’m looking for in a drug. There’s a warmth I don’t achieve with other 3-x-pcp/e compounds and it’s accompanied with a perfect amount of mania. Furthermore, it combines well with many types of drugs.


Even though the price went up, it still has a better cost/dose ratio then other dissos. Wish i had the money to get different ones, but im in a rough spot right now. Really want to get some 4-ho-met/mipt.

I've only ever administered 3-HO-PCP orally, has anybody here experienced with vaping, insufflation, or sublingual applications? If so, how would you compare them to oral administration? 


Also, what's the smallest interval of dose you'd use? I was initially using 2mg gel tabs but I feel like 2-4mg isn't that noticeable for me, while it is for many others.

Just tried 3ho-pcp for the First time, didnt expect much since i wasnt too impressed with the 3ho-pce. But  what happened was the most vile experience with any Research chemical that i ever took, absolutely disguisting. I felt totally poisoned for hours and was really relieved when it stopped. Cannot understand what people find in this chemical.

Crazy my dude I've done a few grams of 3 ho PCP and only had like one difficult experience lol. It's the best dissociative I've ever done best visuals of any drug and the high is amazing. I can't wait to get more.

I've done a lot of PCP, never had a seizure. Sure some mania here and some psychosis there, but no seizures. But over the years, PCP analogues have given me at least 8 or 9 seizures. Or maybe I'm actually just incredibly messed up and I fall into a state that strongly resembles a seizure. I have woken up in the hospital after misadventures with PCP analogues more times than I would like to admit.

What was the appearance? I've had a simialr experience one with a brown rocky crystalline batch.

Everytime I took it I'd get dissociated but felt poisoned. Like something wasn't right. Never have taken anything that felt so toxic. After 2 attempts I flushed it. I've gone through grams of 3-HO-PCP before and that one batch is the only time I've had that happen. Just was a poor synth with toxic byproducts left in it. Any time that I've had a white/tan powdery batch it has been fine. I enjoy it but I do feel it's one of the least interesting dissociatives that I've tried

Could have easily been a black out. Happened to me once. Was already on a pretty high dose and took a bump. Next thing I know I wake up and each of my limbs are tied to a hospital bed and I couldn't move. Turns out I blacked out and my roommate didn't know what I was on and decided to call 911

Same material i think. I was also thinking this was some different stuff other than 3ho-pcp because it felt clearly too toxic for something that is sold by a rc Company.

Wild man, I've gone through maybe a gram and a half at most over like a year (usually mixing it with psychedelics and empathogens) and I've found it to be one of the most consistently magical feeling substances I've ever come across. I've had others use it though and immediately think it's some sort of poison for some reason.

If it is the same batch that I had then there was something off about it. I've had bad reactions to drugs before but that was the only thing I've taken that felt like literal poison. The fact that the poisoned feeling was reproduced the 2nd time I took it tells me there was something toxic in it, especially considering my friend had the same reaction. Also the only time I've flushed something due to it feeling unsafe. Clean 3-HO-PCP is a worthwhile chem though. Sucks that you got a bad batch of it

What did it feel like? I’ve also had some experience with bad pcp that totally fucked me up… i drank gallon after gallon of whatever and felt completely out of it. It was not enjoyable at all, i felt posioned.
