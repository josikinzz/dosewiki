**4-Acetoxy-MET** (**4-Acetoxy-*****N*****-methyl-*****N*****-ethyltryptamine**, **metacetin** or **4-AcO-MET**) is a psychedelic tryptamine thought to be a serotonergic psychedelic similar to 4-AcO-DMT, LSD and DMT. Its molecular structure and pharmacological effects resemble those of the tryptamine psilocin which is the primary psychoactive chemical in magic mushrooms.

In terms of its chemistry, 4-AcO-MET is the acetate ester of 4-HO-MET. It is a substituted tryptamine with an acetoxy group at the 4 position of the cyclohexane ring, an ethyl chain and a methyl chain on the nitrogen position.

It is hypothesized that this compound is quickly hydrolyzed into the free phenolic 4-HO-MET, although human studies concerning the metabolic fate of this drug are lacking. This would explain a somewhat similar experience in their subjective effects. This is similar to how 4-AcO-DMT is thought to be deacetylated to 4-HO-DMT during first pass metabolism and subsequent passes through the liver.

In terms of its pharmacology, 4-AcO-MET’s psychedelic effects are believed to come from its efficacy at the 5-HT2A receptor as a partial agonist. However, the role of these interactions and how they result in the psychedelic experience continues to remain elusive.

4-AcO-MET is commonly sold as a research chemical through the use of online vendors. In terms of its effects, it can be vaguely described as somewhat more synthetic in feel to that of other tryptamines but with a shorter duration.

The effects listed below are based upon the [subjective effects index](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effects_index) and personal experiences of [PsychonautWiki](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) contributors. The listed effects will rarely if ever occur all at once but heavier dosages will increase the chances and are more likely to induce a full range of effects.

**Physical Effects:**

The physical effects of 4-AcO-MET can be broken down into three components all of which progressively intensify proportional to dosage. These are described below and generally include:

- [Spontaneous tactile sensations](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_effects:_Spontaneous_tactile_sensations) - The “body high” of 4-AcO-MET can be described as a pleasurable, warm, soft and all-encompassing tingling sensation. This maintains a consistent presence that steadily rises with the onset and hits its limit once the peak has been reached.
- [Sedation](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_effects:_Sedation) - In terms of its effects on the physical energy levels of the tripper, 4-AcO-MET is considered by most to be relaxing, stoning and mildly sedating. This sense of sedation is often accompanied by compulsive yawning.
- [Nausea](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_effects:_Nausea)

**Cognitive Effects:**

The cognitive effects of 4-AcO-MET are described by many as somewhat relaxing, yet face-paced in style with similarities to psychedelics such as LSD or 2C-B which tend to be cognitively energetic and stimulating. The drug contains a large number of typical and unique psychedelic cognitive effects.

The most prominent of these typical effects generally include:

- [Enhancement of current mind state](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_effects:_Enhancement_of_current_mind_state)
- [Connectivity of thought](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_effects:_Connectivity_of_thought)
- [Acceleration of thought](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_effects:_Acceleration_of_thought)
- [Feelings of fascination, importance and awe](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_effects:_Feelings_of_fascination,_importance_and_awe)
- [Time distortion](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_effects:_Time_distortion)
- [Outrospection](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_effects:_Outrospection)
- [Thought loops](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_effects:_Thought_loops)
- [Removal of cultural filter](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_effects:_Removal_of_cultural_filter)
- [Conceptual thinking](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_effects:_Conceptual_thinking)
- [Direct communication with the subconscious](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_effects:_Direct_communication_with_the_subconscious)
- [Ego suppression, loss and death](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_effects:_Ego_suppression,_loss_and_death)
- [Feelings of interdependent opposites](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_effects:_Feelings_of_interdependent_opposites)
- [Delusions](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_effects:_Delusions)
- [States of unity and interconnectedness](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_effects:_States_of_unity_and_interconnectedness)

**Visual effects:**

*Enhancements*

4-AcO-MET presents a full and complete array of possible visual enhancements which generally includes:

- **[Increased visual acuity](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Increased_visual_acuity)**
- **[Enhancement of colour](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Enhancement_of_colour)**
- **[Enhanced pattern recognition](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Enhanced_pattern_recognition)**

*Distortions*

As for visual distortions and alterations, the effects experienced are detailed below:

- [Drifting](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Drifting) *([Melting](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Drifting#Melting), [Flowing](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Drifting#Flowing), [Breathing](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Drifting#Breathing) and [morphing](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Drifting#morphing))* - In comparison to other psychedelics, this effect can be described as highly detailed, cartooon-like in style, slow and smooth in motion and static in appearance.
- [Tracers](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects_-_Psychedelics#Tracers)
- [After images](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects_-_Psychedelics#After_images)
- [Texture repetition](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects_-_Psychedelics#Symmetrical_texture_repetition)
- [Colour shifting](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects_-_Psychedelics#Colour_shifting)
- [Scenery slicing](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects_-_Psychedelics#Scenery_Slicing)

*Geometry*

The visual geometry that is present throughout this trip can be described as somewhat similar in appearance to that of Psilocin, 4-AcO-DMT and 4-HO-MiPT but with far stronger synthetic digital undertones reminiscent of LSD or 2C-B. 4-AcO-MET can be comprehensively described through its [variations](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Geometry#Variations) as intricate in complexity, abstract in form, equally synthetic and organic in style, structured in organization, extremely brightly lit and multicoloured in scheme, glossy in shading, sharp in edges, large in size, fast in speed, smooth in motion, angular in corners, unimmersive in depth and consistent in intensity. The visuals have a contradictory “natural” and “synthetic” feel to them which is reminiscent of both LSD and and Psilocybin. Higher dosages are significantly more likely to result in states of [Level 8A](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Level_8A) visual geometry over [Level 8B](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Level_8B).

*Hallucinatory States*

4-AcO-MET and its various other forms produce a full range of high level hallucinatory states in a fashion that is more consistent and reproducible than that of many other commonly used psychedelics. These effects generally include:

- [Transformations](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Transformations)
- [Internal hallucinations](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Internal_hallucinations) ([Autonomous entities](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Autonomous_entities), [Settings, sceneries, and landscapes](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Settings,_sceneries,_and_landscapes), [Alterations in perspective](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Alterations_in_perspective) and [Scenarios and plots](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Scenarios_and_plots)) - This effect is very consistent in dark environments at appropriately high dosages. They can be comprehensively described through their [variations](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Internal_hallucinations#Variations) as lucid in believability, interactive in style, new experiences in content, autonomous in controllability, geometry-based in style and almost exclusively of a religious, spiritual, mystical, science fiction or transcendental nature in overall theme.

**Auditory Effects:**

The auditory effects of 4-AcO-MET are common in their occurrence and exhibit a full range of effects which commonly include:

- **[Enhancements](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_effects:_Enhancements)**
- **[Distortions](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_effects:_Distortions)**
- **[Hallucinations](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_effects:_Hallucinations)**

**Physical Health Effects, Potential Addiction and Tolerance:**

The toxicity and long term health effects of recreational 4-AcO-MET use do not seem to have been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dosage is unknown. This is because 4-AcO-MET is a research chemical with very little history of human usage. Anecdotal evidence from people who have tried 4-AcO-MET within the psychonaut community suggests that there are no negative health effects attributed to simply trying this drug at low to moderate doses or using it very sparingly (but nothing can be completely guaranteed).

There is no current data for the LD50 of 4-AcO-MET, but it is thought to be high.

4-AcO-MET does not seem to be physically addictive and many users experience a self-regulating quality. There seems to be a tolerance build up when used consecutively multiple days in a row which requires one to double their dosage each time to achieve the same effects.

**Legal issues:**

**USA:** 4-Acetoxy-MET is unscheduled in the United States, but the possession and sale of 4-Acetoxy-MET could possibly be prosecuted under the Federal Analog Act if intent to consume can be proven because of its structural similarities to psilocin.

**Conclusion:**

4-AcO-MET induced a trip which was distinctively different from that of other more commonly used research chemicals that I have tried. The colourful, digital and synthetic geometry was in sharp contrast to that of 4-AcO-DMT, psilocybin and ayahuasca. This combined with its shorter duration and equally insightful headspace made for a therapeutic and recreational experience somewhat halfway between that of mushrooms and LSD.

**4-Acetoxy-N-methyl-N-ethyltryptamine** (also known as **4-AcO-MET** , **Metacetin** , and **Azomet** ) is a lesser-known novel [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) substance of [tryptamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tryptamine) class. Members of this group produce [psilocybin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocybin_mushroom) -like [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) effects when [administered](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Routes_of_administration) . It is structurally related to psychedelic tryptamines like [4-AcO-DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-AcO-DMT) , [4-AcO-DET](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-AcO-DET) , and [4-AcO-MiPT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-AcO-MiPT) .

The substance is closely related in structure to [4-HO-MET](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-HO-MET) , for which it is theorized to act as a [prodrug](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Prodrug) .

Very little data exists about the pharmacological properties, metabolism, and toxicity of 4-AcO-MET, and it has little history of human usage. It is sold as a [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) online. It is highly advised to use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Harm_reduction_practices) if using this substance.

## Chemistry

4-AcO-MET or 4-Acetoxy-N-methyl-N-ethyltryptamine is a synthetic indole alkaloid molecule of the [tryptamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tryptamine) class. Tryptamines share a core structure comprised of a bicyclic indole heterocycle attached at R 3 to an amino group via an ethyl side chain. 4-AcO-MET is substituted at R 4 of its indole heterocycle with an acetoxy (AcO) functional group CH 3 COO−. It also contains a methyl group and an ethyl chain bound to the terminal amine R N of its tryptamine backbone (MET). 4-AcO-MET is an acetate ester analog of [4-HO-MET](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-HO-MET) and the N-substituted ethyl homolog of [4-AcO-DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-AcO-DMT) .

## Pharmacology

It has been suggested that the substance is quickly hydrolyzed into the free phenolic 4-HO-MET by serum esterases, but human studies concerning the metabolic fate of this drug are lacking. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

4-AcO-MET's [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) effects are believed to come from its efficacy at the [5-HT2A receptor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin#The_5-HT_system) as a [partial agonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist#Agonists) . However, the role of these interactions and how they result in the [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) experience continues to remain elusive.

It is also hypothesized that this compound is quickly hydrolyzed into the free phenolic [4-HO-MET](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-HO-MET) , although human studies concerning the metabolic fate of this drug are lacking. This would explain a somewhat similar experience in their subjective effects. This is similar to how [4-AcO-DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-AcO-DMT) is thought to be deacetylated to [4-HO-DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-HO-DMT) during first pass metabolism and subsequent passes through the liver.

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation)** - 4-AcO-MET is considered by most to be relaxing, stoning and mildly sedating. Compulsive yawning often accompanies this sense of sedation. However, the sedation is often considered to be less strong than that of the related compounds [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) and [4-AcO-DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-AcO-DMT) .
- **[Spontaneous physical sensations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_physical_sensations)** - The "body high" of 4-AcO-MET can be described as a pleasurable, warm, soft and all-encompassing tingling sensation. This maintains a consistent presence that steadily rises with the onset and hits its limit once the peak has been reached.
- **[Changes in felt bodily form](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Changes_in_felt_bodily_form)** - This effect is often accompanied by a sense of warmth and usually occurs around or directly after the peak of the experience. Users can feel as if they are physically part of or conjoined with other objects in a seamless continuity. This is usually reported as feeling comfortable, tranquil and mindful, though it can also manifest in the form of bodily tension.
- **[Muscle contractions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_contractions)** - The muscle contractions that can occur by 4-AcO-MET tend to be transient and benign feeling in nature, compared to many other [tryptamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tryptamines) , [phenethylamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamines) and [lysergamides](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Lysergamides) .
- **[Muscle relaxation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_relaxation)**
- **[Excessive yawning](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Excessive_yawning)** - This effect seems to be uniquely pronounced among psilocin and related tryptamines. It can occur to a lesser degree on [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) and very rarely on psychedelic [phenethylamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamines) like [mescaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mescaline) . It typically occurs in conjunction with [watery eyes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Watery_eyes) .
- **[Watery eyes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Watery_eyes)**
- **[Olfactory hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Olfactory_hallucination)**
- **[Pupil dilation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pupil_dilation)**
- **[Runny nose](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Runny_nose)**
- **[Increased salivation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_salivation)**
- **[Teeth grinding](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Teeth_grinding)** - This component is considerably less intense when compared with substances like [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) when it occurs.
- **[Nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea)** ### Visual effects

#### Geometry
 
The visual geometry presented by 4-AcO-MET is similar in appearance to that of [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) , [4-AcO-DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-AcO-DMT) and [4-HO-MiPT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-HO-MiPT) but with stronger "synthetic" digital undertones comparable to [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) . 4-AcO-MET can be comprehensively described through its [variations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Geometry#Variations) as intricate in complexity, abstract in form, equally synthetic and organic in style, structured in organization, extremely brightly lit and multicolored in scheme, glossy in shading, sharp in edges, large in size, fast in speed, smooth in motion, angular in corners, non-immersive in depth and consistent in intensity. The visuals have a contradictory "synthetic" and "natural" feel to them which is reminiscent of both [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) and [psilocybin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocybin) respectively. Higher dosages are significantly more likely to result in states of [level 8A](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/8A_Geometry) visual geometry over [level 8B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/8B_Geometry) .
 
#### Hallucinatory states
 
4-AcO-MET and its various other forms produce a full range of high level hallucinatory states in a fashion that is more consistent and reproducible than that of many other commonly used [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) . These effects generally include:
 
- **[Transformations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Transformations)**
- **[Internal hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucination)** ( *[autonomous entities](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Autonomous_entities)* ; *[settings, sceneries, and landscapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Settings,_sceneries,_and_landscapes)* ; *[perspective hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perspective_hallucinations)* and *[scenarios and plots](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenarios_and_plots)* ) - This effect is very consistent in dark environments at appropriately high dosages. They can be comprehensively described through their [variations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucinations#Variations) as lucid in believability, interactive in style, new experiences in content, autonomous in controllability, [geometry](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Geometry) -based in style and almost exclusively of a personal, religious, spiritual, science-fiction, fantasy, surreal, nonsensical or transcendental nature in their overall theme. ### Cognitive effects
 
- The cognitive effects of 4-AcO-MET are described by much as somewhat relaxing, yet fast-paced in style with similarities to [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) such as [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) or [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) which tend to be cognitively energetic and stimulating.

## Toxicity and harm potential

The toxicity and long-term health effects of recreational 4-AcO-MET use do not seem to have been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dose is unknown. This is because 4-AcO-MET is a [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) with very little history of human usage.

Anecdotal evidence suggests that there are no negative health effects attributed to simply trying the drug by itself at low to moderate doses and using it very sparingly (but nothing can be completely guaranteed). [Independent research](https://www.google.com/) should always be done to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe before consumption.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this substance.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

4-AcO-MET is not habit-forming and the desire to use it can actually decrease with use. It is most often self-regulating.

Tolerance to the effects of 4-AcO-MET is built almost immediately after ingestion. After that, it takes about 3 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 7 days to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). 4-AcO-MET presents cross-tolerance with all [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) , meaning that after the consumption of 4-AcO-MET all psychedelics will have a reduced effect.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **[Lithium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_(medication))** - Lithium is commonly prescribed for the treatment of [bipolar disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder) . There is a large body of anecdotal evidence that suggests taking it with [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) significantly increases the risk of [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) and [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) . As a result, this combination is strictly discouraged.
- **[Cannabis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cannabis)** - Cannabis may have an unexpectedly strong and unpredictable synergy with the effects of 4-AcO-MET. Caution is advised with this combination as it can significantly increase the risk of adverse psychological reactions like [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) , and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) . Users are advised to start off with only a fraction of their normal cannabis dose and take long breaks between hits to avoid unintentional overdose.
- **[Stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants)** - Stimulants like [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) , [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) or [methylphenidate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylphenidate) affect many parts of the brain and alter [dopaminergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) function. This combination can increase the risk of [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) , and [thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops) . This interaction may also result in an elevated risk of [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) . [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol)** - Tramadol is well-documented to lower the seizure threshold and [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) may act to trigger seizures in susceptible individuals. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

## Legal status

- **Germany** : 4-AcO-MET is controlled under the NpSG ( *New Psychoactive Substances Act* ) as of July 18, 2019. Production and import with the aim to place it on the market, administration to another person, placing it on the market and trading is punishable. Possession is illegal but not punishable. The legislator considers it possible that orders of 4-AcO-MET are punishable as an incitement to place it on the market.
- **Switzerland** : 4-AcO-MET is a controlled substance specifically named under Verzeichnis E.
- **United Kingdom** : 4-AcO-MET is a Class A drug in the UK as it is an ester of the drug [4-HO-MET](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-HO-MET) , which is a Class A drug as a result of the tryptamine catch-all clause.
- **United States** : 4-AcO-MET is unscheduled in the United States. It may be considered an analogue of [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) ( *4-HO-DMT* ) which is a Schedule I drug under the Controlled Substances Act. As such, the sale for human consumption or the use for illicit non-medical or industrial intents and purposes could be prosecuted as crimes under the Federal Analogue Act.

4-AcO-MET, also known as 4-acetoxy-N-methyl-N-ethyltryptamine or metacetin, is a psychedelic drug of the tryptamine family. It is the acetate ester of 4-HO-MET, and a homologue of 4-AcO-DMT. It is a novel compound with very little history of human use. It is sometimes sold as a research chemical by online retailers.

## Use and effects

## Interactions

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

Due to its similarity to the psilocin prodrug 4-AcO-DMT, which is deacetylated to form psilocin in vivo, it is expected that 4-AcO-MET is also quickly hydrolyzed into 4-HO-MET by serum esterases, but human studies concerning the metabolic fate of this drug are lacking.
The pharmacology of 4-AcO-MET has been studied.

## Chemistry

### Analogues

Analogues of 4-AcO-MET include methylethyltryptamine (MET), 4-HO-MET (metocin), 5-MeO-MET, 4-AcO-DMT (psilacetin), 4-AcO-DET (ethacetin), and 4-AcO-MPT, among others.

## Society and culture

### Legal status

#### Switzerland

In Switzerland, 4-Acetoxy-MET is a controlled substance under Verzeichnis E.

#### United Kingdom

In the United Kingdom, 4-AcO-MET is a Class A drug in the United Kingdom because it is an ester of the drug 4-HO-MET, which is a Class A drug under the tryptamine catch-all clause.

#### United States

In the United States, 4-Acetoxy-MET is not scheduled. It may be considered an analogue of psilocin, a Schedule I drug under the Controlled Substances Act. As such, the sale for human consumption or the use for illicit non-medical purposes could be considered a crime under the Federal Analogue Act.
