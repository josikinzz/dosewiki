**2,5-Dimethoxy-4-ethylphenethylamine** (also known as **2C-E** , or colloquially as **"Aquarust"** and **"Eternity"** ) is a lesser-known [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) substance of the [phenethylamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamine) class. It is a member of the [2C-x family](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-x_family) of psychedelic phenethylamines, which are closely related to the classical psychedelic [mescaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mescaline) . Like other psychedelics, it is thought to produce its effects by binding to [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) [receptors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Receptors) in the brain, although the precise mechanism is poorly understood.

2C-E was first synthesized and tested for human activity by [Alexander Shulgin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alexander_Shulgin) in 1977, who documented his findings in the 1991 book [PiHKAL](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PiHKAL) ("Phenethylamines I Have Known and Loved"). It began to appear in drug seizures around 2004. While primarily distributed online as a [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) , it is also sometimes distributed on the street as 'mescaline' or 'synthetic mescaline'.

[Subjective effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effects) include [open and closed-eye visuals](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Geometry) , [time distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Time_distortion) , [enhanced introspection](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Introspection) , [ego loss](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ego_loss) , and [euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Euphoria) . User reports characterize 2C-E as a highly unpredictable, dose-sensitive psychedelic that is capable of producing strong visual distortions along with a significant "body load", which includes nausea and bodily discomfort.

Very little data exists about the pharmacological properties, metabolism, and toxicity of 2C-E, and it has a limited history of human use. Many reports indicate that the safe use of this substance may be overly difficult for those who are not already experienced with [hallucinogens](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hallucinogens) . It is highly advised to use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Harm_reduction_practices) if using this substance.

## History and culture

2C-E was first synthesized and tested for human activity by [Alexander Shulgin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alexander_Shulgin) in 1977, who documented his findings in the 1991 book [PiHKAL](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PiHKAL) ("Phenethylamines I Have Known and Loved"). It is a member of the so-called "magical half-dozen" which refers to Shulgin's self-rated most important [phenethylamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamines) -derived compounds, all of which except [mescaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mescaline) he developed and synthesized himself. They are found within the first book of [PiHKAL](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PiHKAL) , and are as follows: [Mescaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mescaline) , [DOM](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DOM) , [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) , 2C-E, [2C-T-2](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-T-2) and [2C-T-7](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-T-7) .

## Chemistry

2C-E or 2,5-dimethoxy-4-ethylphenethylamine is a [phenethylamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Substituted_phenethylamines) featuring a phenyl ring bound to an amino (NH 2 ) group through an ethyl chain. 2C-E contains methoxy functional groups CH 3 O- attached to carbons R 2 and R 5 and an ethyl chain bound to carbon R 4 of the phenyl ring. 2C-E belongs to the 2C family of phenethylamines which contain methoxy groups on the 2 and 5 positions of the benzene ring.

## Pharmacology

2C-E's [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) effects are believed to come from its efficacy at the [5-HT2A receptor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin#The_5-HT_system) as a [partial agonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist#Agonists) . However, the role of these interactions and how they result in the [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) experience remains the subject of ongoing scientific investigation.

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)** - 2C-E is usually considered to be very energetic and stimulating in a fashion that is comparable to that of [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) , although it is 'encouraged' instead of 'forced' according to many users.
- **[Spontaneous bodily sensations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_bodily_sensations)** - The "body high" of 2C-E is manifested as one of the most proportionally intense in comparison to almost all of the classical psychedelics. The sensation itself can be described as an intense and slightly uncomfortable energetic pins and needles sensation that constantly encompasses a person's entire body. It is usually felt over the surface of the skin but occasionally manifests itself in the form of a continuously shifting, tingling sensation that travels up and down the body in intermittent waves. This skin tingling is much more pronounced than with other psychedelics. Alongside this, many users report uncomfortable body feelings characterized by dysphoric aches and urges to shift the position of one's body and prolonged tensing of unusual combinations of muscle groups. 
- **[Physical euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria)** - Feelings of frequent but unpredictable rushes of warm physical euphoria are extremely common and very pleasurable. These move from the top of the head downwards before enveloping one's whole body.
- **[Tactile enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_enhancement)**
- **[Bodily control enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bodily_control_enhancement)**
- **[Temperature regulation suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Temperature_regulation_suppression)**
- **[Muscle contractions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_contractions)**
- **[Increased heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Increased blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Increased perspiration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_perspiration)**
- **[Nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea)** - Mild to extreme nausea is consistently reported when consumed in moderate to high doses and either passes once the user has vomited or gradually fades by itself as the peak sets in.
- **[Dehydration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dehydration)**
- **[Frequent urination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Frequent_urination)**
- **[Pupil dilation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pupil_dilation)**
- **[Teeth grinding](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Teeth_grinding)** - This component can be considered to be less intense when compared with that of entactogenic stimulants like [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) .
- **[Seizure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizure)** - This is a rarely observed effect but is believed to be a risk in those predisposed to them, especially while in physically taxing conditions such as being dehydrated, fatigued, undernourished, or overheated. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] ### Visual effects
 
- #### Enhancements
 
- **[Colour enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_enhancement)**
- **[Pattern recognition enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition_enhancement)**
- **[Visual acuity enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_acuity_enhancement)**
 
#### Distortions
 
- **[Drifting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting)** *( [melting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Melting) , [flowing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Flowing) , [breathing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Breathing) and [morphing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#_morphing) )* - In comparison to other psychedelics, this effect can be described as highly detailed, slow and smooth in motion, static in appearance and unrealistic/cartoon-like in style.
- **[After images](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/After_images)**
- **[Colour shifting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_shifting)**
- **[Scenery slicing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenery_slicing)**
- **[Symmetrical texture repetition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Symmetrical_texture_repetition)**
- **[Tracers](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tracers)**
 
#### Geometry
 
The visual geometry that is produced by this substance can be comprehensively described as structured in their organization, organic in geometric style, intricate in complexity, large in size, fast and smooth in motion, colorful in scheme, glossy in color, sharp in their edges and equally rounded and angular in their corners. It gives off a contradictory natural and synthetic feel that at higher dosages are significantly more likely to result in states of [Level 8B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Level_8B) visual geometry over [Level 8A](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Level_8A) .
 
#### Hallucinatory states
 
2C-E produces a full range of high-level hallucinatory states in a fashion that is more consistent and reproducible than that of many other commonly used psychedelics. This particularly holds true in comparison to other substances within the family of psychedelic phenethylamines. These effects include:
 
- **[Transformations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Transformations)**
- **[Machinescapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Machinescapes)**
- **[Internal hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucination)** ( *[settings, sceneries, and landscapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Settings,_sceneries,_and_landscapes)* ; *[perspective hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perspective_hallucinations)* and *[scenarios and plots](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenarios_and_plots)* ) - In comparison to other psychedelics such as [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) , 2C-E is extremely reliable at producing hallucinations embedded within visual [geometry](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Geometry) . This particular effect commonly contains hallucinations with scenarios, settings, and concepts. They are more likely to present themselves within dark environments and can be described as internal in their manifestation, lucid in believability, interactive in style and almost exclusively of a personal, religious, spiritual, science-fiction, fantasy, surreal, nonsensical or transcendental nature in their overall theme. ### Cognitive effects
 
- The head space of 2C-E is described by many as one which is both insightful and relatively unaltered in its thought processes even at moderate to high dosages. Some users suggest that 2C-E may be even more clearheaded than [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) or [2C-C](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-C) especially at higher dosages. 
- **[Analysis enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Analysis_enhancement)** - This component is [introspection](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Introspection) dominant and consistently manifested only in the context of a non-social setting in which the user is alone.
- **[Empathy, affection, and sociability enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Empathy,_affection,_and_sociability_enhancement)** - This component is consistently manifested only in the context of social settings in which one is within the company of others. These feelings are a little weaker and less sharp than those produced by substances such as [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) and [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) but still often prove strong enough to provide long-lasting therapeutic effects.
- **[Conceptual thinking](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Conceptual_thinking)**
- **[Creativity enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Creativity_enhancement)**
- **[Emotion enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Emotion_enhancement)**
- **[Immersion enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Immersion_enhancement)**
- **[Increased music appreciation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_music_appreciation)**
- **[Memory suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Memory_suppression)** 
- **[Ego death](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ego_death)**
- **[Novelty enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Novelty_enhancement)**
- **[Personal bias suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Personal_bias_suppression)**
- **[Increased libido](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_libido)**
- **[Thought acceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_acceleration)**
- **[Thought connectivity](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_connectivity)**
- **[Time distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Time_distortion)**
- **[Wakefulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness)** ### Auditory effects
 
- - **[Enhancements](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_enhancement)**
- **[Distortions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_distortion)**
- **[Hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_hallucinations)** ### Multi-sensory effects
 
- - **[Synaesthesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Synaesthesia)** - In its fullest manifestation, this is a very rare and non-reproducible effect. Increasing the dosage can increase the likelihood of this occurring, but seems to only be a prominent part of the experience among those who are already predisposed to synaesthetic states. However, many reports indicate that this substance is relatively reliable at inducing synaesthetic states.{citation needed### Transpersonal effects
 
- - **[Spirituality enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spirituality_enhancement)**
- **[Existential self-realization](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Existential_self-realization)**
- **[Unity and interconnectedness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Unity_and_interconnectedness)**
### Combination effects

- **[Cannabis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cannabis)** - When used in combination with cannabis, both the visual and cognitive effects of 2C-E can be intensified and extended with extreme efficiency. This should be used with extreme caution if one is not experienced with psychedelics as this can also amplify the [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [confusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Confusion) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) producing aspects of cannabis significantly.
- **[Dissociatives](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociatives)** - When used in combination with dissociatives, the geometry, euphoria, dissociation and hallucinatory effects are often greatly enhanced. Dissociative-induced [holes, spaces, and voids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_disconnection#Holes.2C_spaces_and_voids) while under the influence of 2C-E have significantly more vivid visuals than dissociatives alone present, and more intense [internal hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucinations) , and corresponding [confusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Confusion) which can spontaneously manifest as [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) .
- **[MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA)** - When used in conjunction with MDMA, the physical and cognitive effects of MDMA are amplified. The visual, physical and cognitive effects of 2C-E are also intensified with an overwhelming euphoric pleasure manifested through uniquely pleasurable body highs and headspaces, and uniquely colorful and awe-inspiring visuals. The synergy between these substances is unpredictable, and it is best to start with markedly lower dosages than one would take for both substances individually. **Additionally, users should be aware that there are reasons to believe that this combination may result in unforeseen neurotoxic effects, so a strong sense of caution and independent research are highly advised if one decides to experiment with this combination.** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol)** - This interaction is not typically recommended due to alcohol’s ability to cause [dehydration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dehydration) , [nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea) and [physical fatigue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_fatigue) which can negatively affect a trip if taken in moderate to high dosages. This combination is, however, typically considered to be safe in low doses and can often "take the edge off" a trip as well as dull its psychedelic effects in a fashion somewhat similar to benzodiazepines, albeit in a more physically distressing manner.
- **[Benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines)** - When used in combination with benzodiazepines, benzodiazepines can, depending on the dosage, slightly to completely reduce the intensity of the cognitive, physical and visual effects of an 2C-E trip. They are very efficient at stopping ["bad trips"](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bad_trip) at the cost of amnesia and reduced trip intensity. Caution is advised when acquiring them for this purpose due to the very high addiction potential that benzodiazepines possess.
- **[Psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics)** - When used in combination with other psychedelics, each substance's physical, cognitive and visual effects intensify and synergize strongly. **The synergy between these substances is unpredictable, and for this reason generally not advised.** If choosing to combine psychedelics, it is recommended to start with significantly lower dosages than one would take for either substance individually.

## Toxicity and harm potential

The toxicity and long-term health effects of recreational 2C-E use do not seem to have been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dose is unknown. This is because 2C-E is a [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) with a limited history of human usage.

Anecdotal reports suggest that there are no negative health effects attributed to simply trying this substance by itself at low to moderate doses and using it very sparingly (although nothing can be completely guaranteed). [Independent research](https://www.google.com/) should always be conducted to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe before consumption.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) , such as [volumetric dosing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Volumetric_dosing) , when using this substance so as to ensure the accurate administration of the intended dose.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

Although no formal studies have been conducted, it is not unreasonable to assume that like psychedelics in general, 2C-E is not habit-forming and that the desire to use it can actually decrease with use.

Tolerance to the effects of 2C-E is built almost immediately after ingestion. After that, it takes about 1-2 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 2-4 days to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). 2C-E presents cross-tolerance with all [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) but not evenly, meaning that after the consumption of 2C-E, some psychedelics will have significant reduced effects while some others will only be slighly affected.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **[Lithium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_(medication))** - Lithium is commonly prescribed for the treatment of [bipolar disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder) . There is a large body of anecdotal evidence that suggests taking it with [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) significantly increases the risk of [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) and [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) . As a result, this combination is strictly discouraged.
- **[Cannabis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cannabis)** - Cannabis may have an unexpectedly strong and unpredictable synergy with the effects of 2C-E. Caution is advised with this combination as it can significantly increase the risk of adverse psychological reactions like [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) , and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) . Users are advised to start off with only a fraction of their normal cannabis dose and take long breaks between hits to avoid unintentional overdose.
- **[Stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants)** - Stimulants like [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) , [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) or [methylphenidate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylphenidate) affect many parts of the brain and alter [dopaminergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) function. This combination can increase the risk of [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) , and [thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops) . This interaction may also result in an elevated risk of [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) . [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol)** - Tramadol is well-documented to lower the seizure threshold and [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) may act to trigger seizures in susceptible individuals. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
