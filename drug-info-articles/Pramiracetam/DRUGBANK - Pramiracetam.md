## Overview

### Description

This compound belongs to the class of organic compounds known as alpha amino acids and derivatives. These are amino acids in which the amino group is attached to the carbon atom immediately adjacent to the carboxylate group (alpha carbon), or a derivative thereof.

### Background

Pramiracetam has been previously approved in some eastern European countries under the brand names Pramistar, Neupramir, and Remen. It was also previously approved in the United States with orphan drug designation
1
. Pramiracetam has been studied for the use in Alzheimer's disease and as an adjunct treatment to restore cognitive functioning post-electroconvulsive therapy in severe depression
