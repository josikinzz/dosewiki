EFFECTS LIST #
 
DESCRIPTION #
 
LSZ's effects are considered quite similar to LSD's effects, with a slightly shorter duration. Some users have reported that nausea is more prominent with LSZ than with LSD, but there are not a large number of reports as of December, 2013. As with any psychedelic, LSZ acts as a psychological amplifier. Colors may be enhanced, patterns may be perceived, and the user may feel connected to others and to the universe at large. On the negative side, users may become paranoid or feel as if they are dying.
 
CAUTION & DISCLAIMER #

LSZ
 
Dose
 
by Erowid
 
LSZ (Lysergic acid 2,4-dimethylazetidide) is extremely potent, like its chemical cousin LSD. LSZ is detectably active below 50 micrograms (ug) and strongly active over 100 or 200 ug. 
 
 
DOSAGE DESCRIPTION #
 
Caution : Dose information should not be taken as recommendations. [ see below ]
 
**LSZ Dosages**
**Oral**
**( very tentative )**
- Threshold: 10 ug
- Light: 50 - 100 ug
- Common: 100 - 300 ug
- Strong: 200+ ug
 
LSZ is an ergoloid most commonly found on blotter. LSZ has three stereoisomers and one of the three is substantially more potent than the other three. A racemic mixture of LSZ (not stereo pure for the most potent S,S isomer) will have different effective dosages than S,S-pure LSZ. 
 
 Extreme caution and care must be used if it is ever encountered as a powder/crystal, though that form is rare and has not been seen in retail markets. Most or all LSZ in 2013/2014 has been available as blotter.
 
NOTES #
 
Because LSZ's first widespread commercial availability was in mid 2013, there are only a small number of reports of human use. Dose information must be considered tentative. Although most reports indicate dosage similar to or lower than (more potent than) LSD, it's possible that a small number of people are unusually sensitive or insensitive to LSZ.
 
CAUTION & DISCLAIMER #
 
Every individual reacts differently to every chemical. 
 
 Erowid's dosage information is a summary of data gathered from users, research, and other resources. This information is intended to describe the range of dosages people report using. It should not be construed as a recommendation of any sort. Individuals can respond very differently to the same dosage. What is safe for one can be deadly for another.
