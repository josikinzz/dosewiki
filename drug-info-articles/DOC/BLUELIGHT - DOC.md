**IMPORTANT!  READ HERE FIRST: [DOX Safety Discussion Thread](https://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads/768187-The-safety-(or-lack-therof)-of-DOX-chemicals-discussion-thread)**


Original post:


I'd love to hear anything about this compound besides what can be found in PiHKAL:


"*DOSAGE: 1.5 - 3.0 mg.


DURATION: 12 - 24 h.


QUALITATIVE COMMENTS: (with 1.6 mg) I was hit with a slightly light head; the effects were quite real. I was disconnected, and somehow spacey, but this was a favorable spacey which was kind of fun. Somewhere at about the sixth hour I realized that I was beginning to drop off a bit, but six hours later yet, there was still a lot of memory. This is a long thing.


(with 2.4 mg) This is what I might call an archetypical psychedelic. Everything is there in spades, with few if any of the subtle graces, the `gentle images' and `gentle fantasies' of the 2-carbon phenethylamines. This is the works. There are visuals, and there are interpretive problems with knowing just where you really are. The place where nothing makes sense, and yet everything makes sense. I have just slept for a few hours, and now I am awake and it has been eighteen hours, and there is a lot still going on, although I have a relaxed, good feeling. Anyone who uses this had better have 24 hours at their disposal.


(with 2.4 mg) Here I am at the sixth hour, and I am still roaring along at a full plus three. I have established that this material is neither anti-erotic nor anorexic. The body is very comfortable, and so is the mind. There is an interesting aspect, perhaps peculiar only to this experiment and under these conditions. With my eyes closed the fantasy is a completely dark screen, lovely and seductive, subtle, and yet light must be deliberately brought in. This is not in any way negative for being in the dark, but is just unusual. I will have to try this in the daylight next time, to see what the eyes-closed brings to the mind-screen. At 24 hours, I have found that my sleep was not too great. My dreams were tight, and I kept defending against trouble; the nervous system was too alert. I was in a good humor, though, and I still am. This is excellent stuff, but start early in the day.


EXTENSIONS AND COMMENTARY: It is clear that the three halo-amphetamine derivatives, DOI, DOB and DOC, are all pretty much of the same potency. And all of them very long lived. The difference between the various halogen atoms was brought up under the 2C-C discussion. DOC is clearly a long-lasting, dyed-in-the-wool psychedelic. *"

Three things… 


1) + + + + awesome.


2) TR?


3) 20 mg. is the highest dose I have personally seen… please be sure to include in any discussion of your dosing that you have previously dosed in lower levels working up and that you have recently (or currently) take various Rx medications.


Look forward to reading more details… if it is possible.

After a 6mg trip, I had a lot of sore muscles.. moreso than with anything else I've taken. Some of this was probably the way I was controrting myself: crawled up on top of the dryer.. about 6 ft off the ground, 2ft from the ceiling; layed on my chest for a while, trying not to let my arms or legs touch the ground;  hanging upside down off the back of the couch; chasing the dog under a small coffee table and behind a sofa, etc..


This was on friday, and my neck felt back to normal yesterday. The strain was giving me a near constant (but tolerable) headache. Naproxen sodium fixed it.


During the trip, and for maybe 10 hours after I felt like I was having trouble with my body temperature. My head felt very hot, to the point it was uncomfortable. I asked my girlfriend to see if I felt overheated, and she didn't think so. I also checked my temperature with an "instant" thermometer (the ear kind) many many times, and it was always normal. I had to point a fan at me to get to sleep it bothered me so much. I used an oral mecury thermometer after I sobered up a bit, and it showed a normal temp as well.


It wrecked my stomach a little bit as I was coming up. It wasn't anywhere near as bad as the 2mg I took after eating french fries though. This felt more like I had too much stomach acid. I didn't have any antacids, so I tried some baking soda in water. It seemed to help a little bit, but I think it was just because it made me burp. I drank a little bit of some highly carbonated soda that did the same thing, it provided much more relief. The discomfort went away after the drug really began to take a firm hold.


A word of caution:

I really would not recommend taking more than 4mg of this stuff and going out into public unless you have tried such an amount at home first. If I had gone for a walk or to a party I wouldnt have been able to make it back. I was fried to the point that I *had* to lay down and dissolve. Maybe I'm a little more sensitive, I don't know... but its not a chance I'd want to take.

**DOC water solubility?**


Hi, I am obtaining a 2 dram (112 drops approx) amber dropper vial and counting approximately 100 drops of distilled water into it. I then apply 100mg DOC to the amount of water, shaking it to even the mixture - has this worked for anyone?


as far as being able to dose 1 mg / drop.


Wanted to check before I attempted this. thanks.


also is DOC unstable compound? if I observe it under a light bulb will the light destroy it (photoreactive)?

Theoretically if i wanted .5mg / drop I could use 200 drops, right?


The eye droppers in the vial are pretty accurate as far as each drop being even.

It's water soluble right?

kinesis420, yes, it is water soluble. Meanwhile, have a look at this thread:

I suggest you don't use drops as an accurate way of measuring.

**DOC in Ethanol**


Ok so I'm thinking take a nice cold preparation of ethanol and count out 150 drops into a 3 dram dropper vial, do it quickly and accurately, immediatly seal the vial and put it in the freezer, will it stay preserved or lose potency and will 1 drop be .75mg? and yes i meant 20mg accurate scale not .20

Its never gonna be exact! Each drop is gonna be different from the next at least by a fraction. i.e. each drop will drop .75mg, .50mg, 1mg, to 1.5mg.


It mite be beter to just lay it on blotter for personal use. 

Be careful

No, it won't be that amount in each drop. And what volume of liquid are you considering to be a drop, anyway?


That scale way too inaccurate for dealing with a drug of this potency. And cold ethanol is going to be one of the more difficult substances you could choose to dissolve the stuff in. And if its near saturation (no idea what volume you mean by 150 drops), keeping it in the freezer may cause some of the drug to fall out of solution.


Loss of potency should be the absolute least of your concerns.

**doc solubility**


so liquid measure is no means accurate? even if fully dissolved? im using amber dropper vials they have a glass dropper attached to the cap which is made of rubber for insulation and to squeeze drops out etc.


if i cant get 1 mg per drop maybe i can get 75% ? .75mg per drop with 150 counted drops of distilled water?


Ill seal it tightly and store in the fridge.

Liquid measure is fine. In fact, unless you had a scale that would measure a tenth of a milligram accurately and experience dealing with very small amounts of chemicals, I wouldn't reccomend any other method.


I'm just saying that if your scale is accurate to 20mg, thats a 40mg window of error. You could think you have 100mg, but you could actually have anything between 80mg and 120mg... and thats if your scale is well made and as accurate as it is supposed to be.


So thats a range of 0.53mg to 0.8mg per drop, assuming you don't lose anything and each drop is exactly the same size (probably won't be).


So 5 drops could be a dose of 2.65mg, or 4.00mg. Thats a significant variance... and you'll never know about it until you eat it.

ok well i am strongly assured this is 100mg of doc. no more no less. it looks and seems like such on top of weigh this on a scale that my friend owns. can i just do 1 mg per drop if i wish? does it have to be more dilute? is voss water good for this? i hear its pretty pure.


is this stuff photoreactive ? if i hold it in the light to observe it will it break down? do i need to keep it in darkness? thanks.

and what about potency loss in water?

each drop IS the same size, its measured on glass and the vial is 2 drams which is approximately 114 drops measured.

Christ man.. DON'T USE DROPS TO MEASURE ANYTHING. Read. That scale your friend owns CANNOT measure the exact amount. It has just been explained that there will be a 40 mg margin of error, it can be 120 mg it can be 80 mg, just because you're assured it's 100  mg does NOT mean it is. 


A good solution would be 1mg per 5 ml. That's 500 ml for 100 mg. Use something like that, nothing else. If you don't listen, don't even bother asking questions anymore.


No it is not photoreactive, DOC is pretty stable, also in solution. Ofcourse you want it stored in a cool, dry, dark place to ensure there will be no loss of potency.

Having only a rather sparse experience with LSD in the past and with  my affection for ketamine superceding everything else...let me just say that 4 mgs of DOC feels like fuckin humdinger bliss ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif) tripping right now as we speak.


(note: i havent taken mdma or ketamine in three years)

Well, i tried 3mg of DOC on new years eve.


I started coming up within 30min and peaked by 75min.

While coming up i vomited once but after that i experienced no body load what so ever. In fact i enjoyed the body high.


This is definetly some really magical stuff, i could tell even from my 3mg which only got me to a weak +++. I wouldnt go comparing it to LSD though, which i consider the holy grail, but it was amazing.


During the trip i experienced no anxiety at all and had MDMA like waves of euphoria wash over me. It wasnt very visual but my mind would flow away into these deep fantasies to places i cant even really describe.


Next time i will try 5mg, as 3mg made me trip but not nearly as hard as i would have liked to. I would compare 3mg to maybe 2 hits of acid or 16mg of 2c-e in intensity.


This stuff definetly has potential, cant wait to try a higher dose.


Oh yeh, i would not recomend taking this without a benzo on hand. I was not able to fall asleep untill 19 hours after i ingested it, at which point i was very exhausted and just wanted to go to sleep but had to much energy to do so.


So, im in the camp that thinks this stuff is really amazing, just in my case i think i would need to dose higher to see its true potential.


peace,

cat

Just did my first small test dose. Smoked a joint,  Snorted 1mg about 15 minutes ago, then plugged 60mg morphine right after.  Im feeling extremly euphoric, music sounds incredible, and the effects on color are amazing.  As I type right now the screen is changing colors to the music.  Incredible.


Maybe next weekend I will try 1.5mg nassally, and some sort of opiate combo too.  Or would there be any tolerance issues?  How long should I wait before tripping again?


wow this stuff is amazing.

Ah ok about 45 minutes in to it (I think I've been nodding).  I feel like I'm sitting on a cloud.  Visuals are amazing.  My thoughts are quite speedy but in no way would that make me anxious.  My visions is extremley extremley clear (Kind of like the first time I did MDMA). I am thinking of bumping another .5 milligrams (disolved in 1ml water).  That would put me up to about 4.5mg's orally.

In conclusion: I took 4 mgs at 9 pm, felt the effects around 10 and peaked at 11.....tripped real hard till about 10 am and was only able to sleep at 11 am. Woke up at 4pm, still feeling a bit of it in my system till now, 7 pm and I just had my first meal of the day (very little, no appetite.)

I started DOC at 1.4mg and easily got a +3.Great compound and I will write a TR as it was really something to remember,even though the comedown was a bit shitty like DOM  as well.


Obviously,its best to stick to the PIHKAL doses,even though it appears a bit less potent by weight than DOB and the 5mg level looks safe IF YOU CAN HANDLE THE TRIP,maybe its like 10mg DOM as reference..Variance though appears larger with DOC.

Well 10mg of DOM would be enough for me to be hard pushed to think of when I'd want to do it (ie. too much for usual settings such as festival, camping in the great outdoors etc). I think it'd have to be one of those times that you've specially set aside for one of those 'soul-searching' trips.


As such, I think that if I were to try DOC it'd be in the 1-1.5mg first time* and never greater than 3mg except for the above 10mg of DOM conditions.


***** - First 'proper dose'; as usual, I'd take a 0.1-0.2mg dose for my first ever exposure to make sure I didn't have any idiosyncratic reaction

I have a question..


If you were to take .7mg DOC and then take another .7mg 2 hours later would 2 hours after that would it feel roughly like you had taken 1.4mg all at once?

Any other thoughts on this method of dosing?

^^^


The two times I took DOC it had a rather fast come up, with effects within the first hour and strong effects by T+2 hours. So I would say if you spread a dose out that far apart you'd get a slightly weaker but longer lasting experience then if you took it all at once.


I personally find the method of spreading out doses usefull with some psychedelics, but not others. It slows the total come up time, making it easier to settle into the experience. It also lenghthens the total duration, which may or may not be desirable. I generally like to do it with shorter lasting materials, to slow the come up and the come down. With DOC, the comedown is kinda long, and the come up wasn't too fast for me, so I wouldn't want to do it that way. But its a matter of personal preference.

**This is getting annoying as hell...(DOC and scale questions)**


Okay, this is the 4th time I've typed out this thread, and yet, for one reason or another, this is the first time it's (hopefully) readable by others. First time it told me I'm not logged in, then I log in and everything I've typed is erased. Second time I posted it, but it got glitched and turned into a wierd "Big and Dandy DOC Thread", and of course, what I had typed was nowhere to be found. Then I typed it all out again, and once again, I tried to post and it said I wasn't logged in. I log in, and yet again, everything is erased. And I was logged in already both times. This is the shortened version of the old thread. And yeah, I know there was some kind of software problem, but I'm posting this again because I really need an answer within a few hours.


Anyway, someone I know has 2.5 mg of DOC and wants to know if he takes it at ~8:00 pm, if he'll be straight enough to seem normal (if perhaps a bit tired) by about 16-18 hours later? In other words, those of you who've tried it, about how long through the trip was it before you feel you could have at least acted "normally" around others? Include dose, tolerance, and other drugs taken if possible.


Also, if one is going to be measuring out DOC with a scale, would one accurate to 2 mg work if he used the solution method (for instance measure out 15 mg, then dissolve in 15 mL of alcohol and dose by measuring out mL's)? Seems to me like it would be fine if done that way, as inaccuracies would seem to be in the fraction of a mg range, but I'm not entirely sure (obviously it wouldn't work if one were measuring out individual doses with the scale). If it won't work, what's about the cheapest mg scale I can get that would accurately and consistently measure 1-5 mg doses?

The length will vary immensely depending on the chemistry of your body -- I've seen people down and out in 12 hours, and still rolling along at a +2 30 hours later (this was around 2mg with no tolerance).  Most people seem to fall between 12-24 hours, with some residue following for a while.  I wouldn't plan on appearing normal for anything in any less than 24 hours.


The best solution for weighing in this case is liquid, like you stated -- unless you're confident your scale works well to fractions of mgs (a scale with this precision will probably run you over a thousand USD).

I would suggest using liquid measurement for such a small amount of DOC.


If you have a scale accurate to +/- 2mg or so, you can weigh out 20mg and add that to 20ml of alcohol. Then each ml will contain 1mg of DOC once it's fully dissolved.


Even a scale accurate to 1mg will not give you an accurate enough reading if you just try to weigh out 2.5mg.


As for duration... chances are you will be able to look somewhat normal after 18 hours, but you may still be experiencing minor visuals and some body energy from the DOC at this point. It's up to you how "normal" you actually have to be. If your parents or somebody else already suspects drug use, you might want to give yourself a little more time.


Also, some people continue to "trip" for 24 hours from DOC... although 12-18 hours is more typical.

**How can one avoid vomiting when taking DOC?**


Hi guys,


What is the best way to go about this?


Dose on an empty stomach? Dose with a meal? Dose an hour or so after a meal?


After dosing, when is it okay to eat again?

I've taken DOC twice. Once on a full stomach and once on an empty stomach.


I highly recommend taking DOC on a full stomach, the nausea is non-existent and it does not reduce the intensity or duration of the trip at all.


I plan on taking DOC with at least some food in me from now on.

I would recomend taking it about an hour after a meal, preferably something not too heavy, like chicken teriyaki or something. Don't eat a huge meal, maybe half of what you normally would eat, and don't eat anything that is very spicy or acidic.


Also, if you're one of the folks who gets chronic nausea on psychs, apparently taking some dramamine about an hour before helps.


I haven't gotten any nausea from DOC, and I've taken it on an absolutely empty stomach and after eating a meal. 


But I have gotten some mild nausea from some other compounds. One thing that I found was if I laid down when I was coming on, and then stood up, I would get sick (maybe from the contents of my stomach moving around?) But if I went about the house doing things as I came up there was no problems.


If you feel the nausea, let yourself throw up. It's really not that bad, and you will feel a whole lot better right away.

My first dose, i took 2mg somewhere between 30 and 45min afte eating a large amount of french fries from a fast food joint. It make me feel like I had bad acid reflux, and really bothered me for a while.


So the next time (6mg), I didn't eat for 5 hours or so before dosing. I ended up sitting by the toilet for maybe 10 minutes around the 2 hours mark. I felt like I needed to spew so bad, but I just couldn't. I slammed about 8 ounces of water and tried to gag myself. It didn't really work. I ended up vomiting like teaspoon of water, and I don't think I would have done that had I not been trying to make myself throw up and get it over with.


The nausea cleared up soon after that. Its pretty common for me to get fairly nauseous during the early part of a phenethylamine trip though

**DOC Data & Thread Summary**


OK More Data folks.  One analyzed all reports on this Bluelight thread up to 12:00 AM EST 21.1.2006 (831 total posts).  One tried to summarize all clearly reported doses of DOC (63) and include interesting errata for some possible overview data.


5.80 mg.   Overall Average Reported Dose.

4.00 mg.   Average Reported Dose if one throws out the 9 reports > 10mg.


ERRATA:


Several persons reported notable threshold activity around 250-300 micrograms (0.25-0.3 mg.).


Several persons reported very strong responses (‘fully active,’ ‘intense,’ ‘+++’) in the 1-1.5 mg. range.


At least one post alleged no effects at 4 mg.


Some reports of rectal administration.


A report of an accidental dose of 15-20 mg. rectally due to the compound being mistaken for 2C-C/2C-I.


A report of 3-6 mg. insufflated and a report of 10 mg. insufflated.


psychicpsycho reported an ingestion of 15 mg. that pretty much had him ‘done’ with psychedelics. 


blab reported notable tolerance when running up dosing as follows: 1,2,3,5,8,13,17,22mg.


crowbar reported taking doses from 0.5 mg up to 20 mg. with adverse effects being noted around 20 mg.


Nuke commented on DOB mortality in the 25-35 mg. range, possibly suggesting that all dosing should remain well below 25 mg.


Blue Dolphin noted side effects as:

“Nausea: 10%

Vomiting: 5% (half of the "nausea" group)

Body Temp Issues: 10%

"Weird Smells": 3%

Excess Stimulation: 15%

Inability to Sleep past the 20-hour mark: 35%”

I'd like to add that I dont hallucinate at all and when I do it is very rare ....with DOC i didnt have open /closed eye visuals although I was trippping hard in the sense that you just "feel" it...the body buzz is really strong.  Sort of like how the world looks to me just prior to my K hole. Anyway I noticed the next day after I took (4 mgs)...i was walking to the carpark to get my car at around 9 pm, there were rainbow color crowns on all the streetlights.

 I got to thinkin, damn, thats probably an aftereffect.

Quite unrelated to recent posts but still related to DOC:


Has anyone on this board smoked the substance? Wikipedia briefly mentions this as route of administration. Just wondering what I'd want to pay attention to (apart from probably a swift come-up) - especially regarding dose and duration, but also other effects.


I'm kinda hoping someone will tell me the experience will be a few hours shorter that way ;-)

I smoked 0.75mg to boost my trip about 6 hours into it. I felt it almost instantly, it was only a modest boost in intensity though.


I have also smoked DOI twice. First time 1.5mg split into two doses about 30 minutes apart with a high dose of poppies, second time 2.5mg split into 2 doses about 10 minutes apart. It takes effect immediately and peaks in under five minutes. The duration is about the same as oral, maybe a little shorter. It feels quite different from an oral dose and mentally not as interesting. Visuals are just as strong though. 


The potency of DOI did not seem to be increased much if at all but if you try smoking it, be careful with the dose. It is likely that some of the chemical was destroyed by the heat, it did leave a little bit of black residue.


I don't know how potent DOC would be smoked because the only time I did it was while tripping on an oral dose and there was a lot of tolerance due to that. I may smoke a small dose when I have the time, just out of curiosity. If I try it, I will post my results in this thread.

So, this is a kind of mini-trip report that I think is suitable to stay in this thread without me making a whole different thread for it.


I took 2mg of this stuff 9 hours ago.


Didn't feel anything for an hour. Then it just felt like a percocet for the next hour. Then for the next hour (3rd hour) it got quite intense and I had some minor visual effects. The only visuals I got lasted maybe 20 minutes and were nothing to write home about. After this experience, I realize that taking a drug to see cool things is somewhat childish. There'a a lot more you can do with your brain than see some cool fractals, guys.


From the three hour point on, it didn't feel like I was tripping at all (I've done mushrooms, salvia, and 2C-I before, so I'm not just saying that). I just felt 'turned on' to life. I was and am completely happy with everything that I am and everything that is. I read "Remember, Be Here Now" and it seemed to go with what I was thinking really well.


This didn't feel like a drug for me once 3 hour had passed. I felt almost 100% sober except for the fact that I was inredibly happy. I suppose I started 'coming down' after about 7 hours. Some effects are still persisting, but it's more or less just some kind of weird feeling in my head.


I don't know if it's because 2 mg was a low dose. But really, I feel it just kinda flicked on some kind of switch in my head and I'm changed in a way that makes me really happy with everything. It brought me to a place that I no longer need a drug to get to.


This isn't just a drug. It didn't change me. It let me change myself.

Ive yet to have a sad or bad DOC trip. The only sad DOx compound trip i had was my 3rd DOI trip at 5mg. This stuff seems to keep you really happy. I used to have to have downers to end the trip after like 12 hours but now i just let it fade you come down gradually. i like it all but im done with it because i did it way too much and we dont really know anything about it.

well it's now T+31 hours. I have felt pretty sober all day, and I still retain my happy perspective on everything that I didn't have before taking this stuff. When I go outside, I actually almost feel high again, even though I am definitely not (most of my trip was done outside, and the whole world just seems more beautiful now). But I can't say what it will be like two weeks after taking it...well because I'm probably going to be doing it at least that often ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif) (probably never more than once a week, though)

I've done DOC 3 times now, and each time I've taken it on a Friday night at 11pm, without sleeping since the morning, and been up until 11 the next night.  The first 8-12 hours of the trip are quite psychedelic, and then the plateau starts.  I usually lie down in my bed for about 2 hours during this time and just kind of trance out in half-sleep, as the drug is amazingly gentle on the body.  For me, the plateau has been quite a bit less psychedelic, and the visuals fade most of the way, and I emerge from the psychedelic haze, so to speak, into an extremely coherent, quick thinking, and humorous stage that I truly love.  I can see how some people might think they were down, since it's no longer very visual or as intense, but it's most definitely still an acute effect of the drug.


I love the two stages of DOC.  The first is deep and crazy and very memorable, and the second is a truly wonderful mood and state of mind that allows for integration of the experience and a wonderful state of mind that seems to last and last.

I've certainly not reached a breakthrough dose on DOC and I truly do not feel that I understand what it has to offer yet.  I'm just slowly moving up in the dosage levels as I find the trip to be rewarding and remarkably enjoyable anyway.  Eventually I will break through, and I have a feeling it will be amazing.

i don't like DOC, it had me pissing every 5 minutes and i felt way too sped up. DOC gets a thumbs down from me. im gonna stick to the shrooms if i want to trip. i don't think this drug will take off, there are better alternatives as previously stated. the only future i can see for DOC would be  for people selling it as LSD.

So I took 5mg of DOC earlier today. Let me say that 5mg is quiiiite different than 2mg. It was pretty intense from about T+2 to T+4 hours. I had lots of strange body feelings. I got kind of sleepy for a little bit (people have been mentioning this too, and I find that SO strange!). I had that anxious PEA 'coming up' feel where it's like your mind/body is anticipating something but you dont know why or what. The bathroom tiles started swirling and climbed up the walls. That was actually the first real tripping visual I've had that did something that I knew just wasn't there. 


I don't know about you guys, but it seems to go into a different phase after about 4 hours. Almost all of the body effects go away, that strange feel of anticipation went away, and I feel a lot calmer. Just kind of high, trippy thinking, with some enhanced colors and stuff. I really like the latter phase, and it fortunately lasts a lot longer than that initial intense peak.

**Another one in the DOC-isn't-THAT-great camp**


%) After ingesting (2mg) DOC for the first time about 24 hours ago and having now woken up after 6 hours of alprazolam-induced sleep I have to say it really is far too long and a bit tiring / strenuous on the body after so many hours... I value how the compound's ability to allow me to let my emotions wash over me while at the same time to stand back and reflect quite soberly on this... also, excellent visuals at some stage, visuals definitely on par with a reasonably strong acid trip. I also appreciate the great access to acceptance and wisdom the compound seems to offer. It allowed me to be creative, but it really, really, really does get groggying after so many hours... it is metabolised a little slowly, and for me it wasn't entirely without body issues (high body temperature, bloated red face with blotchy skin at the T+12hour mark following the insufflation of a mere 30mg of K and the ingestion of 1mg 5-MeO-DIPt and 3mg MIPT <-- don't even ask why I did this!! I really can't even begin to explain) ...  after benzo induced sleep and some coral mineral and activated charcoal and sea salt intake as well as heaps of liquids my face now looks quite normal again though and I probably don't look worse than anyone who had a few beers too many the night before though ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


I could imagine taking this compound again, probably at a higher dose (6mg??) in order to experience the much-touted "vortex reality" but I feel that this maybe at least a year or so in the future. The diifficult metabolisation that psychedelic amphetamines (I had some body issues with DOI, too) seem to have for my body even at 2mg and the ensuing extremely long duration really make this something I will be mostly staying away from in the future.

I'd stick to 2mg or so the first like, like you did, but I feel the compounds really nice effects do not begin until higher doses are taken. I don't mean batshit insane ones, but something like 4-6mg or so.


Unfortunately, the length increases with the dose increase, IMO.

Hmm... I haven't even ever come close to puking on DOC, and I have it in a water and alcohol suspension and absorb it mostly sublingually, all at once.  It just seems to come on slowly enough that it never bothers my stomach at all.


An another note, that 4mg experience I mentioned the other day was really intense and very different from my other experiences.  I'll be writing a report soon.  I didn't reach this "vortex reality", but the entire experience (friday and saturday) felt totally unreal.  I experienced time in very strange ways - it was 2:47 for about half the night it seems, then it was 6:30, then it was 4:50, etc, etc... I tried reading some ketamine trip reports on Erowid because at lower dosages I've found it to greatly enhance my ability to "get into" a written report or other piece of literature and feel like the experience has happened to me, but I just had the same one up from 2am to 6:30 or 8:40, whichever it was when I went to bed.  I just kept reading tiny sections of it and then getting stuck into some massive train of thought.  Strangely, there wasn't anything I'd call a body "load", but the intense energy running through my body was making me constantly squirm about, in a pleasant but very insistent way.  I went to bed at some point as it was getting light, and I don't remember falling asleep, just closing my eyes and then opening them, afetr existing in a field of color.  I honestly felt a little possessed or something ther whole time, like my body was being occupied by myself and something else and I only had partial control.


Very weird.  This was certainly more memorable (though disjointed) than my lower dosages, but VERY different.


Oh, and I really love the length of DOC.  The other very long-lasting drugs like 5-MeO-AMT (ick) that I've tried have lasted annoyingly long, but I just love the next day with DOC, where you're into the second leg of the journey.  it makes for a fun Saturday where I'm in a great and curious and joyful mood with an awesome body buzz.  I also react much better to small amounts of alcohol on that day after, as generally even small amounts of alcohol make me feel kind of poisoned and gross.

I get this with virtually every drug, psychedelic or not. Few are subtle enough to make me forget I am on something. Especially after I have not been using for a while or if I have been fasting and/or meditating a lot beforehand.


DOC is one of the very few drugs that upset my stomach so much that I had to vomit. The vomiting itself was quick and painless though, and I felt better afterwards. Thi happened at the 3-hour mark, when it was beginning to kick in properly (2mg)

By posessed, I mean that I felt like something else was occupying my brain, but that I wasn't aware of it at the time.  Like some sort of delerium.  It's a little creepy to think back on my night and realize that I remember it in little non-sequential flashes.  What did I even do the whole time?  Hell if I know. 


But the visuals were absolutely incredible, by far the most unique and "celestial" looking I've ever seen.  2C-E my first time gave stronger and more classic visuals, but 4mg of DOC did things I'd never imagined before.

I never experienced the possessed feeling on my trials (4.5mg and 6mg) of DOC and felt very in control. I did not find the physical effects of DOC to be pleasant either but I was able to put them in the background..


Perhaps DOC has a disossiative quality to it, for those of you that experience this possessed feeling? I know that Ketamine and high doses of DXM cause me to feel very out of control and on "auto-pilot", as it were.


When I am dancing on 2C-I, I feel extremely possessed...it is like my spine breaks apart from my brain and plugs into the music and I can almost watch myself tossing and flipping glowsticks in ways I never thought possible. This is DOC thread though... I have yet to experience DOC during a rave so perhaps it will be woth a shot. If it is anything similar to LSD though, I will just be just sitting there watching the lights with a permagrin...which I have feeling it would be (no complaints, grant you!)

A glass vial would be ideal, or a screw cap test tube, something like that.


Make sure you mark it as poison, DOC, something like that so someone doesn't use it by accident (this stuff does happen).

Well, i tried DOC at 5mgs and had a very meh experience. Almost nothing visual to speak of despite the hype, and it left me with an overstimulated feeling I would vageuly call "tripping" and a skullcrushing headache that lasted a good 8 hours(started at around the 6 hour mark). Although weed added somewhat to it, which led me to smoking inordinate amounts of "white shark". Welp, so much for first impressions. Next time I will have to try more to see if this puppy can achieve lift off.

Wow, daily, eh?  Well, if there was any psychedelic to do daily, I'd choose DOC... but that's just too much for me.  Gotta have some normality in there to make it special... in any case, I'd like to see that report.


Oh, and I knew someone in high school who basically went psychotic and attacked the police, and they realized that's what went on and just brought him to the hospital.  Not all cops like ruining young peoples' lives for something that they realize was a mistake on that person's part.

**DOC Usage Frequency Data**


Some preliminary data from a survey on DOC indicates that:


40.9 % reported using DOC 1 time

36.4 % reported using DOC 2-5 times

  9.1 % reported using DOC 5-10 times

13.6 % reported using DOC 10-20 times


2 respondents skipped this question


These numbers are from an anonymous survey so they may be skewed, though it is likely that they are fairly reliable (no really big outliers so far).  If anything they may slightly underrepresent the number of uses as some respondents may have used DOC additional times since the survey was completed.  In general though, the data points to most persons (77.3 % ) having used DOC 1-5 times in total.

Has anyone tried sublingual DOC successfully?  I tried 1mg DOC sublingually two weeks ago, got little effects, barely threshold, got very minor CEVs after smoking cannabis.  Didn't notice much else in terms of the DOC, except a very minor "presence" that something more than cannabis was effecting me.  This presence went away after about 6-7 hours.  


Last week I tried a 1.25mg sublingual dose.  I got low, but noticeable effects out of the DOC.  After smoking cannabis, I got distinct CEVs, but nothing to write home about.  My open-eye vision seemed 'sharper.'  Also, I could feel a psychedelic mindstate creeping up, but never quite took hold.  I more or less just got a little "confused."  Laughing seemed to come more easily.  Duration was about 6-8 hours again.


My main question is regarding the method of absorption.  My first trial was by swiping up 1mg of DOC from a glass plate with my finger, and wiping my finger off (and hopefully the DOC) under my tongue.  After not swallowing any saliva for about 45 minutes, I spit all the saliva out of my mouth.  Do you think this was efficient?  Specifically, was 45 minutes enough time for the DOC to absorb?


My second trial was with improvised blotter paper (140lb. watercolor paper).  I ended up having to use EIGHT square inch pieces of paper to absorb all of the alcohol/DOC solution.  I kept these eight pieces of paper under my tongue for about 30 minutes, then sort of mashed them up with my teeth, but still kept them in my mouth, for another half hour.  After having the paper in my mouth for 60 minutes, and not swallowing any saliva, I spit everything out.


Is 45-60 minutes enough time for the DOC to absorb sublingually (considering it's supsended in blotter paper)?  Also, how do you suggest I concentrate my DOC/alcohol solution so, for instance, .25ml = 1mg as opposed to 1ml = 1mg?  I was thinking I could just drop out the dose I want onto a piece of aluminum foil, let most of the alcohol evap, then dip the blotter in the (smaller) pool of alcohol. But, as the alcohol evaporates, won't it leave behind some DOC clinging to the walls of the aluminum foil?


Any ideas would be appreciated.

I've always taken DOC sublingually because for some reason I always end up dosing it shortly after eating.  I have it dissolved in a solution containing probably 35% ethanol and the rest distilled water, and I hold it under my tongue for about 15 minutes and swallow.  It starts at about 45 minutes to an hour, and hits fully around 2 to 2.5 hours in, with a peak at maybe 4 hours.


I very much doubt it's any different from oral consumption, unless you're trying to avoid having it slowed down by the contents of your stomach.

I've taken DOC at 2.7mg, 4.4mg and 7mg, a couple of weeks spaced apart. 


The first time I took it @ 2.7mg I think I was surprised at how deep it took me into a field of Gaiain connectivity... with full power earth/human activation which was archetyptally yogic in its imagery and energy. 


I also found I was also to go deep into releasing limitations based on conceptions or images I had made of life before I was five years old... very strong releases here...


I found I was able to let go and come into a sense of stillness and transparency which enabled my energy body to move and free itself from the chains of emotional denial... 


At this dose the +3 effects would have only lasted a few hours... I dosed at 6.30am and was able to sleep fine that night with a little valium. 


When I took it @ 4.4mg, it was not signifcantly stronger, I felt like I sincerely cracked something open with the first dose and this dose was consolidating that. 


Most of the time, I let my jaw go, and shake and just release fear... I could see a visual/organic field, but I was separate from it... kind of like mushrooms, very orange and brown. 


It was a very pleasant contemplative day....no major revelations. 


On that day, I took it at 8.30am and got to sleep @ 2am. 


A couple of week later, I took 7mg to see what would happen if I went "in there" for a number of hours...  having no idea what to expect really. I took it at 3pm. 


This was an unexpectably strong dose.... it was truly psychedelic in the way that 1000 mics of clean acid is. 


The messages and imprints and visuals coming through were very different though, they had their own texture and particular perspective... I was able to go about as deep into my own somatic and emotional, genetic imprints as I have ever gone... allowing much realisation and seeing. 


I am someone who has been working intensively with ayahuasca for 6 years or so... so it was surprising to me that I was able to go this far with this material!


(ayahuasca tends to be quite cosmic for me!) 


Now, the other thing is that it took about two weeks to feel fully physically repaired from this experience... it was definately communicated to me that this compound could very well be deleterious at high doses. 


And so I couldn't recommend a dose as high as 7mg whatsoever! 


I also couldn't recommend DOC as an LSD replacement... as a 'tripping' tool... it is just too serious and hardcore... it cuts very deep and yet has something of a throwaway disposable cartoonish element to it.... the compound came to once and pronounced its full chemical name in a radiohead ok computer voice, and said, "they call me the christ maker!" and I had this image of "DOC" as a "Bender" like figure operating on "the average age of the combat psychonaught - 19", on a stretcher... perhaps a bit too Dr Nickish for my liking! 


I also heard yells and should and squeels of urban violence and gang warfare and of kids challenging each other to take more and more DOC. 


I also felt there were beings using this compound to take readings and survaille humanity. 


I didn't feel comfortable with the morphic fabric of this material, seemingly being relatively young Nth Americans... a very slanted perspective of the world... 


(their skin screases are becoming darkier and dorkier!) 


After the profusion of personal information and processing, I blacked out,  screaming and convulsing for a few hours... I don't remember most of this... so I am told. 


I am used to this kind of thing at high doses of any psychedelic... and it doesn't concern me, if I am coming into contact with my own pain or there is some kind of struggle or movement there, I feel this is something positive. 


I "came to" at about 3am...feeling surprisingly positive...much had been revealed certainly! 


There is real power in this material.  It cuts deep... at one point, I was watching the setting sun and felt the energy move through my body and spiral through my body, feeling very penetrated by it all...  


I took DOB six years and it changed my life, in the way it allowed me to connect and work with various levels of psychic and earth energies... 


I feel the value in these series of compounds lies in connecting with the earth and consciously choosing to work through, particulary deep emotional material blocking ones growth and progress. 


The text book for DOC I would suggest is Chogyam Trungpa's "The Myth of Freedom"

Wow.. 


welll anyway since so many people are tripping on DOC often, at low or high doses do you notice the super enhanced, incredibly high quality vision? Its like your brain's visual area's are operating at high res mode for FINE detail and color (like a 100 trillion megapixel digital camera) but just like a CRT computer monitor the frame rate seems to drop way down, depending on quality.


I tend to get this more noticeable during the comedown phase, or after peak, i can only see snapshots every 1/2 second or so, but its the best vision i've ever seen in my life.   Not good for fast activities where you need to see things fast though...

Yeah, it improved my vision I'd say, though perhaps less dramatically than you report.  However, in the dark I feel that my vision is reduced, just because of the patterns and colors swirling about, obscuring what I could normally only vaguely see.  I love the color enhancement as well.


Also, man, the DOC visuals are something else.  I get some sort of "magic eye" effect with them sometimes, too.  I'll see, for example, shining bars of light when I look at the bathtub, but they appear to be floating somewhere in the space between it and me.

So far, my only experience with DOC was low, 1.6mg (+/- 5%). 


I was suprised at the brevity of the peak effects, given the long overall duration - the peak visual and mental changes were present for at most 3 hours, then tailing off quite quickly after that.


I found it very lethargic in therapeutic terms - any attempts to do serious cognititve delving was met with a kind of "ah I just can't really be bothered" by both body and mind. This may have been to do with the unpleasent background GI disturbances which were present throughout the experience, which tinged my thought processes negatively.


However, at t+11 hrs, I insufflated ~200mg ketamine, and had a very pleasent experience - the imagery was multilayered and complex as always, but included anrogeny, guitar feedback, and deserts (no doubt helped by listening to Earth Phase 3: Thrones and Dominions - specifically "Agni Detonating over the Thar Desert").


After recovering from that, I was treated to some helpful insights towards my own attitude to mortality, and felt suggested that this would be a good subject to explore again, as well as some timely re-framing of some of my harder to live with personal attitudes.


These insights were not particulary deep, but very welcome, and helpful pointers to further areas of exploration.

I find my DOC experiences to be much the same, even at dosages up to 4mg (the highest I've gone).  I always intend to do some work and writing, but I can never seem to be bothered, instead being more driven to simply experience whatever is in front of me.  I find it at once both frustrating and refreshing.

Why has this chemical just been "discovered"  It just seems odd that all these unresearched chemicals have been around so long, yet DOC has just gained extreme popularity in the last few months.  I remember seeing a post asking about it, then a few weeks later everyone on the block had tested it!  Just seems kinda wierd, is there a legitimate explination or is it just about what supply companies offer.  


Before a few months ago very few bluelighters had researched DOC and now there is 45 pages of chat about it and it doesnt look like things are slowing down.

there was an insane amount of hype in the beginning.  I was skeptical about it, but after trying it, I've discovered the hype was well deserved.

Its because even though Shulgin invented/tested most of these and reported on them, its up to people (chemists that are already going to, or are making these things) to take the risk and decide hmm lets see, i could brew up some DOB because that one is known, or pick something not so known that i can make?


People have probably made DOC before (the bees etc) ate it and loved it, but just no reports got out into the 'public' like this.


I know people are always making shit, but often its something already known to be good.. with most chem suppliers they took a look at P/Tihkal (and if there's any info on the net) and picked some to have made that probably looked good or ones that Shulgin had a lot to say about.


Hehh... i dunno but i sure wish somebody out there would fuck around with the psilocin molecule and try to make some analog that retains the N,N-DMT but arrange something new on the 4 position so its at least an analog but hopefully a lot like psilocin or at least retains that "DMTish" quality.

are you suggesting 4-aco-DMT rather than 4-ho-dmt?

^^ Well 4-aco-dmt might degrade into psilocin, probably not much I read 4-AcO-DMT is pretty stable moreso than psilocybin but who knows.. Yeah i'd LOVE this to be available but i highly doubt any RC company would make it, if there's a possibility of it degrading into a Sch. I. (outside the body).  


I don't know how hard it would be for someone to make 4-MeO-DMT just to taste it, or 4-methyl or even 4-Fluoro or something, would be nice to see reports on the effects.  I've tasted TMT or alpha-methyl-DMT (DMT with another methyl on the alpha position) and it was much better than AMT but the extra methyl being on the N,N side of the molecule totally changes its action - felt a lot more like DiPT to me, with some similar sound distortions but different, never got to take it again or push the dose up - but i heard it does kick ass at the right dose.


I guess anything on the 4 position that keeps it from being eaten by MAO and won't degrade into psilocin would be stuff i'd wanna try out ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png).


Also curious what 4-HO/AcO/PO-NMT would be like alone, all thats said about baeocystin i ever found was "its like psilocin".  Well if Shulgin is right about psilocybin and that the phosphoryloxy group has to be chopped off and for psilocin to be active, but the acetoxy group doesn't (4-aco-mipt/dipt or the HO versions are different drugs), then its possible 4-AcO-DMT might feel a tad different, since it can get into the brain before any conversion to HO.


Uh, guess this is off topic ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png).

If there are any synthetic chemists reading this thread, how about being adventurous and synthesizing 4-vinyl-DMT. You only have to look at the 'acid, dragonflies...' thread for reasoning behind it.

Dunno how people can do DOx compounds so often. They are so long-lasting that, for me anyway, it is out of teh question to do them regularly - even on a monthly basis would feel way too often for me. I find them more stressful than 2Cs and even most tryptamines. And I can imagine there's a huge tolerance with it. If it takes the body that long to metabolise the stuff, it is not surprising that tolerance will remain for quite some time afterwards. Up to 2 weeks, maybe more even?? Even with 2Cs done weekly I found that some minimal tolerance issue remains.


Seems to me DOC and the liek are not made to be ingested so often... tolerance being one reason, the long duration and body stress factor (that some have reported on) being another.


But maybe I'm just too old physically and mentally to want to ingest something that strong too often. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

When I first got my DOC, I did it 3 weekends in a row, each time on Friday night.  I noticed a VERY slight tolerance, but each dose (2mg, 3mg, then 4mg) was substantially stronger than the last.  The thing that was reduced, however, was the later stage of clarity and comprehension.  With my first 2mg dose, it was tremendous, and I felt like my mind had been clarified to a shocking extent.  it was truly awesome.  The next time the peak was more intense, but the later phase was less euphoric, and the third time, (with 4mg) the peak was so intense I can hardly remember parts of it, but the later phase was almost nothing like it was with the first experience.  it was still enjoyable but didn't have that "sparkle" of the first experience.

I used DOC for a third time a couple of weeks ago. I dosed 5.5 mg at 7:00 PM and, not even expecting to, dosed off at about 6:30 am till about 8:30 am. I had just layed in bed in a rather content state, still somewhat awe inspired, not really expecting to get any sleep, but just resting my body. The two hours of sound sleep was a pleasant surprise. I wasn't planning on being productive in the following day after the trip, but for me two hours sleep vs. no sleep at all is the difference between feeling a little off and feeling like shit.


This was quite a contrast from my first DOC trip, where I found the effects speedy and uncomfortable. I think it just shows you the power of the mind over the body. During the first trip the dose was too low to impress me with psychedelic effects, and so I dwelled on the uncomfortable sensations in my body, only making them worse.


I spent most of the peak of the trip going for a walk in the park, it was a mild clear night. I got lost in thinking about numerous thought experiments in physics, in particular information theoretic approaches to developing QM as a principle theory. This is a problem some theoretical physicists have been working on the last 15 years or so, mainly due to the advent of quantum computing, which I've been studying over the last few months. While I certainly didn't come up with any great revelations, I found this drug profoundly useful for these types of contemplations in physics. 


For example, for split moment contemplating the gravity/acceleration postulate that underlies general relativity, the nature of hyperbolic geometry (curved space time) became as immediately intuitive to me as euclidean geometry normally is. In fact, I had never visualized hyperbolic geometry so clearly. However, this is certainly not a drug to grab a pencil and piece of paper and start writing out math or physics equations. I could 'see' hyperbolic geometry with clarity but no way could I do proofs in it, just like one can typically 'see' euclidean geometry but doing actual proofs in it is another issue. Still, it was great just to 'see' it like I had never seen it before.


The clarity of and depth insight on this drug is amazing. I suspect this drug can be a good tool for almost any deep contemplation you wish to have. But preserving that clarity while translating such insights into sober terminology is another challenge entirely.

I have been looking over the [data I have received so far on DOC,](http://www.surveymonkey.com/DisplaySummary.asp?SID=1745359&U=174535967586) and it looks interesting.  Assuming there is not some sort of super-hype placebo effect or large response bias driving the data, this really is a very powerful psychedelic compound.  The PiHKAL entry where someone talked about “This is what I might call an archetypical psychedelic. Everything is there in spades…” seems to have hit the nail on the head.  Then again, I just read on another board a post by TokeTrip about how some teenagers under 18 all went to the hospital on account of taking massive (and possibly “eyeballed”) doses of DOC.  They reportedly took 8 mg., 15 mg., & 25 mg.!  This one is starting to sound like its DOM cousin… potentially of great use to some and soon to become the bane of ER staff (much to the joy of the DEA, Dr. Phil, Oprah, & co.).  If this should start regularly showing up on blotter… ugh…

While 2,0mg of DOC produced only the slightest treshold effects, 2,5mgs produced very noticeable effects that were clearly pronounced with cannabis.


There was very little bodyload, the comeup was smooth and no anxiety at all. A relaxed and a pretty euphoric mind state, very little confusion. There was some muscle tension in the muscles of the back and neck but it didn't get too uncomfortable. No real visuals, although with eyes closed there would have been. I was in a public place so I was reluctant to keep my eyes closed for long enough to get into the visuals.


I'm unsure how steep the dosage curve after the 2,5mg point will be, I suspect 3,0mgs will produce open eye visuals and produce more confusion.


I'm also suprised that I can sleep around 6-7 hours after the comeup.

Is the insomnia closely related to the dose? What are your experiences?

The dosage seems to vary between people.  For me, 2mg of DOC produced very few visuals but a definitely strong mental change.  2.5mg produced definite distinctive visuals and a slightly chaotic headspace.  3.2mg produced a massively strong, somewhat delerious state which I just posted a report about, with amazingly intense visuals and a peeling back of reality coupled with receptiveness to a collective reptilian consciousness.  From my experience, I'd say the dose response curve is quite steep.  On the other hand, some people on these boards take 10-12mg and get weaker effects than I've reported from 3.2.  So it seems quite variable.  Then again, I have the feeling that some people constantly exaggerate their doses, or take psychedelic every day and have a massive tolerance.


I too can sleep on DOC.  It's really a very gentle psychedelic for how intense it is.

I find DOC very enligtening, to the point of 2c-e.  Also it lacked stimulant effects, I'm very sensitive to stimulants- I don't even drink caffinated beverages and have a downright negative reaction to amphetamines.


I really believe that these drugs all work, and if someone finds them less 'enlightening' or some such crap, it's because they only took it a couple of times, in the wrong environment or state of mind.  Just my very humble opinion. ;P

**Unfortunate Updates**


Recently a number of unfortunate incidents have come to my attention involving DOC.  The first is a [published newspaper report](http://www.hometownlife.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060601/NEWS22/606010659/1039/RSS15)of several teenagers being hospitalized due to psychological abreactions.  The second is a report of a death involving someone who was driving under the influence of DOC.


Excerpt from an article originally published June 1, 2006 in Michigan USA:

> It began May 24, when Bloomfield Township police officers reported a 17-year-old girl from their town was taken to the hospital for a possible drug overdose. She reportedly had been at a house on Malvern in Troy where she claimed she took the drugs. Officers responded to the home, where the 19-year-old man who lived at the home refused them entry. 
> 
> 
> 
> While speaking with the 19-year-old, officers learned three other individuals within the home were experiencing reactions to the same substance. An 18-year-old man from Bloomfield Hills was seen walking into the walls, dazed and completely naked. He was brought to the door and taken to the hospital. Two other men from Bloomfield Township, 18 and 19 respectively, that also reportedly ingested the substance, were disoriented and dazed. They also were brought out and taken to the hospital.

I am attempting to confirm the veracity of this report, including the actual date, location, etc.


It looks like DOC is both increasingly available and increasingly being used by people with little detailed knowledge or responsibility.  I have said it before, but it probably bears repeating: This one may well have “the glory and the doom sealed up in it” like its methyl cousin.

I've read through some of this thread, some of the info on Erowid, even looked itup in PihKAL or TihKaL. But I still don't know enough about it yet to decide whether it's worth trying... So I h ave some questions. 

1)  Is DOC the kind of psychedelic that can offer deep psychological insights?

2)  Is it fun just to explore the DOC experience?  Does it offer good visuals?  Does it enhance creativity and the imagination?  Does it enhance the ability to visualize or mentally image something from imagination or memory? enhance Kundalini yoga practice?

3)  From reading Shulgin's brief report on it, I've learned that 1.5 - 3.0 or so mg DOC lasts about 20 hours.  That's a long time to set aside.  So if I were to take it but got bored with the trip after 4 or 5 hours, would I be able to sleep? to read a book? go mountain biking? or to work on that computer science project, for example?

In response to your questions, socko:


1) Yes, it is for sure.  However, personally I've found it to be a "noisy" psychedelic, in that it provides you with so much visual and aural stimulation that it makes it difficult to concentrate.  It also contains quite a bit of mind fuck at 3.5-4mg, which is also where it starts to get profound.  The result is that I've not yet determined how to really let myself go during the experience after about 5 or 6 trips with it.  I've often ended up getting stuck in a loop of doing the same things over and over again, stuck on the same minute of the clock for seemingly the majority of the peak.  But DOC is really, really powerful, and I think it allows you to connect with your subconscious/unconscious mind very easily if you can work out how, which is the same as the universal consciousness.  it doesn't seem to deal with personal issues much like I find the 2Cs to do.  At least this has been my experience. 


2) Yes, the state is quite fun to explore.  it's shockingly intense, while remaining pretty emotionally steady and non-scary.  I've had great trips that ended up being primarily recreational, just because the body high feels pretty good, not too stimulating (though definitely stimulating), and the visual effects are tremendous.  Also keep in mind that, for me, it took until the 4th trial to really fully be able to enter the state.  That trial was with 4mg and was the first really hard trip I had on it.  From then on, each new trip has picked up where the last one left off, and it's gotten more and more intense and serious and deep each time.  Also, it only takes me 3mg now to get to at least the same level that the 4mg trip got me to.


3) Definitely, absolutely not at 4 or 5 hours!  it builds pretty quickly, and I'm usually starting to peak by 2 hours or just after, but the peak reaches a peak at about 5-6 hours at which point I'm fairly incapacitated, and frankly unable to be bored, due to the intense psychedelic stimulation and mindfuck.  After about 8 hours I can sometimes fall into a sleeplike trance which definitely isn't full sleep (as I usually take it at around 11 at night), and then the whole next day I'm lightly tripping.  I go back down to a +2 at about T+8 to 10, and ride that out until about T+16, and then I'll be at a +1 again until I actually sleep, no matter how long that is (it's been up to T+30 after ingestion).  I personally really, really enjoy this day after light trip though, although some people find it annoying.  Once I reach a +2 I could go out and do stuff, but there's a fair amount of pupil dilation and paranoia when in public.  During the day, the visuals from DOC while outside are miraculous and truly beautiful beyond words.  I've driven at T+10 before but I don't recommend it, although I ended up driving for about 3 hours into the mountains.


DOC is one of my all-time favorite psychedelics, but in my opinion it's difficult to use constructively, and in fact I've not yet figured out exactly how to do so.  Although I have made progress.  You can search for my posted experiences in Trip Reports if you want, as I think they illustrate the experience that I have on it pretty well.

I agree DOC seems to .... each time you take it, almost seems to start where the last trip left off.  It DOES really tune you into the collective unconscious.  When everything around you seems like a fully automated software program, and every person you talk to, it seems like "nobody's home" / robotic, the world around you... the realisation that its like a giant 'software program', where everyone is enlightened and in perfect harmony/flow with the universe and the entire thing... is running to enlighten YOU... its pretty damn enlightening.  


I had a ++++ the last time, ... i thought "I" was pretty 'enlightened' compared to most, suddenly it was flipped, "I" was the DESIRE of the entire universe/program to be enlightened.. "IT" is all an illusion set up to teach me how to come merge with the program, learn how to go with the flow like everything else (permanent ego/self death eventually) and purely rely in intuition alone.

I sure hope it's peaked, for the sake of its continued legality and availability.  It seems to be quite popular already.  And I think this very thread has done a lot towards making it more widely available, unfortunately.  And by widely available, I mean to people who have decided it's a good thing to lay on blotter.  There have already been several news stories revealing DOC to the public, which unfortunately involved overdoses (not lethal) and sales.

It's legal, although it could be prosecuted under the Analogue Act since it's so similar to DOB and DOM.  But I've never heard of anyone being prosecuted for any of the "RCs" except for selling them.  In any case, even if it's not expressly illegal, no one in authority would look kindly on it.  And at the rate things are going... illegality is inevitable, I fear.  Just like with everything else.  I sometimes feel bad about talking about these psychedelics here online, because all it really does is spread the word.  But then again, the value of free and unbiased knowledge may just make it worth it.

It has already been mentioned in this thread and elsewhere in PD and there is a very comprehensive discussion of the various news coverage over in Media.  Apparently a reported friend of some of the persons involved replied to that [recent DOC / Blotter thread](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/showthread.php?t=259254).  I have yet to confirm all of the details with any eye-witness but I have been tracking all media developments related to this as it may lead to a US analog prosecution.

I am not certain of the inception part, but there is more than a name or two in the thread that I would be leery of doing such.  Nothing like generating an ‘Astroturf’ movement towards something.  But what is done is done, I just hope this one doesn’t ‘pull a DOM’ one of these days…  Because a few hundred kids at a rave doubling-up on 5 mg. pills would probably make headlines for about a year.

Definitely count me along in the old hippy camp ... DOC is one unpleasant ride. Baargh, the headaches. DOC brings it home alright but there's nicer ways of getting the message. Like sitting on a long long ride for ... er.... years... and you've seen it all and then there's this headache... where's the benzos. 2nd time DOC experience at 2mg. Ancestral, reptilian, it's totally brutal honest, doc is. Just so long. And it's really not that interesting...

I've only gotten DOC once, which i thought was acid at first. we didn't find out till a few days later that it was DOC. most unpleasant thing ever. We rolled with it, i took two pills and half of a tab. the roll was so strong and such a mind fuck, i was completely lost in my head for about three hours... then when the MDMA went away, the DOC was still going strong... horrifying. it was just sooooooooo strong, and not in a good way. and it lasted well into the next evening, which was awful when i was trying to sleep. it felt really dirty to me, mentally and physically... i felt like i was losing my mind because all that was running through my mind was incoherant babbling.

Have you tried low doses, like 1-1.5mg?  It reminds me of all-day-long MDMA with a much clearer head and an intense analytical edge, less "force", more energy, more control, and not at ALL pushy (due to the length).  At higher doses it really is nearly impossible to communicate or sometimes even think much at higher doses.

havent tried it yet but i would like to see what that would do.


DOI at 1mg is great for going to museums or a night out, and LSD is great at low doses too (hey, we even got a thread about it).

ill try it out sometime soon and report back with my findings.

thanks for the idea xorkoth 


MGS, after having tried nearly every RC commercially available one of my biggest regrets is having never tried 2ct7.

perhaps one day ill be lucky enough. I remember reading your trip reports on years ago, before i even knew about this wonderful psychedelic underworld.

Good theory, although from what I understand about DOI, I'd think that DOI would trigger it even worse (due to most people saying it's even more stimulant-like by far).  Personally, I've only done amphetamine drugs quite minimally but I've always really enjoyed them, which may be part of the reason I enjoy DOC so much.  It doesn't stimulate me much at all but the body buzz definitely reminds me heavily of amphetamine.

I'm a former speed freak too and I had a similar experience the first time I did DOC. But on the second trip, once I surrendered to this material, it wasn't like speed at all. A little stimulating, yes, but not like speed. YMMV.

I would imagine it would be safe... I think the DOXs are quite stable.  Just make sure it hasn't grown any organisms, and next time consider adding a small amount of ethyl alcohol to ward away contaminants.

I finally got around to trying this gem. I dosed 8mg in the form of blotters as my inital dose to start off one of my first (and subsequently last) experience at a psytrance festival. During the comeup there was some initial nausea which required me to set aside the san pedro ground cactii I was gelcapping in order to not become overwhelmed from the smell (this is quite common while coming up from anything for me). I find water usually from the tap to be alleviating to this nausea. 


The trip was actually very mild for me, I got all of the usual positive amphetamine-like effects with very little negative effects. I believe the only one I recall was while coming down my jaw was slightly moving uncontrollably but I never felt as if I was in any danger despite absolutely hating the music. The festival didn't turn out well mostly because it's not my "scene", I rather have music compliment rather than dominant whatever I am doing. The 8mg lasted from approximately 12 hours with a very smooth come down.


Despite it being very mild, it taught alot of valuable lessons that I have slowly begun to incorporate into my life. This is probably attributed to the setting and interacting with almost everyone I could run into. Someone on here described this effect as a sort of "social butterfly" which would sum it up quite well. There also seemed to be a period for about a week after the trip that I was not myself. I suppose there was a period of a week of integration for me personally.

I wonder if I might enjoy DOC more in a well and truly social (read: party/going out) setting than completely alone or with just one person. But I doubt such a high dose would be appropriate for me. I tripped balls on 2mg and would probably take 0.5mg for such an undertaking. 


Seems DOC really has different strength for different people... while some trip hard on 2mg, others can take over 8mg and find it mild. I am pretty sensitive to all psychedelics unless I have some tolerance, but I can go pretty high on 4-substituted tryptamines and some 2C's without feeling too uncomfortable. With DOC I don't even want to find out what a high dose would do to me. I'd be too afraid that the body issues I had when on it weren't psychosomatic (set related).

ive taken it once, and got a back massage at  a party (rave) and it was one of the most snynesthetic experiences of my life. After a while the trip got real old real fast and my muscles cramped up on me. I particuly enjoyed the come up and back massage. Since I have taken it i find no need to take it again, ill stick to my candy flips and Ketamines thank you much. Please try it before you judge it.

DOC is odd in its dose-reponse curve.  That curve varies for me with seemingly no consistency at all.  For example, this past Saturday morning I took 1.2mg and had an incredibly visual experience, consisting of long, detailed, fractallized tracers and a visual soup effect, as well as incredible color saturation, but with relatively little mental effects.  The highest I've taken it was 5mg, but that trip didn't approach the intensity of my 3.5mg trip which was my best one of all, loaded with ego-dissolving mental effects.  The one thing DOC always seems to give me is a powerful visual experience.  I've only had a few trips on anything that were more visual than my average DOC experience, and those were my two significant 2C-E trips, which were about equal but different, and n,n-DMT.  When I take it sparingly, with long breaks in between, it feels extremely emotionally and spiritually healing, and produces a state of complete contentment with living in the now for the next 36 or so hours.  It motivates me to be a better person, more honest with myself, and more motivated.  It brings about a massive joy that rivals MDMA except which is much less forced and much more real.  I sometimes get unpleasant amphetamine side effects, and sometimes I get none of those.  It seems rather random.  DOC also shifts my mind into a very piercing analytical state, where I just want to talk and talk and talk and analyze everything I see.  It makes it seem as if everything I do, whether it's important or as useless as watching crap TV, is very useful to my understanding of the world we live in.  This state usually emerges after the peak ends.  During the peak I'm generally rather overwhelmed and it's sometimes difficult to communicate.


Overall, it's still one of my absolute favorites.  I also find that taking it the morning after an LSD trip produces a more profound state.  I think sometime soon I'm going to try mixing it with something else after the peak ends.  Maybe smoke some DMT on it.  I also have a feeling that 2C-B would mix very well.


Another thing I've noticed is that the amphetamine body issues do not seem to significantly increase with a higher dosage, at least up to the level I've taken it to (5mg).  I get the same issues from 1mg as I do from 5, if I get them at all.

It would be ultra-sweet if it lasted 1/3 - 1/2 as long as it does. I don't have the time for all-day fry sessions with a 2nd day to recover very frequently these days.  Even if they winding-down phase were cut down I'd like it more. I love the effects, I just don't care for the duration.

Im rather upset i never got to experience the side of this drug that everyone seems to love so much.

My first couple experiences were great but the body load always overshadowed it.

I now just enjoy low dose (below 1mg).

Maybe i could try mixing it at alow dose with something like 2c-b (as xorkoth suggested) and see what happens.

I can't wait to try this one. Its been top of my list for months now. I guess the duration can really be a downside when you don't have much time for tripping. I have never tried any DOx compounds but I do remember LSD always overstaying its welcome when I just wanted to sleep. 


This seems to be one of the most common complaints with DOC (i.e its hard to sleep for a very long time after the trip wears off). I would think that a benzo would make sleep possible around hour 12-14  or so, although I wouldn't want to think what could happen during a DOC/benzo blackout. 


I don't have very much experience with benzos but 0.5mg of Xanax knocked me out amazingly after a recent 2C-I  experience. I was a bit tired in the morning but I feel like I slept VERY well. I find melatonin (which is normally great as a sleep aid) does not work at all on psychedelic comedowns. Perhaps this is because the same receptors are involved (melatonin being a tryptamine of course) and there is competition at the receptor site, or even some kind of cross-tolerance between tryptamines (although I would find this somewhat strange with melatonin)

with DOC i ate 2mg xanax and 1mg klonopin and drank tons of beer and still had a hard time falling asleep (although when i did i ended up pissing myself).

its better to just let it run its course.

Haha. That sucks man.


2mg xanax didn't put me to sleep either. It chilled me out a bit, and a drank a big bottle of 9% beer after the xanax had fully kicked in. In other trips, I'd taken more than that, and I've also tried klonpin and valium with little success. Valium normally makes me VERY relaxed and sleepy in a most pleasant way.

Personally I love its length, simply because I find it so pleasant.  Plus, after the first 5-6 hours I find it quite manageable, enough that I can function fairly normally, although I wouldn't want to drive.  I enjoy it at both low and high doses, although I've probably used it at a low dose (1-1.5mg) more times now than at high doses.

I found with DOC, it was possible to fall into a trance-like "sleep?" between 8 and 14 hours after eating the stuff. Actually on my largest dose (4-5mg) I fell asleep the soonest. Honestly I'm not sure if it was real sleep or some kind of dissociation, but I was tired as hell when I fell into it and felt very refreshed and ready for the next day when I snapped back to consciousness. Still tripping mildly too ... but just enough to make the day a little sparkly.


Xorkoth what effects do you experience around 1mg? I assume this is sub-psychedelic (or I should say, sub-visual?)... 


To me, the body-load does not get any worse between 2mg and 5mg.... it remains remarkably smooth. So that would not be a motivation for me to dose low... the motivation would be, I suppose, if it sounded worthwhile.


I have no plans to eat DOC ever again but I don't always go by my plans ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

Actually, at 1mg I often experience visuals, but not always.  It seems random.  This past Saturday I actually took 1.2mg and had very strong visuals, including morphing, particles appearing out of the air, and extreme fractallized trails.  It was actually quite shockingly and unexpectedly visual.  As for mental effects, it enhances my mood significantly and puts my mind into a highly analytical state, and makes me able to effortlessly live in the moment.


I also am able to "sleep" (more like trancing out) on DOC at any dose I've tried, after the peak ends.  I've even taken it at midnight and fallen into a trance by 6am.  Anytime I do this (take it at night), the entire next day is spent with a psychedelic amphetamine plateau/afterglow, which really makes the day fun and great and interesting.

Me too, on DOC even a double benzo dose doesn't knock me out even at theT+14 point... it'll quieten down but it'll still take 4 hours in the haze before I can let go.

This thread took me 5 hours to fix up!! I went back to the 40-page archived thread, and got a few straggling good posts out of there, and merged with the good posts from this thread, and here we are. 


I want to say, I am now officially sad, as a result of going back and re-reading that entire original DOC thread... I'm so glad the hysteria is over, and that I finally got the courage to make a decent DOC thread out of the wreckage.


I'm off to smoke a bowl and cheer up, now. Hopefully this thread is coherent, because I'm too tired to go back and read it for quality assurance...

I sort of mixed DOC with 2C-B, except probably not in the way you mean.  But in case it helps, I took LSD, then 2C-B 4 hours into it, and then about 4 hours or so after the 2C-B, I took 1.5mg of DOC.

Heh, nope, that report is fairly old. 


By the way, I'm going through all these recently pruned threads and adding a large purple notice at the post directly at the end of the pruned part of the thread, so that it will be easy to tell which parts are already pruned when it comes time to clean another chunk.  That, and it'll be easy for those who are looking back through to tell which parts are cleaned out.

**Finally!**


SO I finally managed to get some of this stuff. It seems to be perfect timing as well. My work schedule has changed from 6 days a week to 3 days on, 4 days off (yes I know, how lucky). I also have an ample supply of benzos (k-pin, xanax, valium), just in case things were to get out of hand and also some Risperdal M-Tabs, which are the ultimate safety net should some type of major crisis or emergency occur. I don't plan on using these things, its mostly for the piece of mind that I could.


I have around 30mg of DOC, which I plan to weigh multiple times on my American Weigh (JP Precision) milligram scale (not the best) and then dissolve in 60ml of vodka. Which means 0.5mg/ml and with a 1ml graduated pipette, I should be able to dose fairly accurately. I just went to the chemistry store and got some amber glass vials, a few 30ml measuring cups and some 1ml pipettes. I believe this should be everything I need (I've never done any serious liquid measurements before). Is vodka a good choice for DOC (and store in the freezer), or is there any advantage to distilled water?


I've never done a DOx compound before so I plan on starting low, 2mg max. I am only 135lbs so that should be a good starting point, maybe even 1.5mg. I don't want to get sucked into any vortexes just yet, but at the same time I don't want to be underwhelmed.  I'm looking forward to a long trip, for some reason my trips always end up being short these days (I usually trip 3-4 times per month). 2C-B lasts 3-4 hours, 4-AcO-DMT 2-3 hours, and LSD 6 hours. 


I am extremely intrigued about the enhanced musical abilities people have been talking about. Music is my life, if I could actually write/record songs in the later stages of a DOC trip, it would be a blessing. 


I'll also be able to take some EEG and EKG measurements (for entertainment purposes only of course). I'm particularly interested in DOC's effects on frontal lobe gamma amplitude/coherence and also Internal Cardiac Coherence/HRV. Frontal lobe gamma amplitude/coherence has recently been shown to be a correlate of 'higher states of consciousness' (in studies involving Tibetan monks) and I don't really think this has been looked at before in psychedelic studies. Should be fun nonetheless.

It has been much harder to find than other RC's, I just hope to experience it soon before it gets booted into Schedule I. I don't think my 20USD .001 scale is accurate enough to way the correct dosage, especially fractions of a mg.

eleveneleven:


I think 2mg is a good starting dose.  Have you taken any DOX substance before?  DOC is similar in character to the others, but gentler than DOB/DOI at least.  It's rather sedating, to me honest, and quite laid back, even when it becomes intense.  In that way it reminds me somewhat of 4-AcO-DMT, in that everything around you could be melting and distorted, but mentally you're fairly lucid and calm.  However, it's rougher than 4-AcO-DMT for sure.  If you've never taken a DOX, I'd start at 1.5mg, which will be psychedelic but less so than 2mg, for sure.  Any less than 1.5mg will probably produce a sub-tripping state which will be annoying after a while, as it lasts for so many hours.  After I had learned DOC's language, I used .5 - 1.25mg doses as day enhancers a few times and enjoyed it very much, but the first try I attempted was with 1.2mg and it gave me a negative vibe for a while because I got so tired of it.  Also, vodka would be fine for DOC, yes.  Your liquid measurement plan sounds just fine.


Something I experienced with DOC, which may have been due to my experience at the time or other factors, was that the first few times I took it I found it very enjoyable and shocking, but impossible to really use.  For it to reveal its usefulness to me, I had to somehow keep focused during the come-up and beginning peak, or else I would enter what I termed "the divine delerium", where I basically sat around listening to music and experiencing bizarre consciousness phenomena and seemingly reptilian contact which was creepy, while my ego/consciousness was relatively unable to actually assert any sort of control or desire for control.  A strange state which I enjoyed but which I could not figure out how to break through.


Then one time, I discovered a way to keep my mind active.  I believe I came on Bluelight during the come-up and read and responded to posts.  I noticed that time that my mind was able to stay pretty lucid, and I realized that the repitilian consciousness was really my subconsciousness, which I accessed and ended up having an immensely healing and instructive trip.  That's the best way I can explain it.  That was with 3.2mg.


I find DOC to be focused very much on primordial genetic roots and evolutionary material.  it's very "archetypal".  It's really a great substance, one of my favorites.  There's a certain element of euphoria, but it differs from the euphoria of the likes of AMT and 4-AcO-DMT, and that produced by non-amphetamine psychedelic phenethylamines.  It's sort of detached euphoria, with little outright joy.  The exception to this was my healing trip I mentioned above.  During the few hours I was listening to music with my eyes closed, laying down, my soul was just soaring.  It was beautiful.


Music really is enhanced by DOC.  It's as if you can hear the entire song as a cohesive whole, while simultaneously analyzing its separate elements apart from the whole.  Enjoy!

*update*

I would just like to report that I think I may have completely screwed up my liquid measurement plan. It turns out I have around 40mg of DOC and not the 30mg I was supposed to get. I am not complaining about that part. I would like to add that it is IMPOSSIBLE TO EYEBALL THIS STUFF. When I first saw how much was in the bag, I thought it looked more like 15-20mg based on my previous experience with other research chemicals.


So here is my problem. I put the ~40mg of DOC into the amber vial and then went to measure the vodka in a 30ml measuring cup (my original plan was 30mg of DOC into 60mg vodka for a 2ml/mg solution) and when I went to put the 30ml of vodka in the vial, an unknown amount spilled (I would guess maybe 5ml)8( . I then measured an additional 15ml of vodka which went in fine. I should have approximately 40mg of DOC dissolved in approximately 40ml of Vodka. 


Does anyone have any suggestions on how to improve this situation? I was thinking of transferring the liquid from the amber vial to another using a syringe and measure it that way and assume a larger margin of error in my solution.


One other question. I was planning on using latex gloves but they proved too cumbersome and my finger did come in contact with a small about of crystals, which I wiped off. I certainly didn't 'pull a Green Barts' and lick my finger or anything, but is it possible I may have 'pulled a Hoffman' and absorbed enough through my finger to trip? I guess time will tell, in the meantime I will skip my regular dose of piracetam just in case...  ![8o](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eek.gif) 


I could imagine piracetam could have very synergistic (and perhaps completely unpredictable) effects with DOC. Does anyone have any experience with this? I think 800mg of piracetam and maybe 250ug of DOC could be an interesting experiment.


I also saved a little bit of the crystals, as I am intrigued about the reports of people vaporizing DOC, is there any more/new information on that Meth-OD of ingestion?


thanks

Hmm... I would have re-measured the entire amount of vodka after the spill.  But too late for that now, I guess, huh?


I would assume that what you have it correct and start low.  Be aware that DOC seems quite safe for a DOx and if you're off by even 100% (which I can't imagine you would be close to), you would be fine (although perhaps freaked out!) by a normal dose.


I'm not sure what else to suggest except letting all the vodka dissolve out of the container, and then pouring a new, accurate amount in.  


I have mixed piracetam and DOC close together once, but technically far enough away (3 hours) that it may have had no effect anyway.  In any case, I didn't really notice anything different about the trip except that it was more mentally focused.  I have a hunch (not proof!) that the DOx class is not affected in the same way by piracetam as the 2C-X class, for example (which is affected very strongly in my experience).


If you want to try it, starting with 250ug or so would be a good start.


And I don't think that DOxs absorb through the skin.  I could be wrong though.  I've gotten doc powder on my finger, wiped/washed it off (not immediately), and never felt any effects.

thank you very much for this (and your previous) reply. The spill happened on the way into the bottle, so I just had to keep pouring. I think I have things under control, I just should have practiced my technique with something not so rare and potent. I will simply pour the solution from the amber vial into the 30mg measuring cups and then put it back in with the 10ml medicine syringe I have. That should get me within 1ml or so.


As piracetam seems to interact with MDMA and amphetamines I would think the potential would be there for DOC as well. But since the DOx class seems to first accumulate in the lung, where some unknown metabolic process may occur, its over simplistic on my part to assume that because piracetam interacts with *amphetamine, that is will also interact with DOC specifically. I think to test if there is any interaction it would be best to take the piracetam after the DOC, to account for the conversion/accumulation time in the lung before the substance starts to show activity. I think around 250-500ug there could be great nootropic potential.


I'm very glad (but also somewhat disappointed) that my prospects of tripping on an unknown amount of transdermally absorbed DOC this afternoon are pretty low. I do feel something, but nothing that I couldn't attribute to the 500mg capsule of DL-phenylalanine I took, coupled with the placebo effect. If the walls start breathing, then I'll take notice.![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


*edit*

SO I must not have lost much after all. I measured 45ml of solution from the vial and there was around 7ml of vodka left from the stated 50ml bottle so I must be pretty close. The dosage concentration should be 0.888mg/ml, so to be on the safe side I will assume a 1:1 ratio. My first trial on Wednesday will use 2ml or ~1.8mg, which I feel is a good compromise between 1.5-2 for a DOx virgin.

After having had a number of incredibly psychedelic and confusing acid-like trips on DOC a while back, complete with amphetamine side-effects (weak ones, but there nonetheless), I now find it to be quite nootropic indeed, and much gentler, with practically nothing amphetamine-related going on in the body except a desire to stay awake for a very long time.  Last time I used it (Saturday night), I took 3.6mg, then 1.5mg 3 hours later.  I stayed up all night, all the next day, and until about 2am last night, with an absolutely racing and whirring mind.  Considering that I get pleasure and saatisfaciton from feeling mentally quick and analytical, it was a great experience indeed!  I felt that it made the flow of words effortless, though somewhat stream-of-consciousness, and I could not help but analyze absolutely everything I saw or experienced.  Just thinking about my weekend has made me near to tears all day, simply because it was so wonderful and bonding for my fiance and cats and I.


Enjoy DOC!  I don't know why, but at first I found it very difficult to get anything from.  I would have these trips where I felt almost taken over by my subconsciousness, and I would be swimming in a bowl of dramatic visual soup all night, the time seeming to snap by and stop at the same time.  I would spend hours staring at something over and over, seeming to communicate with something but without any control over it.


Then I had one trip on it which was also extraordinarily visual and mentally deep, but this one was lucid and crystal-clear and was my best DOC trip.  Since then, I've only used it twice (over 5-6 months), but both times it has been much weaker, not very visual, required a higher dose, and totally mentally lucid and quick.


Actually, any post I made on Bluelight Saturday night or Sunday was while on DOC.  I may go b ack and try to read them to see if my perception of my mental lucidity was true, or a delusion ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

Last time I used DOC, this past weekend, I had a wonderful trip (I'm planning on writing it up), but I noticed an alarming side effect for the first time: extreme vasoconstriction.  It especially affected my large leg arteries (veins?), and I was unable to stretch my legs all the way out.  My veins in the legs felt like they were so constricted that they'd snap if my legs extended all the way.  When I sat with my legs crossed, I couldn't tell, but walking required hobbling until I'd been doing it for a few minutes, at which point it seemed to stretch them out somewhat.


It was still a great trip with no other side effects, but it alarmed me a bit, especially because it was that strong at T+1:00.  Fortunately, it didn't get worse, but instead got better with time.  it's just odd because I've never gotten more vasoconstriction than a slight bit of pain after just standing up, and I've taken larger doses.

Your not the only one a lot of people I've talked to who use DOC have this including me.I've had it so bad it was actually painful but only lasts 5-15 minutes to that degree usually.Never had the leg thing that would be enough to keep me away from DOC for a week or so![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

Yeah, my legs hurt for hours.  Actually, the next day (I took it in the evening the night before), it would come back to a minor degree from time to time.  Before this experience, DOC either gave me no perceived vasoconstriction at all, or just enough to feel like a low dose of LSAs sort of, slight pain when standing up after sitting for a while and so forth.  This past time it hurt alarmingly, to the point where I was afraid to walk, for the entire night.  I would have to stand very slowly, hold myself up, and do light stretches in order to be able to hobble like Quasimodo across the room.


Other than that, the trip was wonderful, euphoric, and had a great body high.

that is a state I have been actively working away from in recent years. i try to quieten my mind rather than to indulge its fickleness. i can't say psychedelics help me quieten my mind while I am under the influence, but on the whole I think their long-term effect has been a quietening one, due to the insight into my thought processes they allowed me to have - thereby giving the mechanisms less power to overwhelm me. my mind is naturally all over the place and i make efforts to quieten it, as i feel better this way.

^^ I agree, actually.  Long-term, in my everyday life my mind is very calm at most times, which I attribute in large part to my psychedelic experiences.  I very much enjoy the racing mind aspect of psychedelic during the experiences, though.  I like making connections and thinking deeply, almost automatically, about whatever I'm paying attention to.  They don't all do that, but DOC does.  LSD and mushrooms are two others that have this effect dramatically.

DOC is AMAZING I would suggest you give it a go.Nothing has managed to put me at peace like DOC.Watching the sun come up as the trip nears it's end I feel as though I could explode with positivity.MDMA has nothing on it.Still have DOM to look forward to though.

I haven't ruled it out, it just slipped behind about 10 other substances that I want to try, after DOM came to me.

I concur about DOC.  DOM has given me more analytical and ragingly psychedelic experiences, but DOC invokes a sense of peace and serenity that I've not matched with anything else that it just wonderful.  And the peak is intense and psychoanalytical as well, just not to the same extent and clarity as DOM.


Oh, and LysergicWindow, thanks for the report!  Would you mind posting it in Trip Reports as well (another forum here at Bluelight)?  Also, did you mean D-*iso*lysergic acid diethylamide?  Because that's different from LSD, and in the case that you really meant D-iso-L, then that's very interesting as I've never heard of another report of that substance.

DOC is definetly worth trying.

I have tried DOI and DOB as well, but DOC is far supierer than the other two.


I have also grown more fond of DOC than 2ce and lsd after sampling it.


Dont know how many times i have done DOC, Probably around 15-20, but it seems like the more i use it the more it reveals itself to me.

DOC + MDMA is a great combonation.

And i want to try a Ketamine+DOC combo, as i read that amphetamine like compunds allow you to remmeber your expierence better, and on Ketamine I get really bad memory after going into a K hole. PLus the combo will most likely catapult me into cosmic space.

Hey everyone! My first post in nearly a year, 's been a while.


This is getting off-topic (bromo-dragonfly vs LSD), but I have to concur with those who say DOC is more than worth trying. I have tripped dozens - hundreds? - of times, on almost everything out there; I am someone who considers psychedelics an important part of my life; and yet I can safely say the only truly life-altering experiences I've had were with three: LSD, DOC and DMT+DPT. 


I could not ever rank the three; they each showed me God, The Universe and Everything in their own ineffable way. But DOC was by far the most spiritual. I spent the better part of 24 hours on DOC weeping and groveling into a dishtowel like an elderly widow, shuddering before the awesome power of God (or whatever you choose to call that Big Thing). 


I'm not a Christian, nor do I proclaim any religious affiliation, but my own nickname for DOC, coined during one of my more lucid moments under its spell, is "Died On a Cross". I felt I could finally understand, to my absolute core, what true spiritual enlightenment was -- and happened to have been reading a bit of Judeo-Christian religious history that week, so there you go. 


But honestly, it all comes down to set and setting doesn't it. I could probably have had the same experience on half a dozen other chemicals, under similar circumstances.

Great post and welcome back!


Although DOC was not my most profound trip, it ranked among the top 4 or 5 for sure.  I didn't have a +4 on it (the 3 in which I did, mushrooms, 2C-E and 4-AcO-DMT, are my top 3), but DOC has given me amazing experiences, and I think if I get the chance to take it in an optimal setting like camping on a mountain with good friends or something, it could easily have the potential for such an experience.  Nonetheless, it has still helped me a lot on several occasions and I love it dearly.  I think DOM has the same potential if not more, but the thing about DOC that it wonderful (among other things), is the profound and beautiful sense of sublime peace and joy it instills, especially after the peak and for the next 24 hours or so.

Question..  The first psychedelic I ever tried was DOC...  I've done it quite a bit and I loved every single trip I've had on it.  Then one day, I was introduced to LSD.  I had done that a few times and had quite a few mind blowing trips on it and hadn't touched DOC ever since..until the other night.  I ingested 2mg (which used to be a good dose for me) and it was awful.  I didn't trip that hard at all and I ended up disappointed.  Could it be that since I tried LSD and it rocked my world that I won't get anything out of DOC anymore, or did I just not take a high enough dose?  I'd like to give it another try with a higher dose but I'm almost scared I'll have a bad experience again.


I've learned a lot from DOC and even had a healing experience with 4mg one time, so I don't want it to end like this...

Whats a good dose for someone who is relatively experienced with psychedelics?


I've had experience with LSD,AMT,DOM,Salvia,LSA, and MDA.


Just don't want to take a dose too low and be dissapointed.

I would go for 3mg personally.  Well, first try a very small dose, like .25mg or something, to see if you would react badly.  Then assuming not, go for 3.  2 is a good experience but I found 3 more comfortable and "complete".


I agree though, you wouldn't be disappointed with 2mg - it's powerful also.  But I just think you'll more enjoy 3mg.

my first dose was 4mg.

while 2mg you will get psychedelic effects from DOC, i think at doses over 5mg DOC will take you to another level.

I have tried doses at 7mg and over and it was a +++.

DOC is very astrological sensed for me


start low and find your sweet spot

Is it just me or has DOC fallen "off the radar" significantly lately? Don't get me wrong, this is probably a good thing after all the hype in 2005-2006 but I'm just wondering if people have changed their opinion of it in hindsight?


As for the "astrological sense", I tend to agree, but probably in a different context. I notice my "spiritual energy", "prana" etc. seems to ebb and flow yearly with the solar cycle (peaking around the summer solstice) and my only experience with DOC was ~1.8mg in the spring. I found it uncomfortably stimulating and very electric if that makes sense. It felt a bit as though there was a current of electricity between my joints and it was difficult to get comfortable. The psychedelic effects were pretty minimal and I ended up taking Valium and going to sleep around t +12. I have limited experience with stimulants so I may not have the correct vocabulary to explain myself properly.


Now that its fall and things are starting to wane, I think something a bit stimulating could be useful and I've been contemplating taking DOC again for a while. After a recent mild LSD trip I really enjoyed the length and especially the slow decline.


I think previously my DOCe might have been a bit low so I never really got passed the stimulating qualities. I'd like to try 3mg shortly and see how that works out.


Does anyone know about degradation? I've had my DOC stored in an amber vial dissolved in vodka in the freezer for over 6 months, should I expect any noticeable loss of potency?

I agree with illusion that DOC feels "astrological".  It's very classically psychedelic, strong, very strong.


My early trials with it were simply fantastic.  For quite a while though it's been much less dramatically psychedelic, and just provided a strongly empathogenic, more weakly psychedelic experience that gives me vasoconstriction.  I suppose this is mostly due to my long-term tolerance which I suspect will be a while to dissipate.  But I wonder if anyone else has experienced the same?


Finally, e1, 1.8mg is going to be a different sort of beast than 2.5-3.5mg.  I'd go for 3, personally.  As long as you're sure you could handle it if it turned out to be too stimulating again (not enjoy, but handle, not freak out).  But personally I find full doses of DOC to be rather relaxing, not stimulating.  My 1.2mg dose of DOC, the first one, was very stimulating, however.  Over the summer, I took several doses of DOC in the 4-5mg range to spend a day with my family and friends in a lakehouse, nortern-Wisconsin paradise.  It was great, just great.  But had I taken that much before, Id've been completely out of commission until about T+10, when the second stage hit.  In fact, now that I mention the "second stage" of DOC, it has seemed every time I've taken in within the past half a year or so the experience has been entirely composed of that second stage, the euphoric, empathogenic, social part.


And from what I understand, DOX substances are extremely stable, like other amphetamines.  I doubt you've experienced degradation.  And also, for what it's worth, the last of the "old kind of trip" that I've gotten from DOC was the last dose I took of the first batch I received.  This batch came as a small collection of small crystals, not as powder, and every experience with it was powerfully deep and psychedelic.  My other DOC has all been of a different appearance, as a whitish-clear powder made of really tiny shards.

Thanks for the thoughtful response. 


I used to notice a similar feeling with AMT to a lesser degree, but over time the stimulation has become much more tolerable so hopefully some of that translates over to DOC.


If things got really unbearable I'd take some valium or K-pin to help with the physical side effects. I'd imagine a small dose could provide some physical relief and mental calm without detracting too much from the experience. As for a total "freak out", while highly unlikely, its been a quiet, yet constant concern in the back of my mind when it comes to amphetamine psychedelics. Now that I have some Risperdal that fear is significantly lessened as I feel more confident in my ability to handle "the absolute worst case scenario" should it ever arise.


Also the DOC I got is a very fine crystal, not a powder and I think its from the earlier batches as I got it during the period when DOC was unavailable for the most part.

^^ Sounds like the first batch I got, unfortunately only 100mg then.  I had some overwhelmingly intense (but in a very good way) trips on 3-4mg of that stuff... even using it for months in a row once a week, every experience was very strong, extremely visual and powerful and archetypal.  it's a very easy strong trip to handle... DOM was much more abrasive.  Most things are, in fact.


You should feel lucky, then... I just thought that batch (if it is indeed the sa,me one) was simply better.  So yeah, definitely go for 3mg.  My strongest experience with it was with 3.5mg, but I went up to 4.5mg.

Another side note is that during around the time I took the first dose I had also been taking l-tyrosine and DLPA, both likely to enhance stimulation.


One thing I've found to be helpful lately and may be useful with stimulating drugs such as DOC is Taurine. Many people think its in energy drinks because its stimulating, but actually the opposite is true. As a vegan I'm likely a little low in taurine so I could possibly benefit from supplementation in the days prior to taking DOC. I also have a calming amino acid blend with B vitamins, magnesium, taurine, GABA and Valerian, which I'll likely take a few hours before.


I'll also be able to test my hypothesis that a small dose of ketamine, similar to that used in the anti-depressant research would be a good way to ensure a positive mood going into the experience and a less stressful come-up.

It is already known that stress floods the brain with glutamate, says Zarate. “It might be that these neurons are struggling to regulate glutamate, and if you stress them over and over, they become injured.” This hypothesis is still very new7. There is some evidence linking glutamate, and the NMDA receptor, to depression. Twenty-five years ago, for instance, scientists at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases in Bethesda, Maryland, showed that chemicals that target the NMDA receptor have antidepressant effects in animals8. Scientists have since found that deceased depressed human patients, such as suicide victims, have abnormal numbers of NMDA receptors. And brain-imaging studies have found that depressed people have much higher levels of glutamate in one region of their brains than healthy people9.

While there is not enough evidence to extrapolate a complete pharmacodynamics for each individual psychoactive substance we are discussing (remember every compound is unique), there is enough research done to generally get an idea of what receptor subtypes they are acting on.


In the case of DOC it is a full agonist at 5HT2a and 5HT2c receptors (serotonin receptors). It causes postsynpatic changes by binding to the receptor and changing the flow of information in your brain.

Just to add my experiences to the mix. My most memorable experience with it was a 5mg dose of DOC diluted in ethanol on an empty stomach. The come-up was suprisingly fast since 30-45 min in I was already tripping. The rest of the trip was a magical blur. At its peak I was at an intense +++ for two solid hours. The amphetamine like kick and euphoria was very clean and mellow (which is a rarity for me with psychedelics) and the visual were absolutely amazing. I was almost down about 12 hours after dosing.


As far as the mental activity, i found it very comparable to the maelstrom of confusion and profound insight that comes with shrooms, acid, and other of the more heady psychedelics.

I took 1.5 mg of DOC with a friend ( he took the same dose ) and we sat around for 3 hours. We got bored after 3 hours of nothing, so we smoked a couple joints and bowls.


 Well I started to freak out about 30 minutes later. I started laughing uncontrollably, then my friend went outside and I got super paranoid, and every little noise was like I was in Hell. I totally freaked out, and won't do "DOC" again.

**After effects of DOC?**


recently I have taken 2 mg of DOC, and it was a pretty much eneventful trip, 2 mg definately wasnt worth it, I should have taken more..but either way, I went about my day pretty much like normol, but at the end of the day when all the visuals left, I found that I started to feel really crappy, and then all of a sudden I was extremely depressed, I even contemplated suicide, which is not normol for me, I dont know if it was from the crash from DOC or what, and I was wondering if anyone else ever had a similar expiriance....

I took DOC about 250 times from .25 to 10mg, and no I never got these effects.  I've never even heard about that and I have shared it with about 14 people at one time or another.

My first question would be what other drugs you may be taking, including, SSRI's etc. Prior experience with psychedelics and your state of mind (set) before hand can be major factors as well.


Sometimes what can happen, especially with lower doses is that uncomfortable, unconscious material can surface but the dose isn't high enough to 'transcend' that stage and you end up spending a lot of time wallowing in your problems. In the context of psychedelic therapy this can be therapeutic and even desired, but if you are simply looking to 'trip out' and can be quite undesirable.


I've only taken DOC once at 1.8mg and it was similarly uneventful. I didn't experience any depression though.


For the time being, I'd lay off psychedelics and take some time to integrate the experience.


Some great information on handling difficult experiences and general tips for using psychedelics wisely can be found [here](http://www.erowid.org/psychoactives/writings/stolaroff_using.shtml). You may find it helpful

That may be true...it was wierd cause all of a sudden everything seemed so much worse than it was. Maybe I just had a bad day and I just happened to associate it with the DOC, I plan on trying it again at 4 mg, instead of the 2, but I was also wondering if 4 mg was a good dose, like if it would really greatly increase from uneventful trip, to a intense trip, or would I have to take more?

If it makes you contemplate suicide maybe you should just find another drug? Or possibly take a break from drugs? ![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif) 


A friend of mine tried it a couple times and quit just because it was long, slightly exhausting, and not eventful or fantastic enough to justify further use. But I wouldn't expect it to have any particularly nasty long-term after-effects, when taken at normal doses.

**Doc**


I have been coming across this stuff a lot more in the past year or so and have eaten my share.  Does anyone else have any experience with it? My trips have been full of intense audio halluc.,LSD-like visuals--  but I was suprised how clear my head was throughout all of them.  Ive never had the absolutely ridiculous thoughts a hard acid/shroom trip will give me from DOC, but that can be seen as a positive as well I suppose.  The DURATION of this stuff is absolutely amazing.  The duration almost kind of knocks it out of regular recreational use, for me at least.  I question I had about it is the form that it comes in.  When I get some its always on blotter paper but a friend said that it actually comes in crystallized form but they put it on blotter to make it easier too distribute. Any info on this?

I always find the long tail end of DOC (lasts from about T+10 to T+24 or even 36) makes me feel absolutely amazing... it's my favorite part of the drug.  Then it drops off and I feel fine, maybe better than fine, although a bit tired.  Once, I took DOC for 5 days in a row, and by the end, I was worn out and entered a bit of a depression.  But that's to be expected at that level of use.

I'm getting a g of the doc here in a few.  I am wondering how this substance goes with sex.  I usually experiment with my girlfriend.  Amt is good for sex, 4-aco-dmt is good but cant ever get off.  Also is it better to take it sublingulily or orally?  What about insufflation?  Thanks.....

I've been using this recently (from a relatively recent batch) as a low-dose supplement to my day, sub-psychedelic.  At this dose it is free of any side effects and gives me about 6-8 hours of serious nootropic augmentation, speed of thought, motivation, and drive to categorize and optimize my processes.  Then it begins to shift into the laid-back, euphoric and talkative stage for the rest of the day, which is fantastic.  I have taken such a dose 3 times this week, on Monday, Wednesday, and today.


I've been very loaded down at work lately so I took low doses on those days at about 7:30am before work.  It worked absolutely fantastically.  it provided me with a very nice body buzz and energy without any sort of overstimulation at all.  it gave me motivation and a desire to communicate with my fellow employees, whom I normally try to avoid as much as possible.  Basically it has turned a really hectic week into an enjoyably intense week which I am about to receive two awards for doing such fast and efficient work.


On those days, later on after work I end up spending the whole evening and night with my fiance, having a blast and just laughing a lot and feeling the love very deeply.  It has been one of the best weeks I've had in a while.  And our kitties have been sleeping in the bed with us which they do not normally do, and being even extra snuggly (they are always snuggly but this is ridiculous) ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif).  I attribute it to my radiation of an aura of peacefulness and joy.

.5 to 2mg.  Given that I am not as sensitive to psychedelics as I once was.  I may have found it a bit more distracting two years ago, as I used to get more side effects from things.   I would recommend others to try it at .25 to .5mg to start... try to get to a level in which you are only subtly altered, not outright under the effects of the drug.  At the level I am talking about there are no visuals


Also, I should mention I have been well able to sleep each night by midnight, although I also think I could have stayed up all night had I wanted to.

So does doc cause any preformance problems?  Also did anyone try the massive amounts of geltabs around in the late 90's?  Alot of those had a bitter/chemical taste, but lasted about 12-16 hours and where very visual, could those of been dox chemicals?

**Denatured alcohol capable of eating away DOC???**


I dilluted some DOC in denatured pharmacy alcohol that contained a 0,2% of Diethyl Phthalate. I'm afraid this stuff

might eat  the DOC in some way or the other (apparently it can eat

plastic and is cancerigenous. What should I do? Did I fuck up? If

not, could I let this solution evaporate and re-mix with distilled

H2O (this would also get rid of the DP), or this prolonged exposure

of the DOC to the air would keep on degrading it? Or just leave it

the fuck alone and stop asking for problems... I have stored MDMA

in another brand of denatured pharmacy alcohol and it didn't go

bad, even though it wasn't even stored away from light and heat,

but maybe it had another additive.

Thanks!

^^ A little bit.  I'm afraid you'd just have to try it out in a safe environment and determine what dosage would work for you, because DOC can vary in dose and effect between people.

Question:  why did you dissolve any chemicals in denatured alcohol rather than alcohol that you knew was safe?  I would recommend ethyl alcohol, even dissolving it in vodka or something if everclear (nearly pure alcohol) is not available where you are.  I'd use isopropyl alcohol next, as it will evaporate totally and shouldn't contain other things.  Isopropyl alcohol is dirt cheap as well.


Unfortunately I don't know how to answer your question though.  If everything in this alcohol blend evaporates completely, you should be able to evaporate and scrape up the crystals.  If not, you'll have to find some way to remove the poisonous stuff, and be damn sure you got it all.


Finally, regarding DOC's stability... it is a very stable molecule, as amphetamines tend to be.  It could be exposed to air for a long time and be fine.  Stored as crystals or in liquid in a cold, dark place, it would last for years... possibly much longer.

I was used to dissolve my chemicals in pharmacy alcohol, and I didn't take they would change the composition between brands, pharmacy alcohol is usually what you would call Isopropyl alcohol. Have done this before with a variety of other chems with no ill effects, I guess I should have been a better observer at the moment.


I have read that Diethyl Phtalate doesn't dissolve in water. So, I would just evaporate the alcohol in a surface and rre-mix the crystal DOC with distilled water. Only one person has complained about the alcohol and got GI disturbances, but he drank the mixture while the alcohol was still evaporating. How much would I lose this way anyway, by evaporating? I guess not so much but something has to be lost. Thanks for answering so completely, bye.

What's up with this stuff, recently aquired some from a reliable source.  Took 2mg then 1mg 2 hours later and barely felt anything.  How much is a good dose, usually 15mg to 25mg is good for 4-aco-dmt.  I thought this stuff was supposed to be very active above 2mg.  How much should I take?

Maybe your source isn't so reliable?


Also, how often do you trip?  have you tripped recently?  Have you used any other DOXs or AMT recently?  Tolerance may be an issue if so.

I hadn't tripped in a couple weeks and it was with tryptamines such as 4-ho-mipt, amt, 4-ho-dmt, 4-aco-dmt, and amt when I had tripped.  *[Source discussion removed]*  Thanks

I found 2.5mg to be within the range of a full experience. See my trip report on Erowid's DOC vault for more info.


Of note is that the compound was bought from a vendor with a very good reputation that provided GS/MS with all batches of materials. 2 years later and the stuff is still brilliant white, diamond-like crystals, not powder.

^^ I have seen it where it was made into a powder... it may be difficult to tell, but is it a dull white powder (like powdered 2C-Xs for example) or is the powder shiny to some extent?  Powdered DOC forms a dense, shiny powdeer because the crystals are brilliant white, shiny crystalline structures.  In contrast, crystals of the 2C-X class that I've seen are almost like flakes... their appearance is totally different, not at all like shiny, needle-like crystals.


And yeah... don't snort it.  Oral works very well and is a lot less potentially dangerous.

Then perhaps it's fully powdered.  I have seen some that is nearly powder but with tiny crystals left.  My guess is that it is DOC, but why don't you take ~1mg and find out.  If it has an effect, it's probably DOC (or some DOX at least).

Question:  how much do you trip on other things?  How much psychedelic tolerance do you have in general?  I ask because whenever I have a large psychedelic tolerance from tripping too often, DOC can require a higher dose and doesn't really give any visual changes at even large (but reasonable) doses.  It becomes more of a mood and thought stimulator.

O.k. here's an update from last night. @ 2:30 am took 3mg.  By 4:30 still no visual changes.  Fell a sleep at 4:30 am, woke up at 6am to pee and still no visuals.  I can handle very large amounts of entheogens, but at the same time I have tripped so much that I am very sensitive and usually notice visual changes even in thresh hold doses.  I am able to get visuals from 10mg 4-aco-dmt, the last time I tripped was 2 weeks ago and it was 12-14mg 4-ho-mipt and I had nice, but not overwhelming visuals.  Prior to that I hadn't tripped in over a month or two.  And thats was mostly 4-ho-dmt and AMT, but not more that twice a week.  Even when I would trip more than once a week I noticed stronger visuals than I got from 6-7mg doc last night.


Thanks...

I recently experienced DOC at 2,0mg and 3,5 mg.  Both were highly visual, but with little head fuck.  At 3,5 the synthesia was AMAZING.  I could hear and taste color, really really beautiful.


I found myself up and more active than usual, but not terribly hungry.  Although it was possible to eat and stay still in bed with my eyes closed.  Sleep was possible at the 18 hour point.


DOC is by far my favorite PEA.  Except for maybe Mescaline.

O.K. then should I complain to my source?  I have given this to two other friends one at 2mg with 2mg 2hours later then 3mg 3 hours after that.  It does something but not alot, no visuals.  Only a sedated trippy feeling...

I had some DOC that seemed that way.  I sat on it for a few months and tried it again, and it worked.  My only explanation is that DOC can be highly variable.

Were you able to sleep with no problem with doses above 5mg, this has been the case with more than one person.  Today I do feel a little out of it, but more like I took a benzo...  I wish I if anyone has received a batch like this in the last week or two.  This stuff has not caused any pupil dilation in all three test subjects, at rather high doses for this substance(4-8mg)

I've never not felt anything under a milligram with out tolerance.I've seen a few people not feel it their first couple times but it worked in all the people I've taken it with after about their 3rd time.One person took  6mg their second time felt nothing then 2.5mg their 3rd & was completely blown away.

I have felt spacey all day but don't know if I'm still high or if it is an after affect from some other substace.  Maybe the thing about it taking a few times to work could be the case, but my friend took it twice oral and once snorted, tolerence could of played apart because first time was friday at 3mg, then saturday at 6mg.  Then yesterday(tuesday) snorted 8mg...

I'd say give it a while and then try again, at a higher dosage than the previous first time.  If it doesn't work then, then it must be watered down or something else.  But that spacey feeling all day happened the few times I got almost no effect from DOC.  The first time I had DOC, I was blown away... in fact, every time I took it from that first 100mg batch was fantastic.  That batch was a small collection of clear, glistening, solid crystals/  I've never seen it that nice since and it's never worked quite as well either.  Although I had much less experience with psychedelics then, too.

Another friend snorted 2mg and 2mg oral, with only slight effects.  If Doc does have certain times when it doesn't work on people, like the first two or three times.  Then it works later, from the same batch; could this have to do with hormones due to current lunar phases?  For instance the winter solstice began yesterday and continues for a couple days. The moon is also close to full.  The reason I'm asking is it almost seems like this might be 2c-c or something, but it would be dangerous to take doc at a dose anywhere near a dose for 2c-c. From what I've heard even the doses I've taken with little effects(6-8mg) can be quite scary...

I have felt like I've been mildly tripping for the last couple days, I've been getting these really weird trails when I look away from my computer screen or t.v.  The picture seems to stick in my new visual frame.  So the effects do seem long lasting, but dont know if it's me or if it's watered down.

Personally I think cosmic cycles can have a profound effect on cognition. If we are mostly water (about the same % as the planet itsellf, as above so below, micro/meso/macro cosm ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) ) and the the moon effects the motions of the on the oceans tides , it can effect the ripples in our minds (surface emotions). Personally I notice that my emotions and spirituality are directly tied to the solar cycle. Around this time of year I'm at my lowest and between spring and the summer solstice I'm jumping out of my skin. [Schizophrenics have been reported to exhibit elevated rates of winter and spring births.](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6V9F-4K66DKS-2&_user=10&_coverDate=11%2F30%2F2006&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_sort=d&view=c&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=de59007af7deb5386e15d6e8d5881e13)


There is a reason the winter solstice is traditionally a time for celebration, rather than the days getting, shorter, darker and colder, they start getting longer, brighter and warmer! The sun, our saviour, the light of the world, has risen from the depths, sacrificing its life (burning its fuel) as it has for billions of years so that there is eternal life on earth. Thank God! :D Blah, this stuff is pretty well common knowledge now.


![solstice.jpg](https://www.bluelight.org/community/proxy.php?image=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.jordanmaxwell.com%2Fimages%2Fsolstice.jpg&hash=e57bcf69dcb529e935449ee9dba62b1c)


As the pineal gland's (third eye) secretions of psychoactive amines (melatonin, pinoline, DMT-speculative) are modulated daily by exposure to light and larger yearly cycles, its logical it could be effected by other cycles. Its unique position isolated deep in the center of the brain could put it in a great vantage point to receive other parts of the EM spectrum like gamma rays and perhaps even emanations from the galactic core which might help explain the historical worldwide fascination with the precession of the equinox and other cosmic events.


As for DOC, my experience is quite limited, but I have a hunch the more recent powdered versions aren't quite as strong as the earlier crystalline batches for some reason.

Also, I don't know what is supposed to happen if I let an alcohols solution of doc evaporate.  But I did this with 15mg dissolved in vodka, and when it dried there wasn't crystals just white powder.  I understand that the doc was supposed to be ground into a powder, but after it had been dissolved and dried, shouldn't it of recrystallized???

it has crystalized. DOC power is made up of tiny crystals. you could of course recrystalize powder to make beautiful large crystals, but that's not practical (or of any use) in your example.

So dissolving it in vodka and evaporating the powder shouldn't of caused it to re-crystallize?  Thanks...  I would appreciate if anyone could confirm potency of any recently acquired batch of DOC for comparison..

**Possible serious loss in DOC potency?**


Just wondering, a sample of doc was recently aquired, to accuratly measure doses the sample was mixed with some rubbing alcohol and Listerine mouthwash, then placed onto blotter paper and dried overnight.  I had snorted about 2mg(estimated) of the reminance in the bag and licked it.  I then ate about a quarter sheet (4 sheets were made from 1g of doc). The only reason I did this was cuz quickly working upto 10 hits did nothing.  5 hours later I noticed I was tripping very lightly but the trip only lasted about 4 hours. The source of the sample has been exceptionally reliable in the past but several others reported taking several tabs from the same blotters and reported nothing happened.


Is this shit just blatently not doc or could the listerine have done something to it?

Merged in a question about DOC potency.


Personally I find that sometimes DOC seems to be very strong, and sometimes it barely affects me.  I always figured it was due to tolerance, but it does seem that various posters here have had issues with a sample of DOC, only to have it work at a later time.  I haven't even approached the kinds of doses you're talking about (be careful...), but I have taken 3mg from a batch, had a strong, visual trip, and then taken up to 8mg of the same batch later with just some DOC stimulation.

**LSD or DOX/ DOC????**


this past weekend had some "acid" printed on with the Hoffman bicycle blotter.  The hits were about a cm and a half square, much bigger than normal hits in size.    The hits had a very bitter taste to them, but I chocked that up to the dye in the paper.  I only took 1 hit and it began to kick in within 30mins of ingesting it.  The come up had a bit of nausea and muscle aches.  The peak lasted about 5-6 hours and the come down was very gradual, I was still tripping 12 hours later, feeling very wired and awake.  The entire trip was STRONG (from 1 hit) but manageable, the entire time I kept thinking, WOW this is some great LSD.


Im questioning weather this was LSD or DOX, possibly DOC.  My boyfriend is Delsyd, and he seems to believe that it was DOC not LSD.  Im skeptical however because what kind of joke would it be to put something other than LSD on Hoffman blotter???  


Just wondering/ looking for some other opinions.  Thanks.

And you'll no doubt get some opinions before the mods chime in with the "**NO ID THREADS**" rule.


My $0.02 is that LSD rarely if ever lasts that long and it never has for me (10 hour max in spite of pretty hefty doses) though for me it's still impossible to sleep at the +12 hour point.

I've never had blotters that didn't taste like paper either.

Although of course there's no way to tell, it does sound like DOC.  DOC reminds me greatly of LSD except it's got more of a strong, physical push which can be extremely euphoric.  it lacks the nasty body load that other DOXs can have.  At this point in time I actually prefer it to LSD, because LSD has yet to provide me with much, whereas I have had some incredible experience on DOC.

yep, IMO the hits were DOC.

i have had some experience with both DOI and DOC.


this trip definately reminded me alot of DOC. except it was even better than my previous trials with it. (i know it wasnt DOB or DOI because the trip didnt last long enough to be either and had very minimal body load).


In fact this has resparked my interest in the DOx family.

i cant wait to have further trials with DOC, DOI and especially DOM.


peace and love.

Of course it is possible. Nobody has died from an DOC overdose and the LD50 (the dose at which 50% of the population will die) is not established for DOC (this is done with animal testing and extrapolated to humans).

My dog came across 10mgs of DOC, I've been seeing all the talk about a 1mg/ml solution, but that seems too potent for me.


Would there be anything wrong with putting say the 10mg in 100ml of water so that the solution is 1mg/10ml.  


What if my dog was really paranoid and made a 1mg/100ml solution?


really i just want to know if the DOC, once dissolved, is evenly distributed in the liquid, as I would like a high degree of accuracy in my dosing.

Once dissolved, one can be sure that the DOC is evenly distributed. By the way, as long as you can measure out 1 ml with precision (e.g. with a syringe), a 1 mg/ml isn't more dangerous than a 100 mg/ml solution.

I just want to be sure of how much i ingest, (the less stress while tripping the better)

and it would seem the chance for error would be smaller if the solution is weak.


Isn't a ml about a drop?  That seems like too little liquid.


my dog likes to be safe.

No, a drop is **way** less than a mL.  There are a lot of drops per milliter.  Once dissolved the chemical will most assuredly be evenly distributed... that's how dissolving works.  You run into problems if a material is not water soluble... then it forms a suspension.  But DOC is definitely water soluble so you won't have to worry about that.


To measure a milliter, go to a pharmacy and buy an oral syringe, or even ask for one behind the counter, and they should give you one for free.  I bought one for a dollar which accurately measures by 1/5 mL increments, so it's extremely accurate to dose in this way.  Really there is no difference between a 1mg/mL solution and a 1mg/100ml solution in terms of safety if you can accurately measure.  In fact it would be a giant pain to measure out 100mL for each mg of DOC... it would probably be less accurately because you won't find a syringe that measures more than 10 or 20mL at a time, and you'd have to fill it multiple times.


But since you have so little of an amount of DOC (your dog rather), maybe you could go with 5mL per mg, or even 10mL per mg, just because 10mL of water is going to look really small in most jars or vials.


Finally, you should put some alcohol in the solution if possible, to prevent bacterial growth and such.  If you have access to everclear, you can use 20% everclear and 80% distilled water (distilled is important, don't use tap for this).  Or if you have vodka, you can use 40% vodka and 60% water.  Both of these will give you roughly 20% alcohol in the solution.  This is another reason for using a small amount of liquid, so that you don't use much alcohol.  You don't want to actually be affected by the alcohol... you just want it to prevent contamination.

why go this large amount of liquid? 1ml/mg is fine I think if you have a vial and an oral syringe.


I buy little vials that hold about 8-9ml of water. Those would be about perfect for you (they're about 3 inches high or maybe less).

I have to say, DOC has taken the place of 2c-e as my favorite phen, even after a friend fucked up the liquid dilution and we ended up taking 10.5mg each!! It produced the most beautiful, flowing visuals I have ever had. Even at this dose, there were no signs of toxicity, other than waking up almost 28 hours after the dose and still having visuals![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png). We were hungry the entire night, there was no nausea, and my pulse hit only 96 bpm at the peak (which was about 8 hours long). TR will be coming shortly.

I really like DOC, its one of my favorites as well. I do wish it were possible to cut the duration down somehow though, as I do not frequently have that kind of time. 5-8 hour long DOC would be fantastic


I do not get all tense on it like I fo DOI, DOB, DOM. Its got more of a lazy feel to it, to me, anyway. I don't get all jumpy and spastic like I would if I'f eaten like 6-8mg of  some of the others (DOM is not too bad though), and I can just relax and do whatever.

recently I had some acid but I don't think it was acid  ,  tasted bitter, and after ingesting one blotter  I had a trip that lasted about 24 hrs... I think it was some sort of DOC.... anyways, after the trip was coming to an end  I had trouble breathing(my lungs felt like they were very sore and so did my chest)... anybody else had this?

im really having a lot of trouble deciding the dosage for my next DOC trip, the timeline for 2mg was quite odd, after thirty minutes i rocketed up to a +3 then gradually came down over 15 hours, so it was initially a bit too intense followed by lacking intensity for an entire day. the logical next step would be 2.5mg but since im trying to cut down on tripping every week the idea of having another unsatisfactory experience is quite annoying. what about other DOx, what would be the 2.5mg DOC equivalent be for DOM? 6mg?

Anyway, it's impossible to say what you had but the trouble breathing thing does not sound like any reaction I've ever heard of from DOC.

**Anti-addictive effects from DOC**


After my high dose DOC trip the other night, I went from smoking a pack+ a day of camel menthol wides. During the trip, I had ***no*** urge to smoke, and cigarettes still just taste and feel disgustion. I now smoke 4-5 a day, just enough to keep the headaches at bay. The friend who I tripped with made major progress twards getting off of the opiates he loved/hated until that night. The 3rd person we were with (he only took 5mg) was also a heavy smoker until the trip started and has not had a single cigarette since. He crushed his pack and said fuck tobacco. It seems there be a major tool for ridding yourself of negative habbits with DOC. DOC seems a lot more managable and benign than ibogaine.


Has anyone else experienced this after trying DOC???

I think this is the case with many psychedelics. It helps to show us the folly of our habits. But for me it only lasts the length of the trip and the rest of the day. On 2CB I was instructed to throw away my cigarettes and lighter so I complied. I ain't saying no to the non physical.

My experience with psychedelics and smoking is, well quite the opposite.  I quite enjoy smoking on them.  I don't usually smoke normally and I find that they are just fun, relaxing things to do while tripping.

I stopped smoking before I ever got into psychedelics much, so I can't say specifically.  My worst habit over the past few years has been kratom, and I can't say that it helped me with that, because, well, kratom doesn't feel disgusting like cigarettes do, and it mixes really well with DOC.  However, DOC does produce a state of inner tranquility in me, particularly after the peak, which helps me to be totally satisfied with just myself and the little things in life, which lasts for a good 24 hours at least.  So I can definitely see how it could help with quitting cigarettes.


So how long has it been?  I hope you'll be able to use this temporary reprieve to do some work to prevent yourself from picking it back up. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  The way I quit was that one day I just realized how crappy cigarettes made me feel, and how much I hated the feeling of them.  So I stopped, and every time I had a craving I just reminded myself how shitty they are.  And then once my tolerance dropped, I started getting nicotine buzzes again if I smoked, and to me, the nicotine buzz is one of the nastiest, most foul feelings in the world.  So it was pretty easy to quit.  I never had any withdrawal symptoms at all.  Just cravings from time to time to be doing the action of smoking.

I have not quit entirely yet, but I only smoke 4-5 cigarettes a day as opposed to a pack+ a day before the trip. I hope to give them up entirely after my next DOC trip; and I think this one will be solo and outdoors to gain the full effects.

Our job is to attempt to discourage behavior like this as it is very reckless.


Take note that DOC can powerful constrict your veins, so it may be dangerous to overdose on.

Well, it could show up as an amphetamine, since it is amphetamine based.

There's no way to reliably eyeball any amount of DOC.  The difference between a few milligrams isn't noticeably unless you're looking at two different piles, and even then it's hard to be sure with an amount that small.  You can't remember what 4mg looks like reliably, trust me.  4mg looks different with every powder and even between different piles of the same powder, because of the way the crystals fall.  Your friend is treading on dangerous ground

**Tingling all over after tripping DOC**


@#$Hey guys/girls/in-betweens so here's the deal: back in February I turned 21 and did a lot of partying with Ketamine. I was doing about a gram a week for like a month and a half interspersed with DOC trips. 


// After the first time I tripped DOC at 3mg, I started getting tingling sensations all over my body, like when your foot falls asleep. It's a very superficial numbness and only occurs on the surface of my skin, there's no muscle soreness or pain or anything. It seems more pronounced when  I come into contact with cold things as well. I don't notice the tingling except when I touch something, like a persons arm, or laying down in bed, or picking up a cup. I originally thought that it was because I was doing what I thought was a lot of Ketamine and that I had a B12 deficiency(comparatively though it doesn't seem like a gram a week is a lot compared to some more hardcore K-heads out there). To remedy what I thought was too much Ketamine intake I took a lot of B complex supplements and  drank a bunch of B12 enriched smoothies. When it first started, the tingling was so bad I actually went to a doctor where they  bunch they did all sorts of shit like testing my reflexes and blood work --all ofwhich all came back normal. 


 The tingling faded and was pretty much gone by a week and a half later and I did some more K where the tingling remained at bay. I waited a few more weeks and then tried DOC again this past weekend and the tingling returned so I'm going to go out on a limb and say the DOC is causing this. 


WTF!!?! I love DOC, it's such a beautiful psychedelic and I really don't like that it's giving me this adverse physical reaction for weeks at a time afterwards. I've worked with this compound several times with doses ranging from 1-4MGs. A few of my friends have also sampled this batch of DOC at doses higher than me and reported no adverse side effects whatsoever. 


Could this be some sort of weird allergy? Does anyone else have similar experiences? What is going on?!?![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)


EDIT: I also have experience working with DOB and haven't experienced anything like this with that compound either.

Correct me if im wrong, but DOC is a psychedelic amphetamine and amphetamines constrict your blood vessels, so this tingling is probably due to lack of bloodflow to your extremeties. But the fact that it is lasting so long boggles me so maybe someone more experienced can help out.

yeah DOC is a psychedelic amphetamine and can cause vasoconstriction and muscle tension but I don't understand why this effect is lasting so long. Esp since with the DOC trip I'm usually down and out by 14 hours. I also do contortion and originally thought that perhaps I was stressing my body too much while I was tripping but I didn't do anything like that this past time.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but you say you were binging on K while on DOC?


You know that Ketamine (at least, the racemic and R-isomers) have tingling as a main effect? It is an anaesthetic, as you know.


But I may have misunderstood you.

yes but I never did the two at the same time and was doing K after I stopped doing DOC for a while and didn't tingle. I don't know which K isomer I had either, is there a way to tell?

DOC is a vasconstrictor... actually quite a potent one sometimes.  Tingling is just one of the side effects of this.  Whenever I take DOC, I get tingling in the fingers and toes (well sometimes), and I also get very visibly constricted veins, so much so that I will feel the large veins (arteries?) in my legs and arms pulling as I try to fully extend them.  It feels pretty freaky.

well my friend actually ended up dosing the uknown dosage i gave him. let's just say they tripped balls for 10-14hrs.

I took 2mg of this on Sunday, Mother's Day, kind of spur-of-the-moment... I was feeling a call to have some fun, which is pretty much why I took a long break from psychedelics.  For some reason I was expecting it to be like it was when I was doing a lot of psychedelics, that is, not powerfully psychedelic but rather a fantastically long, amphetamine-like euphoria producer.


It came on euphorically, and then around hour 3 it slammed into me and made me start feeling quite self-conscious... I felt strange hanging out with my fiance and cats.  I didn't have a lot to say.  The DOC visuals came into being in my vision very lightly, with patterns subtly swirling, especially clouds.  I felt a bit dizzy whenever I tried to look directly at anything, a curious effect that DOC can have on me.  I had some kratom to try to make myself feel a bit less strange, and it only succeeded in amplifying the dizzy feeling strongly.  From hours 3 to 6 I was quite uncomfortable overall, but it was manageable.  I berated myself for taking a powerful psychedelic spur-of-the-moment, and figured I'd be in for a very long period of discomfort.  I felt guilty for ruining mother's day, as I had to call my mom still, and I was planning to make dinner to celebrate it with my fiance who is a mother to our kitties.


Then around hour 6, maybe 7, the fog lifted, slowly at first.  I started feeling very euphoric indeed, energized, full of insight and emotion.  Everything on the TV became something to joyfully analyze.  I transferred this energy to my fiance and we spent the rest of the day and night having the time of our lives, talking and talking and talking and snuggling and discussing issues.  I achieved the absolutely wonderful euphoria that DOC used to produce in me, a magical feeling of zen-like peace and comfort in living in the moment.  This fveeling stayed with me through Monday as well, and partway through Tuesday.  It has yet to fully dissipate.  Overall I feel that it did me some good... I had been stuck in a bit of a negative place with all the stresses in my life recently and it felt fantastic to just step out of that for a day or two and feel free, and dissect the stresses I have been encountering in my mind without anxiety getting in the way.


And none of that horrible vasoconstriction!


Now I need to make sure not to start using it weekly as a remedy for dealing with life, like I used to.

I heard on the radio one time that N2O is a vasodilator. Could nitrous be taken in conjunction with DOxs to effectively counterbalance the tingling sensation?

Damn those breaks, always sneaking up on you. I have done that where you take it thinking it might be *just* an enhancer on whatever you are doing but then you find you are saying to yourself "Fuck, I am *tripping!"* 

I want to try this substance pretty bad. Hopefully I will have a lil extra cash soon.

Don't buy a whole bunch at once, or you'll have wasted your money if you find you don't like it.  Personally, I hate it.  The trip makes me feel like I'm going totally schizophrenic, and then on the comedown I feel like I'm coming down from a day-long cocaine binge.  Horrible stuff.  That said, the friends I gave the rest away to loved it, so clearly, your mileage may vary.  ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Wow, I didn't realise DOC was a vasocontrictor. That is something that's new to me.


I will have the opportunity to try some later this week, should I be concerned about this? How does DOC feel in terms of stimulation when compared to phens? Does it create strong CEVs in the second half of the trip?

I think all of the psychedelic amphetamines are vasoconstricting due to their potency and non-selective binding to all of the 5-HT2 receptor subtypes: 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B and 5-HT2C.  The 5-HT2B receptor is found in mainly in the peripheral nervous system and certain 5-HT2B receptor agonists cause nasty cardiac effects, so I wouldn't use the 2,5-dimethoxy-amphetamines frequently.  Come to think of it, I don't know a psychedelic that is not a vasoconstrictor--at least to a certain degree.  The ergoloids certainly are, psilocin and the 4-OH-tryptamines are, the psychedelic amphetamines are.  Perhaps 2C-x compounds are the least vasoactive, but it is tough to consider them proper psychedelics (although I've never had 2C-E and people claim that one is a mindfuck).


To anyone considering taking a 2,5-dimethoxy-amphetamine, keep in mind that they are intense, really fucking intense and are not be toyed with indiscriminately.  You must be absolutely certain of the dose and have a lot of time on your hands.  The trip is long and very fatiguing.  They are not like LSD, where one can trip and wake up the next day feeling like a million bucks, since the trip is so long, you will be tired for a day or two afterwards.

Yeah, I find the idea of having a "psychedelic weekend" very interesting, but needless to say I have taken note of your warnings - thanks for that. It'll be challenging and new, but I'm sure I've been through worse before. Oh god....much worse. Psychedelics are not toys!!


Riemann - you should try 2C-E. ASAP.

DOC is a vasoconstrictor, but if I only use it occasionally in reasonable doses, I don't notice it much.  When I was using it a lot, it started giving me troubling amounts of vasoconstriction, but at 2-4mg, it's not really noticeable.

**Important question**


a recent batch of DOC was shown to be of low quality, how low has not been quantified. this raises a question about stability of DOx in storage, although they are assumed to be very stable this could be incorrect, or it could be a result of sloppy synthesis, in which case all people working with this material need to inquire as to what the inactive material is composed of and if its safe. perhaps someone with more chem knowledge could give some insight into what possible contaminates would be.


information regarding the dosage of this batch has not come out but i hope BLers will post their findings, with a DOx chem dosage is already tricky WITHOUT an unknown amount of degradation. i encourage anyone working with this material to start low and work with it as if it is their first time. remember with such a potent chem even a 25% potency lose will only change an 'average' dose from 2.5mg to 3.25mg.

There have been occasions of other chemicals being sent out accidently.


if i rerember correctly the first batch of 2c-tfm or was it DOC? regaradless, one of those just ended up being 2c-i.

It's unlikely DOC stored under reasonable conditions will degrade even over many years. However, certain synthetic routes can lead to production of dichlorinated and trichorinated analogs mixed with DOC, likely reducing its potency or even rendering it almost inert...

The PiHKAL entry says that DON and DOA are intermediates in the synthesis, in which case the products could be subjectively different in effect, perhaps more stimulating in the case of DON. I dont know enough about chem to understand what the difference btw monochlorinated, dichlorinated and trichlorinated product would be (are any of these active/dangerous?) but if someone could clear this up it would be great. some material could def be submitted for analysis if delsyd or others would assit with the means to do such.![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


also it was the batch of 2c-tfm which contained a large quantity of 2c-i or at least thats what hugo at ADD said...

i remember reading that the "doc" was all 2c-i, but that the "2c-tfm" was 2c-tfm + random 2c-x's including 2c-i.


but why nit-pick :D

The impurities would depend on where they fucked up.  If there wasn't enough chlorine, or of the chlorination didn't work quite properly, there could be some 2,5-dimethoxyamphetamine in there.  Otherwise, as stated above, there could be extra chlorines on there instead of not enough.  If the impurity was a result of improper synthesis, it would almost have to be an amine, as anything else would be removed by even a half-assed chemist.  I can't think of anywhere else that the synthesis could go wrong, so I'm pretty sure any other impurity would have to be intentional.  If so, there's no hope of guessing what it is.

based on the sources response i get the impression that the impurity was NOT intentional. That said 2,5-DMA would be nothing to sweat over. im assuming the correct number of chlorines is one...would the dichlorinated or trichlorinated material be toxic, or just inactive?

I know exactly of the batch you are referring to, and am also equally concerned.


I don't have the means to test this yet, (in terms of what the inactive part is made up of) but have also received a response from the vendor that suggests the impurity was by no means intentional. Feel free to PM me if you want to doublecheck that we are discussing the same batch.

Indeed, the proper number of chlorines is one.  However, I'm not aware of any research being done with multiple ones attached.  I've not the slightest idea of their effect.

ok so quick question why is that a tri-flouro group in 2c-tfm would be very active and considerably more potent than the virtually inactive 2c-f, but a trichloro group on DOC would be inactive? is it because of the methyl group in 2c-tfm?

On 2C-TFM, it's a trifluro*methyl* group, like 2C-D with all the hydrogens on the 4-methyl replaced with fluorines.  They're all attached to the methyl, which is then on the 4-position.  It's not a trichloro group that would attach itself to the 4-position of 2,5-DMA during the synthesis, but three chlorine groups attaching themselves to three separate locations.  It wants to go to the 4-position first, but if there's an excess of chlorine they will start replacing hydrogens at other locations on the molecule as well.  I'm not completely certain where, but I'd bet the farm that they'd start filling in the empty spots on the ring (3 and 6) and then, if there were an even greater excess, they might start attaching to the side chain.

yes please do be careful, even a single mg over or under the intended dosage can produce extreme differences in effects and could mean the differece between a good trip and a bad trip.

AAhh im so hyped i have heard it is is quite a happy trip ! I have to ask about the visuals being compared to and mostly stronger then acid. Though i havent tried acid i have done mushrooms alot some tryptamines and some 2Cxx. wat sort of visuals should i expect ??

The visuals are quite LSD-like but I do find them stronger in general.  They differ in quality a bit... hard to explain that sort of thing, really.  LSD's visuals appear more natural, and DOC's are a bit more "neon" (for me at least).


I find the trip quite happy... usually at first it can be a bit overwhelming (depending on dose).  Usually around hour 6 or 8 (depending on dose) I enter the second stage, which is less trippy and more euphoric... it makes me feel so great at that stage.  I can't stop talking and moving around and having ideas.


Definitely expect a VERY long trip (24 hours total is no exaggeration).  You will be tripping strongly for 6-8 hours, and then it will plateau and the plateau lingers on until hour 24 or even longer sometimes, although I always feel quite capable of doing stuff on the plateau, including talking to people and stuff.


It's nothing like tryptamines or any of the 2C-Xs... you're in for a ride.  DOC and the DOXs in general are very, very strong... very immersive substances.  Please do not take it unless you're in a safe setting where nothing can happen for at least 24 hours.  Benzos will only make you a little calmer... they won't kill the trip like they will with weaker substances.

^^ For a while it was very popular.  I guess it kinda fell off.  Which is fine by me. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


Plus a good-sized group of people find it uncomfortable.  I am not one of those, although LSD is certainly more comfortable in the body.

Exactly. The methoxy groups on the ring are hard to pull off without wrecking the rest of the molecule first.

If a batch of DOC is impure (say 40 per cent), what would be a good starting dose?

I was thinking 7mg.....does this seem reasonable? too high? too low?


I am a little bit apprehansive to try my DOC which is currently sitting in the freezer for this reason.

40%? I heard 20-30% then I heard 50-60%. Hmm, so your guess is as good as your dealer's.


I would say less than 7mg. You can gain a little experience with it before you commit to a larger dose (and you put your health on the line for the assesment of your vendor).


medium-low doses of DOC are supposed to be very good, like a stimulating euphoriant with a psychedelic edge.


Enjoy! write us an interesting trip report that we can read when were all chilled out stoned and relaxed if you feel like!

Damn it, this makes me a sad panda. ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)  The last thing we or anyone needs is DOC that can't be accurately dosed. ![:|](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eyesclosed.gif)


If it's *actually* 40% (I'm not sure how you would verify this), then a good starting dose would be in the ballpark of 6-7mg.  But if I were you, sadly, I'd never use it.  Unless you can somehow verify this figure.


I mean, I guess if you know for sure it's a good bit weaker, then it could only go so wrong (you'd underestimate instead of over).  But if it's 40% pure, what's the rest?  It just seems unnecessarily shady to me... I don't trust it.

DOC's real magic, for me, is in the afterglow I get the day after the trip. My vision is fuzzy and light, colors seem softer and the world just has a carefree feeling. Its such a wonderful experience, very therapuetic if properly utilizied.


Dont get me wrong, though. The actual trip itself is wonderful too ![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif) 


Ive learned to dose very early with DOC. Usually I wake up a few hours earlier than usual if I plan to trip. The few times Ive done this, though, Ive noticed an extremely acidic like feeling in my stomach if I drink any coffee. It can be quite uncomfortable. So I avoid coffee now whenever I take DOC.


Beautiful substance, need to sample other DOx's now.

^^ Yes, I agree... the afterglow of DOC is my favorite part.  On a low dose it's pure afterglow the whole time.


I have tried DOI, DOB, DOM, and DOT (aleph-1) as well, and none of them really hold a candle to DOC's perfect potential to me, I have to say.  With the rest of them, the aftereffects are annoying, but with DOC, they're heavenly... it's like zen in a molecule.  DOM is more classifically psychedelic, less warm, more transparent... I like DOC's effect on the body... it's all fuzzy and soft.


Great stuff. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  Took me a while to get the hang of.  If you use it too much it starts to cause really bad vasconstriction... disgusting vasoconstriction in fact, the kind that makes you worry you're going to do some damage.

Thanks for the responses everyone.


Xorkoth, I'm not sure if I will be using this chemical now. I agree with you, there's no way to tell what makes up the other 60%...Truth be known, I was never all that interested in DOC anyway.


Nevermind, it just so happens that I will be receiving some 4-HO-MET this week..... might PM you if thats OK, to find out some more about it?

Lets try to not incriminate ourselves when posting As always with any new substance I plan on starting very, very low to avoid any troubles, and then work my way upwards... What I wanted do know is, do you keep control over your actions? Has anybody experienced blackouts or been in a situation when you can't really control what you're doing? Again, I'm talking about low dosages, in the beginning I plan to start with 0.5/1mg or thereabouts.

LOL... I remember the old thread I started, raving about how great DOC was, and then Gloggawogga and cronies came along accusing anybody who loved DOC to be liars and false profiteers.


Anyway I still do love DOC and I'm still not making it up ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif) 


Last weekend I ate about 0.5mg at about 1:00pm... because it had been a few years and, why the hell not.


I ended up tripping +/++ with a 4 to 5 hour ++ peak time. Unexpected guests came over and it actually turned out to be fun socializing.


The high quality of this trip and great body feelings, almost complete lack of what people call a body load... hell I didn't even have gas from it.. reminded me why I used to rank this along side LSD.


Coming up there are some festivals I plan to attend. Between my choice of white crystal 200ug blotter and DOC... I am actually much more excited to eat the DOC.


Probably gonna be 3mg next time. Most I ever did was 4mg but I have a feeling that 3mg will be more than enough now that I don't trip nearly as often.

^thats funny BD, because i experience bodyload pretty much every time iv taken DOC, then again my body reacts that way to pretty much all psychs, i have a weak tummy.

Even LSD, 2c-b, molly and other psychs that tend to cause no bodyload have  made me vomit or nauseas on occasions.

I haven't been around long enough, or pay attention well enough to pretend I know what you're talking about.


However, I've noticed that it takes several trials with DOC before the user really 'gets it'. I think a lot of people are turned off by DOC because they only tried it once or twice, and didn't really work with the material long enough to fully appreciate it in all its glory.

Hi everyone ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


I'm off on holiday tomorrow and would like to try some DOC before I go. I'm not after intense effects, but something that is noticeable and pleasurable whilst still being able to act normally. I was thinking 1mg-1.5mg, does that sound about right?


Much love ![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif)

A lot of people have said that DOC is pretty similar to LSD. After finally trying LSD a few months back, I agree. DOC feels much more like a tryptamine than a phenethylamine, even though it is a phenethylamine. The effects are very similar to LSD, mentally and visually. I've had near total ego loss on DOC and LSD.


DOI and the 2c-x phenethylamines all have somewhat similar visuals, though they affect the mind differently. The visuals I get from DOC are more like LSD's visuals. The body feeling is also sometimes very tryptamine like.


DOC is definitely one of the deeper and most enjoyable of the psychedelics I've tried.


I've also had some pretty dark, scary, and depressing trips with DOC. One trip in particular had me feeling some of the worst despair, sadness, and self-disgust I have ever felt while tripping or sober. It did turn out to be one of my most positive/helpful trips in the end. I did not trip for a while after that one. It somehow left me with a much more positive mindstate for a good while afterward.

I have snorted and plugged DOC. The come up is much faster, full effects within 30min, compared to 2-3 hours for oral ingestion. Plugging and snorting give pretty much the same result. I'd prefer plugging it, as it burns pretty bad when you snort it. You only need 50% or so of your normal dose. Maybe a bit more, but you should start with no more than half a typical dose if you snort or plug. 


The side effects are increased if you snort or plug. I don't get too much nausea from eating it, but I vomited once after plugging it and felt quite a bit of nausea for the first 3 or 4 hours. I've also felt like my blood pressure may have been elevated a bit, though I don't really know. I've never felt that from eating it. My heart rate did not seem to be any higher than usual.


The total duration of the trip seems to be less when plugged or snorted, I'm not sure by how much.


I have also eaten my first dose then snorted or plugged a small amount a few hours into the trip to prolong the peak effects. That did not seem to cause any additional side effects.


I would prefer just eating it, and maybe plugging or snorting 1 or 1.5mg 5-8hrs into the trip to prolong the strongest effects. I don't think the increase in potency or faster come up from snorting/plugging is worth the extra side effects. You are much less likely to have an enjoyable or productive trip if you are distracted by side effects.


With DOC, I usually can't sleep for at least 18-20 hours after dosing. I prefer to sleep late the morning before tripping, then dose close to my normal bedtime. That way, I'll be able to sleep normally the next night. If you dose early in the morning, you'll be up all night and exhausted the next day. I've had no problem with feeling tired during the trip the way I do it.

If you've never done it before I would be really cautious about this... in fact, it's just a really bad idea to use something for the first time in a situation where you need to act normally.  I do use low doses of DOC in such situations... it's a great chemical for it.  But I'm very experienced with it as well.  It's very strong and it absolutely does not let up.  It leaves social skills pretty intact but it can definitely create that awkward social tripping state, especially if taken unaware.  Generally for me hours 2 to 4 are the most likely to be difficult... after that it starts to level out.  By hour 8 to 10, it should have reached a beautiful plateau.  If possible, I might recommend taking some 8 to 10 hours before the situation you actually want to be in... maybe the night before?  Then you can ride out the afterglow/plateau all day.  In fact I use it like this pretty often at times.


But like I said, you really need to use it in a safe and controlled environment and get the hang of it first.  As has been mentioned recently in this thread, it seems to take people a few tries to really "get it".  It was extremely overwhelming for me the first few times... its character really changed after I had some experience with it.

without once again sounding like an idiot, i am pretty sure i have now taken some kind of DO (C)? something. the trip i had the other night lasted at LEAST 22 hours. i went to sleep for a while and woke up and it was still going. to be honest i was freaked out because this has never happened to me before. the blotter was bitter as hell and came on very slowly.


 but it WAS visual as hell, but in a more feathery geometric way (only way i know how to describe it) than L. 


I have a lot of questions about this category of psychedelic, there are obviously lots of practical problems with it, i basically burned three days of my life when you factor in all the sleep i needed after the trip. missed dentist appointments, work, etc. bad.


 but good experience. i reached out to a lot of people i hadnt talked to it in years and learned a ton about myself. heavy. 


anyone else every have this happen where they didnt know what they were getting into?


also, if you take less, is there any way to make it a shorter trip? or is this just one of those things that has a two step character? long come up, long peak, long plateau? weird stuff. anyone else get heavy auditory with it? i took a bath and the water coming out of the faucet was almost singing to me. very intense.


thanks so much

Nope, it pretty much just lasts a long time.  I mean, low doses will produce a slightly shorter trip, but it's still on the order of 20+ hours.  Low doses are a lot less intense though... I really enjoy them.

Lately 4mg and 5mg were eaten, spaced 1 weekend apart.


The 4mg trip was slightly stronger than the 5mg trip that was taken the week before.

....


The 4mg trip was combined with MDMA and Ketamine. Great synergy. MDMA mixes with DOC much like it does with LSD, except I felt more focused and "intense" with the DOC. Ketamine mixes well with pretty much any psychedelic if you like Ketamine.


The 5mg trip provided moments of deep insight and watching the ocean, I could see each ripple and wave at once and this formed some pretty cool patterns and a feeling of one-ness with my surroundings.


DOC is also excellent to take with little bumps of Ketamine and go see Deep Banana Blackout :D ... this combo had me dancing like outta this world

somebody mentioned danger of impurities..is that more common with DOC than with acid? (on blotter i mean)?


the only thing for me was some body load. a bit of nausea and i could not eat. i usally love to eat on psychedelics (well not mushrooms or k) ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


anyway. i guess i will try this again when i have a whole weekend free. does anyone else find it to be very empathetic? i reached out to a lot of people.

A week or so ago, I ingested 2 mg of (what should be) DOC. It was very intense (certainly more than I expected). Interestingly, two friends also had the same dose, and reported somewhat mild effects. But the most bizarre thing about it, was how short it lasted. At, say, 8 hours, one could say that I was almost at baseline, which is unusually short for me (e.g. 2c-i lasts as long as DOC for me). Sleep at +13h was still difficult, though.

One might want to ponder whether they know anybody who took a small dose of amphetamine a day or two before and passed the drug test. That would indicate that there is a threshold that has to be met, that only a larger dose would be sufficient. So, then the 1-5mg of DOC the person is taking would seem inconsequential.


Thats just theoretically though...maybe even 1mg of amphetamine will trigger the test?

I've never tried DOB. Doesn't sound really appealing to me.


Oh I forgot to mention, sleep came easily 10 hours after dosing 5mg with the help of a little benzos and a K-Hole right before bed. Woke up the next day sober.


With the 4mg trip I did get about 5 hours of light sleep maybe 11 hours after dosing, again with help of light benzos and plenty of Ketamine. Woke up still tripping at a light ++.

I do use low doses of DOC in such situations... it's a great chemical for it.  But I'm very experienced with it as well.  It's very strong and it absolutely does not let up.  It leaves social skills pretty intact but it can definitely create that awkward social tripping state, especially if taken unaware.  Generally for me hours 2 to 4 are the most likely to be difficult... after that it starts to level out.  By hour 8 to 10, it should have reached a beautiful plateau.  If possible, I might recommend taking some 8 to 10 hours before the situation you actually want to be in... maybe the night before?  Then you can ride out the afterglow/plateau all day.  In fact I use it like this pretty often at times.

Here's the thing, fellas:


Even *if* DOC were to trigger a positive on the initial drug screen, the positive result would *require *a confirmatory GC/MS analysis, in which individual sample (urine, blood, hair) eluents would be compared to known spectra of whatever drugs the examiner would be looking for at that point.


It is *extremely *unlikely that the spectrum of DOC would be included in that spectra list, in fact in all the research I've done on drug testing, it appears that drug testing companies and Medical Review Officers (MRO's) don't--among many other "RC's"--even know what it *is*.


If a positive result *does *come back, then the person being tested must not admit to taking any drugs, and must insist that the confirmatory test be done. A lot of MRO's will blow off the confirmation and attempt to get an admission from the person being tested--because it saves them time and the company money. But one should *never *admit anything to an MRO--and force the confirmation even if he/she knows they're "dirty."


Stick to this strategy and one should--for the present at least--never come up dirty for DOC. ![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif)

The thing to remember is that--like LEO's, you *never *gain anything by giving information to an MRO. Name, rank, and serial number--that's *it*. If they accuse you of anything, ask for proof and never admit--you won't get in "trouble" for using this strategy.


Thus, your personal life is none of their fucking business so don't feel the need to share. I realize that this is getting into legal and drug-testing issues, but I feel anyone who experiments in their personal time with things like DOC should know this, and in this respect the information is on-topic.

Taking less would lead to a somewhat shorter trip, but would be less intense too.


You might get a shorter trip if you snort or plug it. It definitely comes on a lot faster that way, 30 minutes instead of 2.5-3 hours. I know the trip is quite a bit shorter if you do that with a 2c-x chemical. I don't know how much it would shorten a DOC trip. I do know that it seemed to be a shorter trip when I did that, but I wasn't keeping track of the time.


An IV injection would probably lead to a much shorter trip. I know it does with the few psychedelics I have IV'd at a high enough dose to produce full effects.I'm not recommending anyone to try this. I don't know how safe it will be.  Be VERY careful if you try doing this. Start low. I IV'd 0.5mg of DOI once and felt significant effects, it was enough for a +2 IIRC. I would have felt little or nothing from eating or even snorting that amount. I'm pretty unsure of just how strong it was and how much was used. It was a long time ago. It may be 3-4x as potent when IV'd compared to oral, possibly even more.

^^^^ Well even *if *DOC were to trigger a positive on the preliminary screen, I think enough time has elapsed for it to clear from your system in any event, so I don't think it will happen.


If, for whatever reason, you get the call to come see the MRO, he might try to force an admission of drug use from you. As I said before, don't fall for it. Admit nothing and demand the confirmatory test--it will clear you.


Re the worries: your employment is damned important, and your concern is absolutely justified. That's why knowing the rules of the game is so important. But relax, you're gonna be fine... ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Well the fact that there's an entirely separate test to the amphetamine screeeing to test for MDMA sort of says that anything based on amphetamine  with a degree of ring substitution isn't going to give a positive.


As for admitting anything, I'd go as far as saying never admit to any recreational drug use, but it's useful to know that ephedrine/pseudoephedrine can trigger a false positive for amphetamines, so saying you'd recently had some Pseudofed (as it can be bought OTC without a prescription, they can't peanalize you for using a legal medicine to treat a condition) because your sinuses were congested will force them to either shut the fuck up or do a GC/MS type analysis while not leaving the door open for them to be snidey fucks and imply that you've been taking amphetamines.through innuendo


As tobala said, the confirmation test is a lot of additional expense for them and if you've given a reason for a false positive (never let them know that you know ephedrine can cause a false positive, just ask if it could and let them come to their own conclusions), they're a hell of a lot more likely to just believe that and save the cost of an additional analysis

Well I for one am of the opinion that you should confront any MRO with a solid foundation of knowing what they're up to. I've snagged *my *knowledge from lurking on forums dedicated to MRO info. They don't like it when guys like me come around, and they even say that they are against using the info on their *public *forums as a means to subvert the drug testing industry.


Thus, I lurk and acquire information, but never contribute because there's no need. In my many hours hanging out with these MD's, I've found they fall into two categories:


1. The type that don't want to see lives disrupted by drug testing. They will listen to explanations for positive results and don't feel good about reporting them. But, of course, it's their job and their concerns are valid when testing truck drivers, airplane pilots, etc. They are skeptical when they send a potential CompUSA employee as positive because who gives a fuck if the guy who's trying to sell you a modem smoked pot over the weekend? The senior mod of a forum I lurk on doesn't even believe that testing for prescription drugs is a good idea because people tend to share prescriptions and he ultimately feels it's a waste of time. Needless to say, I respect and like this individual because he has values that extend beyond generating revenue for an industry...


2. The type who like drug testing as a means of social engineering. These guys are like LEO's in that they don't care if your test is positive for amphetamine because you ingested ephedrine or pseudoephedrine. They exist to validate the drug testing industry that employs them, and will do whatever they can to force an admission of drug use out of you. Don't even cater to them by admitting *anything*. Tell them to *prove *you are drug-positive by providing a GC/MS confirmation. Ask to see it and demand that they prove your result conforms to the spectra that they compare your results to. Trust me, they will go right on the defensive because your lawyer is waiting for them to fuck up, right? ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


Basically, these guys will behave as LEO's in that they will try to coerce an admission of drug use based on a preliminary screen--i.e., inconclusive evidence. In my opinion, there's no reason to go on the defensive with them, in fact I would come out swinging and say, "Fine, the preliminary test was positive, but let's see what the GC/MS confirmation says. If it doesn't confirm for whatever you're looking for, go fuck yourself."


Don't let an MRO dictate the course of your life. He needs to back up his results with proof via chemical testing which includes a reliable (and expensive) GC/MS confirmation. He doesn't want to do this because he will have to spend more of his time and more of the company's money.


But *make* him do this and act like you know exactly what you're talking about, because if he fucks up you will sue the shit out of him for fucking up your livelihood based on an imprecise preliminary screen.

^ Personally I'd treat them with the contempt they deserve if they fell into the second group; not at all difficult to do & get away with if you have a reasonable knowledge of pharmacology & related topics. I had an interviewer try to pull that sort of shit when I went for my teacher training interview because I once had a lump of hash fall out of my lab coat while doing my lab project in the final year of my degree. Obviously somebody there had said something rather disparaging to the TT interview panel and they had me labelled as a major drug fiend (moi? ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)) who should never be let anywhere near a classroom full of kids. Next day they got a letter from me demanding to know what had been said & who had said it with a view to taking them to court for defamation of character and that I'd be seeing my solicitor later that day so they could expect notification of legal action sometime in the near future...


Got a phone call the day after from the TT place that was almost grovelling in its apology for such a thing ever occuring (I still made noises about legal action unless the name of the person who had initiated all this shit was forthcoming for a few weeks, just to make sure they knew I was not to be fucked around with). Of course I never even went anywhere near a solicitor's office, I just knew that they'd royally fucked up by acting on hearsay and decided to make a point. The whole time I was in the teacher training program, nobody ever brought up the subject of drugs with me again, so I must have made an impression (if they'd done a urinalysis, I'd have been a bit buggered, but this was the late 80's and drug testing in the UK wasn't even a glimmer in some twisted fucker's mind ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif))

That's unfortunate. Almost certainly there was no need for hospitalization.


For long acting amphetamine-based psychedelics it is nice to have a benzo handy just in case. Certainly beats a trip to the hospital!

I wouldn't worry too much, I'm sure he'll be fine.  There's a report on erowid of two people accidentally taking 16mg of DOI thinking it was 2C-I, and they were perfectly fine.  DOI is generally harsher on the body too.


Are you sure it was measured right?  He must have been very sensitive!  I wish him the best.

Do you know how he measured the dose? Most of us do not have a scale or balance capable of measuring such small amounts (I do, though).


If he used liquid measurement, there are a couple of ways the dose could have easily been miscalculated.


1. He could have had a larger amount than he thought. Some people have got as much as twice the amount paid for. If he paid for 100mg and was given 200mg, he would have taken double the intended dose unless he weighed it before dissolving.


2. Some people have tried measuring using drops of liquid, where one drop is supposed to be 1ml or something. In reality, the drop could be 2 or 3 times that. That is not a good way of measuring.


A mistake can easily be made unless the instrument can weigh very small amounts or a known amount is dissolved in liquid and measured very carefully.


It could be that he is unusually sensitive, or just had a difficult trip. I personally think DOC is one of the most physically benign psychedelics out there, but I have had some mentally difficult trips. My first DOC trip was really tough, and that was with a 4mg dose.


I would not worry too much about trying it myself, unless there was some trouble with your friend's vital sign (Blood pressure, heart rate, etc.) measurements at the hospital.


I've checked my blood pressure and heart rate while on a pretty good dose of DOC, and it was within its normal range. I don't think it typically causes much of an increase in BP or HR, unless you are feeling anxious or panicky.

I was the one who weighed it out. I weighed 17mg out on a mg scale, and put this in 17 mls of water. I dosed 3.5mg (3.5ml), and the him and someone else 3mg. It just looks like he was extremely sensitive to it, as that was the second time I did it, and the last time I did 2mg.


There was no real need for him to go the hospital, he was just worried and was tripping and thought that was the best idea.

^^^^ Looks like you did everything right. I know the 2C-*X*'s kick my ass at relatively low doses when I'm not tolerant, and my one experience with DOI at 1.5 mg was pretty out there.


So yeah, these things can hit some of us pretty hard... ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Yep, some people are just really sensitive to things.  My first 2C-E trip my friend and I took both took 14mg and he was fine, but I got my ass kicked.  During the peak I could barely see and kept falling into random visions that I thought were real.


My friend just sat there happily with his headphones on, watching me, haha.


Glad he's okay!

first time doing 2mg DOC the other day. very very good except some sort of something in my chest.i think it was my muscles or breast plate. something along those lines. dont think it was my heart. and another thing down by my pelvic region . around the area where that V is. some pressure or a knot or something is what it felt like. besides that it was good. peaked in 2-3 hrs which suprised me and then started to weaken very slowly for another 10-11 hrs. think i like it better than 2c-e so far though there is still a lot of experimenting to do.

Getting two tabs that may contain DOC, due to the bitter taste and length of other's experiences.


Is there any huge dangers in combining with MDMA?

Or is it a definite no no?

DOC + MDMA is like LSD + MDMA ... but more focused, intense, and "in the moment"...


But it sounds like you're not even sure if you have DOC, let alone the dose. I'd test the waters gradually.. you can always boost a DOC trip by eating more a couple hours after eating a small amount. It's not like LSD where tolerance kicks in almost instantly.

So if you need to chill out for w/e reasons xanax can help? I ask because i always keep a supply of benzos when i trip "just in case" and i had read somewhere that benzos cant stop the trip like it can with lsd if need be.

It can help mellow you out/calm things down, yes. Its not going to terminate the trip, though.

It will effectively terminate the trip if you take enough to knock yourself out (sometimes the best option). But, usually if you need it THAT bad then somebody has to adminster to you, because you've become delusional/aggressive/violent.

I've had some DOC laying around for about a year now. The only reason me and my girlfriend haven't had it yet is cos of the duration. We've also had some pretty good quallity blotter available lately so we've been indulging in that a fair bit instead.


Basically, we want to be able to sleep on the night of taking it. Maybe a few people could answer this question for me:-


If we dosed early (8am) in the morning on an empty stomach, like say 2.5mg? Would we be able to sleep that night (at like midnight) with the assistance of benzo's maybe?


Sorry if a similar question has already been asked. I UTSE but couldnt come up with anything really. Cheres ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I've never taken it (same boat as you, I have access to good L so whenever I take a long thing its that), but from what I gather some people find sleep attainable by 12-14 hours and sometimes others find it impossible until like 24 hours. It varies I guess.


Benzos will surely help but I notice they really hinder the integration the next day though, so its an exchange.

I can fall asleep after maybe 10-12 hours of DOC...some people can't for 24+ ... Gaian Planes is exactly right.


As for DOC+MDMA.... I'll admit I probably had a mg or two of clonazepam in me and it was still a very intense peak. But I was also watching my favorite band at a sick festival. Set+Setting+good drugs indeed!

BD, that sounds like a good combination. I think I might try 1-2mg alongside some LSD sometime.


do you suggest dosing the DOC before the LSD?

re: hospitalization

You have to be careful with the DOxs as some people react much differently than others, and to different doses.  I highballed a dose of DOB and then mismeasured which nearly left me in the hospital and dramatically cut down on all subsequent psychedelic use, and I've seen all means and manners of crazy erratic behaviour resulting from doses of 3mg+ with DOI (paranoid delusions, people attacking hospital staff, that sort of thing).  Be careful and if you're new I'd recommend starting around 1.5mg with all the halogenated DOxs.

Great advice, Nuke. There do seem to be a small but substantial portion of people that get absolutely twisted and possibly delusional on doses that myself and most people I know of who have experienced -- well, in my case just DOI and DOC, of which I love DOC and find DOI boring and bothersome in its duration..


Although I doubt DOC in modest doses is going to cause a seriously life threatening situation even in people who react badly. Unfortunately if people "go the wrong way" on this one it's going to be a long ride. DOC certainly doesn't cause nearly as much vasoconstiction in me as DOI seemed to, and DOB from what I hear is by far the worst in this regard.


DOC feels about as rough on my body as a light dose of clean amphetamine, I believe a solid dose of Xanax could mitigate almost any problem.

Well I've done LSD with DOC twice... the 1st time it was LSD > DOC right when the LSD was done peaking. The 2nd time was DOC , sleep, waking up still tripping at a ++ and taking lots of LSD.

The one time I took DOC, 2mgs, I was unable to sleep for TWO consecutive nights, and even after waking up after the third night (and first night of sleep) I definitely felt the unimistakeable nootropic signature of a tail end DOC trip.  


I'm not a pharmacologist but I think there's got to be an enzymatic difference in some people that makes it a lot toughter to clear this chem from the body.  My girlfriend was sleeping like a baby at hour 14 while I was fully dilated, stimulated, diarhea, +3 tripping.  Also, I have no trouble getting to sleep after acid or MDMA at a normal time--I can slip into sleep while coming down from a roll or acid by taking deep breaths and entering that dream state.  On DOC though, even by night two, I was just way too stimulated.


My advice is, if you haven't experimented with DOC, make sure you have three full days to recover.  I had to call in sick for work, at a job I could handle on acid, no sweat.  The insane head I had on DOC would NOT have allowed me to function in society, though, at all.  I was bonkers.

OH, OK, I thought this is what you were saying...I figured DOC would mirror some of the properties of MDMA (at least to a certain extent) and provide a candyflipping type experience (very heavy psychedelic trip obviously).


I might do this for the equinox. It will be my first time trying DOC, so I think I will dose 1mg and then let it take effect and then drop the acid to time the peak of that to hit when my favorite DJs go on.

I would imagine 1mg of DOC would add not much more to an LSD experience but extra peripheral stimulation ... but can't wait to hear how it goes ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I have a question. I have done mushrooms a bunch of times, and acid 5 times. Of the 5 times I've done acid, only 2 of those experiences were full-out +++. I am wondering how the experience of DOC differs from the experience of LSD, and is there anything I should do differently in preparation for a DOC trip vs an LSD trip? Especially when it comes to tripping on DOC with maybe 8-10 people.

While I find LSD at party to be great and a lot of fun, I'd not say the same for DOC. I find DOC less social and less rewarding in low dose than LSD. You should take in consideration that DOC take ~2h30 to fully come up while LSD take 30'-60'.


I find that the best way to take DOC is in small social setting with 2-3 friends in a beautiful place, dosing pretty high.

DOC is actually allows me to be more social and coherent than LSD. Once the peak ends and the long wind-down / afterglow phase begins its pretty much party time.


Of course this depends on the dose, how you react, and other factors.


Epsilon, to prepare for DOC I'd prepare almost the same as with LSD. Except give yourself an extra 12 hours before needing to sleep, or have some benzos handy. Personally I can sleep 10-12 hours into DOC and then wake up still tripping lightly, but some people remain wired for as much as 30+ hours after dosing.


Drink water lightly but frequently throughout the trip, avoid caffeine and eat healthy before the trip. You may be like me and find DOC to be one of the smoothest feeling psychedelics.

Awesome, thanks! 


I do not have access to benzos, or any real prescription sleep aid at this time. I have tried to abort a 6g mushroom trip with 50mg of diphenhydramine, and that was probably about the worst idea ever. I am wondering if anyone has any experience in using doxylamine succinate to go to sleep while tripping. Is this strong enough to actually put you out from the amphetamine stimulation of the DOC, or is it just generally a bad idea to mix a deleriant and a psychedelic under any circumstances? I have never taken doxylamine succinate, but I have taken a lot of benadryl, and I understand doxylamine is supposed to be stronger.

You seem to react to DOC in exactly the same way as me, BD, down to being able to sleep lightly about 10-12 hours in and wake up in the afterglow/plateau.  Party time certainly describes the second stage of DOC. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


I wouldn't count on it though.  I've done DOC a lot and at first I certainly could not sleep for well over 24 hours. But the second half of the trip has always been fantastic... it turns me into a euphoric social animal.

Hmm, I can't say for DOC, but for 2C-E and dexamphetamine, doxlamine presented no problems. Only have about 10-20mgs though...

I am wondering if on DOC you get this phenethylamine solar plexus warm head buzz? Do you know what I mean? I think for me at least its where the majority of the euphoria comes from when using phens...it feels so good (I get this on t7, 2CE, 2CD, 2CB).


Does it happen with DOC? Its the main reason I want to combine it with LSD.

solar plexus head buzz?

can u elaborate.

im not sure that makes any sense.


on LSD i do get this buzzing energy in my solar plexus.

seems to happen with most psychs for me.

i think its anxiety, but the good kind, like when you're excited for something.

yes i think close to that (good stimulation/anxiety). i think its something like your whole body begins to feel like its covered in warm tingly fur? do you know what I mean? it begins with your body/lower torso and ascends into head (eventually causing pin prickling on scalp).

Gaian Planes... DOC doesn't feel like any 2C-x or much like mescaline either. I find it far more transparent. The feeling for me is of a calm and focused energy flowing throughout me. I actually find it more comfortable than most LSD trips.


A "smooth dose" for me is any dose I've tried, between 0.2mg and 6mg. I find about 3-4mg to be ideal.

I remember someone saying they took DOC for a long time as a study aid/stimulant.  I think they took lower doses, 1mg and below.  It was here that I read this.  If you search around you might be able to find it.  They said it was pretty effective.


DOC is one of my favorites.  I can only describe the head feeling as mental candy.  I can almost taste it inside my brain, and it is a similar taste to lsd.  I don't know if that makes much sense, but that's the only way I can describe it.  I love the feeling it gives my body.  It is extremely euphoric.  The only downside is that it makes me puke nearly every time, but I prefer to take 6mg or more.  Then again, I always take it in a liquid solution, and liquid solutions tend to make me puke for some reason.  


I would like to try and plug some, or maybe snort it.  Hell, I have even heard of people smoking it.  If that was proven to be safe, I might consider trying it, but I have heard some of the 2c-x compounds can change into carcinogens when you smoke them so I wouldn't want to risk it.


All this talk about DOC makes me want to test it again.  It has been a while, and it is great stuff.  Very similar to LSD IMO, but with more of a body buzz.  Very pleasant though.  It kicks in fast for me.  I feel it within t + 15 minutes, and I am puking by t +30 minutes, 45 minutes top.  It only takes a little while longer to manifest itself than lsd does.  I would like to take some at an event, but the puking has turned me away from that.  I would need to be near a trashcan for the come up.  Maybe plugging would eliminate the purge......dunno.  Only further experimentation will determine the truth.

iv had great fun puking on DOC at festivals. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


i tend to also puke with DOC, which is one of the reasons i dont enjoy it. 

It's shame, since i heard so many great things about it.

Iv tried it at doses from 3-6mg, and never found anything special about it.


I have the same opinion of DOI.


perhaps DOM will be different for me.

I have to say that 7mg of DOC nasally sounds like an irresponsible act - not only will the peak from 7mg be extremely intense (phenethylamines don't seem to follow a linear dose-effect relationship, 2C-E being one of the more noticable compounds exhibiting this * ), but the come up would be far faster and likely to really unsettle most users. Anybody with no/limited experience with DOC should not exceed 2mg and stick to oral ingestion or there's a more than significant risk of becoming one of Erowid's train wreck trips (remember if it goes bad, you're locked into it for a good 10 hours minimum, longer than just about any other commonly available psychedelic)


* - going from 15mg to 20mg with 2C-E is a world of difference, so when you consider that a fully active dose of DOC is 1-1.5mg, taking 7mg is just asking for trouble in the unfamiliar user (5x the fully active dose of 2C-E ie around the 75mg mark is a nightmare waiting to happen)

DOC tabs are doing the rounds in Australia, I was lucky enough to drop two last Sunday night.


Come-up took at least two hours and then I plataeud for around 7 hours at least, got some sleep, woke up feeling fantastic and buzzed which lasted for a few more hours. The longevity was something I really liked, so hopefully sometime in the future DOM will come around; the longer the better!

i've had doc a few times now, and while i've enjoyed it each time i still find it a bit too heavy mentally than the 2C's and makes me a bit too restless and fidgety. It normally only lasts about 8-10 hours for me, but i find myself slightly bored when beginning to come down. Its fun stuff, but I prefer 2cc so i can redose through the night. and i prefer 2ce if i'm just having one dose of something, thats entertaining enough for me and i love the time-fuck things it does to me(had some crazy deja-vu experiences when on 2ce!)

I took ~2mg in a 2mg/ml solution yesterday and had an absolute blast. Very visual, very very sedating and relaxed. I would say the sedation and slight nystagmus are the only two big differences that distinguish this compound from LSD in effects. 


I am excited to try 3mg!

I was wondering if anyone knew how much of a HT2B agonist DOC is (it's affinity)?  I'm just trying to figure out how bad this is for your heart.  I think I've heard that DOI is 70% and DOB 100% if I remember right.


Can anyone explain to me how something being a heavy HT2B agonist causes damage to the heart and how bad the damage is?  Thank you!

^^^

from memory it does something to growth regulation in the heart valve which causes abnormalaties - thickening or uncontrolled growth or something of that nature. should be lots of info on it which you can extrapolate from phen-fen.


i have been thinking about highish dose DOC lately, perhaps around 3mg![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I'd call that a light/medium dose but that's just me.


Of course in the spirit of harm reduction I'd suggest anyone start below 1mg to test the waters or at least with around 2mg and be prepared for a possibly strong trip ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

i have always used psychs in a semi-responsible manner, never more than weekly (unless short acting) so my tolerance is still quit low, 2mg produced +3 effects for me.

3mg will def be a treat.

DOC at 3mg was very managable, say +2.5 I had no problem going to the post office etc. Sleep was possable at 12 hours. Very smooth. Ive only got 6mg left which Ill take all at once. 2.5mg DOB was mcuh stronger, in terms of bodyload and psychdelia, than 3mg of DOC. I prefer DOC immensly more than DOB even though I havent had a +3 with it yet

The first time I did it, I took what I thought to be ~1mg (in 1ml H2O/ethanol/DOC solution) to test the waters, and there were no effects to speak of.


It might be that I had made the solution too weak - I was aiming for 1mg/1ml, but I don't trust my scale too much so maybe I was a bit too conservative. Anyway, the 2nd and 3rd time were done with the same solution. 


Second time - around 5 days later - 2ml at around 9:00 in the morning. Waited until about 12, and when nothing much had happened took 2ml more. Now this worked ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) A very mild and pleasant trip, came in waves and lasted until sometime early in the next morning. Tracers, patterns on walls moving in strange ways, etc. The exploding stars were really nice to watch ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


Third time - 3 or 4 days after the second time - 5ml of said solution around 10am - tracers for several hours, but nothing more... Went to sleep around 1-2am with no problem. A buddy took the same amount at the same time, with no effects whatsoever, according to him.


I was even doubting if this might have been something other than DOC, but the length of the first (successful) trip, I think, should pretty much confirm that it is real. Also, I'm sure there was some sort of tolerance because of the short time between trials, and also cross-tolerance with a number of other substances... (methylone, butylone, mdpv, mushrooms, weed, alcohol...) - not taken at the same time of course, but on consecutive days. Lack of sleep could have contributed as well. It was a case of "too much stuff to try out, too little time". 


Now I'm waiting for a suitable time to take the last 5ml of the solution. Hoping for a stronger experience this time. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

about two months ago i had my first DOC trip, dosage would be 2mg, maybe a bit less.


it was about 2am in the morning when i did it and i had some amphetamine and some beer before (i know, not the most responsible thing to do, but it was a caught-in-the-moment decision and i knew this would be the last opportunity to do it for the next weeks because of my work)


i also had a sitter, who only had amphetamines and some pot. 10mins after ingestion we decided to go to the 24h-shop to get something to drink. i made the fatal mistake to forget my keys (i dont attribute that to the DOC, 10mins in would be too short for that) and well it was middle of the night, my sitter living too far away to be an option to drive to and it was cold.

so there i was, middle of night, no way to get that frickin door open and coming up on a very potent psychedelic i never had taken before. murphy someone? ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

as i didnt wanted to pay the nightshift-fee for some lock-emergency service we basically had to wait there for like 4-5hours.

so yeah, some fucked up setting there ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


anyway, i felt the first effects about 40mins after ingestion and i think at T+90M i had the first visual effects.


three hours into it i reached the peak, or more a plateu, which then lasted for about seven hours. It was a pretty solid ++ experience, allthough i guess the setting somehow dampened the strength somewhat.


at about T+17h i reached the point where i could say "ok this is finished now" but still it kept me from falling asleep so i had to take a few benzos (had only lorazepam at hand which doesnt work that good for falling asleep for me) but then sleep was no issue, woke up slightly exhausted but no real hangover (apart from the benzo hangover) after some 12h sleep.


did i like it? yeah pretty much, the setting was not exactly helpful for my mood but i had no real problems with it as i found that it gave me some quite profound mood-lifting buzz and body high which actually reminded me a bit of methamphetamine (had that only 3 times in my life in lowish dosages).

the psychedelic headspace was kindof *fluffy* (for a lack of a better word for it) and the visuals were pretty and sortof stylish to look at. 


what i also really liked was the real smooth slow but steady comeup, you dont get jumped at and have all the time to slowly find your way into the experience, id go as far to say that of all the psychedelics i did in my life (quite a few 2c's, all the "oldschool"-tryptamines) this has the best comeup-phase.


what i didnt like was the the duration, the plateu was just like 1-2hours too long, i got tired of that "psychedelic stimulation" in my head but just when i was about to seriously enter the "ok, this sucks!"-headspace it entered the "second phase", the long and slow but steady comedown, which was really relaxed and chilled. at the end though i kind of crashed a bit, not really mental, more like total exhaustion (it reminded me of the meth-comedown as well).

allthough i think i felt some vasoconstriction and had some chest pain issues, but these might have been psychosomatic, allthough the benzos i did at the end did not really made it better, which i would expect if it had been psychosomatic.

i also think that the fact i was already up almost one day before i ingested it and that i did some amphetamines before might have contributed to it, especially considering that my lifestyle is not the healthiest and at that time did alot of amphetamine at least once a week, including the FR->SU up and running and dancing and going to work chore.

i would be interested if someone else had this combination as well and could comment on that.


would i do it again? yes. but not in the near future, probably not even this year. and also i'd do it sober in the morning after breakfast, looks like the way to go with this substance for me. next dosage would be 2,5mg methinks.


uh, got quite large this post, and is probably the first trip report i wrote for like nine years ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

**DOC and xanax, I have an idea that im hoping you can help with?**


Ok, well ive always had alot of fun on psychedelics and even the trips that were a little hard at times were still wicked trip at other points in the trip. But last friday I tripped on 2C-T-7 and it was unlike any other trip ever and was really scary. I dont know if I took too much, if my mindset had something to do with it or thats just how 2C-T-7 and if thats the case then I definitely dont like T7, If I had xanax things probably would have gone much better but I was too far gone to walk 50 metres away to get a xanax off my friend. Ill add that im not new to psych's, high dose LSD(thatproduces a much strong but much more comfortable headfuck and visuals) is something I love, Salvia didnt phase me but I still liked it, done mushies, ketamine, DXM, 2C-I which I loved and thought T7 would be more like 2C-I but it was nothing like it at all(except slighly similar body load but that wasnt the problem with T7)


BUT, I want to try DOC sometime in the near future and I dont want any experiences like I did with T7, I want it to go as well as possible. So I was thinking if I have a decent supply of xanax and took it along with the DOC would I still trip albeit much much milder and different or will it basically pointless?


Ill just say that im NOT looking for a special experience that is spiritual or too introspective, im just looking to test the substance and maybe get a few visuals and have a little fun with a very mild to non-existant headfuck.


It'd be good if someone could compare any of the drugs out of 2C-T-7, LSD, DOC and 2C-I. I dont meen compare them all to each other(although if you can that'd be great) but just one drug to the other in terms of intensity, visuals, mindfuck or introsepctive qualities, body load and general enjoyment.


Thanks a bunch to all you guys, im getting so much more interested in psychedelics rather than shooting up hard drugs everyday like I was used to, so thx ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

If you are looking for descriptions of the drugs the best way that you can find them is to read a bunch of different trip reports and information on here, Erowid, and elsewhere. But bottom lnie, it is a very individual thing. We really can't decide what drugs YOU should take, nor should we, that is an individual decision to be made in full knowledge of one's own chemistry, psychology, and the drugs one has at hand, etc. Good luck, though, in your quest to find "something better ..."

^^Thanks for merging this.


I am definitely going to try this stuff but just need a little guidance before I do it. I just dont want benzo's to completely ruin the trip and make it boring or not even really trip.

^ Keep the benzos on you for if the trip goes bad. Take them only when you really can't handle what's happening.


Maybe you should chill a little before your next trip, planning for a bad trip or being preoccupied with worrying about them makes them more likely in my experience.

^^Sounds like good advice. I was out surfing this morning having a think about it and while I do know ill definitely be trying it im in no hurry and I am still quite shaken from the T7 trip, I think ill give it a month or so and that just gives me more time to research. It was pretty dumb of me to do the T7 coz I did about 2 days research and the rest was just little bits of info gathered over the years.

^ Ah well, we all have those bad experiences that help us become more mature and responsible drug users along the way. 


Sometimes I'm unable to resist the urge to trip, even if my mindset isn't the best. ![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif)

I've had DOC on tabs a few times recently, it was less intense then acid but still intense... hard to explain, there was less of a mindfuck perhaps? The visuals were different as well, they were more intense then the ones I get from acid, a lot of patterning over my vision which at night made it hard to see. I don't really get introspective trips so can't comment there... the bodyload was quite stimulating, a bit too much sometimes but I felt really nice and overall each of my three trips has been great, a really enjoyable experience that I didn't have to 'work' for to get euphoria out of.

**Alternate methods of ingesting liquid solutions**


So I have DOC suspended in a liquid solution at 2mg/ml. I'm kinda tired of the time-frame  involved in tripping on DOC, so I have been thinking about insufflating/plugging a small amount of liquid. For reference, there is no alcohol in the solution, it is being stored in a cold environment for a short period of time.


Anyone have any experience with either of these methods?

Oral is plenty effecient with Dox's and the duration is just something you have to prepare for...

Just drink it.  You could plug it.  A slightly lower dose would be needed, dunno how much less though.  


Snorting it would be pretty hard.  You could empty it onto a pyrex plate and let the liquid evaporate, and snort what is left, but it will be such a minuscule amount it will be hard to retrieve.  You will probably end up losing the dose.

I have plugged DOC and it didn't seem to affect the duration or the come-up or the strength at all... it was identical to oral as far as I could tell.  I've never insufflated it but then again I love DOC exactly the way it is.  I think I will be having some today actually. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

After plugging it, the only differences I noticed were an extremely fast comeup (significant effects within 5 mins) a MUCH quicker onset of the peak, and length of peak, and totally down buy 12 hrs, which for me is significantly shorter, but only by about 6 hrs or so...


All in all, worth doing, peak was MUCH more intense than equal amounts orally, but that could be just from the speed and slightly potentiation....Probably won't repeat.

Yesterday I tried DOC for the first time at a dose of 4mg, and I was mostly at a moderate +++, at least for the peak of the effects. 


I enjoyed the trip overall, especially the strong visuals and other sensory effects, but I felt that it lacked any sense of spirituality, or mysticism, and it didn't even stimulate my thought process very much. 


Compared to other substances I've used like mushrooms, lsd, and 2c-e, DOC was enjoyable but it just made me space out and enjoy the imagery, as opposed to enjoying the imagery while thinking about things or having clever dialogue with my friends. Does anyone else that has tried DOC feel this way about it as well? I haven't seen anyone really mention this aspect of it one way or another.

bump. I'm interested too in hearing about whether people find the trip profound. I'm thinking of trying it for a low dose enhancer type drug...something to take on a long day outside chillin' beside a creek or pond in the sunshine...I was thinking about starting at 1.5mg for this effect.

I think in my one experience with DOC that the after-glow had potential for positive insight, because I was just brimming with truly good vibes. Just speculation, though...

I find DOC to be a powerful tool for channeling positivity and love and creativity, when used right.  The afterglow (actually the entire trip when a low dose is used) reliably puts me in a "state of grace" where I feel truly cognitively enhanced, and emotionally honest and open.  It's a zen-like state of peace and harmony where I feel that anything is possible.  My wife and I have had some very important growing days/discussions in such a state.  It's difficult for me to explain this state, but the more experience I have with it, as long as I don't overuse it, the more reliably I can bring it on.  About 1.5 to 2mg works the best, I find.  It just makes everything so positive and easy and "flowing".


I have tried DOB, DOC, DOI, DOM, and DOT (aleph-1), and DOC is the only one that produces this state for me.  It's been a very valuable tool for me, one that remains valuable.  Not as a way to trip balls or hallucinate (it used to do a great job with that but no longer does), but as a way to open myself up mentally and emotionally in an honest and productive way.

^interesting.


I've only tried DOC once (~1.8mg) and I found the stimulation uncomfortable, but at that point I hadn't any experience with stimulants (aside from caffeine that is).


Over the last year or so I've been using desoxypipradrol and modafinil periodically and find them to be very useful productivity enhancers.


I think my body has become much more comfortable with stimulants so I think its time to go back to DOC.


I'm hoping low dose DOC can provide a similar 'enhancement' as these milder stimulants, but with a little extra 'magic' if you know what I mean...

DOC feels too artificial and dirty for me.


The visuals look dirty, things look more detailed in an OCD kinda way. Sure the visuals are pretty intense, they are definetly intense in a different way than LSD.


I always feel like DOx's are too much for my body to handle.


I prefer LSD, LSD lets me see beautiful things and not feel so anxious like DOC(and DOX)

It took a while for my body to really "accept" DOC fully.  I always loved it, obviously, except the first time I took it at 2.25mg... it felt all strange and alien.  Then I took it at 3.2mg and loved it.  Back then it gave me a massively powerful trip, with overwhelming visuals and a peri9od of feeling a bit too intense (but in that psychedelic sort of way that I can find enjoyment in).  After the first trip, it always provided this state that I mentioned, although not as profoundly, but not until like hour 8 to 10, after the main trip.  


As time went on and I continued to use it more, I stopped tripping so hard on it.  I started to more reliably get this "state of grace".  I started using a lot of psychedelics, so I got in the habit of taking a low dose the day after a full dose (1-1.5mg for me then - a low dose probably would have been .5-.75mg when I started), to conitnue this day-after state longer.  Then I took a long break from psychedelics and when I started using them again, I decided to try a 1.5mg dose instead of a full one, and it was great.  So that's how I came to find it.


I should also mention that I often like to combine it with phenibut... it adds an edge to the euphoria that I really love, and it makes you much less likely to have to endure a period of initial anxiety for 2 or 3 hours (which sometimes happens even with low doses without it).

So i've had a bit of an encounter with the DOx's in the past year or so.

I have done a few hits of acid ranging from a half tab my first time, up to 4 good tabs.

A while ago I got my hands on tabs from a friend of a friend sort of thing i got two of these tabs, took 1 and a half and gave the other half to a friend. Both of us were gone for the next ~30 hours. It was dirty but really opened my mind alot. Would like to get my hands on it again but take a lower dose, the body load was terrible. From my reading of Erowid and Phikal im pretty sure these tabs were DOB.


I have also been sold recently tabs which i'm pretty sure are DOC as they match all of the writings about them. Done these tabs two times now + both times really enjoyed the trip but find them to leave me alot more shaken up the day after.


It's not something i'm happy about really I would quite like to be able to know this is what your getting and feel confident in the actual chemical present. 


But hey that seems to be new zealand for everyone I know.

I think I answered it in one of my posts - maybe not though.


Anyway, I've only plugged once and it was during a period of abuse where I had dosed it the two days previous as well, so to be honest I couldn't tell... I was already on another dose at the time.  I couldn't perceive a difference but it doesn't mean there wasn't one.  I think Obyron might have said he plugged DOI but I can't remember what his conclusion was, or even whether or not I'm imagining that.

I'm confused, Xorky.


I thought your DOC was kratom.

Anyone experience vasoconstriction on  low doses of DOC?  I've had one, low dose (I'm generally hard headed with all TIHKALS AND PIHKALS) of 2mg., experience with DOC as a taste test to gauge my appropriate dose and interest in the compound.  At 2 mg. I only obtained some vague threshold sense of activity, but ended up having very cold hands and feet, as well as a general chill through much of the day.  Granted, it was subfreezing outside and no more than 60-62 f. indoors, but that's normal for me and I don't tend to get that way.  This has left me somewhat concerned about how I would be effected by a likely effective dose of 3-6 mg.

I believe Xorkoth has successfully dealt with this issue by coadministering l-arginine. It is a vaso-dilator and is very benign otherwise (its an amino acid).

It usually does take a while for peoples bodies to get used to anal sodomy. I hate to say it, however after extensive experience with a large array of psychedelics, DOC is an ineffective psychedelic, anti-depressant or stimulant.


I'm not denying various anecdotal experiences, I am saying relatively speaking from comparison with other various compounds.

Well just because it's ineffective for you doesn't mean it's ineffective for everyone.  I've tried just about everything there is to try and it remains one of the most effective substances I've used.  Clearly, though, for you it is not.

note about l-arginine - I had awful DOC vasoconstriction, and I think l-arginine took the edge off but it also made me pee worryingly often (I also took it when sober sometimes). evne when there was no more urine, it still felt like I needed to urinate... scary.


because of that I usually only take a half tab of l-arginine.

I notice a DRASTIC difference in the come-up time myself, normally within 5 mins I am already feeling significant effects (However, the only times I have plugged DOC have been 4 and 6.5mg doses). I haven't logged a trip in detail, but the peak also hits much more quickly. Normally I am still slightly tripping at about +10-12 hrs.


In regards to potency, I find plugging to be much more intense than equal amounts orally. However, this may be caused by the much quicker onset and peak.

have you tried arginine on its own before and did it produce this effect for you? It usually causes my dick to get a little larger when flacid...maybe it was just that triggering your 'pee instinct' (lol :D)

If I were to try DOC for the first time at a festival (first DOx) Would I be able to do other drugs on it?


I was thinking of dosing 1mg in the morning, 


during the day I would have access to mephedrone, ketamine, hashish,mdma,cocaine, 2C-B/E and booze. I would probably want to do some of these drugs (deff the ket ,hash, meph and booze).


Bad idea or not?

I liked DOC id like to get some more. My last experiance with it, I ate two tabs of some good lsd and then 3 hours into the lsd i ate 6mg of DOC. One hell of a ride let me tell you, but DOC was very easy on my body even at 6mg, and i was kind of out of it the next day but i had taken a decent ammount of xanax to fall asleep like 12 hours after taking the DOC...It was crazy intense, but definately something i would like to try again. I cant wait to get my hands on some more. and whats so nice is 100mg - 200mg will last me a long stinking time. :D

l-arginine - what dose at what body weight has been effective for counteracting the vasoconstriction from DOC.  If someone experienced this with DOC, would it be safe to assume they'd have a similar side effect from DOM?

Not necessarily - the DOXs have different levels of vasoconstriction.  DOB has it the most, followed by DOC.  DOI doesn't give it to me as badly as DOC.  I don't remember getting any from DOM but I'm sure it has some vasoconstrictive properties.


L-arginine - I usually take 1-2 grams of it.  I would think 2 grams would be enough for anyone but I could be wrong.  I weigh 150.

Did anybody mix doc with 2c-e or other 2c-x? Any comments?

It's alright.  The DOC overpowers the 2C-Xs though.


I finally ran out of DOC.  500mg lasted me over 3 years though.  I'm sad!  I may have to sagve up and get more... it's my favorite tool and recreational substance.


DOC gives me vasoconstriction and used to give me too much... the key is to moderate your usage to not too often, keep your doses down, and take some L-arginine to dilate your blood vessels.  Also being warm during the trip helps with that.

did you find doing yoga or some type of calisthenics help? This probably is much safer to do BEFORE you get the constriction. I'll never get the image out of my mind (shudder) of you talking about fearing to stretch out all the way because some veins might snap.


Even now....jesus...


*shudder*


thats a wicked image man :D

Yeah ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)  It was crazy.  It never happens anywhere near that bad anymore, fortunately.  That was when I was doing it a lot more often.

Oh that certainly could explain some of the side effects I get from DOC, always reminded me of LSA in that aspect. And you say L-Arginine helps, Xorkoth? 

That now makes sharing of the magic more troublesome as I do not want anyone to suffer health-wise while on a psychedelic. 

That is actually a shattering sad news for me, as I thought I finally found my lucy surrogate, because of all the rc's I have tried it feels the closest to L.

Hello friends.  Thanks to *a passing pixie*, I have what I'm told is about 17mg of DOC and tomorrow night is going to be the last time I get to try it for about 6 months.  I'm already too curious and 6 months just sounds way too long to withhold from an initial trial.  To be fair, I have already tested somewhere around .1mg to look for any weird reactions.  Nothing happened and no reason to fear raising the dose.

So my plan.  Friday night, I'm going to see a show followed by a late night show and DOC just seems like the right kinda substance to keep me going strong.  I have plenty of experience with psychs in public and really, the people I'll be around are gonna be just as batshit as myself.  The question is really dosage and timing. The show starts at 9:00 Friday night.  Judging from the length of come-up which doesn seem to be very long, and this readily apparent 4 hour mood shift, I'm thinking the dose should be ingested no later than 5:00 in the afternoon.  Does that sound reasonable?

Dosage.  I've just got over a two week tryptamine crush and so my tolerance may be somewhat elevated.  I'm not sure how DOC crosses with something like 4-Aco-DMT though.  I'm thinking 3-3.5mg.  As I said, I'm pretty experienced with all levels of experience.  The thing I'm most worried about is getting freaked out by the vasoconstriction as I'm quite the hypochondriac.  I've invested in L-arginine for daily use and started a few days ago and will continue on past this experience.  Please advise.  Thank you.

DOC shouldn't have cross-tolerance with tryptamines, at least not significant.  Have you ever tried a DOX before?  3-3.5mg might be pretty intense, but provided you're used to strong experiences you should probably be fine.


Regarding timing, I'd time it for the comeup to be about 2 hours... you'll start feeling it much sooner though.  It's going to last a LONG time... hopefully you'll have people to hang out with or at least something to do afterwards and don't plan to sleep.  Hour 8 and on is when it starts getting especially social in nature... it's probably my favorite part.


Definitely keep using that arginine and you should be fine physically. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Thanks for the info Xorkoth, it was pretty helpful.  I wound up taking about 2.8mg there abouts, maybe as high as 3 though certainly nothing more.  The come up left me feeling a little nausea but it wasn't terrible.  I was enjoying the subtle visuals while on the subway.  What was really horrible was the numbness in my butt cheeks.  It started about three hours after ingestion (sublingual).  Even with the L-arginine, the vasoconstriction got to me; i think I took about 2.4grams of the stuff before giving up.  The feeling reminded me way too much of Bromo-Dragonfly and so, while I wasn't at all panicked, I just wasn't having fun.  I wound up taking 2mg of clonazepam just to lighten my mood and loosen me up and it worked wonders.  Had a blast after that.  The DOC was still stimulating enough to keep the K-pin from knocking me on my ass.  I guess the DOx family and it's derivatives just aren't for me.  I might try it again in the distant future but for now, it is retired. 

Thanks again for the help.

Well glad you had a blast at some point.  If you ever do try it again, you might try a lower dose, like 1.5 or 1.75mg.  I usually use this sort of dose nowadays for a much lighter trip that still contains that euphoric, social tail end plateau I mentioned.  The vasoconstriction is less and it's generally lighter.  Also, there's a supplement you can buy legally called phenibut, which is a GABAergic substance that lasts a long time and is a bit benzo-like, a bit reminiscent of GHB... basically it loosens you up and makes you feel talkative and nice.  I often take a dose of that, say 1.5-2 grams, to combine with low-dose DOC... nice combo, more euphoric and it cuts a bit of the weird feeling that DOC can have at first.


Anyway, glad to have helped a bit. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I'd imagine he just meant a "true" full-on psychedelic as opposed to some of the lighter ones - 2C-B, for example.

^ Thank you

But doesn't that seem redundant when he had already called it an archetypal psychedelic earlier on in the  pihkal entry?


Does anyone have experience with combining DOC and 2C-T-2 or a 4-sub tryptamine?

Pretty much redundant, but it's not that unusual for people to get a bit creative when describing things, I suppose. There's any number of words and phrases he could have used so I presume he just wanted to not say "archetypal" again and chose that one cos he liked it. Doubt there's any deeper meaning to it.

I would say that 2.5-3.5mg would be a great dose for a festival.

Agreed.  I'd probably go for 2.5 or 3 at most... 3.5 for me would be a bit more than I'd want at a festival.

i remember eating 5 or 6mg at a festival 4 years ago.

Not recomended but i certainly had a great time.


I was Listening to Ween for the first time while dosed out on DOC. I wasnt sure whether to believe what i was hearing or not.

Good times....

DOC is definately a good festival drug, but go with the doses recomended above.

I would not combine at all.  DOC isn't that stimulating usually... in fact I find it relaxing most of the time.  But cocaine would mix badly I think.  Just feels like it, though I've never tried it.


Gotta say... today I got my first true taste of DOM, and I think it's bumped DOC off the top spot for my favorite substance.  But I still love DOC too. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Are you sure they didnt call it lsd? thats curious......lol


  Thats how you get scammed.


All the lsd I ever bought was lsd aside from two types of RC filled gel-tabs(and gel tabs are usually made by the best).

and yes I can tell the fucking difference ya custies.


I love the dox chems, but its nothing like lsd.


Custies fuck up the whole thing.

They cant tell the difference between mda and lsd for gods sake, so why not sell them to other cust as such?.


Its sad.

After my first and only very lackluster trial with DOC a few years back (~1.8mg) I decided to give it a go this time (~2.5mg). I decided the spend the first bit in a nearby park reading, but I ended up spending close to 4 hours there, just reading, relaxing and meditating.


The come up was extremely smooth, and I felt no discomfort being in a public space.


There wasn't much in the way of visuals, only the minor standard psychedelic breathing. I felt quite connected to nature and noticed my vision was much improved. Other have described it better, but its like your eyes are taking much higher resolution pictures.


It wasn't until the sun had almost set and I stood up to go home that I felt the energy. It was like a constant stream throughout my body, but not uncomfortable in any way.


I got home watching a video or two on the computer and by that time most of the psychedelic effects had subsided and I was left with a very clean stimulant feeling.


Originally years ago reading the reports on DOC I was particularly intrigued by one of Blue Dolphins reports where he mentioned an enhanced musical ability. I found this too. I'm more of a guitar player, but I played piano better than I probably ever have in my life. My fingers were free and seemed to know where to go without thought. Unlike other drugs like LSD with seem to enhance creative potential, but hinder execution and motor skills (at least for me), DOC, if anything appears to improve motor skills.


I took the the DOC around 4pm (should've started earlier) and went to bed around 5am. I probably layed around for hours as I still felt residual stimulation, but there wasn't any 'cracked out' feeling I get with other psychedelics. I had plenty of Xanax on hand but decided against taking any. I woke up 6 hours after I went to bed and probably with half of that being actual sleep and felt tired, but otherwise quite good. 


I can feel a bit of a motivational lift today as well, like I'm on a very low dose of a stimulant.


With my LSD supply almost gone and after accidentally throwing out a good portion of my 'stash' when I moved, I think DOC is my new 'Drug Of Choice'. Next time I'll probably try a little bit higher, closer to 3mg and start earlier in the day.

There is a chance the dose may not be exact. The vial was a few years old, so there is the possibility of some degradation.


I'll likely try it again within a week or so. I generally HATE coming up on psychedelics but DOC is so slow and smooth I didn't mind it at all.

Glad you experienced the energy. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  That energy plateau is probably my favorite feeling of any drug.  It's somehow so smooth and clean and benign... I can be up for 2 days and feel 100% the whole time (obviously I need to sleep afterwards).  Great, great drug.  I can get some really tremendous euphoria from that energy too.  Incidentally phenibut at the right dose during DOC has some pretty intense euphoria/empathogenic potential.  It's a very useful state (both DOC and DOC + phenibut).

i've been sitting with a vial of this for over a year and the good weather is making me want to give it a try.. i haven't even opened it yet.  


how off-putting has the vaso-contriction been to people redosing? would it be a factor that put you off doc for good?  i don't have any l-argenine unfortunately.


i'm familiar with the 2c-e bodyload, is the load anyway comparable?

^ This is not something you ever 'redose.'  If you have a solid day and a half that you want to spend tripping, I would recommend just committing to a decent dose of DOI or simply taking a slightly higher dose of DOC--7.5-8mg will **not** leave you wanting to redose, period.  I find the peripheral effects of DOC to be almost non-existant: it is the most peripherally translucent psychedelic amphetamine and for me, has far fewer 'ants in the pants' than 2C-E.

**DOC + Urination?**


After taking DOC again today I noticed a similar effect as last time.


Basically around 9-11 hours after taking the DOC my body seems to produce a lot of urine ![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif)


Has anyone else noticed this or have more information on why this happens?


I found this thread:

[http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/showthread.php?p=4688451](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/showthread.php?p=4688451)


but not much else.


The only thing I can think of is that it causes a depletion of vasopressin or something.

Yeah, I guess I do notice that now that you mention it.  I often urinate frequently though... probably due to my rate of kratom consumption.  So it's hard to say.

Amphetamine itself is very diuretic, it doesn't seem too far-fetched to assume the psychedelic varieties are as well. Although I've never tried DOC so I cannot attest from personal experience. I have, however, used a lot of DOI and did notice some diuretic qualities (although nothing too extreme).

My recent experience with ~3.1mg was MUCH more intense than the ~2.5 I tried previously. 


The come up was still relatively smooth, and relaxing. During this come up I found myself doing more thinking and psychological 'work', which while not necessarily fun, felt beneficial.


After I left the park I was in and came home t +3 the visuals became very noticeable . Everything was breathing and swirling. It felt a bit like 2C-B in that while the visuals were intense, mentally it was very controllable. 


The stimulation was more noticeable as well and even though I was still quite relaxed (I almost could have fell asleep if I really wanted to) I could see how some could find it uncomfortable and  found myself doing some yoga postures and stretching which helped the energy 'flow'.


Overall it was quite rewarding, but after I had mostly come down I noticed an alarming diuretic effect. Every 20-30 minutes I was emptying a FULL bladder. 


![piss2.gif](https://www.bluelight.org/community/proxy.php?image=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gearslutz.com%2Fboard%2Fimages%2Fsmilies%2Fpiss2.gif&hash=da8a84dcb283e45d711f76150ca59b69)


The residual psychedelic effects probably made me more concerned and I did briefly consider seeking medical attention, but decided against it and seeked more information online. My main concern was my electrolyte/salt balance and discovered that lemon juice + salt + water tastes EXACTLY like Gatorade, and probably works just as well ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


Anyway, I remembered research I had read that both psychedelics and amphetamines can cause greatly increased vasopressin release (likely why its so hard to piss at the peak of a trip) and depletion and since I had long ago thrown out my desmopressin I figured that some b-vitamins and methyl donors (trimethylglycine + cofactors) probably wouldn't hurt my pituitary in producing more. Placebo or not, I felt that at least I was doing something...


After approximately 3 hours of urinating every 20-30 minutes, the pace slowed to about every hour which lasted until the next morning, but which was much less alarming.


Before I take DOC again I'd like to know more about the diuretic effect and make sure there aren't any significant risks involved. It would be a real shame to have to shelve it though, since I like it almost as much as LSD...

I don't think that vasopressin release is responsible for the difficult urination.  If anything, vasopressin is preventing the accumulation of urine.  But since it's so hard to pee but you do still feel the sensations of a full bladder, the more likely candidate is excessive sympathetic activation which is important in the filling & retention phase of the bladder while a parasympathetic response is necessary for emptying.  I don't know, just a thought.

i just got DOC from a friend of a friend today and was wondering about what to expect. He says that it's 4 mg's but who can really be sure about that, i didn't see him drop it onto the "blotter" he gave me (it was literally a 1.5" x 1.5" piece of what looked like illustration board) nor do i know if thats how he got it originally.


However the friend who referred me to him is really good friends with this guy and is very experienced with hallucinogens and has gotten this from him before and said he saw him drop it onto the same type of thing i got. 


Eitherway, who knows for sure if it's actually 4 mg's. But let's just say it really is 4 mg's, what should i expect from a dosage like this? From what i've read on this thread that seems like a pretty high dose. I've done shrooms three times but have never done lsd. The friend who's very experienced with hallucinogens said that DOC's like lsd but not as intense.


Also, i was wondering how sensitive this stuff is to light. It was wrapped in tinfoil but my curiosity/excitement got the better of me and i unwrapped it to look at it but it was only under the light for 30 seconds or so (light source being a ceiling light).

DOC isn't very sensitive to light at all.  It's extremely stable... stored properly it could last longer than a human lifespan.  I've stored mine at room temperature for long periods of time and it's just fine.


4mg is pretty strong... I'd do 3mg probably.  Save the 1mg for another time because a low dose is actually very nice, once you know what to expect from a full dose.

How am I supposed to eye out 3 mg's when it's already dropped on something? i can't see the wet mark anymore though, should i just cut it in half?


Also, it has a very bad odor to it, almost like bug spray or something...i don't think that's normal. but than again idk.

I got some kind of mystical experience from 4.4mg...4mg is strong.


You can put your blotter in a measured amount of water, the DOC will dissolve. Then, measure out 3 mg.

wait, i'm supposed to take this piece of cardboard, let it sit in water for a while than somehow eye out 3 mg's? i thought that it was a bad idea to eye out dosages with water.

so i cut the blotter in half and took half of it, saving the other half for later. i was able to see very, very faintly an outline of where it was dropped and it took up the entire thing almost so that'll be fairly 2 mg's, if not, oh well.....either get a more powerful experience or gentler euphoric one.


expect a trip report soon ![(:](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) i'm very excited for this stuff to start kickin' in.


I'm planning on going over to a friends house, he just got a new hookah and a bunch of different flavors and we're just gonna chill and watch movies.


how does DOC affect appetite? he's wanting me to throw down for a pizza but i'd think since this is an amphetamine that my appetite would be surpressed and also it's pretty common among all psychedelics from what i've heard.

very upset, waited an hour and a half after i took the first half, didn't feel anything, so I took the other half. Me and a friend watched a movie for a bit than we went out to dinner and even after then it didn't work. Once again, very upset ):


I'm thinking about getting some more this weekend, I know, probably a dumb decision but it's worth a shot.


I've been taking 5-htp 100 mg's two times daily for a week and took one today, could that have anything to do with it?

well i'm taking two daily because that's what it says on the bottle.....i use it as a sleep-aid and mild anti-depressant.


there was supposedly 4 mg's of it on the blotter so I cut it in half, put it under my tounge for a minute than sucked on it for five minutes. waited an hour and a half and took the other 2 mg's.

i've always wanted so bad to try DOC but the sources i keep on finding are all freaking scams.

always love reading reports about DOC though.. guess it will be a long while for me or not at all to be able to try this compound.. damn i wish i could trip for 24 hours..

Its really closer to 10-12 solid hours and then trailing off and not being able to sleep for quite some time. I used to love DOC. Then once I started taking DOM I thought the rest of the DOx drugs were crap. These days, staying messed up for that long is just too much. At times I do like drawn-out trips, but the lingering lack of sleep really bothers me. I don't particularly want to have to drug myself with depressants at T+14hrs to have a chance of sleep that day, and if I don't, I'm off for days to come.

Don't dismiss all other DOx compounds - DOT (aleph-1) is well worth trying, just for it's uniqueness. Agree that DOM is far better than DOC/B/I though. DOET sounds v. interesting as well

To me visuals are pretty much near the bottom of what I look for in a psychedelic.  It's that heart opening, therapeutic euphoria that takes the number one spot.  In that case I've heard DOC likely the best one out of the DOx's.  DOM seems more like what you said, more visual, more headtrip sort of stuff.

DOM and DOET are by far my fav DOX.....with DOC a close third. Its strange, DOET has always seemed closer to 2C-D and DOM closer to 2C-E, where i would expect the inverse to be true......the ol' SAR predictions are just such. predictions.:D

Yeah, for me, DOC is definitely more heart-opening than DOM.  DOM is lighter though and has considerably less bodyload.  DOM has a more logical focus, and more energy.  DOC actually seems to produce just as much or nearly as much of a cognitive boost too, but just a bit different.


DOC and phenibut is possibly my favorite combo.  Thought you might find that compelling. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

got some of this coming soon, was looking forward to doing it but then read it can cause bad vascoconstriction, a bit like bromo-drgfly can, is this true? I really hope not as i get so paranoia with that sort of thing and would send me into a bad trip.


Also ill have plenty of valium and gbl for afterwards, would they help chill me out if it got to instead like they can do with acid/2c's, cheers.

DOC can cause vasconstriction, but not as badly as DOB or DOB-dragonfly, nor as bad as DOI.  If you're nervous, take a gram of L-arginine like 6-8 hours before, and then like 500mg more like an hour before.  It's an amino acid that dilates the blood vessels.

If i wanted to try a low dose where i may possibly be around straight people alot, would 1/1.5mg actually give me any visuals at all?

You've tried DOET? You're like the third person I've heard about, apart from the comments in PIHKAL! So by comparing it to 2CD are you saying it's 'lighter' than DOM? I always imagined DOM would be similar, same with 2CE. I should really try them and find out ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

hey guys, sat morning (here in uk) i did 2mg doc, had a nice trip, te visuals dropped off around 10 hours, yesterday morning i did the last 1mg which did nothing but an uncomfortable body buzz, feel back to baseline now, safe to have a few small lines of mephedrone later do you think (obviously meph is dangerous but im just having a few to wake me up ![:p](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png))

I'm not sure where to put this... so I'm putting it in both possible threads.


Does anyone have any personal experience dissolving DOC in dH2O? I've read mostly that it dissolves very well... some saying as high as 33mg/ml... But I also have just read a few reports of it not wanting to dissolve in water at all.


I see it being pretty soluble in water, really. 2c-c was very soluble in water and amphetamines are generally water soluble.. I don't know why this one wouldn't be... but after a report of some kid being a dumbass and drinking part of a half dissolved solution of 25mg and having a very very intense trip. The kid said he kept adding water and it just wasn't dissolving right.  I just want to be certain before attempting to make a solution.


Any solid first hand remarks anyone can offer to me? If you have put it into dH2O, how soluble did it seem? ethanol remarks are welcome for contrast as well.


Thanks!

In my experience, it formed a complete solution (not an emulsion). BUT the highest concentration  has been 2mg/ml, so I wouldn't know how it behaves upwards of that. I would also add ethanol to prevent any contamination when in storage. The liquid composition would be 1 part ethanol/3 parts water, and the desired amount of DOC. The DOC would not precipitate or emulsify for months, so I figure it's quite soluble...

I believe Solypsis posted in the B&D DOI thread that DOB and DOI will go into solution in concentrations up to 30-35 mg/ml.  I would be surprised if DOC's solubility differed substantially.

Solipsis posted that DOB would go into solution at that rate but he said DOI would go in at 2mg/ml... which is pretty variable.


But it seems most information I've found indicated 30mg/ml is possible... not that I need it anywhere close to that... just wondering if anyone had any personal experience with pushing the max solubility of this compound.

How would anybody here compare 2C-E to DOC? I've seen a couple posts ranking DOC above the 2C-E in general. Just curious how you would compare..


Which is more visual, more mental, more easy on the body?


I've got both coming shortly, also curious if anybody has tried combining the compounds.

I have tried both of them just a few times (never combined them though). Out of the ~15 different psychedelic drugs I have tried, 2C-E and DOC are the ones that most resemble an acid trip. I think I could definitely tell the difference, but they are closer than other psychedelics.


I liked DOC better. It was easier to work with for me. But 2C-E is awesome as well. For me DOC was more visual. Actually it is the most visual of the long duration (> a few minutes) psychedelics I have tried. The body load was easier with DOC, but I think 2C-E can be deeper mentally.

Interesting, thanks. 


I found 2C-E to be VERY visual, and not overwhelmingly mental. More like random spurts of intelligence would flop outta my brain, but otherwise I was normal. 


The visual element is typically my first priority followed by the mental, so this poses well for my DOC.

I think the two are very different although you do hear both being compared to LSD quite often.


2c-e i found to be a very deep analytical psychedelic and extremly visual and after the intense peak wears off im filled with great joy/euphoria.


DOC is more "fluffy" and fun in my experience and at times can be pretty euphoric.

The visuals are beautiful but not as strong and in your face as they are with 2c-e. They are closer to the visuals i experience on acid. The body load with this one was just as bad for me as with 2c-e. Both make me very nauseas and i end up puking. 

After the puking is done though its a great trip.


remember though that YMMV.

As you can tell by reading both the 2ce thread and the DOC thread some people react to these comlpetely different than others.

Some find 2ce to be deep others find it to be not very mental. Same goes for DOC.


Either way, they are both class A psyhcedelics IMO and i think you'll enjoy trying them out.

Yeah in my experience with 2C-E, anything over 20mg had me throw up once. But yes, after that I was delightfully well. So the throwing up part doesn't really bother me all that much. 


Interesting how both get compared to Acid, but yet not so much to eachother.

LSD is such a complex psychedelic with so many different facets to it.


DOC is similar to some aspects of LSD while 2c-e is similar to others.

But i dont find them similar to each other.


LSD ftw as the most beautiful, deep, fun psychedelic ever. 


(sorry for the LSD plug, i just love it so damn much.)

For me, DOC is completely translucent on the body, no physical issues at all.  By contrast, 2C-E is the "tightest" psychedelic I have ever tried--I couldn't get comfortable in my own body, no matter what, there was just so much "ants in the pants" accompanying 2C-E.  I would (and I might have already in this thread), consider DOC second only to LSD in terms of the lack of general body load in comparison to psychedelia engendered.

^^ Nope. 


FTW is an 'engrish' acronym that means "for the win."  It is commonly used on digital communication messageboards linked together via a complex network of tubes (some might even say, a series of tubes) known colloquially as "the internet."

Then I should enjoy it. I dont get much in the way of jitters on 2c-e until I want to sleep, then I'm quite restless. Otherwise I can be comfortable enough to trip and not feel too twitchy.

**I took DOC twice about 4 years ago**


It was not a great idea, I had never had any psychedelic experience. The closest I had come was DXM. Looking back it is hard to clearly remember the details enough to write a solid TR, but I can say some things about the substance. With my current level of experience with hallucinogens I can say that DOC was very easy going, little body high, very spacey, good strong visuals. The first time I took it was a terrifying night, I had been warned about it's potency, and told to take half a blotter. I took half, waited about an hour then took the other half since I saw no efeects. About twenty minutes later it hit hard and fast, I was frightened by the whole experience, but mostly just having strange thoughts that were freaking me out( i.e. I'm hallucinating this reality and my body is outside wandering around freezing to death.) Had I not been getting stuck in these thought patterns I would have been fine.


The second time was very pleasant, I took only a half blotter, and spent the night laying in the semi-dark (I had found both full lighting and complete darkness unpleasant) in a dream-like state remembering somebody I missed and telling them everything I wished I had. It allowed me some freedom from the guilt of what i had done to this person. All in all I would be very happy to come across some again, I preferred the lack of a body high over acids static waves thing. Although acids visuals are much better, I've always had trouble with the come up on acid, DOC allows you kind of just slip into the trip without noticing you are.

I took ~1mg of DOC dissolved in alcohol and water solution the day after I tripped on acid.  I know phenethylamines and tryptames don't have a cross tolerance so I expected to at least feel a mild DOC high but, to my surprise, I did not feel anything!  Maybe it got absorbed by the food I ate right after dosing the DOC?? (I was hungry from acid tripping the previous night).  I don't understand- it was strange.


I guess I'll try again with 2mgs and no LSD the night before.

1mg of DOC is less than a threshold dose for me.  espescially with a full belly and the trip the day before.  tryptamines and phenethylamines probably do have at least a bit of cross tolerance, though definitely not as much as two different drugs from the same family.


with no tolerance, i don't reach a + or ++ with DOC much below 1.5mg.

Tryptamines and phenethylamines have cross-tolerance.  Acid is an ergotamine.  It's a common mistake to call it a tryptamine.  I think it's because it's listed in tihkal.

I have done DOC once. It was in the form of blotter, but I knew it was DOC and not LSD ahead of time. I had 2.5 squares of blotter of unknown strength. I suspect it was 1mg per square but have no other DOC experiences to compare against, so this is just a guess.


The experience was wonderful. I came up relatively fast (possibly because I held the blotter under my tongue for a long while?), and by 1.5 hours I was tripping quite hard. I experienced no nausea throughout the trip. The most prominent visual effect was that of rainbow halos around objects, especially light sources. Colors were intensified, and the world seemed very crisp. There wasn't a lot of the moving, flowing visuals that are common on LSD and the tryptamines. Mentally, I felt very clear, invigorated, positive, and affectionate. As with most phenethylamines, there is reason for comparison to MDMA, but the effects are much less pushy. Physically, I felt stimulated, but not unpleasantly so. There was a definite body tremor - in fact, this was the experience that made me really understand what that meant. This wasn't unpleasant either.


About 10 hours into the experience, the strength dropped off far enough that I felt the main phases of the DOC trip (comeup, hard-trip, lucid-trip) were over, so I took two hits of liquid acid. Needless to say, this kicked the intensity right back up there, and the combination of these two drugs produced WONDERFUL visuals. There was no increase in body load, and the two drugs seemed to wear off around the same time. This was my intention, since I am very sensitive to stimulation and it makes it impossible for me to sleep anyway. Figuring that I would be awake at least 24 hours after taking DOC anyway, I thought adding acid to the last 12 hours or so couldn't hurt.


DOC is, IMO, much, MUCH better than DOB. It feels cleaner and smoother in some way. I don't think I'd say the same of 2C-C vs. 2C-B, though. I love 2C-B, and I've never done 2C-C, but I prefer more "intense" 2C's, while the same is not necessarily true of DOx's.

I'm curious about re dosing on DO* substances after taking an initial dose. 

Is it similar to LSD were tolerance builds very quickly or can you dose far later into your trip with an increase in intensity?

Also is the come up as long when re dosing?

I took 2.5mgs this morning and my pupils are still dilated at +13 hours.  It was a fun trip though.  I find it to be quite controllable.. I was out with buddies one of whom didn't know till very later that I was even tripping.  Had loads of laughs though ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Hmm I still feel wired the next day a bit.  Not bad but I can still feel the stimulation in my backbone, like my nervous system is still operating in overtime a bit.  It's fun as I enjoy free after-glows.  

Does anyone also feel a bit cognitively enhanced the next day?  Like I still feel the a bit more lucid and able to view things from a humorous stance almost.

2.5 mg kept me up for 18 hours after which I was able to fall asleep with aid from 0.5 mg of Lorazepam.  I didn't get a deep sleep but I was asleep for 5-6 hours.

**A warning on DOC, I, & B...**


A number of years ago a I met a group of kids working "DO..".substances @ a festi. in one of the middle states selling them as "Doses". As these sort of things are often rare in these parts and their rapport in the scene was quite good they had little problems getting the better portion of kids high on this stuff. The next morning I spent several hours trying to calm kids down who were still tripping hard 12-18 hours latter. Several people including some of the band members were hospitalized as a result (not knowing what they had taken, having long hard trips, fears of death,etc.).  I personally chewed out the individuals for misrepresenting their product as "doses" asking them, "What do you think these people think they're buying?" After being warned several times by the highest levels of authority at the festival one of the elders, whom I personally know to be to be very, very cool, decided that the best course of action (considering they had been warned many many times with little concern that people were being hospitalized) would be to write a statement to the local police who then located the camp and raided not just their camp but all the adjacent camps as well. Little to nothing was found but vehicles along with personal belongings were confiscated.

![8o](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eek.gif)


~Just a warning to all of those putting this stuff on blotter & selling it as "Doses" which implies LSD. Selling this without letting the user know what it is can cause hospitalization and even death. ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)

Absolutely.  I love the DOC afterglow above most other afterglows.  The cognitive enhancement is one of the primary features of DOC to me (of all DOXs to an extent but especially DOC), and it persists into the entire afterglow.

lol that's pretty intense man. I was mainly wondering about redosing because all the DOx(mostly DOI) in my city is on tabs so the dose is hard to gauge and if you don't go high enough it can a bit of an annoying next 12-24 hours without sleep.

I recomend you to drop two tabs ( theres no chance it will be too much ),wait 4-5 hours and if its too weak drop more but be aware that it will take 10 hours to feel intense high if you redose and thats very long time,it can be hard on your mind and body becose around the time second dose will take effect you will normaly go to sleep.Be careful man,I never redosed with any DOx in my life,extrelmy long duration,stimulation and very sloooow onset... this shit is not good to redose.DOx makes your heartbeat go very fast,I think ist big stress to your heart,mdma do it too but thats 3-5 hours.

i only had an experience with DOC once. it was extremely strong and mystical. holy. total ego destruction, in a manner of speaking a "zen" state. which i was looking for on DOC. but... the drug is really cruel after hours. i am kinda person who can not sleep easily after stimulants, especially. so, i took DOC at 14:00 on saturday, the trip began about 17:00. and the peak went on for hours. so many things happened in this period, maybe in a trip report i can tell the details ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Just posted a first time TR on DOC.


Definitely underdosed this (or my lifetime phenethylamine tolerance is higher than I hoped... it had been over 2 weeks since my last go)


Overall, it was interesting for its differences from the other phens... no problems eating (actually, food was lovely), heaviness in my limbs but not my brain, very clear-headed and "awake" afterglow. 


I was trying it out as a possible addition to a vacation menu, but I don't think it will do for a long day in a foreign city. I'll probably go with 2c-p instead, that was a lot more interesting and fun for me (or acid).

Has anyone besides me blacked out on high doses? I was misinformed about how much was on a blotter paper that I thought was lsd and it was doc and I dosed +10mg. I blacked out and ran around speaking gibberish and screaming random words while seizing. Yet the whole time I was doing this I had no idea I was even me. I basically entered this very intense trip with hyperdimensional beings that looked sort of like the suits in a scanner darkly ( i hadn't seen this film at the time ). If you have please message me I'd love to talk about your experience.

Actually yes... I've blacked out on all kinds of substances, including DOC, DOM, 2C-E, mushrooms, 4-HO-DMT and 4-AcO-DMT.  I find that extremely powerful psychedelics can cause a temporary black-out if the peak effects become too strong.  It seems to me that the ego-dissolving effects become so dissolving that the ego is temporary completely suppressed, leaving you with no memory of the event.  Ordinarily with strong ego dissolving pscyhedelics, your ego is diminished/dissolved significantly, but there is some part left there so that "you" the human can experience and remember the trip.


I have not, however, ever ended up running around screaming or speaking gibberish or anything like that... I've ended up slumped in my chair or bed or something and come to in the same place.

It will still last nearly as long... a lot longer than half the duration.  But if 3mg lasted 29 hours for you, 1.5 would likely last maybe 22 to 24.  So still very long.


Personally I always LOVE the aftereffects of DOC... to me, the plateau stage (after the peak, starting around hour 10) is a state of grace.  I wish I could feel that way forever.  Everything feels easy and positive and energetic and good, and my mind feels lubricated and brilliant.  I used to use DOC quite a bit and I got lots of good work done during those states... I'd use DOC about 10-12 hours before I was going to go into a significant social situation and be the life of the party.  Great stuff... DOC is possibly my favorite drug of all.

The reason for your discrepancies in experiences is because DOB is the most physically intense and taxing of the DOXs.  I find DOB to be hard on the body and heart, whereas DOC is smooth and light and actually makes me feel relaxed physically, though paradoxically I have plenty of energy.  DOC feels very at-home in my body (after a sometimes uncomfotrable come-up - though also sometimes not), but DOB feels unwanted by my body.


Of course we're all affected differently but I think more people tend to find DOC much cleaner and gentler on the body than DOB.


Also, DOB lasts longer than DOC and takes longer to develop... I get a good strong trip going after 2 hours on DOC, though the peak really lasts from about 3-8 hours, and starts dropping off by 10.  DOB doesn't really swing up until maybe 4 for me and then doesn't peak until around 6... and the peak lasts maybe from 6-12 hours.  So they have different timeframes.

Would this be comparable to the great body feel one gets with 2c-c?  I hadn't tried 2c-c because I wasn't a huge fan of 2c-i or 2c-b, but DOC has had my interest for a while now, and not being able to get ahold of any DOC, I opted for the phenethylamine counterpart.  Its easily my favorite halogenated 2c.

I love DOC... probably in my top 5. I especially love the afterglow it leaves me in the following day, but I'm sure I've mentioned this elsewhere in this thread already ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)


Used to have a wonderful stash of this compound but it got flushed a couple years ago... long story. Makes me want to cry everytime I think about it.


Anyways, I did managed to hold onto 9mg of DOC but it is dissolved in everclear (not sure if was 151 or 190 proof atm) and has been stored in an airtight vial that has been kept in the dark at room temperature for about 3 years.


I know these compounds are very stable and degrade very slowly but I'm not sure about long term stability in such a solution. Any thoughts or personal experiences? Would it be ok to continue to store in this way... it could very well be several more years before I ever get around to using it.

I actually actively dislike 2C-C; I can't put my finger on why, but I don't care for it.


There is definitely not a 1:1 correspondence between the alpha-methylated and non-alpha methylated psychedelic phens. I hate DOB, but like 2CB; I like 2C-D a great deal, but am indifferent on DOM

I found the effects didn't get all that interesting until >40mg, with 60 being really cool, but unfortunately the highest dosage i've tried.

Almost definitely a purely recreational substance, but recreation has its place.  I suppose i could see it aiding in meditation or some other spiritual practice as its very user directed.  Also it lacks the time dilating effect that make other 2c's a poor choice for attempting things like yoga or meditation.

I'm going to say one thing in this vein... never thought I'd say this but here it is and you can quote me:


"DOC is everything LSD was trying to be but failed miserably in achieving."


Yeah.  That's right.  

And I'm not being facetious.

That's great to hear. I'll be trying mine as soon as I find a spare 12-24 hours. Maybe in a couple of weeks ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


And just as an aside, this DOC HCl (?) is not very soluble in ethanol. I couldn't find any information on this, so I tried it, and it only dissolved once I added some water to the ethanol. Even heating up the EtOH didn't help significantly.

The verdict is not final. Apparently there is already one positive report, and some more reliable analysis results are coming. The news is circulating in ADD...

Hm. Why would it not dissolve in ethanol though? Pure DOC should dissolve in  straight ethanol, right? Seems to me its either not DOC at all, or a very impure, bad synth. ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)

if you take a look at the [thread in ADD](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/showthread.php?t=532933), 2 people referred that amphetamine (and DOC is an amphetamine) salts dissolve poorly in ethanol, but quite well when there is water in it. Also someone referred that hydrochloric salts dissolved well in everclear so we can assume that perhaps amphetamine HCl salts do dissolve in ethanol. BUT there are other salts that may have lower solubility points. Also from the published synthesis reports the hydrochloric salt is reportedly moderately soluble in ethanol/ether but insoluble in acetone (all polar solvents). So, I have not yet lost hope that it is indeed DOC!![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif)

There seems to be some conflicting opinion on the matter. I cant find any conclusive data on whether DOC is soluble in ethanol or not. Some of the older reports indicate that it should dissolve readily in ethanol. 

In any case, I guess we will know soon enough if this stuff is legit or not.

Damnit, it says in PiHKAL that he recrystallizes from acetone/EtOH. Of course it's not readily soluble in ethanol. I should have done my research first ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)


I'm going to see if I can't get a melting point for this sample with the help of a friend of a friend with a mp apparatus. That could at least confirm that it's not DOC, if it is indeed something else.

My DOC was real. 2mg on white blotter yielding a brownish tint and a chemical taste.  Lasted 23 hours (potentiated with Piracetam) until I knocked myself out with 1mg Xanax.  Euphoric, energetic, stable-minded, epiphanic, and visual with amazing CEVs.


Also, I wouldn't trust the DOC that was just synthesized.  More will be synthesized and available in mid-November and it will be real.

It didn't appear to dissolve in everclear. It readily dissolved once I added enough water to make it maybe a 50-70% alcohol solution, though.

The DOC I had for years I received years ago, and it was amazing.  DOC is the holy grail of psychedelics to me.  I only wish that I had any money at all right now.

Found this report on another forum:


> Dosage 7.5 mg: After an hour things are beginning to happen. My previous days experiment was with 3mg which gave some effect but less than expected. The 3 hour point things have become strong now. Trees and other objects are wavering and moving. Tracers got large at this point. A bird flew by leaving a tracer about 10 feet long that looked like a tube with wings flapping out of the sides in several locations along the way. Marijuana gives some spike to the experience. The snow coming down all leaves sparkling little tracers. There is a general good feeling all around. Things proceeded like this for most of about 12 hours overall and then mostly tapered off. Some things were a little weird about this. It seemes like DOC for sure but the water solubility ratio was all wrong for what I am used to. Perhaps I was high and/or excited and had accidentally used colder water than I had intended to. Perhaps the product is slightly impure/not DOC. It did give stange reagant results to be sure. Either way it was a pleasurable experience. Very clean burn no noise, no discomfort, no nausea. Just like DOC usually is.

Seems to me there might be some issues with purity, as was initially suspected. 3mg should give full effects - 7.5mg seems excessive - though tolerance from the previous day has to be taken into account here. Also the solubility issue mentioned, points towards this being a impure batch. Hm.

DOC as I mentioned is my favorite drug, psychedelic or otherwise.  The batches I had in the past all dissolved extremely readily into both water and alcohol (I had 3 batches, 2 in water/alc mixtures and one highly concentrated in 99% pure ethanol).  The poor ethanol solubility worries me.  I was bumming that I can't afford at this point to restock on the compound that has so many valuable uses for me, particularly in my writing.  But I think it's probably good that I wasn't able to or I would have jumped in without waiting and would now have a product I was unsure about ingesting.  


I have faith that real, pure DOC will be available again.  Why it hasn't been for so long, I have no idea.  A lot of people love it.  Hell, DOM was far more available for quite some time than DOC and it's been schedule 1 for decades.  But none of the DOXs in my experience really truly compare to DOC.

I guess we will know for sure when more user reports surface. I was really looking forward to this one. Too bad the dox chems are so hard to find. I would love to try out DOM as well. Two top tier psyches right there.

So ... I got a melting point for this DOC sample I received recently. It was actually high, over 205C, which really surprised me, as impure drugs should generally melt at a slightly lower temperature than pure drugs. That could either mean that it's really pure and the mp apparatus was miscalibrated, or it is very impure. I checked the acetone solubility, and it was indeed soluble in acetone, as Shulgin had noted. However, when I tried it at 1.6mg, I got no effects.


It turns out, it's just impure. I got an email from the vendor today stating that it is active around 8mg. Oh well.


I do wonder, though, what could the impurity be? It can't be 2,5-DMA, as that melts well below where DOC melts. I guess from a harm-reduction standpoint, I should just throw this stuff out?

Bad synth as suspected then. ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)

If you need 8mg for any significant activity to occur, it cant be more than 20-30% pure? Hopefully there will be another, legit batch - I didnt realize these chinese synth 'companies' were that sloppy. ![:|](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eyesclosed.gif)

Some of the purity of RCs being claimed at 98 or 99% pure have been pathetic.

eh i don't think they should be boycotted.  they just need better resources.  they obviously don't have the correct equipment to analyze their products themselves.  perhaps they need to budget better so that they can afford to have a third party analyze their products before they sell them to the masses.  this was definitely a mistake on their part, but not an unforgivable one.

A simple Marquis test would show that is not DOC, do not think it's getting expensive equipment ...

I definitely think its worthwhile, some people here rate it among the best of the best. Of course ymmv. Too bad this synth was botched, apparently other dox compunds were in the pipeline as well, but now postponed because of this. ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)

touche sir.


further down this line of thinking:  they showed a photo containing many different reagent test results that were produced by their "DOC."  the marquis reaction was brown.  a quick google search says that real DOC is supposed to turn dark green.  what the fuck were those 30 people doing buying the stuff anyway?

this is just my opinion (of course), but i wasn't all that impressed when i did it. my body actually felt very at ease after the come-up, which was nice, but otherwise it was lackluster. 


i felt spaced out and almost stupefied more than turned on or tripped out. usually when tripping i'll have a very active mind, lots of wild or lively thoughts, profound feelings, etc. but no. just spaced out. i wasn't even able to really make witty banter with my friends who were also on it, which for most other psychedelics is the dullest case scenario. on the plus side, this did make it very non-threatening.


the visuals also weren't bad, but not great for a DO*. DOM's are more colorful (though my body generally feels worse), and DOM is much more insightful too.


the other psychedelics (beside DOC & M) i have tried include: LSD, mushrooms, DMT, 4-aco-dmt, 5-meo-mipt, 2c-e, 2c-p, 2c-b, 2c-i, 2c-t-7 & mescaline. though DOC would be good specifically for just taking a high dose and comfortably spacing out with the visuals, overall i liked every other psych. i've done more.

Lol, probably. But will these reports be "DOC reports"? 

AFAIR, that source already stocked inactive DOC. And in addition, we saw multiple unsuccessful attempts at DOC synthesis by various reasons.


I would take all new information with a grain of salt.

I'm confident I could tell if it is DOC or something else from prior experience. I also think you must mean a different source than the one I'm thinking of, I have never heard of them stocking inactive DOC.


Hopefully labs have learned from previous mistakes and produced DOC this time. I would imagine vendors would be more wary than usual and be very sure that what they have is DOC. Nobody seemed to have a problem producing it a few years ago.

I should be able to get some DOC in fews weeks ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


By the way i had some questions :


1) Do you think it is possible to make a liquid solution using Distilled Water and alcohol ?

2) I'm total noob in math do you think it is possible to make something like 1mg for 0.1ml ? So that's mean 10mg will be 1ml ? Can it be dissolved ?

3) I only tried DOI several times, how did you compare to it in terms of visuals ?


Thank you !

Yes! It is easily soluble in water and alcohol. I still have a little bit of pre-2006 DOC dissolved in vodka.

10mg/ml is a little strong. I would be inclined to go for 1-2mg/ml, safer to dose imho.

Sorry, can't help you with that one, never tried DOI. 

DOC is *very* visual though.

**Not your Grandma's Psyche**


^ This is the biggest concern.


People not knowing what to expect, and not planning on 23 hours of proper setting.


It's a shame, I feel that this round of DOC will be a harbinger of doom for the scene, for this very reason.


Some asshole is going to rail up like 50 mg and then it's Blaine Part Deux.


**I mean, it's almost as if the novelty is making people want to try it, rather than the reported effects!!**


How often would someone really want to trip with an amphet push for over 16-18 or more hours?


I am sure that some small sample of good DOC will finally find it's way to me, but despite having some fair amount of experience, I cannot even begin to imagine when I would find time to properly research it! Each incremental upward tick in dose takes like a day and a half to fully characterize.


All we can really hope for is that 1) No one misrepresents the material as something else (although, hopefully word is hitting the Lucy-Lovers that misrepresented DOC blotters might be headed their way); 2) Everyone who gets it does the proper amount of research before allergy testing and then starting up small with a trip sitter and benzos on hand...


...So, yeah, we're screwed, because there is no way this perfect scenario will play out in the real world.


The history of the 60's features the horrific story of DOM's introduction to the Scene quite prominently, will future tales be told of the DOC 2011 trips? Let's hope not.

I honestly think you're being melodramatic/exaggerating. DOC has been on the scene for quite awhile and we haven't seen anything remotely like this. DOM's fiasco introduction was somewhat unique, anyway.

Not at all. DOC has been around a good while now, and nobody has had any trouble. I wouldn't be so hasty as to extrapolate from one isolated incident of reckless and irresponsible behaviour - involving a different compound - that the rest of the psychedelic chemical scene is "screwed". 


I'm very much looking forward to this new batch of DOC. It's just perfect timing as well, since the weather is getting sunny and gorgeous. I feel pumped for summer. ![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif)

Just seems like maybe "the scene" has somehow devolved or something.


The NBOMes weren't prone to cause tragedy because of the of the impossibility of oral dosage, so they aren't too worrying. 


The DOXs are becoming quite available for the first time in a while and for some reason I sense doom now.


Hopefully I'm wrong. Just please explore safely everyone!

This does sound like an interesting compound, maybe a festival sorta trip, once famaliarity has been established.


Obviously, chems that are active in such small doses do pose greater risk of foolish overdose so I kinda understand the paranoia of the more experienced BLer's.


Everyone be safe with powerful NBOM'es & DOxx type compounds, lets be careful out there!

Thanks for your impressive answer ! Yeah seriously don't fuck with DOx cause they are really long lasting. I like DOx (DOI was the 1st i tried) and really OMG beware because it last long and if you having a bad trip good luck ! Be carefull when dosage and use liquid measurement aswell ! Don't fuck please don't fuck with this compound. Don't triy any DOx for the first time ! Go for something more forgiven than these chemicals.

I agree with HofmannBlotter, stuck in 24h trip would suck mayor balls ,and you may get depression/anxiety for quite some time from this experience. 


I am going to order that DOC (1000mg) and share it among experienced psychedelic users. 

But first of all I am going to test the shit out of it. I never give out compounds that I don't know what it does to you.

Trips are easily able to become physically rigorous as well as mentally and emotionally. Most people won't want to trip every week simply because of the duration. You're practically devoting an entire day (12-18 hours) to tripping your balls off.

Don't worry, tripping every week like that would get sick. It's just nice to have supply (trip everytime I want to). 


Also, is 3mg good starting dose for experienced? I am experienced with loads of 2c-x,lsd, and many other chems that aren't psychedelics.

Thanks dude. I have read it all, and I have been studying DOC before extensively, but am still skeptical. I am skeptical because there is a lot of negativity around it, but big percent that negative reports come from stupidity. 

So, does this means I should still be skepticals if idiots manage to dose 10mg+?


I am not planning nor have balls to dose 10mg ever. The most I might ever dose is 3mg. For beginning I will dose 1.5mg, I really doubt it will be able to turn into terror experience, especially on nice sunny day :D.


We are always planning if we are going to trip. Period. We don't want bullshit when we are tripping ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png). 


bullshit = cops, anti-drug people, people we hate, etc...


Also, you said DOC should be handled as LSD... as in terms of potency or in terms of effects? 


I think you should just keep it simple, and say : Set & Setting


No bad thoughts in your head &

Good place without bullshit for 24h, and one day after for rest.


Saying that you will get your ass kicked because you want to use DOC recreationally is... absurd ![:|](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eyesclosed.gif) . If dose is ok, set is ok, setting is ok, why should I get my ass kicked?


(all I spoke up there is for users that already have at least some experience with psyches)


Also no-one should fear something they take, because that can have negative effect on trip. But as you said, handle with care and respect, absolutely!


Now another question, does DOC trip really consists of two parts, first one : intensive mindfuck, and second one : extreme lucidity / peace?

Let me repeat DOC ***has been on the scene at various points for years.*** 


These prices are not dramatically different. Most people who know nothing about DOC/are not experienced won't even think to buy it or look for it. I would understand your concern if this were some great new precedent, but it's not. I just don't see the huge worry. 


I support posts like forbidden's because they are informative and can only minimize harm. However, posts like reformer's - let's not freakin fear monger here. that's useless and melodramatic

I know that one of the main goal of BL is harm reduction.

But harm reduction shouldn't be fun reduction. 


Why start with 0.5 mg? I've rechecked PiHKAL and it states dosage range as 1.5 - 3.0 mg. Why not start with 1.5 mg and prepare yourself for possibly powerful experience(actually, you don't know how powerful is any psychedelic for you, until you tried it).

DOI has been available again for an even lower price for about 6 months now. 


I do take your point though.  The demographic of people likely to get their hands on this has changed somewhat since it was last available. There seems to be a lot of kids taking silly doses of things like 2c-e and of course the bathsalt/MDPV thing has bred a culture of irresponsibility. That, coupled with the hype surrounding DOC could lead to incidents but I don't think we need to panic just yet.


And yes, take .5mg (or less) for your first time as an allergy test if nothing else (you should be doing this with any new compound anyway). TBH, I find it doesn't get very interesting until 2mg+, .5mg would barely be threshold, but be careful!

Not a toy, no. But if taken in the proper context, DOx compounds can be lots of fun.

Quite difficult for some people. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) Psychedelic experience is not only about dose, but also about right set and setting. I have a sample of DOI, which I haven't touched for 2 months already, despite I really would like to try it. 

So thank you, I would stay within dose range recommended by Shulgin.

**I** don't know. I haven't tried it yet.

And I am pretty sure that most people who will try DOC in the near future have some experience with powerful psychedelics, and not just 2C-I and weed. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

Many people are going to try DOC have experience with 2C-E, which isn't toy too. Or is it for you?


I am not against harm reduction, but this is really too much harm reduction.

True, I was like this ![8o](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eek.gif) when I saw DOC prices.

Well, if my man gets this in as he plans I may have the opportunity to sample this rare compound. I can assure you Mr Fruit that I am an intelligent, grown-up kid, that I have been researching this compound & it's relatives for more than 10 years & I've read every word you've said in this thread. I have taken it to heart. I consider myself highly experienced but am extremely wary of such a powerful substance & should I get hold of 10mgs I'm reducing my starting dose from 1.25mg to .75mg & as my lady friend is new to this sorta thing, she's getting the .5mg dose you advise.


Thanks for taking the time to share your experiences. Unlike some, I'm not offended by your efforts to warn off the foolhardy! In fact, good job!

@forbiddenisdefruit: Get a hold of yourself mate, for goodness sake. Every single drug known to man (pretty much) has a level of toxicity past which you'll damage yourself or die, if you are physically able to consume a such a dose. You may as well go on a rant about any drug with which you can easily consume a toxic dose.


Who are you to tell people they should only use 1.5-2mg, once a week at the most. Who are you to tell people what doseages they should start taking. Most people will want to dose far higher than 0.5mgs, who are you to tell them otherwise. 


It's ridiculous and unfair to say that most DOC users are going to be ill-read "kids". The demographic of people you are talking about - those uneducated beyond coke, smack, and crack - will most likely never see DOC, and if they do, it will probably be in small amounts in single hits where it is explained to them exactly what it is. It's nobody's business to decide who is responsible enough to take drugs. Once again, DOC has been around for years, you're a little late on jumping down it's throat. The party has been going on for ages and everyone's doing just fine.


Give your fellow human beings the benefit of the doubt and respect their ability to judge for themselves, rather than insulting everyone's intelligence. I'm not going to sit on a DOx compound for months just to try to prove to myself or anyone else that I have the respect and that I'm worthy to partake of it. 


And about the price; it is simply a principle in the psychedelic drug scene that no compound should be available only to those who have cash flowing out of their areshole. I don't see how that makes it any more likely to fall in to the hands of "kids".


Elitist and alarmist nonsense. ![:|](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eyesclosed.gif)

forbiddenisdefruit, just becasue you had a bad time on DOI doesn't mean everyone else will have a bad time on DOC or DOI. Your posts are extremely biased towards tarnishing the image of a perfectly good psychedelic drug. I have used DOC before and it is nothing like what you make it out to be. 


If you had a nightmare with DOI, it was because you couldn't handle that particular experience. Not because nobody else can handle it. If you have demons inside your skull, that does not translate to everyone else having a bad time. On the contrary, DOC is a beautiful trip; long-lasting, yes, but something wonderful that - in my experience - I didn't want to come down from. Quite different from the gruelling 24 hours you make it out to be.


There's no need to insult everyone by telling them they can't make sensible decisions by themselves. Most people will do an allergy test on any substance they take. After that, it's up to them to decide an optimum dose to start with, and most people find PiHKAL and TiHKAL, along with erowid, very helpful in this regard.

I feel like no one takes the time to do their own research anymore...the check one wiki article and think they know the drugs they are taking...or they come here and read one thread assuming that it's valid enough information to base their life choices on. When I first started using drugs I would spend hours just learning about them and what other people had to say about them. Granted I didn't have any sources back then...but even if I would have I might have still been as inclined to do research. Now days kids are getting ahold of sources without even really educating themselves on the products...they hear that it makes you trip and they assume it's like fuckin robitussin or something.

They are only about 8-10 times as potent (based on a 200 microgram dose of acid versus a 2 milligram dose of DOx) and they should be equally feared and respected. This is unlike any 2C-x compound you've ever done and the only one comes close to comparing in potency is 2C-P. Don't even think about comparing it to a tryptamine experience...the duration differential alone blows that idea to hell.

And finally, stop being so serious about it. DOC is fun and beautiful, not fearful and frightening. I'm not trying to be blasé or intentionally nonchalant. However, these things are meant to be fun as well as being powerful tools. They are not meant to be feared in the way you are planting the seeds of inception.


I'm not so complacent as to think that bad experiences with drugs will never happen to me again. I've had enough 'rude awakenings' myself to know this. However, obsessing about potentially negative outcomes and crawling under your bed in fear only sets you up for a miserable time. Imposing nanny-level protection over others doesn't make it any better either.

"Who are you to tell people what dosages they should start taking."


Dosage is one of the main topics of discussion on this board. Plenty of people share their opinions of good starting dosages of chemicals here.


The bottom line is that substances that are very potent pose a greater risk of improper measurement. 


This definitely does not mean that the DOXs are bad, just a bit more problematic.


Hopefully this one will respected and enjoyed greatly.

These drugs should be respected, but I don't believe they should be feared. I'm glad they are becoming available again. I'll definitely be picking some up (probably about a quarter gram) and will be using liquid measurement and definitely starting lower (even after conversion) than I have with the 2Cs. It'll might be annoying having a below threshold experience on something like .5 mg, but it seems better than overdoing it the first time.

^^^ To a point, but never underestimate the prevalence of idiocy in the human kind. The last time DOC was in *wider* circulation in 2006 or 7 or whenever there were  quite a few dumb ass stories in newspapers around the USA about DOC,freak outs, and the police. I saw it being referred to as "super molly" in a few of the articles (?!) and being described as "a powerful mix of amphetamine and   psychedelics". Yup, idiocy....


Bluelight is a harm reduction forum and DOC is an order of magnitude touchier and far less forgiving than its more common 2C brethren.  I don't think it is possible to lay it on too thick in regards to safety, dosage, and what to expect. Is it going to more unpleasant to sift through a few pages of cautionary advice or a 24 hr trip?


Be safe!

You really think that is a good idea?


You freak out on 4-ho-met because of the bodyload - but want to trip on DOC?


If you do it, please be carefull! i remember reading a thread dedicated to you in the shrine... glad you're still alive - please make it last a little longer?


and really - 10mg/ml with something like DOC - that's way too high of a concentration, much too easy to overdose that way... better to do 1mg/10ml!


please be carefull! ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

LoL... My post **must** have been bad. For all the melodrama here I got singled as the one with the "worthless" post. Nevermind that I was able to confirm purity by having seen the HNMR and LCMS, which is always beneficial in terms of harm reduction, in my book.


Well, anyways, to make amends, I have a question/suggestion about aborting DOC- DOC lasts a long time yes, so we need a solution that won't wear off before the DOC is done having its way with a person.


Phenazepam- that abhorred, non euphoric, 60+ hour half-life monstrosity of a benzo. Is that the solution here for a negative DOC experience? A premeasured bit of the Phenazepam, sitting around just in case?


In essence, is it more desirable to utilize a long lasting, non-emotional  benzo like phenazepam with DOX than a shorter acting, emotionally disruptive one like etizolam (I find etizolam to sometimes give a weird, manic euphoria for a period)?

^ It sounds really strange that Phenazepam has 60 hours half-life, its instruction states that T1/2 = 6-10-18 hours. 


Also, is atypical antipsychotics(like Zyprexa) an option for you?

I haven't read the originating publication myself, but, as you prolly already saw, this is the paper that wikipedia references:


**ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7173273


Eur J Drug Metab Pharmacokinet. 1982;7(3):191-6.


Species differences in phenazepam kinetics and metabolism.**


Anecdotally, I've heard it takes a long time to come on. I have some, but have had no cause to try it yet. The long come-on of the Phenazepam might make it less than optimal to trip-abort in a timely fashion.

Hmmm... Don't know. Not familiar with them, actually. I have always been fearful of the whole Tardive Diskinesia thing, as I know some people who are on anti-psychotics long term (I don't know if they're "atypical" or not), and they have serious tremor issues.


Now, I would guess though, that this concern about Tardive Diskinesia is irrelevant to "once in a blue-moon" anti-psychotic usage with the sole intent to trip-abort? 


Also, I think that in general I would prefer to "abort" with a benzo, as benzos+entheogens are my guilty pleasure: I know I'll probably take flak here, but I sometimes like the benzo+2C-X or Trypt combination for it's relaxed, integrative and just plain fun aspects. So, the headspace and familiarity of benzo aborts are probably more friendly to me than experimenting with anti-psychotics.


Thanks for the tip though, I will be checking into these. Maybe they're for trips that reasonable amounts of benzos just won't touch?

Unfortunately, diazepam is Schedule IV in my country... So that kind of makes it difficult, and not worth the risk to acquire. I already have the Phenazepam, so although my country has disallowed further imports, it's still technically legal. I also have access to Etizolam, which might be considered an "analogue", but analogue laws apply only to schedule I compounds here, so that is technically legal as well.


I'd like to stay as legit as possible, and valium is not the answer in that regard unfortunately.

Yeah, I saw this in wikipedia, although I read abstract only now.

It seems quite strange to me, because, like I said, russian instruction states T1/2 is only 6-10-18 hours. Is T1/2. Anecdotally, I tend to agree with the instruction, rather then with this article. 


> Anecdotally, I've heard it takes a long time to come on.

This depends on what you call "long time". Is 1hours long for you?

I think I usually start feeling its efffects after 20-30 minutes, with full effects after another 30 minutes.

Benzos probably have less side-effects than antipsychotics, but I just wanted to suggest another option.

etizolam might be a better option IMO.  0.5mg sublingually makes me extremely relaxed quite quickly.  If i have any drinks at all i'll probably doze off on the couch.  Also mirtazepine, a 5-HT2a antagonist, works for some without some of the negative aspects of anti-psychotics.

^ Pretty much exactly why I'm watching this thread. Peeps are probebly waiting for just the right time to try this compound...


I alos find Etiz a good downer because it comes on so quickly. I'm not sure it would last long enough to cancel out a bad DOC trip but one could always dose again (once) if uncomfortable on DOC. Personally, I'd probably go for Valium at a nice high (for me) dose of 10 or 20mg but would have to be prepared for the hour long approach. Etiz would def hit quicker. But who knows how these thing might interact! The best option if to find the right time, set & setting for this sorta trip & reduce as much as possible the chances of an unpleasant trip.


Thanks again to Fruity for his warnings & for qualifying his earlier, more incendary posts! I'm still starting below the 1mg dosage (IF I can get some DOC) & working up slowly on different days. I'd advise anyone new to these things to do the same & familiarise yourselves with the effects of DOC slowly. It's just common sense with anything new!


Finally, I recomend highly diluting this compound so as to make allergy testing easier. My plan is to add 10mgs of DOC (IF etc etc) to 200 drops of Vodka, making each drop contain 50ug of DOC. I expect & hope that 50ug is WELL below the active dose & will have zero effect but if I'm sensitive in any way hopefully reactions will not be fatal at this extremely low dosage. Allergy testing this compound might be quite difficult so if anyone else has any idea's how to do so safely, I'm all ears...

50 'drops' is not an acccurate volume of liquid. Dilute using a known volume of vodka.

in regards to allergy testing, get a metered oral dropper.  For $3-4 my local pharmacy has packs of 2 that are tickered every 0.25mL, dilute ~10mg in 20mL of your favorite distilled water/EtOH mixture, suck up .25mL, and ingest.  125µg should be plenty small for an allergy test.  If that's not low enough for you, just dilute the initial mixture more, the math's pretty easy ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


And racemate eh?  I was a bit curious as to if it were going to be enantiopure.  Oh well...

With the trouble they had getting a good synth of racemic DOC to materialize, I'm not suprised they didn't opt for an asymmetric synthesis. Can you imagine the hassle :D

Just made a 2mg/ml solution with vodka. It dissolved almost instantly, more soluble than I remember. If you're not experienced with the compound I would recommend a weaker solution. Will probably assay some day this week if all goes well.

It's pretty much just about the potency with these drugs. In relation to the psychedelic amphetamines: "Rat studies, where there is a measure of the discrimination of a test compound from saline, have shown the "R" isomer to have about twice the potency of the "S" isomer."

A quasi-legal substance reputed to be almost identical to LSD by many users, with a longer duration? For those of us who aren't well connected to LSD sources (it is remarkably hard to come by in some cities.. like my own, often) it sounds like a godsend.

I agree, I've done DOC and don't find it EXTREMELY similar - I think there is a similarity though in that they're both very psychedelic and VERY light on the body. DOC and LSD are two of the only psychedelics I can take without getting nauseous!

DOC is nothing like LSD. If it is like LSD than all 5HTergics are "like LSD".

i think i took 2.5mg.  i had done pretty high doses of 2c-t-21 and i had taken 5g of shrooms twice (as well as maybe 5 smaller shroom trips), so i thought i could jump into DOC at 2.5mg.  =p  i should have started at 1.5mg, maybe 2mg at the most.

Good to know.  I'm definitely going to start small with DOC.  With it being so long, having an overwhelming trip will not be fun.

Two previous pages are totally about responsibility of using this substance, so let's talk about something else, maybe? ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Also, recent discussion was about purity and availabilty of DOC, although it went to a specific vendor discussion a couple of posts ago.

I too ordered a sample and am not sure if it got sent or not... very strange.


I could maybe find a saved NMR pic from that site... gah with their weird closing statement and all I'm really curious as to whats up? Gotta make sure my paranoia doesnt get the better of me :O

~12 mg 


I find that the difficult experiences and trainwrecks reports on erowid usually have the unusually high doses.

I've tried up to 11mg and 6-8mg too many times to count. At this level you really need somebody to watch over you, make sure you're hydated and stay in a safe place etc. At 11mg the visuals were so powerful that I couldn't tell if my eyes were open or closed.

I wouldn't take a dose like that again!

The very strong peak is over after 8-10hrs. After that it's just a gradual fading of effects. I find that sleep comes easily after the peak.

Everyone who is involved in this "vendor talk" in this thread will have already read about and for the most part understood the issues you have just raised through those sources. Anyone who isn't able to absorb that type of info elsewhere isn't going to on BL's big and dandy thread. but, whatevs it's probably not a huge deal; it's just that the megathreads in PD have always essentially functioned as a giant amalgam of information related to the drug in general, not specific discussions of various sources... etc

IamMe, not to blatantly ignore your post or anything, I just feel this next blurb of info is important for these particular 'purple powderers' to know. 


An *snip* assay was submitted saying it took 5 hours to take effect and that peak was felt at 12 hours, and they reported this was via an 'unconventional MOA'. Transdermal? Just a little strange...

Enough with the vendor discussion, it ends right now. Unless you have invaluable information that will save lives or reduce a lot of harm, stop hinting towards anything that has to do with sources. We just don't allow it.

Right! Someone had to take the bull by the horns, may as well be me & my bitch, Mrs T.


As I planned I mixed 10mg that I got off my man (he musta got loads coz he GAVE it to me to test) with 200 drops of Vodka, making 50ug per drop. Allergy tests were done on 3 seperate mornings over the week at 50ug, 150ug & 250ug with no obvious effects. Possible minor, subtle phet like stimulation at the 250ug but I took as placebo.


1pm today 1.25mg each, we are both light in weight & both of us seem sensitive to stimulants & psychedelics, so this dose seemed pretty conservative.


2pm first alerts, slight light head. No nausea, no problem drinking a milkshake at this time. In fact, given how warm it was today, it was heaven.


3pm Definite full activity. But it's not in your face as this dose. I say by the evening we were confident we could take a higher dose next time. Having said that, it's now midnight & although we're both tired I wouldnt say the effects have fully worn off. They are definitely on the slide though, & it's been a GREAT day. The experience has been overwhelmingly positive, funny & pleasantly trippy. I'd say this was a comfortable 'museum dose', definitely a +2, flirting with a +3 occassionally, especially walking in the park, in the dark lol


The bodybuzz & energy felt good, there was no uncomfortable, forced 'push'. We both felt good physically, & enjoyed ALOT of excercise today.


Hope this helps anyone planning to assay this & waiting for someone to guinea-pig it. It's superb but does have long legs, you should go easy & take your time finding your sweet spot. You wouldnt wanna get stuck in THIS long if you werent thoroughly enjoying it. But speaking for myself & my bitch, Mrs T, we definitely enjoyed it. Superb, SUPERB material! ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

Well, I've just seen a NON-Vendor, NON-Source, independent LC-MS of most recent DOC (purple) that a member contracted and posted at another site and it looks beautiful. PM me if you can't find it.

Will be trying my first higher-than-allergy-test dose of the DOC this weekend (the white batch). What has yall's experience been with low doses of DOC? 


I was thinking 300-500ug (i recognize that that won't produce a full trip experience; i'm thinking when i do take a proper dose, assuming this trial doesn't indicate that the chemical doesn't agree with me, i'd shoot for 1-2mg)


Has anyone used low dose DOC in combination with other psychedelics? If so, how did it work out?

See above, my test a 250ug produced NO obvious effects. But apart from weed, we didnt mix with anything else active. This stuff does curve so 500ug might work better than 250ug, but the afects at 250 were almost non-existant & could well have been placebo effec.


But worth goin easy, you an always add another 250ug once any efects have been established.


We aborted last nght a 4am coz we sill felt a little energised using only 5mg of valium. Woke up at 10:30am with an invite from Mrs T Bitches folks who want to meet for breakfast EEEEHHH! So we bolted outta bed &, honestly, I feel damn close to 100% fine. Slight weakness & hangover, but very very subtle, be fine once Ive had more than 6 hours kip.


Incidentally, we ate fine on the come-up, ate more than once on the trip. So no anorexea at the 1.25mg dose.


Our compound, for your info is a white crystal.


Oh, also EDIT! I think my bitch tripped a little harder yesterday than I did & I'm thinking this migh be due to my incremental allergy testing in the week. I had upped my tolerence with the allergy testing, methinks.

1.75mg of my new purple-tinted DOC was taken and led to an AMAZING time rock-climbing along the Pacific NW coastline. Come up took 3 hours, peak for a good 6, come down for around 8ish. And no shitty side effects.

Sweet! 


So I have a sample of DOC and although I have a 0.0001 g Analytical Balance I'm not really trying to use it to measure out specific sub milligram doses.  I would prefer to use the liquid measuring technique and have a 0.1 mL oral syringe for that.


Since I don't want to keep the DOC in liquid my thought was to just make a handful of 0.5 mg doses on some form of edible. So now to the questions.


1) Is a 0.5 mg resolution alright? I realize if I have to I can dissolve the candy and split that for a better resolution. 

2) Will the DOC be stable on the edible? Storage conditions are in some sort of container in a dark place. 

3) Is any particular solute more suitable for this job? My thought was IPA as it isn't toxic at the <1 mL level and it evaporates quickly. 

4) For the edibles, are sugar cubes or sweet tarts better? Or is there something super secret that works the best. 


Ermm. Anything else anybody wants to add just let me know.


EDIT: I'm not planning on just taking a single 0.5 mg dose. It would be two or three.

DOC, like other phenethylamines and amphetamines, is rock solid stable, and will out-live you unless you store it really recklessly. Liquid is fine for it.


And, at 500ug, it was clearly active, but definitely not enough for even a mild trip. Next time will probably go for 1.2-1.6mg.

Yeah, I suspected you'd feel 500ug but to get things going abit I'd advise greater than 1mg for your next try. I have very low tolerance & weight nothing & 1.25 was fine for me. Proper, gentle, LONG trippings. Nice! Go up slowly though, I suspect the curve is significant with this stuff!


So it's safe to store in the usual way ie out of light & away from warmth & damp, yes? Is it safe to store as a crystal rather than in liquid?

I'd imagine safer because you don't have to worry a solution going bad. As long as the powder is away from light and heat it should last years, I think

So what would be an ideal consumable to drop this upon?

Gummy bears?  at .5mg/1ml you'd have to be able to fit 1ml into each edible...

will 1ml of vodka seep into a gummy bear or similar 100% ?

My thought was that a sugar cube would be very good at absorbing the liquid. I ran a dry run (ie no DOC) last night and a sugar cube can easily hold 0.3 mL but can't hold much more than 0.5 mL without a pool of liquid appearing. I don't really understand your repel/absorb statement and what it has to do with hard candy.

For the sake of more accurate dosing I recommend this ratio. Trying to eyeball .1ml that is actually .5 sounds a little risky.

I have a oral syringe graduated at 0.1 mL and 0.02 mL. As I want to make either 0.25 mg or 0.5 mg sugar cubes and decided that 0.2 mL is a good amount per sugar cube that leaves me with either 18 mg/ 7.2 mL or 18 mg/ 14.4 mL of whatever liquid I choose. 


**psyke**

I don't think a gummy bear would work at all. Test and see how much liquid a gummy bear can hold, I'm willing to bet it's less than a sugar cube.

No fucking way will .5mg/ml be concentrated enough for dosing on candies. 


Particularly gummy bears, which aren't very absorbent. I think when people use candies to dose acid, they put 1 drop on each candy. 


Do some tests with how much liquid you can get a piece of candy to absorb.

Is DOC a serotonin releaser? I am asking because I want to combine it with methoxetamine.


It certainly feels like it has some serotonin action to me. I get very buzzy and stimulated on DOC, with some rushes. I actually combined DOC with lower dose methoxetamine before with no bad consequences but this time I wanted to try a higher dose.

I've been reading through the last few pages of this thread and it is surprising to see people taking such low doses. It is very good, by all means, to start out low though.


That being said, my favorite dose is around 6 mg for a solid +3. Maybe my DOC is impure, (dif source than currently going around) but I doubt it because 1 mg is also lightly active.


I had some pretty pure DOI a while ago and I needed around 10 mg. Maybe my natural tolerance is high (don't really trip very often).  I find the dosages listed in Pihkal to be a bit low though.


But again, I think everyone should start low. DOC is tricky, sometimes I trip a lot harder than I expect from low doses and a lot less than I would expect on high doses. Sometimes it just seems you are chosen to have a great trip, if all that means is you are in a good tripping mood, so be it.

I have solution of 3mg/ml. 


Trial 1:

4 people took 3mg each, 2 people took 7mg 2c-p each.


Talking about DOC:


Trip come up slowly, full peak was already at around t+2.5h, and whole trip DIDN'T lasted 20 hours. More so around 14-16h. Peak lasted around 7h. At end, we smoked some cannabis, but I don't recommend that as it brings trip back but makes you unable to think without your head starting to hurt.(mental blockade, as we say). 


I consumed 7mg 2C-P, didn't experience very much (I am naturally tolerant to 2cx family).

Others that consumed DOC said that it is really first timers friendly, (but everyone was at least experienced with one psyche). They said music sounded very from god itself, and experienced visuals, but I can't describe them. They said it wasn't really life shaking experience. They also experienced euphoria, audio distortions and some people mentioned that it was really similar to acid at some point ![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif).


Can't tell much more...

Took 1.5mg (10mg/ml solution) of DOC yesterday as my first time dosing.  I was very surprised at the strength to be honest.  I wasn't expecting much from this dose but  after 2.5-3hrs I was having tripping quite nicely, mainly mentally with CEVS.  Then maybe at T+4-6 I was listening to tool and I had some surprisingly strong (or at least new) OEVs (such as hand acting like a perfect mirror).  At T+6 or 7 I suddenly got very nauseous and threw up for maybe 5 minutes.  This did negatively impact the trip but not too long after it started to fade down into a positive and bliss like state were I remained until I slept at T+14. 

Seems like I may be naturally sensitive to this one from reports I have read (which means my stash shall last longer!! ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)) 

Will try 2mg next time whenever that may be, has anyone tried taking methylone on DOC? Curious as to how that would be and thinking about trying it.

Congratulations on your test! Shame about the nausea & vomiting, quite surprising at that dose. I too was surprised by the longevity & strength of my 1.25mg. Looking forward to upping it slightly next time. However, I was able to eat on it, which was also a surprise given the stimulation this compound supplied.


I had a thoroughly nasty night on 4-aco-mipt a couple months ago. Felt intense nausea, a painful tummy & finally, violent diahorea! Tested the same chem at the same dosage the next night, no problems at all! Decided the first nights unpleasantness was due to a dodgy burger from Giraffe 8)


I'd have expected nausea & illness to be on the come up rather than so many hours in. Perhaps you ate something dodgy man, do you believe was it DEFINITELY the DOC that made you vom?


Oh, & I think that because Doc provides such an all-round, psychedelic & stimulant effect it might be a bit much adding M1 into the mix. If you do try this please go very,VERY easy. Far better to be disapointed in the results than have TOO much results! lol

The come up gave some nausea too, but faded by the 3hr point.  I hadn't eaten for 10 or 11 hours before I took the DOC, maybe I was just really hungry?   There was no chance I could have held any food down before the 8th hour after dosing, but when I did it was amazingly good ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


I think I will hold off on the m1 for now then, will titrate up and find a perfect dose of DOC by itself ![8o](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eek.gif)

Had a .75 mg oral trial followed by 1 mg insufflated test. Both were very intriguing. I honestly can't shake this feeling that DOC has some sort of magic to it that I must revisit and discover. I also had the odd urge both trips to randomly add MDMA at about T+10 into the experience(each time I got this extremely real feeling that adding MDMA to this would be a very magical combination). Since this feeling was so strong throughout both trips I figure I may as well add some MDMA to a DOC adventure sometime. The only real thought is when to do it(even after using DOC, I still feel as if I couldn't give it a 100% time-line as of yet, should have paid attention to the clock a little more!). Can't wait to see the depths of DOC.

It isn't saturated at this point. If you have a pipette accurate enough to measure this then it is safe.

Just less room for error, all I said was to be careful. Mistakes happen, fuck knows I've made them! And if a mistake happens with a highly concentrated solution it is more likely to be a big one.

I made a less accurate sounding mix, as I mentioned some pages back, of 10mg dliluted into 200 drops of vodka. I made a VERY weak solution because I wished to allergy test at an extremely low dose of 50ug. I was gratified however to find the thread below, which suggests my dilution method is actually quite accurate, comparatively.

How much liquid exactly is in a drop? Do all drops contain the same the same amount of liquid? "Drop" is not a unit of measurement!

this is very true.  Also, this "drop" method seems very tedious when one can get an oral syringe at the pharmacy for $1-$2.... seriously.  Why make it more difficult & less accurate?

Tried 2.4mg of this recently. You should have no plans when you take this, its half life is quite long., still some effects 16 hours in. I found very good visuals while maintaining a relaxed sense of state, and a detatchment which is quite unreal. You really experience the works with this substance  %)

Question:


Ive had 110mg DOC stashed away for quite some time now, and im wondering if its possible that it degraded much. When I received it, it had been kept in foil, away from sunlight, and in a room-temp environment for about a year give or take a few months. Since ive had it, its been away from all light, in foil, in an airtight bag, in a place with no sunlight, however it has been in a room-temp environment. 


My DOM has definitelly degraded being in similar conditions (only difference is the DOM has been exposed to light, and every now and then exposed to air), but im wondering if my DOC has. If so i'll probably just get some of the new batch that's going around, however im wondering if this is really necessary. 


I sadly wont have time to try it for a few more weeks, but I dont want to miss my chance with this new batch of DOC as it seems to come around every once in a blue moon, and this batch is actually a good one.


If kept in the afformentioned conditions, do I have much to worry about?

From what I've heard DOC is stable as rock. You shouldn't need to worry.

Just dosed 3mg last night, this stuff is just as fantastic as I remember. totally positive, visuals at t+20 hours (though i slept at t + 12 for 8 hours - woke up to a bit of a surprise haha), music sounded great (went to a solo ted leo show last night.. awesome!), really experienced the whole works. I definitely felt the need to push this up to about 5mg, I felt I only scratched the surface of the potential again with DOC though.

Second test, 1.5mg (up from 1.25mg a few weeks back. More of the same, longer duration & more intense vsiuals. LOTS of energy. 18 hours from start to finish. Truly awsome stuff!


Doses measured perfectly with minimum tedium & effects were as expected. 1.6mg next time!

Dosed 7mg and had an incredible trip. I'm still *amazed* at how true the "light bodyload" claim is - except this is actually a pretty big understatement - NO bodyload to speak of at all except for occasionally getting the shits bad (this seems to be random too). At this dose, my cognition was improved 10-fold.. still very lucid though.. had incredible conversations for hours. The visual and auditory distortion were great... not as fantastic as say moxy, but still up there. The CEVs were much more "LSD like" than LSD actually looks to me - VERY fractally... in a way reminded me of psilocin but less organic and more abstract. Grizzly Bear sounded amazing. Very positive, probably my favorite part... I enjoy the cynical aspect that 2c-e gives me, but at the same time sometimes I just want to feel fantastic and profound simultaneously. I really think this might be one of my very favorite psychedelics, if simply because of the positivity and minimal bodyload. Highly recommended... 


and, just get an oral syringe. I know that the drop method seems to be working right now, but the qualitative differences might not be as pronounced at the 1-2mg range even with error... if you ever push it higher (which I suggest; it is very forgiving and the visual/auditory aspect really significantly increases at high, but sub-10mg ranges), the error might be quite noticeable. Using an oral syringe (or even an insulin syringe, as I do, squirting it into the bottom cap of the syringe and downing it) really allows almost precise accuracy and it is *literally no extra effort aside from just going to the pharmacy and buying one/some for cheap*

^ Be warned that tolerance shoots up quick. Dosing weekly left me needing about twice as much in about 3 weeks time. Keep that in mind if you decide to take 7 mg or more after not having taken any psychs in a while. It will be stronger than you expect.


As far as bodyload goes, sometimes I get extremely nauseous before it quicks in. I have thrown up on it before. Also I tend to cough pretty hard on it. Same thing happens to me on mescaline too. It's weird. My muscles will get pretty tense by the end of the trip too, but usually from contorting my body and sitting in weird positions.


I really like DOC but the comedown can drag on a bit too long. Sometimes I just waste it away watching TV till early in the morning. That never feels too good. That is one of my only gripes with DOC. Maybe I just need to start earlier in the day.


I have combined DOC at around a 5 mg dose with low dose methoxetamine. Made the DOC feel very warm and fuzzy but I redosed with the MXE and it left me feeling a bit manic later on. I would reccomend waiting till the end of the trip to dose the MXE.


DOC combined with weed gave me thought loops, a phenomena that tends to happen with just weed for me. I didn't like it and won't be doing it again.

i always get my oral syringes for free.  just walk up to the pharmacy counter (not dressed like a raver kid) and ask if they have "any of the little oral syringes for dosing children's medication."  last time i went i got one that is accurate to .2ml and one that is accurate to .02ml.

Will agree with both bodyload issues... I get *slightly* nauseous about 10 min after I take it, and I think this is largely psychosomatic. Nothing near close to vomiting though. Muscle tension was slightly annoying.. but I found it easy to sleep by t + 10 hrs before muscle tension ever kicked in.


and yes, the "7mg" figure was adjusted for tolerance - I took about 14mg to account for tolerance.

How could you know its working perfectly?  There is no way to know, and a "drop" is never a standardized unit.  The dynamics of the fluid will change when it contains a solute so even if you were able to get the same size drops initially, once the DOC is in the solution the drop size/weight will change, further rendering this method inaccurate.

How do YOU know it ISN'T working perfectly!


Look, I'm not a bloody idiot. I know what I'm doing. I've got a way of measuring miniscule doses of this compound & I am working my way up the dosage ranger & am noticing differences as I increase my intake.


If you read the drops versus measured ml dosing study I linked & will link to again, you'll see that my method MAY be only slightly less accurate at worst. But may equally be entirely accurate. I only got 10mg of this, mixed it immiediately with my vodka & have dosed effectively twice from it. I won't get another chance to try this stuff unless my man gets more in so I'm going on with what I've got.


I stand firmly behind my method, as far as I can tell, & once again, I am NOT an idiot, it's working just fine.


Every drop may indeed be differently sized but it all evens out when you're using 20 drops. I've a steady hand & I watch the drops. Provided one knows how many drops one has in ones container, & how much material is desolved in the drops, viola! This is no more or less accurate than your average scale, which has a +/- percentage to some degree anyway. 


[http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/showthread.php?t=567652](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/showthread.php?t=567652)


If I DO get more, I may consider using a ml - mg ratio just to satisfy you, & for comparative purposes.

I've seen and heard  of people use volumetric measurement for various substances and *never* heard of anyone using this "drop method" until I saw this thread.  **Using it defeats the whole purpose of volumetric measurement and as this is a harm reduction forum should be actively discouraged here.** You may know to some degree what subjective effects to effects to expect from so many drops but you have no real idea what dosage you took.

Done properly (dissolving a known amount of material with a known volume of liquid), volumetric measurement can be way more accurate than most scales people use.

If anything then, my doses are likely to be UNDER, not over, because adding material to the vodka bulks it out a teeny bit.


& dissolving a know amount of liquid (be it drops or mls) & a known amount of compound is exactly what I'm doing. The only difference is that I am working on a drop-per-50ug basis rather than a ml-per-50ug basis.


You can actively discourage as much as you like mate, I'm old enough to know what I'm doing & I can't "undilute" this stuff now anyway, can I? & if I could, I wouldnt, because it'll screw up the rest of my testing. IF I get more & IF I decide to change my method, I'll let you know if there are any quantitive changes in the dose per dose effects. I doubt there will be.

I really don't care what you do so don't bother letting me know. I'd be more worried about somebody who isn't as clever as you claim to be trying this method and fucking up, ending up with a overly potent mixture.

Sorry mate, but you're just wrong in this instance. Nobody is calling you an idiot. But, you cannot know the volume of liquid contained in a "drop". A "drop" of solution is not a standardized measurement because you cannot know the exact volume of the solution in a drop, unless you subsequently measure the volume. Whether you think you know how many "drops" make up the totality of the volume of liquid you are starting with is irrelevant. You don't know the volume of liquid involved, and thus you don't know how much chemical you are ingesting. You definitely cannot be certain to measure in 50 microgram increments.


I'm pointing this out so that other people don't use this method. Especially for a substance so potent, it is pretty much the same as eyeballing.

I don't really advice using this method, especially if one is going to take the substance orally, but still, the information in TheAzo's thread sustains this method. 

You can easily obtain volume per drop from that thread, or alternatively you can just take 100-200 drops of your solution, measure this amount and then just do simple math. 


Also, if we assume that probability distribution is symmetrical, and that the dose consists of large enough number of droplets(I would say 10+), then chances dosing MUCH higher are quite low. 


I suggest conducting your own experiment with plain water before blaming this method of dosing.

Good, because I am not an idiot. And, although my postcount isnt, I have been here for YEARS & I am OLD compared to most of you here. You don't live long in this business "eye-balling" doses of Doc & in all honesty, I am fucking offended that anyone should consider my method the equivlent of "eye-balling" anything! My measurements stand up fine according to the thread about liquid dosing. I know it is safe because I am quantifaibly aware of the subtle difference in my dosage increments. My main concern with Doc is it's strength so my compound is highly diluted, 10mg in 200 drops. Using the same dropper & the same container, the amount of liquid didn't change once I added the material. If it changed it must have increased the size of my drops by some miniscule amount too, because there were still 200 drops in my bottle AFTER I added the material.


Yes, clearly a "drop" is not an accurate measurment of LIQUID. But drops average out & if my solution is so weak that I need 25 drops to get a threshold of, say, 1.25mg I really doubt that the active amount has varied by more than a few micrograms.

Me too!


I cannot recomend this method to anyone else, as it's the first time I've gotten anything other than Phenazepam that needed liquid dilution to measure allergy testing doses & because there seems to be some distress about it in this thread. Those in distress need only know that I am quite certain that, when I think I've had 1.5mg of Doc I've had damned close to 1.5mg. Close enough that I am confident about making that claim. I would not claim anything here in public, something that could affect someone elses health if I were not damned certain of it. I am deeply disinclined to overdo Doc in dosage or regularity & advise anyone using psychedelics to take the same if not MORE precautions.


Once again, to suggest that I, a grown adult with more years of drug experience than most of you have had on the planet, am being irresponsible, is offensive to me & I'm not gonna pretend otherwise.

Well sorry, you sound like an idiot to me. OR rather, incredibly stubborn and arrogant. Having years of psychedelic experience in no way qualifies you to eyeball the volume of irregular drops. Many very experienced posters here have given you *factual* reasons why you are simply wrong, and you refuse to acknowledge them. This is stupidity and irresponsibility. This has nothing to do with already having diluted the solution; *all you have to fucking do is buy an oral syringe (or maybe get one for free) for at most a very minimal sum.* What the fuck is the problem? You are being stubborn to the Nth degree. I'm not going to "pretend otherwise."

using pipettes or oral syringes or whatnot *will* still be more accurate than the drop method though ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  i'm not one to talk though, i once dosed DOC with a teaspoon because i couldn't find my oral syringe.

Yeah, I mean as long as you're not going to DIE (which improbable if you have ANY reasonable experience eyeballing) and you admit that it's stupid/inaccurate, fine by me. just don't try to dicksize your 20 years of experience while doing something blatantly stupid. There are some IDIOTIC "experienced" oldies; someone smoked 20g of am-2201 in a month. yet he is a 50 year old hippie..

It's ironic that whenever anybody starts using this argument it makes them appear really fucking immature. You have idea how old "most of us" are and besides, age does not equate wisdom! I'm sure there are people here much younger than me that are very knowledgable.

Hey guys, what is a good carrier I can use to lay 80 proof DOC solution onto for travel purposes? (gotta go thru the airport soon..). The solution is 15mL to 200mg DOC.... I'd like to dose around 3mg per dose. I tried using altoids but they get oversaturated by even .3mL and cannot hold the entire solution. Maybe sugar cubes? Something bigger, at any rate I think...

sugar cubes are the first that that come to mind. why don't you just keep the solution in a eye drops container? i'm 99% sure you can bring them on a plane because the container is so small. you might want to google to be sure but I brought some within the past year and was fine (before the backscatter machines were deployed)

I'd think a bag full of sugarcubes would be a bit suspect.  What are you going to tell security, that you like your tea with 40 lumps?

I found that sugar cubes can hold about .4 mL before they start to leak or disintegrate. I believe that when people dose on candy they either put use a small amount of liquid or multiple candies per full dose. 


The latter is what I plan on doing. Either 0.25 or 0.5 mg per sugar cube so that the dose is flexible.

You can carry liquid under 4 oz. Put it in an empty eyedrop container, or contacts case, etc. Easy.

sorry to harp on this, but BL's stated purpose is harm reduction, and we're simply discouraging this method because someone could more easily screw up & end up in a bad situation than with standard volumetric dosing.


The DOC in solution doesn't "bulk up" the volume of the liquid, it just changes the density, a slight distraction could result in miscounting drops, one could squeeze the dropper bulb (or god forbid sweet breath or eyedrop bottle) at different pressures from time to time, etc.


Ultimately its your body & your decision, and according to theAZO's thread, if done carefully the method you speak of can be fairly accurate.  However i personally wouldn't be comfortable with "fairly," but like i said earlier, ultimately your decision.  And this would be different if people were trying to convince you to buy a $200 electronic pipette, but oral syringes are available from free up to $2 or $3, just seems both simpler & more accurate.


If you were to buy an oral syringe you could still use your solution by subtracting the amount you've already taken (i'd say account for an additional 10-15% as per the margin of error noted in the other thread), measure the amount left, & do a little math ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

Fair enough, I stand corrected ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)


I dont have tolerance to Phens but I guess that could factor into the "drops" equation too. & of course, there's no real guarrantee that my scale or that of my mate measured 10mg with complete accuracy.


I feel pretty certain, in case anyone hadn't gathered that, that my measurements are accurate enough & given my experience with psychedelics the effects appear to correspond with those reported by others & correlate with my low weight & lack of tolerance. I had a considerably stronger & more difficult trip on 2c-e recently & I'm 100% certain my measurents were entirely accurate at 14mg. I got a very firm +3 from this, for a good 8 hours plus! This trip was much more intense than either of my 2 Doc experiments.

I think I should probably not complicate matters by changing halfway through. I really COULD make a mathematical error if I change my technique now.

Yup, watercolor paper #14. You perforate them yourself if you want them perforated. I love my phenazepam and 5-meo-mipt blotters, can't wait to get my DOC, DOI, and DOM and turn them into blotters too :D.

If you're going to perforate them using a sewing machine, do so before you lay the chemical on there. Same with if you plan on printing anything on the watercolor paper. Also, if you plan on printing something on there (like the name of the chemical on the paper so it doesnt get passed off as something its not, or just so you remember), try to print it using soy ink so it causes less havoc in your body.

I posted this in ADD but I think it is worth posting here as well for future researchers.


I have finally come to realise that I might have some impure DOC and it's not just my psych tolerance.  Might be around 50% pure, according to the dosages listed in PIHKAL. Does anybody know what any possible impurities could be and if they could be harmful? How about anyway to clean it?

^No purple tint. This DOC is light and fluffy and very white.

i took 1mg of DOC when i had a cross tolerance from taking 2c-p the day before.  i felt almost no psychedelic effects, but i had a VERY heightened emotional response that surprised me quite a bit.

hm perhaps i should have elaborated a bit more.


i had dosed 2c-p i think 4 times in the week before i dosed the DOC... 15mg or so of 2c-p the day before felt closer to like 5-7mg felt without tolerance.  consequently i didn't really expect ANYTHING from that 1mg of DOC, but i ended up being pleasantly surprised with a threshold response that brightened up my night nicely.  ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I was going to suggest the exact same thing.  Just do a little math equation and make up an area that is equivalent to the amount of DOC you would like to have per X amount of space.  So say, mark 1/4 X 1/4 " squares and work out how much DOC you would like on them.  If not just purchase blotter "art" from Ebay or something.  In fact, if you did that, you could just put it in a plastic sleeve in a binder with other assorted art work/news clippings/whatever. 


Because I would not want to put DOC in water or anything else that may cause it to degrade.  And I would not want attempt to carry an alcoholic solution on an airplane.


You could then wrap the blotter in a very thin layer of saran wrap, put it in the middle of a bunch of business cards or such and put it in your carry on luggage.

Something a friend of mine told me recently. Just good to know.

The higher the lb/#, the thicker and more absorbent the paper.  Either way, 140# is standard, but nowhere near the most absorbent... you can even get 300#.

Yeah originally when I saw that purple hue I just thought fuck... this probably 50% unreacted chlorine or something! Happily I was wrong!


Also to the guy worrying about the airport, here is what you do. Go buy a little mini bottle of alcohol. Volumetrically dissolve your DOC (I do 25mg / 25ml soln. made of 20% alcohol) and put that into the bottle. Close it up, throw it in your checked luggage, and be done with it.


I put a little parafilm around the bottle top because I don't trust it, but otherwise you're good to go. However, please don't leave it in that alcohol bottle at your destination because at some point, someone WILL chug it and a 3-day trip of pure dysphoric insanity or a hospital trip will ensure.

Thanks, that's a great idea! It's already too late and I ended up leaving it at school, but that's a fantastic idea for future volumetric drugs that I want to transport. 


I also ended up dosing 13mg on two wheat thins (as 6.5 on each) and *accidentally ingesting all of it in the airport*... needless to say this was an extremely intense experience. Luckily, it turned out completely fine, even fantastic - but I would caution everyone to be reaaaally careful, I saw the potential for this to be really overwhelming and negative if I hadn't my partner to talk me down.

WTF - 13mg at the airport? How did you survive the flight? 


Details are needed! Can't cocktease with a story like that. And why of all things did you choose wheat thins? How did you accidentally eat them? Sounds like an epic trip report could come from this.

Well, in a stupid careless mix up I somehow had miscalculated how much i had put on, as in made a simple mathematical error while dosing with the syringe. looking back at the numbers and the intensity of the trip its clear i dosed about 13mg instead of 3-4 i had intended. i hadn't intended to dose it but i got irrationally nervous carrying the thins through security and decided, since i'm well acquainted with 3-4mg doses (which tend to leave me completely mentally lucid) that i would just eat them. 


cross posted from somewhere else (i might turn this into a full TR sometime soon): 


It was probably the most visually intense trip I've had in a good while (only being surpassed by my 2c-e and LSD experience), and the DOC became a REAL (as in, included aspects that I find fundamental to a worthwhile trip, difficult ones - extremely altered mindset/thought patterns, etc), bordering on ego loss at times... all while in the fuckin airport trying to catch my flight lol. I had to throw up in the airport bathroom, which was exciting to say the least.


However, after my initial rough come up, the trip was absolutely incredible. Watching the clouds and the ocean morph color and shape constantly in beautiful synchronicity was awe inspiring - i had the feeling the entire time "this is a once in a lifetime opportunity - most people wouldn't think to trip during a flight, because it's risky, but i'm saeeing some of the most beautiful things i could ever see and wow!" My CEVs were leagues above any high dose LSD experiments and were right on par with 2ce


The bad parts though, were really bad. I could barely see in front of my face from all of the flying synesthetic visuals barraging me in the airport - combined with the crippling nausea and the panic at what I had done was really disorienting, especially while trying to get through security and onto my flight. God, what a fuckin journey ahha

man, that sounds awful. glad you didn't get arrested or anything.  The highest i've gone with DOC is 2.55mg, and that was a strong +++ for some time.  Felt pretty lucid, but didn't have to deal with anyone til about T+10 or so, so i can't be entirely sure of my lucidity... can't imagine going above 6 though, let alone 10....

What should be understand is that I (and somehow my best friend, but no one else among our friend group) have always been a hard head with dosing pretty much any psychedelic... 3.5g of cubensis bores me, 25mg of 2c-e is my "sweet spot" etc. I found the effects of DOC below 10mg fun, but not inspiring. Granted, I would still never choose to do it an airport... I'm just glad it worked out.

If it was the purple hued batch... I'm floored.  I know a few people who thought roughly 2mgs was the most intense experience they've ever had.  


I've had 3mgs at most and I was mentally fine, but that was like 16 hours of the physical world being insane.


I can't even imagine what 13mgs must have been like.


Good idea for a short term carrier, though.

1.5mg was a million times more intense than I had anticipated, and the body load was excruciating (I felt amazing, but my back... my god! The tension!). So I can't imagine a dose of nearly 10x that amount.


edit: also I find this drug super sexual and erotic. IME, it would have been perfect for an adults-only evening with the wife.

I get absolutely no bodyload from sub 10mg doses but the bodyload was pretty heavy at 13, yeah. I mean, for me vomiting on DOC was very very unprecedented.

I need to find some way to reduce the muscle tension before I take this again. I felt like I was candyflipping, which was great, but within ten seconds of peaking I realized my back and jaw were going to be in for a world of hurt later.


I've never caught myself grinding so hard and I could not get the tension in my back to release, no matter what I did. Stretching, rolling around on the floor, nothing I did changed it.


Also I found this to be a really selfish drug - I never felt a sense of connectedness or oneness. There was no transcendence or profound insight at any stage.


Currently I'm thinking this one is more of a fun drug or sex drug.


I was only at 1.5mg, and I was in the worst possible setting I could be in, but I can't even imagine what my body would have felt like at 2.0mg. I feel like I would have no teeth left and my spine would be broken.

I felt exactly the same way about this until my accidental 13mg dose. It was all of the above criteria that sadly aren't fulfilled at lower doses. But, it is quite a harrowing dose to take.

Based on my experience, I feel like your thoughts would become so manic and frenzied it wouldn't be possible to hold onto a single insight or thought at that dose. There is a good TR on Erowid where someone takes 15mg and he basically winds up in a curled up ball on the sidewalk for 8 hours.


Also, at 1.5mg, I was done with all effects by 10-11 hours, and in fact falling asleep.


I was completely done with any psychedelic / visual / stim effects by 8-9 hours, but I had a minor "fog" that didn't clear up until 10-11 hours post-dose.


I was stunned at how short the trip was, TBH. The come-up took 2-3 hours, plateau was about 3 to 4 hours and then it was a steady and smooth comedown from there until 8-9 hours after dosing.

I agree! I'm glad I'm not the only one - the majority of the effects are over after 10 hours for me, there is a very faint visual persistence for awhile after that but nothing I can't sleep through.

^ was your 13mg the purple tinted batch?   It seems the other current white batch is of just a fraction of the purple's purity.

At some point there was a batch going around which was identified as 2C-I...


I feel like I had an almost ecstasy-like hangover a day (36 hours) later too. Really foul mood, irritable and crabby... could have been other things but I slept well and it was such a pronounced effect I am tempted to attribute it to the compound.


Also quite funny how much activity there is in the DOC, DPT, 4-aco, and 4-ho threads right now...  what a coincidence!

I know! I wonder why that coincidence could be... hmmm. 


I'm gonna try 2 mg of the purple batch in a few days. I'm pretty pumped.

Try preloading with magnesium.  I personally have gotten pretty minimal bodyload from DOC, but preloading with magnesium has all but negated jaw clenching & muscle tension from methylone & MDMA.  Don't think i'll ever take an empathogen without it again.  And you can get a huge bottle of it for like $12 at the health food store or pharmacy

Dunno how many batches are going around right now, but mine is white and 2.55mg was a strong +++ for about 12-14hrs.  Full of wall melting, entire visual field encompassing, almost unable to recognize my apartment type visuals with some notable residual effects lasting an additional 11hrs.  I did sleep as the main effects were waning, but woke up still off baseline.  Felt pretty much normal around T+23

^You can get a bottle of magnesium citrate (used for a laxative) for like $2 bucks at pretty much any grocery store. It's good for about 30 solid doses of magnesium too. Just don't drink too much or you'll get the shits!

I have a giant bottle of magnesium chelate, I just didn't take any as I did not anticipate this kind of wrenching back tension. It was insane. I am stunned my back wasn't killing me the next day. 


I also attempted a psychedelic shit under the influence of the DOC because I felt like every body orifice was leaking. I was sitting there, tripping balls and sweating my sack off, and I swear I was taking a dump but then I looked in the bowl and there was nothing... then I wiped and there was nothing... a ghost shit!

Can't agree more, on 2mg for both me and a girl, we fucked for something like 7, maybe 8? hours. It was mostly my doing though, I felt so gone that I couldn't even keep track of my thoughts and over and over I just kept finding this awesomely naked girl. Great time.

**Cloak effect**


It seems like Shulgin described a 'cloak effect'...could this be what you are experiencing - physically- with the jaw and back muscle contraction....


Or is it the Telemere Factor...


Glad there have been lots of postings - good information to make future decisions...

I finally have some access to DOC!!!!!


The stuff I have access to is purple tinged in colour. Am I correct in thinking that the most potent batch about is the purple-hued DOC? 


Can't wait to give this a go - looks incredible! Dosage sensitivity looks a bit of a nightmare though, so will have to be particularly careful with it. I'm stoked, as it is tied with DOM as the chemical I'd most like to try!


I seemed to have developed a bit of an obsession with this compound - after reading a number of hugely fascinating trip reports. Had nothing but incredible experiences with 2C-P, so I have really high hopes for this compound.

These reports about massive muscle tensions with the purple batch are weird, I have taken white crystalline DOC (first european batch) up to 12mg and even at this dose the bodyload was much milder than what I get from 20mg 2C-E and on par with 60mg of 4-Aco-DMT (that is to say mainly nausea).

Does anyone know if there is any probable cross tolerance between this and MDMA?


Say if one was to take MDMA on a friday night, then take this on a Saturday evening, would a significantly diminished response to the DOC be expected? Or would there be very little impact?


I'm not concerned about negative moods post-MDMA, as I usually experience a strong afterglow the next day.

I tried DOC for the first time tonight (its my first experience with any of the DOX compounds) and all I can say is WOW!!!!!!! 


This compound is very odd indeed! It is by a wide margin the most visual compound i've ever tried, yet, despite the almost sensory-overload visual aspects, my mind is so very clear - I could easily program a computer or solve a complex technical problem in this state. Its really very odd how one aspect (the strength of the visuals) can combine with the super-enhanced level of clear headedness, compared to a day-to-day state.


This chemical reminds me greatly of 2C-P but feels far cleaner - almost like a refined version of 2C-P. A far higher Signal:Noise ratio it seems.

clubberdude, going by the timestamps on your last two posts, I'm guessing you are 5-6 hours into your DOC experience.  If that is the case, you may still have a long ride ahead of you, hopefully as rewarding as what you have reported so far.


I've read both good and bad things about the DOC body load.  I'm curious what your dose amount was.

Yeah, I've put together a trip-report of such (rather the chronology of the chemical, as opposed to types of visuals etc). 


I'll be posting it here when the experience has ended.


I did 4mg orally, and around 2-3mg nasally.

DOC reminds me greatly of LSD except it's got more of a strong, physical push which can be extremely euphoric.  it lacks the nasty body load that other DOXs can have.  At this point in time I actually prefer it to LSD, because LSD has yet to provide me with much, whereas I have had some incredible experience on DOC.

For the record, I have found DOC to have vastly stronger visual effects than LSD - where the visuals for me are relatively subtle. Also DOC is more euphoric - has a degree of unadulterated, carefree bliss than many of the tryptamines can be.


I'd have said that the visuals that I've got of DOC are very similar to the imagery seen in this video. Certainly seems to be in that order of complexity.[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T19M9JQFERU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T19M9JQFERU)

Now that things have died down and people have gotten to experiment with this a few times is it worth stocking up on considering it's not often available but now is?

I'm considering getting a few doses and just having them stored in a vial for in the future - it's unlikely I'll dose often due to the long duration.


How is the chemical itself though? To be honest, I'm only really a fan of the standard psychedelics like LSD/Psilocybin because the likes of the 2Cs carry far too many side effects for what they are worth in comparison to say acid. Is this a good clean psychedelic like LSD with little side effects - I'm not comparing it to LSD visual/headspace wise, more so does it give bodyload, nausea, etc; for example 2c-e is definitely going to make me sick. I personally find RCs only really worthwhile if I can't get my hands on the standard textbook drugs, but this one has been around for a long time and sounds interesting. 


Would I be better waiting for another DOx to come around? How does it fare in comparison to them?


- Few questions there, hope some people can answer, even just a single one.

There seems to be no consensus on that... for me and some others, DOC has one of the lightest body loads of any psych. 


For others (see Jbrandon's trip report) they seem to find it absolutely physically exhausting. Not sure what the deal is, tbh.

I took 2.5mg of the purple-ish tinted DOC and experienced a pretty janky bodyload the entire time, it was absolutely exhausting. I couldn't find any benzos for a while and it was very taxing existing in that state. Finally a friend got me 3 ambien (only thing he could find) and those helped the body load for a few hours a piece but even with those I was worn very thin by the end of the trip. I've took a handful of the 2C's and enjoyed them all very much and could easily tolerate the bodyload but this stuff didn't agree with me at all. I was very excited for this one too ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)

As I said earlier it's quite strange that nearly all bad-bodyload-reports are from people working with the purple batch, maybe it's due to an impurity... It could be great if you could try again with the white batch.

I also read someone say the purple batch is alot more potent... someone reported being flummoxed by just 1.5mg, plenty-o trippy effects, low bodyload.  Perhaps the person who took 2.5mg did too much?

 also a good point.  if it is more potent for psychedelic effects then perhaps the side-effects will show up at lower dosages as well.

Body load isn't really any worse than that with 2C-P or LSD, but I noticed what might have felt like some mild vasoconstriction during the time I took it, but this may well have been imagined. I took 4mg orally, and insufflated a total of around 2-3 mg several hours later. The vasoconstriction feelings did not begin until a short while after insufflating the second dose. My heart rate was surprisingly low during the peak of the trip - within around 5 bpm of my typical resting heart rate. At these doses, whilst the visuals were very strong, I felt pretty in control throughout. In fact effects were milder than I expected from that dose, but may have been because I used MDMA the night before.


Next time i'll dose fully orally, as it seems potentially safer. There is absolutely no safety or toxicity parameters about DOC anywhere on the internet, so its best to start out carefully with this one.


My batch is the one with the purple tinge to it.

should have some on the way shortly and believe research will start at the 3mg point but I'm always needing to hold back my wish to do a strong/heavy dose due to my diverse tolerance issues 


brains chemistry is a little funky to say the least


tolerance for LSD is not to be mentioned - its up there even after no dosing for years...


2-ct-2 was enjoyable at the 25mg range but nothing great 


MDA won't do nadda unless over 500mg's is consumed 


MDMA will rock the socks at 100mg 


research is being continued at the 10-20mg range (insulfated) on 4-aco-dmt and soon to be hitting up 4-ho-met

I had to throw up in the airport bathroom, which was exciting to say the least.

Well... Excuse me but do you mind if I call you a complete fucking idiot!?! Don't you come on here, ripping shit outta ME coz I choose to dose DOC using a drops-per-50 microgram, dosing in the 1.25mg-1.75mg range & then confess that you "accidentally" dosed DOC in the THIRTEEN mg range immediately prior to getting on a fucking airplane. You complete fucking hypocrite!


I am coming into a further small supply of this fine shite & I have every intention of diluting it in EXACTLY the same way as I have done previously WITHOUT any problems at all. I am NOT suggesting ANYONE use my dosing or dilution method but for the sake of continuity I have decided to continue with the same method & bollocks to anyone who think I am "stupid" for doing so. Just because YOU or anyone else thinks something is RIGHT, does not make it so! I know what I'm doing & I'm sticking with it. If something goes wrong I'll be the first to come on here & admit it.


In the meantime would anyone dosing this compound please show a little more intelligence than those who've criticised me for a lack of caution. Coz, as you can see from that which I have quoted, they're not as fucking smart as they think they are!

Originally I wanted to get some of the white batch as well to compare, but from what I have read, some people taking similar doses to mine from the same supplier (purple batch) report almost no body load. 


I think this one comes down to personal chemistry and variations in dosing (we're definitely not all getting exact doses to 2 decimal places beyond a mg).


I also trust the supplier of the purple batch and he provided GC/MS scanned reports to prove his purity.


I'm going to try the DOC again, this time at 1.0mg, within the next couple of weeks and see if it's more tolerable.

you can't just develop a massive tolerance to MDA without developing any tolerance to MDMA, they have a similar (albeit not identical) receptor profile and I dunno how you could possibly need over 500mg for MDA and 100mg for MDMA.

Tried 8 mg DOC 3 days ago.

Weight : 45kg

Height : 1m66-68


What a crazy ride. Very funky psychedelic and long lasting! Bodyloads are mellows, experiences some tension & spasms. Slight increase in heartbeat & blood pressure. Bodyloads are not very strong compared to DOI.


Sweet stuff i love it ! (Beware 8 mg was INTENSE!, i'm experience with DOI up to 6mg so for me it's "easy" to keep cool on DOC).


Peace, be safe!

Consumed 7mg of the purple tinted DOC, dissolved in distilled water. 


Observations: Experienced the same type of body load as before - persistent nausea on the come up, once I purged myself very minimal body tension and virtually nothing else.


Conclusion: The purple tinted DOC is the same as the white DOC I have previously experienced. I can't believe people thought that somehow this purple batch was some "super potent" DOC or something... come on now. 


The trip:


A fun, tumultuous and totally heart-strain night! 


t + 0: DOC taken. Feel faint nausea and anxiety mere seconds after ingesting, psychosomatically induced symptoms I assume. 


t + 30: Feeling very faint effects, visual and auditory, nausea has not become pronounced yet so I take a shower. There is no music playing, yet I feel very musical and sing some of my favorite Beatles songs with no accompaniment and don't miss a note. This is a very musical drug. 


t + 50: Purged. That felt good. I am engulfed in quite a fuckton of fractals and loving it. Getting the phenethylamine "fan effect," where it looks as tho a fan is blowing very high speed across the ceiling - I get this on 2c-e as well. Very much enjoyed, but we have to turn the actual fan off because it's a bit much, haha. 


t + 2: The night gets interesting. I am with one other person on DOC (5mg), and 4 others on low dose mushrooms. We are feeling a bit "loki the prankster" tonight and decide to shake things up a bit, because that needs to be done sometimes. We go to a large field whilst peaking and light $200 worth of good fireworks off in one haphazard explosive device. We give the national Mall a run for its money. Then the night gets *really* interesting. Three vans, who we now presume to have been irate neighbors masquerading as cops, circle around us very pointedly in the field, closing in on us. At this point we book it at break neck speed in pitch black to the car and make it out fine, like we knew we would... but it was still quite exciting anywho. I haven't had a perceived LEO chase in a long, long time lol, early high school days.

^thanks for the report.


I just got hold of some of the lavender stuff. What would you guys suggest as a good +++ dose for someone who likes 2c-i at 22-26mg, 2c-t-7 at 25-40mg, or 2c-e at 12-15mg?


I was thinking about 2.5-3.0mg for the 4th of july, does that sound in line with other people who have similar phen-response as me?

I would caution against that high of a dose. My 2C-x tolerance didn't appear to have anything to do with my reaction to DOC. I am fairly hard-headed when it comes to the 2Cs. However, I'm very sensitive to amphetamine, and man oh man if my DOC experience wasn't more in line with that.


I'd try 2.0mg at the most for a first time. You won't be bored.

Would it be possible to dissolve 20mg or more of DOC in 1ml 75% Ethanol. So i would have a 2mg/0.1ml concentration and could drop it with a 0.1ml syringe on sugar cubes?


My only question is if this will completely dissolve in this small amount of Ethanol or other liquid, i don't want other suggestions or instructions. I'm aware that this would be a high concentration. I have a very good scale and syringe to measure it out.

The new white crystalline batch seems to be much more soluable than batches from a few years ago for some reason. Older batches always needed a little heat to dissolve even at low concentration.

Why the fuck are you guys taking 5 or 7mg of DOC? Is your stuff so impure? I thought 2mg should be a potent enough dose. I'm speaking about the white european batch tough.

tolerance builds quickly, and high doses are really manageable with this stuff.  unlike a lot of psychedelics, DOC is often both forgiving and rewarding in higher doses.

Look, Pihkal/Tihkal doses may be "low" but I bet his purity was consistently higher than an Indian/Chinese lab where no one is regulating production.


If you're playing with DOC, don't be swayed by the higher dose reports for your first time. Start low. I'm not saying it isn't fun or rewarding at a higher dose, but you don't know how you're going to react. Look at how all over the place the TRs are for this stuff. I think there may be some measurement issues (shit scales, etc.) but still...

I've taken both a white batch and the purple tinted batch that everyone is convinced is pure. Both doses have been the same for me, around 6-10mg. I'm sorry that you can't accept some people require, or like higher doses. It's not really something that I can help, but 2-5mg bores me, where as above the visuals get incredible and the headspace is interesting. It's not overwhelming for me at such doses either. I'm not going to change my enjoyable dose because some people require smaller doses :/ I started with 2mg and found it quite uninteresting, it's not like I just started going balls to the walls.

I've had both batches. Both batches have produced experiences of intensity for people at 2mg and at 7mg. *Why* no one can except that some people are naturally inclined to dose differently on this chem as opposed to *every other psychedelic out there,* is completely beyond me. It's not some kind of fuckin dicksizing lmao, if I could get the same experience out of 2mg rather than 7, I would take that in an instant, I don't like wasting chemicals. 


People are just being weirdly judgmental about peoples' unique idiosyncrasies when it comes to this come. DOC is a psychedelic like any other and variations are there. I just dunno why this is so hard to see.

People love being judgmental, I think humans are hardwired that way... makes us feel superior to those we are scolding.


Thanks alot for your perspective, IamMe90.   I LOVE psychedelics as well as stimulants, so I will probably love this, just got some of the purple batch.  A little afraid of it to tell the truth.  I guess I will start with 2mg, but maybe 1.5... read about someone being blown away by only 1.5mg of the purple.

I hope you don't think I'm coming down on you man, I have no issue with anyone taking a big-ass dose of this stuff who knows what they're doing. 


I'm just trying to caution anyone who just got their hands on this stuff for the first time from jumping right into the deep end of the pool!

I think you should be fine on 2mg. I took 2mg and went to an aquarium and managed to hold myself together. This was my first time tripping around other people.

i had the pleasure of trying doc for the first time about a week ago. i took 5 mg pure doc (split 10 mg with my brother) and slipped into the most INTENSE comeup of any substance i'd ever experienced...about 3 hrs in length. once i got past that bitch of a tweaky, nauseous, high-speed rollercoaster through hell, it was a glorious ride. what a SWEET fucking drug. i was tripping my balls off with geometric shapes and patterns behind every object, somewhat comparable to the intensity of the hallucinations with 4 hits of really good acid. also, the euphoria that went along with it was strong and present the whole time. yes, this drug truly lasts a full 24 hours and even a little more if you take a higher dose as in my case. 


also, regarding the amount needed to trip- i do believe that 2-3 mg would be a very enjoyable and manageable experience, but because most of the people posting on this forum are very well versed with psychedelics, a much higher dosage is still possible to control...and way more fun :D 


but seriously...doc was way cool, and i'd definitely do it again EVEN though i couldn't take in food for a full 8 hours after ingestion without hurling it up suddenly and violently 30 mins later haha. that was the worst part but can totally be prevented next time. idk if that was just me, but i'd suggest to just eat beforehand to avoid the possibility ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I second that. Although I did take 7mgs (and it was reasonably intense, though totally manageable), I did use MDMA the night before (and theres likely some degree of cross-tolerance there), and I regularly take an SSRI, so probably some degree of serotonin downregulation is at play, increasing my tolerance to both Phenethylamines, and in particular, Tryptamines. I gauged increasing the dose carefully according to how I felt.  


Dosing low for a first attempt is pretty important here because of the long duration of the chemical. That said, I found it mentally pretty forgiving (see my trip report on DOC), and there was an immense state of calm during the trip.


To add to the point above, 97% purity is pretty good - that means 5mg of powder will contain 4.85mg of DOC, which is a barely significant difference.

the DOC will last longer than the water... you really should mix in a bit of alcohol to make sure that bacteria doesn't grow in your DOC solution.

I eyeballed the crystals between 1-3mg, I know it's stupid. But was very clean, only vomited saliva twice, but uttered weird violent phrases during my bus ride home. I puke now after taking 2c-b, 2c-i, 2c-t-2, and especially after 2c-e (which i still think is great(especially snorted at 10mg )). DOI R-Isomer at 8,2mg was awesome (3D HD vision) with mephedrone and JWH-xxx, beers but that was a puke/shit fest. DOC up to 3mg is forgiving I think. Over 5mg its harsh like DOI.

one of the things i was most afraid of was that i would get tired of tripping and be ready to get it over with by the end of the 24 hours...but the euphoria seriously lasted the whole time and i loved every minute of it up until the moment i was (FINALLY) able to fall asleep. haha hope you enjoy! ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

How long before dosing should one take magnesium in order to prevent muscle tension? I've also wondered this with 2c-e. I just don't know if it's supposed quite a bit before you take it or an hour before or what.

if you want to dissolve say 20 mg of DOC into 40ml of liquid to get a .5mg per ml ratio, but you want to store it, would you in fact use 20ml of distilled water and 20ml of high grade alcohol? Or would you use 40ml of water and 40ml of alcohol? I don't even know whether or not the DOC will mix with the alcohol the way mixes with water (sorry i'm retarded, but help would be much appreciated)

Yes, if you want a 0.5mg/ml ratio then you want to make the final volume 40ml. So 20ml distilled water + 20ml alcohol is recommended. I use vodka for my solutions, which is 40% alcohol, or 2:5 ratio of alcohol to water. This is plenty to prevent bacterial growth.

I also use same ratio as Survived Abortion. Vodka. (Trojka if you want to know).


DOC, people seem to like it a lot, the ratio of positive vs negative experiences (p/n) is quite high, and I am quite happy to see that, because we are going to try it soon. I already tried 1mg dose, quite euphoric and humoristic mental space I must say. A lot like LSD but still not quite it - LSD is very sharp and direct, very clear headed, while DOC is quite soft on both mind and body, also clearheaded. I tried LSD only one tab, and DOC 1mg, separately. 


I have to add I have tried 2c-i, 2c-e, 2c-c and 2c-p and many other non psychedelic drugs, and I find only 2C-I and 2C-I+2C-C combo worth ingesting. I am not visual person (I don't hallucinate much), but I appreciate body load, mental space and euphoria from those drugs. I cannot rate visuals because I do not get them ![:!](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/argh.gif)

Does anyone else need about 10mg or more to really fly with DOC? I feel like I am living in an alternate universe. Anything less than 8mg I find quite boring. I have yet to surpass 10mg but I wasn't even really satisfied with the intensity of the trip at that dose.


Looking forward to combining it with some MXE later.

If you need 10mg to get going then you've got some very unique chemistry or you've got some cut product. The cutting and misrepresenting is more common than you'd think, a few years ago someone was trying to pass off 2C-I as DOC according to some reports at a different site.

I don't find it interesting until 7mg +. Had the purple... I just need more, I guess. At lower it is very, very mild to me. A very dull trip for 20 hours.

If I took 3-4mgs of DOC, but found it too mild, would taking another couple mgs heighten the trip? I know sometimes redosing isn't very effective.

boosting with another couple mg should work if you're not more than 6 or so hours in... remember that DOC can take a few hours to kick in in the first place though...


and to you guys reporting big doses, i gotta wonder if you're not just noticing the accrual of tolerance... i don't think the one week rule applies with this stuff since its duration is so long...

you really shouldnt have to take 7+ mg of DOC to trip. as an experienced psychonaut and hardhead, I find 2.5-3.5mg to be my sweet spot. Anything over4- 5 and i cant see 2ft in front of my face..not to mention the bodyload comes on strong at that level. Ive got a good deal of experience with the compound; for this past new yrs party i had about 30 ppl over and out of those 20 or more ate the sugarcubes, which had 2mg each on them. A few ppl decided to eat two, including myself..the ppl who ate two seperated themselves fro the rest of the party and went upstairs and layed down in the dark in awe of the visuals.


Somebody rolled a fatty at one point, and although i warned that it would increase effects to smoke, no one listened. They just laughed away ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


i ended up having two ppl freak out after that. i had a clan of crazy kids to babysit till the next afternoon..lol


needless to say no one found 2-4 mg boring out of over 20 ppl. since then i got a batch of what i can only assume is anothr isomer or something bc 1.5-2 mg of this new shit and you are fucking done for 24hrs+..


 so idk man maybe youre shits weak...?that sux- wish it wasnt against the rules to share. it shouldnt take more than 4mg, at the most, for a phenominal experience IMO.

YMMV indeed.


wasnt trying to rip on your shit btw,


just sayin thats alot..crazy. have you tried a few different batches yourself?


oor..maybe a cross tolerance issue..do you take other amphetamines regularly?


medications i.e.ssris?


7mg of the most recent batch ive got would dominate you for a good weekend or so.we had an ongoing joke our moto was "still trippin" the next couple days where we'd wake up still tripping go to sleep, wake up again..mang still trippin lol. and that was a couple mg

These get sold here as LSD more frequently than any other place in the world. Check out the DOI wiki page ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


You need at least 2 weeks between trips for this stuff, probably longer. The same amount roughly 7 days later will be around 1/2-2/3rds of full effect.

I found boosting with DOC to be supremely effective nasally. I added 1 mg insufflated to 3 mgs orally and it felt like the best/most effective redose I had ever taken. It really put me into a place I wanted to be. However in a couple of weeks i'll be researching DOC again and was wondering what everyone thought of trying 4.5 mgs orally this time. Last time I definitely could have taken more even after the nasal redose. So 4.5 or just shoot straight for 5? Benzos and everything needed to calm a crazed man will be apparent so a little going a little overboard wouldn't be to bad. I also don't know why everyone is so debative about people and the doses. I've noticed phenethylamines seem to be much more all over the place dosing wise versus tryptamines. Considering i'm almost fairly positive theres only two *major* distributors for DOC and these two were both tested at 98% DOC, that people want to debate with others about the doses their doing. As long as you bought it direct from one of the majors, it should not be cut and should surely be 98% DOC(unless what extreme heat during shipping degrades?). This means its just individual pharmacology just like it is when someone claims they need 30-50 mgs of 2c-e for a decent trip and I know most everyone has seen someone claim this especially on a big forum like BL. People seem to be advising dosing well anyways, all the big dosers still adivise the first timers to be sure to take it easy on the dose as the duration of this one isn't one to fuck around with. To be honest though if you really want to fuck with something as potent as DOC and toy around with a big dose the first time you do it with only references like natural tolerance, you deserve to be fucked in the ass for 23 hours(to bad when DOC/psychedelics fuck people they lose it and run nude down the street!).

Sorry, didn't mean to come across so harshly but I seemingly to have to defend my DOC dosages here a lot. 


I've tried a few white batches and the highly regarded purple batch, no cross tolerance issues, I don't take any sort of amphetamines regularly and the trips were far longer than two weeks apart, I'm not on any type of SSRI etc. 


I'm not so sure if just because a drugs duration of action is twice as long, means that you can conclude it's tolerance will last doubly long. I mean, does mushroom tolerance take only half or two thirds of a week to decrease rather than the standard week?

I don't think it's established or clear to assume that it would be the duration of exposure that influences tolerance. My suggestion is that it is first of all the affinity, which consequently influences the needed dose. For a number of potent phenethylamines it might seem like there is a correlation between affinity and resistance to metabolism (the latter of which is critical for duration of effects), but the NBOMe's are a fine exception to the rule. Apparently because of the cleaveable bomamine group. That amine is an important site for metabolism and almost all other psychedelics show variation in the structural formula in other parts of the molecule.

Looking at these NBOMe's and at DOX compounds as well we can infer that the affinity is what measures the extent of effects on receptors, which makes sense since a great affinity means a good fit (although there still has to be receptor activation otherwise you end up with an antagonist) and including the effects on the receptors can very well be tolerance from upregulation.

LSD has a high affinity but I think it acts strangely and as a sort of partial agonist if I'm correct, also cascade effects are from what I remember thought to be responsible for what it does so it may not fall into the same rules.


DMT shows us though that the exposure can be so very short that whatever the affinity is there is just hardly an opportunity to cause upregulation. I expect oral DMT to produce tolerance, never really thought about it or heard about it but to me it would fit the pattern. So duration of exposure still is a factor in all this, but not a primary one since a lot of psychedelics last for more than an hour.


Experience seems to tell us that beyond very short exposure there is a sort of minimum of a tolerance period. Perhaps weak psychedelics cause no more than a half week's tolerance but less than that is difficult. Perhaps the reason for this minimum is the same reason that the only compounds we include here follow a minimum of affinity and activity so of course the activity you experienced is correlated with the tolerance you get. Coarsely you can say that if you get a super weak trip you have less reason to worry about tolerance than if you get a very strong one.


Comments would be welcome. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

No need to freeze or refriderage. DOC is very stable.

I, and my two friends had 3mgs of DOC. Quite nice&euphoric and not so intense experience, I'd say. Sleep wasn't hard (with help of THC). I liked the amphetamine part of DOC and playing with ball was even easier than being sober (trails helped me catch the ball). Swimming was also perfect, felt like I was floating in the air. Being in public wasn't hard, you don't even notice other people if you don't want to. Speaking can become quite hard though.


Where we tripped: Portorož

My apologies if this has been covered already but how do I go about making a DOC solution, can I just buy a bottle of distilled water and add 100mg to say 100ml of distilled water and then dose it from there? Will it need heat to dissolve or anything like that?

Cheers


Nevermind just read a few pages back that this should be fine, gonna go with 70ml distilled water and 30ml of 40% vodka should this be sufficient for 100mg of doc to be stored at a 1mg per ml ratio without degrading in the next few years.


Cheers again! ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

As to the debate over tolerance, in my experience it does seem to last much longer than with other, shorter-acting psychedelics. Personally, I have never dosed on occasions that were close enough together to know for sure (after days and days of continuous tripping I'm usually set for awhile.) However, I have dosed from an extremely potent batch with a friend who then took twice the amount we had taken (meaning upwards of 10mg) about 2 weeks later. He hardly tripped at all, and with 10mg of DOC....that's not just a fluke...

So I got a sample of 15mg doc which I measured on a mg scale. I put this into 30ml of vodka and my friend took 4ml on two different days and didn't feel anything either day. What did I do wrong?

Sounds like bunk product. If the DOC dissolved in the liquid, it should have had an effect. Make sure it was obtained from a reputable source. What did it look like?

In the last three months I have been experimenting with large doses of DOC, which I have taken orally in diluted water over twenty times at several different doses. At higher doses, +5 mg DOC seems to take you to a more uncontrollable interaction with past memory and therapeutically self reflection somewhat like LSD. I remember at this stage, your mind slips away as I would believe that I had completely died and been introduced to a complete dreamlike reality where usually many negative self realizations were faced and enforced on everything I thought was possible about myself.


I have also found a common bad trip or very powerful trip can be experienced in a spiral of realities where identity lost is common, where you continuously loop in your memories like a movie that continues to fast forward and rewind, I called this the loop. Which was experienced by myself about five times, and seem to activate when there was a lot going on at the location, like loud noise and new people coming into the picture. 


Even at lower doses with inexperienced psychedelic users the loop was common if they were in a uncontrollable environment, it's just their actions and the hallucinations wouldn't be as near as strong as a higher dose. A lot of time for the people who went in the loop, they won't really remember what exactly had happened in till days, weeks, or even months after the comedown. 


After about ten times however with DOC, I had learned what to expect and even if I tried extreme high doses 10mg + I could control it where I wouldn't go in the loop but just have very intense euphoria, mental and physical stimulation, and Beautiful geometric patterns with opened and closed eyes. When the eyes were closed, tunnels of colors would appear, and sometimes mask of entities with past experiences of LSD, DOC, DMT, and psilocybin mushrooms would be seen.


Though there are many profound things I would like to share that this very magical compound has to offer, there is one thing that DOC has shown me that is only comparable to one other substance I have ever done, and that was DMT. With DMT the hallucinations are much more realistic, and much more alive and intense. I had experienced a series of alien abductions with DMT, and those experiences had stayed with me forever. With DOC once however, I did with two other people. I was given 5 drops of DOC diluted into water which was approximately 7 to 8 mg of DOC, my friend was given two which was up to 2 to 5 mg of DOC, and my Uncle was give 8 drops which could of been up to 12mg of DOC. That night turned into a total nightmare as I felt the same alien presence DMT had given me before, I felt as if we all three had been totally abducted by the same force and were experimented with. I had felt is if I were placed in others life, and my deepest secrets had been revealed to everyone in the external world around me, I also felt strange telepathic connections from and external force just like I did on DMT. When I finally started to realize where I was and who I was, I realized I was in the garage walking around after the last thing I remember was being in the car listening to music with my friend and uncle. I look down to see my friend rolling around on the ground completely tranced out, and my uncle still in the car just sitting there, him too tranced out. We all ended up going inside, complete confused at each other, my Uncle was angry for some reason threatening me and my friend. My friend hit the loop after we went inside and was completely spun, and I had finally came down to the DOC high I had been used too, still tripping hard, but nothing like the shit I had just experienced. After the complete come down, my uncle went into a DOC/sleep stage for the next two days while my friend came completely down the following day along with me. None of talked about exactly what had happened in till about a month later when we all felt that a force had placed us in each others lives and we all felt telepathic signals coming towards us from some very strange force. I also will be the first one to tell you that this experience was different than all the others because it wasn't just like I was tripping, it was all so real. It's the things like this that really makes you wonder I suppose.


Also the DOC is active as low as 1mg with threshold effects such as a speedy and low euphoric high with visual distortion. 2-5mg takes up to 2 hours for full affects, however 7-10mg can sometimes be felt within 5 minutes and last up to 20 hours. Usually after 12 hours the affects began to come down and within hours and sleep are completely gone. When snorted the fffects were shorter but kicked in faster. It really stings also, and yes DOC is very bitter.

Sounds odd that you'd have no effect at that dosage. I guess you can titrate up and see where effects begin, but unless you've been using a lot of other substances and induced a psych tolerance, 4ml should equal 2mg which should be producing an effect at the bare minimum.

I also am going to run my first trials with this compound soon; It's already in the mail.

I'm very excited and optimistic about this.  It seems to be the general consensus that this is a potent archetypal psychadelic.  I've even preemptively ordered a quantity for my treasure chest, seeing as how I keep reading about how stable it is.  I'm well versed in LSD, DMT, Psylocibin, and other traditionals, but I'm only now beginning to really experiment with the new RCs.  


Definitely stoked. ![(:](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Yes, depends though. You may have weaker mental or visual effects, and some other effects untouched, or vice versa.

I've been kicking around the possibility of finally trying DOC this weekend, as it's the only weekend in the foreseeable future in which I'll have several days with no responsibilities. However, I know I'm in need of a very meaningful and insightful experience, for which I usually use DPT but I don't want to cram more than one session into these few days (trying to go easy on those receptors ![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif) ).

So, I guess my question or motive in this posting is to ask if people have found DOC particularly meaningful or revelatory? Therapeutic? 

I'd love to hear some experiences here :D

It can be purely recreational or meaningful, I found DOC similar to MDMA with it's easy going effects. It has many therapeutic effects I believe.

Very much a recreational drug for me at low doses (2mg is the max I've tried so far). It seems like there could be room for introspection at a higher dose, or possibly in a combo. For me though, this is purely a hedonistic fun drug, albeit a great fucking one ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

DOC's weird to me, it puts my brain in random mode on the peak, I have no control over most of my thoughts and they're random as FUCK. Despite that one hang-up I have about it, DOC is wonderfully deep. Taking DOI today, I'm super excited, as I've heard DOI can be even deeper than DOC.

I bet that would certainly do the trick ![8o](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eek.gif)![8o](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eek.gif)

I typically like to feel a substance out by itself the first time I sample it, experimenting with combinations after I've gotten a feel for the substance. However, this may not be a bad idea and I'll certainly consider that, I'm glad you brought it up as the thought hadn't really occurred to me. 

At the very least, ~48mg IM DPT during a DOC peak would probably curl my toes a little ![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif)

We'll see if it comes down to that.

Ah doing the double post thing, but I have some questions about the lovely DOC. 


Have there been many reports of nausea during the come-up? 4-AcO-DMT makes me very nauseous during the comeup if I drink it too fast, and I don't want something similar happening with this. Being nauseous while starting to trip really sucks. 


What sort of relationship does DOC have with marijuana? Will I have any desire to smoke at all? If I do smoke, will it potentiate the DOC? On other psychs, weed has increased the intensity of the visuals for me when I smoke before & during the trip. 


If I take a few mgs to start, how would additional doses work, if at all?

As far as nasea was considered, first two times, I hugged the toilet for a couple seconds. Wasn't bad at all comparably to other phens. Just a quick sick feeling followed by a purge then over. Worst part was maybe feeling continuing nausea for maybe 10 mins. Theres many OTC things people take and claim to work well(ginger. peppermint, dimehydriante(sp)).  I can't remember if nausea is commonly reported with this or not. As for smoking on it. It depends on the person. If you like smoking on other psyches and enjoy the enhancement you'll most likely enjoy it on DOC. The CEV's alone would make me want to tell you to smoke it up atleast once during!

the only body load problems i experience w DOC is it causes diahrrea for me(my friends say the same) at doses over 2.5-3mg. immodium or a light opiate dose does the trick for me tho ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


opiates are actually really nice for the comeup- instead of anxiousness and body load/GI problems, just a nice relaxing experience. kratom does the trick too

Smoking cannabis on DOC is good. Well, I tried it more at the end of DOC experience, and I got high as fuck. It's completely new feeling, fucking amazing.


DOC nausea is quite real (the sick feeling you get squeezes the hell out of you). But it really lasts, as others said, 10minutes to 1 hour. Still worth it :D.

Definitely will be smoking then. Maybe if I smoke before I take it, I won't be as nauseous. It may be worth it, but it doesn't mean that I won't bitch the entire time that I feel any nausea P:

Dunno about that, I never smoke before taking psyche, it just dulls experience. But I am person that doesn't get much nausea on any drug, so I don't know how much it hurts you. I can handle it nice, but if you seem to find a cure to it, my friends will be happy.

Usually psychs make me incredibly nauseous on comeup, so bad that it occupies most of my thinking. But the one time I took 4-aco-dmt and I smoked before (and also drank it slower), I didn't have any nausea. And the visuals were more intense, which is always a plus.

I recently had my 6th DOC trip! But I still havent gotten above the 1.8mg mark. I'm thoroughly enjoying this compound. There's sometime a little mild nausea on come-up but nothing serious. I usually day-trip coz this stuff is so long-lasting, so usually have perhaps some toast & a coffee in my stomach. If you have any nausea/diahorea issues with this compound I recomend taking it only on an empty stomach. It's perfectly possible to eat on it, once the effects have establised.


I've taken DOC at a London rock fest, using 1.4mg on the Sat & 1mg on the Sunday. These doses are perfectly managable in public & on the tube. The sky looks AWSOME on this psychedelic. I compare DOC to the mushroom experience, except of course it's considerably longer.


On a couple of occassions I've found myself restless-legging in bed, after my gf has gone to sleep & have had to knock it on the head. So far, I've found 20mg of valium or 3 Etizolam is enough, at the tail end of the trip, to kill it & put me to sleep.


DOC has a strong physical push so I excercise heavilly on it, usually in my local park/forest. I'm usually pretty knakkered after a trip but put this down to the walking & incessant laughing. DOC does not appear to have any obvious come-down, though this may be down to my light usage.


I'm now considering adding a shroom-like tryptamine at the DOC peak, as an experiment. Anyone mixed trypts with DOC yet???

ok guys im looking for some suggestions on where someone who found 2mgs pretty boring would go next? i had closed eye visuals for a while, had a sort of interesting (very minor and short lived) headspace for a little while, i think i passed out like 8 hours after i took it and i feel pretty much sober now, 10 hours later- id guess i would still have a couple hours to go but i just decided to call it quits with a valium. 


Its definitely something id like to explore more but i found this dose wholly uninteresting, sort of had to entertain myself for a while and then finally just decided to look at minor closed eye visuals for a while. I really thought the headspace was pretty mild and calm too, which makes me think i could probably handle myself on a little bit bigger of a dose. anyway if anyone has any suggestions for where i should jump to next- or where someone with a similar experience to mine found they enjoyed it a lot more.


fyi- i usually dont get a very strong effect from ampetamines- (natural tolerance?)  mdma tolerance could be an issue, and i did dose mescaline -(also to very minor effects) two weeks ago. oh also this is the european batch not the purple one.

i'd be hesitant to increase dosage by more than 1-1.2mg's just because the dosage response curb is quite steep for most individuals.  Also a good idea to wait at least 2 weeks between experiences to avoid tolerance. ~2.55mg of the european batch was a strong +++ for me, but YMMV of course.

If it's tolerance you just need to leave it a bit. If you're a big lad who takes alot of phens & phets, I can imagine a kinda "double-cross-tolerance" what with Doc having both psychedelic & stimulant effects.


If you insist on trying again without a *completely* clean break, from ALL psychoactives, I wouldnt bump up by more than a milligram. So perhaps 3mg... try that. If that doesnt do it for you it may be that you have some natural immunity to something in this compound. Don't get too confident though, or it might bite you in the ass!

How long should I expect a DOC comeup to be (with eating a light meal hours beforehand)? 


I know I already asked this earlier, but now my question is more specific: I took some 4-aco-dmt last saturday. If I dose DOC this friday, will there be any cross-tolerance issues?


Also, I plan to take it before a DJ performs on my campus. How would 3mg work in this situation? (Note that I have a natural high tolerance, e.g. I happily had my first 4-aco-dmt experience at somewhere around 35mgs)

The comeup for me is usually round about 2-3hrs.  I was definitely feeling it at 1hr, but not all that intensely until +2hrs, after that i'm usually a bit too discombobulated to keep track of time all that well ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

How are folks with doing this in a big crowd?  There's a HUUUUGE fireworks show this Sunday near me, draws 500,000 to the Ohio River in front of Cincinnati (the very intense, highly venerated WEBN "Riverfest" show).  I have gone to it almost every time last 30 years, and I have a very good well practiced plan I used the last 6 or 7 times to beat MOST of the gridlock afterwards... I park at a location that is about a 45min walk from the show, that is right by the freeway, and walk up there... it's a little tiring but not much.  Get to a spot behind people on the floodwall who had been camping out there all day, put on my headphones tuned to the station for the soundtrack and wait about an hour, which is the most tedious part.  Then when its done, hightail it back to the car.  Just me on my own, so there's no one to loose or keep track of.  I know the area so well I could do the walk with my eyes closed, and the whole thing is VERY familiar to me, so anxiety should not be an issue.


ANYWAY I have not tried the DOC yet (but am VERY experienced in all sorts of psychedelics and RCs) and am thinking of trying a first-time dose of 2mg, of the purple batch for this  From what I've read that SHOULD be in the moderate range of strength.


I know it tends to be speedy and so I am thinking that it should make the walk a breeze.  But I am wondering how others have felt exerting themselves like this on DOC, and also standing around waiting in an enormous crowd but I will be at the BACK of 99.999% of them in my vicinity, so I won't be crowded in or smooshed in any way at all... behind me might be a couple people then a downsloping hill in the direction back to the car with mostly empty space when the show is over, though it quickly fills with people leaving.


Does the speedy energy tend to keep you feeling "UP" and in a positive headspace?  Or is there any likelihood of getting dizzy or fatigued or upset about the crowd?  I've done this event on shrooms (which were frankly a bit much in this throng but I handled it fine), LSD (fine & excellent), 2C-I (about perfect actually, with its speediness and anti-headfuck clear-mind tendencies).  But I was hoping for something a bit more visual than 2C-I which only tends to enhance colors and give trails, so was thinking DOC might be more perfect.  The dose is really the only issue, and the fact that it will be my 1st time doing it.


Any thoughts about this plan or stories from others who have done anything remotely similar while on a modest hit of DOC greatly appreciated.

Dwayne, I think DOC is one of the most social and positive psychs there is and should be great for a crowd. I've taken it at several concerts in upwards of 4mg to very good effect. If you are experienced, I doubt you'll have any problems with 2mg in a crowd.

Hey IamMe... would you suggest dosing say 3 hours (typical comeup time I've read) before the show... or perhaps more than that say 4hrs or even 6 prior since it lasts so long and to allow some extra time to get accustomed to it before venturing into the fray?

I'm not usually a social tripper atleast in big groups but IMO DOC would be one of the ones I wouldn't mind doing in a large setting. Its pretty calm even when its say agitating during the come up or something. I also find walking on DOC to be easy, probably because of the stimulation and actually mostly find myself doing things like, chopping firewood, cleaning, or pretty much anything that involves somewhat full body movement during the come up. 3 hours in is when I would take a break and start relaxing. As far as dosing, you might as well do it a few hours early since like you stated this one has atleast a 12 hour duration for everyone and never lasts under 20 hours for me personally, like you said you will be able to become comfortable in your trip. 


Besides that I plan on trying 2c-P+DOC in around a month or so. Have to venture back a little into the P realm first.

Kay, I'll try it myself eventually then I guess ha.


Incidentally, I'm wondering about the possibility of psychosis with DOC?

Given it's classifications, coupled with the intensity of the hallucinations.. 

I've heard it is very lucid, and even proactive in thought processes, originality, and even functioning though.

Might be giving this little baby another ride tomorrow night - at a relatively low dose (3-4 mg max), though may insuffliate it exclusively, as I a) want a relatively short trip, and b) want to build a cross-section of its effects via this ROA. Of course, much depends on how many things I manage to get done tomorrow - have quite a few things to sort out.


To the poster above, the only way you'll be able to characterise its effects using that ROA is to try it yourself. Very few people (relatively speaking) have taken DOC, even fewer have smoked it. Hell I may even try this myself one day. All I will say, especially given the lack of data on safety, is start low (1-2 mg maximum), and leave it a while before redosing. I would have absolutely no idea how the bioavailability parameters differ according to the differing ROA's, and I'm not sure that data exists online (I'll probably have a little look later on).

Vaporizing produces approximately the same experience in effect and duration from all anecdotal reports, it would seem, but there isn't enough data on that subject to say anything conclusive, I don't believe.

Hello! Today we tried 1.5mg~ with friends and fucking shit, we found it to be more intensive than at 3mg. Very strange chemical indeed.

At 1.5mg it's a lot like some sort of hell strong stimulant, my jaw hurts damn. My jaw didn't hurt on 3mg, not even when chemical stopped working. (Next day jaw fine).

At 1.0mg it is completely different, it just gives you good mood. 


What the fuck? Any one noticed something similar?

Experiences vary from time to time. I've had +4's on small doses and +3's on huge doses. I find i'm the kind of person who receives all the side effects with none of the positives most times from low dose trips, maybe your similar.

Makes sense, same thing happens in 2c-x drugs but never thought about it. Until now, I am kinda afraid of taking DOC because of that. Maybe higher doses gives you much more euphoric push, changing experience completely.

All psychedelics product cross tolerance to a degree. However, 6 days in between these two should be fine as long as your dose isn't extremely minute, I'd say.

^No one can tell you for sure. Its especially iffy sinces its your first time(I believe?). You could always dose lower and bring a potent enough redose to surely kick it into gear or just take 3 mgs and bring a redose, if your experienced enough with this sort of thing.

Thats the exact reason. Low doses have all the side effects without the pluses for me whereas a high dose trip might have side effects but I can ignore them due to the nicer effects. 7

Thank you for the reassurance guys. As this would be my first time, I want to have a great time and avoid disappointment. Hopefully with this experience I will be able to gauge for myself how much to take in the future.

There's a HUUUUGE fireworks show this Sunday near me, draws 500,000 to the Ohio River in front of Cincinnati (the very intense, highly venerated WEBN "Riverfest" show).  I have gone to it almost every time last 30 years, and I have a very good well practiced plan I used the last 6 or 7 times to beat MOST of the gridlock afterwards... I park at a location that is about a 45min walk from the show, that is right by the freeway, and walk up there... it's a little tiring but not much.  Get to a spot behind people on the floodwall who had been camping out there all day, put on my headphones tuned to the station for the soundtrack and wait about an hour, which is the most tedious part.  Then when its done, hightail it back to the car.  Just me on my own, so there's no one to loose or keep track of.  I know the area so well I could do the walk with my eyes closed, and the whole thing is VERY familiar to me, so anxiety should not be an issue.

> ANYWAY I have not tried the DOC yet (but am VERY experienced in all sorts of psychedelics and RCs) and am thinking of trying a first-time dose of 2mg, of the purple batch for this  From what I've read that SHOULD be in the moderate range of strength.
> 
> 
> 
> I know it tends to be speedy and so I am thinking that it should make the walk a breeze.  But I am wondering how others have felt exerting themselves like this on DOC, and also standing around waiting in an enormous crowd but I will be at the BACK of 99.999% of them in my vicinity, so I won't be crowded in or smooshed in any way at all... behind me might be a couple people then a downsloping hill in the direction back to the car with mostly empty space when the show is over, though it quickly fills with people leaving.
>

> Does the speedy energy tend to keep you feeling "UP" and in a positive headspace?  Or is there any likelihood of getting dizzy or fatigued or upset about the crowd?  I've done this event on shrooms (which were frankly a bit much in this throng but I handled it fine), LSD (fine & excellent), 2C-I (about perfect actually, with its speediness and anti-headfuck clear-mind tendencies).  But I was hoping for something a bit more visual than 2C-I which only tends to enhance colors and give trails, so was thinking DOC might be more perfect.  The dose is really the only issue, and the fact that it will be my 1st time doing it.

Sounds fun!  The only thing i would be concerned about is driving. DOC, for me, was very intensely visual & totally fucked my depth perception.  Driving was definitely not a possibility until about T+21.  Although things died down substantially after about T+14, i then slept for about 7hrs, & woke up still of baseline, but mostly functional.  If you have a ride, i'd say go for it.  I could interact with people perfectly fine on 2.55mg, perhaps even a bit more outgoing than normal.  I also experienced some of the most intense visuals i've had in quite a long time.  Walls totally melting & such, CEV's of surreal vistas etc, good times.  Head felt pretty clear the whole time though.  And in regards to dosage timing, i'd probably dose 5-6hrs before the fireworks show just so i was well acclimated to the trip before venturing out.  Also that gives you the option of deciding not to go out if you don't feel it would be a good idea (i'd bet the possibility of that would be pretty low.)  


I didn't really find it stimulating in the traditional sense of the word.  Not at all like 2c-i's stimulation.  I definitely wasn't going to sleep during the thick of things, not so much because i was stimulated physically, things were just too damn interesting to entertain the thought of sleep, lol.  Overall, i was quite relaxed, laying on my couch just listening to music & watching the walls melt, spin, twirl, etc, for a large portion of the experience, no desire to pace around the apartment or go for a light jog like i get with some psychedelics.  Though as always, YMMV ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

It is stable and soluble in water (might take a little heating) but I would add some high proof alcohol (preferably vodka or everclear) to the solution to prevent bacteria accumulation.

if there are little flakes in my solution (half h2o/half vodka) does that mean its not fully dissolved and i should apply more heat? i tried putting it in a cup of just boiled water and it didnt seem to help it dissolve anymore. i would assume it is mostly dissolved anyway, the amount of flakes is fairly small.

According to a friend who recently supplied me with a couple very small batches of DOC his other DOxx compounds have lasted indefinitely when diluted in regular vodka & stored in the cold & dark. 


I am (perhaps unnecessarilly) wary about the other DOxx compounds but I think the world of DOC & cannot recomend it enough. It is strong, long stuff & should be used only by those with good physical & mental fortitude.


For the Cinncinati fire-works man, I do seriously hope you did not & do not intend to drive whilst intoxicated even slightly on a psychedelic. This is irresponsible in the extreme. Whatever you do that brings risk to your own life & limb you are completely free to do without limitation. As soon as your actions bring risk to the life & limb of others, you're dangerously negligent. Don't do it! If you're an experienced tripper, I really should not have to say this!

One thought - DOC is awesome! Probably my new favourite psychedelic - very unique! (up there at least with 2C-P). Had an experience verging on ++++ on this the other day - no psychedelic has ever got me to that state before. Bloody potent though. Be careful with this stuff!

^How much did you dose? 


When I tried DOC over the weekend (3mgs), it was more euphoric and ecstasy-like than a psychedelic (until I smoked some weed and then got crazy visuals, that is). I'm looking forward to taking more in hopes of something like a +++ or even a ++++ experience. \


It's amazing how much such a small amount of powder can do to your body.

I ended up doing 20mg 2C-I which to me is just like a little speed with a very slight trippy edge to it.  I am very very very very very very experienced with these things.  I agree no one should drive tripping, but I know precisely my limits and the effects of doses of 2C-I and after the long walk back to the car I was practically sober, as I knew I would be.  But thanks for the concern.

What is the duration of DOC when insuffalated? Is it shorter than oral ROA?

I'd say its similar, but the onset is far more rapid. It seems to be far more potent through this ROA however.

**Selecting Cl^3: Amount, ROA and Timing**


Intrigued by these relative PKs and effects, how would one go about designing a timeline for researching the three prototypes/generations of 4-position Cl-derivatized phenethylamines?


Looking for tips on interactions of DOC with 2C-C and 25C-NBOMe, and how to set up an initial, conservative combination including timeline & ROA.


Thinking something like:


t+0:00 = 1.5 mg DOC via dissolved liquid insufflation (LI) [aiming for reduced length of effect and increased early onset with this ROA]

t+2:00 = 20 mg 2C-C via oral

t+4:00 = 0.7 mg 25C-NBOMe via buccal blotter


With the idea to build in intensity throughout, and have a common decline so that at ~t+9:00-10:00 the effects are largely disappearing. 


Tried these individually already, but not not DOC via LI. The real questions here revolve around: 1) Amount; 2) ROA; 3) Timing.


A modeling way to do this would be to bracket the conservative outlier conditions and to perform the minimal number of experiences needed to determine what condition provides best results (although environment (set and setting) are going to make it difficult to draw strict conclusions).


But who has time to try [ROA X multiple amounts X multiple RC] combos?... While including appropriate tolerance breaks in between trials.


Any tips on negative interactions, timing, amounts in combination and ROAs are appreciated!

Insufflation of DOC doesn't appear to significantly reduce the overall duration of the chemical, (say 18-22 hours maybe as opposed to 24 hours dosing orally). Be very aware that come up on insufflated DOC is almost instantaneous - I was feeling altered within 15-20 seconds, and beginning to fully trip within 3-4 minutes! ![8o](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eek.gif)

^Oh yeah. I can't comment much on the duration(though I can say it certainly boosted it IMO)but I insufflated a mg three and a half hours into a 3mg trip and wow, hit me harder than any other insufflation after consuming the chemical previously. Definitely put me where I wanted to be and I felt it in minutes.

OOoooo, a Chloro triple stack! Very interesting. My instincts tell me this would be a lovely experience. I have no experience with a similar combo, or even with all the substances being discussed, so my contribution here is merely conjecture.


I might bump the time of 2C-C up to +1:30 instead of +2:00 (that is if we're trying to coincide a peak).  2C-C usually takes an hour to begin effect, for me anyways.

I might also hasten the administration of the 25C. I have no experience with 25C yet, but from my understanding it's around 1-1:30 for peak with buccal? So, if I were doing this and intended to have some coinciding peaks, I'd administer the 25C at t+3:00. 5 hour duration would start bringing you down around the ~9:00 mark, around the time the DOC would likely be waning as well (depending on your individual metabolism of course).


There's scattered reports of vasoconstriction with 25C, but not prevalent, seems dependent on the individual. So that and DOC's possible vasoconstriction (again, doesn't seem to be ALL individuals) might make that something to watch for. Not saying it's a certainty by any means, but keep your eyes open for that. I've heard of people supplementing a few grams of L-Arginine to combat this, which helps the production of Nitric Oxide, a vasodilator, as I'm sure you're well aware.

That's the only obvious potential negative interaction that I can see. Anyone else with more 25C experience should speak up though.

I wish you a safe journey, and be sure to tell us about it :D

I might be giving this one a shot in the near future...


Previous experiences with the DOx family have been up and down, I thought DOM was an utterly beautiful synesthesia inducing psychedelic....


And then someone gave me 10mg DOB.... and that blew all matter of dick. It would compare it to something along the lines of a bad acid trip that you tried to smoke meth to fix, and then did way too much meth on way too much acid. 8 hours of being too fucked up to do anything but sit there and feel intense.

The whole thing was a really unpleasant experience and it happened some time ago, but I will try to go more into it. 


Basically we let someone measure out 2 doses of DOB, and he gave us both way more than we had any desire to take that evening. 


First alerts included nausea sometime after an hour into the 2nd.


The 18 hour peak that gave way from that was spent locked in an apartment trying to maintain some form of sanity. Very shakey, overly stimulating in the way that a failed suicide attempt with a bottle of ritalin would be overly stimulating. We weren't quite at a level that we felt worried about our health as much as our sanity. It was so intense that we were not functional enough to operate a coloring book and crayon for 8 hours of it. After we mastered the crayon, we moved to permanent marker and a friend's tent for a canvas. She was pissed about it later, but it was not directed at me despite it being half my fault. 


Lots of crazy stuff drawn in tent. It has become daylight again, I step outside to a cold day. Its winter, but the landscape at +18h appears to be more along the lines of Saharan desert from the way its moving. Still going way too hard for normal society.


I attempted origami, found myself too shakey and gave up. Tried to amuse ourselves, smoked a lot of weed in the 8 hours that followed.  Long 8 hours of coming down, folded some paper cranes and glued them to a dead bonsai tree. Sleep didn't come for around +36h from initial dose.


The entire experience was really unpleasant, like the sort of unpleasant that makes stabbing myself in the hand more appealing than another DOB overdose.

Yes, haldol, quietiapine, or risperidone. You should also have some kind of benzo available.


Make sure you have one of those three anti-psychotics (I recommend the risperidone highly) before you get heavy into the long acting psychs. You will be so glad you did when the time comes to stop a terrible trip at hour 6 vs riding it out for 2 days.

Yeah, I enjoyed DOC when I tried it, but I could have done without the last five hours or so. 


Going to see if I can get my hands on any of those anti-psychotics or a benzo...

When I go outside, I actually almost feel high again, even though I am definitely not (most of my trip was done outside, and the whole world just seems more beautiful now). But I can't say what it will be like two weeks after taking it...well because I'm probably going to be doing it at least that often ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif) (probably never more than once a week, though)

SWIM knows this is 5 years later.....but as SWIM just got some DOC from a trusted source, your experience resonates exactly with what SWIM is looking to achieve.

SWIM is not interested in psychedelics to get 'high' and see 'cool stuff' - SWIM has been contemplating his existence and purpose and has been finding difficulty in reaching a sense of being happy and content in each moment.  The 'noise-machine' in SWIM's head seems to always want to gravitate backwards towards futile thoughts of past and present, both of which are not here and now.


Hopefully you are still on this forum and that you have some interesting insights 5 years later.....

Perhaps I should have added that I've ruled out many of the other substances as they turned out to be shallow and predictable, or just out of control and unrealistic.

That's why swim was interested in DOC?

SWIM had an on-off relationship with LSD in his earlier years back in the early 1990's.

Eventually SWIM decided that LSD was not something that felt good, was associated with too many bad trips, paranoia and negative memories and the after effects were not worth the time investment.

SWIM has heard that DOC can last a very long time but is more clearheaded than LSD in nature?  From reading reviews SWIM has the feeling that DOC may offer a more neutral playing field to work through the experience.

I didn't notice at first because you used it so little but to let you in on a super secret....we know its you and so would the police. No swimming allowed in this forum's pool! Benzos don't abort trips they just calm down overactive and over zealous minds or knock you out dependent of the benzo.

Looks like we are approaching the time of a new Big and Dandy DOC thread...


In other news, my local park has a phenomenal view across the south of Leeds, can see for quite a number of miles. May be my next venue for trialling DOC...

I know that it's advised one waits two weeks in between DOC trips, but what would my tolerance be like if I take 2mgs and then something like 7mgs this weekend?


Also, I'm going to sound mad for saying this since the duration is so long already, but would re-dosing during the trip lengthen it?

are you saying 2mg today and then 7mg this weekend?  your weekend trip will still be reasonably strong, might feel more like 5mg-6mg though.


and redosing does indeed increase the duration of the trip, sorry haha ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Yeap! 7mgs would be this weekend. Thanks for the input, I might even bump up my dosage a little bit then. 


I actually am considering redosing to lengthen the trip-- this weekend my friend is visiting and we're going to take DOC, and we have a tooooon of time, so perhaps we'll just trip for two days! But probably not, considering how insane that sounds.

How did you take it? Orally? DOC is one crazy ass chemical - insufflation is pure psychedelic pandemonium at 2mg! Couldn't imagine insufflating 7mg of DOC... ...or could I? ![8o](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eek.gif)

2-3mg insufflated will definitely provide that - near immediate onset and a very strong and complex trip (fairly visual, but very mentally complex), verging on a ++++. Be very careful though, I had a few difficult moments which required me to try to think myself out of them (I was under a lot of stress though, and I think this had quite some impact on the nature of the trip - felt very manic at times).

Orally all the way. Dissolved in a drink, and drank over the course of 30-45 min. 

Last time I just licked it off my finger and washed it down with some soda, which was an awful choice. Made me off and on nauseous for the entire trip. This time, I vomited an hour or so after taking it, but it felt so good to do it. I wasn't nauseous at all afterwards for the rest of the trip. Plus, since I was already coming up when it happened, it wasn't awful, unlike puking from alcohol.


Oh, and I definitely say this was a ++++ trip, although at times it receded to a +++. Holy shit, I can't wait to do it again in the future at this dose. Or maybe a little higher?

I had pretty much left the psychedelics this time 2 years ago, I'd found my niche with MDMA & I was more than happy. Shrooms would be eaten on the odd occassion I had the opportunity but I wasnt into experimenting anymore...


Then the government banned Meph. I tried the stuff out, liked it (bit too much) & began searching for LSD like chemicals (2c's, tryptamines etc) & have been enjoying tripping regularly for about a year now.

DOC is by far the most facinating chemical & I am delighted to have discovered it!


I dunno much about aMT, but I believe it is in fact DOC that's the cadillac of psychedelics!

Lol IDK if your misquoting on purpose but its said the car in question is a Rolls Royce not a caddy!P.S. A drug with a 3 hour come up and up to 24 hour extremely powerful mental/visual trip would not be a suitable choice for this phrasing IMO.

I'm talking about something different. Not the exclamation of something like "I love psychedelics!"aloud, maybe you do and think you do at that point, but from the sounds of it you had a trip that unlocks the exclamation of it in your heart that screams "God I fucking love psychedelics and the state they cause!!!".

aMT and DOC... One can only wonder what this combination would be like... I'd imagine the full range of virtually anything could be experienced on this combination. Feels like it could be near the ultimate psychedelic experience.


Well in the interest of science and all that, and the mere fundamental paradigm of curiosity killing cats, and envelope pushing, I think this may well have to be tested soon... Maybe with a bit of Ketamine thrown in if I'm feeling brave enough (or stupid perhaps...)... Crazy times for sure! Has anyone else combined these two (+ possibly third...) lovely chemicals? Did it end badly? Was it as promising as my imagination thinks it might be? 


I'd be separating the peaks slightly (by say 3-4 hours just in-case of MAOI effects), and going fairly careful on the doses of each. Something tells me this will be intense. Boredom and Intrigue - a dangerous mix...


I'd say DOC more resembles a maglev-train, going through the Himalayas - smooth, but at the same time, completely batshit-insane!

I would imagine AMT+DOC would feel like insane ecstasy on the body mixed with probably a lot of muscle tension and body load.


And yeah DOC definitely would be the rolls royce. AMT really isn't that good. Feels and trips like dirty dirty LSD mixed with a speedy E pill.

Oh aMT is really that good. My favourite chemical at the moment - even nicer than MDMA (which I love immensely). DOC would add some almost unimaginable layers of intensity to the aMT's warm lovelyness...

Another lovely DOC trip yesterday. The come down is a real bitch though. Couldn't sleep until at least 20 hours in, and then I only slept on and off for a few hours. But, the experience itself makes it all worth it. I can't believe the visuals that I have been getting with this compound. Unfortunately, my trip mates don't see the visuals in nearly the intensity that I have. I wonder why this is.

Visualization isn't exclusive to psychedelic experience. I truly believe some are just more prone to these effects than others, I have friends who get nearly zero visual disturbances at all from LSD. 2C-B has made this lesson all the more clear to me; psychedelic visuals are as much an effect of the drug as they are an exercise of your own mind. I can manipulate my 2C-B visuals as much as I want to.. You probably just engage yourself in the visuals more than your friends.

Had another 5-6 mg yesterday of this, a few hours after taking aMT, and was quite disappointed this time - the DOC didn't seem to take off really - the trip was weak. Hovever, introduced 2 good doses of Ketamine (around 50-60mg of K insufflated - have a pretty low tolerance to K), twice, and this lead to an extremely intense, visual trip with very impressive CEV's. Wow! That was crazy, the two go together very well.

How long ago did you dose the DOC? I find at least 2 weeks before tolerance returns to normal.

Oh weeks ago now, probably approaching 2 months ago now. I doubt tolerance was an issue.


I find DOC has a hideous comedown, on a par with high, repeated dosed MDMA. This doesn't seem unreasonable given that the euphoria from it equals peak level of what I might obtain from an optimal dose of MDMA, its just (generally) trippy-as-fuck to go with it. The next few days though, wow! A very worthy chemical but the comedown is a bitch! Be prepared for that! Still want more though, I guess the workaround here is to avoid concomittant use of putative 5HT agonists in conjunction with DOC.

The comedown is really shitty. As I wind down the trip, I find myself really sore (especially my back/shoulders/neck area) and exhausted, but of course still stimmed up for a while. And then for the next few days, I can't seem to get good sleep, and my legs feel weird and sore. But it's worth it every now and then for an awesome DOC trip.

sometimes i find on DOC that i forget to eat and drink an adequate amount.  i think this is often to blame for the body malaise that can occur.

Its more the emotional aspect of the comedown of DOC that sucks. I just let the drugs effects fade away, though I really like DOC's effects so never really want them to end (even after 24 hours!).

Weird, I get a pretty standard comedown on DOC aside from the muscle tension, and it's not as if DOC depletes serotonin levels or anything

I don't experience any negative effects during the comedown from DOC, rather the opposite actually. The afterglow from a DOC experience is one of the best. However, I agree that the euphoric empathy during the DOC experience is amazing, and actually - in my experience - blows the euphoria from MDMA out of the water.

But, the experience itself makes it all worth it. I can't believe the visuals that I have been getting with this compound. Unfortunately, my trip mates don't see the visuals in nearly the intensity that I have. I wonder why this is.

It usually takes me about 24 hours to sleep after dosing DOC. I have used diazepam once to get to sleep after being kept awake by hypnic jerks even at 24 hours. It's more a case that your body is so relaxed and ready for sleep, but your mind is still pumping. Still, it's not an agressive insomnia and I find the sleep following a DOC session to be so deep and refreshing.


The visuals are immense indeed, the CEVs take me to another world. They are also incredibly meaningful in a very cosmic way. Highly colourful, spectacular resolution and detail. The fractals go on forever. I can get lost in the mental/visual landscape for hours on DOC, it is that absorbing.

That's probably my problem, as I'm turned off by all food while tripping for basically the entire duration.

yup i do the same thing if i don't pay attention... pretty sure that not eating and staying away for 24 hours makes you feel like shit whether you're on DOC or not lol ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I think you have quite a point there ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png) Anyway, quick question. I want to go out with a bang this year and I think DOC is a proper igniter. I have skimmed trough this thread and have read about people taking this at concerts and watching fireworks. But is it still pleasant when you have fireworks going off around you? Because that is kind of how the streets are in the Netherlands on January 1st at 0:01. I can imagine that (professional) fireworks are amazing while on DOC, but I have my doubts about the little 16-year old punks throwing 100s of firecrackers around.
