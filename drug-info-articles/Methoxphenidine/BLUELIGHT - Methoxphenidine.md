Durations of ~12-18 hours have been reported, and dosing higher or redosing may lead to significant increase in this duration. Before taking this drug, consider this and make sure you have nothing to do for the day(s) to come!

> 
> - **Stomach contents**: methoxphenidine has shown a tendency to be metabolized very slowly and can greatly intoxicate someone who has not eaten properly while the same amount dosed on a full stomach may not hit as hard. It appears to be very fat-soluble, so it may get stuck in/to fatty food in your stomach or fatty tissues in your body before being released more slowly.

Things get very very crazy at 110mg, and watch you alcohol consumption.  Stick to a beer or two, no more.  It's definitely a fascinating compound though.  Just be careful people, it's a hell of a trip at the right dosage.  Don't eyeball, get some sensitive scales.  I recommend these:

I have done MXP many times and the effects always started to kick in around 45 minutes, peaking within 1.5 hours.  Please disregard my '1 hour' resdose time as it obviously affects people in drastically different ways.  I would still suggest suggest sticking to more that 110 mg per night though, total.  Perhaps this is due in part to the different vendor's suppliers, ie, the composition of the substance.

I'm not ever trying to 'hole' or trip into the weird disassociated realm, I prefer to waltz around just sub-hypomania where you get some energy and motivation as well as notice the mild anti-depressant actions but without the pure mania this class of drugs can produce. Also taking it at these threshold doses allow you to not fuck up your sleep as NMDA antagonists are prone to do. Also, if you take these lower doses this class of drugs is a lot safer to mess with, I've never gotten close to the amnesia these things can produce, never blacked out. I have redosed but my redoses are always lower, and a lot of the time not even necessary.

Come-up was rather swift, and I got excited about it in a good way. Took a walk to local tavern, where I know everyone. I was very chatty, with a big smile on my face. I've been sober two years (chronic alcoholic for 20), so didn't drink. Loved being around people, and was pretty bummed out when I was home alone again. I think that setting, mood, mindset is huge with this stuff. I'm sure everyone reacts differently at diff times, but I have some serious social anxiety issues, so it was interesting that I loved the socializing. Higher doses probably wouldn't produce that same effect, IMHO. A little fuzzy 12 hours later. Good experience. Will try again.   BTW, there was a time when I used insane amounts of DXM on an almost daily basis. Didn't find MXP very similar to that.

There are a handful of people who claimed to have had some luck vaping methoxphenidine. I'm curious if vaporizing/smoking MXP HCl is effective (and/or if smoking the freebase might be?)


This ROA is valid and can lead to dangerous chronic redosing with diphenidine. 


update: vaping mxp does not seem worthwhile vs diph. No effects whatsoever. YMMV. Likely due to tolerance/vendors/purity/other factors.

Holy shit, I holed on this stuff last night. It was beautiful - profound as MXE a few years ago. I don't know how safe it is but I almost always have a few beers and cannabis when holing on dissociatives, it adds a lot to the experience. I dosed 80mg first and a few hours later 60mg more. Come up is so slow with this that it's hard to get it right, redosing isnt that good with MXP. It took almost 3 hours since the redose. Next time I'll take 100-130mg all at once. 


I was horrified at first, thought I poisoned myself or something before it turned to very strong euphoria. Maybe the alcohol made me little nauseous or something. I rate dissociative holes more euphoric than MDMA easily. I cried a little too. It was more lucid than MXE, I didn't leave my body or anything, maybe higher doses will give OBEs. I'm just scared to up the dose with this since I've read so many hospitalizations with MXP.

Hospitalizations? From dissociative delirium / amnesia / fugue state type stuff, or health problems?


Felt poisoned as in: very nauseous and sick like when you have taken too much alcohol + K ?


I tried diphenidine once and didn't appreciate it, have acquired 500 mg of this at some point but I am kinda suspicious about all these Xphenidines

Erowid says: "There have been several deaths associated with its use."


I've read from other forums that people have had seizures from it too etc.


Yeah little nauseous and typical fear and anxiety doing unknown research chemical and typical dissociative mindfuck state when you just have to let go.

I just had my first experience with this today.

Took 85mg oral on an empty stomach. It was a very very subtle comeup, it wasn't until I realized that I had randomly walked all the way down to a lake to sit down to realize how dissociated I was.

Music was very interesting, I've read this is supposed to have music enhancement - only felt like music was becoming less complex and quicker.


I ended up walking a mile to a friend's house to hang out and smoke...one rip off of a bong...which put me into an incredibly euphoric (and, I think, slightly manic) state, where music became more beautiful than I have ever heard it on a dissociation. Dancing felt amazing.


About 8 hours later I insuff'd 40mg and smoked a bowl and it put me into a quite similar state as before.


I love this!

Can anybody reccomend an oral dose for a euphoric, stimulating and completely non-dissociated effect?


At what dose roughly does the dissociative weirdness take hold?

~50-80mg. Over 80mg and you start to get fucked up. I wouldn't take under 100mg now after a few trials though.

What about impairment? Of behavior / cognition / other functioning?


At what kind of doses should one expect what kind of impairments - am I correct to assume that impairment of all of those ^ functions is part of the territory, or is there a dose range like that 50-80 mg where you are dissociated but composed.

I feel that dissociative high is pretty much impairment no matter what dose you take, it makes me retarded in a way. I have this feeling that every time I do dissociatives, the whole night is kinda "crossed over" - I might as well make the best of it and aim for the hole. This is how every night usually ends when I take dissociatives, I redose until I'm holing even when it wasn't my primary goal. Some people seem to enjoy taking low doses and be functional but I don't use them that way and see little to no benefits with dosing like that. Well I've done lower doses on social situations or a festival settings and its lots of fun sure, but when I'm alone - hole is where the magic happens and what the hype is all about imo. Holes are comparable to high dose life changing psychedelic trips for me. They put things in perspective and they make me appreciate life more.


With MXP I don't get very much from dosing low, I enjoyed ~20mg (is that even low? I don't know, it was plenty in the beginning) MXE doses a lot though. But they almost always ended up me holing my ass off.

I would love to hole again. But i flushed my mxe stash two years ago :/


I'm on medication atm so it wouldnt be an Option anyway but knowing i'll never be able to do mxe again is frustrating.


And I dont want to try the new arylcyclohexylamins.


Maybe i can aquire some ketamine someday.

The only dissos ive tried r mxp,dpd,epd and 3meo-pcmo. Mxp seemed to produce the warmest most enjoyable effects compared to others. Dpd felt similar to me but somehow scarier and not as pleasant. Trying epd was a mistake. Nothing pleasant really and at least a day long vertigo like feeling afterglow.  3meo-pcmo made me freak out and have demonic nightmares for for like 8hrs.  But mxp was the first one i tried and loved. No point insufflating, just wasting it, tried vaping off foil with no effects either. But an oral dose of 80-120mg crystals crushed to powder and flushed down with water or anything really on empty stomack gives a very pleasant and warm buzz which takes a while to kick in. I have taken about 125mg orally around 4h ago with hardly any tolerance, (last time took any was maybe 3 months ago), i feel cossy and warm watching austin powers now in my bed under warm duvet. I can feel everything buzzing around, as if evrrythings vibrating including me. I cant wait to read this when it wears off cuz my mind is not working properly and i have no idea why and what am i doing now. Sry if its too long and boring but its my first kind if  trip report or an attempt to describe how i feel. What do u guys think a joint of 5f-pb-22 incense add to mxp high?

Happy new year! My 1g shipment of MXP arrived a few days ago and I've tested it out today. I don't have a scale so I'm being a bit irresponsible by dosing, but I'm trying to figure out why I'm not feeling anything. I parachuted two dime-sized piles about four hours ago, on mostly empty stomach, and I ingested a larger pile sublingually over two hours ago. Still feeling absolutely nothing except hiccups. Visually, it looks like about a quarter of the material is gone, although I'm aware that's very unreliable.


Is there any cross-tolerance with DXM? On new year's eve, I tripped 1032 mg of DXM (with 1/2 tab of LSD). It's only been a day or so; has anyone reported DXM use diminishing MXP effects? 


I also did a 2016mg DXM trip to celebrate the new year about two weeks ago, so I'm going to ease back on the DXM for the time being.

Hi, happy new year and welcome here ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


Don't use MXP without a scale, honestly.. if you read about diphenidine and analogues enough you have to conclude the massive risks involved with inaccurate / impatient use of these compounds.


Yes there is almost certainly cross-tolerance with other NMDA antagonist dissociatives like DXM, but it doesn't seem to work the same as with psychedelic tolerance. With dissociatives on the short term tolerance doesn't necessarily tend to abolish activity so quickly, while on the long term it can really stick around.


But it's possible this explains lack of effect.


I would be really careful to conclude anything from this and proceed based on faulty conclusions! Because if the dose-response curve is unforgiving and especially with your eyeballing you'd get yourself into a stronger reaction than you planned on, your behavior could become quite troublesome.


People have fucked up major things in their lives because of overdosing on novel dissociatives, so arrange every measure you can to avoid something like that from happening.

About a week ago I recieved less than 500mgs and managed to blow it all in two nights, with DXM brought in later. The first night I insuffed 80mg and only felt slight stimulation so I followed up an hour later with 80 oral and 30 oral two hours after that, with ~100-150mg DXM drinken after 5 hours total. The first doses threw me into a hole and since it was my first, it was slightly unnerving but fun overall. I had to go out like that to the bank and gas station (NOT driving) which was an adventure and a half, confusing but enlightening? The next night I took the rest of my bag in two oral doses, which was less extreme of course and followed up with 50 to 100mg DXM. I stayed up all both nights, and took too much DPH to sleep the following day but not enough for hallucinations. From there on sleep deprivation was probably messing with me but I managed to get naps the following days. (As you can probably tell, I'm still trying to piece the whole experience together. A few days ago I was NOT be able to remember what days these were). Over all, music appreciation, a complete lack of anxiety (minus the DPH), pure happiness makes this a positive experience for me. If I smoke a cig or get too warm/sweat, I can still feel hightened afterglow effects momentarily. However for my safety, next time I won't be dosing this high/redosing. I can't stand feeling like I've messed my brain up forever. Stay safe.

There is nothing you can do, besides eat healthy, drink lots of water and isotonic drinks, sleep enough and maybe excercise.

Yeah I thought so, that's why I edited my post. It comes and goes in waves and I just have to ride it out, which I don't mind. I just happened to get sick recently which is making it feel harsh at times, but it's still fine.

Glad to hear you´re fine. You will recover for sure, just give it a few days. MXP can last a very long time, especially if you dose high, redose and/or take it a few days in a row. All the best for you ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I have researched a gram of this stuff and I have to say it is a great dissociative. It's very similar to DXM but without the complete lose of balance and high dose. 130-150mg is just right for me to be pleasantly dissociated. It doesn't take hold of you as much as DXM or Ketamine, which is nice because it let's you think about and at least attempt to do things if you really need to. I plan on getting some more in the next couple of months.


My friend described it like "a high in the same place, but not the same as DXM"

I fucking absolutely love this drug. Towards the end of the last thread I mentioned that I was yet another person to botch a gram via attempted insufflation. It worked, but it wasted the majority of the methoxphenidine.


I'm yet to be anywhere near dissociated, but I've taken about 40-42mg today and found that to produce similar results to what must have been 100mg~ ish insufflated. I'd assumed that the only reason it was so good last time was because I had a benzo earlier in the day. Now I know it's just straight up methoxphenidine.


It alleviates depression and leaves me in a very clear headed, ever so slightly euphoric, very switched on state of mind. I feel like socialising and I'm having a mix for the first time in about six months.


I'm going to take it very easy with this stuff, but I'm definitely going to be using it (vary sparingly) as a substance to get me back on track. 


For some reason I've been avoiding the dissociative analogues, and I've got no idea why, given that I love dissociatives. 


I take it that the effects that I am receiving are roughly why many people loved low dose MXE so much.


Are there any other dissociatives worth trying which produce similar effects to the stimulating, motivating, focused euphoria of a low dose of this stuff?


For reference, I took it at at 3pm, it is now 22:22pm, and I still fell just as good.

Just looking at the chemical structure it seems that these xphenidines are perhaps a little too lipophilic (fatloving) to snort, compared to arylcyclohexylamines they might lack enough polar groups to compensate for the aromatic groups. Good water solubility is crucial for making snorting useful.


How limited is water solubility by the way? I wonder how RobotRipping IMed 1000 mg (saw that in the TR forum), how was that dissolved anyway? Must have taken a good volume of water??

It works, there are just two things to consider.


1. If you don't crush it up really fine, small chunks will get lodged up your nose. I'd imagine this is because they aren't soluble in water. It's very uncomfortable, and very hard to shift them. They just kind of sit there.


2. It's a highly ineffective method of administration, so you've got to to sniff roughly 3-4 times as much (in my experience, for a baseline dose. Please don't take my word on this).


What are peoples thoughts on taking low doses of a dissociative for depression? Does it often end well? This is far more effective for fatigue and depression than anything else I've taken.

Yesterday i took about 100-200mgish orally cuz i have  a spiked drink bottle in my room and it made me ocd like, i was cleaning my room for hours, doing some small jobs like filling gaps with filler, moving furniture, sanding rough parts of walls and stuff, made a sketch of how i would like to arange the furniture in my room, basically was veryy creative and with loads of energy to work. I love it at low doses but i have high tolerance. It really makes me productive and gives such ideas i wouldnt think of while sober. It really is a lovely drug at low doses. Im on roughly 100mg now and having a really nice chillin evenin with friends. Altho i have had horror storrys too

I think when drugs have multiple effects, like action on NMDAr for dissociation, but also monoaminergic action causing stimulation and mania... it's possible or rather very likely that you build up tolerance for the dissociative effects, but not really for the stimulation effects.


This is I think an important realization, that explains and affects what habitual users experience.


DRI's like methylphenidate are known to cause little or slow tolerance, so it is not crazy to suppose that if you grow tolerant to the dissociation the effect of drugs like these becomes more stimulating or anti-depressant, or what BathSalts described ^ as ocd like..

One of my worst experiences with mxp was... Well i dont recall much really. I had a fresh batch of 3g. I weighted out about 250-300mg as i was going for a hole and ws feelin like why not, crushed the crystals, put it in a glass of coke or something and chuged it. Fo first 2 hours i thought it wasnt active at all. Then i felt the buzzing sound/feeling thru my body. At that point i realised i might get shitfaced so tried to watch a movie and sleep. Turned on some comedy, smoked a pre rolled earlier joint of 5f-pb-22 i think and laid down in my bed relaxing. The next thing i remember was crawling downstairs for a cig like 12h later not being able to understand where i am, who i m, wht year it is or what is a cigarete. According to witneses that cig took me over 2h, i ws like crawling on the concrete in the garden at 2am in my bathrobe trying to realise what realm i am in. Also from witnesess i heard that after that i came back to my bed and was laughing uncontrolably for an hr or so. Then i went on a very beutiful dream of what i believe could be one of the posible afterlifes. Woke up god know when, smoked another joint of forementioned noid and went back to a beautiful dream of what i believe was one of the worlds we will go to after death. Woke up again hours later went for normal cig while coming back to reality feeling fucked up like never before. After that cig took 6-8mg diclaz cuz at that time i though it might help me at least to come off the binge. And it did. Slep for only few hrs tho, woke up still disso fucked up badly. Turned out it all lasted over 2 days and i had only 900mg of my 3g mxp left. Afterglow lingered for 36h+. To sum up dont do reckless like me, hide your stash after initial dose and never dose over 200mg even if u think u got tolerance. Mxp can give a very beautiful experience at lo to moderate doses, but if u dose rekless and/or redose, it is one HELL OF A DRUG. Stay safe out the bluelighters.

Wonder why there's a resurgence in interest in MXP? Or perhaps, I wonder why there wasn't more interest from the beginning.


My trials were pretty universally positive at typically (if I remember correctly) 60mg oral.


Then again, I did finally dump my stash? Why I can't remember the exact reason, but I obviously finally felt it "had" me. I was dosing when I should have avoided had rational prevailed.


My fondest memories of MXP are actually in the comedown, laying in bed, and getting taken for a ride on the source vibration. Felt like massage medicine for the brain.


Considering acquiring more and making another try one of these days.

I'm assuming the resurgence in interest with MXP has mostly to do with the China ban making MXE harder to source for some. I've finally found pretty good quality MXE again so I haven't gotten around to trying any of the new dissociative analogues beside MXE. This thread does make MXP sound worth a spin though, how much worse is the amnesiac effect from this compared to MXE? I hate never being able to remember my experiences with dissociatives... If I could source 3-MeO-PCP in quantities less than 1g-5g that would be amazing, sadly I haven't been able to. xx-phenidines sound so sketch compared to MXE & even 3-MeO-PCP when I read about them, so many people report blacking out and eating they're whole stash with the phenidines it seems. Anyway, im just ranting now. End

What sort of effects did you experience at 60mg orally? I'm still yet to experience dissociation on 44mg, and I'm weary about going much higher.


My personal reason for recently being interested (and having somewhat bumped this thread back), is because I had a hunch that this was a dissociative sold to friends as ketamine, around about this time one year ago. I tried snorting small amounts in a line, and experienced roughly similar effects to what I am now. However, that stuff seemed much more nasally active, and put a few of my friends in 6-8 hour dissociative holes, in which they had to be restrained. Is ephenidine nasally active?

Firstly I should say that I seem to be naturally tolerant to dissociatives and also I forget my doses (it was a while ago), so please ignore that number. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


That said, I don't go for holes or anything close to that. My use was, combined with pot, as a creativity enhancer. I did a lot of writing on this stuff. It felt stimulating too, which was useful (but annoying if you want to sleep).

I went through ~500mg of MXP in like 4 sessions or something and every time was positive. I doubt I will order it again though (got it for free as a bonus when ordering something else) because there are better dissociatives and it isn't too cheap here. It was nice and mellow at ~100mg doses, euphoric hole-ish when combining with weed and a few beers too but nothing extraordinary. Antidepressant effects were present the next day too so it was fun stuff to get for free. Can't compete with the one and only MXE though. I feel it's easier to go in and out of hole with this than MXE, don't know what happens when you take a high initial dose all at once.

I agree man. It just made my nose raw and gave me an awful drip that I just swallowed. It took almost as long to kick in and I assume it's because I had swallowed the drip and that's where all the mxp was.

I notice that this chemical produces effects that are identical to Diphenidine, but when the dose becomes more research appropriate(heavier) it will fluctuate and produce completely different sets of dissosiation. I bring this up because it also means that it's not a very reliable dissosiative and this it not how I feel this chemical should be branded as unreliable. Although I can not make an argument suggesting it is more than it has lead us to know of it because it requires such heavy dosages to get a feeling. From my experience it took me 300mg to define and understand it's dissociative state and although it was quite amazing and easy to take in I did not have more to say whatsoever.


To summarize, The general effect of MXP has undeniable similarities to Diphenidine, they can be hard to notice. When taking more of MXP the overall experience will become different and not just intensified. I don't want to say that MXP is not good but no proof on my part as of yet. I took 3 100mg cap within 20 minutes of eachother and only than could I understand anything about this fine chemical, I'm not a fan of taking multiple caps.

I'm getting 2 grams of this stuff through the post tomorrow. I was a Ket fiend for some years before bladder issues so having had a few years off have had some mixed reviews regarding all the post K dissos. 

My main gripe with pretty much all the newbies, including MXE is the lack of immediacy in terms of snorting the wham/bam K-Hole half gram lines. There seemed a certain safety in knowing you'd be K-holing in minutes whereas with these new dissos it's like a waiting game fraught with ambiguity. 

I certainly preferred high doses of 3 Meo-PCMO over diphenidine and uhh,, is it ephenidine(?) recently but they just tended to linger a little too much along the borderline retarded/psychotic states (in a fun challenging way nonetheless) than a full on hole. MXE similar though fair enough I'm interested in how this compares for stim / opiate like glows. Needless to say I do like these drugs to dump me into dissociatives holes rather than stimmy euphoric states I can find elsewhere so I aim to hole.

That said Ketamines all but dried up here so here's to the new contender. I'll start on 100mg MXP oral tomorrow and perhaps redose 50-100mg if I'm satisfied and comfortable doing so after 4 hours. 

I've been developing a minor Methadone habit of late (once or twice a week - friend bought) so it's good to have a few weeks off that but in all likelihood at some point I'll try an MXP / Methadone comedown combo. 

I'm more than happy to plug this stuff as a preferred ROA after initial oral dose due to the inconsistencies in full / empty stomach and the effects ebbing and flowing especially with a redose and will more than likely combine with NO2 and see how that works to. 

That said , I do know my way around these things and prefer to do them alone, phone off the hook, benzos on hand and would seriously advise anyone to read the entire threads on these RCs and work out your own harm reduction methods.

Anyway,, will let you know - peace


THE  DOH!!!! UPDATE - Whereby in classic dissociative blunder mode you think this is a new one to try then read further into past MXP threads and realise you have indeed done this before.. With dissapointing effects at low levels. Here were my initial thoughts - ON READING THIS BACK I'LL DEFINITELY NEED 200mg starter tomorrow


*Update - 125mg orally,, on fairly full stomach left me fairly unimpressed. 

I'd describe the physicals more like woozy-drunk than any of the more fun angular style of walking wonkily with gravity that K does. It has an interesting effect on the body coming up on it, more heavy than light though,, like you can feel its pull more like Salvia than Ketamine. That sucked as I'm no fan of Salvia.

MILDish dissociative feelings sure (3 outta 10 type. Could still go out and talk / score easily) but not even approaching what fun I got up to on K > MXE or 3 MEO-PCMO at much higher doses,,which I did very recently so this may have hindered initial try-outs to be fair.

This underwhelming experience is blatantly mostly a tolerance issue my end rather than the drugs subjective effects. 

But still for what it's worth it wasn't near anything as forgettably memorable as even a mid-MXE dose this time round. 

And the long onset / duration is so far from the snorting half a gram of K type BOOM onset/experience I for one prefer, so probably about as far from K as a dissociative gets for me thus far but I got more to play with.

Though just speaking for myself,, whilst I do over emphasise subjective elements to all this (for good reason especially with this substance) I'm actually a bit more likely to want some insane for a few hours dissociation like cr00k eloquently suggests than a more typical psychedelic experience.

On the positive (and actually it is surprisingly positive) I did wake up the following day with an alarmingly happy spring in my step for some weird reason so not all bad. I'm fairly sure I'll be able to handle around 200mgs next seeing as I could function in public on 125mgs even though,, yeah,, more of a clear headed but woozy effect on the body physically. Sloppy drunk rather than wonky robo-K walking. Hopefully I can plug this stuff to. Meh..


2nd report - OK, 2nd time round on this. Gummed (oral) a first 125, nastyish taste but went away / Ate a 2nd 125mg both around 10.5 now hours ago

Before even thinking how I'll end this report I've A) noticed it seems a far better anti-depressant than it is a hardcore dissociative and B) noticed that at least in public lends itself to an annoying slurry type of physical wooziness which is about as far from the fun I had 'back in the day' when I used to challenge myself to shadow-box having just snorted big lines of Ketamine,, which as a past-time used to be a super-fun challenge for the body,, physically. This stuff,, FOR ME, physically, certainly on a trial dose of 125mg is just nothing like that. Context is everything though,, I know. . 

So I've been on a 250mg dose for the past 10 hours,, 10 and a half whilst typing this and a bit of re-editing but probably most crucially to this report keeping very busy with an "art" project I have 2 weeks to submit - (Basically at this level for me it's still useful as a creative aid)


So tomorrow I'll start by adding 200mg to dissolve in boiling water, let it cool,, plug - then see how much I have to amp it up to get to the threshold levels just short of how crOok eloquently describes his heavier times on this.

Probably see if NO2 works well with it all as well. Sadly it just seems I have kept my tolerance for these kinds of drugs so don't try these dosages yourselves unless already very well versed. Be warned

Very nice drug, but the effects didn't peak until 4-5 hours after dosing. 130mg was too much for me and I'm experienced with dissociatives

An update on my short stint with this chemical. The doses were generally 40mg~, and via oral administration.


Day 1: Stay up until 2 in the morning playing on decks. Decide to offset sleeping by doing pushups. This is completely unlike me. Fatigue, depression and anxiety completely eliminated. A very euphoric day.

Day 2: Kind of like day 1, but not quite so good. Pretty euphoric.

Day 3: I can't possibly imagine getting anxiety, but I'm not sure I like it. Its kind of like my ability to feel emotion has been labotomised. Feel very neutral.

Day 4: I don't feel very good, and I don't like this any more. I feel like I could get anxious, but don't. It is incredibly cold and clinical. 

Day 5: I definitely do not like this, and I feel anxious, depressed and fatigued. Incredibly dysphoric.


I waited a week and took some more, and it was exactly like day 5. And so ends my experiment with MXP.


(Actually I'd quite like to try it again with a benzo, but I'd probably just sniff my way back through day five)

ive been wondering if this would be a good disso to try, for someone thats pretty new-ish to dissos and well experienced in psychedelics. but from observations it seems like this one reacts very different from person to person, more-so than most RCs

how would some of you compare this to 3-meo-pcp?

Mine too. I tried insufflating once, never again. It burnt quite a lot. IIRC after a few minutes it stopped hurting because the numbing effect took over. But it definitely felt like my mucosa was damaged.


Also, this compound makes me pretty introspective if left alone with my thoughts, and the resulting thoughts are often depressing in nature.

I always snorted it, due to the long come-up orally (2h vs. 45min. insufflated). But not more than 70mg. I agree, that the crystals are too big and not easily water-soluble. The drip does not completely fade away until the 30 min mark, and the crystals sting in the throat.


The main effects IMHO are not depressing, but melancholic. The difference is, that depression is self-destructive and melancholy is self-purging. You'll feel better than before taking the drug after the effects are over.

picked some of this up the other day and will be trying it on saturday, is there a difference in effect based on bodyweight? my usual drug squad has some fluctuations in the weight deparment, sometimes leaving my larger friend slightly dissapointed (often redosing) and the one/two thinner people pretty content, but occasionally monged with their first, and myself being the happy medium. I've seen some people saying that it is similar to DXM, but others saying the opposite. its the only dissociative i have previous experience with (i dose 750mg from time to time) however the others have had a few run ins with ketamine. The plan is to dose 60-80mg with a potential (if only 60mg taken) 30mg redose after an hour or so, none of us have a tolerence for dissociatives, does this seem like a reasonably sensible dose? With other things (MDAI is the best example) im much happier eyeballing doses due to the amount that needs to be taken, and the duration of the high, but for something that lasts potentially 12-18 hours that i have no prior experience with, im aiming to be quite conservative/carefull.

Mine was a fine powder. When dissolved in water it gives a white-ish solution.


I have a new batch now, from a new vendor. The come-up from oral  administration seems definitely longer (I'd say around 2h) than that of  the previous batch (around 1h - 1h30). It may also be because I ate  pizza 2h before. But I had been eating prior to oral administration with  the previous batch as well.


And yes, I agree with you, it is melancholic. Once I took it with  metocin. I ended up crying, feeling like I was surrounded by sadness and  being sadness myself. But it was definitely self-purging. No OEV's  though, whereas the MXE and metocin combo always give me the most  awesome visuals.

I would say yes, it is a reasonable dose.  The most I've taken in one session was 75 mg followed by a 75 mg redose  (with no tolerance, or maybe a slight one), and I was not extremely  dissociated. However, I can't definitely judge of the intensity of the  dissociation alone, because I was also on clonazolam (1500 ug, with a  slight tolerance), weed, and then one beer, followed by chewed salvia  (3.5 g) (I ended up falling alseep while chewing the salvia, sitting in  front of my computer, and waking up with my shirt full of brownish  drool).


When I take MXP at a party I take between 40 and 75 mg  (oral), in one dose (75 mg being the maximum, and 60 mg being the second  highest). At the 75 mg dose I did get the feeling of leaving my body when closing my eyes, also extreme melancholia, but it was around 6h after a 100 ug 1P-LSD dose.

This person should realize that nootropics have been known to counter effects of dissociatives. This isn't necessarily an exact science (yet), but it makes at least some neuropharmacological sense and has been suggested by at least several people.


So if you read this: be careful and readjust your dose if you suddenly stop taking nootropics with it.

Took 80mg MXP & vaporized some weed this morning at the office. Why? Because I hadn't touched MXP in a long long time and had never tried it during the office day.


Recent drug history: Low, spread-out doses of MXE on some weekends, to attempt to help with motivation/depression. I have a dissociative tolerance.


Setting: My office. Set: Have been overworked, but recently finished a project. Family life takes up all my non-work hours, and I'm chronically sleep deprived due to sick kid & baby. Not happy in my relationship. Trying to figure out how to be creative in my world. Love being a father.


Since my most recent work project was just completed, I gave myself a day to slow down and just clean up and organize the office. I think my favorite trips on any drugs often have me cleaning and/or organizing. Perhaps this is because it is something that I can do slowly, at whatever pace, and still feel like I'm being productive, combined with the fact that I can simultaneously listen to music and contemplate as desired.


I decided to listen to Leonard Cohen's last album (Popular Problems) which I hadn't yet listened to. Great choice. The first song on the album is called Slow. In the middle of the album one song ended and I thought, "that was a catchy tune, let me listen to that again." Second pass through the song I started crying like a little baby and could hardly stop. I have to agree with other posters who suggest that the nature of this one is melancholic. Perhaps I'm already a melancholic guy and that's why I like MXP at all.


Then again, I also took a walk and texted a friend, chatting about unfinished projects (we have had *many*) and feeling generally silly and giddy. After the walk, I wrote a poem: the first I have written in a few weeks. Felt good, easy, natural.


Overall, mild but healing. Hit the spot for me today.


This probably goes without saying, but I don't think dissociatives are good ideas when one has serious responsibilities; even if those responsibilities are normal family life, as in my case. I've never got to where I wanted to, with any dissociative, when real life is running the show (which is 99% of the time for me these days). Sometimes they seem to help, but I think, finally, they hurt if taken in the wrong context. At the right time and place, however, they can be wonderfully healing; even the supposedly least-interesting amongst them, like MXP.

A little history before my question, 

You would be hard pressed to find a drug I have not done, mostly I have done meth my whole life, illicitly from 15-36 by prescription from 36-47 (After an appropriate diagnosis of add/ADHD). I have. Tried most of the DOx series, the NBOME &  related series & every lysergimide & every other sub Rc u can think of. From this I have come to 2 conclusions:

1) you MUST respect all chemicals. The second you don't they will take you!

2) for every one of us, just as we all have unique fingerprints, bio-chemical electrical fields/auras, there is something, be it a single amino acid, branch chain AA, botanical or synthetic chemical, that will make us to as close to a perfect being as we can achieve.


I have found this in methoxyphenidine. I have take enough before to totally disaccociate myself from everything. I thought I was dead. While there is a part of me that found this experience benificial, it scared the hell out of me &  I never wish to experience this again. With that said I have found methoxyphenidine to be my 'perfect drug' (please excuse the cliche). Hence my question. At arround 50mg the effect it has on me is perfect. I am mor am more amicable, empathetic, happy. Understanding. At one with the universe.

So here's my question-  does anyone know of any long term health risks associated with low dose use of methoxyphenidine on a regular basis??

Thanx, 

        Me

Tested this out recently, got a gram to split with a friend. First go with it was drinking as well, felt mentally muddled but at peace with everything. Hard time communicating but the tranquility that settled on me made the experience worth while. Started off with a small bump to begin with, maybe around 50mg. Did 250mg that night total (weighed out what was left in the bag). It didn't seem like anything special, but the second time was one of the greatest, most calming and beautiful experiences I've had in a long time. Will post on the second experience in detail when I am able, planning on writing up a trip report. Wonderful chemical from what I've felt. Very recently my friend hung herself and this has been surprisingly helpful in putting life in perspective.

For the person above who was into Ket and had bladder issues, rest assured, both MXE and MXP can cause similar issues. I've seen it happen to people using a lot of it and I started having issues urinating, having odd sensations in my UT, and other such things that made me run from that shit like the plague. The problem with MXP is that the doses tend to be MUCH higher, into the hundreds of MGs once you get used to it, and so I think it affects the UT even that much more/sooner. I wasn't about to have my kidneys or bladder get fucking destroyed so as much as I loved MXE and like MXP, I stay far away from that stuff. Just wanted to throw that out for the person above who gave up K because of bladder issues.

Has anyone tried this with any tryptamines (like shrooms, lsd, 4-aco-dmt, etc)?  I tried digging through that 30 page thread but didn't really find anything about it.  Seems like it could be an interesting combo but I'm wondering if one or the other would overpower the other, and what doses would be appropriate etc.

I tried a little "test" of 4-aco-dmt combined with MXP.  I took 12mg of 4-aco-dmt (my normal dose is 30mg) at 2PM, and since the peak usually lasts about 5 hours I tried to time it so I'd have roughly an hour left at the peak when the MXP took effect.  The 4-aco-dmt trip was pretty tame by my standards, as would be expected with such a low dose.  Still felt pretty good and "at one" with the world, and some minor visual distortions but nothing groundbreaking.


At 4PM I took 150mg of MXP which is my normal dose.  Up until about 5:30 I basically didn't feel the MXP at all (which is normal for me), but the 4-aco-dmt was still at the peak.  Over the next half hour the MXP gradually took effect and created some pretty intense euphoria to the point where I was laughing with joy.  The MXP seemed to smooth out all the "rough edges" of the tryptamine feeling while leaving all the good feelings.  The visuals were pretty crazy at this point too.  Everything was making huge ripples/waves like water to the point I was almost convinced I could just go swimming in it.  Instead of leaving me in a "void" like MXP usually does I was much more alert and active.  I had so many ideas of things to do (play piano, dance/move around, go outside, draw/paint something, etc) but it was hard to stay focused on any one thing.  I kept getting stuck in thought loops as well, even repeating the same actions over and over (I knew it was happening but somehow couldn't stop).  At one point in the trip I remember wondering if I was a malfunctioning android/robot of some kind or part of a computer simulation that was broken, and it seems silly now but I'm pretty sure I even repeated MALFUNCTION a few times...possibly influenced by the spacey sci-fi ambient music I had playing most of the trip.  Again it seems pretty silly now but I really believed it at the time.  It's hard to say when but at some point the trip became more of a normal MXP trip (probably because the 4-aco-dmt was wearing off as I had planned).  More in a void of nothingness and tranquility which is more how MXP normally effects me, and as it wore off some deep introspection.  In particular I made the decision to try to lose the 25-30lbs of fat I have picked up over the winter.  It just seemed so ridiculous that I had even gained that weight in the first place just because "stuff tastes good".  That was about a week ago and I've already lost 5lbs.  ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


All in all it was a pretty crazy experience.  I haven't had a trip quite that surprising and special in awhile, probably because I have become too familiar with tryptamines, phenylethylamines, and dissociatives by themselves over the last 15 years (probably at least 100 trips with each class of drugs).  I've only combined "serious" psychedelics a couple times before (MDMA + shrooms) and usually would just combine them with weed and maybe some opiates/benzos for the comedown.  I'm glad I started with such a low dose of 4-aco-dmt and spaced them so far apart.  At a higher dose lasting for many hours I'm not sure what would have happened or what I would have done (I'm not someone who does daft/dangerous things or redoses even on heavy doses of psychedelics, but even so I could see it happening combined large doses of these 2 drugs).  I don't think I've ever felt so "out of my mind" yet still been so conscious/active and able to remember so much about it, almost like someone else's memories had been put in my head or an alternate personality of some kind.  I've had some serious high dose ketamine and dxm experiences where I was pretty sure I had died, ascended to another dimension, etc but in those cases I only actually remembered brief moments from those trips.  This one it feels like I remember most of what happened.  It's just hard to actually make sense of it and that it was me who experienced it.

I know there have been studies with ketamine that have shown it has some value as an anti-depressant and for helping people cope with chronic pain.  However, most dissociatives seem to have some pretty serious physical side effects when used on a regular basis so in most cases I think the long term side effects would outweigh the benefits of using them therapeutically.


Like most "trips" there is the potential for insights you wouldn't have had otherwise, so from that perspective they can be beneficial when used occasionally.  Dissociatives tend to destroy your ego at high doses which can offer a valuable/unique perspective on things that your ego normally wouldn't allow you to consider.  They can also make some people do some pretty stupid/crazy things though, especially if you are the type of person who tends to redose in the middle of a trip (when your judgement is not great).

In a trip report 80-85mg Methoxphenidine supposed to be about similar potency to ~110-115mg Diphenidine and that supposed to be maybe  best dose maybe for someone with no tolerance idk


In another  trip report I read on here one guy did 120 mg and went to jail after calling the police or something on himself, like thinking he was in a dream and didnt matter what he did 


that's the kind of stories that scare me

Do not snort this stuff.


I did the worst thing and eyeballed a fairly large bump. I'm experiencing very minimal dissociation, but maximal nose burning. It must be like an hour now and my nostril is still very uncomfortable. The sensation is even radiating out as far as my eyebrow/temple. 


I immediately weighed out the rest into 100mg capsules.

Seems like it could be an interesting combo but I'm wondering if one or the other would overpower the other, and what doses would be appropriate etc.

I did a combo of allylescaline, 1P-LSD, AL-LAD, MXE, MXP, 4-HO-MET and 2C-D (all in reasonable doses). It was my best trip ever. Roughly, first half was allylescaline, 1P-LSD, AL-LAD, MXP and MXE. When the MXE hit me, I was on my road to the beach, there were energy lines connecting everything, the visuals were astounding. I went to lie down on the beach, I became one with it, I could see my mind fragmented, projected and rotating into the gleaming nightsky. I also felt reborn. It was like I was experiencing something divine, a pure bliss, a glimpse of beauty in its pure state. Second half was the intake of 4-HO-MET and 2C-D. Inside the house this time. This part was still extremely rich in hallucinations.


Also I've tried MXP + 4-HO-MET + 2C-D, also 1P-LSD + MXP. But the synergy has nothing to see with the one you get by mixing psychedelics with MXE. Much less visual. Still interesting though. Maybe I haven't pushed the MXP dose enough.

Any people here with massive dissociative tolerance, and does MXP has any reasonable effect for you? Or do you have to dose so high that side-effects or long duration become a problem?

I could go through a gram of quality MXE in a day or two, in the form of IM injections of ~100mg (80-120mg usually, sometimes up to 150mg) in an interval of 1-2 hours with short breaks in between. I have long term tolerance and a desire for pretty extreme dissociation, though I abstain these days because I wish to pursue other interests in life. When I briefly experimented with MXP, I found that while I couldn't achieve that same level of dissociation as with MXE, I did get some much milder yet interesting novel effects. I can't remember exactly how high doses I was using, around 150-200mg maybe? 


I could easily feel it in my body so I knew it was affecting me, but I was often sceptical if it's doing anything. Then suddenly out of nowhere I would notice something extremely odd, like I put on a TV show and watched a new episode and was really puzzled because I was 100% convinced that everything was computer rendered, I asked my friend if the shows actors had quit or was this some kind of funky special episode or what on earth was going on? He was puzzled too, because it was just another episode with normal actors and tried to assure me nothing funky is going on. I couldn't believe it so I had to watch movies I had seen before and knew were actually shot in real life, but even they looked like pure CGI to me. Nothing else really felt altered, but this was a really profound visual effect to me.


It's like I would sometimes get these very specific and weird effects from MXP, sometimes nothing that I would notice except the body feel. I never had problems with coordination or movement either. Interesting experiment but it didn't leave me with the same desire to repeat it like ketamine or MXE which I would relentlessly consume dose after dose as soon as I was able to redose until there's nothing left.

I started doing dissociatives 17 years ago and something like 150mg gave me a cool hole experience.

I like this drug. If ephenidine feels like a low dose phenetheylamine, then MXP feels like a low dose tryptamine. I feel like insufflating is completely different to ingesting it; insufflating being preferable. It's good for adding a little flavor to your day, but not much more than that. It gives me a buzz and a bit of energy, with a mildly altered perception. Too much just causes a speech impediment for me. And it lasts a while.


Don't expect to be blown away, but if you fancy feeling a bit different and having a bit of energy then it's different.


*Also makes music sound crisp as fuck.

Comparing -phenidines to trypts or phens is not accurate at all IMHO. They all are cold, amnesic, dysphoric... They don't share a single point with any psychedelic beside both are drugs.

Solipsis, do you not find that your tolerance returns to baseline after an extended break? For me, it's more of an issue of tolerance rapidly rebuilding, though it may take me longer than others for my tolerance to fall again.


Dissos are really only worth it a handful of times a year for me at this point. 


Although, a lot of my tolerance issues came from trying to chase my first true IM ketamine exeperience, so I also tend to think that getting a true "full on" disso experience is only possible with extended breaks in between, even without an established tolerance.

I agree they aren't really similar in any way but I wouldn't call them dysphoric.  I have always loved dissociatives in general though, even the ones most people hate (like dxm).  I don't love them for a "wooo this feels great" feeling (that would be MDMA, heroin, cocaine, etc).  There is just something crazy, weird, otherworldly and magical about them that tickles my brain in the right way.  Of course everyone is different though, and I can see how many people wouldn't enjoy them.


I remember wanting to try LSD since the very first moment I heard about it (almost 20 years ago) and the funny thing is most dissociatives are closer to what I imagined an LSD trip would be like (and closer to how they are portrayed in movies, pop culture, etc) than LSD itself actually is.  I love LSD and other tryptamines too but for a totally different experience.  Above all else I just like to "mix it up" and try as many different things as possible but dissociatives do have a special place in my heart.

Yep my tolerance returns almost to baseline if I abstain from using them for awhile, although I doubt it will ever quite be the same as your first experience since now you sort of know what to expect.  MXP in particular has a very long lasting tolerance, so it's really one of the worst ones to do on a regular basis.  I've done it a full week apart and the effects of the 2nd dose were still diminished (and I even took a slightly higher dose to try to compensate).  It seems like about 2 weeks apart is the most often I can use MXP without any diminishing effects.


The only dissociatives I've ever "binged" on were ketamine and dxm and it seemed like the longer the binge the longer it takes to get back to baseline as well.  After my serious binging days it took a couple of years "break" where I only used them every few months before the magic was back.  Upping the dose only gets you so far.  Eventually I got to the point where taking 2-3x the dose that used to hole me was just "meh" so at that point I just took a break.  Plus taking high doses often probably can't be good for your health either.


Also for me weed has always had a very powerful synergistic quality when combined with any dissociative.  I always made it a point to smoke right before/after ketamine dosing and on the comeup for longer lasting stuff like dxm or mxp.

Is this one really worthwhile compared to the other dissos I mentioned? I can't really remember if this one has got his own magic, and I don't want to spend money on 5g's of something that will maybe disappoint me when I try it again.

Yep my normal dose for this stuff is actually 150mg+.  Below 100mg makes me feel a bit floaty, numb, and disconnected but nothing too amazing.  It can still be okay especially combined with some weed but it really takes higher doses for a more magical/weird experience.  Of course you should always start at low doses when trying a new substance though since they can affect people differently.


That's just my experience though.  Your mileage may vary. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

FWIW I have also tested my blood pressure and pulse on this drug the last couple times I did it and my pulse is about 70-80 (slightly higher than usual) and blood pressure 125-130/80-85 (also slightly higher than usual).  Of course everyone could react differently but it at least seems to be relatively okay on the heart/circulatory system for me.  I don't have a blood oxygen monitor to measure breathing though, and of course it could still do nasty things to your brain or other organs without necessarily showing up on BP/pulse monitors.

I tried using citric acid with this last night since I found a couple websites that said it can increase the effects and make the effects come on sooner, and WOW those rumors are definitely true...especially in regards to the comeup.  This stuff normally takes about 90mins before I really start feeling anything and doesn't peak until over 2 hours after dosing.


Last night I ate half an orange, then swallowed the powder with some water, then ate the other half of the orange.  In 45mins I was already feeling the effects and after only about an hour I was pretty much at the peak.  The effects were still largely the same but it felt a bit more powerful (almost as if I had already smoked weed with it when I hadn't) and it had a "cleaner" feeling to the trip.  It didn't seem to affect the duration of the experience either, just made the comeup twice as fast.  I will never take this stuff without a citric acid fruit ever again.

I have a somewhat relevant story to your citric acid comment. I'm on this diet right now where you consume foods that are so-called alkalinizing foods. Every day you pee on a pH strip and monitor your urine (and/or saliva pH) with a test strip. The goal is to get your urine pH above 7.0. After months of fairly radical changes in diet I managed to cut out enough acidifying foods and get my urine consistently above pH 7. This isn't a pitch for the diet (I feel really good since trying it though) but is an experiment I'm conducting. This diet starts out with a tall glass of lemon water every day. 


Point of my story is, after a single 100mg dose of MXP and no major diet changes, my urine pH stayed below 7 for a couple days. I attribute it to the MXP.

I disagree. I've experienced euphoria with these drugs, and dysphoria; same as with ketamine. Furthermore, we aren't completely certain which receptors they act on; for all we know they are having a similar action on the brain.


MXP is very grubby and grimy. I'm not saying tryptamines are; but I fucking love it.

Yeah a bit, but only for a short while before it comes back full swing.


I have considered arranging that I can IM my K because it's quickly losing its magic again... sure it still makes me feel 'gone' but besides that it is not really interesting enough anymore. I've ran out and should really minimize my drug use...


It appeals to me as it ever did, even if I mostly chase something with it that I cannot really get again. I don't really want to look for more potent dissociatives nearly as much.

Do you guys like to split doses with this stuff or dose all at once? I always stagger doses with dxm and definitely ketamine (I just take bumps until I get where I want to be) to avoid the weird body load I get when the effects come on all at once. If you stagger doses, how long do you like to wait between doses?

I wouldn't advise staggering the doses with this substance, redosing MXP has a tendency to result in blackouts and strange behaviour. I made this mistake a few days ago and redosed after taking 130mg orally earlier on in the night. I ended up feeling mildly disphoric, blacking out and was later found with an intense expression on my face pissing down the stairs which my friend found pretty hilarious.8)

This stuff has become one of my favorites over the past few months, it's definitely not something to mess around with though. 120 mgs dissolved in Gatorade makes me feel like I'm flying with my eyes closed, the sensations of movement you can create on this stuff gets profound, especially if you close out your visual reference points. I imagined I was a comet in one experience and had the sensations throughout my body that I would get on a high speed roller coaster...I have had hilarious times trying to get around my pitch dark room, I would lose track of where "up" was.... snorting it or blowing it up your nose (which I find more effective) can be quite unpredictable but I find myself trying it more often recently because of the intensity.... mixed with hdmp-28 or Molly it really adds to the party , Tryptamines get a little hectic though (lsd,4-aco-dmt,Moxy) but are fun for those in for the ride... that's my brief summary on map or hatter as we have started to call it among my colleagues

Note to whoever is interested: this stuff is, according to Wikipedia, being banned in Canada at the end of November. 

Alas...just began experimenting with this and find it preferable to MXE. Time for a large preban order ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

Has anyone tried DXM, ketamine, and maybe even 2f-ketamine (or dck which is supposedly very similar) and MXP? I've been sitting on a gram for months, it'd be my first venture into a "harder" dissociative, though I'm very experienced with the ones I have tried. I want more euphoria though, even slight manic feelings. Can anyone compare?

 MXP is not at all similar to ket, 2f-ket or 2-oxo-pcm. For me it was another dirty -phenidine without any magic. Like a more stimulating diphenidine, but still dysphoric and lackluster.

^ Well said. mixed with 3-meo-pcp, this can make a person hole more easily. I tried it twice and sorta liked the experience at first but it got weird on me the second time. I'd avoid this combo. 


This compound has the nickname "cold and clinical" for a reason, it really seems to make the hole meaningless and alien. I also had a gram which I finished recently. Not gonna buy again. It's a pretty good anesthetic I'd guess for acute pain cause I feel really numb on this one. My vibe-o-meter says avoid. It takes me to an empty, meaningless place. I use these substances for uplifting purposes and this one fails.

Thanks MSK and levels, are you just talking about holing doses or is it dysphoric and cold at lower doses too, or is it a nice body high? I've read a few reports that it had a warm, vibrating body high at lowish doses. Would you say that it's worth trying, since I already have some?

If someone could give me some insight troubleshooting an issue I've been experiencing with this compound I would be very much appreciative:


I've dosed three times in the last week, and, while I haven't noticed any overt acute tolerance, the duration has never been longer than a few hours?

All doses (70mg, 105mg, and 55mg, administered orally) were consumed on an empty stomach; almost totally empty in the case of the latter two, and having eaten two hours prior in the case of the former. First alerts around T+0:45, fully developed effects by T+1:30.

I was in a wonderful space for ~30-60 minutes each time (the degree of wonder being dose-dependent, with intense dissociation at 105mg), but effects tapered off quickly and I felt only slightly above baseline by T+3:00... for reference, I am almost invariably drug sensitive and find it very easy to discriminate and quantify drug states even with small doses of subtle compounds. Given the large warning re: duration on the first page of the megathread, I was anticipating something a little more long winded?


Theories:

Incorrect pH; going to consume an acidic beverage prior to ingestion, see if that lengthens clearance time.


Any other thoughts??


Additionally, anyone have experience administering this stuff intrarectally?

I found that 75mg orally (with 15mg oral THC and ~100mg indica cannabis inhaled over the duration of the experience) produced a warm, very enjoyable body high (perfect for watching movies) and a pleasant disconnect.

Didn't find it even remotely cold and clinical- /diphenidine/, I found cold and clinical. Ymmv, but I found this to be an enjoyable and forgiving compound (I first sampled it while suffering a bad cold, and it provided a high degree of comfort)

Thanks for the info! I usually titrate with dissociatives very carefully so I only want a mild buzz and dissociation to start off, don't really care about visuals. 


Would it be safe to try a threshold dose later today? 

I took just under 2mg clonazolam (I have a tolerance and this is actually a slight taper for me)

And 50mg adderall IR so far, might have a little more. 


Would serotonin syndrome even be a possibility or would blackouts be a possibility even though I'm on a moderate/lower than usual  dose of benzos? Also, I've always been really good with not compulsively redosing with RC's and I definitely don't think I'm disinhibited enough right now for that to be an issue. But just to be safe, I'll probably have my BF dose me and hide the stash.

Noooot. Of course it is not similar to the mentioned. But it is also not at all dyphoric. It is melancholic, helps incredibly with crying (letting it out) and cleansing IMHO.

I've been researching the psychoactive properties of legal diphenidine for about a week now and haven't yet layed eyes on any clear results about whether it is less harmful to snort or swallow this particular drug. Both options obviously slowly destroy your cells but is your digestive system more fit to fight it than your respiratory canals?


I'd like to add that so far I've only been researching one case in which the hole is described almost as an NDE, and the after effect (more than 24h after the last line) is that of an epiphany : continuous energy and motivation, depression gone, enhanced confidence, enhanced memory, enhanced musical sensibility, proprioception (dyspraxia almost gone), anxiety gone, healthier lifestyle in general (eat, drink, work out, communicate, clean better than ever)...


Hasn't been long enough for me to formulate any solid conclusions but i'll keep posting my research for those in need of more data

After trying a small test run dose of around 20 milligrams last night I have to say I actually quite enjoyed the effects of this disso. It seems underrated to me, and strikes me as a good niche dissociative. I didn't get much euphoria or magic from it, but combined with a nice indica this dose actually put me to sleep and had me feeling fuzzy and warm. I am sure the effects are much different in the higher dosage range, and would like to try at least 35-50 mgs next time. It also seems like a good dissociative to combine with another disso as a means of potentiation.

^I'd bet some good money that it will outlive you in those conditions; as far as I can tell from my experiences, tryptamines are the only substances to really fuss about when it comes to storage. I keep my lysergimides in room temp and I haven't seen any degradation at 2+ years time. Things like MXE, phenethylamines, etc. seem to have an amazing shelf life. I don't have any MXP myself but I'm sure it would be as stable as any of its relatives.

I've really been enjoying MXP so far, it feels like a cleaner and more clear-headed DXM to me, it has a nice, numbing body high that's pretty strong compared to the other dissos I've tried.

The body high I get from dissos is something I seek out, perhaps I should give this one a look. It just bothers me that doses are in the 100mg+ range most times. I worry about pissing out all 60mg of MXE metabolites when I indulge in that, so I have to wonder what MXP does to the kidneys.

So far, I've only gone up to 45mg and still get a nice body buzz (I always smoke weed with dissos too), I'm planning on trying 50-60mg today. From what I could find, it shouldn't be that damaging to the urinary tract. I have unrelated kidney issues and actually just recovered from a kidney infection recently and I've noticed no ill effects from the mxp, it didn't even cause any urinary retention at the doses I've tried so far, unlike 2f-k and ketamine. Not that I'm saying it's perfectly safe, but I've had zero issues so far and I usually notice them right away. Anyway, I thought even arylcyclohexylamines generally don't cause kidney damage unless you really abuse them? I thought they targeted the bladder mainly, but I could be wrong.

ACHA's don't really damage the bladder either unless you abuse them, it appears to be dose-related but is hard to avoid for more types of 'enthousiastic use'. Speaking of ketamine, yes with abuse there is damage done to the kidneys but a little less so or less noticeably than the ulcerative cystitis in the bladder. Even a bit less than that, there's also possible issues with the liver or more specifically the gallduct which can get blocked by some kind of hypertrophy.


I don't think we really know what makes ketamine (rather, it's metabolites) so irritating, it seems possible it is limited to things like MXE and K which metabolize to their respective nor-metabolites, while these piperidine derivatives hardly have that kind of metabolite at all. Just giving a wild example of a possibility.

Also: these lipophilic dissociatives like the PCP type stuff and diphs take a lot longer to clear so it just might be that they don't build up such high concentrations in the urine sitting in the bladder as K does, which is really most likely the crucial factor.

Okay thanks. Yeah, I mean for about a year or two (hell if I remember) I was using MXE once to three nights a week, and after a while I did begin to have concerns for my organs. At this point I'm long departed from that though, the disappearance of Mexxy has given me the control to use it only once or twice a year now.


I've had my eye on diphenidine longer but I can't seem to source it, while MXP is readily available to me. Perhaps I'll grab a sample with my next acquisition.

Thanks for clearing that up Solipsis, it makes a lot of sense that the high concentrations of K sitting in the bladder might be the biggest factor in organ damage. 


Cream Gravy, I think a sample is definitely worth trying. I did about 80-85mg last night and loved it, still no urinary issues whatsoever and the body high was fantastic and totally relieved any pain I was in. Next time I'm going straight for a 100mg dose. So far, it's the most clear-headed disso I've tried but I still have to try the PCP analogues and ephenidine. I was curious about diphenidine too but a lot of reports said that it felt cold and clinical, even dysphoric, so I might skip it. Then again, many people find MXP to be melancholic and it's been nothing but euphoric for me so far.

That makes sense if you didn't tried PCP analogs ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) MXP is melancholic in comparision with most of the arylcyclohexamines, but in comparision with diphenidine is pretty euphoric and warm. I enjoyed the 5g's of MXP I ordered back in time, but after trying 3-MeO-PCP/PCE and 2-OxO-PCE/PCM, I know I've got better compounds to choose from, so it's improbable that I'll ever spend a single euro on this compound again.


About diphenidine, it's indeed cold, disphoric and clinical without needing to compare it with anything. Like a hardcore version of ketamine without euforia, more amnesic, and with a lot of confussion. Really interesting to try, but I wouldn't touch it again even if I was paid for it. The only dissociative that lead me to the hospital after collapsing on the floor, can't remember a shit about my experiences with it ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)

^makes perfect sense ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) I do have quite a lot of experience with dxm and 2f-ketamine, and ketamine to a lesser extent, and I'd rate MXP as more purely euphoric than any of those, but I'm greatly anticipating trying the 3-MeO-PCx and 2-OxO-PCx compounds ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif) 


Diphenidine sounds intense, sounds like something that should be reserved for those who want to experience a balls-to-the-wall disso trip, but I think I can skip out on that one for now. Ephenidine sounds nice though, I have some but have yet to try it. I've read that it's more along the lines of MXP, but perhaps even warmer and more euphoric. I'm not really interested in holing on either of these substances, I just enjoy the high, particularly the body high. And of course, the music enhancement ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png) One thing I love about MXP is the energy and clarity of mind, it makes me want to move and it's one of the few dissos I could see myself really having a fun time dancing on.

It seems underrated to me, and strikes me as a good niche dissociative. I didn't get much euphoria or magic from it, but combined with a nice indica this dose actually put me to sleep and had me feeling fuzzy and warm. I am sure the effects are much different in the higher dosage range, and would like to try at least 35-50 mgs next time. It also seems like a good dissociative to combine with another disso as a means of potentiation.

Yeah I find most dissociatives become a much more positive experience when combined with Cannabis.  This stuff is pretty neutral for me without it but once I smoke some Cannabis it feels great.  It's not quite as out there and crazy/psychedelic as stuff like dxm or ketamine for me, but it's a nice dissociated comfy feeling.

I've tried a low dose of DXM (300mg) with 100mg of MXP (my normal dose is 140-150mg) and it was a pretty good experience.  It's pretty much what you'd expect.  A little bit of the DXM craziness mixed in with cleaner pure dissociation of MXP.  It wasn't anything groundbreaking but 300mg is a really low dose of DXM for me.  In fact the MXP wore off faster than the DXM so I was just left with the DXM feeling for the last couple hours of it and that part of it was kind of disappointing.  Please keep in mind I have done tons of DXM and have a high tolerance to it though. 300mg is only first plateau for me.

I keep my lysergimides in room temp and I haven't seen any degradation at 2+ years time. Things like MXE, phenethylamines, etc. seem to have an amazing shelf life. I don't have any MXP myself but I'm sure it would be as stable as any of its relatives.

Even some tryptamines have a pretty long shelf life.  I had a batch of 4-ACO-DMT that sat in an envelope in a room temperature closet for 10+ years and it hadn't lost any of it's potency in that time that I could tell (compared to brand new batches I have).  From what I've read it seems some of the 4-HO ones have faster degradation but I haven't hung onto any of those long enough to find out.

My dear friend tried MXP + DXM a few weeks ago, he said it was pure and intense dissociation. He claimed as he began to came down it was fun and euphoric, but prior to that he was simply dissociated from the concepts of "fun" or "euphoria". He was relatively incoherent during the peak and seemed to hit thought loops occasionally. Doses were 120 mg MXP and ~200 mg DXM HBr. It should be noted the MXP was dosed about 3 hours after the DXM.

Had 90mg oral yesterday. I had just had this 1 time before. That time I took extremely little as it was my first dissociative in more than 5 years. I ended up getting to around that same dosage but found out redosing was not increasing much the experience.


This time it took around 2.5 hours to hit, though at +1 I was already feeling something. It took me to a not bad kind of ecstatic dissociation. That state prolonged for 3 hours and then I was left with some lingering dissociation. After 3.5 hours of that worthless state I killed it with a benzo and drifted into sleep.


As a curiosity just to mention that I heard somebody in the forum one time saying he was doing headstands on ketamine. I normaly do them in my training. So I tried to see how it went, and it was just curious to see how easy it was. Easier than in a normal state of conciousness. I just went up with no effort whatsoever and even if I felt constantly like I was going to fall, I could keep it with no trouble.


It felt quite toxic in the after effects and next morning and I felt a few stitches in my kidneys area.

I regret not to have taken more, maybe around 150mg to see where I could get mentaly. I might repeat the experiment one day on that level as I still have enough left from the sample. But most likely I won't use it again.

75-80mg is *really* intense and dreamy for me.


15mg the other day was still a + and felt awesome to drink beers and dance on, seemed to work as a pain-killer (paint distracter?) at this level too as my foot is absolutely smashed up from a recent skateboarding malfunction.

I tried this one last weekend for the first time at 40mg, but in combination with 40 mg mxp. I had a wonderful time. Maybe mxp is more suitable at low doses (40-60mg) to enhance other dissos. At 40mg mxp and 40mg mxe I was holing in a beautiful, satisfied manner and the visuals... Did not even tripped that hard on psychedelics, but I never took high doses so that is probably the reason. Here is a link to my (extended) tripreport for those who are interested.

I had my most spiritual experience ever with this stuff back in the day. 150mg intravenous, no fear, no panic. A strange encounter with a female entity. To this day that is the one chemical experience that has stayed with me. I stopped using heroin, cocaine, even gave up smoking pot. I'm still the hard headed sceptic I've always been, I haven't found God, but I know that there are things beyond human everyday experience. Using methoxyphenidate was a truly life changing experience for me

Had some recent experiences with this compound again after a year and a half of no dissociatives whatsoever. In the past I had ordered a gram of this to experiment with, and found it mild but euphoric with a nice, day-long afterglow. After going through most of the first MXP thread I realized that the underwhelming effects my friend and I felt were due to snorting this compound. While they were still noticeable, they were nowhere near what others were mentioning in relation to 100mg+ doses. A 200mg line came nowhere near hole-like effects.


Finding an online vendor that would ship to Canada, I decided to invest and ordered 5gs of the stuff with a couple other mephedrone analogues. Having realized that oral is the way to go, my first dose of this new batch was a 200mg parachute, aiming specifically for a hole experience. For context I am quite experienced with dissociation, primarily through ketamine but also with one previous DXM experience and a few times with MXE. Also rather experienced with psychedelics of both the tryptamine and phenethlyamine  families. When it comes to ketamine I usually dose high so for this I was taking the same route. Anyways, to the trips:


Experience 1


Set: 

Excited but nervous. Recently have been feeling rather isolated and lonely, having moved to Montreal with only a handful of friends in the area. Have been experiencing some wild swings of depression, not at all aided by the ferocious winter storms we've been having this early in the season. Other heavy topics lie close to the surface as well.


Setting: 

Small basement apartment shared with 2 other roommates, one of which I am rather close with. Kind of dirty (build-up of dishes, food-crusted appliances, etc.) as one of the roommates doesn't know how to clean for herself. My room where I spent the majority of the time was a bit messy but navigable under the influence. Small single bed with a reasonable amount of space for my belongings. Outside was extremely snowy, meaning I was stuck indoors for duration.


The Trip: 

Began at roughly 5pm. With a 200mg parachute weighed and downed, I also scaled out 50mgs and divided that into two lines. I snorted one in order to induce the onset quicker, then laid back and pumped music through my speakers. Within 20 minutes I was feeling light effects from the line. This included the sharpening of lines in the wood floor paneling, heightened brightness of certain surfaces, and a peculiar "rounding" of objects and dimensions. I can only explain this as an underlying "spherical-ness" present in most parts of the background. This extended to walls, windows, corners, etc. When the parachute began to hit in earnest, I turned to my laptop for entertainment. Decided on a movie, X-men Days of Future Past. This is where dissociation became rather noticeable.

Within 10 minutes of watching the film I developed the radical notion that it wasn't actually a movie I was experiencing but a window into another timeline. Even though i knew it as a file and a movie on my laptop, I was still convinced it was something more, that it had never actually been filmed but somehow captured, a series of moments incised and frozen forever for my viewing pleasure. Soon I was unable to remain focused on the film and the laptop as the dissociation continued to grow in intensity. I began spinning in my bed, acting like a hurricane to the sheets and blankets, unsure of what I was trying to accomplish but knowing that something was required of me, some action that I could not specify or even really identify. At this point I decided to snort the second line I had set out. In hindsight this was definitely unnecessary. My vision was darkening and impacted. The dissociation kept accelerating until I reached what must have been a hole state


Within the hole I remember little. I was a shelf, and on me was stored a compartmentalized version of every family unit that existed at the present moment. Heavy confusion permeated this vision, and the experience felt very reminiscent of a fever dream's delirium. I had no sense of my own body, and even my existence as a shelf only consisted of the idea that it was true to my mind. I felt every box of family's placed upon me, but not in the sense of a weight being placed upon me. It was more a mental hollowness being filled than anything physical. I am not sure how long this lasted, but it was no longer than 2 hours. What else may have occurred in my head during this time is unknown, as my memory was heavily (and negatively) affected by my dose.


Once I was out of the hole the rest of the trip was unremarkable. I felt alert but not stimulated, mildly confused but not "foggy," and was experiencing a weird pressure on the left side of my head. This concerned me for a while, but seemed to leave no impact and didn't overly impair my ability to fall asleep afterwards. By the time midnight rolled around, I was able to pass out to a satisfying, if somewhat light sleep. From this experience I was able to deduce that my initial dose was much too high and that I would need much lower amounts to mimic the light joyfulness I had encountered with my initial intranasal doses way back. The dissociation was unsettling to me due in part to my (slightly impaired) mobility. With ketamine I am used to the encumbrance induced that helps prevent any accidental injury from moving around while being unaware of one's surroundings. With MXP there is some clumsiness to movement but it is not completely stifled and therefore I feel more prone to mishaps. With all this in mind I decided to shelf the remaining amount until I felt ready to experiment once more.


I will write up the second trip later today or tomorrow. I started with a much smaller initial dose (100mg) and felt the wonderful warmth and euphoria that has been mentioned before in these threads. An afterglow also lasted for a good 24 hours, and it was a revelatory experience much more in line with a transcendental k-hole than the strange fever-dream delirium state I experienced in the above trip. Seems there is a wide range to effects possible with this highly-enticing compound!

HipsterLink you are right on ROA nasal is almost useless with this one, I think the drip is responsible for most of the effects when snorted.

I forgot I had (that is how I interpret the encounters) problems with demonic presences after experimenting with 2-Oxo-PCE too much in an extraordinarily stressful period of my life. Now I am pretty sure, that demons or let's say anti-spirits (energetic beings, that are drawn to desperate, psychologically instable physical beings and try to manipulate them for their gruesome needs, that is how people end up in the psych ward and become seemingly permanently schizophrenic) can enter our reality, feed of one's sorrow and try to escalate it even further to get more energy out of the sufferer.


The encounter with such an entity is not scary or dangerous per se, it acts through scaremongering and manipulation (just like our media :D). It is harmless as long as you are grounded and stable. So now in desperate phases I don't touch dissos/psychedelics, because it is counter-productive, to say the least.


If noone believes me, I have no problem with that. It will only become reality, when your mind is in a restless, borderline-psychotic state, so scientifically those phenomena will be explained by electromagnetic activity in certain parts of the brain, that cause hallucinations. For me that proofs nothing, since the electromagnetic activity could be interpreted as a feedback arousal to the actual metaphysical/transdimensional encounter.


Okay enough with OT. I wish I once could meet a friendly spirit. ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

Dissos can connect you to some righteously dark energies, totally Ziiirp.


I've had multiple demonic experiences on dissos, including MXE, 3-MeO-PCP, and O-PCE.

I had one of my most profound and bizarre drug experiences on this about three years ago. I was irresponsibly eyeballing insufflated doses with a friend and in the ensuing dissociative amnesic fugue ended up redosing multiple times. What followed was an incredibly intense experience in which I blacked out for a brief period and became convinced my parents had somehow discovered I was on this scatty research chemical and were very disappointed in me. Needless to say this didn't happen at all and my friend who was only slightly less fucked than I was had to repeatedly assure me of this for around 10 minutes. There was a significant amount of weird sensory distortion, my small bedroom seemd like an immense cavernous space and objects lurched around wildly in my field of vision. My ears were also ringing intensely, which was accompanied by the feeling that I was vibrating at an incredibly high frequency. 


This period eventually subsided and my friend and I were left with the profound sense that we had just immerged from the other side of something wild and ineffable, discombobulated but triumphant. We decided to redose again and smoke some bongs. After this we lay down in the dark and listened to an album by Stars Of The Lid. I proceded to enter into an intense and insanely abstract pseudo-hole. 


The closest I can get to accurately describing it is the feeling that every single particle that makes up my being was, to borrow the words of another bluelighter whose name I can't recall right now, "vibrated into incoherent waves". This amazing sensation (the feeling was almost orgasmic in its intensity) came with the delusionally euphoric understanding that by slightly moving my extremities I could weave entire universes into being. When this died down, I simply drifted through the astral planes for a while. As I came down, I recall my friend suddenly sitting bolt upright in bed as he immerged from his own experience and proclaiming "I now truly understand the difference between material wealth and wealth of the soul!" Easily ranks up in my top 5 ever drug experiences, perhaps even life experiences in general.

Strange, for me "spiritual" does not mean contact with spirits.  It implies an experience that excites my spirit!  I have no point other than this.  Never tried MXP but I like dissociatives.  I hear this one tends to cause amnesia.

I love MXP. It works as a brilliant anti-depressent, although I'd often find myself unable to speak for potentially hours, just by overdosing slightly.


It also has this thing where it always makes my skin feel really tight, I loved that feeling.

This wasn't my first time with the compound, just my first time with oral dosing. I had snorted it maybe 4 or 5 times in the past, once mixed with ketamine for a wholly unforgettable and intensely terrifying hole where I encountered hostile entities in what I felt was the crack between realities. Would not recommend that mixture, somehow it made the trip more lucid and aided in the recollection. It also seemed to nullify the depressive effects of k, allowing me to wander around the hotel room me and some buddies had rented and almost throw myself off the balcony (couldn't get the door open thank god). 


I just finished writing up the second oral experience, I'm going to post that in trip reports with the first one there as well. And to Treezy totally agree with you, for the amounts I was snorting I should have been in whole other worlds, instead of just feeling elated rubbing against walls ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)


BTW here's the link to the trip report, have the second experience included there. Figured it would be too long of a post for this thread.

I have some of this, have had it for a long time already. People report it to be kind of dirty, but that was not my one experience with it. It felt like a real gentle and warm dissociation, 40mg iirc, I'll be trying it again in the future. It seems to shine most orally.

I haven't tried any of the phindines... I really want to try ephenidine, it seems to have the best reviews.  I'm curious about them all though.

I think this substance is the shittiest dissociative. I acquired what I hoped to be lifetime supply of MXE pre-ban and it turned out to be this. It took us several tries spread over few months to figure that it wasn't the set and the setting messing up with us but it was totally not MXE and this shitty compound. And by the time we figured out, ban was on ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)((((


Anyway, did anyone find a way to make this be somewhat a nice experience? From my many trials to make this work for myself, rather high doses (120mg or so) is when it starts to become interesting. Otherwise it is quite dysphoric, physically debilitating but not fully hole-y, and makes pretty much any of my friends sick - tho surprisingly, I seem to fare OK.

Setting: at home, laying in bed, listening to some music and some ambient sound.

I tried this substance for the first time today just after the peak of my acid trip. I've only tripped like 2 times before using 150mcg of 1p-lsd.

Today I took 300mcg of 1p-lsd, which was a strong experience for me. Just after the peak (around 7 hours after dosing my lsd) I got the idea of trying out MXP.


I'm not sure why I thought to take it now, but I did. I took 50-60mg of mxp (inaccurate scale and some eye balling). This was my first dissociative ever, so I wasn't prepared. I thought 50-60mg would be a light dose since I've seen way bigger doses around online. I felt a bit woozy at first, it felt like I was kind of drunk ish? After a while, I was just existing. I was staring at the wall, but my mind couldn't focus on any visuals or think anything really. I think I holed, but I wouldn't know since I don't have anything to compare it to and from what I know I took a light dose.


To sum it up, I lost touch of reality a couple times but it was a fun experience over all. I would recommend this combination for

I never really advise people explore new drug classes (such as dissociatives) in combinations, and for one's first run-in with a compound while on a personal-highest-ever dose of LSD, it sounds like you have exceptional control of your mind and a good foresight for set and setting. I would love to hear more about how your trip went, I've yet to be able to access/try any diarylethylamines but have mixed LSD with maybe 5-8 arylcyclohexylamines throughout my life and have found them to click well, though cross-potentiate. 


Taking them later on in a trip sort of "reinvigorates" the trip for me, if that makes sense, did you experience similar?


Also, do you intend on trying MXP on its own in the future to compare and/or contrast back to this experience?

Shortly after writing my previous post I compulsively redosed like 2 times and combined it with benzos and kratom and I was out of it for a week or so. I couldn't focus on anything, my whole mind was a fog. Every time I closed my eyes I hallucinated things with decent vividness (I knew it wasn't real but it was still very distracting). My dreams were also extremely vivid.  I felt dissociated for multiple days and I can't say I'm fully recovered yet but mostly. When I looked at my screen, I was just looking, my mind didn't grasp anything I looked at. When I walked through the street, everything felt fake. I slept like 15+ hours a day for 3 days and only now am I feeling like myself again. I went through a lot of mental anguish but I've forgotten a lot of it due to the nature of these substances.


As to whether I'd do it again, maybe on it's own or combined with LSD again, I don't know, but not any time soon. I don't have much left of it, just enough for 1 decent dose. 

The trip itself is hard to describe. I didn't feel super euphoric and the MXP seemed to blunt the LSD's introspection slightly but not fully. I was in a state of pure existence if that make sense. I was meditating for maybe 30 minutes but it felt like ages. I felt whole. 


If you have any questions I'd be open to answering them.
