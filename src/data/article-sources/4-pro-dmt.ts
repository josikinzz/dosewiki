4-PrO-DMT, also known as 4-propionyloxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine or as O-propionylpsilocin, is a synthetic psychedelic drug of the tryptamine family with psychedelic that is believed to act as a prodrug of psilocin (4-HO-DMT). It has been sold online as a designer drug since May 2019. It was first identified as a new psychoactive substance in Sweden, in July 2019. A number of related derivatives have been synthesized as prodrugs of psilocin for medical applications.

## Use and effects

4-PrO-DMT is reported to be orally active and while effects have been studied in mice, its effects and longevity on humans have not been formally studied. The effects of 4-PrO-DMT are similar to those of psilocin (4-HO-DMT), as it acts as a prodrug of this compound. This is analogous to the case of 4-AcO-DMT and psilocybin (4-PO-DMT).

## Toxicity

Very little data about the toxicity or pharmacology of 4-PrO-DMT is known. Its chemical structure and pharmacological activity are similar to psilacetin, a compound which isn't associated with compulsive use or physical dependence. However, due to lack of research and data, it cannot be definitively concluded that its pharmacological actions in the human body do not differ from those of psilacetin. To date, there have been no reported deaths from 4-PrO-DMT.

## Interactions

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

4-PrO-DMT is theorized to be a serotonergic psychedelic, and is partial agonist of the 5-HT1D, 5-HT1B and 5-HT1A serotonin receptors. It produces the head-twitch response in mice.
