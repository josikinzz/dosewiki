## Subjective Experience

Like most teas, green tea is made from a species called camellia sinensis. However, in
the words of Wikipedia, for green tea the leaves and buds "have not undergone the
same withering and oxidation process used to make oolong teas and black teas".
Note also that green teas differ based upon the variety of camellia sinensis used, time
of harvest, growing conditions, and horticultural and production methods.

Whilst it originated in China, it is now also produced in other parts of Asia, and is
hugely popular across the world.

I used to diss the idea that it should be included in this book, until I actually started
to drink it regularly in the afternoons. I discovered that the uplift quality was indeed
different to regular tea: it was generally more mellow and rounded and with
something of a feel-good factor. There was also a total absence of jitteriness,
presumably due to lower levels of caffeine and higher levels of l-theanine. It is
certainly worthy of exploration and experimentation.
