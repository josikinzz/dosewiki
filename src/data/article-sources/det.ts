## SYNTHESIS
A solution of 19 g indol-3-yl N,N-diethylglyoxylamide in 350 mL anhydrous dioxane was added, slowly, to 19 g LAH in 350 mL dioxane which was well stirred and held at reflux temperature under an inert atmosphere. After the addition was complete, reflux was maintained for an additional 16 h, the reaction mixture cooled, and the excess hydride destroyed by the cautious addition of wet dioxane. The formed solids were removed by filtration, washed with hot dioxane, the filtrate and washings combined, dried over anhydrous MgSO4, and the solvent removed under vacuum. The residue was dissolved in anhydrous Et2O and saturated with anhydrous hydrogen chloride. There were formed crystals which were recrystallized from benzene/methanol to give a yield of 14.7 g (75%) of N,N-diethyltryptamine hydrochloride (DET) with mp of 170â171 Â°C.

(from tryptamine) To a solution of 1.6 g tryptamine base in 20 mL isopropanol, there was added 5.5 mL diisopropylethylamine and 2.3 mL ethyl bromide. After stirring at room temperature for 36 h the volatiles were removed under vacuum on the rotary evaporator and the light brown residue (5.17 g) was treated with 5 mL of acetic anhydride and heated in the steam bath for 5 min. After coming to room temperature, 3.5 mL ammonium hydroxide was added, and the exothermic reaction was allowed to return to room temperature. The reaction mixture was suspended in 150 mL 0.5 N H2SO4, and washed with 3Ã40 mL CH2Cl2. The pooled washes were again extracted with 150 mL 0.5 N H2SO4 and the aqueous phases again washed with CH2Cl2. The aqueous phases were combined, made basic with 6 N NaOH, and then extracted with 3Ã40 mL CH2Cl2. The pooled extracts were stripped of solvent under vacuum, and the residue (1.49 g of a dark oil with a sharp smell) was distilled at the KugelRohr. The product, N,N-diethyltryptamine, distilled at 175â185 Â°C at 0.05 mm/Hg to yield a white oil weighing 1.02 g, which spontaneously crystallized. This product was dissolved in 20 mL boiling hexane, cooled to room temperature, and seeded. There was thus obtained 0.72 g of a white waxy crystalline material melting at 84â87 Â°C. IR (in cm-1): 741, 804, 970, 1018, 1067, 1090 and 1120. MS (in m/z): C5H12N+ 86 (100%); indolemethylene+ 130 (6%); parent ion 206 (1%). The hydrochloride salt (crystallizing spontaneously from an IPA solution of the base treated with a few drops of concentrated HCl) had a mp 169â171 Â°C, and the following fingerprint: IR (in cm-1): 717 (br.), 759, 847, 968, 1017, 1110. This salt appears to be unstable, darkening with time.


## DOSAGE

## DURATION

## QUALITATIVE COMMENTS
(with 75 mg, orally) âOnset seemed to be at 40 minutes, which were mostly physical symptoms, which seemed to fade away at 1.25 hours. All in all, an absolutely profound, enriching experience with both Brahms (G-minor piano quartet) and Verdi (requiem) contributing mightily. All over in 3.5â4.5 hours and a delightful afterglow.â

(with 150 mg, orally) âThere was a slow onset. It was more than an hour before something started, which I didnât believe at first but which became completely undeniable. I was heading toward an appointment, and walked right past the meeting place. I was unable to concentrate on just where I was and where I was hoping to go. With enormous effort I located my appointment coordinates but the sidewalk was doing funny things and I again managed to miss my target. I sat down to try to manage things, but I couldnât.â

(with 150 mg, orally) âThe effects were manifestly notable in 50â60 minutes, quite intense from hour one to hour three. Then there is an hour when trailing is still perceptible. By hour five it is all over. There appeared to be âvegetative effectsâ as they used to say. I definitely noted sweating of hands and feet. There was a hollowness in the chest. There was an insignificant presser response, but pronounced tachycardia, with my normal resting pulse in the 60âs going up above 100 for a while. I think that 150 milligrams is a little too much.â

(with 400 mg, orally) âToo much.â

(with 40 mg, smoking) âI have found that ten milligrams of DET is the size of a match head, so I smoked four of them. The taste of the stuff is terribleâit smells like burning plasticâbut I donât care. The onset was gentle, in about five minutes, euphoric and empathogenic, and there was an immediate camaraderie with the group I was with (they were using between twenty and forty milligrams apiece). I found myself stroking a calico cat, and asked a friend, âDo people purr?â and was told, âSure, if you know how to listen.â We began scratching one anotherâs backs, and made vaguely purring noises.â

(with 90 mg, smoking) âThis was with 3Ã30 milligrams, at ten minute intervals. It took almost too much concentration for the last toke. Too stoned. Some emotional insights, but I canât remember them to write them. Fine muscular tremor. Some hangover the next day, lassitude, fine edge of thought was blunted.â

(with 40 mg, subcutaneously) âThere was a slight burning and a numbness of both the hands and feet some twenty minutes. A few minutes later I felt an alcohol-like intoxication and a slight drifting of thoughts. Music was slightly enhanced and eyes-closed patterning was noted, with a predominance of greens and oranges. No music, no patterns. The effects peaked at 30 minutes, but the numbness I felt lasted up to three hours. Overall, this was somewhat disappointing.â

(with 60 mg, intramuscularly) âThe yellow walls with many windows in them, massing over one another, appeared in increased intensity, had an air of medieval mood about them. The ornaments, painted white, on the roof and eaves had a particularly strong decorative effect. A test subject, without a painterâs fantasy, must certainly be greatly impressed by this depth and colorfulness. I felt as I did when I began to learn painting, when I tried to look at things consciously with a painterâs eye. I felt that the drug acted on fantasy, in the first place, increasing its dynamism. On a subject with normal mind, this experience will certainly have an astonishing and marvelous effect. An artist with creative mind and fantasy will be less impressed.â

(with 60 mg, intramuscularly) âAbout 15 minutes after the injection came the same vegetative symptoms seen with DMT. The illusions and hallucinations were the same. But the alteration of the surrounding world and the emotional reaction to them were strong and impressive. The mask-like faces of the persons, the dream-like mysteriousness of the objects in the room gave me the feeling that I had arrived in another world, entirely different and queer and full of secrecy and mystery. The wonderful but strange world attracted me at one moment, but the next moment I did not want to accept it. I became perplexed; I did not know what I ought to do. I began to walk anxiously up and down, and said, âI ought to do something, I must!â There was a peculiar double orientation in space and time: I knew where I was, but I was inclined to accept this strange world as a reality, too. The dusk of the room was lightened for some minutes, and again the light was switched off, and that seemed to me as if this period might be an entire epoch, filled with events and happenings, but at the same time I knew that only several minutes had passed.â

(with 60 mg, intramuscularly) âThe vertigo is goneânow comes the attraction. I have the honor of seeing the elements of the universe in this moment. As if I saw algae, flagellates under the microscope, in black and white. Now I see some colours, too. As if I saw a shell, the rainbow colours are disintegrating rapidly. Oneâs consciousness becomes air-like. From the neck upward I am feeling a shapeless lightness. If we could inoculate this into all men, human inter-relations would undoubtedly improve greatly.â

(with 60 mg, intravenously) âI was looking out of the window. I was seeing the leaves of a tree, the color of the grass, people walking to and fro utterly without thinking, like a small child staring at things. I felt as if I were discovering the world anew.â

(with 60 mg, intravenously) âThe objects opened up their essence to me, I was feeling as if I knew them as they really are, I live in them and was in direct contact with them. I felt an enormous drive to write, to put down the marvelous feelings. The associations came spontaneously, but I was unable to concentrate in a way required for working. Anyway, I did not want to miss one moment of the visions.â


## EXTENSIONS AND COMMENTARY
Several clinical studies were conducted in the late 1950âs and early 1960âs. They employed the oppressive oppresive research environment that was considered scientific at that time, and there were variable results. One study involved ten physically normal subjects, who were unemployed men from a depressed mining area. The DET was administered in i.m. injections and trials were conducted in a partially soundproofed experimental clinic equipped with a one-way mirror and microphones. The subjects were subjected to a battery of psychological tests and body function measurements at frequent intervals. The consensus expressed was one of dysphoria. Neurological signs varied from slight generalized tremors to gross athetoid movements. Among the bizarre somatic complaints were such as: âAir is rushing through my body,â âMy chest is empty and there is a jelly ball in my spine,â âMy hands arenât there, my whole body feels funny.â All subjects experienced dizziness and increased sweating. Six of the subjects stated that the experience was an unpleasant one, three of them markedly so. There was no enthusiasm in the group for a repetition of the experience, and several stated that they would leave the clinical center before submitting to it again. A similar study with ten chronic paranoid schizophrenic patients (in the same setting and with the same dosage) produced similar effects. Most became pale, shaky, and either complained of feeling sick or actually vomiting. Several also developed tremors. In general, these were pretty negative experiences, and contribute to the negative medical and scientific opinions that are held concerning these drugs.

Another study was carried out in an entirely different setting, with professional colleagues, with other professionals and with artists. These were with personal friends of the research scientists, rather than strangers to them. The observed mood changes (produced, in this study, by the i.m. administration of 0.70 to 0.80 mg/kg of DET) were described as being in the direction of euphoria; the subjects generally enjoyed the experience and wished to repeat it. The volunteered comments under the drug tended towards the mystical and philosophical, and several of these experimental subjects responded to music and art in ways that were new to them.

In the earliest research with DET and the related dialkyltryptamines, the chemistry of metabolism was studied for any clues that could explain the activity of these materials. It must be remembered that this was in the heyday of the concept of psychotomimesis, the search for drugs that would imitate the psychotic state. What an appealing concept, that there might be a drug that could produce the syndrome of mental illness and thus be an accepted model for designing some treatment for it. There was a delicious search made at that time (the 1950âs) for names that could be given to these remarkable substances that would obscure any spiritual or positive aspects, so that one could present oneâs findings into the orthodox medical literature. At that time, I chose to use the name psychotomimetic in the titles of my publications, because I knew it might deflect criticism from the medical community for the findings that I described. But such a variety of names were used as keywords to these studies. In my notes I find: âdelirients,â âdelusionogenics,â âdysleptics,â âmisperceptinogens,â âmysticomimetics,â âphanerothymes,â âphantasticants,â âpharmakons,â âpsychosomimeticsâ (an âsâ for the âtâ? why?), âpsychotaraxics,â âpsychoticants,â âpsychotogens,â âpsychogens,â âpsychotoxinsâ and âschizogens.â Not a very appealing collection from which to choose a week-end trip.

In 1956, Humphry Osmond suggested, at a New York Academy of Science meeting that it might be less pejorative to soften the prefix that was used to relate to the mind from psychoto- or psycho-(used in medical diagnoses that are largely negative) to a misspelled but softer alternative, psyche- (which had not yet been tarred by the image of medical pathology). His suggestion was âpsychedelic,â it was aped in many trials with such creations as âpsychephoricâ (mind-moving), âpsychehormicâ (mind-rousing), âpsycheplasticâ (mind-molding), âpsychezymicâ (mind-fermenting), âpsycherhexicâ (mind-bursting-forth) and âpsychelyticâ (mind-releasing). But, psychedelic (mind-manifesting) has weathered all storms, and is now a fixed component of our vocabulary. There are several recent contributions for possible class names for some of these compounds, such as entheogen (God-created-within), entactogen (touching-within) or empathogen (the discovery of empathy), are creations that try to address the integrity and warmth that can be part of the psychedelic experience. Each uses the suffix, â-gen,â that suggests genesis, or creation. Each has its use, and each has its limitations. One must remember that none of these terms describe what occurs within an experience. Their value is limited to the search for a label for the drugs that allow these experiences to happen.

Back to the metabolism discussion. And to the search for the actual drug, the magic bullet, that actually precipitated a model schizophrenic state. If one were to find it, one could look skillfully for the counterpart in the human animal, the one that simply appeared on the scene from some mismanaged metabolic process, and thus could be blamed for mental illness. It had been observed that the longer the chains on the N,N-disubstituted tryptamine, the less the potency. And the longer the chains, the less of the drug was excreted as the 6-hydroxyl metabolite. This focused attention on the hydroxy metabolites of the two simplest and most potent of the dialkyltryptamines, DMT and DET.

6-HO-DET has been observed to be a minor human metabolite of DET, with the excretion of about 20% of the administered dose as the glucoronide conjugate. In a study with normal and schizophrenic patients, a positive correlation was observed between the amount of 6-HO-DET excreted and the intensity of the experience. Also, there was a suggestion that the schizophrenics produced greater amounts of this metabolite. This led to a hypothesis that perhaps it was an active factor in the generation of the intoxicated state. In principle, as with bufotenine, that bare, exposed polar hydroxyl group should make its entry to the brain quite difficult. But, on the other hand, if it were generated there from DET after it had gotten into the brain, entry would not be a concern and the lipophilic barrier could serve to make its exit difficult. Then, if it were an effective compound, it might well be a long acting one. There is an early report of the self-administration intramuscularly, within a single subject, of 10 milligrams milligrasms 6-HO-DET with the description of what appeared to be DET-like effects from about the second to fourth hour. Although this report suggested that it was several times more potent than DET, it has never been replicated and it does not jibe too well with the 6-HO-DMT report below.

As a challenge to the hypothesis that hydroxylation at the 6-position of the N,N-dialkyltryptamines might play some role in the expression of the activity, this position was metabolically blocked by the insertion of a fluorine atom there, giving 6-F-DET. This compound, with DET as the control, was studied in some twelve hospitalized alcoholics at doses of about 60, 80 and 100 milligrams intramuscularly. It âdoes produce autonomic effects, pupillary changes, blood pressure changes; but it does not produce the drifting away into a dream world and other phenomena characteristic for the hallucinogenic activity.â The experimenters considered its possible experimental role as an âactive placeboâ but nothing more was done with it.

6-HO-DMT is a minor metabolite of DMT in man, and it was studied for the same reasons. Could this compound play a role in explaining the activity of the parent dialkylamine? It was explored in a series of subjects who had responded spectacularly to DMT. The five volunteers in this study were former opium addicts who were serving sentences for violation of United States narcotics laws. They were administered 6-HO-DMT at either 0.75 mg/kg (one subject) or 1.0 mg/kg (four subjects) and reported no differences from the inactive placebo control. The objective measures (blood pressure, respiration and heart rate, pupillary dilation) confirmed this absence of activity at this level. The active control drug was DMT itself, and it showed the expected responses in all regards.

I have always been quite skeptical, and just a little embarrassed, that so many of these early studies used hospitalized patients, schizophrenics, alcoholics, and prisoners as subjects. These latter experiments were carried out at the Lexington, Kentucky Public Health Service Hospital. This has been for years a major site for human research in the area of addictive or psychotropic drugs. But it cannot be forgotten that it was first, and foremost, a prison and the people there were prisoners. Complete A complete objectivity of reporting, from a person who is in custody and who might wish to please his jailers, is unlikely. The whole scene started shortly after the Harrison Narcotics Act passed back near the time of World War I. The medical profession held that narcotics addiction was a medical problem, and the legal authorities held that it was a legal problem. In other words, was a heroin user sick, or was he a criminal? The law enforcement viewpoint prevailed, the physicians who objected went to jail, and the addicts went to what were called ânarcotics farms.â They were indeed prisons, but the name carried the politically correct suggestion of rehabilitation. And it was at the last of these, at Lexington, that this hydroxylated DMT study was done.

The results were negative, to the disappointment of the researchers. It is pretty generally accepted that 6-HO-DMT is inactive. I am not too surprised. There are so few things with open and exposed hydroxyl groups that succeed in making it through the lipid barriers that protect to the brain.

**Diethyltryptamine** (also known as **N,N-DET** or **DET** ) is a synthetic [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) [tryptamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tryptamine) and a close structural analog of [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT) (Dimethyltryptamine). It is extremely uncommon and has little history of human usage.

In the 1950s, the endogenous production of psychoactive agents was considered to be a potential explanation for the hallucinatory symptoms of some psychiatric diseases; this is known as the transmethylation hypothesis.

Early studies of DET as well as other psychedelics were mainly focused on their presumed psychotomimetic properties. Researchers theorized that abnormal metabolites of endogenous chemicals such as tryptamine, serotonin, and tryptophan could be the explanation for mental disorders such as schizophrenia, or psychosis.

## Chemistry

DET, or N,N-diethyltryptamine, is a synthetic indole alkaloid molecule of the [tryptamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tryptamine) class. Tryptamines share a core structure comprised of a bicylic indole heterocycle attached at R 3 to an amino group via an ethyl side chain. DMT contains two ethyl groups CH 2 CH 3 - bound to the terminal amine R N of its tryptamine backbone. DET has many substituted analogues such as [4-HO-DET](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-HO-DET) ("ethocin").

DET is an analogue of the common tryptamine hallucinogen N,N-Dimethyltryptamine or DMT. Although DET is a synthetic compound with no known natural sources, it has been used in conjunction with the mycelium of *Psilocybe cubensis* to produce the synthetic chemicals 4-PO-DET (Ethocybin) and 4-HO-DET (Ethocin), as opposed to the naturally occurring 4-PO-DMT (Psilocybin) and 4-HO-DMT (Psilocin). Isolation of the alkaloids resulted in 3.3% 4-HO-DET and 0.01-0.8% 4-PO-DET.

## Pharmacology

Due to the lack of research regarding the substance, all discussion regarding the pharmacology of it is purely based on its structure and subjective effect similarities to other [tryptamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tryptamine) [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) such as [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) and [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT) . With this in mind, DET is thought to act as an [5-HT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) 2A partial agonist. Unlike [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT) , the ethyl groups add protection against the monoamine oxidase enzyme system, allowing DET to be orally active, while DMT is not.

DET is sometimes preferred over DMT because it can be taken orally, whereas DMT cannot. This is because the enzyme monoamine oxidase degrades DMT into an inactive compound before it is absorbed. To overcome this, it must be administered in a different manner, i.e. intravenously, intramuscularly, by inhalation, by insufflation, rectally, or ingested along with an inhibitor of monoamine oxidase. Because DET has ethyl groups attached to its nitrogen atom, monoamine oxidase is unable to degrade it. This is also true for many other tryptamines with larger nitrogen substituents.

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*

## Toxicity and harm potential

The toxicity and long-term health effects of recreational DET has not been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dose is unknown. This is because DET is a [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) with a limited history of human usage. However, it is presumed to have a similar toxicity profile as [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT) due to similarities in their chemical structure.

Anecdotal reports from those who have tried DET suggests that there are no negative health effects attributed to simply trying the substance by itself at low to moderate doses and using it very sparingly (but nothing can be completely guaranteed). [Independent research](https://www.google.com/) should always be done to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe before consumption.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this substance.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

Although no formal studies have been conducted, it is believed that DET is not habit-forming and the desire to use it can actually decrease with use.

Tolerance to the effects of DET is built almost immediately after ingestion. After that, it takes about 3 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 7 days to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). DET presents cross-tolerance with all [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) , meaning that after the consumption of DET all psychedelics will have a reduced effect.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **[Lithium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_(medication))** - Lithium is often used as treatment for bipolar disorder. It can dangerously amplify the intensity of psychedelics and has been strongly linked with psychosis and seizures. The causes are poorly understood, but it may be due to its [glutaminergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Glutamate) and [GABAergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GABA) properties. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants)** - Stimulants affect many parts of the brain. Combined with psychedelics, stimulation can turn into uncontrollable [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [panic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) , [thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops) and [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) . This interaction may cause elevated risk of psychosis. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol)** - Tramadol lowers the seizure threshold and [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) may act as triggers for seizures, particularly in those who are predisposed to them. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diethyltryptamine*

Diethyltryptamine (DET), also known as N,N-diethyltryptamine or T-9, is a psychedelic drug of the tryptamine family closely related to dimethyltryptamine (DMT). It is taken orally, but can also be used by parenteral routes.
The drug acts as a non-selective serotonin receptor agonist, including of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor among others. It has not been found to occur endogenously. DMT is a close structural homologue of DMT and dipropyltryptamine (DPT). Other analogues of DET include 4-HO-DET (ethocin), ethocybin (4-PO-DET), and 5-MeO-DET.
DET was first synthesized in 1956 by Stephen Szára and subsequently described in material published in 1957. More systematic studies were reported later by Szára and colleagues and independently by Böszörményi and colleagues.

## Use and effects

According to Alexander Shulgin in his book TiHKAL (Tryptamines I Have Known and Loved), DET's dose range is 50 to 100 mg orally and its duration is 2 to 4 hours. It was also assessed at oral doses of 44 to 400 mg, though 150 mg was described as "a little too much" and the 400 mg dose was simply described as "too high". Its onset is 40 minutes to more than 1 hour and peak effects occurred at just over 1 hour. In addition to oral administration, DET was assessed by smoking at doses of 40 to 90 mg, by subcutaneous injection at a dose of 40 mg, by intramuscular injection at a dose of 60 mg, and by intravenous injection at a dose of 60 mg. By these routes, it has a faster onset than when taken orally. The drug is said to taste terrible when smoked, like "burning plastic". DET was initially assumed to be inactive orally similarly to dimethyltryptamine (DMT), but this proved to be incorrect.
The effects of DET have been reported to include similar "illusions" and hallucinations" as DMT, a wave-like time course of effects, closed-eye visuals, open-eye visuals, auditory and olfactory hallucinations, synesthesia, feeling like in another world, cosmic thinking, mystical and philosophical feelings, dream-like mysteriousness of objects, greater emotional significance of objects, peoples' faces seeming "mask-like", enhanced appreciation of art, architecture, and music, feeling like a small child perceiving the world and discovering it anew, time dilation, enjoyment and euphoria, increased empathy, and emotional insights. Additional effects included feeling stoned, alcohol-like intoxication, drifting of thoughts, and difficulty concentrating and cognitive impairment. The effects of the drug were described as highly dependent on set and setting, with prominent negative reactions in unfavorable environments or with too high of doses, including unpleasantness, anxiety, paranoia, social withdrawal, and unwillingness to take the drug again, among others. Physical effects of DET included DMT-like vegetative or autonomic symptoms, pupil dilation, sweating, slight burning and numbness of hands and feet, dizziness, vertigo, feeling sick, paleness, shakiness, muscle tremors, athetoid movements, vomiting, feeling of hollowness in the chest, pronounced tachycardia, pressor effects, and other somatic symptoms. Subsequent-day effects included an afterglow, hangover, lassitude, and cognitive fuzziness.

## Interactions

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

Similarly to other classic psychedelics, DET acts as a non-selective serotonin receptor agonist, including of the serotonin 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, and 5-HT2C receptors. The drug has been shown to activate Gq-mediated signaling at the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor with Emax higher than 70% and to produce the head-twitch response in rodents which is a behavioral proxy of psychedelic-like effects.
DET is a very weak reversible monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI), with IC50Tooltip half-maximal inhibitory concentration values of 59 μM for serotonin and 5,000 μM for tryptamine as substrates. Injections of 30 mg/kg to rats resulted in 67% reduction of brain MAO-A activity 15 minutes after administration. The substance may also act as a serotonin reuptake inhibitor, with low affinity but moderate potency.  It shows no activity as a norepinephrine or dopamine reuptake inhibitor.

### Pharmacokinetics

DET demonstrates significant resistance to metabolism by monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) compared to DMT. This may be due to the increased steric bulk of the N-ethyl substituents relative to the respective methyl groups of DMT which results in metabolic stability sufficient for oral activity. This is also true for many other tryptamines with larger nitrogen substituents. 
The drug similarly to DMT is rapidly absorbed from the intraperitoneal cavity and quickly distributed through plasma, liver and brain. Most of the substance had disappeared from the aforementioned tissues 30 minutes from administration, except in the brain, where it could still be detected at 60 minutes. 
Likewise to DMT the substance is metabolized through 6-hydroxylation and N-dealkylation to form the corresponding intermediates. These metabolites were found to be excreted in urine of about 20% of the administered dose as the glucoronide conjugate, of which the parent compound can be detected by chromatographic analysis at low concentrations (3–5%). Hepatic 6-hydroxylation of the indole ring, yields a minor, psychoactively inactive metabolite 6-hydroxy-DET (6-HO-DET) in similar concentration, with additional hydroxylation possible at alternative positions. Repeated administration of DET, or second exposure one to two weeks after the first, resulted in significant metabolic changes. The unchanged drug excreted after a later exposure was significantly lower, while the excretion of the metabolites which were measured in this case were higher than at the first exposure to DET.

## Chemistry

DET, also known as N,N-diethyltryptamine, is a synthetic compound in the tryptamine class, structurally related to the endogenous neurotransmitter serotonin and the naturally occurring psychedelic compounds dimethyltryptamine (DMT) and dipropyltryptamine (DPT). It is the ethyl analogue of DMT.

### Synthesis

The chemical synthesis of DET has been described.

### Analogues

Analogues of DET include dimethyltryptamine (DMT), dipropyltryptamine (DPT), methylethyltryptamine (MET), methylpropyltryptamine (MPT), ethylpropyltryptamine (EPT), 4-HO-DET, 5-HO-DET, 6-HO-DET, 4-AcO-DET, ethocybin (4-PO-DET or CEY-19), 6F-DET, and 2-Me-DET.

## History

DET was first synthesized and administered intramuscularly in a 60 mg dose by Stephen Szára in 1956. It was subsequently described in his material published in 1957. More systematic studies were reported later by Szara and colleagues and independently by Böszörményi and colleagues. Early research began as a search for "psychosis mimics" in psychiatry, then expanded into broader psychedelic and structure–activity studies. Selection of study subjects for some of these studies was criticized by Alexander Shulgin in his 1997 book TiHKAL (Tryptamines I Have Known and Loved) for its "oppressive research environment". For many years, based on early clinical reports and private communications, Shulgin maintained that DET exhibited psychoactive effects only when administered via parenteral routes. He eventually revised his view, ultimately acknowledging that the substance is also orally active. 
Initially, DET was not classified as a controlled substance, and some early clinical and experimental psychopharmacological research used it without scheduling restrictions. By the late 1960s and early 1970s, however, increasing regulatory attention led to tighter controls and this led to DET getting placed in Schedule I internationally by the Convention on Psychotropic Substances.
Modern research on DET remains limited compared to dimethyltryptamine (DMT), due to its status as a controlled substance and the predominance of focus on other tryptamines with greater prevalence in traditional or clinical contexts. Most recent studies and reviews refer to DET primarily in comparative molecular pharmacology, assessing its receptor binding and signaling at serotonin receptors.

## Society and culture

### Legal status

#### International

DET is listed under Schedule I of the United Nations 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances, placing it under international control. This means that countries that are parties to the Convention are required to regulate DET production, distribution, and use, restricting it to scientific and very limited medical purposes. Possession and trade of DET without appropriate authorization is prohibited under international law.

#### Australia

DET is considered a Schedule 9 prohibited substance in Australia under the Poisons Standard (October 2015). A Schedule 9 substance is a substance which may be abused or misused, the manufacture, possession, sale or use of which should be prohibited by law except when required for medical or scientific research, or for analytical, teaching or training purposes with approval of Commonwealth and/or State or Territory Health Authorities.

#### Germany

## Research

### Psychosis model

Early studies of DET as well as other psychedelics were focused on their presumed psychotomimetic properties. Researchers theorized that abnormal metabolites of endogenous chemicals such as tryptamine, serotonin, and tryptophan could be the explanation for mental disorders such as schizophrenia, or psychosis. DET, along with other synthetic psychedelics, was administered to both patients and healthy volunteers to understand its effects and as a possible biological model for psychosis. With the progression of science and pharmacological understanding, this belief has been dismissed by most researchers.

### Mushroom production

Although DET is a synthetic compound with no known natural sources, it has been used in conjunction with the mycelium of Psilocybe cubensis to biosynthetically produce the chemicals ethocybin (4-PO-DET) and ethocin (4-HO-DET). Isolation of the alkaloids resulted in 3.3% ethocybin and 0.01-0.8% ethocin.
