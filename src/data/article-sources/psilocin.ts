(Mushrooms)

Psilocin is a naturally occurring tryptamine psychedelic found within approximately 190 separate species of mushroom and growing on every continent across the planet. Psychedelic mushrooms have been in use since before recorded human history with their depiction being found on cave art and famously used by the native people of Mesoamerica for religious and shamanic purposes.

There are two separate chemicals found within mushrooms in roughly equal amounts. They are both classed as substituted tryptamine alkaloids and serotonergic psychedelic drugs, but it’s important to note that only psilocin is directly active. The other substance, psilocybin, is instead a pro-drug of the pharmacologically active substance psilocin and converted directly into it within the liver. Once the molecule has been converted into psilocin, it acts as a partial agonist for several serotonergic receptors. Psilocin has a high affinity for the 5-HT2A serotonin receptor in the brain where it mimics the effects of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, or 5-HT).

The psilocin experience contains a complex and wide array of effects which based on the predefined potential subjective effects index found [here](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effects_index), I will now begin to breakdown and describe the chemical.

**Physical Effects:**

The physical effects of Psilocin can be broken down into two components all of which progressively intensify proportional to dosage. These are described below and generally include:

- **Spontaneous tactile sensations** - The body high of psilocin can be described as a pleasurable, warm, soft and all-encompassing tingling sensation. This maintains a consistent presence that steadily rises with the onset and hits its limit once the peak has been reached.
- **Sedation** - In terms of its effects on the physical energy levels of the tripper, psilocin is considered by most to be relaxing, stoning and mildly sedating. This sense of sedation is often accompanied by compulsive yawning, a runny nose and watering eyes.

**Cognitive Effects:**

The head space of psilocin is described by many as extremely relaxing, profound and stoning in its style when compared to other commonly used psychedelics such as LSD or 2C-B which tend to be energetic and stimulating. It contains a large number of psychedelic typical and unique cognitive effects.

The most prominent of these typical effects generally include:

- **Enhancement of current mind state**
- **Connectivity of thought**
- **Feelings of fascination, importance and awe**
- **Time distortion**
- **Outrospection 
**
- **Deja-Vu**
- **Removal of cultural filter**
- **Feelings of predeterminism**
- **Conceptual thinking**
- **Direct communication with the subconsious**
- **Ego suppression, loss and death**
- **Feelings of interdependent opposites**
- **Delusions**
- **States of unity and interconnectedness**
- **Enhancement and suppression cycles - **This can be described as constant waves of extremely stimulated and profound thinking which are spontaneously surpassed in a cyclic fashion by waves of general thought suppression and mental intoxication. These two states seem to switch between each other in a consistent loop once every 20 - 60 minutes.

**Visual Effects:**

*Enhancements*

Psilocin presents a full and complete array of possible visual enhancements which generally include:

- **Increased visual acuity**
- **Enhancement of colours**
- **Enhanced pattern recognition**

*Distortions*

As for visual distortions and alterations, effects experienced are detailed below:

- **Visual drifting** (*melting, flowing, breathing and morphing*) - In comparison to other psychedelics, this effect can be described as highly detailed, slow and smooth in motion and static in its appearance.
- **Tracers**
- **After images**
- **Texture repetition**
- **Colour shifting**
- **Scenery slicing**

*Geometry*

The visual geometry that is present throughout this trip can be described as more similar in appearance to that of 4-AcO-DMT, Ayahuasca and 2C-E than LSD. It can be comprehensively described as structured in its organization, organic in geometric style, intricate in complexity, large in size, fast and smooth in motion, colourful in scheme, glossy in colour, blurred in its edges and rounded in its corners. They have a very “natural” feel to them and at higher dosages are significantly more likely to result in states of Level 7B visual geometry over Level 7A.

*Hallucinatory States*

Psilocin and its various other forms produce a full range of high level hallucinatory states in a fashion that is more consistent and reproducible than that of many other commonly used psychedelics. These effects generally include:

- **External hallucinations**
- **Internal hallucinations** - This particular effect commonly contains hallucinations with scenarios, landscapes, settings, concepts and autonomous entity contact. They are more common within dark environments and can be described as internal in their manifestation, lucid in believability, interactive in style and almost exclusively of religious, spiritual, mystical or a transcendental nature in their overall theme.

**Auditory Effects:**

The auditory effects of psilocin are common in their occurrence and exhibit a full range of effects which commonly include:

- **Enhancements**
- **Distortions**
- **Hallucinations**

**Health Effects, Addiction Potential and Tolerance:**

The toxicity of psilocybin, psilacetin and psilocin is extremely low. In rats, the median lethal dose (LD50) of psilocybin when administered orally is 280 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg). Psilocybin comprises approximately 1% of the weight of Psilocybe cubensis mushrooms, so nearly 1.7 kilograms (3.7 lb) of dried mushrooms or 17 kilograms (37 lb) of fresh mushrooms would be required for a 60-kilogram (130 lb) person to reach the 280 mg/kg LD50 value of rats. Based on the results of animal studies, the lethal dose of psilocybin has been extrapolated to be 6 grams which is 1000 times greater than the effective dose of 6 milligrams.

There are no known long term physical effects from ingestion of mushrooms containing psilocybin and psilocin.

Keep in mind that psychedelic mushrooms are non-habit-forming and that the desire to use them can actually decrease with use. They are most often self-regulating. You also build an almost immediate tolerance to them after ingestion, preventing you from experiencing their full effects for more often than every 4-7 days (unless you increase your dose significantly). 

**Legal issues:**

- Psilocybin mushrooms are regulated or prohibited in many countries, often carrying severe legal penalties (for example, the U.S. Psychotropic Substances Act, the UK Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 and Drugs Act 2005 and the Canadian Controlled Drugs and Substances Act).
- Psilocybin and psilocin are listed as Schedule I drugs under the United Nations 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances.
- On November 29, 2008, the Netherlands announced it would ban the cultivation and use of psilocybin-containing fungi beginning December 1, 2008.
- The UK ban on fresh mushrooms (dried ones were already illegal as they were considered a psilocybin-containing preparation) was introduced in 2005.
- The New Mexico appeals court ruled on June 14, 2005, that growing psilocybin mushrooms for personal consumption could not be considered “manufacturing a controlled substance” under state law. However it still remains illegal under federal law.
- 4-ACO-DMT is unscheduled in the United States. It may be considered an analog of psilocin under the Federal Analog Act.
- 4-ACO-DMT could also be considered illegal in the UK under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971. 4-ACO-DMT is an ester of psilocin (to which it metabolizes into). This means that it potentially carries the same penalty as any Class A drug.

If you want to try psilocin despite the legal issues you have multiple options. You can purchase them through a street dealer, grow them yourself using this guide here or you can pick them fresh in your local area during the correct season if you know where to look for them.
If you want to try 4-ACO-DMT despite the legal issues, you can find it for sale through the power of Google. It sold online to the masses through various research chemical vendors who I cannot legally mention the names of.

**Conclusion:**

Psilocin is one of my favourite psychedelics and is best used in silent darkness and in high doses to fully release its hallucinatory effects. Mushrooms are slightly more capable of producing bad trips in people who are inexperienced with psychedelics as they can be a little more confusing. However, they are extremely rewarding in terms of head space, allowing for extremely deep philosophical thoughts and realizations that I have not found with any other substance.

## SYNTHESIS
A suspension of 0.38 g LAH in 10 mL anhydrous THF was held in an inert atmosphere and vigorously stirred. To this there was added, dropwise, a solution of 0.55 g of 4-acetoxyindol-3-yl-N,N-dimethylglyoxylamide in 10 mL anhydrous THF at a rate that maintained a gentle reflux. After the addition was complete, the refluxing was maintained for an additional 15 min, the reaction mixture cooled to 40 Â°C, and the excess hydride destroyed by the addition of water diluted with a little THF. The reaction mixture was filtered free of insoluble material under a N2 atmosphere, the resulting solids washed with THF. The filtrate and washings were combined and stripped of solvent under vacuum. The residue was distilled in a KugelRohr apparatus and the solid distillate recrystallized allized from EtOAc/hexane to give 3-[2-(dimethylamino)ethyl]-4-indolol (4-HO-DMT, psilocin) as white crystals which, after recrystallization from ethyl acetate/hexane, had a mp of 103â104 Â°C. The final weight was 0.23 g (yield 56%). IR (in cm-1): 686, 725, 832, 991, 1040 and 1055; the OH stretch is at 3240. MS (in m/z): C3H8N+ 58 (100%); parent ion 204 (15%); indolemethylene+ 146 (3%); 159 (2%).

Most of the early syntheses of psilocin and psilocybin employ the O-benzyl ether as a protecting group. This provides more stability to the chemical intermediates, but also requires the additional step of reductive debenzylation. The flow chart of this process is: conversion of 4-hydroxyindole to 4-benzyloxyindole via the sodium salt, with benzyl chloride; the conversion of this with oxalyl chloride to 4-benzyloxyindole-3-glyoxylchloride; the conversion of this to 4-benzyloxy-3-(N,N-dimethyl-glyoxamide with anhydrous dimethylamine; the conversion of this to 4-benzyloxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine with LAH in dioxane; and finally the conversion of this to 4-HO-DMT (psilocin) with hydrogen with a Pd catalyst on Al2O3. The phosphate ester, psilocybin, requires two additional steps: the conversion of 4-HO-DMT (as the sodium salt) to 4-(O,O-dibenzylphosphoryloxy)-N,N-dimethyltryptamine, with dibenzyl chlorophosphonate, followed by the catalytic removal of the benzyl groups with hydrogen and Pd on Al2O3 to give the phosphate ester of 4-HO-DMT (psilocybin). This product is much more stable in air than psilocin, and is water soluble. The yields of this conversion are, however, very bad, often less than 10%, and the two products appear to be pharmacologically equivalent. Further, I have heard that the phosphorylating agent dibenzyl chlorophosphonate must always be used in solution as it is quite unstable as a pure reagent. The fingerprint infra-red spectrum for psilocybin shows (in cm-1): 752, 789, 806, 858, 925 and the P=O stretch at 1110; the acidic OH stretches are broad peaks at 2400, 2700 and 3200. The mass spectrum is identical to that of psilocin.


## DOSAGE

## DURATION

## QUALITATIVE COMMENTS
(with 7 mg, orally) âBasically I am not in a pleasant placeâquite neuroticâinwardly turnedâa touch of despairâconsiderable visual activity and if I were with someone I might find some sort of reinforcement. The apathy and unpleasantness is ebbing now. My mood might have been negative, and the psilocybin simply amplified everything. There was some intensification of the lights and darks around me.â

(with 10 mg, orally) âApproximately forty minutes after the start, there was a flutter and a very high, stimulated feeling, and gradually things began to move very rapidly. It was astounding. When I closed my eyes I saw so many fantastically beautiful patterns, textures, colors. Everywhere I looked, eyes open, the colors were brilliant. The house looked absolutely gorgeous and nature was simply spectacular. It was a little frightening, almost too exciting, after the gentleness of other substances. I could not believe that I was doing it, and that I had the power within myself to see such beauty. I donât know how long this went on but the motion was so rapid that I felt a sort of motion sickness. Then I became quite nauseated and remained nauseated the rest of the day, until things quieted down in the evening, and then I felt absolutely wonderful.â

(with 15 mg, orally) âMy âearly warning systemâ alerted me at fifteen minutes, then all was quiet for a while. I start building up again, and I am awfully glad that I am familiar with this transition. Visual distortions. Things distract me. I canât find the cap to my penâmust I keep writing forever? At this point I couldnât drive, let alone write, and it is just a bit more than a half hour since I took it. The furniture in my office is moving up and down. I lie down, and close my eyes. THIS is where it is at. Visuals are wild. Even with eyes open, with no visual target, there are imaginative visual effects. I imagine a dark room with a fire place going in the middle of the night, with no other inputs, and with my eyes closed I have the body image of being seated in front of that fire and I am amazed by the hallucinations and distortions I am seeing there only there is no fireplace as I am still lying in my darkened bedroom. Sort of a 2Ã removed hallucination. This is a night-time drugâthe day-light washes everything out. I tried but could not repeat the fireplace thing, and must be dropping rapidly. At three hours I ask if I would try some other experiment. OK, but there are some reservations. At four hours, no reservations.â

(with 15 mg, orally) "As soon as I felt the chill and the alert, I lay down and closed my eyes. Indian motif. Abundant fruits, vegetables, leaves, straw, wood, vines. Very responsive sexually. Beautiful, stern, rich encounter with livingness and Indian Gods and serenity. Color and peacefulness. A couple of hours, then elaborateness dropped slightly. At this point top of temple easy, but it was a South American temple, with earth floor, straw, vines full of fruit. Familiar feeling. We are naked and we are children-adults, daring to be there, regarded benignly (stern, amused) (rising through the floor). This is one of the true ones, this plant experience.

(with 12 mg phosphate ester, intramuscularly) âThis is strong. There were a lot of wild images in about two hours, and I thought that the day would never end. At about six hours I knew it would, but in fact in the evening I took 100 milligrams of Seconal which allowed me to drift into a fine sleep. The next day I was fine.â

(with 3 mg phosphate ester, intravenously) âThe effects are immediate (in 30 seconds) and I did not have the time to build up any worryâit was simply too fast. In about an hour I was back where I started from.â

(with 12 mg phosphate ester, intravenously) âI had had eight milligrams earlier, with a very good reaction. Here, today, I feel that everything has disintegrated, and I am extremely anxious. I am very confused.â

Psilocybe cubensis: (with 1.5 g, orally) âAt best, some speckled patterning with my eyes closed, and in general a light intoxication. Certainly not the sparkle of LSD. Dropped quickly and felt heavy and tired, good sleep.â

(with 3.5 g, orally) âTook a gram to start with, and it started in ten minutes, but not strong enough, so did the other 2.5 grams. Everything was coming at me in waves, boxing me in, the visuals were in waves and in dark earth colors, orange and brown, not the wide spectrum of acid. I was sea-sick, and vomiting helps some, and a little dope quieted the tummy. Started dropping, and everything became very good, and by midnight I was out. No hangover at all.â


## EXTENSIONS AND COMMENTARY
The second generalization is more difficult and leads into some uncomfortable areas. This is the effort to equate the chemicals, psilocin and psilocybin, with their natural sources, the mushrooms. Part of the uncertainties I feel are related to the unknowns that are intrinsic to the plant sources. There are many species that have been offered and accepted as magic mushrooms. Identification in the field is one thing, but what can be said of dried, ground up plant material of unknown sources? What are they? How have they been preserved? What is their composition? The older samples may be reasonably free of the rather unstable psilocin, but psilocybin is much more stable and may persist. But so might its congeners such as baeocystin and norbaeocystin which are scattered in widely different proportions in many species, and which are quite unexplored pharmacologically. The same instablity certainly applies to the dephosphoralated psilocin analogues 4-HO-NMT and 4-HO-T. There are so many uncontrollable variables in the mushroom area that here I cast my vote for exploration with the chemicals themselves. They can, at least in principle, be analyzed, and weighed. But this is a luxury not available to many, as the syntheses of these alkaloids is difficult, and woefully illegal.

Which brings us back to the mushrooms, and the topic of the law. In the original writing of the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, our Federal drug law, there are only four plants listed as being âScheduled Drugs.â In Schedule I there was Marijuana (later defined as the plant Cannabis spp.) and Peyote (later defined as the botanical Lophophora williamsii); in Schedule II there was Opium poppy and poppy straw, and Coca leaves. It is generally known that commercial opium comes from the plant Papaver somniferum and that commercial coca comes from the plant Erythroxylon coca, but I am not aware of either of these botanical binomials having been explicitly named in the statutes. A couple of quickies were slipped in, not completely properly, in the giving of the binomial of Tabernanthe iboga as a synonym for ibogaine, and the giving of the binomial of Catha edulis as a synonym for cathinone, both Schedule I drugs. So there are definitely four, and maybe six, plants that can be considered Scheduled drugs.

But nowhere in the legal archives of current drug statutes can you find mention of Genera such as Psilocybe, Stropharia, Paneolus or Inocybe. Nor of the dozens and dozens of species that stem from them. So, you would logically conclude that these magic mushroom are not illegal? Well, yes and no.

No, in the letter-of-the-law sense that they are not explicitly named as illegal entities. But yes, in the de facto exercise of the law. With the inescapable fact that both psilocin and psilocybin are named as Schedule I drugs, and the acknowledgment that there are some mushrooms that might contain these drugs, then these botanical entities become legal complications. Might the dried fruiting bodies be seen as packaging strategy for the sale and delivery of a Scheduled I drug? Might the growing of them be seen as a production strategy for the manufacture of a Schedule I drug? Of course it might be, as the law has stated that the manufacture and sale of Schedule I drugs is a Federal felony. âYour Honor. I gathered these things out there in the field for my dinner salad. I had no idea that they contained something illegal.â A reasonable defense, and it may well work today, along with the argument that opium poppy pods are buyable at the Farmerâs Market as floral decorations, and morning glory seeds can be bought at the local nursery for next Springâs garden. Innocence may be a virtue for a while, as it is not widely recognized that these decorative poppies are in fact Schedule II opium capsules and those Ipomoea seeds in fact contain ergine, a Schedule III depressant. But that is today. What happens tomorrow?

Today, to a large measure, the burden of proof still falls upon the accuser, and that ephemeral and undocumented âpresumption of innocenceâ concept provides some measure of protection. They, the accusers accusors, must prove you are guilty. But, as the legal structure drifts from the criminal statutes to the regulatory statutes, this protection is lost. You must prove that you are innocent. The perfect example is the random urine test, which demands, without any probable cause, that you prove that you do not have drugs in you. There is no presumption of innocence. This has been the sad state of our income tax laws for years, and now it is becoming a reality in our drug laws. Prove to the court that you didnât know that these mushrooms were psychoactive! Shades of the Inquisitions of a few hundred years ago. Or the Salem travesties of more recent times. Prove to us you are not a witch.

There is quite a body of scientific literature that discusses the changes (increases and well as decreases) of psilocybin and psilocin content in mushrooms as a function of their nutrient diet. And, under the 4-HO-DET entry, I mentioned that the inclusion of an unnatural component into the diet just might produce an unnatural alkaloidal product, with an exploitation of the natural and available enzyme systems that are part of the mycelial structure.

Another aside. There is a trivial, and fun, bit of nomenclature which I have used for years. I have, in my notes, referred to psilocybin as PSOP (because of the phosphate thing) and psilocin as PSOH (because of the exposed OH group). I have gotten into the habit of referring to the acetate as PSOA, the O-methyl ether as PSOM and the chemical intermediate O-benzyl ether as PSOB. I know that this will never catch on, but I still do it because it is convenient and a bit campy. One code that is not mine, but Sandozâs, is CMY for 1-methyl-psilocin. I know it has been looked at in a clinical environment, but I have no not idea as to its activity. It is a simple thing to make. I would love to know what it does.

Psilocin, also known as 4-hydroxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (4-HO-DMT), is a psychedelic drug and fungal alkaloid of the tryptamine and 4-hydroxytryptamine families. Along with its phosphate ester psilocybin, it is found in most species of psilocybin-containing mushrooms, such as Psilocybe cubensis and Psilocybe mexicana, and is the compound responsible for their hallucinogenic effects, although concentrations of psilocin are variably lower than those of psilocybin. The drug is taken orally and its effects include perceptual changes and visual effects, emotional changes, ego dissolution, time dilation, and mystical experiences, among others. Psilocybin, as well as synthetic acyl esters such as 4-AcO-DMT (psilacetin; O-acetylpsilocin) and 4-PrO-DMT (O-propionylpsilocin), are prodrugs of psilocin and have similar properties and effects.
Psilocin acts as a non-selective serotonin receptor agonist, including of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor among others. The drug produces its hallucinogenic effects specifically via activation of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor. However, other serotonin receptors, such as the serotonin 5-HT1A and 5-HT2C receptors, may also contribute to its effects. Notable analogues of psilocin include dimethyltryptamine (DMT), its positional isomer bufotenin (5-HO-DMT), its higher homologue 4-HO-MET (metocin), and others.
Psilocin and psilocybin were discovered via isolation from psilocybin-containing mushrooms by Albert Hofmann in 1958. This followed the Western re-discovery of psilocybin-containing mushrooms by Robert Gordon Wasson and Valentina Pavlovna Wasson in Mexico in 1955. Psilocin, in the form of psilocybin, psilocybin-containing mushrooms, and other prodrugs such as 4-AcO-DMT, is a widely used entheogen as well as recreational psychedelic drug. Psilocybin and psilocin became controlled substances in the United States and internationally under the United Nations in 1971. Since then, psilocin, as the active form of psilocybin, has become of interest for potential use in medicine to treat psychiatric disorders such as depression. Psilocybin was approved for such purposes in Australia in 2023 and is in late-stage clinical trials in the United States and other countries.

## Use and effects

Psilocin is used recreationally, spirituality or shamanically, and medically. It is most commonly used in the form of its prodrugs such as psilocybin and 4-AcO-DMT (psilacetin). However, psilocin may also be used itself, either in the form of psilocybin-containing mushrooms (which variably contain psilocin up to similar amounts as psilocybin) or in synthetic form.
Psilocin is usually used orally, but may also be taken intravenously. In terms of dose, it is slightly more potent than psilocybin, about 1.4-fold so (i.e., 1.4 mg psilocybin equals about 1.0 mg psilocin). This is related to psilocin's lack of ester prodrug moiety, which results in its molecular weight being about 40% lower than that of psilocybin (204 g/mol and 284 g/mol, respectively). The human dose of psilocin has been given as 10 to 20 mg orally.
In his book TiHKAL (Tryptamines I Have Known and Loved), Alexander Shulgin described the properties and effects of psilocin, either as psilocin itself, as a prodrug like psilocybin or 4-AcO-DMT, or as Psilocybe cubensis mushrooms. The dose, regardless of form, was listed as 10 to 20 mg orally and the duration as 3 to 6 hours. The onset, in the case of psilocin specifically, was 15 to 40 minutes. The perceptual and related effects included brightened colors, increased visual contrast, closed-eye visuals such as patterns, textures, and colors, open-eye visuals such as colors, distortions, and movement, pareidolia, increased appreciation of scenery, perceiving beauty, and enhanced imagination. Other effects variably included feeling intoxicated, high, and/or stimulated, feelings of peacefulness and serenity, emotional amplification, mood swings, feelings of neuroticism and introversion, feelings of despair, apathy, and unpleasantness, anxiety, confusion, distractibility, impairment, and feeling heavy and tired. Side effects included chills, nausea, vomiting, and motion sickness, but no hangover.
In other reports, the effects observed after ingestion of psilocin can include but are not limited to tachycardia, dilated pupils, restlessness or arousal, euphoria, open and closed eye visuals (common at medium to high doses), synesthesia (e.g. hearing colors and seeing sounds), increased body temperature, headache, sweating and chills, and nausea.

## Contraindications

## Side effects

There has been no direct lethality associated with psilocin. There has been no reported withdrawal syndrome when chronic use of this drug is ceased.  There is cross tolerance among psilocin, mescaline, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), and other psychedelics due to downregulation of these receptors.

## Overdose

## Interactions

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

Psilocin is the pharmacologically active agent in the body after ingestion of psilocybin or some species of psychedelic mushrooms. Psilocybin is rapidly dephosphorylated in the body to psilocin which acts as a serotonin 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C and 5-HT1A receptor agonist or partial agonist. Psilocin exhibits functional selectivity in that it activates phospholipase A2 instead of activating phospholipase C as the endogenous ligand serotonin does. Psilocin is structurally similar to serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine), differing only by the hydroxyl group being on the 4-position rather than the 5 and the dimethyl groups on the nitrogen. Its effects are thought to come from its agonist activity at 5-HT2A receptors in the prefrontal cortex. Psilocin's psychedelic effects are directly correlated with the drug's occupancy at these receptor sites. The drug shows pronounced biased agonism at the serotonin 5-HT2C receptor. Psilocin has no significant effect on dopamine receptors only affects the noradrenergic system at very high doses.
Psilocin has been reported to act as a highly potent positive allosteric modulator of the tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB), one of the receptors of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). However, subsequent studies failed to reproduce these findings and instead found no interaction of psilocin with TrkB.
The cryo-EM structures of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor with psilocin, as well as with various other psychedelics and serotonin 5-HT2A receptor agonists, have been solved and published by Bryan L. Roth and colleagues.

### Pharmacokinetics

Psilocin's elimination half-life ranges from 1 to 3 hours depending on route of administration of psilocybin.

## Chemistry

Psilocin, also known as 4-hydroxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (4-HO-DMT), is a tryptamine derivative. It is closely structurally related to the neurotransmitter serotonin (which is 5-hydroxytryptamine, also known as 5-HT or 5-HO-T), as well as to the naturally occurring psychedelics dimethyltryptamine (N,N-dimethyltryptamine; DMT) and bufotenin (5-hydroxy-N,N-DMT; 5-HO-DMT). Psilocybin is psilocin's O-phosphate ester (4-phosphoryloxy-N,N-DMT; 4-PO-DMT).

### Synthesis

The chemical synthesis of psilocin has been described. It can be obtained by dephosphorylation of psilocybin under strongly acidic or under alkaline conditions (hydrolysis). A synthetic route uses the Speeter–Anthony tryptamine synthesis procedure. First, 4-hydroxyindole is Friedel-Crafts-acylated with oxalyl chloride in position 3. The compound is further reacted with dimethylamine, yielding the indole-3-yl-glyoxamide. Finally, this 4-hydroxyindole-3-N,N-dimethylglyoxamide is reduced by lithium aluminum hydride yielding psilocin.

### Stability

Psilocin is relatively unstable in solution due to its phenolic hydroxy (-OH) group. In the presence of oxygen, it readily forms bluish and dark black degradation products. Similar products are also formed in the presence of oxygen and Fe3+ ions.

### Analogues

Analogues of psilocin (4-HO-DMT) include dimethyltryptamine (DMT), 4-hydroxytryptamine (4-HT or 4-HO-T), norpsilocin (4-HO-NMT), 4-HO-TMT, 4-HO-MET (metocin), 4-HO-DET (ethocin), 4-HO-MPT (meprocin), 4-HO-DPT (deprocin), 4-HO-MiPT (miprocin), 4-HO-DiPT (diprocin), 4-MeO-DMT, and 5-MeO-DMT, among others.
A number of ester prodrugs of psilocin are known, such as psilocybin (4-PO-DMT), 4-AcO-DMT, and 4-PrO-DMT. Psilocybin is the O-phosphate ester of psilocin, while 4-AcO-DMT is the O-acetyl ester and 4-PrO-DMT is the O-propionyl ester. Another ester is 4-GO-DMT (4-HO-DMT O-glutarate; RE109), which is related to luvesilocin (4-GO-DiPT; RE104). Analogues of psilocin prodrugs include norbaeocystin (4-PO-T), baeocystin (4-PO-NMT), aeruginascin (4-PO-TMT), and ethocybin (4-PO-DET), among others.
Bufotenin (5-HO-DMT), 6-HO-DMT, and 7-HO-DMT are positional isomers of psilocin.
1-Methylpsilocin is a serotonin 5-HT2C receptor-preferring agonist. 4-Fluoro-DMT is known. Another analogue of psilocin is 1-isopropyl-6-fluoropsilocin (O-4310).
Sulfur analogues of psilocin are known with a benzothienyl replacement as well as 4-SH-DMT.

## History

Psilocin and its phosphorylated cousin, psilocybin, were first isolated and named in 1958 by Swiss chemist Albert Hofmann. He obtained the chemicals from laboratory-grown specimens of the hallucinogenic mushroom Psilocybe mexicana. Hofmann also succeeded in finding synthetic routes to these chemicals.

## Society and culture

### Legal status

#### United Nations

Psilocin is a Schedule I drug under the Convention on Psychotropic Substances. The United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances (adopted in 1971) requires its members to prohibit psilocybin, and parties to the treaty are required to restrict the use of the drug to medical and scientific research under strictly controlled conditions.

#### Australia

Psilocin is considered a Schedule 9 prohibited substance in Australia under the Poisons Standard (October 2015). A Schedule 9 substance is a substance which may be abused or misused, the manufacture, possession, sale or use of which should be prohibited by law except when required for medical or scientific research, or for analytical, teaching or training purposes with approval of Commonwealth and/or State or Territory Health Authorities.

#### Russia

Psilocin and psilocybin are banned in Russia, due to their status as narcotic drugs, with a criminal penalty for possession of more than 50 mg.

#### United States

Psilocin is a Schedule I controlled substance in the United States since 1971.

## Research

Psilocin is being evaluated under the developmental code name PLZ-1015 for the treatment of pervasive developmental disorders like autism in children. Its prodrug psilocybin is also being studied for treatment of depression and a variety of other conditions.
