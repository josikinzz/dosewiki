## Overview

### Description

This compound belongs to the class of organic compounds known as alpha amino acid amides. These are amide derivatives of alpha amino acids.

### Background

Lisdexamfetamine is a prodrug of
dextroamphetamine
, a central nervous system stimulant known as d-amphetamine,
3
covalently attached to the naturally occurring amino acid L-lysine.
1
Lisdexamfetamine is the first chemically formulated prodrug stimulant
3
and was first approved by the FDA in April 2008.
1
It was also approved by Health Canada in February 2009.
7
Lisdexamfetamine works to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and binge eating disorder
1
by blocking dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake and increasing their levels in the extraneuronal space.
6

### Indication

Lisdexamfetamine is indicated for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adults and pediatric patients six years and older. It is also indicated to treat moderate to severe binge eating disorder (BED) in adults.
6
,
7
It is approved for use in the US and Canada.

### Pharmacodynamics

Once administered, lisdexamfetamine is converted to its active metabolite, dextroamphetamine, which is taken up by the brain. Dextroamphetamine blocks the reuptake of norepinephrine and dopamine into the presynaptic neuron and increases the release of these monoamines into the extraneuronal space. The parent drug, lisdexamfetamine, does not bind to the sites responsible for the reuptake of norepinephrine and dopamine in vitro.
6

### Mechanism of Action

Trace amine-associated receptor 1
Agonist

### Absorption

After oral administration, lisdexamfetamine dimesylate is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract.
3
,
7
Following single-dose oral administration of lisdexamfetamine in pediatric patients with ADHD under fasted conditions, T
max
of lisdexamfetamine and dextroamphetamine was reached at approximately one hour and 3.5 hours post-dose, respectively. Weight/Dose normalized AUC and C
max
values were the same in pediatric patients as the adults. Food prolongs T
max
by approximately one hour and may decrease the exposure (C
max
and AUC) of dextroamphetamine.
6

### Metabolism

Lisdexamfetamine dimesylate is hydrolyzed by red blood cells to dextroamphetamine and l-lysine primarily in the blood. Substantial hydrolysis occurs even at low hematocrit levels.
3
,
4
,
6
Dextroamphetamine can further be metabolized to form other metabolites, such as hippuric acid.
5
Lisdexamfetamine is not metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes.

### Half-life

Plasma concentrations of unconverted lisdexamfetamine are low and transient, generally becoming non-quantifiable by 8 hours after administration. The plasma elimination half-life of lisdexamfetamine typically averaged less than one hour in volunteers ages six years and older. The plasma elimination half-life of dextroamphetamine was approximately 8.6 to 9.5 hours in pediatric patients six to 12 years and 10 to 11.3 hours in healthy adults.
6

### Toxicity

The LD
50
value for lisdexamfetamine dihydrochloride in rats was >1000 mg/kg.
7
Manifestations of amphetamine overdose include restlessness, tremor, hyperreflexia, rapid respiration, confusion, assaultiveness, hallucinations, panic states, hyperpyrexia and rhabdomyolysis. Fatigue and depression usually follow the central nervous system stimulation. Serotonin syndrome has been reported with amphetamine use, including lisdexamfetamine. Cardiovascular effects include arrhythmias, hypertension or hypotension and circulatory collapse. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Convulsions and coma usually precede fatal poisoning. Lisdexamfetamine and d-amphetamine are not dialyzable.

### Drug Interactions

This information should not be interpreted without the help of a healthcare provider. If you believe you are experiencing an interaction, contact a healthcare provider immediately. The absence of an interaction does not necessarily mean no interactions exist.

Abiraterone
The serum concentration of dextroamphetamine, an active metabolite of Lisdexamfetamine, can be increased when used in combination with Abiraterone.
Acebutolol
The serum concentration of dextroamphetamine, an active metabolite of Lisdexamfetamine, can be increased when used in combination with Acebutolol.
Aceclofenac
The risk or severity of hypertension can be increased when Lisdexamfetamine is combined with Aceclofenac.
Acemetacin
The risk or severity of hypertension can be increased when Lisdexamfetamine is combined with Acemetacin.
Acetazolamide
Acetazolamide may decrease the excretion rate of Lisdexamfetamine which could result in a higher serum level.

### Food Interactions

Avoid antacids. Urinary excretion of lisdexamfetamine is elevated when the urine is more acidic. Antacids like sodium bicarbonate alkalinize the urine; therefore, they may reduce lisdexamfetamine elimination.
Limit foods and supplements high in vitamin C. Urinary excretion of lisdexamfetamine is elevated when the urine is more acidic. Vitamin C acidifies the urine and, therefore, may increase lisdexamfetamine elimination.
Take with or without food. Food prolongs Tmax by approximately one hour, but does not significantly affect drug exposure.

### Mechanism of action

Lisdexamfetamine is a prodrug of dextroamphetamine, which is a noncatecholamine sympathomimetic amine with CNS stimulant activity. Dextroamphetamine is a known inhibitor of the dopamine transporter (DAT), noradrenaline transporter (NET) and vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2), with a weaker affinity for the serotonin transporter (SERT). It is also a weak monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor.
4
Dextroamphetamine ultimately blocks the reuptake of norepinephrine and dopamine into the presynaptic neuron and increases catecholamine availability in the extracellular space.
6
The exact mode of therapeutic action of lisdexamfetamine in ADHD and BED has not been fully elucidated; however, the clinical effects of lisdexamfetamine are believed to be linked to the pharmacological actions of dextroamphetamine.

### Route of elimination

Following oral administration of a 70 mg dose of radiolabeled lisdexamfetamine dimesylate in six healthy subjects, approximately 96% of the oral dose radioactivity was recovered in the urine, and only 0.3% recovered in the feces over 120 hours. Of the radioactivity recovered in the urine, 42% of the dose was related to amphetamine, 25% to hippuric acid, and 2% to intact lisdexamfetamine.

### General Function

Electrogenic proton-coupled amino-acid transporter that transports oligopeptides of 2 to 4 amino acids with a preference for dipeptides. Transports neutral and monovalently charged peptides with a proton to peptide stoichiometry of 1:1 or 2:1 (By similarity) (PubMed:15521010, PubMed:18367661, PubMed:19685173, PubMed:26320580, PubMed:7896779, PubMed:8914574, PubMed:9835627). Primarily responsible for the absorption of dietary di- and tripeptides from the small intestinal lumen (By similarity). Mediates transepithelial transport of muramyl and N-formylated bacterial dipeptides contributing to recognition of pathogenic bacteria by the mucosal immune system (PubMed:15521010, PubMed:9835627)
