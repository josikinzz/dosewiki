## Subjective Experience

Adderall is a mix of dextroamphetamine and levoamphetamine, in the ratio 75% to
25%, and is prescribed to treat the symptoms of ADHD (attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder) and narcolepsy (a sleep disorder). The brand was first
introduced in 1996, with a generic version being approved in 2002.

Its recreational use is now well established and unsurprisingly, given its composition,
addiction potential and increased tolerance build quickly.

My 60mg supply came in the form of two orange pills. Identity checking their
imprints online, drugs.com states that these are: “b 974 3 0 (Amphetamine and
Dextroamphetamine 30 mg)” and that they were originally supplied by Teva
Pharmaceuticals USA.

Coincidentally, Erowid currently uses the exact same type of pill for its illustrative
photograph for amphetamine, with adderall listed as a brand name.

Adderall comes in both instant and extended release forms. Here I am covering the
IR (instant) version. Also note that some people insufflate, but I am researching this
via the oral route. A word in passing on this though: as usual, if you are insufflating,
significantly lower doses are required.

With respect to dosage, drugs-forum.com states that:

```
“Adderall is intended to be taken orally, at doses from 5-30mg (measured in
instant release). Recreational users do use more, however it is not advisable
for inexperienced users to exceed 30mg, if not tolerant to the drug”
```
As this is my first experiment with adderall, I obviously wouldn’t call myself an
experienced user of it, but might do so with respect to stimulants generally, including
street amphetamine. Combined with the TripSit and other relevant material I
therefore decide to start with 30mg. To help facilitate a faster onset I crush the pills
prior to swallowing.

In terms of expectation I am anticipating a slightly watered down version of the
effects I experienced with amphetamine (of which I took a much higher dose ).

```
T+0:00 I swallow 30mg of my supply with a glass of water [11:50am]
```
```
T+0:30 I can feel the usual stim tingles emerging, along with a light head
buzz. Already it is quite pleasant, and already I am contemplating another
half-pill (maybe 15mg) to top up.
```
```
T+1:00 I swill down another 10mg of the crushed orange debris, taking the
total to around 40mg. The buzz is currently sustained on a nice level, which I
can functionally skate above if necessary.
```

```
Unsurprisingly, the major hallmarks of amphetamine are in play now, albeit
not very strongly. These include a positive uplift, and indeed horn, if required.
```
```
T+2:00 I remain on the same plateau, which is quite nice, but the compulsion
to redose is undeniably present. Given that my overall dose is limited to the
60mg I originally acquired I am seeking to control this and spin out the
exercise as best I can, which isn’t a trivial matter. Despite this intention, I still
swallow half the remaining supply, taking the running total to around 50mg.
```
```
T+3:00 I now greedily gobble the remainder, hitting the ceiling of my 60mg.
Unfortunately this doesn’t seem to produce the mild rush of previous re-
doses, at least to the same extent, so I hypothesise that I could be hitting some
sort of barrier of diminishing returns.
```
```
T+4:00 As suspected an hour ago, I have passed the peak, and the buzz and
general elevation is slowly fading. I am still in a zone of course, but it is far less
intense than it was earlier.
```
```
I have little doubt that had I a larger stock available I would continue a little
longer, so once again a pre-planned constraint has intervened to save me from
myself.
```
```
From here I expect a gradual comedown over the next few hours, hopefully a
soft and gentle one. I remain warm with a mild head-stim, so this isn’t so bad
at the present time.
```
```
T+5:00 Stim-binge averted, I can now turn some attention to recovery. I am
targeting a decent meal in an hour or two, at which point I hope to have at
least something of an appetite.
```
```
I still feel somewhat fuzzy in a positive sense, if a little unfulfilled. I remain
physically warm and generally well.
```
```
T+7:00 The ride has basically fizzled out to a flatness. I feel slightly distant
and increasingly weary, although not particularly sleepy.
```
The night’s sheep was in fact a decent one, aided and abetted (reluctantly) by 0.5mg
of etizolam. The next morning I awoke reasonably fresh, if a little drained.

My expectation was not far off the mark. This was like a weakish re-run with
amphetamine; no doubt on account of the dose I was restricted to in comparison.
This is not to say that it wasn’t decent: it was. It is just that it peaked early, not
particularly highly, and then faded slowly over the course of the day, leaving me at a
bit of a loose end. In different circumstances I would undoubtedly have enjoyed a
better return.

Finally, and it is worth stating the obvious: the warnings I provide for amphetamine
also apply to this, so do take care, particularly with dose and frequency of use.
