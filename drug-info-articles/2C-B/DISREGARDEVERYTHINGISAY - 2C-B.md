2C-B (4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine) is a psychedelic phenethylamine of the 2C-x family. It was first synthesized by Alexander Shulgin in 1974.

This substance first saw use among the psychiatric community as an aid during therapy. It was considered one of the best drugs for this purpose because of its short duration, relative absence of side effects, and comparably mild nature.

Like many 2c-x substances, this drug is a highly dose sensitive psychedelic known for its entactogenic effects, bright visuals, and intense body load. This substance is often described by users as feeling half way between LSD and MDMA. Many reports suggest that while 2C-B’s entactogenic effects are less pronounced than MDMA, the visual effects are described as more pronounced and colourful.

The 2C-B experience contains a complex and wide array of effects which based on the predefined potential subjective effects index found [here](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effects_index), I will now begin to breakdown and describe.

**Physical Effects:**

The physical effects of 2C-B can be broken down into five components all of which progressively intensify proportional to dosage. These are described below and generally include:

- **Spontaneous tactile sensations** - The body high of 2C-B is not necessarily one of the most intense, but is instead one of the most complex compared to other psychedelics, sharing components of MDMA, 2C-E, and LSD. This is first characterized by an intense soft warm glow that grows over the body and is capable of becoming extremely physically euphoric. This is most similar to MDMA and is consistently manifested throughout the experience. This is contrasted by an intensely pleasurable yet sharp, cold electric tingling sensation which moves up and down the body. This is most similar to LSD and is also consistently manifested throughout the trip. The final physical effect noticed throughout the experience is an intense and slightly uncomfortable, energetic pins and needles sensation that manifests itself in the form of a continuously shifting and tingling sensation that travels up and down the body in spontaneous waves. This is most similar to 2C-E and is not entirely consistent throughout the trip.
- **Stimulation** - In terms of its effects on the physical energy levels of the tripper, 2C-B is usually considered to be very energetic and stimulating in a fashion that is quite comparable to that of MDMA.
- **Increased bodily control**
- **Enhancement of touch**
- **Nausea** - Mild to extreme nausea is reported when consumed in moderate to high dosages and either passes once the tripper has vomited or gradually fades by itself as the peak sets in.

**Cognitive Effects:**

The head space of 2C-B is described by many as one which is both insightful and relatively normal in its thought processes even at moderate to high dosages.

The total sum of these cognitive components regardless of the setting generally includes:

- **Introspection** - This component is consistently manifested only in the context of a non-social setting in which the user is alone.
- **Increased empathy, love and sociability** - These feelings of sociability, love and empathy are a little weaker and less sharp than those found on substances such as MDMA but still prove stronger and more consistent than other psychedelics of any class. This is capable of providing long lasting therapeutic effects.
- **Sexual arousal**
- **Acceleration of thought**
- **Time distortion**
- **Feelings of fascination, importance and awe**
- **Conceptual thinking**
- **Connectivity of thought**
- **Enhancement of current mind state**
- **Removal of cultural filter**
- **Ego suppression, loss and death**

**Visual Effects:**

*Enhancements*

2C-B presents a full and complete array of possible visual enhancements which generally include:

- **Increased visual acuity**
- **Enhancement of colours**
- **Enhanced pattern recognition**

*Distortions*

As for visual distortions and alterations, effects experienced are detailed below:

- **Visual drifting** (melting, flowing, breathing and morphing) - In comparison to other psychedelics, this effect can be described as highly detailed, slow and smooth in motion, static in appearance, and unrealistic/ cartoon like in style.
- **Tracers**
- **After images**
- **Texture repetition**
- **Colour shifting**
- **Scenery slicing**

*Geometry*

The visual geometry that is present throughout this trip can be described as more similar in appearance to that of LSD than that of 2C-E, psilocin, or ayahuasca. They can be comprehensively described as unstructured in their organization, algorithmic in geometric style, intricate in complexity, large in size, fast and smooth in motion, colourful in scheme, glossy in colour, sharp in their edges and angular in their corners. They seem high in algorithmic visuals such as fractals and at higher dosages are significantly more likely to result in states of Level 7A visual geometry over Level 7B.

*Hallucinatory States*

Like LSD, while 2C-B is capable of producing a full range of low and high level hallucinatory states, this is extremely rare and inconsistent at higher levels but common at lower and generally includes the following effects:

- **External hallucinations**
- **Internal hallucinations** - Although 2C-B is technically capable producing of hallucinatory states in a fashion that is on par with psilocin or DMT in its vividness and intensity, in comparison, these effects are extremely rare and inconsistent. Whilst traditional psychedelics such as LSA, Ayahuasca and Mescaline will induce internal hallucinations near consistently at level 5 geometry and above, 2C-B will for most go straight into Level 7A visual geometry. This lack of consistently induced hallucinatory breakthroughs means that for most, 2C-B is simply not as deep of an experience as certain other psychedelics.

**Auditory Effects:**

The auditory effects of 2C-B are more common than some psychedelics in their occurrence and are capable of producing a full range of effects which commonly include:

- **Enhancements**
- **Distortions**
- **Hallucinations**

**Physical Health Effects, Potential Addiction and Tolerance:**

There is no current data for the lethal dosage of 2C-B, but it is thought to be extremely high. Alexander Shulgin reported in his book PIHKAL that an accidental dosage of 100mg resulted in no physical or psychological damage.

Since the invention of this substance in 1974, not a single person has yet to accidentally or deliberately experience a fatal overdose with this substance. This suggests that 2C-B is very safe but please keep in mind that clinical studies assessing its safety have not been performed in any scientific context.

In terms of its tolerance, 2C-B can be redosed repeatedly with little to no loss in the strength of its subjective effects. This means that is theoretically possible to become addicted to it but thanks to its psychedelic properties users experience a powerful self-regulating quality to this substance.

**Conclusion:**

The main bulk of the 2C-B subjective effects breakdown for this particular article was not written by myself but the [PsychonautWiki](http://www.PsychonautWiki.org) admin known as [Cocoanatta](http://encyclopediapsychonautica.org/index.php?title=User:Cocoanatta). I have tried 2C-B on two separate occasions and can confirm that the descriptions are indeed accurate.

As for the substance itself, 2C-B is an incredibly fun and therapeutically beneficial substance. This makes it extremely useful for both recreational and introspective purposes. It is, in my opinion, the most suitable psychedelic for a beginner in existence due to its clear, euphoric headspace and proportionally mild visual effects in comparison to that of LSD or mushrooms.
