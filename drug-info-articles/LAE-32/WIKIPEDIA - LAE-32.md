Lysergic acid ethylamide (LAE-32 or LAE) is a psychedelic drug of the lysergamide family related to lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD). It is reported to have some LSD-like effects but is weaker and shorter lasting, with an active dose reported to be between 0.5 and 1.4 mg.
It was studied by the CIA as part of Project MKULTRA. Documents published by the CIA under the Freedom of Information Act suggest it causes "a schizophrenia-like condition" but it allows people with schizophrenia to remain indifferent to their disorder. The drug has also been studied in psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy.
LAE-32 was first described in the scientific literature by Albert Hofmann and colleagues by 1955.
