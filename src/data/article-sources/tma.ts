## Subjective Experience

This experiment was a failure, and the reason is clear: I shortcut my own safety
procedures.

I had intended to procure TMA-2, a psychedelic amphetamine first synthesised in
1933 (Viktor Bruckner) and documented by Shulgin in PiHKAL. This was being
offered as a ‘hypnotic sex drug’, with claims that it was ‘better than mescaline’.
Unfortunately, I foolishly sampled it prior to receipt of formal laboratory test results.
I recorded my experience as follows:

\`\`\`
T+0:00 Given the potential for a lengthy ride I bomb what is probably just
short of 20mg of the pink powder with my morning coffee [8:15am]
\`\`\`

\`\`\`
T+1:00 A mild headiness is starting to materialise. I am also quite cold,
especially my fingers and hands. I am rather tired, so I head to bed for a while.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+2:00 I didn’t sleep but lay daydreaming in the warmth. I emerge quite
tactile, and with a heady dreamy head space in situ. And yes, horn is of
interest, perhaps of a similar intensity level as the 2Cs.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+2:30 On this dose there aren’t any visuals of note. Certainly I am
experiencing a psychedelic aura, but can navigate and function with almost
total normality. I feel that I should have dosed higher, where a better return
would undoubtedly be found.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+4:00 I would now describe this as comfortable. The dreamy drifty but mild
psychedelia and the body warmth with gentle tactility make this more of a
gentle pleasure than a high. Whilst wishing for more action a redose is out of
the question given the long onset. However, I feel pretty decent. The potential
for sexual enhancement continues to be present.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+6:00 The ride is now fading. My underlying fatigue emerges a little from
time to time and the headspace occasionally carries the hint of a headache. I
feel a bit jaded but fairly content at the same time.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+7:00 I feel pretty close to base. The haze is still there and I am warm and
content, but the intensity is now reduced to a sort of zoned out headiness, and
lethargy. I had a short nap about an hour ago but it failed to energise me.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
The effects slowly faded over the course of the evening, although I still felt the
dying embers as I retired to bed at 10pm. Surprisingly, the night’s sleep was
reasonable, and I awoke feeling positive and healthy.
\`\`\`
Subsequently the lab confirmed that my sample was in fact TMA plus 2C-B. A few
factors here indicate that this was a deliberate scam, not least that the effective dose
of TMA is much higher than that of TMA-2 (PiHKAL cites 100mg-250mg for TMA,
with TripSit specifying a common dose of 20-40mg for TMA-2), and the addition of
2C-B would likely edge the nature of the ride towards the latter (see my earlier report
on 2C-B).

Overall this was a decent ride. Certainly, there was a psychedelic headspace, the
potential for erotica and a fairly nice body presence, albeit at a low level and without
any fireworks. However, unless and until I source some clean TMA or TMA-2 this
isn’t something I will test again, and I remain somewhat disappointed.

NOTE: Re TMA-2, the following comment from Erowid suggests that caution is
appropriate, particularly for the pre-disposed: “Although TMA-2 has some stimulant
effects, one researcher found high doses of TMA-2 caused bradycardia (slow heart)
and hypothermia (low temperature) in rats (Mallaret 2003, Ho 1970).”
