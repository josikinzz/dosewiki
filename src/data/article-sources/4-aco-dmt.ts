4-AcO-DMT (also known as Psilacetin, 4-Acetoxy-DMT, or O-Acetylpsilocin) is a synthetically produced psychoactive drug usually sold by online research chemical vendors. It is the acetylated form of the psilocybin mushroom alkaloid psilocin and is a lower homologue of 4-AcO-DET, 4-AcO-MiPT and 4-AcO-DiPT.

This substance is considered by the psychedelic community to be an extremely useful alternative to psilocybin as they are both believed to be pro-drugs of psilocin. This is because many people report that the subjective effects are indistinguishable from that of a typical psilocybin mushroom trip.

However, many people also report that 4-AcO-DMT’s effects differ greatly from that of psilocybin and psilocin. The exact differences are often difficult to define but suggest that as well as being a pro-drug to psilocin, 4-AcO-DMT is also active in itself.

The 4-AcO-DMT experience contains a complex and wide array of effects which based on the predefined potential subjective effects index found [here](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effects_index), I will now begin to breakdown and describe.

**Physical Effects:**

The physical effects of 4-AcO-DMT can be broken down into two components all of which progressively intensify proportional to dosage. These are described below and generally include:

- **Spontaneous tactile sensations** - The body high of 4-AcO-DMT can be described as a pleasurable, warm, soft and all-encompassing tingling sensation. This maintains a consistent presence that steadily rises with the onset and hits its limit once the peak has been reached.
- **Sedation** - In terms of its effects on the physical energy levels of the tripper, 4-AcO-DMT is considered by most to be relaxing, stoning and mildly sedating. This sense of sedation is often accompanied by compulsive yawning, a runny nose and watering eyes.

**Cognitive Effects:**

The head space of 4-AcO-DMT is described by many as extremely relaxing, profound and stoning in its style when compared to other commonly used psychedelics such as LSD or 2C-B which tend to be energetic and stimulating. It contains a large number of psychedelic typical and unique cognitive effects.

The most prominent of these typical effects generally include:

- **Enhancement of current mind state**
- **Connectivity of thought**
- **Feelings of fascination, importance and awe**
- **Time distortion**
- **Outrospection 
**
- **Deja-Vu**
- **Removal of cultural filter**
- **Feelings of predeterminism**
- **Conceptual thinking**
- **Direct communication with the subconsious**
- **Ego suppression, loss and death**
- **Feelings of interdependent opposites**
- **Delusions**
- **States of unity and interconnectedness**
- **Enhancement and suppression cycles - **This can be described as constant waves of extremely stimulated and profound thinking which are spontaneously surpassed in a cyclic fashion by waves of general thought suppression and mental intoxication. These two states seem to switch between each other in a consistent loop once every 20 - 60 minutes.

**Visual Effects:**

*Enhancements*

4-AcO-DMT presents a full and complete array of possible visual enhancements which generally include:

- **Increased visual acuity**
- **Enhancement of colours**
- **Enhanced pattern recognition**

*Distortions*

As for visual distortions and alterations, effects experienced are detailed below:

- **Visual drifting** (*melting, flowing, breathing and morphing*) - In comparison to other psychedelics, this effect can be described as highly detailed, slow and smooth in motion and static in its appearance.
- **Tracers**
- **After images**
- **Texture repetition**
- **Colour shifting**
- **Scenery slicing**

*Geometry*

The visual geometry that is present throughout this trip can be described as more similar in appearance to that of 4-AcO-DMT, Ayahuasca and 2C-E than LSD. It can be comprehensively described as structured in its organization, organic in geometric style, intricate in complexity, large in size, fast and smooth in motion, colourful in scheme, glossy in colour, blurred in its edges and rounded in its corners. They have a very “natural” feel to them and at higher dosages are significantly more likely to result in states of Level 7B visual geometry over Level 7A.

*Hallucinatory States*

4-AcO-DMT and its various other forms produce a full range of high level hallucinatory states in a fashion that is more consistent and reproducible than that of many other commonly used psychedelics. These effects generally include:

- **External hallucinations**
- **Internal hallucinations** - This particular effect commonly contains hallucinations with scenarios, landscapes, settings, concepts and autonomous entity contact. They are more common within dark environments and can be described as internal in their manifestation, lucid in believability, interactive in style and almost exclusively of religious, spiritual, mystical or a transcendental nature in their overall theme.

**Auditory Effects:**

The auditory effects of 4-AcO-DMT are common in their occurrence and exhibit a full range of effects which commonly include:

- **Enhancements**
- **Distortions**
- **Hallucinations**

**Physical Health Effects, Potential Addiction and Tolerance:**

The lethal dosage at which 50% of users would suffer a fatal overdose (LD50) of psilacetin has been extrapolated from animal results to be roughly 800mg for an average human being. This is 10 times the extremely high dosage of 80mg which most users would never feel the need to take.

In terms of its tolerance, 4-AcO-DMT tolerance lasts for approximately a week, meaning that it is very difficult to form an addiction to this substance. It also has a high cross-tolerance, affecting the potency of other tryptamines. Alongside of this (due to its psychedelic properties) users report a strong self-regulating quality towards the usage of this substance.

As a member of the tryptamine family, 4-AcO-DMT can be considered harmless and benign when it comes to any negative physical repercussions towards one’s health. This is supported by the total lack of any negative health reports, but of course cannot be guaranteed due to lack of formal scientific studies.

**Legal issues:**

Possession and sale of 4-AcO-DMT is unscheduled in most countries.

- **UK:** It could be considered illegal under the 1971 Misuse of Drugs Act as it metabolizes into psilocin.
- **USA:** It could be considered illegal under the Federal Analog Act as an analogue of psilocin.

**Conclusion:**

As far as I am aware, 4-AcO-DMT is by far the experientially deepest and most spiritual research chemical tryptamine that is currently available within the online market. It is in many ways considerably more practical than psilocybin mushrooms and from my personal experience indistinguishable in its effects and considerably easier to ingest with reduced nausea.

## Subjective Experience

4-ACO-DMT was first synthesised by Albert Hofmann and Franz Troxler in the early
1960's, and was patented by Sandoz Ltd in 1963. It is widely considered to produce
an almost identical experience to that of psilocybin containing mushrooms. Indeed,
Erowid states that it is "probably metabolically converted into psilocin in the body".

At time of writing this report it is increasingly popular, including with researchers
seeking to replicate the famed "McKenna experience" via doses in excess of 50mg. A
word of caution here though: there are a number of reports of ++++ experiences
occurring with doses of under 20mg. It is important, therefore, to adhere to standard
safety measures even though this chemical is generally considered to be relatively
benign.

I do have a large dose experience of 4-ACO-DMT on my future bucket list, but today I
have to remain broadly functional, as there is potential for social interaction for
which I need to be relatively unimpaired. For this reason I will start extremely low,
just to get a feel for it.

Note that I am also rather tired this morning, and slightly hung-over. This is clearly
not the perfect condition for testing, which is another factor that gravitates towards a
small dose experiment.

\`\`\`
T+0:00 I consume approximately 6mg orally: straight down the hatch with
water. [11:45am]
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+0:30 I have quickly developed a psychedelic headspace, and already it is a
fairly strong one. Colours are brighter and I notice that my focus drifts onto
different objects almost of its own accord. In my case, the commonly stated
onset period of two hours is clearly not correct.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+0:45 I feel chilly, so I add an extra layer of clothing. Regarding vision, there
is some diffraction and maybe a little morphing in play, with slight tracers and
over-currents also appearing.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+1:00 This would be very pleasant if I wasn't so tired. Checking in the
mirror, my pupils are dilated. The headspace is still very apparent.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+1:30 At this point I succumb to the need for sleep. This is a waste in some
respects, but it is needed.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+3:30 I am well awake now and find that I am close to baseline. I slept
deeply for about half an hour and dozed for the rest of the time, basking in the
headspace.
\`\`\`
There is no doubt that this was the real deal. The feel was close to my experience of
magic mushrooms, as expected, and I am surprised that it was so active at such a low
dose.

Its short duration was another surprise, even though some of the time projections
quoted online suggested that this could occur. This aspect certainly places it into a
niche that is under-populated by other psychedelics of this nature.

It was a pleasant ride, despite my poor condition.

I look forward to further experimentation during the coming months, and perhaps a
deeper and more spiritually meaningful trip.

4-Acetoxy-DMT
 
Basics
 
by Erowid
 
DESCRIPTION #
 
4-Acetoxy-DMT is a synthetic psychedelic drug with a limited history of use. It is likely that, similar to psilocybin, it is rapidly converted by first-pass metabolism into psilocin. It is reportedly very similar to psilocybin/psilocin in effects, although it is sometimes described as "warmer" or "more euphoric" than psilocybin-containing mushrooms. Data regarding its use and effects is limited. 
 
[ [Main 4-Acetoxy-DMT Vault](https://erowid.org/4_acetoxy_dmt.shtml) ]
 
[Dose](https://erowid.org/4_acetoxy_dmt_dose.shtml) #
 
A common oral dose of 4-Acetoxy-DMT is between 10 and 25 mg. Several reports describe doses of 25-30 mg as very strong. Insufflation appears to produce more potent effects with a more rapid onset. A smoked dose of 40 mg of fumurate was described as extremely weak, comparable to the effects of 5 mg oral.
 
Price #
 
Not commonly available. In September 2010, Internet vendors listed 4-Acetoxy-DMT at \$200 to \$350 per gram, significantly higher than a few years earlier.
 
Law #
 
4-Acetoxy-DMT is unscheduled and uncontrolled in the United States, making it technically legal to possess. Sales or possession could be prosecuted under the Analog Act, although we are not aware of this having occurred. We are not aware of any other country where it is specifically listed as illegal.
 
Chemistry #
 
4-Acetoxy- *N* , *N* -Dimethyltryptamine (4-AcO-DMT) is a synthetic chemical in the tryptamine class. It is related structurally to DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, bufotenine, psilocybin, psilocin, and the neurotransmitter serotonin (5-HT).
 
Pharmacology #

History #
 
4-Acetoxy-DMT is a novel compound with relatively little availability on the research chemicals market. Since 2007, its use appears to primarily be confined to psychedelic connoisseurs.
 
Terminology / Slang #
 
The Substance:
 
4-Acetoxy-DMT; Psilacetin.
 
The Experience:
 
No common terms known.
 
[EFFECTS](https://erowid.org/4_acetoxy_dmt_effects.shtml) #
 
Psilocybin, present in magic mushrooms, is metabolized into psilocin; a similar situation likely occurs with 4-Acetoxy-DMT being metabolized into psilocin. The effects of 4-Acetoxy-DMT are said to be very similar to the effects of psilocybin/psilocin, although enough users have reported some differences that it is speculated that 4-Acetoxy-DMT may be uniquely active on its own, and not simply active due to (probably) being metabolized into psilocin. Users report dose-dependent colorful visual effects and a sense of physical energy or euphoria, sometimes accompanied by abstract, associative, "trippy" thought patterns, or derealization. 
 
 Several available reports of 4-Acetoxy-DMT compare it favorably to psilocybin, describing it as more euphoric, gentle, warm, and colorful. It has also been described as less jarring, and less likely to produce nausea. However, most of these comparisons are made with mushrooms, not pure psilocybin. In addition, it is unknown to what degree expectancy plays a role in shaping such experiences.
 
Onset #
 
Effects take about 30-40 minutes to begin, with peak effects at around 2 hours. The onset has been characterized as smoother, gentler, and more pleasant than the onset of mushrooms.
 
Duration #
 
The primary effects of 4-Acetoxy-DMT typically last for about 4-6 hours. They have been described as lasting from 3-4 hours (low oral doses) to 8-10 hours (moderate to strong oral doses).
 
Visual Effects #
 
Visuals have been described as being similar to those produced by psilocybin/psilocin, 2C-B, and DMT.
 
PROBLEMS #
 
As with all psychedelics, some people may experience the effects of 4-Acetoxy-DMT as confusing, frightening, or unpleasant. While 4-Acetoxy-DMT is pharmacologically similar to psilocybin and may well be similar in terms of its relative safety, it has not undergone toxicological studies and its possible harms are unknown. Some users may have idiosyncratic responses to dosage and effects. 
 
 A review of available reports suggests that many people have begun with doses that generated stronger effects than expeceted or desired, in the 25-30 mg range. One report describes a person who took "25 mg oral and had a 2 hr blackout, in which he curled up in a bed and mumbled nonsense to himself. He had absolutely no recollection of the 2 hours."
 
Contraindications #
 
- Do not operate heavy machinery. Do not drive. The effects of 4-Acetoxy-DMT may be dramatically increased if used by individuals currently taking MAOIs. MAOI drugs include the prescription antidepressants Nardil (phenelzine), Parnate (tranylcypromine), Marplan (isocarboxazid), Eldepryl (l-deprenyl), and Aurorex or Manerix (moclobemide), as well as the harmala alkaloids present in *Banisteriopsis caapi* (ayahuasca) and *Peganum harmala* (Syrian rue). Check with your doctor if you are not sure whether your medication is an MAOI. Individuals currently in the midst of emotional or psychological upheaval in their everyday lives should be careful about choosing to use psychedelics as they can trigger even more difficulty. Individuals with a family history of schizophrenia or early onset mental illness should be extremely careful because psychedelics have been known to trigger latent psychological and mental problems.
 
Addiction Potential #
 
Owing to its pharmacological similarity to psilocybin, it is very unlikely that 4-Acetoxy-DMT is addictive. Howver, it has not been studied for addiction liability.

DESCRIPTION #
 
General Effects Notes
 The effects of 4-Acetoxy-DMT are usually compared to those of psilocybin/psilocin, although it is sometimes described as "warmer" or "more euphoric" than psilocybin-containing mushrooms. 
 
 
Routes of Administration
 4-Acetoxy-DMT is most often taken orally, though there are reports of it being insufflated. 
 
 
Addiction and Compulsive Use
 4-Acetoxy-DMT is not known to be associated with compulsive use and physical dependence is extremely unlikely. Because its pharmacology and effects are similar to psilocybin, it is not considered to have a high risk of leading to addictive use.
 
EXPERIENCE EXCERPTS #
 
[16 mg] "Wowww! The colors! I never had visual changes of that kind with my eyes open. The room tends to transform itself. CEVs comparable to DMT, my thinking is out of order, -nothing! The muscles of my face, esp. that of my cheeks contract that way that my face transforms into a smile. Moving my hand in front of my eyes leaves long traces. [...] This stuff makes me active like nothing ever tried before. There are so many crazy things that spring into my mind, which I could do now: Walking out jumping around... I must take me completely together not to do any really stupid thing. I'm tripping too hard for that all." -- [Exp 57030](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=57030)
 
[20 mg] "I began to feel mildly high and clear-headed, my thoughts flowed faster and changed rapidly, and it became a little bit difficult to construct sentences from my thoughts, so I stayed fairly quiet. [...] When I focused on the sky, I saw pleasant visuals forming, but I had to focus for them to appear, and if I looked back at my surroundings they disappeared. T." -- [Exp 65909](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=65909)
 
[32 mg, cumulative] "By T+5 hours, the overwhelming emotions had ceased and I was back in control. I found myself in a stable, pleasurable, somewhat sedated state. The selective visual effect continued. I was a bit sweaty and exhausted, but I felt complete. This comfortable, middle-ground state was mine to enjoy for two to three hours. The hallucinogenic effects were gone by T+8h, and my pupils remained dilated for a couple of hours afterwards." -- [Exp 66763](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=66763)
 
[45 mg] "By this time, I saw no surface that did not bear a host of multi-layered evil faces staring me down in all my littleness, in all my squalor, in all my waste of a life. Eyes, eyes, eyes - all dissolving my very person before their slicing scrutiny. [...] I felt there was an out-of-control engine inside my head, redlining and about to explode. I had no recourse, no sanctuary. Everywhere I went, the eyes followed and the realities dissolved." -- [Exp 84044](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=84044)
 
[125 mg] "...as I reached for a towel the nausea came back in a hefty wave. So did the visuals. I ended up back on my shower floor with a towel wrapped around me, getting soaked by the warm water again. I breathed at a steady pace whilst watching the bathroom walls turn purple and green." -- [Exp 86651](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=86651)
 
[150 mg] "I literally think I almost died. Took it at 5:30pm. Half an hour or more in I was getting some visuals, though really not that intense or even very good. I started to get anxiety and feel nauseous/sick. I was outside walking around. I managed to make it home luckily. [...] Generally weak visuals, really messed with my blood pressure and heart." -- [Exp 86617](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=86617)

**4-Acetoxy- *N* , *N* -dimethyltryptamine** (also known as **4-AcO-DMT** , **4-acetoxy-DMT** , ***O* -acetylpsilocin** , **psilacetin** , and " **synthetic mushrooms** ") is a novel lesser-known [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) substance of the [tryptamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tryptamine) class. It is structurally related to [psilocybin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocybin) and [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) , the active ingredient in [psilocybin mushrooms](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocybin_mushrooms) ("magic mushrooms"). 4-AcO-DMT is thought to produce its effects by binding to [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) [receptors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Receptors) in the brain; however, the precise mechanism is not known.

4-AcO-DMT was first synthesized in 1963 by [Albert Hofmann](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Hofmann) and Franz Troxler as part of a chemical investigation into psilocin analogs. However, it was not tested for psychoactivity during this time. It is unknown when it was first explored in humans. A paper authored by [David E. Nichols](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/David_E._Nichols) in 1999 proposed its potential use as an alternative to psilocybin for pharmacological research due to the lower cost of synthesis. Reports of recreational use began to surface shortly after its appearance on the online [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) market in the 2010s. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

[Subjective effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effects) include [geometric visual effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Geometry) , [time distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Time_distortion) , [enhanced introspection](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Introspection) , [euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Euphoria) , and [ego loss](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ego_loss) . 4-AcO-DMT's effects are considered to be nearly identical to psilocybin, with some subtle differences. It has been theorized to act as a [prodrug](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Prodrug) to [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) in a manner similar to [psilocybin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocybin) , which may account for this similarity. 4-AcO-DMT's classical psychedelic effects and favorable tolerability profile has led it to become popular among novel psychoactive substance users who seek mystical or [entheogenic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entheogenic) experiences. It is occasionally sold in capsules or pressed pills and marketed as "synthetic shrooms".

Very little data exists on the pharmacology, metabolism, and toxicity of 4-AcO-DMT. Although its toxicity profile is believed to be near-identical with psilocybin mushrooms (see [this section](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocybin_mushrooms#Toxicity_and_harm_potential) ), which are known to be physiologically non-toxic, there is no hard data to support this claim. It is highly advised to use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Harm_reduction_practices) if using this substance.

## History and culture

4-AcO-DMT and several other esters of psilocin were patented on January 16, 1963 by Sandoz Ltd. via Albert Hofmann & Franz Troxler. However, its pharmacology and subjective effects were not investigated. It is unknown when 4-AcO-DMT's effects in humans were first explored.

## Chemistry

4-AcO-DMT is a synthetic member of organic compounds known as [tryptamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tryptamines) . Tryptamines share a core structure that consists of a bicylic indole heterocycle attached at R 3 to a terminal amino group via an ethyl side chain. 4-AcO-DMT is substituted at R 4 of its indole heterocycle with an acetoxy (-AcO) functional group CH 3 COO−. It also contains two methyl groups CH 3 - bound to the terminal amine R N of the ethyl side chain.

4-AcO-DMT is the acetate ester analog of [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) ( **4-HO-DMT** ) and the N-substituted methyl homolog of [4-AcO-MET](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-AcO-MET) . It is the O-acetylated form of [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) , whereas psilocybin is the O-phosphorylated form.

## Pharmacology

Upon entering the body, *O* -acetylpsilocin, or 4-AcO-DMT, is deacetylated to psilocin by deacetylases/acetyltransferases during first-pass metabolism and during subsequent passes through the liver (evident as psilacetin is also active via parenteral routes of ingestion).

The [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) effects of 4-AcO-DMT are believed to come from its activity as a [partial agonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist#Agonists) for the [5-HT2A receptor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin#The_5-HT_system) . However, the role of these interactions and how they result in the [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) experience is the subject of ongoing scientific investigation.

Claims of subjective differences in effects between the acetylated and non-acetylated forms of psilocin vary: some users report that *O* -acetylpsilocin lasts slightly longer, whilst others report that it lasts for a considerably shorter time. Many users report less body load and nausea compared with psilocin. Some users find that the visual effects produced by *O* -acetylpsilocin more closely resemble those produced by DMT than those produced by psilocin or psilocybin. These differences could be possible if psilacetin is psychoactive in itself and not merely as a prodrug. Despite this, there have been no controlled clinical studies to distinguish among the phenomenological effects of psilacetin, psilocin, and psilocybin.

## Subjective effects

Users frequently describe 4-AcO-DMT as being extremely similar to psilocybin mushrooms. It is generally described as euphoric, gentle, warm, and colorful. Visuals are reported by some users to be brighter and more neon in a manner reminiscent of DMT. It is also reported to be less nauseating than psilocybin mushrooms, which may be due to the fact that it does not require digesting mushroom matter.

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation)** - 4-AcO-DMT is typically reported to be relaxing, stoning, and mildly sedating. This sense of sedation is often accompanied by [excessive yawning](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Excessive_yawning) and watery eyes.
- **[Perception of bodily heaviness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perception_of_bodily_heaviness)**
- **[Spontaneous bodily sensations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_bodily_sensations)** - The general "body high" of 4-AcO-DMT can be described as pleasurable, warm, soft, and all-encompassing tingling sensation. This maintains a consistent presence that steadily rises with the onset and hits its limit once the peak has been reached. Once the peak of the experience or sensation is reached it can produce feelings of pronounced [physical and cognitive euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Euphoria) along with tranquility, a sense of lethargy or sedation, or total immobilization depending on the dose.
- **[Tactile enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_enhancement)** - This effect is less prominent than with that of [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) or [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) but is still present and unique in its character. It is repeatedly described as feeling very primitive in its nature oftentimes with the small hairs on the user's arms or legs feeling slightly [itchy](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Itchiness) or even ticklish against the skin.
- **[Changes in felt bodily form](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Changes_in_felt_bodily_form)** - This effect is often accompanied by a sense of warmth and usually occurs around or directly after the peak of the experience. Users can feel as if they are physically part of or conjoined with other objects in a seamless continuity. This is usually reported as feeling comfortable, tranquil, and mindful, though it can also manifest in the form of bodily tension.
- **[Changes in felt gravity](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Changes_in_felt_gravity)**
- **[Nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea)** - This effect can be greatly lessened or even completely avoided if the individual has an empty stomach prior to ingestion. It is sometimes recommended that one either refrain from eating for approximately 6 to 8 hours beforehand or to eat a light meal 3 to 4 hours before if the user is feeling physically fatigued and undernourished. The nausea produced by 4-AcO-DMT is generally considered to be much less prominent than it is with [psilocybin mushrooms](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocybin#Psilocybin-containing_mushrooms) , perhaps owing to the fact that there is no fungal-matter the body has to digest when the isolated synthetic form is consumed.
- **[Temperature regulation suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Temperature_regulation_suppression)** - 4-AcO-DMT can cause fluctuations in the user's internal sense of temperature, which can manifest as sudden bouts of uncomfortable coldness or warmth, which is why a climate-controllable environment is strongly recommended.
- **[Muscle contractions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_contractions)** - The muscle contractions that can occur on 4-AcO-DMT tend to be transient and benign feeling in nature, compared to many other [tryptamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tryptamines) , [phenethylamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamines) and [lysergamides](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Lysergamides) .
- **[Muscle relaxation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_relaxation)**
- **[Excessive yawning](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Excessive_yawning)** - This effect seems to be uniquely pronounced among psilocin and related tryptamines. It can occur to a lesser degree on [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) and very rarely on psychedelic [phenethylamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamines) like [mescaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mescaline) . It typically occurs in conjunction with [watery eyes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Watery_eyes) .

- **[Increased salivation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_salivation)**
- **[Teeth grinding](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Teeth_grinding)** - This effect is considerably less intense when compared with substances like [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) when it occurs.
- **[Brain zaps](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Brain_zaps)** - This effect is uncommon and thought to only occur in those who are predisposed to them. It is much less prevalent and intense than those that occur with serotonin releasing agents such as [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) .
- **[Seizure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizure)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] - This is a rarely observed effect and is thought to primarily be a risk factor in those already predisposed to them, particularly while in physically taxing conditions such as being overheated, dehydrated, undernourished or fatigued. ### Visual effects

- **[Environmental patterning](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Environmental_patterning)**
 
#### Geometry
 
The visual geometry of 4-AcO-DMT can be described as more similar in appearance to that of [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) , low-medium dose [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT) , and [ayahuasca](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ayahuasca) as opposed to [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) or [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) . It can be comprehensively described through its [variations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Geometry#Variations) as intricate in complexity, abstract in form, organic in style, structured in organization, brightly lit and multicolored in scheme, glossy in shading, soft in edges, large in size, slow in speed, smooth in motion, rounded in corners, non-immersive in-depth and consistent in intensity. They can be described as having a "natural" feel and, at higher doses, are significantly more likely to result in states of [Level 8B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Level_8B) visual geometry over [Level 8A](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Level_8A) .
 
#### Hallucinatory states
 
4-AcO-DMT produces a full range of high-level hallucinatory states in a fashion that is more consistent and reproducible than that of many other commonly used [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) . These effects generally include:
 
- **[Transformations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Transformations)**
- **[Machinescapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Machinescapes)** - This effect is a rare effect that typically only occurs at very strong to heavy doses, and not as consistently as with notably visual psychedelics like [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT) , [ETH-LAD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/ETH-LAD) , and [2C-P](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-P) , and atypical psychedelics like [salvia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Salvia) .
- **[Internal hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucination)** ( *[autonomous entities](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Autonomous_entities)* ; *[settings, sceneries, and landscapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Settings,_sceneries,_and_landscapes)* ; *[perspective hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perspective_hallucinations)* and *[scenarios and plots](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenarios_and_plots)* ) - This effect is very consistent in dark environments at appropriately high doses. They can be comprehensively described through their [variations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Internal_hallucinations#Variations) as lucid in believability, interactive in style, new experiences in content, autonomous in controllability, [geometry](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Geometry) -based in style and almost exclusively of a personal, religious, spiritual, science-fiction, fantasy, surreal, nonsensical or transcendental nature in their overall theme.
- **[External hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/External_hallucination)** ( *[autonomous entities](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Autonomous_entities)* ; *[settings, sceneries, and landscapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Settings,_sceneries,_and_landscapes)* ; *[perspective hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perspective_hallucinations)* and *[scenarios and plots](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenarios_and_plots)* ) - These are more common within dark environments and can be comprehensively described through their [variations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/External_hallucinations#Variations) as lucid in believability, interactive in style, new experiences in content, autonomous in controllability, geometry-based in style and almost exclusively of a personal, religious, spiritual, science-fiction, fantasy, surreal, nonsensical or transcendental nature in their overall theme. ### Cognitive effects
 
- The cognitive effects and general head space of 4-AcO-DMT are commonly described as extremely relaxing, profound and slow-paced in style when compared to other commonly used [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) , such as [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) or [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) , which have a distinct energetic and stimulating push. It is also generally regarded as being notably more lucid than [psilocybin mushrooms](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocybin#Psilocybin-containing_mushrooms) . 
- **[Analysis enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Analysis_enhancement)** - This effect is consistent in its manifestation with a tendency to be [outrospective](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Outrospection) in nature, but may also manifest as [introspection](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Introspection) depending on one's set and setting.
- **[Novelty enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Novelty_enhancement)**
- **[Immersion enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Immersion_enhancement)**
- **[Creativity enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Creativity_enhancement)**
- **[Conceptual thinking](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Conceptual_thinking)**
- **[Personal bias suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Personal_bias_suppression)**
- **[Multiple thought streams](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Multiple_thought_streams)**
- **[Emotion enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Emotion_enhancement)** - This effect can be described as being more prominent, consistent and profound when compared to other traditional psychedelics such as [mescaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mescaline) or [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) . This can lead to strong feelings of compassion, urgency and even completely sporadic moments of intense emotional significance that can also be periodically affected by [enhancement and suppression cycles](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Enhancement_and_suppression_cycles) .
- **[Simultaneous emotions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Simultaneous_emotions)**
- **[Empathy, affection, and sociability enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Empathy,_affection,_and_sociability_enhancement)** - This effect differs from [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) and other [entactogens](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entactogens) in that it isn't as central to the experience, feels less forced and more natural and is experienced at a less consistent rate. While the substance consistently produces heightened empathy and affection, sociability enhancement in particular only occurs rarely if at all due to the language and memory suppressing cognitive effects that accompany the experience.
- **[Language suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Language_suppression)** - This effect can be described as a perceived inability or general unwillingness to talk aloud despite feeling perfectly capable of formulating coherent thoughts within one's internal narrative. It is much more common among inexperienced users.
- **[Enhancement and suppression cycles](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Enhancement_and_suppression_cycles)** - This can be described as constant waves of extremely stimulated and profound thinking which are spontaneously surpassed in a cyclic fashion by waves of general thought suppression and mental intoxication. These two states seem to switch between each other in a consistent loop once every 20 to 60 minutes when present.
- **[Increased sense of humor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_sense_of_humor)** 
- **[Laughter fits](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Laughter_fits)**
- **[Increased music appreciation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_music_appreciation)**
- **[Cognitive euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_euphoria)**
- **[Memory suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Memory_suppression)** 
- **[Ego death](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ego_death)**
- **[Feelings of impending doom](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Feelings_of_impending_doom)** - This effect is usually only experienced during the [come up](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Duration#Come_up) phase but typically completely passes or subsides once the primary effects begin. It should be noted that this effect is relatively consistent and normal for psilocin and related [tryptamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tryptamines) which is why a [positive and well-informed mindset](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Set_and_setting) is key. Less regularly this aspect can also occur during the peak but will most often be met after with sensations of [euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_euphoria) and [rejuvenation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Rejuvenation) .
- **[Catharsis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Catharsis)**
- **[Rejuvenation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Rejuvenation)** - While this effect can occur spontaneously at any point, it typically follows a difficult phase of the experience, if not the entire experience itself.
- **[Thought connectivity](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_connectivity)**
- **[Thought deceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_deceleration)**
- **[Thought organization](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_organization)**
- **[Thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops)**
- **[Time distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Time_distortion)**
- **[Confusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Confusion)**
- **[Delusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusion)**
- **[Déjà vu](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/D%C3%A9j%C3%A0_vu)**
- **[Mindfulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mindfulness)**
- **[Ego replacement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ego_replacement)** - Although this effect is rare and more likely to occur with certain psychedelics like [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT) or [ayahuasca](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ayahuasca) , it can still occur spontaneously, typically with higher doses.
- **[Personality regression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Personality_regression)** - While this effect is not typically observed, it can still spontaneously manifest and is thought to depend primarily on the user's [set and setting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Set_and_setting) . ### Auditory effects
 
- - **[Auditory enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_enhancement)**
- **[Auditory distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_distortion)**
- **[Auditory hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_hallucination)** ### Multi-sensory effects
 
- - **[Synaesthesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Synaesthesia)** - In its fullest manifestation, this is a very rare and non-reproducible effect. Increasing the dose can increase the likelihood of this occurring, but seems to only be a prominent part of the experience among those who are already predisposed to synaesthetic states.
- **[Dosage independent intensity](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dosage_independent_intensity)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] ### Transpersonal effects
 
- - **[Existential self-realization](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Existential_self-realization)**
- **[Identity alteration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Identity_alteration)**
- **[Spirituality enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spirituality_enhancement)**
- **[Unity and interconnectedness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Unity_and_interconnectedness)**
### Combination effects

- **[Cannabis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cannabis)** - Cannabis is reported to strongly intensify the visual, sensory, and cognitive effects of 4-AcO-DMT. This combination should be used with extreme caution, as anecdotal reports suggest it increases the risk of experiencing a [bad trip](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bad_trip) , characterized by [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [confusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Confusion) , and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) .
- **[Dissociatives](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociatives)** - 4-AcO-DMT enhances the geometry, euphoria, dissociation and hallucinatory effects of all dissociatives, especially dissociative-induced [holes, spaces, and voids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_disconnection#Holes.2C_spaces_and_voids) . It may also significantly increase [internal hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucinations) , [confusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Confusion) , [nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea) , [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) and the chance of a [psychotic reaction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) .
- **[MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA)** - 4-AcO-DMT strongly amplifies the visual, physical and cognitive effects of [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) . The synergy between these substances is unpredictable, and it is best to start with lower doses than one would take for both substances individually. The toxicity risk of this combination is unknown, although there is some evidence that suggests this may increase the the neurotoxic effects of MDMA.
- **[Alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol)** - This combination is not typically advised due to alcohol’s potential to produce [dehydration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dehydration) , [nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea) , and [physical fatigue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_fatigue) , which can negatively affect the experience (for moderate to high doses). This combination is, however, considered to be reasonably safe in low doses and, when used responsibly, can often "take the edge off" the experience by dulling 4-AcO-DMT's psychedelic effects in a manner somewhat similar to benzodiazepines.
- **[Benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines)** - Depending on the dose, benzodiazepines can moderately to completely decrease the intensity of the cognitive, physical, and visual effects of a 4-AcO-DMT experience. They can be effective at mitigating [bad trips](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bad_trips) by reducing excessive anxiety and hallucinations. Caution is advised when obtaining them for this purpose due to their high abuse potential.

## Toxicity and harm potential

The toxicity and long-term health effects of 4-AcO-DMT have not been studied and the exact toxic dose is unknown. This is because 4-AcO-DMT is a [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) with a very short history of human usage. 4-AcO-DMT is assumed to have a similar safety profile as [psilocybin mushrooms](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocybin_mushrooms) due to their similar chemical structures, although there is currently no data to support this.

Anecdotal evidence suggests that there are no negative health effects attributed to simply trying 4-AcO-DMT by itself at low to moderate doses and using it very sparingly (but nothing can be completely guaranteed). [Independent research](https://www.google.com/) should always be done to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe before consumption.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this substance.

### Dependence and abuse potential

Like other psychedelics, 4-AcO-DMT is considered to be non-addictive with low potential for abuse.

Tolerance to the effects of 4-AcO-DMT is built almost immediately after ingestion. After that, it takes about 7 days for tolerance to return to baseline (in the absence of further consumption). 4-AcO-DMT produces cross-tolerance with all [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) , meaning that after the consumption of 4-AcO-DMT all psychedelics will have a reduced effect.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **[Lithium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_(medication))** - Lithium is commonly prescribed for the treatment of [bipolar disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder) . There is a large body of anecdotal evidence that suggests taking it with [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) significantly increases the risk of [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) and [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) . As a result, this combination is strictly discouraged.
- **[Cannabis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cannabis)** - Cannabis may have an unexpectedly strong and unpredictable synergy with the effects of 4-AcO-DMT. Caution is advised with this combination as it can significantly increase the risk of adverse psychological reactions like [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) , and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) .

## Legal status

4-AcO-DMT is not listed under any international drug schedules such as the UN Convention on Psychotropic Substances. As a result, it exists in a legal grey area in many countries, meaning that while it is not specifically illegal, individuals may still be charged for its possession under certain circumstances such as under analogue laws and with the intent to sell or consume.

- **Australia** : 4-AcO-DMT can be considered an analog of psilocin, making it a Schedule 9 controlled substance in Australia under the Poisons Standard. A Schedule 9 substance is a substance which may be abused or misused, the manufacture, possession, sale or use of which should be prohibited by law except when required for medical or scientific research, or for analytical, teaching or training purposes with approval of Commonwealth and/or State or Territory Health Authorities.
- **Belgium** : 4-AcO-DMT is illegal to import in Belgium. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **Brazil** : 4-AcO-DMT is illegal to possess, produce, and sell as it is listed on Portaria SVS/MS nº 344.
- **Germany** : Because it is an ester of DMT, 4-AcO-DMT is controlled under Anlage I BtMG (Narcotics Act, Schedule I) as of January 24, 1974. It is illegal to manufacture, possess, import, export, buy, sell, procure or dispense it without a license.
- **Italy** : 4-AcO-DMT is illegal in Italy as it is an ester of an illegal substance. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **Japan** : 4-AcO-DMT is a controlled substance in Japan effective July 29th, 2015.
- **Sweden** : 4-AcO-DMT is a Schedule I controlled substance as of January 25, 2017
- **Switzerland** : 4-AcO-DMT could be considered an ester analog of Psilocin, which would make it illegal according to Buchstabe B.
- **Turkey:** 4-AcO-DMT is a classed as drug and is illegal to possess, produce, supply, or import.
- **United Kingdom** : 4-AcO-DMT is a Class A drug in the UK as it is an ester of the Class A drug psilocin.
- **United States** : 4-AcO-DMT is not scheduled in the United States. It may be considered an analogue of psilocin, a Schedule I drug under the Controlled Substances Act, which means the sale for human consumption or the use for non-medical or research purposes could be prosecuted as crimes under the Federal Analogue Act.

**O-Acetylpsilocin** (also known as **Psilacetin**, **4-Acetoxy-DMT**, or **4-AcO-DMT**) is a synthetically produced psychoactive drug with a limited history of use. Its effects and duration are similar to those of Psilocybin/Psilocin although it is sometimes described as "warmer" or "more euphoric" than psilocybin-containing mushrooms. It is probably metabolically converted into Psilocin in the body, but there are also reasons to believe that 4-acetoxy-DMT might itself be active in the brain, producing effects that are distinct from Psilocin.

## Differences between O-Acetylpsilocin and Psilocybin Mushrooms

Although very similar chemically and in effect, there are some slight differences between O-Acetylpsilocin (4-AcO-DMT) and common strains of Psilocybin mushrooms. Firstly, the powdered nature of 4-aco-dmt means that it can be processed faster in the body, leading to a faster onset and shorter duration. This can also make the effects of 4-aco-dmt seem more intense when first coming up.

Ingesting mushrooms often creates feelings of nausea for the user due to the flesh of the fungi containing chitin, and for this reason it seems that 4-AcO-DMT has far fewer reports of feelings of nausea or vomiting. Insufflation is an option with 4-AcO-DMT, leading to stronger effects for the provided dosage and an even faster onset and shorter duration. It is not possible or advisable to attempt to insufflate magic mushrooms.

Most psilocybin containing mushrooms will often contain other active ingredients, meaning that depending on the strain the effects of mushrooms could feel different to those of 4-AcO-DMT. The most common active ingredients in magic mushrooms are Psilocybin, Psilocin, Baeocystin and Norbeaocystin, whereas 4-AcO-DMT metabolizes into pure psilocin.

## Dosage

Ideal dosage varies widely between individuals. Some people get very heavy mental effects and others find the mental effects light. It's best to start low and see how you are impacted. While extremely strong doses of 4-AcO-DMT seem to be well tolerated physically, it is ill-advised to jump into extremely large doses.

| Light | 5-10mg |
| --- | --- |
| Common | 10-25mg |
| Strong | 25-40mg |
| Heavy | 40mg+ |

## Duration

| Onset | 20-45 minutes (depending on stomach contents) |
| --- | --- |
| Peak | 3-4 hours |
| After-effects | 2-4 hours |

## Effects

### Postive

- Mood lift, euphoria
- Increased giggling and laughing
- Creative, philosophical or deep thinking : ideas flow more easily
- Boring tasks or entertainment can become more interesting or funny
- Sensation of insight
- Life-changing spiritual experience
- Intense feelings of wonder

### Neutral

- Feeling more emotionally sensitive
- General change in consciousness (as with many psychoactives)
- Time perception alteration
- Sensitivity to light; lights seem brighter
- Starring and rainbow patterns around pinpoint lights
- Increased detection of motion in peripheral vision
- Open and closed-eye visuals (common at medium or stronger dose)
- Pupil dilation
- Sensation of energy or buzzing in the nervous system/peripheral limbs
- Softening or loss of ego in higher dosages

### Negative

- Intense feelings of fear
- Mild to severe anxiety
- Dizziness, confusion
- Confusion

## Harm Reduction

### Interactions

  "wikipedia": `# 4-AcO-DMT
*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4-AcO-DMT*

4-Acetoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (4-AcO-DMT or 4-acetoxy-DMT), also known as O-acetylpsilocin or psilacetin, is a psychedelic drug of the tryptamine family related to psilocybin and psilocin. It is a synthetic derivative of psilocin (4-HO-DMT) in which the hydroxyl group has been acetylated, and is the analogue of psilocybin (4-PO-DMT) in which the phosphate ester has been replaced with an acetate ester. The drug is a prodrug of psilocin and is orally active similarly to psilocybin.
As a prodrug of psilocin, 4-AcO-DMT acts as a non-selective serotonin receptor agonist, including of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor. The hallucinogenic effects of psilocin are thought to be mediated by activation of this receptor, although other receptors also contribute to its effects. 4-AcO-DMT's effects are reported to be similar to those of psilocybin and psilocybin mushrooms. However, it has been said to have reduced side effects such as nausea and body load that can be caused by ingestion of whole psilocybin mushrooms. It is also said to have a faster onset and shorter duration than psilocybin. The drug is not expected to differ from psilocybin or psilocin in terms of safety. 4-AcO-DMT is modestly less potent by weight than psilocybin in animals when they are given at equimolar doses.
4-AcO-DMT was first described in a patent by Albert Hofmann in 1963 and its chemical synthesis was improved by David E. Nichols and colleagues in 1999. It was suggested by Nichols as a more economical and accessible alternative to psilocybin for use in scientific research, as the synthesis of psilocybin is more challenging and as psilocybin is a controlled substance. 4-AcO-DMT was first detected as a designer drug in Europe in 2009. It became increasingly prevalent as a recreational drug in the 2010s and has been the most commonly used novel tryptamine. In the 2020s, 4-AcO-DMT became widely encountered in the form of mushroom edibles in the United States as an alternative to psilocybin. Relatedly, it has sometimes been referred to as "synthetic shrooms". Mushrooms edibles may contain 4-AcO-DMT, Amanita muscaria mushroom constituents, or non-mushroom drugs such as bath salts, and have been linked to poisonings and deaths.
4-AcO-DMT is not scheduled under United States law or any international drug schedules, including the United Nations 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances, making it a potentially more accessible alternative to psilocybin for research. It can be imported and possessed for research in the United States if labeled “not for human consumption,” but using it in vivo is illegal and violates the Federal Analogue Act.

## Use and effects

Claims of subjective differences in effects between the acetylated and non-acetylated forms of psilocin vary: some users report that 4-AcO-DMT lasts slightly longer, whilst others report that it lasts for a considerably shorter time. Many users report less body load and nausea compared with psilocin. Some users find that the visual effects produced by 4-AcO-DMT more closely resemble those produced by DMT than those produced by psilocin or psilocybin. Despite the preceding reports however, there have been no controlled clinical studies to distinguish the subjective effects of psilacetin, psilocin, and psilocybin.

## Interactions

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

4-AcO-DMT is a prodrug of psilocin (4-HO-DMT). As a prodrug of psilocin, 4-AcO-DMT acts as a non-selective agonist of serotonin receptors, including of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor. The psychedelic effects of 4-AcO-DMT are mediated specifically by activation of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor.
Similarly to psilocybin, psilocin, and other serotonergic psychedelics, 4-AcO-DMT produces the head-twitch response, a behavioral proxy of psychedelic effects, in rodents. In addition, like psilocybin and other psychedelics, 4-AcO-DMT fully substitutes for the psychedelic DOM in rodent drug discrimination tests. 4-AcO-DMT produces effects such as hypolocomotion and hypothermia in rodents as with psilocin as well.

### Pharmacokinetics

There are no clinical studies of the pharmacokinetics of 4-AcO-DMT as of 2024. However, the pharmacokinetics of 4-AcO-DMT have been studied in rodents. The drug was confirmed to act as a prodrug of psilocin similarly to psilocybin (4-PO-DMT). However, given by intraperitoneal injection at equimolar doses, 4-AcO-DMT showed only 70% of the relative bioavailability or total exposure of psilocybin. Hence, 4-AcO-DMT results in modestly lower psilocin levels than psilocybin even when the drugs are given at equivalent doses with adjustment for differences in molecular weight. Along similar lines, the psilocin concentrations with 4-AcO-DMT 15 minutes after administration were 75 to 90% of those of an equimolar dose of psilocybin. The elimination half-life of psilocin was approximately 30 minutes and did not differ between 4-AcO-DMT and psilocybin. Psilocin ester prodrugs like 4-AcO-DMT are cleaved into psilocin by esterase enzymes.
A 2025 in-vitro study examined the stability and metabolism of several psilocin ester prodrugs, including 4-AcO-DMT. The results showed that 4-AcO-DMT was rapidly broken down into psilocin by esterase enzymes, with over 99.9% of the prodrug converted within 5 minutes under conditions mimicking the human body (i.e., in human plasma). These findings support the idea that 4-AcO-DMT is quickly and efficiently converted into psilocin before it enters the bloodstream, and that the prodrug itself likely contributes little to the overall pharmacological effect.

## Chemistry

4-AcO-DMT can be obtained by acetylation of psilocin under alkaline or strongly acidic conditions. It is, therefore, a synthetic compound. 4-AcO-DMT is more resistant than psilocin to oxidation under basic conditions due to its acetoxy group. It is not as difficult as psilocybin to synthesize.
Given enough time in unfavorable conditions, 4-AcO-DMT can sometimes turn into a degraded form which is brown in color and can even progress into a brown/black tar-like substance. Researchers hypothesize this is a polymerization reaction and is said to have no effect on the potency of the substance. Preliminary GCMS analysis of the closely related homologue 4-AcO-DET suggests that this degraded form of 4-AcO-DMT consists mainly of the hydroxy form of the parent molecule.
4-AcO-DMT is a lower homologue of 4-AcO-MET, 4-AcO-DET, 4-AcO-MiPT and 4-AcO-DiPT. Other analogues of 4-AcO-DMT include 4-AcO-DPT, 4-MeO-DMT, and 4-PrO-DMT (O-propionylpsilocin).

## History

4-AcO-DMT and several other esters of psilocin were patented on January 16, 1963, by Sandoz Ltd via Albert Hofmann and Franz Troxler. Despite this, psilacetin remains a psychedelic compound with a limited history of use. It is theorized to be a prodrug of psilocin, as is psilocybin, which occurs naturally in many species of psychedelic mushrooms. This is because the aromatic acetyl moiety on the 4th position of the indole ring system is subject to deacetylation in acidic conditions such as those found in the stomach. Psilacetin is O-acetylated psilocin, whereas psilocybin is O-phosphorylated.
