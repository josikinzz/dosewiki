3C-P, also known as 4-propoxy-3,5-dimethoxyamphetamine or as α-methylproscaline (3C-proscaline), is a psychedelic drug of the phenethylamine, amphetamine, and 3C families related to 3,4,5-trimethoxyamphetamine (TMA). It is the amphetamine (3C) analogue of proscaline. The drug has been reported to have a dose range of 20 to 40 mg orally, with a typical dose estimate of 30 mg, based on informal anecdotal reports. Although 3C-P produces hallucinogenic effects, very little is known about its effects. The chemical synthesis of 3C-P has been described. 3C-P acts as a serotonin 5-HT2 receptor agonist, including of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor. It produces the head-twitch response, a behavioral proxy of psychedelic effects, in rodents. 3C-P was first described in the scientific literature by Otakar Leminger by 1972. Alexander Shulgin mentioned it in his 1991 book PiHKAL (Phenethylamines I Have Known and Loved) and Daniel Trachsel synthesized it in 2002 but neither reported its effects or properties. The drug has been sold online as a designer drug and was first detected in September 2013 in Finland.
