## Subjective Experience

IPPH is a structural analogue of methylphenidate. It appeared on the online markets
at the start of 2015, attracting mixed reviews, and was one of five phenidates
specifically banned in the UK in April of that year.

I tested it in January 2015, and posted the following report. At the time, most other
reports seemed to compare it to EPH, which was one of the most commonly used
legal phenidates of that period. I purposely avoided this approach, largely because I
subjectively felt that EPH was a little one-dimensional.

```
T+0:00 I begin the experiment by taking 25mg orally on a reasonably empty
stomach. Given that it is fairly late in the day, I am gambling that suggestions
that there is little residue-stim are correct. [5pm]
```
```
From the few reports posted so far, this does not seem to be a significant dose.
Note also that I have not sampled any chemicals for a week or so, although I
did drink a couple of beers last night.
```
```
The taste is not the worst, but chems are never really palatable.
```

```
T+0:30 Thirty minutes in, there is nothing to note.
```
```
T+1:15 Again, there is nothing particularly notable to report. I feel that I could
be slightly affected, but equally, this is so weak that it could be a placebo
effect.
```
```
As others report of full effects within an hour this is somewhat disappointing.
I therefore redose with a further 35mg. This takes me to the 60mg maximum I
had set aside at the outset.
```
```
T+2:15 It suddenly dawns on me: I am indeed under the influence.
```
```
It is subtle, mild, and doesn't create the same sort of buzz associated with the
currently popular stimulants. I can now see the relevance of third party
comments regarding focus and mind-only stimulation with little physical
effect.
```
```
Perhaps this escaped me on the earlier 25mg dose, as my expectation had
been firmly set on a more all embracing and traditional experience.
```
```
There is no euphoria, but there is a certain clarity, and gentle delivery.
```
```
T+3:00 To finish off I decide to insufflate a couple of lines, to establish if there
is a kick via this route. It appears to be kinder on the nose than substances like
EPH and 3-FPM.
```
```
T+3:30 There wasn't a kick, but perhaps the earlier effects are now a little
more pronounced.
```
```
I can also confirm that there is no significant dilation of the pupils, and that I
am experiencing no jaw tension.
```
I managed to sleep a few hours later, indicating that as expected residue-stimulation
from this chemical isn't excessive. I should also note that there was no horn, but on
the other side of the coin, no significant stim-dick either.

All in all this was a fairly pleasant experience with little body load, although I suspect
that the mind-set has to be correct to get the most out of it. If you are looking for an
all-firing high, or wired excitation, you will be disappointed. It does however seem to
be well suited to a situation in which broad functionality is required; perhaps when
having to endure a somewhat boring scenario or social event.

Another question is whether it could be used as a potentiator for other substances. It
has that sort of feel, but this is probably an area for comment by someone who is
more qualified to discuss the chemistry of combinations than I am.

Would I take it again? Yes I would, but in the right setting and with the correct
expectation.
