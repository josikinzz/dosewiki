2C-T-4, also known as 4-isopropylthio-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine, is a psychedelic drug of the phenethylamine and 2C families. It is taken orally.
2C-T-4 was first described in the scientific literature by Alexander Shulgin and colleagues in 1991. Shortly after this, Shulgin described 2C-T-17 in greater detail in his 1991 book PiHKAL (Phenethylamines I Have Known and Loved).

## Use and effects

In his book PiHKAL (Phenethylamines I Have Known and Loved), Alexander Shulgin lists 2C-T-4's dose range as 8 to 20 mg orally and its duration as 12 to 18 hours. Its onset is 30 minutes to 2 hours and peak effects occur after 3 hours. The effects of 2C-T-4 have been described and include psychedelic visuals among others. Shulgin devoted a chapter in the first part of PiHKAL to 2C-T-4, describing an intense "plus-four" experience on the Shulgin Rating Scale with a 12 mg dose.

## Interactions

2C drugs are metabolized by the monoamine oxidase (MAO) enzymes MAO-A and MAO-B. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) such as phenelzine, tranylcypromine, moclobemide, and selegiline may potentiate the effects of 2C drugs. This may result in overdose and serious toxicity.

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

2C-T-4 acts as a serotonin 5-HT2 receptor agonist, including of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor. The mechanism that produces 2C-T-4's hallucinogenic effects has not been specifically established, however it is most likely to result from 5-HT2A receptor activation in the brain, a mechanism of action shared by all of the hallucinogenic tryptamines and phenethylamines for which the mechanism of action is known.

## Chemistry

2C-T-4 is the 2-carbon homologue of Aleph-4. The full chemical name is 2-[4-(isopropylthio)-2,5-dimethoxyphenyl]-ethanamine. The drug has structural and pharmacodynamic properties similar to 2C-T-7 and 2C-T-19. A notable analogue of 2C-T-4 is the Ψ-PEA compound Ψ-2C-T-4.

### Synthesis

The chemical synthesis of 2C-T-4 has been described.

### Analogues

Analogues of 2C-T-4 include 2C-T, 2C-T-2, 2C-T-7, and Aleph-4, among others.

## History

2C-T-4 was first described in the scientific literature by Alexander Shulgin and colleagues in a journal article in 1991. Shortly thereafter, it was described in greater detail by Shulgin in his 1991 book PiHKAL (Phenethylamines I Have Known and Loved).
