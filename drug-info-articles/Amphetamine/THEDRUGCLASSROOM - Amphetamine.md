# Adderall
*Source: https://thedrugclassroom.com/video/adderall/*

Adderall is a combination of dextroamphetamine and levoamphetamine that is commonly prescribed for ADHD. It effectively combats ADHD in many people, and in healthy users, it can provide an acute cognitive boost. Because of its cognition enhancing and stimulant properties, adderall is commonly used by students and workers.

In normal medical settings with a common medical dose, adderall doesn’t appear to be notably harmful and it appears useful (at least on a time scale of 1-2 years) in those with ADHD.

The drug can provide wakefulness and improve attentiveness, motivation, cognitive performance, and physical performance. Outside of medical settings, tolerance will usually kick in quickly and remove many of the beneficial effects.
