# Huperzine A
*Source: https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB04864*

## Overview

### Description

This compound belongs to the class of organic compounds known as quinolones and derivatives. These are compounds containing a quinoline moiety which bears a ketone group.

### Background

Huperzine A, is a naturally occurring sesquiterpene alkaloid found in the extracts of the firmoss
Huperzia serrata
. The botanical has been used in China for centuries for the treatment of swelling, fever and blood disorders. Recently in clinical trials in China, it has demonstrated neuroprotective effects. It is currently being investigated as a possible treatment for diseases characterized by neurodegeneration – particularly Alzheimer’s disease.

### Indication

Investigated for use/treatment in alzheimer's disease.

### Pharmacodynamics

Huperzine A is an alkaloid derived from
Huperzia serrata
(which is available as an herbal product in the US). It is under investigation as an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. Clinical trials in China have shown that huperzine A is comparably effective to the drugs currently on the market, and may even be somewhat safer in terms of side effects.

### Mechanism of Action

Acetylcholinesterase
Inhibitor

### Drug Interactions

This information should not be interpreted without the help of a healthcare provider. If you believe you are experiencing an interaction, contact a healthcare provider immediately. The absence of an interaction does not necessarily mean no interactions exist.

Acebutolol
Huperzine A may increase the bradycardic activities of Acebutolol.
Acetylcholine
The risk or severity of adverse effects can be increased when Huperzine A is combined with Acetylcholine.
Aclidinium
Huperzine A may increase the neuromuscular blocking activities of Aclidinium.
Alprenolol
Huperzine A may increase the bradycardic activities of Alprenolol.
Amantadine
The therapeutic efficacy of Amantadine can be decreased when used in combination with Huperzine A.

### General Function

Catalyzes the oxygenation of arachidonate ((5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z)-eicosatetraenoate) to 5-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoate (5-HPETE) followed by the dehydration to 5,6- epoxyeicosatetraenoate (Leukotriene A4/LTA4), the first two steps in the biosynthesis of leukotrienes, which are potent mediators of inflammation (PubMed:19022417, PubMed:21233389, PubMed:22516296, PubMed:23246375, PubMed:24282679, PubMed:24893149, PubMed:31664810, PubMed:8615788, PubMed:8631361). Also catalyzes the oxygenation of arachidonate into 8-hydroperoxyicosatetraenoate (8-HPETE) and 12-hydroperoxyicosatetraenoate (12-HPETE) (PubMed:23246375). Displays lipoxin synthase activity being able to convert (15S)-HETE into a conjugate tetraene (PubMed:31664810). Although arachidonate is the preferred substrate, this enzyme can also metabolize oxidized fatty acids derived from arachidonate such as (15S)-HETE, eicosapentaenoate (EPA) such as (18R)- and (18S)-HEPE or docosahexaenoate (DHA) which lead to the formation of specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPM) lipoxin and resolvins E and D respectively, therefore it participates in anti-inflammatory responses (PubMed:17114001, PubMed:21206090, PubMed:31664810, PubMed:32404334, PubMed:8615788). Oxidation of DHA directly inhibits endothelial cell proliferation and sprouting angiogenesis via peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) (By similarity). It does not catalyze the oxygenation of linoleic acid and does not convert (5S)-HETE to lipoxin isomers (PubMed:31664810). In addition to inflammatory processes, it participates in dendritic cell migration, wound healing through an antioxidant mechanism based on heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) regulation expression, monocyte adhesion to the endothelium via ITGAM expression on monocytes (By similarity). Moreover, it helps establish an adaptive humoral immunity by regulating primary resting B cells and follicular helper T cells and participates in the CD40-induced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) after CD40 ligation in B cells through interaction with PIK3R1 that bridges ALOX5 with CD40 (PubMed:21200133). May also play a role in glucose homeostasis, regulation of insulin secretion and palmitic acid-induced insulin resistance via AMPK (By similarity). Can regulate bone mineralization and fat cell differentiation increases in induced pluripotent stem cells (By similarity)
