# MDA
*Source: https://thedrugclassroom.com/video/mda/*

MDA is an entactogen and stimulant that can provide some psychedelic effects. It’s often compared to MDMA, which it resembles in many ways. They differ in that MDA is usually more stimulating, more psychedelic, and lasts a little longer.

The drug has been used recreationally since the 1960s and research began earlier in the 1900s. Much like MDMA, it may be useful in psychotherapy.

Neurotoxicity is a concern with the substance, which is why minimizing your use, taking common doses, keeping your temperature low, and supplementing are important.
