I am on both Lyrica and Valium and experience significant cross-tolerance, so don't get your hopes up.  I have found that all GABAgeric drugs to form tolerances really quickly, at least in my body. All I can suggest is that you try for a short acting benzo and only use it when absolutely necessary.

**beginner lyrica question**


ive got a couple of question regarding lyrica dosage.........docter suggest to split lyrica into 2 times daily but is it better to take it all at once.......whats best dosage for a beginner begin at 150 for the first couple of day then 300 and the 600 or should i go for 600 the first time...........i know that at lower dose it takes about a week to fully kick in but at larger dose for example 600 mg does it still take a week to kick in or you feel it right away............im gonna take it for anxiety  and of course for the buzz do you suggest i take it everyday or only when needed so tolerance could theorically be controlled?????

start as low as possible.  150mg a day should be fine.  work your way up to 300 when you find tolerance kick in.

150mg of lyrica? You might as well drink a cup of coffee and have a cookie. 


I would say 300mg would be a good starting dose for someone not tolerant to GABAergics. Also, this isn't an anti-depressant, you don't need to wait a long period of time to feel its effects. We're talking about recreational drugs, lyrica takes a long time to kick in and that is 1-1.5hours oral. I have a mild GABA tolerance and find 900-1200mg a good dose but have taken 2400mg before and had fun so I wouldn't say you are at risk of ODing and having a bad time. In any case you sound like you would really benefit from some drug/lyrica education so read the lyrica/pregabalin megathread and whatever you can on here. The only real negative side effect I have experienced when you are at the 1000mg plus range is joint pain.


I would think 450 would be recreational for someone like you with 300 being conservative but hey if 300 or 225 (I gather you have 75mg tabs) even works for you then great. The problem with starting low is that the half life is 5-6 hours and it takes a while to kick in so by the time you wait and don't feel much then wait for it to kick in your system has eliminated a decent amount, so start somewhere reasonable. Definitely don't start below 200 and feel free to go up to 600.

you really dont need 300mg starting off. 150 is just fine.  ymmv though.  tolerance starts FAST with this shit so it doesnt make any sense to start higher than you need too.

do you mean a short acting benzo OR to use a benzo short term?  huge dif.


i think a long acting benzo used short term would be best.


ive taken 150-600mg of lyrica a day for 2 months without any wd besides feeling a little amotivated, spaced out in addition to how i felt before starting it.


the shit is fucking awesome.  but in the end it made me feel worse.


i would much rather have it work again than take shitty ass xanax and/or klonopin. that shit kill my anxiety but makes me crash cars.

Recommending a person start at 300mg is not a good idea. Lyrica is a weird drug. When I was first prescribed it, 1 75mg capsule would do me good. Taking 900-1200mg of Lyrica in a day is insane and is just asking for problems. Please remember, this is harm reduction. Not "lets get high" forum. 8)

I'm just throwing my personal experience out there and even the first post talks about a 900mg experience and then advocates shooting the stuff, which we know to be very dangerous. I also have mixed a decent amount of booze, benzos, and in some cases opioids at 1000 and even 2000mg+ doses but I don't endorse that especially since theraputic dose lyrica could have played a small role in my fentanyl OD. 


Anyway, 99% of threads on here are about recreational use, aka "lets get high but let's not die", so in a huge sense it is one- no reason to pretend otherwise.  There are a small number of threads for recovering addicts and people who have genuine "on label" questions but they fall into that 1% or less which is not what he was talking about. I guess if you have a lot available you should consider starting low, but a bottle of lyrica goes really fast when you are using it to get high more than once a week.


Maybe the sensitivity thing has to do with what people perceive as the lyrica high. I notice a lot of people talk about very mild effects like slight mood lift and anxiety reduction. That sounds like every benzo dose I have ever taken and pretty boring. I guess those people fall into the group who find the benzo "high" recreational. I never have, and the appeal that lyrica had was that it can go beyond what any benzo can and I consider myself high only once the floor and everything around me starts undulating and I see colored lighting and become MDMA level social with a strong weightless feeling body high. For me that is only at 900mg+; At 450mg I might feel the same effects you consider a "high" from your lyrica experience. If you don't get the effects I describe then double your recreational dose and report back, you may have a very different opinion.


I use lyrica only as prescribed these days and it also happens to have an edge on and becomes synergistic with benzos for treating normal symptoms like anxiety and depression- but I would not call my 300mg dose recreational; I woudln't even notice it when I would go a few weeks without taking it.

Yeah dude, for a hardened drug addict such as myself 150 is low, but after seeing friends try this shit, 1 75mg capsule is plenty to roally fuck you up, especially if you are using multiple drugs or alcohol.

I would agree that the dosing with lyrica is highly variable.

My first time taking it I was on high dose opiates & took 150mg, it synergized nicely & worked great.

The next time I took it I was on a maintenance dose of opiates, went with 300mg & had an interesting high.

I've yet to take it on it's own & considering my current opiate dependency am unlikely to do so in the near future.

What I've noticed with it so far is that it's great for synergizing with other drugs.


Seeing as I've had a shit day (friend got baited & switched on a bun for me)

I'm actually considering throwing some into tonight's cocktail but always have a hard time deciding on the dose.

Regardless, it's besides the point just wanted to throw in the comments on variability & lyrica's great synergistic properties.

I use it for both purposes. 

Recreational use will ruin its therapeutic potential so be careful if using large amounts more than once a week.

I find that to get "high" I need amounts on par with what Oxymorphone is suggesting, but "high" is subjective and I am used to doing a bunch of oxymorphone (the drug not the Bluelight member), so to get "high" requires a large amount of Lyrica and even then it's not that recreational. 

I would say that 75-150mg is a good starting point if you find that benzo's do you well, and 300-600mg like OM said if benzo's don't really get you that high.


Oh and as far as using recreationally, the Pregabalin capsules can be opened, dissolved in water, and filtered to be added to a nasal solution with an opiate or MDMA (or both as in this past weekend) if you want a faster/ easier to titrate high.

^often people have claimed around here that there will be some cross-tolerance but everything I've read says that there isn't. As you pointed out, they have very different mechanisms of action.

I am still curious what different people consider 'high' with lyrica. I just can't imagine it being possible to get near what I described above with such low doses, especially now that a couple people pointed out there is no link between benzo and pregabalin tolerance, which would mean the 900-1200mg range I needed to get a real high would apply to anyone with no tolerance. I stand by that anything under 450mg you might as well eat a cookie and that is conservative where I don't notice anything under 600.


With that being said anyone else notice joint pain when taking high doses, both starting around the time it peaks and lingering well into the next day? Any idea why this happens?

well I know Baclofen is used to treat joint pain and I think it is a reverse isomer of GABA, so that could explain the joint pain.

I just don't think Lyrica is that recreational.

I have gone to Clemson for five years (yeah super senior I know), and have extensive experience with lyrica. 


At first I could take 100mg and colors would pop and mesh so nicely and I just floated through the world. But as everyone here has noted, tolerance came on quickly and the effects are quite variable from person to person. I have, on several occasions, taken doses I wouldn't feel now and been scarily screwed up, twitching and all. But that doesn't happen anymore, and I can take 3g of it and feel less good than if I take 500mg. I don't know why this is.


I also have not ever had any significant withdrawal effects to mention, but I have only been taking it a 3-5x a week and not everyday (for a year).


For anyone that does not have experience with lyrica please start LOW. You can always easily take more, and although I don't think you'd have any serious health problems you can become very uncomfortable and wished youd never taken it. 


Be safe and have fun!

I am interested to hear your thoughts specifically because I, too, am on both Lyrica and Valium (450mg and 20mg/day, respectively) as well as 30mg of Restoril (temazepam) at night for sleep, and I cant say that I've ever noticed Lyrica to promote the tolerance I've held to benzos for 9 years.

> Another reason this confuses me is because when I began Lyrica about 3 mos. ago, 75-100mg of it would produce a "high" much the same as ~600mg does now. But if benzo tolerance can affect Lyrica tolerance, then it should have taken me a much higher starting dose of Lyrica to feel that way, wouldn't you think?

yeah, i guess I didn't phrase that right. 

People who do not typically experience a "high" from benzos will need more Pregabalin to feel "high" while people who get super fucked up from 1 or 2 valium will only need a bit. 

I don't think cross-tolerance was the right term, but there is similar trends in the actions of GABAgeric drugs within populations of people.


and as far as my body, I can take a break from my diazapam and switch to pregabalin without any BZD withdrawals, and vice-versa. Although I never really experience severe benzo WD's.

I just can't imagine it being possible to get near what I described above with such low doses, especially now that a couple people pointed out there is no link between benzo and pregabalin tolerance, which would mean the 900-1200mg range I needed to get a real high would apply to anyone with no tolerance. I stand by that anything under 450mg you might as well eat a cookie and that is conservative where I don't notice anything under 600.

my high of 300mg (hig tolerance) is like being drunk but feelling much better.

up to 600mg very talkative and enjoying everything. +1g it's like a little trip, colors are so amazing, I got kind of CEV and it's very enjoyable.


and remember this is with high tolerance so somebody with no tolerance would be much lower.


by the way I changed lyrica for Metamizol for my fyro and it work better!!

taking some xanax ER and clonazepam too :S

**taking lyrica at night works better the next day**


this is the conlusion of the experiment i have conducted the last few nights.


after several months i no longer felt good from the drug. i felt like shit.  i took some at night in efforts to get high and noticed i felt really good the next day.  i have been doing this every night for a week and feel like when i first started taking it.  


i would suggest trying it and telling me the results.

I'm of the ones who can't get high on benzos. Even Rohypnol left me pretty unimpressed - though that was a bit fun. I started out with very large doses of Lyrica as when I first came across these pills I didn't even know they had any use. So I was taking like 7-10 300 mgs for my first tries. After that I cut it back to 4-5, mainly cause of cost of taking these amounts regularly.


But I think the key to recreational Lyrica use is to keep it to once a week. When I first started out I only did it once a week, as I believed they were only effective that way, and would get REALLY fucked up from doing 7-10 300 mgs a night, also from having no tolerance. That was also my strongest experience of the drug. 


This might not be possible for those who feel the need to take it more frequently, for whatever reason. If you enjoy it too much to keep it that rare, be aware how much effects will decline with near-daily use, and become more like an antidepressant or anxiety reliever than something to get fucked up from. Though I think it would be wise both with Lyrica and Neurontin, if just to avoid the HORRIFIC 10 DAY WD you go through after getting addicted to this drug (kind of like a combined opiate/benzo WD).

It has been reported by several that taking their dose and going to bed got them waking up feeling beautiful...of course...still finding themselves in the middle of a Lyrica high. Makes sense as a Lyrica high can last for over 12 hours and so how you're still going feel when you wake up. Though the effects should last not too long after waking

I quited Lyrica. I went a weed at a sort of pain hospital. and they gave me Buprenorphine at low dose 0.4mg with some Clonazepam and Lorazepam if I need more. and it does the trick.


No withdrawal felt from my 4 month non stop use of lyrica. Probably covered by the substance above. 


Too bad for this medication :'( I like it a lot. I keep a little 800mg for a last recreational use.

Have anyoe noticed that when you take Lyrica opiates don't seem to work as well the day after? Like,you can take more than you did before the day you took it and still feel less? Of course on the day you take Lyrica they are great as they so greatly potentiate it.


Seems like Lyrica cancels itself out on the next day, so maybe this goes for other depressant as well? At least opiates are almost a waste to take for me, or just enough to avoid withdrawals. Anyone else noticed this with any other drugs?

my only hope of being able to form a sentence is stopping this shit for a week. i tried 4 days and it helped a little at first but its not enough.  i need a benzo in order to take a break or i get so anxious i cant talk. 


ive heard that 1-2 weeks is enough to revert tolerance, but ive heard more variations from others too.  can everyone tell me if its possible to regain the efficiency of this stuff and if so how long you need to wait. i would like to take an average of what people say to get a figure. thanks,

I can take 600mg to get high enough that i shouldn't be in public.. e.g loss of coordination and dexterity of motion. but i can cut that to 450 or 500 with equal or better effects in synergy with marijuana. The stuff is a wonderland for synergy. I could sustain that same ceiling with small variation of effects for a week before they declined any significant amount.

For what it's worth, I took an 8 week break after my CT detox. Bizarelly, after this it seemed completely ineffective on me, took me weeks to get weened into it working again. Maybe the CT did so much damage my body it wanted to reject the chemical. Seems to be working like before now though.

Iv'e done some reading into this.... long story short im trying to get off benzos, and also have pain issues, does anyone have this perscribed for anxiety disorders? I'm keen to give this one a go, Says its a less kind of addictive thing than benzos for example, but i see a lot of people sayin they get fucked up offa it. So whats the story? overuse lead to WD's if so surley not as bad as benzos. I also use op8s, and have seen the list of interactions this has with other drugs, Would it be safe to be on this andd continue to have the occasional oxy or codeine etc?

My doc prescribed this to me along with 40mg of Valium... as a taper from 2mg of Klonopin a day... but he gave me no guidelines on how much of this stuff to take, I don't think he even knows... Has anybody done a taper off of benzos with Lyrica? Is this is even smart? It seems like I would just get addicted to the Lyrica, which is more expensive, and probably has the same or worse withdrawals???

False on same or worse withdrawals. Benzodiazepines are known to have much worse withdrawal, but some people here have reported some nasty pregabalin withdrawals for sure.

i took 900mg last night and it didnt do ANYTHING. i mean seriously, nothing! wow.


i dont have a choice but to get on low dose klonopin now. even if it takes 2 weeks before i can use lyrica again ill do it. the stuff is fucking great for anxiety. i wouldnt say that you get a tolerance to it, it just stops working. i never really had to go above 300mg for it to help but at around 2 months it stopped working.


oh my god, all this shit about it being worse than benzos and opiates combined as far as wd is absurd. the only wd ive felt from it is feeling crappy, which is how i feel when i dont take any medication at all.  its not very bad. nothing compared to what ive heard being to xanax is like.  it would be excellent for tapering off of benzos.  there is no way you would get addicted to it if you used it for a month or less.  it takes at least a month of daily use to get addicted to benzos or opioids so i would think the same carries here.  even after 3 months im not addicted to it.


the problem lays within taking HUGE recreational doses.  after 4 months of taking 900mg a day yes you are going to be uncomfortable when you stop.  but the same would apply for any C-V med.  take assloads of codeine syrup everyday for several months and guess what.  not gonna feel good.

@ hdpt, ive been taking lyrica for around 1.5 years~, and generally if i wanted recreational effects after a period of ..recreational dosing(?), then it would take about 3 weeks of non-use, usually 4 or so though to feel any of the anaxiolytic and euphoric properties again.


   It feels like.. 

Well, I would compare it to how benzodiazepines generally produce anxiety relief and therapeutic benefit at lower doses than needed for hypnotic effects, whereas, pregabalin produces anxiety relief (it's closest-related GABAergic-type effect) lower than needed to produce it's 'high'. 


In conclusion, you get the 'high' back before it regains it's carelessness and somewhat uplifting properties..the GABAergic-feel part, which kind of sucks.

**Lyrica & its Dissociative Properties**


I've been taking Lyrica for about 3 months (150mg twice a day) to help with a case of Complex Regional Pain Syndrome caused by an injury to the nerves in my arm. I'm taking other medications as well for pain, such as methadone (all prescribed) but my pain has been much reduced by physical therapy, and in the last few weeks has approached normal levels, w/ only occasional breakthrough pain, so I can resume my normal life (go back to school :D). Because my pain has become so manageable in recent weeks I've been able to experiment very cautiously w/ Lyrica for its alleged recreational potential, reasoning that I'm not ever liable to have the opportunity again.


SO...after that long intro, I want to ask: Has anyone felt that Lyrica, has almost a mild but definite dissociative quality (think LOW 2nd plateau DXM)? On the two occasions that I've experimented with it, I've found that apart from the weightless feelings and the anxiolytic effects, (at doses between 450-600) it can also cause feelings of deep introspection. If one sits down in a darkened room, with a sheet over ones face, it can lead to unique CEV's and pseudo-visionary qualities, feeling as though your peering into another universe. Also, these visions seems to be so immersive that they can evoke delusional thoughts or ideas, which are recognized as such, but still seem plausible. For example, after seeing what looked like a number of slowly dancing white fairies on the floating sheets of glass (with my face under a pillow), I began to briefly entertain the notion that elves were controlling my immediate universe. Has anyone else had similar experiences? I have found the CEV's on Lyrica (such as incredibly complex buildings, structures, and machinery) to be very enveloping in a dissociative-esqe way. 


Has anyone else had similar experiences?

I recon I have a high tolerance for lyrica since I have been on max dose on neruotin and a lot of other similar "Painkillers" so after I got my 100x75mg pack instead of 56x75 pack I decided to go from 50mg at morning and 75mg at night to 750mg ^^ Feeling awsome at the moment nice calm high sorta like when your drunk but not to drunk . Im only worried how long this will last? Doc said it works for 12 hours how long does the high last?

To update on my 900mg - I ended up finishing the entire bottle... so 19 pills at 50mg each - 950mg - I ended up just blacking out and waking up in my bed.


Never really got anything that I can call a "euphoria" - in fact, it was a huge waste. I don't think I'll bother with my last three bottles.

Gone try a dose of 300 ( The dose I can take with out "abuse" ( 300 morning/night) Then work my way up 75mg /houer to see the results. Anyone know if lyrica is deposit? And can be extracted to get bigger effect on a shorter period? What I learned so fare myself is if you do a big dose very late at night you dont work to well the next day. 


Last night I got "Seasick" watching a car chase in a movie.

lyrica is addicting? Im suppose to take 600mg/day on a good day, right now I only got tramadol as a "Upper" on a bad day but probably get something els that dont interact to much with lyrica soon.  ( Sorta hit a wall after prescript abuse and busted for using cannabis thats really above heroin dealers on the wanted list over here.


quick update. For me I dident fell the effect of lyrica until I got to 675mg and hit the sweet spot at 700mg ( got 75 and 25 tablets) It accrued to me that many things can interact with how much you need to get "Buzzed" ore start felling pain relief. Like and please correct me if Im wrong.

Pain ;sidenote: I know for a fact that fucks up your cannabis use

Try taking it every 2 or 3 days. I don't feel it at all when I take it every day. Seems like it needs a day to wash out of your system so you can feel it again.

so is it unamimous that there is no way to get it to work again after youve been on it a few months?  i would think taking 1 week off would allow it to work again. is this the case or not?

um, yeah you could use google.  or you could use a refined search engine like bluelight or....maybe....use the forums on BL to get information from the people that have actually used the drug.


banging it is not a good idea. i did it a couple times. there is talc in it.  fuck that shit.


went to dr. i weight 155. i weighed 142 last month. same scale, same shoes. WOW. this is what lyrica does to you. and i couldnt even figure out how much weight i had gained because my brain has turned to mush from being on it.


this and the fact that in the monograph it states that rats taking lyrica had children with deformities(male rats!!!!!) makes me want to never touch it again.


the problem is that im now on klonopin, which of course is the SHIT for anxiety....i really preferred lyrica to it when i first started.  i refuse to become addicted and tolerant to benzos as well.


therefore, i would still like to use it 1week out of the month in order to never take kpins for a month straight, which i believe is how long it takes to get addicted.  taking 1 full week off every month should keep the tolerance down too.  


just a shame that even after being able to possibly get the wonderful effects of lyrica back i can only do it for like a month straight before id have to stop again for another month....ah, western medicine.


why can i just drink some opium tea everyday like my great uncle?

**Watch out for withdrawal, friend**


I've been taking Lyrica off and on for a year -- prescribed for residual nerve pain/siatic damage from a seriously fucked up back. 


Yes you get high for a while. Yes it wears off. Then ... when you run out of pills .... the withdrawal is horrible. 


I've gone through opiate withdrawals several times (currently on suboxone, tapered down to 8 mg ![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif)) and this is just as bad. Suicidal thoughts ![8o](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eek.gif), pain, restlessness, anxiety through the roof. I wanted to die. On some levels it was worse than opiate withdrawal. 


Pls keep this in mind and try not to run out of pills. Even if it's recreational for you the fall is hard and it hurts.

Like someone else said, I wouldn't wish Lyrica WD on my worst enemy. I've gone through opiate WD and thought this was the worst a drug had to offer. A combination between an opiate and benzo WD sounds about right. I've never been through benzo WD before and didn't know how bad it could be. Mentally, it feels worse, the feelings of anxiety, psychosis, and suicidal depression are just worse. But what really scared me was how fucked up my body felt on a  fundamental level. I was scared I was going to have a seizure, and have also read about this occurring. 


[http://www.prohealth.com/library/showarticle.cfm?libid=11421](http://www.prohealth.com/library/showarticle.cfm?libid=11421)


This is about an old woman who experienced swelling in the part of the brain that is affected in some epileptic patients who suddenly stop their drugs. Sounds about right, as when I stopped cold turkey I lost parts of my memory about  week into my WD, it didn't return until I got a full night's sleep. I was really scared and had to have my dad take me to the ER. Though this is more or less pointless if you don't tell them you're suffering from withdrawal from this drug. It's so bad that I would suggest anyone who gets into that situation go to their doctor and own up so they can get a taper. 


This is not something I would normally suggest as I don't think it would be worth it, not just for an opiate withdrawal. But opiate WD isn't life threatening and doesn't leave you as emotionally crushed as Lyrica WD does. At least you can feel an improvement from day to day, but Lyrica WD doesn't start to improve until after 10 days, and, trust me, you REALLY don't want to stay in that state for that long. I'm sick of seeing people claim there are no withdrawals to this drug because they haven't used it for long enough or in large enough doses. Go through the cold turkey withdrawals before you advice people about it.

Like I've said before, for me it only works if I leave one or two days in between. It has never worked for me when taken every day, ever, in fact a few weeks ago I was trying to make it work the next day by taking 8 300 mgs as I really needed it, and NOTHING. So it seems like a drug that can only be effective, whether therapeuticlly or recreationlly, when not taken every day and leaving it to one day a week and avoiding withdrawals would probably be best. 


There IS a great therapeutic effect from Lyrica, but not when you take it every day. Though it seems to be effecting people somewhat differently, kind of like benzos, and for some it can be effective when taken every day for a period of time. I've never been able to get high on benzos and maybe that's why I have a higher tolerance towards Lyrica. Still, it seems the therapeutic effect eventually runs out for all. 


I wouldn't give up on this drug, though, as it's SO effective as a mood lifter/anxiety reliever, when it does work, just wouldn't rely on it to work consistently over time. It's not like opiates, which only lose their effect very slowly over time.

I take normal recreational doses. 300mg will give me tremors. Usually I dose twice  a day. Once in the morning, once at night. I'm just constantly twitching on this drug. I shake too, makes it hard to talk.

People have no fear, Lyrica is a wonder drug by all means, I find it as just as addictive as a nice BZP, only that going cold turkey Lyrica is manageable, BZP not.

I wonder if the patent on Pregabalin has already expired.

**Lyrica (Pregabalin)**


I was recently prescribed the drug Lyrica (pregabalin) for muscle and nerve pain and I must say that it delivers the best high I have ever felt.  I have read that most people cannot get a high from pregabalin, but for me it acts like pure MDMA combined with a fairly strong opiate.  I usually take ~ 1 gram about twice a week for full effect as the prescribed dosage of 150 mg twice daily basically doesn't do anything at all.  Another great attribute of Lyrica is that the high lasts all day (12 hours or more).  I can take some, go to sleep and have some crazy good dreams, wake up, and still be high for 4 hours.  To me there is nothing better, and I've tried pretty much everything chemical-wise.


  Also, I have read and heard that Neurontin (gabapentin) delivers roughly the same effect as Lyrica and is much cheaper, but if you have decent insurance I figure it doesn't matter much what drug you get.  You aren't likely to find either of these drugs on the street I'm afraid unless you get very lucky, so getting a scrip is probably your best bet.


Anyway, has anyone else here had any positive experiences with either Lyrica or Neurontin?  Just wondering if I'm the only one who's felt this phenomenal from taking it.


Thanks. ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

The euphoria really seems to vary between people for pregs. I really enjoy the stuff too. 750mg is a nice dose imo. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I enjoy Lyrica very much.  150mg gives me a nice little high while 300mg gets me crazy high.  Anything above 300mg and I'm usually unable to walk and see straight.  ;P

1gram of lyrica allowed me to sleep for 7 hours straight, which is a real rarity for me haha. (I'm a 284lb male now)


I don't know how I've been losing weight lol, just not eating as much I guess. I was 320 not to long ago ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

I tried this stuff tonight for the first time, and am feeling pretty euphoric after 2 and a half hours after a pretty low dose (300mg) I am torn between taking another 150mg as i know I can feel waay better on this stuff than I am now (I can just tell ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)) or waiting a week or so and trying it again at a higher dose.

fuck, I had taken 750 mg after not taking any of this for a month and didn't even feel anything at all. I could walk perfectly straight, no euophoria, it just served as a bit of a social lubricant. What do I do now...?

and if you're wondering, I have not really abused this in the past, the most I've done before this was about 450 mgs, and that was like once every week, if that.

I've been prescribed this recently for anxiety and have to say that after finding this thread and experimenting myself I've found that Lyrica is a very interesting drug. I get some real nice music appreciation off low doses at around 225/300mg. For me it kinda feels like I'm stoned, got a nice warm feeling inside, it's been AMAZING for Zopiclone w/d, I've had no ill effects when I should of been in hell. Lyrica has saved me from that. ![8o](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eek.gif) I wonder if it would be good for Opiate w/d too?, I would love to get off my 8mg Subutex daily.


Negative side effects are my memory, it's definitely taken a turn for the worse, I forget the most simplest things like my phone number etc.

I had hurt myself and a friend offered me some pain pills. They were Lyrica which I had heard of but I didn't know shit about. I took some. Wow. I was high as shit with open and closed eye visuals at the peak, stumbling around like I was drunk as shit while feeling excellent. It is the next day and I am still kind of fucked up.. reminds me of Phenibut with the day after effects.


I have been doing drugs for a long time and it surprises me I had never came across this shit before.. I was not expecting to get high, let alone that high ![8o](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eek.gif)


I got an excellent nights sleep as well..


Interesting stuff..

I just started taking Lyrica at night and I've woken up each time with horrible stomach pains as I was trying to eat breakfast. So bummed because Neurontin wasn't really doing much for me. Has anyone experienced this? Think it might pass? The drug makes me feel like I'm "falling" as I'm trying to get to sleep just like opiates do to me. I swear I can feel a difference in my leg pain, even if it's tiny. I'm just seeing that stomach pain is one of those adverse reactions =\ No fever, though.

I've read the previous Lyrica Megathread intensively, all the while biting my tongue. I understand we all want our questions answered directly (and please take no offense), but your question has most likely been answered in the previous thousand posts if you just skim over the pages. It's irritating to an avid reader/user to see the same horse be beaten over and over and over. IMO (and please correct me if im wrong) things like:

1. Highs/BA/Synergies/etc. 

2. Withdrawls

3. Being a taper for other withdrawls

4. Gabapentin vs. Pregabalin (the consensus being gabapentin to lyrica is like comparing cocaine to meth - in as direct context as possible)

and to an extent 5. Prescription availabilities

Have all been thoroughly discussed in the first mthread!!

However what i haven't seen a whole lot of are like, off topic but very useful inquires such as:

1. Brain Plasticity

2. Motor skill functions on and after usage

3. The other great properties of lyrica not approved by the government

And im sure many more i just cant think of any.


But to sum it up to this point, i think @homeydontplaythat came in FTW:


"well, today is a very sad day indeed. lyrica....has stopped working. fuck, im about to cry.


i took 300mg today and felt HORRIBLE. i cant concentrate, im irritable as fuck, i just feel angry and stupid. 


i dont have high hopes that it will work again either. from what i read, this is it. i will try taking a break for a full 10 days though, as the shit was AWESOME for my anxiety and depression.


but now....it just makes me feel worse. im so sad. i just feel like a mess on it now. i can concentrate, make typos when typing, get incredibly angry really quickly, and its actually creating anxiety.


i dont have any wds when i stop but i just feel so amotivaed and a little depressed. however, its not worth feeling motivated and yet not doing able to do anything because i get so frustrated. its not worth being less depressed but not able to think straight.


**this shit really fucks with you. ive never seen a drug do such a 180.

**

to lyrica users out there.....does it start working again if you take a break....and HOW LONG OF A BREAK. i tried 3 days and that didnt do shit. sigh, i dont know....i doooont want to take a benzo. i was so hoping this was the answer......now i have to consider xanax and klonopin again? fuck me."


You be the judges! Again forgive me for being on a high horse and if i was offensive at any time ill have no problem stepping down. I just thought that if i were to throw 2 cents in this is the time, i hope i helped as a fellow user!!!

I use pregs often, got then in pure powder and doses 500-900 usally. Takes 1.30-2hr to hit, reminds me of weed aalittle.  Works well for keeping off other drugs like opiates and gbl. Do not snort, ime it is2% ba or summit.

also for severe pain i've used dextromethorphan ibuprofen and small doses of diphenhydramine mixed together taken at seperate times so that the dxm kicks in around the time the benadryl makes u sleepy the dxm can in most people act as a slight upper... the mixture of these drugs taken in the right amounts will take away any pain..  especially toothaches..

Lyrica gives a better buzz than neurontin, but not for long it seems.  Painkilling effects didn't last long either.  I just got off the junk and feel better without it for some reason.  I also gained about 25lbs. on the shit.

I tried this for the first time but didn't really feel anything positive from it.  (600mg)  I only got the side effects such as losing my balance a bit.


I was hoping for something at that dose and was hoping for an effect some what similar to Phenibut which I use once a week to good effect.

**well**


this is my first post here. I had been using opiates pretty heavily and quit and have been clean for three weeks but felt extremely anxious and the w/d's seemed never ending. So I took 3 75 mg capsules of Lyrica about 2 hours ago...I feel decent, kind of more aware of sounds and a light benzo-ish feeling. My question is after 3 75 mg caps and 2 300 mg caps of neurontin should I not take anymore today. I'm thinking one more capsule and I'll be done but I dont want to over do it as I am going out later tonight. Does weight have anything to do with tolerance and how much of this stuff you can take before you cant funtion in public? Thanks.

i did try 300. actually it hit me off guard and threw me into a dreamcoma on the sofa for 3 hours.dont know if thats a normal reaction but it was quite nice. had no tolerance to any meds or anything at the moment so it was quite intense...good though.

first time i took lyrica it were 2 75mgs , took em, half an hour later fell asleep for almost 20 hours.now when i take  1 300mg, it makes me feel my bupe , even though i get the same dose since 2 months and normally dont feel it.if i take a couple 300`s i get.....dont know how to describe it...maybe like couple benzos plus a couple beers?? yeah think that comes the closest. but still benzos are way better......and wayyyy less dangerous!!

ok, had another try of this. I got the 150mg caps.

after 150mg I feel already a lot, slightly like being drunk and somehow it really reminds me of gbl, my speech and walking is quite affected.


when I take another 150mg the effects get much stronger and it literally puts me to sleep. I sleep very long after this and waking up is very difficult. am awake now for an hour and feel very smashed...


I like it as a recreational thing... still got a full pack of 64x150mg caps and that will last me for a long time...

How so?  How long were you on it and what were you taking daily?   I use gbl in sessions of 500ml 24/7 and take a break after three weeks and take 1200 mg per day for a week to kill the g withdrawals.    


I severed the big nerve just under the elbow when I almost lost my arm a few years ago,  and although they could reconnect the nerve,  it didntt join up as it should with the result that I have dead spots where I feel nothing on my arm,  but  around my wrist and for five inches above the pain response is much  more acute than the othe arm,  and if i pinch the skin its literally agony.


The pregabalin really reduces this hypersensitivity and also helps with my back pain (two discs removed)  and every other pain.   My knees are pretty shite, but with pregabalin,  I can actually jog and get zero pain response from the knees or the back.   Its very helpful for me in this regard.     But I usually end up taking the whole 84 200 caps over a week as I like the high.   But it is true that it dissipates after two days,  so its only really usefulf for getting stoned for this period of time.


If I stick at the recommended dose for anxiety of 200mg x 3 times a day.  I have no cognitive impairment.  But if I take up to 800 per day as tolerance builds,  I have massive cognitive problems and physical problems like shaking hands and slurred speech,  and my legs feel like they are made of lead,  literally.   I find it difficult to walk - I also stagger like a drunk when I take up to 1200mg per  day.


I was taking 1000 per day when I had panic attacks about starting a new job, and the result was that I remembered nothing from my handover and training.  Absolutely nothing.   So it fucked up that job so much,  that I am now on sick leave for anxiety and depression,  as my head went when my wife  threw out my baclofen and lyrica so I couldn't tailor off as I normally do.  I was seriously depressed,  and was drinking a bottle of vodka a day at work to stop the anxiety.   Wait,  thats wrong.   That was when I ran out of gbl and didnt have my lyrica to kill the gbl withdrawals.    


But at high doses,  it kills cognitive function, and if you mix in alcohol,  it cabbages you.

Did not realize there was a mega thread for this


Okay so I got prescribed Lyrica, though I don't need it. So i decided to take a recreational does of 750mg at 11:20am.. I felt the peak and the most when i was in my college classes. I was like shakey, trying to write stuff but i wrote so slow, nod out half the time. But in both classes the teacher really liked me haha, i asked a bunch of questions n what no and it was pretty fun.


The high is undescribable, i don't even know how to compare it or explain the feeling.


But to people that have taken this, how long does it last? I do feel I'm coming down and not nearly as bas as before. Its currently 7:22. Its not freakin me out its just im a bit tired of it and just want it to kinda stop and go away.


Will i be back to baseline soon? Or am I gonna feel it somewhat until i go to sleep?

I have experience Lyrica twice now. Once yesterday (300mg) and once today (450mg.)


I obtained the tablets from my girlfriends mother who has lots of back pain issues and nerve damage, but she doesn't like to take them for some reason.


The high is rather indescribable. There's a feeling of euphoria but its unlike anything else.. The loss of balance and coordination is also pretty strange. I find its very similar to GHB as the feeling is your head is kinda "tight" but "floaty." I have not had such affects as Mr. Tambourine Man has but I have had the slight dissociative feeling (only comparing to mushies / high doses of nitrous oxide.) I noticed a somewhat introspective feeling aswell, as I was walking to the park with my girlfriends niece yesterday I was thinking alot about the trees and things like that. It was very enjoyable.


I'm rather keen to keep experimenting with these capsules, but if I take 600mg tomorrow, would I get less of an affect considering I've had it for 2 days already?

I take The 50 mg Lyricas, about 3 at a time then re-dose as needed. It makes me feel pretty good. Sometimes I still feel it the next day, my body is numb, kinda like Barbs. Lyrica goes well

with Hydro also. Overall a good drug if you have nothing else.

"Pregabalin oral bioavailability is estimated to be greater than or equal to 90% and is independent of dose. The rate of pregabalin absorption is decreased when given with food resulting in a decrease in Cmax by approximately 25 to 30% and a delay in Tmax to approximately 2.5 hours. Administration with food, however, has no clinically significant effect on the extent of absorption."

According to the book Psychiatric Issues in Epilepsy: A Guide to Diagnosis and Treatment, "There are no formal cognitive studies of pregabalin using formal neuropsychological measures." (p. 86)


Also, the transcript from a presentation archived on medscape entitled "Long-term tolerability of neuropsychiatric disorders in women: Cosmetic, metabolic and cognitive adverse effects" :


> There's been concern over the last few years (and we finally started paying attention to the fact) that some of the AEDs can cause fairly significant interference with cognitive function. This sort of cropped up as we started getting a hold of these newer medicines that had actually less effect on cognitive function, and we began to notice this.
> 
> 
> 
> But in terms of thinking of the cognitive effects of these drugs, one of the things that's very important to do is to separate sedation from the cognitive effects. It's not necessarily easy, but there is a difference between medicines that make people sleepy and medicines that actually interfere with the ability to process information and to think clearly. On a simplistic level, one of the ways of thinking about it is that for many patients, hopefully most, sedation is an effect people become tolerant to over a period of time. Now, that isn't always the case, but one hopes that after a period of time, patients will be less sleepy from their medicine.
> 
> 
> 
> But even given that, some patients will continue to experience persistent disturbances with their thinking. It's also difficult to assess and to evaluate some of the literature that's out there, because measurement of cognitive effects is a very complex process. Some of the older literature that looked at this, when we've gone back and evaluated it very carefully, we realize that what was being measured was really more motor reaction speed rather than cognitive function, and we've had to rethink some of our conclusions about cognitive effects of the drugs on that basis.
> 
> 
> 
> It's also very important that when we compare these medicines, we're comparing reasonable nontoxic doses of the medicines. There was a classic case of a comparison of carbamazepine and phenytoin's cognitive effects, and it came out looking like one of the drugs was worse than the other; it turned out that with the drug that looked worse, if I remember correctly I believe it was phenytoin, actually the majority of patients who were assessed with cognitive disturbances were on higher doses with higher blood levels and actually were closer to being intoxicated on medicine. So, making sure we're comparing apples to apples is very important. Next slide, please.
> 
> 
> 
> Thinking about just sedation for a minute, this is an attempt to just try to line up our AEDs in terms of their sedative properties, and I think many people would agree with this particular categorization. I'm sure there are some people who wouldn't agree with some of the choices in terms of the pigeonholes that we've put them in, but clearly, some of our older AEDs are quite sedating -- things like phenobarbital, phenytoin, and even carbamazepine, as well as some of our newer medicines, like topiramate. And then we get down to some of our newer medicines that actually aren't very sedating at all. Again, with gabapentin, many patients do get very sedated on that initially, but there seems to be a fair amount of tolerance that develops with gabapentin. Pregabalin has probably the same sort of effect, and lamotrigine of course is not tremendously sedating at all. If we can then, we can go to the next slide.
> 
> 
> 
> Thinking about actual cognitive effects of these medicines separate as much as possible from their sedative effects, we can start thinking about a couple of things. One of them is that epilepsy itself may influence cognitive function, depending on the type of seizures a person has, or what the etiology of the seizure disorder is. For example, with traumatic brain injury or stroke, there may be effects of the underlying cause of the seizure disorder on cognitive function.
> 
> 
> 
> In terms of our AEDs, it's also kind of important to remember that these medicines exist to tone down or dampen the function of neurons and synapses, and on that basis, we need to anticipate that almost any of these medicines if they're given in high-enough doses, or in combinations, certainly can impair cognitive function. So, it's probably part of what we're working with with these medicines.
> 
> 
> 
> A great deal of attention, mentioned a few minutes ago, has been paid over the years to comparing especially the older antiepileptic drugs with each other. There's been a lot of anecdotal information and some very nicely done studies; and if we put all this together, trying to differentiate cognitive effects of things like carbamazepine and phenytoin, it's very difficult to make firm conclusions. On average, the differences between these medicines at clinically useful doses that are not toxic is probably small, on average. That doesn't mean that we don't want to pay attention to individual patients and how they respond to medicines.
> 
> 
> 
> Certainly, if we take a good hard look, the best evidence out there says that long-term effects of benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and probably topiramate, one of our newer antiepileptic drugs, the long-term effects of these drugs can be significant on cognitive function. Some of our newer AEDs have been evaluated carefully. If we can go to the next slide, please.
> 
>

> This is just a summary of a couple of studies that were done looking specifically at, in one case, a comparison of gabapentin, lamotrigine, and topiramate. This was in a small group of healthy young adults, so it certainly isn't the most definitive thing out there, but we were looking at clinically useful, clinically appropriate doses of these medicines, and when these people were compared, the cognitive effects of lamotrigine and gabapentin were certainly less than were seen with topiramate.
> 
>

> Topiramate is fairly well established in having some significant ability to interfere with cognition. And the bottom bullet on that slide is just a synopsis of a second study where gabapentin, lamotrigine, and levetiracetam were compared; in that particular study, both comparing them against carbamazepine and comparing the patients against their own baseline, all 3 of those medicines had no discernable negative cognitive impact.

Search for an article called "Lyrica and neurontin are death sentence to new synapses"

I just saw it the other day.  

This is news to me and if it is accurate it would make it a really shitty choice to help someone get through benzo withdrawals or other addictions.

^Yeah there's interesting research on how gabapentin and pregabalin prevent thrombospondin from binding to the receptors thus inhibiting new synapse formation. 


[The article](http://www.wellnessresources.com/freedom/articles/neurontin_and_lyrica_are_a_death_sentence_for_new_brain_synapses/) you mentioned is interesting but in my mind loses credibility with unsubstantiated claims such as...


> Neurontin and its newer more potent version, Lyrica, are widely used for off-label indications **that are an outright flagrant danger to the public**. These blockbuster drugs were approved for use even though the FDA had no idea what they actually did in the brain. A shocking new study shows that they block the formation of new brain synapses1, **drastically reducing the potential for rejuvenating brain plasticity – meaning that these drugs will cause brain decline faster than any substance known to mankind.**

> Synapses are asymmetric cellular adhesions that are critical for nervous system development and function, but the mechanisms that induce their formation are not well understood. We have previously identified thrombospondin as an astrocyte-secreted protein that promotes central nervous system (CNS) synaptogenesis. Here, we identify the neuronal thrombospondin receptor involved in CNS synapse formation as alpha2delta-1, the receptor for the anti-epileptic and analgesic drug gabapentin. We show that the VWF-A domain of alpha2delta-1 interacts with the epidermal growth factor-like repeats common to all thrombospondins. alpha2delta-1 overexpression increases synaptogenesis in vitro and in vivo and is required postsynaptically for thrombospondin- and astrocyte-induced synapse formation in vitro. Gabapentin antagonizes thrombospondin binding to alpha2delta-1 and powerfully inhibits excitatory synapse formation in vitro and in vivo. These findings identify alpha2delta-1 as a receptor involved in excitatory synapse formation and suggest that gabapentin may function therapeutically by blocking new synapse formation.

And here is the accompanying press release from the researchers (provided on the same site as and in contradiction to the above article)... its long so I put it in NSFW tags. Its very SFW. 


**NSFW**: 


Researchers at the Stanford University School of Medicine have identified a key molecular player in guiding the formation of synapses — the all-important connections between nerve cells — in the brain. This discovery, based on experiments in cell culture and in mice, could advance scientists’ understanding of how young children’s brains develop as well as point to new approaches toward countering brain disorders in adults.


The new work also pinpoints, for the first time, the biochemical mechanism by which the widely prescribed drug gabapentin (also marketed under the trade name Neurontin) works. “We have solved the longstanding mystery of how this blockbuster drug acts,” said Ben Barres, MD, PhD, professor and chair of neurobiology. The study shows that gabapentin halts the formation of new synapses, possibly explaining its therapeutic value in mitigating epileptic seizures and chronic pain. This insight, however, may lead physicians to reconsider the circumstances in which the drug should be prescribed to pregnant women.


The paper, to be published online Oct. 8 in the journal Cell, looks at the interaction between neurons — the extensively researched nerve cells that account for 10 percent of the cells in the brain — and the less-studied but much more common brain cells called astrocytes. Much work has been done on how neurons transmit electrical signals to each other through synapses — the nanoscale electrochemical contact points between neurons. It is the brain’s circuitry of some 100 trillion of these synapses that allow us to think, feel, remember and move.


It is commonly agreed that the precise placement and strength of each person’s trillions of synaptic connections closely maps with that person’s cognitive, emotional and behavioral makeup. But exactly why a particular synapse is formed in a certain place at a certain time has largely remained a mystery. In 2005, Barres took a big step toward explaining this process when he and his colleagues discovered that a protein astrocytes secrete, called thrombospondin, is essential to the formation of this complex brain circuitry.


Still, no one knew the precise mechanism by which thrombospondin induced synapse formation.


In this new study, Barres, lead author Cagla Eroglu, PhD, and their colleagues demonstrate how thrombospondin binds to a receptor found on neurons’ outer membranes. The role of this receptor, known as alpha2delta-1, had been obscure until now. But in an experiment with mice, the scientists found that neurons lacking alpha2delta-1 were unable to form synapses in response to thrombospondin stimulation.


And when the researchers grew neurons in a dish that were bioengineered to overexpress this receptor, those neurons produced twice as many synapses in response to stimulation with thrombospondin than did their ummodified counterparts.


The new discovery about alpha2delta-1’s key role in synapse formation carries important implications for understanding the cause of pain and of epilepsy and developing improved medications for these conditions.


It was already known that alpha2delta-1 is the neuronal receptor for gabapentin, one of the world’s most widely administered medications. Gabapentin is often prescribed for epilepsy and chronic pain, and its off-label use for other indications is widespread. Up to now, the molecular mechanism of gabapentin’s action — what, exactly, it’s doing to counter seizures or chronic pain — was unknown. But both syndromes may involve excessive numbers of synaptic connections in local areas of the brain.


In their new study, Barres and his colleagues found that when gabapentin was administered in developing mice, it bound to alpha2delta-1, preventing thrombospondin from binding to the receptor and, in turn, impeding synapse formation. Likewise, by blocking thrombosponin, gabapentin may reduce excess synapse formation in vulnerable areas of the human brain.


Barres noted that he and his colleagues found that gabapentin does not dissolve pre-existing synapses, but only prevents formation of new ones. That greatly diminishes gabapentin’s potential danger to adults. In mature human brains, astrocytes ordinarily produce very little thrombospondin, and adult neurons don’t form many new synapses, although some new synapses do continue to be formed throughout life — for example, in a part of the brain where new memories are laid down and at sites of injury to neurons, such as occurs after a stroke.


But the new findings raise questions about gabapentin’s effect in situations where synapse formation is widespread and crucial, most notably in pregnancies. The vast bulk of the brain’s synapses are formed during gestation and the very early months and years after birth. Because gabapentin easily crosses the placental barrier, it could potentially interfere with a fetus’ rapidly developing brain just when global synapse formation is proceeding at breakneck speed.


“It’s a bit scary that a drug that can so powerfully block synapse formation is being used in pregnant women,” Barres said. “This potential effect on fetal brains needs to be taken seriously. Right now, doctors have the view that gabapentin is the safest anticonvulsant. There is no question that pregnant women with epilepsy who have been advised by their neurologists to continue their anticonvulsant treatment with gabapentin during their pregnancy should definitely remain on this drug until instructed otherwise. But there is no long-term registry being kept to track gabapentin-exposed babies. Our findings are saying that we need to be following up on these newborns so that their cognitive performance can be studied as they grow older.”

Hmmm, so if it blocks excitability synapses and over expressed ones then it sounds like a good thing for those seeking neurontin type benefits and maybe underlies it's less addictive characteristics.

Thanks for showing the source study!

I've always been a bit concerned about what it is that makes pregabalin compromising to male fertility, and whether or not it was reversible. From the same datasheet cited a few posts above (and also, below), I found this information, which I found, as a human male, rather comforting:

For instance, in this context, define "health"? Is that the velocity with which it conducts its signal? is it the strength of axonal growth, re/generative abilities, or myelin integrity that determines the "health" of a nerve cell?

"New synapses" could only form when a brand new nerve cell generates amongst the cluster of older ones, as a 'synapse' is the space between two separate nerve cells. And new nerve cells in adult brains don't occur very often - the most current research restricts neuronal growth in adult brains to very localized regions of the prefrontal cortex, which means that the researchers the article's author attempts to discredit *are* right. If new synapses form only when new nerve cells appear - an uncommon, unpredictable occurrence - then adult neurons certainly don't form many new synapses.

Also, Cane, bravo for posting that abstract and PR. Just reading the press release re-taught me a whole shitload about synaptogenesis (been a few years since college and clinical neuropsychology lol); I especially liked this part:


"Barres noted that he and his colleagues found that gabapentin does not dissolve pre-existing synapses, but only prevents formation of new ones. That greatly diminishes gabapentin’s potential danger to adults. In mature human brains, astrocytes ordinarily produce very little thrombospondin, and adult neurons don’t form many new synapses, although some new synapses do continue to be formed throughout life — for example, in a part of the brain where new memories are laid down and at sites of injury to neurons, such as occurs after a stroke."


I wonder if this paragraph provides implications for the idea that chronic use of either gabapentin or pregabalin may permanently impair memory encoding in adults when a multiple-year model of study would be used. I'm 25, and it's difficult to gage where an adolescent brain becomes an 'adult' brain - thus signaling the end of major new synaptogenesis and tissue plasticity in the brain. The short-term deficits in memory that I, and almost every other lyrica user here, have complained about must be caused by a2-d1 activation, but at the same time, it isn't the synapses that are being affected. Or maybe they are, in another in/direct manner. I dislike being the guinea pig, but nevertheless, THANK YOU for the wonderful abstract and press release!!!!

I discovered that Cane's nice article is available as free text, and really worth reading (if you're a neuroscience/neuropsychology freak like I am) and is available with the [click](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2791798/) of your mouse.


Credit goes to Cane for finding it in the first place, though. I wouldn't have known where to begin looking for such an article :D

i tried Lyrica for the first time today.  early this morning, i was coming down from a moderate D-AMP binge and trying to decide if i should dose more Dex or try to go to sleep.  i had some Lyrica sitting around but had no idea what it was and what it did.  eventually read a post saying it worked well for stimulant comedowns.  decided to take 150mg. instead of more Amps.  i was amazed at how incredibly well it worked.  easily the best substance for dealing with such.  kills Clonidine.  kills opie's.  kills benzos.  it's a dream come true.

^ good to hear.

it also provides a high to most people who seek it, it is addicting and w/d's from it are horrible and dangerous (kinda like benzos) so now that you have discovered this med i would save it for exactly what you used it for, stim come downs.. you don't wanna abuse it and become dependant.

just lookin out for your best interest.

I tried lyrica at diff points on diff doses with mixed results. Sometimes didn't have an empty stomach. Experienced mostly nothing besides a hazy stupor 12hrs later when I woke up. Till I discovered the right dose and to dose on an empty stomach. I then went on a lil binge. N tolerance rose high that week. It's a hard high to bump after the first initial 4-7hrs. N 2 days in a row is very hit or miss. To get good results 4 the day after required empty stomach and an increase in dosing from 7-800mg to 1g or more. After a wk or 2 I blew threw 60 pills and tolerance and rebound anxiety AND insomnia. So watch out crew!

Right, well it's been a good 6 weeks since my last post and thought I would update on how I'm getting on this drug. I'm taking it under the directions of my GP; to be used in conjunction with CBT (Cognitive Behavioural Therapy). I originally started on 75mg a day and have rapidly developed a tolerance and am now taking 400mg daily.


I'm not sure how high I will go in dose but my doc seems to be very happy throwing them at me. My mood has stabilised and I feel a lot happier so they must be doing something right.


As for effects on higher than usual doses, I must report that one night I took around 700mg to try and get a bit high and at first I didn't notice anything. I sat there watching a film and suddenely when I stood up I realised I was feeling incredibly euphoric, and I mean seriously euphoric, up there with MDMA and Psilocybin but in a different way that's hard to explain, less of a head fuck and more of a pure body buzz. It was really exciting and highly enjoyable, obviously LOL. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png) I wish I could get that feeling from it all the time, I'm not sure what I done different as I took that amount before and never got euphoria like that. 


So yeah, I just wanted to confirm that the people in this thread who said they experience intense euphria weren't embelishing the truth. You can get pretty high of this stuff!


I just hope my brain doesn't rot if I end up on this for 6 months or so, and I also hope I don't get any w/d symptoms, I'll keep you updated guys. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

^Hey man it sounds like we are in similar positions. Bi-polar perhaps? Regardless watch out because tolerance grows FAST (at least for me) because I could take a whole  script of it stupid fast and not have any withdrawal, no negatives, except for some twitching on early high doses but it wasn't that bad.


It feels like I'm rolling on in now and I popped 2000mg on a full stomach. I've taken more than that but get best effects around 1400mg. I'm just stupid and can't get over the "more pills are more fun" mentality. 


Just watch out and be careful because some people talk about bad wd's and if you are trying to be stable and are doing CBT your goal should not include getting high. You will probably have best results if taken as directed honestly.

So I don't post much here, more of an observer.


But Lyrica is very safe at high doses IMO.


2PM - Took 6 x 100mg tabs - felt an okay rush

4pm- Took 6 more tabs 

6pm - Getting ready for an hour & 1/2 drive, I popped in 800mg

*felt good* not great but good

12:30am - Taking 1g as I  type this


I've taken these practically since they came out. My ex-girlfriend got them for nerve damage.  I miss the 300mg's x 3 per day. 100mg x 3 per day.


So I don't do them daily. But today is day number 2 since I got the  bottle.


I find you develop a tolerance VERY quickly to this.


I am considering downing the entire bottle as a test to see how safe they are.


I have about 40-50 pills left.


Hah, but no it would be a waste. Taking 1g... wishing I had an IV.


*Peace from*

You serious about downing a whole bottle? That could be fatal please don't do!


@ luxurious beagle:


Nah, I'm not Bi-Polar, I think I suffer from ADHD tbh and a chemical imbalance which I think is a lack of Dopamine. I've been taking L-Tyrosine supplements (500mg) and Pregabalin now for a 7-8 weeks odd and I feel much better, no social hang ups like I had before it really is a drug that works for me on doses of 400mg per day. 


The only thing is I just feel a bit....dense on it. It's like you can feel it eating away at your IQ, maybe that's just me being a little scared after reading some of the comments on here saying it will cause brain damage and that it inhibits certain neurotransmitters vital to learning etc. 


I hope I'll be ok because this drug makes me feel good, and I don't have to resort to evil benzo's which don't allow you to enjoy life same way. 


Be safe peeps. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I have fibromyalgia and was prescribed Lyrica back in August. I was supposed to take one 75mg capsule per day. I feel it is far from recreational for me. Instead of putting my mind at ease and in a gentle hypnotic state like I've heard from so many people here, instead it made me *really* anxious and confused. I thought oncoming traffic was driving head on towards me in my lane while driving. It definitely made me feel dumb as hell too - something I hate. I just don't like not being able to articulate my thoughts. It's sad though really, because it gives me so much relief from my neck, shoulder and lower back pain from FMS. I'm going to try to take it again because I've been hurting real bad the past week.


Anyone else had this kind of experience with Lyrica? Specifically the anxiety? It seems odd that a drug like this that is approved for treatment of GAD would cause intense anxiety. Maybe it's just me.

Yeah I can relate to that. When I first started taking Pregabalin at 75mg I got anxious/confused feeling. Eventually those feelings stopped, you need to give it a bit of a chance for your body to get used to it so you can move up to the high doses as I think that is where this drugs starts coming into it's own. 


Remember, I suffer from anxiety on a daily basis and I am totally familiar with the feelings you describe, but this drug has really helped me. When I was first taking 75mg it felt quite strong to me and I wondered how other people here at Bluelight were taking does in the 400/600mg range (let alone 1 gram and beyond, lol you nutters). But I am taking those doses and beyond now  and I do not get anxious, it removes my anxiety. I think you need to just ride it through, it's like quite a lot of drugs actually, Tramadol being a good example, it's shit when you first take it, cause dyspohria, anxiety etc etc but when you ride through that from taking it regularly all these symptoms disappear and the real benefits of the drug start to show their face.

Regarding anxiety, lyrica is amazing for me. It makes me happy and removes anxiety. I was diagnosed with GAD four years back, and have been taking lyrica for a couple years sporadically. Just like a poster above mine is prescribed to my girlfriend who rarely uses it for her back injury. She mostly uses her methadone and percoset and gives the lyrica to me. I usually finish a bottle of 120 100mg in a week. 


The first day I take 1400 mg and feel fantastic for two days. The next time I take it I take like 2g and feel good. Then I just finish the bottle over time popping here and there, being stupid knowing its not really gonna help. Then once a few months ago I didnt have any for a month and got 500mg and it really helped in a number of ways and I had a pretty good high actually. 


I've thought about just popping the bottle too just to see what happens, but then I though hmm that's either a)going to do nothing b)really fuck me up (likely to fuck me up in a bad way like with motor control or stupidity factor) or c) kill me


So yea you can take a ton of lyrica and not have any/many problems. But keep in mind my gf started getting them two years ago so I have been taking them for a while. I have never had wds from it. I started taking 75 mg and then 150mg which totally messed me up in a great way. Then I went to 300 and it made me feel crappy. Then I went to 650 and felt great. The rest is history.


For people not liking lyrica: lyrica is all about getting the dose right. It varies greatly depending on how long you've taken it, how recently you've taken it, and what your body is like.


And finally regarding feeling stupid and lyrica preventing neurons from forming: early on I felt stupid on it - I couldn't even speak properly - I would try to say something like "I saw a screwdriver on the bench" and I'll say "I saw a spoon on the form" Like it's not even screwing the word up it's changing it entirely and seemingly at random. That happens very infrequently though. And sometimes I actually feel smarter or more sharp on it. I was learning sign language with my girl and we were practicing and reviewing for her test. I literally learned everything she had learned in the past month in a night. My reading outloud with spot on and quick, regardless of the sentence length/structure or word difficulty. But really with everything it comes down to dose and how long you've tried it.


To ThePharmacist: Do you just take 75mg a day or is it PO BID or what? If it is only 75mg a day and it is helping your pain but messing up your mind, then I would suggest opening the capsule and dumping out the powder and then dividing it into three even piles. Try taking one or two of the piles at a time and see if that helps your pain without messing up your mind. You may just be hypersensitive to it. Let me know how long you've been on it and what exactly you take during the day and maybe I can help you. Good luck!

Do doctors actually prescribe this for anxiety and stuff or does everyone who uses it for that get it from someone with nerve pain?

I have seen it available in Europe for anxiety but not here, it it just a money thing with the pharmaceutical companies? Like they are afraid to lose money or something? It seems well established that it works for GAD based on it's success over seas

I don't take it that often, only when my pain is really bad. I've had a whole bottle of it since August. I took it for 4 days straight as prescribed - 75mg once daily. It seemed like I would be okay for about 3-hours then the confusion and anxiety would set in, as well as the social awkwardness. I just decided it wasn't worth it due to the adverse effects. Since my pain has been really bad lately I'm thinking of taking it again. Right now I'm prescribed Neurontin 300mg x3 daily and that isn't really doing shit. Perhaps now that I have a tolerance to Neurontin, the Lyrica may work better for me. Maybe I'll try taking a small dose today and report back.

So, I took regular dose of neurontin today (900mg). Before hopping in bed I took 75mg of Lyrica. It made me feel pretty good, so I took another 75mg capsule. Very hypnotic, no anxiety, I feel sloppy and tired. However my pain is gone and I don't feel any anxiety. I think my tolerance to neurontin has helped with the adverse effects I experienced before from Lyrica.

I guess you were just very sensitive to it. I'm glad it's working for you, but if you need it for pain use it only when you NEED to. Otherwise your tolerance will skyrocket and the pain will reappear and you will NEED it and have nothing to help (or you will get something else to help and repeat the aformentioned process). Good luck and when you feel relief or feel good don't (don't don't don't) up the dose.


Oh and also your anxiety may have been caused by you being around people feeling 'sloppy.' And now you tried it in a comfortable environment and you aren't worried about what others may think or see. Just a thought.

I am using it in combination with my oxycontin. I take Lyrica 600mg for three days, oxycontin for 3 days and then back to the Lyrica. It really works for my back pain, not as good as the oxy but it does work and using it will keep me from using the oxy a lot. I don't really run a risk of addiction since I can go cold turkey from oxy for weeks and not feel any withdrawl after years of using it, but the less I ask my doctor for oxy the easier my life is. Getting opiates out of him is like pulling teeth.

Wait, lyrica can only be absorbed 300mg at a time?  I thought this was only gabapentin wtf.  I thought 600mg dose at once was pretty good.. I take 1800mg of neurontin every other day (6 doses 1 hour apart) and 1 mg of klonopin the days I don't take gaba and now I got a script for lyrica.


thanks.

enjoy it while it lasts.  stuff was the best thing that ever happened to me and then it just made me feel worse.  so incredibly saddening.  not to mention MAMMOTH weight gain and extreme reduction in cognition and even motor skills.  i just had to stop taking it.  but once in a while i would take 1gram at night and feel so good the next day; social, productive, just like adderall, xanax, and prozac in one.  man i miss the shit out of the lyrica daze........now its klonopin and redbull.  not the same, not the same at all.  however, im not talking to myself all the time and getting flustered easily....but that motivation and wanting to talk....man i miss it.  my girl does too.

Ok, so im looking to try some of this for the first time maybe today or in a couple of days. I was wondering what the best starting dose (for recreational use) would be. I am experienced with a few benzo's + opiates and use to abuse Trammadol quite a lot. I have also done GBL almost everyday for the past 8months and on and off for a year before that, will this affect dosage at all? I would like to get "High!" but am not sure if i will have a big supply of this. I would consider "High!" to be slumped up against a wall on the floor laughing my ass off and drooling! 


Oh yeah and what are the top 3 most efficient ROA's? Would it be possible to dissolve this in water and drink it for a faster come up?


Thanks.

Right. So i decided to take some Lyrica 50mg's roughly based on some reports i read. I took 450mg's in total and snorted 2 of the pills, the effects were weak by my standards of trying to get high, and i was quite dissapointed, i ended up buying some beers as i read a few cans can really potentiate the effects, it didnt do too much but it was quite ok after 4 cans. im looking to take some by either bombing them in a rizzla or dissolving them in water next time, however i do not have high hopes anymore. (someone reply!!)

There's no reason to snort Lyrica, the oral BA is almost 100%.

all I can offer you is my personal experience man, but lemme say this - for better or for worse (and its sheer strength can sometimes be overwhelming!), when I smoke herb after my lyrica has kicked in, depending on the dose of lyrica I feel exactly like I'm candyflipping and the E just peaked. My friend and I went to grab a case of beer. He left the freezer locker without my noticing, and I literally began to believe that I was lost on the moon. All of a sudden, iwas at the desk with my friend holding out my credit card to the cashier. Really unexpected, far out experience. If you're intending to experience it, I'll admit it can be really incredible, novel and, at times, supernatural. Just don't overdo it like I apparently did unintentionally.

while I wouldn't say cadyflipping peak it is a verrry interesting experience.  a half a dozen times I have had out-of-body type experiences on neurontin or lyrica...especially with a well timed bowl/klonopin and valerian  I think it feels a lot like a decent opiate  too for that hour-2 that can be amazing.  like maybe not IV hydromorphone but something good.  and of course sometimes if feels lime AMP without bad side effects (also can make me last for an hour like AMP).  oh and usually all in the same "session"  lol, cool drugs IMO.


anyway I just got prescibed lyrica as well so I'm going to try taking 400mg x6 neurontin doses then take my normal 600mg lyrica dose at the end.  as usual 48 hours since I last had either.  oh also 1-2mg of kpin (48 hours since but had 3mg) and my daily 150mg of bupropion.  OH, BTW.  I am finally not depressed, don't have sleeping problems, quit smoking and am making great choices in my life.


finally one of these weird drugs that is tolerated by my doctors and really helps me function and keeps me from illegal drugs.  took 10 years.  would like to get off the kpin though.

I wrote this last year, over in TDS.


[Opiate WD treatment and cure with Lyrica](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/showthread.php?t=514430)


Two months after quitting all opiates entirely, I tapered off Lyrica over 10 days.  I felt a little run down for a day or two, but that's the extent of any Lyrica WD I felt.  

Since then, I've had no "PAWS", and have experienced absolutely no desire or cravings for either opiates or Lyrica since.

I don't know if its directly related, but even the thought of doing opiates makes my stomach involuntarily turn, and my head reels from remembering the feeling of junk sickness with almost total recall.  It's like the ultimate aversion therapy.

The only problem I've found with Lyrica , is that it makes my eyelids swell, and makes my eyes blood shot - that is in doses of 600mg upwardsl. Below, that, I don't have the same problem.  It also, at these doses, really affects my eyesight in a negative way.


Glad to hear it worked for opiate withdrawal.  I've found it useful in getting of lengthy booze binges too.

I took 700mg pregablin this morning and so far i started to feel really chilled, and still do, but ive started getting ALOT of involentry muscle movements, my legs are twitching everywhere and i can feel my muscles contracting (mainly in my legs), im a bit worried im gonna seizure.


I really like the drunken off balance and chilled out mild europhia, but the twitching/muscle movements make me really paranoid, are these common on lyrica, should i stop worrying im goong to seizure? Thamls

it gradually stopped, when i take lower doses like 300mg or so for anxiety etc, no twitching, only high dose, anyone know why? 


done 300mg today, then redosed another 300mg later and no twitching, its great for anxiety.


But high doses i was twtiching and spazzing out everywhere was horrible.

I had 2400mg the other night before bedtime, and had amazing dreams, but was a bit twitchy and anxious the next morning.   I've been taking 1000mg every twelve hours since, and have had boundless energ, but yet can sleep without any problem.


The downside is that I find that after a couple of days the dose tolerance goes very high.  Not sure why this is.   I'll try the lower dose of 300 to see if that helps for the anxiety.   I've always been so anxious, I take the full prescribed 600mg per day for anxiety twice a day!, and dose around another 600 during the day, at regular intervals.     A the the end of the day,  my memory is shot and I find it difficult to walk - a bit like my legs are prosthetics rather than my own limbs!

ps - I never get twitching on pregabalin, but I get regular myoclonic jerks on baclofen, which are VERY noticeable.   I drop cups of tea, coffee, coke etc. I now have to make a conscious effort if I have to hold something and do it with both hands.

I took 450mg's in total and snorted 2 of the pills, the effects were weak by my standards of trying to get high, and i was quite dissapointed, i ended up buying some beers as i read a few cans can really potentiate the effects, it didnt do too much but it was quite ok after 4 cans. im looking to take some by either bombing them in a rizzla or dissolving them in water next time, however i do not have high hopes anymore. (someone reply!!)

Aight man think a minute:D Bomb in rizzla? Its capsules so it basically on "Bomb" already. Also to get a good high do 800mg and wait up to 2 hours before you increase the dose. The drug need about 40houers to clear the system I recommend 2 days between high's :D.


 Don't get addicted like me, tolerance goes up fast and keep adding 1x300mg capsule a day I ended up with 1500mg dose twice a day. The withdraw on this stuff is awful ended up with going 3 days with no sleep and only 1 meal before I budged and took 600mg.

finally got prescribed lyrica i have been on it since friday , but i didnt take it today and felt anxious all day and like shit....i first got my script on friday evening around 4pm.. popped  100mgs along with 2mgs klonopin,  30mg roxicodone, and 32.5mg of hydrocodone, smoked around a gram of weed and went to a party....felt amazing, talkative, and sociable..the next day (saturday) i took 3mgs klonopin, 100mg lyrica at 11am, and smoked weed all day, and at around 7pm i had 2 beers and i got really fucked up...nodding harddd...sunday i had to work but dosed 100mg lyrica and 100mg tramadol...dont really remember that day...monday morning i took 100mg lyrica and it was an excellent anxiolytic throughout the whole day giving me a strong urge to just run my mouth lmfao and i have SAD so just interacting with people brought on a good euphoria..around 4pm i had .25mg klonopin, another 50mg of lyrica, smoked a couple bongs, and had 4 beers and i felt amazingg....great anxiolytic, even better for SAD than klonopin for me in my case which brings more euphoria but more sedation to the point i go into zombie mode, but lyrica allows me to be extroverted while bringing on a carefree attitude and people around me noticed..it was fucking awsome....this shit is like a miracle drug for me, not so much because of the high (even though it was excellent with klonopin, and oxy), but more for the anxiolytic purposes

no, lyrica is often prescribed in conjunction with other seizure meds, and thus increases their efficiency at preventing seizures. in addition, lyrica increases sedation and possibly euphoria felt by the user.  


"*Pharmacodynamics

Like gabapentin, pregabalin binds to the α2δ (alpha2delta) subunit of the voltage-dependent calcium channel in the central nervous system. Pregabalin decreases the release of neurotransmitters such as glutamate, noradrenaline, and substance P (Australian Medicines Handbook). Pregabalin increases neuronal GABA levels by producing a dose-dependent increase in glutamic acid decarboxylase activity.[1] **Glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) is the enzyme that converts the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate into the inhibitory GABA in a single step. For this reason, pregabalin greatly potentiates benzodiazepines, barbiturates & other depressants**.*"


source: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregabalin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregabalin)


...would be interesting to see some data if lyrica disrupts visuals, which is comparable to how benzos almost stop a trip, however i am not certain...

My friend and I went to grab a case of beer. He left the freezer locker without my noticing, and I literally began to believe that I was lost on the moon. All of a sudden, iwas at the desk with my friend holding out my credit card to the cashier. Really unexpected, far out experience. If you're intending to experience it, I'll admit it can be really incredible, novel and, at times, supernatural. Just don't overdo it like I apparently did unintentionally.

That has been my experience with Lyrica as well, especially in high doses, i.e. 1g-ish.


Anyhow, your post reminded me of this one time back in late '05 when I had a friend take me to Hastings after I had consumed around 100-150mg MDMA and 3 hits of LSD. I wanted to get The Mars Volta's "Scabdates". Anyhow, when we got there I was trying to find the CD but every single row of CDs looked exactly the same, I couldn't find the CD and every single CD cover looked the same to me. I ended up standing in one of the rows looking slowly up and down from the ceiling to the floor because rainbow liquids were dripping down from the ceiling and hitting the floor, causing kaleidoscopic explosions on the floor. Everything was warping so badly I could not barely see and I was not suitable to be in public at all. I got to the counter to buy the CD with the guidance of my friend and when they told me the $ total, I could not understand the concept of different amounts of money. I pulled all of the money out of my wallet and just started throwing it down on the counter. At this point my friend took over and payed for it.

I can only imagine how I looked to everyone else in line.

> I would say 300mg would be a good starting dose for someone not tolerant to GABAergics. Also, this isn't an anti-depressant, you don't need to wait a long period of time to feel its effects. We're talking about recreational drugs, lyrica takes a long time to kick in and that is 1-1.5hours oral. I have a mild GABA tolerance and find 900-1200mg a good dose but have taken 2400mg before and had fun so I wouldn't say you are at risk of ODing and having a bad time. In any case you sound like you would really benefit from some drug/lyrica education so read the lyrica/pregabalin megathread and whatever you can on here. The only real negative side effect I have experienced when you are at the 1000mg plus range is joint pain.

> 
> I would think 450 would be recreational for someone like you with 300 being conservative but hey if 300 or 225 (I gather you have 75mg tabs) even works for you then great. The problem with starting low is that the half life is 5-6 hours and it takes a while to kick in so by the time you wait and don't feel much then wait for it to kick in your system has eliminated a decent amount, so start somewhere reasonable. Definitely don't start below 200 and feel free to go up to 600.

Eh, I'm kinda doubtful of that, just based on extensive experience with conventional clubbing drugs and with pregabalin. I think the disorientation factor would hinder being able to fully let loose in public, but it depends on the dosage. If something like 300mg works for you (recreationally), then, perhaps; but the ataxic side effect only increases with an increase in dosage, and I wouldn't imagine that for someone without a tolerance it would be very safe. And for someone WITH a tolerance, it probably wouldn't be all that euphoric. YMMV though ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

I've heard of lyrica being compared to MDMA on more than one occasion. I, however, have never tried MDMA yet so can't say myself.

Well, once again, pregabalin is only stimulating in high doses. In my drug using days, I wanted to try MDMA with around a 1 gram of pregabalin. I can only imagine! With little to no tolerance 1 gram has gotten me to where a decent dose of MDMA would. I've never been much of a fan of MDMA (MDA is another story), but I would imagine that combo would bring back some of the magic!

Yeah, I compose music on it, play guitar on it, everything. Of course, I'm prescribed the shit and never feel anything from it, but it still does everything it's supposed to do, and probably more.

Im prescribed 600mg of gabapentin  3x a day, for undiagnosed back pain. I did get a high from it. Makes me pass out tho so i only take it when im in pain. It worked so he gave me samples of lyrica, at first everything was fine but after awhile I did get the "suicidal thoughts" (they talk about as a side effect). Im back on the Gab, but it doesnt seem to help anymore. Could I have built up a tolerance even tho I only take it once in a while?

anyone ever combine good quality cocaine with lyrica?   I have a bunch of 50mg tabs and I can't drink alcohol due to having lyme disease and subsequently, tons of allergies.  I don't wanna take too much lyrica and have that dull headed feeling.


any recommendations on dosages?  I've been trying to stay away from phenibut and benzos the last couple of weeks and lyrica seems like a good substitute.

Yes, coke is good on Lyrica; however, it doesn't really alleviate the suicidal comedown. Better get some Xanax and OxyContin.

"No doubt I am dependent on it. But the pros far outweigh the cons with this drug if you have the combo of migraines, fibromyalgia, and severe anxiety."


i got a lyrica scrip  for my chronic pain back in dec 2009


I used it for about a year 4x150 mg a day the first 3 months, to eventually 50 mg a day in the last month.


I also found the wonders that this drug gave me.

next to helping with my pain it gave me a nice buzz , motivation and help me with my sleep.

Life never seemed better.


this changed.

I had to aks my docotor to quit eventually because this shit fucked my brains up baaaaaad.


in the last months of using i couldn't remember things i yust done a few seconds ago,  , getting weird thoughts , mistaking people for others , forgetting names , mayor confusion in general.


2 months after quitting my memory is still recovering.


Be warned even though this drug seems like the wonderpill it has some destructive plans for your brain in the long run.


Dont become a every day user if you dont have to.

This drug will make you dumb in a bad way.

Unfortunately, I'm all too aware of those effects. I've been on it since '08, with a couple little breaks in between then and now. The whole not remembering things I just did, names, people, etc. is just not that big of a deal to me. I'm used to it. I'm an 8-year Xanax/Klonopin addict, with 4 months clean from that shit now. So I'm used to my memory being a complete and total trainwreck. The effect that Lyrica has on my memory isn't as bad as being barred-out, it's just 'different'. Still not good. But the therapeutic benefits of the stuff outweigh the memory issues. It doesn't make me dumb...I would say that "spacey" is more the right term.

It doesn't work recreationally when taken daily. Allow for at least 1-2 days in between. Best taken once a week for recreational value. And I personally need around 1000 mg to feel it.

here in the uk its approved for GAD since 2007, but im not 100% sure all doctors know about it, ive tried anti depressents and they just make me feel horrific, my gp tapered me off benzos so knows my drug history, but she is very understanding and helpful, doesnt seem to look down on me at all.


Is it worth a try to ask to try lyrica, even small doses at least, as far as docs are concerned its not recreational and has a very low abuse potential. 


Ive seen private psychs/therapists none of it has helped, i just need something to make me feel normal ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)

i got a lyrica script a week or two ago and i was having a slight allergic reaction.  Just a terrible headache but an allergic reaction nonetheless.   My doctor just gave me gabapentin.  I had a 50mg dose of lyrica versus a 300mg dose of gabapentin now.   I find the gabapentin the most euphoric.  It feels way better than lyrica to me.


On gabapentin I feel great and I can't stop smiling and I am very content.  On lyrica I feel slow and uncoordinated and a little numb but none of the positive emotional effects.


Anyone else experience anything similar?

You should try some reliable IOPs instead off buying off the streets. Sounds too risky for me going to grab some benzos from a drug dealer in sense of harm reduction both legally and when concerning about health issues. I bet it is even cheaper that way and sometimes might be even cheaper than getting a legit script and buying from a pharmacy if you dont have health insurance.


Depends on the Dr if you get a script by asking for a specified drug and also the way asking it.


If you are asking by saying that friend gave some and it worked really nice and gave me even a buzz you would not your script.


I am quite capable of describing how I feel to my psychiatrist and also I ask for medication by saying that as I have read from scientific studies that it might work well for that and does not interfere my other medications when I looked it up from Medscapes and also according to a how it pharmacologically works and by the way it is supposed to be less addicting and have less side effect than drug X.


But that only works if you do your background studies before going to a Dr and have a basic understanding of pharmaceutics and general medicine and dont mess up with the terms when speaking to Dr.


If that sounds too complicated you could try checking the indications that the drug is used for primarily and then do some googling what symptoms those indications have and then pick one of them and describe those symptoms to the Dr. Dont pick one that has to be tested for example by bloodworks or mri, or some invasive procedures like colonoscopy for example ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Today I heard about a bunch of people injecting Pregabalin.


My questions are - 


Is there a recreational value from Lyrica IV ?

And what are the effects like when IVed ?


Thanks!

Think with your own mind. Shooting of 300mg to few grams of anything solid in to your bloodstream would appear to be stupid when you really understand how your veins and metabolism works.

The bioavailability of oral pregabalin is 90% or more depending of person. It is rapidly absorbed when taken orally. The euphoria or whatever you want to call the feeling of being intoxicated by pregabalin is mostly caused because that it promotes creation of GAD aka glutamic acid decarboxylate which is a enzyme that converts glutamate into GABA. Therefore there are no rush effects or instantenous high as it takes the same time for the enzyme being first created and then the enzyme needs to convert glutamate into GABA when insufflated, taken orally or injected to your vein or drilling a hole in your head and inserting a capsule into it.


Secondary effects of pregabalin is that it decreases the release of neurotransmitters which neither does not give any high feeling.


So there is no point in IV use except if you are addicted to injecting solid substances to your veins.

Thank you for your reply. I agree with you on everything you write. I have no plans on exploring this myself, I don't even like **Pregabalin** in a recreational sence.

I am only curious about it when taken intravenous since apparently some people do. But then again people inject water just because of the "needle fixation" so you never know. And people are just strange.

But nevertheless I have a big juicy neverending interest in medication/pharmaceuticals/narcotics and their effect on the body and mind and the different routes getting the stuff into your body.


Anyway if Anybody else has some experience in IV Pregabalin(Lyrica) maybe you have tried it or know someone who has - please write!

I know a person who did once IV pregabalin even though I told him not to do it as it has no sense but that person is a type who injects everything you can get from pharmacy or from a dealer as she wants to experience everything by himself before believing anything. She uses pregabalin for to potentiate oxycodone/midazolam combo she does.


The reply was that she felt less rush/high as she dosed them at same time all as she did not believe that the need for taking pregabalin an hour before taking the drug(s) you are trying to potentiate is because it does need some time after absorbed to be effective in potentiating benzos/opiates instead of that it takes an hour to absorb.


So even if there is a non intelligent reason to IV pregabalin it should be done about 45 minutes before taking the drug you are going to potentiate. The 15 minute difference in timing when compared is just because that my and my psychiatrist's hypothesis is that pregabalin absorbs within 15 minutes taken orally.

i stopped taking lyrica due to weight gain, it making me feel agitated, jumbled, and easily overwhelmed.  however i was SO productive on it. the motivation was there and i would run around getting so much accomplished. i still do but its harder.  this is after the first 3 months which were WONDERFUL. a cross between a benzo without the shitty side effects, adderall without the side effects, and an SSRI without the side effects. it has been several months now that i stopped and i am going to try to go back on. i just wonder if it will work again.  the last times i took it all i could do was use it for recreational purposes.  though i did find if i took a large dose before sleep the next day i could feel some of the desired effects i remembered from the first 3 months. what a strange and wonderful drug.  its just that even after weeks of stopping it did not work like it used to. i will see if it works again.


DO NOT IV it. it has talc in it and will not provide a rush.  there is debate that it is metabolized in the gut and so oral is probably best.  IME IV gave a few mins of feeling a little buzzed but oral really gave hours and hours of desired effects that were STRONGER than IV.

Are UK docs now more clued up that lyrica has been approved for the treatment off General anxiety disorder yet, or will i have to bring in some medical notes printed off or something?


its my last chance at trying a med for anxiety, nothing else has worked.


Non meds havent worked either (CBT, councelling, very expensive private one on one psychs etc)

Thanks for the warning KETAMAX, you absolutely sure it wasn't bad pills ?

I mean it wouldn't be the first time MDMA pills/powder was cut with something bad.


900mg of Pregabalin is a lot (in my eyes), when i tried it for the first time I had a high heroin and benzo tolerance and

~300-600mg of Pregabalin kicked my ass.. couldn't move, just lie in my bed while my head was spinning so fast.

It was extremely dysphoric and at that time I questioned why people find this enjoyable.


I still can't understand the appeal to abuse Pregabalin when there are benzos and such,


However I have taken Lyrica while being on Amphetamine, did not like it.

But then I have never abused Lyrica recreationally anyway. (well first two times i took higher doses but I did not like the effects)

i love pregs, cant really find another drug that is so recreacional and so unharmful.  i love the drunk ghb style feeling , CEVs, slight dissociation, and  slight stimulation, its like having the best of a lot of drugs but its never either this or that.. its also a great drug to do  mixes,  specially psychedelics.  i also seem to sleep so well after a pregs night, its even better.

very strange that you are having a hard time getting it prescribed for anxiety in the UK.  its not even indicated for GAD in the US and yet you can get it off label.  


you would think a dr would feel more comfortable scripting something that has less addiction potential than benzos.....then again im not sure if your dr is ok giving you benzos.  


the sad thing, and MANY people will confirm this....is that lyrica eventually stops working.  it is a fucking amazingly effective drug but after a few months it just stops working and the only value it retains is once weekly recreation.  


i never thought i would say this but i think i understand why it was not approved for GAD in the US.  maybe they found that it just stops working? i dont know.  im going to give it another shot after several months of being off it.  just having it around in case i run out of benzos is good. also, i did find that taking a decent dose before bed gave me desirable effects the next day.  potentiates benzos too. 


i should have never told my dr i wanted to stop taking it....its good to just have around.  now im going to look like an idiot when i go back and ask to go back on it.  however, i am citing it for neuropathic pain from scoliosis.  ive been waking up in pain, and working out i find one side of my back to be SEVERELY weaker than the other.

ive just been presribed it, but only at 75mg twice a day, will that even help? she said come back in a week to see if the dose needs adjusting.


Im going through mild benzo wd, do you think 150mg spread over the day will even help?

yeah fair enough. 750mg is my recreational dose so i guess, 300 might be cool. i didnt mean 10X before i meant 5X btw never mind though.


tomorrow is my get high on lyrica day but now ive got to go to a job inteview. fucks sake. im gonna take it right before i go in and then hopefully when i get out, the lyrica will be taking effect. thatll be perfect. thats unless theres some kind of delay at the inteview and i end up being wasted when theyre asking me stuff but if it happens it happens.

I started using Lyrica for benzodiazepine withdrawal about a year ago. It did wonders the first few weeks, but tolerance grew rapidly and soon enough I was using 600 mg daily. As it happened I, together with my doctor decided that although I was addicted to clonazepam, the benefits of it outweigh being addicted. So there I was, addicted to both clonazepam and Lyrica.


3 months ago I decided enough is enough, I had no benefits from Lyrica anymore and it just made me groggy and feel slow, which wasn't funny at work. So I decided to quit it. I know witdrawal from Lyrica is very hard, although Pzifer says pregabalin is non-addictive (what a joke, but a sad joke...It's **very** addictive. Try going cold turkey from a year on 600 mg!).


So I decided to taper off, 75 mg every other week, sometimes 75 mg a week if I felt good. I'm now down to only 75 mg a day! ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) It has been hard at times, but I have been resilient and listened to my body. My anxiety rises quite rapidly the days following a lowering of the dose and I also get occassional panic attacks.


After 2-4 weeks, depending on how I feel, I will finally drop the last 75 mg and be free from this drug. I have a huge stack of it and will maybe use it recreationally (**very** occassionally) in the future, but right now I'm just happy I'll soon be free from it.


You have no idea how slow Lyrica makes you when you use 600 mg daily. I felt like it took away 20-30% of my intellectual capabilities at times, especially affecting short time-memory.

Benzo tolerance does have an effect, but be careful with such high doses. There is a high risk for seizures with such high doses, just for being on the safe side take some clonazepam too (has the best anticonvulsant and anti-epileptic effects of all benzos). Even if you have a high benzo tolerace, some clonazepam will minimize the seizure risk.


3000-4500 mg is not a fatal dose, but seizures are a very real risk with those doses. Stay safe ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

There is a high risk for seizures with such high doses, just for being on the safe side take some clonazepam too (has the best anticonvulsant and anti-epileptic effects of all benzos). Even if you have a high benzo tolerace, some clonazepam will minimize the seizure risk.

I'm not too worried about that, I take it with 300mg of temazepam and 300mg of seconal. I feel like a extremely drunk state for about 12-24 hours, (I don't know if thats a good thing)

When I first started doing a large amount alone, I did get tachycardia and it made anxious (obviously). Now it doesn't, about a month later. How much do you ingest?


Holy shit, I just realized I took over 9000mg today over the course of ~7 hours...I don't really feel too much though.

After 2 months breaking i took 50 mg yesterday at night.


normally i always wake up tired even with 8+ hours of sleep and feel fatigue the whole day and alwasy feel i need some sleep.


lyrica makes you dumb in the long run but it helps a ton with getting a good nice resting and gets rid of fatigue.


i think lyrica could be a potential doping for sport its hard to get tired on it but i hear a lot of people actually get fatigue from lyrica.


i actually know a guy that did a running marathon with no experience while downing 150 mg lyrica 

2 hours before the race and had no problem with running or feeling tired till the end

and actually came in at a decent time.

i get this scripted now, and my doctor knows i have a history of benzo abuse but was fine giving me these.


Afaik they are GABA drugs but they work differently to benzos? so they dont down regulate the gaba receptors like benzos do?


Can someone explain to me how they work?


thanks

Yeah, doping is my forte :D or at least i'm most interest in reading and researching those kind of substances. I know i could never use Lyrica for that since even 75 mg makes me tired and 150 mg makes me into a complete zombie (and i have an insane benzo tolerance).

Well temazepam is good for possible seizures too since it has anticonvulsant properties, just don't combine 9000 mg pregablin (or lower doses) with Tramadol, that's a real seizure trigger combination there!


Lyrica has the effect of acting as an anti-epiletic in moderate doses up to 600 mg, but when going higher it actually lowers the seizure threshold and can trigger epileptic attacks.

I've got a question for you guys that are experienced with this drug. So, I am a pain patient and before my opioid therapy was started they tried all sorts of non-narcotic meds on me to make sure that I was taking the least potent drug and dose that would mask my pain. I tried up to 300mg daily with this stuff 150 qAM, 150 qPM and did not receieve any benefit, end result was a treatment change (new drug).

 However I'm currently on opiates and they just aren't cutting it, and I'm wondering if adding this on top of an opiate has helped anyone else, or does it magnify the effect in any way. I'm looking for more non-narcotic relief if I can get it (crazy, I know haha). But honestly, has anyone had any experience with a combination with opiates and did they have positive effects?

i heard about this herb gotu kola so im trying it out. usually i think herbs are a load of shite but this one is good. it has an effect similar to pregabalin but without the dizziness.


so im on a combination of pregabalin 300mg + 3.75g goku cola. seems good feeling relaxed but motivated just loving playing my guitar. much cheerier than usual and enjoying conversations with people and stuff.


im gonna throw in a couple of beers in a wee while. good times.


weird question - do you think you can smoke pregabalin?

dunno how this being a gaba drug and being an anti convulsent at low doses, it can trigger seizures at higher dosage.

i dunno where people get this info about pregablin causing seizures i think it might be ones of those myths that goes around i dunno.


anyway, i went ahead and plugged 150mg of pregabalin. i read reports that its about twice as potent that way so great, its more cost effective. im feeling so pregged up right now ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

i would say that thers not really any benefit to plugging and that its probably better just to swallow it. it hits you faster when plugged but i dont think its any stronger.

I havent taken any opiates but the Lyrica (2x75mg followed by another 2x75mg an hour later) 300mg in total has definately had some effect on the 20mg valium and the 4mg clonazepam that i took at around 8am...its now 3.30pm


The joint i smoked at around 8am worked well also.

I've been on this medication for about 6 months now....Have any of you quit and not gotten any withdrawals?  How many of you did get withdrawals?  Were they bad?

Dude I am still fucking stoned from smoking a shit ton of pineapple kush about 12 hours ago. I feel retarded, plus I took 1.05g pregabalin + 2.4g gabapentin. I'll probably dose a whole gram of Lyrica later on, maybe rail about 300mg. Smoke some more bud.


I was 6 days shy of being 5 months sober, the longest I'd ever been sober in my life. I freaked out and had to fucking smoke weed. I HAD to.

ok here it goes:


i was on lyrica for several months and it was WONDERFUL.  anxiety, depression, apathy were gone. i was uber productive and just loving life.  


then at the 3 month mark it stopped. i started getting irritable, my memory was going, and i was talking to myself a lot!  i also put on an obscene amount of weight (20lbs in 2 months).  so i stopped taking it.  i could take massive amounts and drink and get a recreational effect and kinda feel the effects the next day.


here i am about 4 months after i stopped. i went back on because i have been using klonopin instead and tried using dexedrine to replicate the lyrica effect, yet to no avail.  the klonopin does not do much and i think it actually makes me a little depressed.


so i CAN feel the lyrica again!  NOW I AM GOING TO RESPECT IT. i will NOT take it everyday.  it potentiates the klonopin a lot and helps me not take more than i should.  i try to limit lyrica to the work days when i really need to get stuff done. if i get bored i use a large dose on the weekend.  


thing is i know im going to start putting weight on again(i never lost the weight from the first time i took it).  so it sucks that it makes me feel good but i cant take it everyday.  


just taking klonopin makes me feel kinda depressed and i cant really focus and do lots of work like on lyrica....so its hard to not take lyrica everyday.  shit......i need to find a way to not lose the effect of lyrica.


does anyone have a regimen that helps with this? like take it 3 times a week only?

Well, I think the only sure way to make sure there are no reduced effects is to limit use to once a week max. That would also avoid any problems with addiction and the many harmful effects of being dependent on the drug, never mind quitting. The problem is that those of us who really enjoy Lyrica or find it very helpful are going to want to use it as much as we can. You can limit your use to every two or three days and still feel it, but will still experience a gradual reduction in effects that requires you to either increase the dose or pause/reduce for some time, and you'll probably be physically and psychologically addicted. 


I have stopped with Lyrica 4-5 times after extended use now. Two of those was CT, which I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy. The best is really to detox or maintain with Gabapentin when you want to quit. This works perfectly, and also allows you to lower your tolerance and lose some of that weight. I recently took a break for one and a half month and substitited with Gabapentin and lost around 15 lbs. It doesn't seem to increase your appetite/cause water retention like Lyrica does, which I believe are the main causes of the weight gain. At some point my thighs were so swollen with water I couldn't feel the muscles underneath, pretty disgusting. Gabapentin is also cheaper and easier to get, and not as hard on the body as consistent Lyrica use, as it's less effective.


I wish I didn't like this drug so much, at its best it rivals opiates for me, and I also enjoy the amphetamine-like effect that motivates you to engage in activity and enjoy it. Perfect for studying and writing. But people should really research this drug (and its withdrawals) some more before they let themselves get dependent on it. If you look around, there is a lot of scary stories and reports floating around out there. I know there's a thread somewhere about how it causes dental decay, with a whole bunch of people who ended up ruining their teeth the space of a year, and one who was very upset he needed dentals at age 47, and have also read reports of much more alarming damage. 


Just keep in mind the drug is very new and still in its trial stage. People should be warned that they might be letting themselves in for more than they first imagine. It seems so benign at first, as the side effects are so mild, but that doesn't mean it's not doing serious damage to your body. I'm expecting it to receive a higher regulation, if not being taken off the market completely, but of course the producers are going to hold it off for as long as they can. In my mind, it's best used once a week or less, whether you are after the recreational or therapeutic effects, and more regular use should be avoided if it can be.


Beginners think Lyrica is so innocent and like a miracle-drug, but with time there will probably be more and more with experience saying things like these, and some time in the future it will probably be a household name after being abused by enough kids...

If I may, I think that is a healthy fear. If you try it, you WILL like it, and like any drug it is probably a boat you do not want to willingly hop on. I managed to escape Lyrica withdrawals every time, most probably because I can never make the capsules last any sort of extended period, but from what a lot of people say and I can wholeheartedly understand the truth behind it, pregabalin withdrawal can be worse than opiate withdrawal. In my book that is a version of hell I do not want to visit. The side effects seem to be on the more negative side of the scale than some other drugs, though naturally you don't get something for nothing.


If you are afraid of it, it's probably for a good reason. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

It might be something to be afraid of...I mean, I love it; I've been hooked on Lyrica, Neurontin, or both for 7 years. I've been trying to lower my dose of each because I am prescribed 450mg Lyrica + 3,600mg Neurontin per day. I have been taking much less, then giving in lately for the most part. The pain is awful, I'm burning up, sweating my balls off at work. I haven't let it get to the panic attack point, b/c I have done this many times. I tried to get high on pregabalin, but after taking like 3+ grams I said fuck it. I don't know why I want to cut down. I think I might stay where I'm at with the Neurontin, and just dose Lyrica prn. We'll see.


But yeah, btw, this w/d is horrible. I haven't let it get that bad, but I have both gabapentin and pregabalin. I can say, though, from experience, both Neurontin and Lyrica have absolutely terrible w/ds. Up there with opiates/opioids, except the gaba analog w/d lasts longer.

They had me do a trial of gabapentin, and I thought to myself "Sure, the high's gotta be similar to Lyrica, right?" and I was convinced afterwards that it just wasn't possible for some reason even though Lyrica's just an analogue, then after reading some posts on Bluelight what should have been obvious to me became fact. I know it's a bit off-topic, it's just strange I couldn't get any effect from Neurontin, though as they are cross-tolerant it shouldn't come as much of a surprise, I was prescribed 600mg Lyrica per day and was, of course, taking more than that at the time they tried me on gabapentin.


Yes I have to agree, I absolutely love Lyrica myself. I'm glad I did some more research on it and found out that it binds itself to calcium channels (I think, something like that), it might help me cut down a bit on Lyrica since the last time I was on it, a couple years ago, I was one of those "new users" who thought it was "a miracle drug." Reading this thread brought to light the darker aspect of it. Like losing teeth.

I'm on this medication...I have a feeling I'll be on it for a while.  I am worried about a possible withdrawal.   Having experienced opiate withdrawals, I'm nervous that this will have some bad withdrawals.


Can someone who has taken this long term talk about withdrawal?  How bad is it?  Does the withdrawal even exist?  I'm very curious...

If you're on it from a doctor they should be able to taper you down (well when you want to stop the medication its their job to taper you down)

Plugging is my preferred ROA.


Snorting pregabalin makes me feel like I've ingested some nasty deleriant or smoked a bunch of purely indica herb... it almost feels like an anvil has been placed on my once agile consciousness. It's a "gross" feeling.


Smoking it? Just... don't. Why someone would be so enamored with pregabalin's effects (as great as they are) to attempt smoking the contents of a Lyrica capsule is beyond me - although there WAS that one thread about the guy looking for the right dose of Benadryl to mainline, so I guess foolishness is more prevalent than I had originally thought.


I do really enjoy the effect of just eating the capsules, too. I get the 300's, and generally if I have been good and not taken too many over the past couple of weeks, one or two of those will produce a very pleasing tactile and mentally anxiolytic/motivating experience that is quite different from the effects produced by administering it rectally.


I don't IV drugs anymore, so I cannot comment on IV pregabalin; it sounds, however, like a god-awful idea.

And I've never heard anyone pose the question, "Can I IM Lyrica?" but I suppose that's more comforting than intriguing ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


Been on this stuff for just shy of a year now and have fallen off the recreational pregablin wagon. I'm much more interested in the ways and practices which allow me to gain the most therapeutic effects from my Lyrica. I am grateful to have the prescription, but I use it sparingly (instead of multiple times per day, every day) and my memory's returning, I can shit again (constipation from this stuff is a MAJOR issue for me) and I don't feel so run-down or like I've induced SCT (Sluggish Cognitive Tempo) in myself. Good stuff ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


As homeydontplaythat said he's going to do, RESPECT the stuff, and it will in turn respect you. Abuse it, and the backlash is both disappointing and alarming/nasty.

does anyone get a fast heartbeat on lyrica, its not like a panicky one, but even at my small dose of 150mg twice a day for anxiety, it makes my heart race, does it go away once your body becomes used to it? Its kind of uncomfortable but ive seen it listed as a rare side effect.

Just got my refill, God I can't help it, I love Lyrica. :D But that couldn't have been said any better, drugs are to be RESPECTED for what they do, MISuse is different than ABuse, you can't abuse something you respect and vice-versa.

Yeah, I kinda get a fast heartbeat on this stuff too...it usually occurs around 2-3 hours after ingestion.  It's kinda weird...similar to after smoking a little herb.  I think it may have a slight effect on blood pressure.


Lyrica is really weird stuff.  It's a sedative, yet sometimes it acts as a stimulant at times.  It kinda feels a little dissociative.  Kinda like a cross between having a beer or two and smoking a couple hits of herb.  It's not a great euphoria like cocaine or opiates, but it is pleasant in a weird sort of way.  I'm actually kinda high on it right now ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png).  I wouldn't call it a social drug, more of a chill type drug.  Another weird thing is sometimes it feels a little different, depending on the day, even after taking the same dose.


I wouldn't really call this stuff recreational...it is what it is....

Question:


AFTER the Lyrica takes effect, taken orally of course (why anyone would take it other ways is beyond me, the possible exception being plugging), how long does it last? I'm trying to space it out and take less per dose, but how long after it takes effect does it last?


In other words, how long should I wait in between doses? Mind you I have an extremely high metabolism. My beginning dose is around 1.2g, five 225mg capsules, increased by one capsule in between doses. Just took six being my second dose as this stuff has tolerance issues. Took them at 4:00PM.

^^ even though you dont "feel" the lyrica after 6hours it is definitely still there in the background passively making me feel alright and content with my life..


the high usually peaks in abuot 1-2 hours and lasts 3-4 hours with lingering effects for another 2-4 hours

Haha yeah I started the day with a residual Lyrica high. The reason I said four and 1/2 hours is because it takes around an hour or so, even an hour and 1/2 sometimes, the longest wait I've had with any medication, e.g. Focalin IR taken orally hits in a 1/2 hour, sometimes 45 minutes at the most with me.

weed is also amazing with lyrica...it is a totally different high, probably because they both act on the brain in the same way, more or less

Strangely when I take Lyrica (like right now lol) I want to smoke a bowl. I normally do not like bud, I have ADHD thus when I smoke I'm guaranteed to be up for three or four hours. I can't eat, I can't think, and I'm tired but I can't sleep. It just doesn't do to me the same way it does to everyone else, and I believe it's the ADHD.


Again though, I want to smoke with Lyrica, never have thus far though.

nah i know plenty of people who have ADHD and who smoke daily! it could be your prescribed medicine (adderall, concerta, ect..) if you are taking them.  i tend to enjoy weed with stims but the only down side is the increased heart rate and sometimes unwanted paranoia/panic attacks


i smoke weed daily and i can definitely tell a difference in the high when im on lyrica

Oh I'm not saying it doesn't have a use. Hell I wouldn't have been able to stop meth were it not for weed. I usually don't take meds with bud, guess I just don't like it, but trust me I know plenty of people who find it very helpful, and I know it is.

gonna tell my doc lyrica isnt working out for me, gives me tarchadia, weird fluid retention and makes me shakey, maybe they go away in time, but since this is a tryout for Generalised anxiety order its not really helping ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png) (this is at low dose too.

Lyrica isn't 'FDA-approved' for anxiety, so I'm surprised s/he gave it to you.


Am I the only one that doesn't get tachycardia and shakes and withdrawals on this? I will never say any drug is harmless but so far I haven't experienced any adverse reactions to Lyrica, speaking in present-tense. I realize there will probably be long-term effects, but I haven't seen any negative effects in the immediate sense.

That may explain why it doesn't work for you. I'm on a 450mg dose and I get the shakes and jolts too, but it works for me.


It does even mess with my libido, but strangely I don't care.


Anyway my doc doesn't want me to stay on it, so I'm tapering at the moment.

Prewarning, this is a message to hopefully help others enjoy what they are already doing:


I find that sex, hell playing with yourself for that matter, is MUCH better on Lyrica than not. I guess since it works on the nerves themselves that stimulation in that way is magnified somehow.


Hope you all find this helpful in some way!

lyrica is horrible to me!  i think the lactose binders in the capsules give me a 12 hour allergic reaction that is very unpleasant.  gabapentin on the otherhand, treats me nicely.  except for the withdrawals.

If you're experiencing allergic reactions to it I believe you would certainly be better off not taking it and staying with the gabapentin, as you said you do not have allergy-related symptoms on it.

hmm this is odd, decided to do a recreational dose (which i can handle with benzos on hand plus im telling my doc they're just not working for my anxiety), took 900mg, spread out over 20 minutes, i had a pizza just before, its been 3 hours now and i feel it quite alot, but normally this dose would fuck me up hard, maybe the huge pizza i ate is delaying the onset, getting more wobbly, but its more gradual, alot more pleasent than usual as i get jittery/shakey, no doubt i will start to get a bit shakey but i have some benzos to help when that happens.

Fellows, do u really get lyrica effects by plugging it ? i've tried it few times (150, 300 mg), and felt really nothing, or may be like 75mg orally. I had successfully used amphetamines by plugging, but lyrica... weird. 


Has anyone noticed that taking food while on lyrica high, supresses some positive effects? i also can attribute this to some of GABA drugs (ghb, benzo). 


The downside for me is decreased physical libido, hard to get erection on doses above 300mg, not talking about ejaculation. But girls looks very attractive, so "mental" libido is fine. 


Anyway it's great for work (motivation, pro-social) and recreation (walk, talk, riding bike). Almost OTC in Russia - it's the best thing in drugstores ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

lyrica is best taken orally and on an empty stomach. i have tried all ROAs and oral is simply the only way it works.   food effects it the effects so so much.  


maybe ill take some right now.  it is so strange how it used to calm me and give me energy at the same time. now it just makes me really fucking spastic and i can get shit done but im all over the place. it used to be amazing, not its just like crappy adderall....or i can take a huge dose and get fucked up.....and i do find taking it before i go to bed gives nice effects the next day almost like when i was first taking it. i have to make sure i do it right before im about to fall asleep though otherwise i will be up all night.

I agree. I've never tried plugging it but oral works so well and the BA is so high that I doubt I will ever try it with Lyrica.

ive tried plugging it and i can say that theres no benefit to plugging over oral. theres no point especially because almost all of the drug is used by your body when you eat it.

It is THE most euphoric drug I have ever done (except crack but I am a 'crackhead,' one of the reasons I'm glad I left Cleveland) but it is certainly not harmless, nor is any drug (sorry to some of you but pot isn't harmless, smoke is bad people).


I used to think the same way but I am glad I was able to learn otherwise before terrible things began happening to my body.

do you think pregabalin might take off in a big way as a recreational drug?

My opinion is that while physicians are still pretty openly prescribing it, I think they are not too far out from realizing just how abusable (and euphoric, as one being said, "Til your cup runneth over") that some of the more careless people who are on it will start to come to their appointments like that and give themselves away. I think physicians will start prescribing it more as a 'last resort' drug, not to mention in the U.S. FDA reclassification, before it becomes a wide-spread recreational drug. It will become like crack in the way that the people who have it, want it because in that case it would not be easy to get, and will not put it 'on the streets', thus decreasing wide-spread use in effect before it begins.


I'm not aware of anybody who's been on it that doesn't know it's the best 'happy pill' around, much better than the antidepressants the physicians call 'happy pills.' So whatever happens, I don't think unawareness is an option. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I got prescribed Lyrica today [my psych wanted gabapentin, but I kept talking about how much I read about Lyrica, of course not mentioned it was here on BL, lol, so he was like "okay! Fine. Lyrica." hehehe] for **anxiety**. Apparently in Canada gabapentin and pregabalin are very commonly prescribed for anxiety. In the Canadian shrink manual it is listed as a 3rd resort for GAD my shrink told me [then again, aren't doctors usually full of shit? Except surgeons - they're ALWAYS on the ball].


I took the recommended 75 mg. fell kind of edgy actually. then i started to feel pretty good: relaxed, no depression, lots of motivation. so I took another 50 mg. After that I genuinely felt that MDMA-like high that people talk about - like SSRI's without the weird-ass side effects. I feel a definite, very tangible - can't remember the term I'm trying to - "touchy feely-emotional" effect, like E but not as forceful. Music sounds much clearer, I feel more enveloped by reality. I took 6 T3s too -- the last of the pain pills I managed to squeeze out of my surgeon 2 weeks after the surgery [I'm finally starting to forget the godly days right after the operation when he scripted me 40 dilaudid 2's and I had a box of brand new rigs ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png) ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) happy, tragic opiate addiction, has near ruined my life]. 


and that's why I wanted the Lyrica. I really think it will help me get over opiate addiction. Weed doesn't work because a) it has insanely huge list of psychological effects, including apathy and paranoia, and b) makes you hyper, thus leading to cravings and relapse. Alcohol and benzos are even worse, lowering your inhibitions and making you tired and depressed: the exact state of mind you were in when you decided to lay in the bear-trap of opioid habituation. Fuck that shit!

I will never say any drug is harmless but so far I haven't experienced any adverse reactions to Lyrica, speaking in present-tense. I realize there will probably be long-term effects, but I haven't seen any negative effects in the immediate sense.

As mentioned above, the European Union has approved pregabalin for the treatment of GAD; possibly GAD comorbid with panic disorder, I'm not sure of the latter. But American pharmacists took this as a "Let's go!" attitude to prescribing Lyrica. I have been on this stuff for a WHILE, before they even began marketing it. This was mid-2004, early 2005. Was on it for about 18 months and then discontinued it. Back then, I was at a 50mg dose BID and did not know that it was abusable. This time around I'm older; wiser; more pregabalin'd than ever ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


It does lose its magic.


You are not the only one who doesn't get all the withdrawal symptoms mentioned in countless posts on topics like Lyrica. I just don't get it - in fact, I understand it about as much as I understand how an AED can reduce anxiety, stimulate motivation, optically saturate the colors of the world, and place one in a headspace similar to that of a light dose of MDMA (60-80mg, depending on who you are, would be my guess). So, yeah. No withdrawal symptoms, ever, and I'm on 450-700mg of the stuff a day. Oh, well; you won't find me complainin' ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)


I agree with other posters who have tried rectal administration of this drug. I used to do it habitually, every day for two months, and felt (as I was laying on my back or left side, waiting) the "rush" of that which is the headspace in a "Lyrica high." It's completely impossible to explain to someone who's never tried plugging pregabalin. After a bit, though, it affected me - but not so rapidly. Ever so slowly I become more and more cumbersome and loopy and less and less aware of time. Color is *so* brightly it's saturated. And I float! :D


The absolute best way is to take it orally, as mentioned, WITH OUT FOOD!!! I can't stress this enough; food will not only prolong the onset and delay/lower the Cmax, so you don't get as much out of the experience as you would otherwise.


In the past couple months, I've stopped abusing Lyrica. I take it exactly as prescribed and I'm absolutely fine with that.

I took an extra 50 mg my first day, but I don't think Ill even try reaching a high. since im on 75 mg a day for first week, then up to 100 mg a day for the next 2 months until i see my shrink again probably, if I eat like 10 of them to get high I will deprive myself ultimately of like 2 weeks or a month. that deosnt seem worth it for a mild high. ive gotten high off gabapentin before, and actually started taking smaller doses back when my friend gave me a bag of it, because its really better in small doses that act as a mild painkiller and anti-anxiety/depressant. however most likely curiosity will get the best of me soon and ill eat like 4 days worth in one go. but then what will i do for the days I have to do without? doesnt seem worth abusing something that works, but doesnt give the intense high of a hard drug like dilaudid or oxy or adderall or whatever.


im broke though, so it is mildly tempting. but if i wanna get high, ill eat the rest of my klonos [shrink dicontinued them. which is good for my soul, i know, LOL; benzos are pretty evil] or i dunno, steal a box of DXM from the fucking pharmacy, LOL. or go on methadone or something. [i heard lyrica enhances opiates, so it might make being on methadone or suboxone fun, if i can find a clinic that isnt full, or a doctor willing to prescribe opiates off-label for maintenance]

Whats the deal with mixing low dose of benzos in with pregabalin? When i take a recreational dose (600mg+), i start to get the shakes and feel a bit anxious, its still pleasent but i feel strungout, im thinking of popping a few 10mg vals to smoothen it out, anyone have any expereience?


thanks

the highest dose ive done is 200 mg eaten, but 125 mg snorted was stronger. snorting lyrica i find makes it much more potent since it hits you faster. when i snorted 125 it was almost too strong for me. i had that "what do i do NOW??" feeling of MDMA and suchlike. so i did take 1 mg of klono and felt alright.


i could see 600 mg definitely being sketchy. i wouldnt bother doing that much ever i dont think. what's it feel like??? sure, pop a couple valiums, why the fuck not?


IMPORTANT:

I have a question about lyrica dependence. on doses of 50-100 mg a day, after several months, would you get dependent enough to get WDs if you stopped? Or even if you weaned off? My guess is no -- seems to only happen to people who get used to daily doses well above 300mg...but still. reading all these lyrica horror stories on the fuck internet is getting me antsy. So far its working great for my anxiety though - longer lasting than any benzo and without the depressing "down"... but I did have a couple irritable-mood-swings on it. Well it's only week two. so we'll see.

well you should feel withdrawal by day 3 i think.


i guess on my dose, 50 -100 mg a day, it really shouldnt be a concern. i dont usually get much withdrawal from benzo or opiate abuse so im good that way. feel bad for people who suffer through withdrawals really bad.

This is an interesting and useful drug if used sensibly. I think it's somewhat similar to GHB in its effects. GHB was a drug I loved during the noughties when it was legal, as it was very effective for social anxiety and made me pro-social almost.


Lyrica in my experience acts as a social lubricant like GHB and alcohol. Even a low 75mg dose can have quite an effect. It doesn't completely take away anxiety or make you pro-social, but it does help when speaking to people and making eye contact etc.. I have tried high doses, all the way up to the recommended max dose of 600mg. In my experience you don't get much from these high doses as it makes you too intoxicated and fucked up to function or even walk straight. 


I have stopped using Lyrica lately in favour of Buspar and opiates, but I might start using it again as I have some left over.

it loses it harmless status after a couple of months.


it seems there is no such thing as the wonder drugs but it would be lyrica if all those side effects wouldn't become more and more dominant after longer use.'

This drug is amazing for the fact that I have never found any drug to completely rid me of anxiety (except phenibut but that was only after weeks of dosing daily). Even 75mg is enough for this effect but much better at 150mg. I can see it being very recreational however I wouldn't wanna abuse this one. I might have actually learnt something from phenibut addiction.

I have no tolerance to Lyrica, I'm 6 ft and 200 pounds, what would 700 mg of the shit do? would i pass out/black out? Could i control my self and nod out like on opiates? I have a natural tolerance to medication, like the first time i took xanax it was 3mg and the first opiate it took 40mg.

If you don't have any tolerance to it, 700 mg would probably put you to bed. Really I doubt you'd need more than maybe 150 mg of the shit your first time. Try that as a starting dose and work your way up, remember that it takes a couple of hours to kick in though.

first time i would say 300-450 mg max.


700mg prob will make you feel fine but it doesn't add much other then tolerance even  450 mg i wouldn't advise for tolerance for a first time user.


its one of that type of drugs that is hard to go back to a small dosage again  the higher you go the less effective it becomes overtime.

Stopped pregabalin daily intake (450mg/day) cold turkey, and the mighty weed proved itself very useful to stop the thing. No major withdrawals.

300 mg is best taken when on a empty stomach to maximize its effects (although 300mg works well for me even when eaten although i nowadays never take more then 150mg)


The not walking straight thing is one of the effects lyrica has on people but there should be at least some kind of body buzz / happy feeling along with it.

take into account that it can take up to 4-5 hours to feel effects when there is food in the stomach/system.

So prob the drugs kicked in while you where sleeping.


for me most of the time i get a motivational / energetic feeling with a weak body buzz.

its def a weird drug with a lot of potential outcomes on the effects (sedate, hungry,energize,happy thoughts ,groggy,frustration etc etc

some days the drug seems to barley work other times i am sky high

Its def. not for everyone.


I found that redosing the same day doesn't do much to anything .


So far the few friends of mine that tried lyrica all got a nice buzz from 150 mg there first time and experienced it as very pleasant.


i would say if 450-600mg doesn't give pleasant effect its not for you i wouldn't experiment with much higher.

i started using lyrica because i got a script for my chronic pain after a bicycle accident a couple years ago


it helped a ton with my pain but i also experienced a nice high next to it.


i had to tapper down and quit after almost a year use because the side effects became worse and worse (even on 50 mg)

i became too confused to function and had a hard time remembering anything.

it made thinking impossible.


Doing things without even knowing you did them can be quit scary.


talking to people also became harder and harder sometimes, making words up i wasn't planning to say or don't make any sense.


it can def fuck you up even without abusing it in the long run.


nowadays i use 150 mg once or twice a week from what i have left over from my script.

it seems the only way to use it now to get most of the good benefits (pain relief , subtle high) 

without to much of the negative side effects

It still works for me after almost 6 weeks on it. although i havent taken it every single day -- days off here and there. i think tolerance and withdrawal, as with any drug, is dependent on the user. i tend not to experience either with any drug very easily, probably due to a strong immune system.

^^^ Good to hear. I recognize the recreational value of this drug, but using it as intended for anxiety has been a godsend. I'm currently taking around 200mg about 3-4 times a week. My 'recreational' dose is around 300 - 400mg, and I rarely do that.

Ive been doing the same recreational dose as you, a little too often. but i am getting a refill of my clonazepam in less than 2 weeks so its not too bad. i also like to have days here and there not on any psychoactive drugs whatsoever.


for sure, lyrica can be amazing. i have experienced paradoxical irritability and edginess from it sometimes but usually it results in a mild but very helpful feeling of contentment and calmth and analgesia,without the addictive strength of opiates or benzos


the right dose can result in some pretty high level euphoria of course. but it doesnt seem to be any more addictive than other soft drugs like for example pot.


all this said, though, i am guessing it does result in tolerance sooner or later, like any mentally active drugs. it just might take longer to develop in some people. [from what ive read, with lyrica this ranges from 2 weeks to 2 years. so that's pretty hopeful data to me ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I have been on Lyrica for several years and one time I ran out early and the withdrawals are horrific!  It's pretty much just like any opiate w/d's, but it lasted quite a few days and nothing seemed to help.  I even had some hydrocodone at the time & that didn't even help!

Starting this drug soon, I am interested in it's anxiety and and sleep architecture benefits, I have been using clonazepam for the last 6 months, although I have only started using it daily over the past month, I tried going three days without it and I felt withdrawals. I was using alcohol and antihistamines to get to sleep, wasn't working well and gave in and had to have some clonazepam, I felt it kick in and just felt 'normal' so I guess that is withdrawals, which is scary, I felt very dull and there was a feeling I couldn't quite put my finger on, in my head, sort of like I was going to pass out or something, maybe panic attack feeling but not quite the same feeling, not sure, I'll assume thats withdrawal because I felt like shit, worse than a hangover. I'm starting Lyrica for other reasons but I'm hoping that if this has a benefit on my sleep in general (by helping the insomnia and stage 3 & 4 sleep cycles) I should be able to get a sleep routine down and be able to tackle my anxiety better. I don't want to be on these drugs forever, or any for that matter.


I'm being prescribed 25mg, I don't want to use this daily, so I need to approach this properly, I do not care about the recreational potential so I won't be looking at a dose that is going to get me high. I need and opinion on how many days I should use this, I'm thinking 3-4 days a week before bed and then tapering the amount of days until I completely stop this drug, I know it sounds weird but I would like to achieve getting over clonzepam withdrawal while helping my sleep and in the end having either drug as something for emergencies. I fucked around with the clonazepam in the beginning because I wanted to get high, I'm not going to make the same mistake with this drug. So yeah any opinions are appreciated, I need to tackle this, lifes getting far too hard, I don't want a drug addiction, which it feels like Is just starting.

wow only 25 mg a day? and i thought my daily dose of 100 mg was small. from what ive read to get properly addicted to lyrica a daily dose of over 300 mg for more than 3 months is needed [same as opiates and benzos really -- a medium or high dose for longer than 3 months, at first anyway]


as long as you take breaks at least every 3 weeks or so you shouldnt get physically hooked. lyrica is fairly mentally addictive but no more than weed, if that


edit: I'm running out well before my refill, and that's because I take more than prescribed sometimes in order to get mildly "high". Also, if I can't sleep, after tossing and turning for a couple hours I might take a few Lyrica, which knocks me out cold once it kicks in and gives me a deep and pleasurable sleep, without affecting sleep architecture, apparently [unlike benzos don't even help that much for sleep except in high doses, or maybe xanax or temazepam, and deprive you of any dreams and often knock you out for at least 8-10 hours]. 


I might add that Remeron [mirtazapine], is the most powerful sleep aid I've ever taken - I've fallen asleep sitting down 20 minutes after taking it, without being tired beforehand, it just knocks you out right when it kicks in, basically [it's a struggle to even brush your teeth if you haven't before it kicks in] and FORCES you to sleep for at least 11 hours, but more like 12-14 usually. Basically, WAY TOO powerful a sleep aid!

Absolutely. Give it 6-8 weeks. I'm in the same boat; prescribed for anxiety, felt that it helped me in a diverse array of areas in my life (depression, motivation, anxiety, interpersonal interaction, positivity, minor pain relief), and then *poof* all of a sudden the negatives vastly outweighed the positives! What happened?? Why did this miracle drug turn its back on me? God only knows, but I have learned to take my 450mg/day only once every other day and it prevents my body from rejecting the pregabalin... or vice versa. I realize you're likely on a lower dose, but I was on 75mg/day when the "magic was lost"...


Hope it doesnt happen to you, man. If it does, PM me and I'll outline exactly how I worked around the problem to gain benefit again from this substance.

Totally agree; re-dosing on Lyrica is next to pointless. It *may* extend the experience (and of this I am still dubious...) but it definitely does not heighten the experience.

I am picking up a script today of 300mg caps.  I can take about 3000mg neurontin and feel fine.  I dosed that last night.  Prescribed for pain and to stay away from opiates. Doesn't really help with pain; honestly nor did the opiates.  How bad is the cross tolerance to Gabapentin?  If I did 3000mg last night.  What dose should i start out today for a recreational use?  Or is it pointless to try since I have a high tolerance and these drugs are similar?  I felt nice on the 3000mg Neurontin.  I was thinking 600mg Preggo today?  Thoughts?

I dont know how neurotin compares to pregabalin in terms of strength? but i usually take 1000mg of pregabalin in one go for  recreational use, then few hours later i might have another 300-500mg to top up a little bit. However i have pushed it to around 2000mg before but i find it sometimes give me really uncontrollable and unpleasant twitches which can actually be quite scary.

Could one completely quit benzos (klonopin) from using this drug?  I just took my recommended daily dose (2X 300 mg) but I took it at once.  I am at hour two and the feel is akin to Gabapentin.  I can't say it's better or worse yet; seems like the consensus is that it is better.  However, it "feels" like I could just not use any klonopin and quit (have been on them for YEARS). I know all about the withdrawal risk of cold turkey of benzos and am very aware of drugs.  This is not a benzo and doesn't affect the same receptors but is a GABA drug.  So would it be safe to just stop the benzo (currently just taking about 1.5mg of klonopin at night).

if an iv opiate user tried lyrica what would it do for them can lyrica be used in iv form or no? but if the person is trying to get off the opiates would a doctor possibly prescribe this med because they have chronic pain and the fact that coming off of opiates makes them have anixety

injecting lyrica would be totally stupid. it would be dangerous and you wouldnt get any benefit over just eating it.

I watched a friend who is an IV heroin addict shoot 300mg of Lyrica; he said it had no stronger an effect than taking it orally, the only difference was that it kicked in just slightly faster, but not by much and it has no rush. So...take what you will from that.

I find this shit pretty addicting to be honest.  I find the feeling is a harmonious mix of alcohol, weed, and MDMA (I know this sounds weird, but I kinda do roll on this shit).  It's not nearly as addicting as opiates of course, but I find it more pleasant than Xanax or other benzos.

I'm not sure, but if there is a generic lyrica, that would be gnarley. This gabapentin doesn't work so great; I still feel like there's a knife in my back.

Here is what you do: Get some Gabapentin/Neurontin to detox with. It is weaker, cheaper, and more easily available. Taper down over a course of a month, and you should be fine. Never stop Lyrica cold turkey. It is like stopping a mix of opiates and benzoes cold turkey. You MUST taper down. Even with Lyrica, but I would prefer the Gabapentin to get the Lyrica out of your body because it's stronger and much nastier.


There are many who don't know about the Lyrica withdrawal you can get when you stop cold turkey after abusing it or taking therapeutic doses. It is worse than a moderate opiate addiction, I would say. More like a combined opiate/benzo addiction. Just imagine. But it's much worse than a moderate opiate withdrawal. First you get the same symptomps with fever, vomitting and diarrea. But there is much more with Lyrica. You feel as you have fucked up your body and the depression. And while in opiate withdrawal you just lie in bed like you have the flu, when you stop Lyrica you get hyper stimulated and high blood pressure and also problems with breathing. So you can't get any rest and want to walk around all the time. Then at night you lie in bed sweating, unable to sleep, firts chilly, then hot, then your skin is super sensitive and you feel uncomfortable in the bed sheets. You wake up sweating and your bed is drenched, smells like horrible bacteria, have to take two showers a day. And the WORST thing about it is that unlike opiate withdrawal there is no improvement from day to day, it can even get worse, and it lasts longer, when one day is like hell on Earth. After 10 days I was ok, felt quite normal, just craving the drug. Worst experience of my life, bar none.


If you have gone and got yourself addicted to Lyrica, or are on a script that could be abruptly stopped, please take some precautions to avoid this hell:


Things that are good to have around:


Opiates + benzoes. Preferably both. They take care of the overstimulation, depression, anxiety and the physical symptoms. I used that for a week after quitting cold cold turkey and was comletely ok. But if you think about it, Lyrica is like a combination of opiates and benzoes. It helps lots.


Phenibut, if nothing else might help. It also works on Gaba. And mixed with some Valerian pills it totally knocks you out. Theanine can also help a bit. I took it with some magnesium and hops and felt 50% better for a while. Not sure which it was that worked. 


Also tons of Vitamin C if you have it. Buy it in powder form and you can use like 50-100 grams a day. It is supposed to keep WD away alone by binding to the receptors, but I have never tried that. Either way, high doses of Vitamin C always helps when you're sick.


You want Sleeping pills, cause you won't be able to sleep . So make sure you have some. Zoplicone, seroquel, valium, or whatever gets you to sleep.


But really all this can be avoided if you just stock up on a moths supply og Gabapentin. I suggest a box of 100 600mg, and you might be ok with one or two a day.


Also some GOOD NEWS I have discovered about Lyrica for those who are dependent and in danger of going cold turkey: The amount you are using is not necessary the amount your body needs to stay ok. Say, if you take 1000 mg every other day, or whatever your pattern is. This is a lot of drugs and your body won't be able to make use of it. Even if it makes you more high, it's surplus for your body and it's not dependent 

on that amount. 


So if your usual dose is 1200 this is not the amount of drug your body is dependent on. That is more likely 300-600. a is so expensive and it can also save you days of withdrawal if you can't afford or your doctor won't give you a script for it. This is great as it means you might only have to experience half of your period of withdrawal, or take some days of it, maybe avoid it completely. This is good to know as Lyrica is good to know because every Lyrica WD day is a day in hell.


So please follow my advice and you avoid Lyrica hell. It's not really that hard when you know what to do and is prepared for it. Trust me, it's not an experience you will want, even just for one day.

Mixing Lyrica and Soma is a no no. It knocks you out cold and makes you sleep for hours. Even if you take only one Soma with it. The same applies to Gabapentin. A shame, as I was interested to see if there was some synergy there, and apparantly it was, but not the kind I was hoping for. Like awaking up 9 hours later. Too much Gaba I guess. While Soma + Opiates is great. Lyrica + Opiates is bliss. It also really heightens the opiate experience, like if you have an opiate you can't feel anymore, you can feel it if you take it with Lyrica.

take lyrica as suposed to be, this you get the most of the medicinical effects out of it eg. anti-anxiety!!!


i've dosen up to 2000g and it's not worth it!!!


sorry some people claim it feels like mdma!!! what a crap...nothing in the world can feel like poor mdma


...nothing even ever levels the magic of real mdma.... the 4000mg of oxycodon iv have tagen over a timeline of ca 200 days as crushed 40mg retard tablets really never.never come 


even in the slightest sense close to a real mdma magic experience! real mdma is like heaven on earth!!! there are so many pills going around


with every shit in them and some people claim they have used mdma...never orget it. 150-180mg of pure mdma produces a feeling of euphoria 


that can't be described , It's in your stomach and your gonna explode of bliss! no drog except a ultrla mystical experience of lsd can be comperd 


to this trancedent feelings overpowering euphoria .!!!!    Real mdma is agivt from heaven!!! and should be taken only several times a year....


overdoing it will give you depressons you have never experienced.

Thank the lord,.. there is a god.   And he made my doctor put me on Pregabalin. 


 After 6 years of been on Lithium and Quetiapine for my bipolar at last i actually get put on something good i can play with. Id never even heard of it and wasnt to into the idea.  But when i came home and looked it up i found this thread. straight away it got me thinking. 


So they started me off on like 50mg capsules and i took like 350 straight away. had a slight kind of mellowness. everything seemed really cool. And as they are meant to do they really helped me to feel relaxed about things. anyhow 2 weeks later i went to see my doctor and he stepped it up to a weeks worth of 75mg and another weeks worth of a 100 mg.  feeling a bit more confident about things, and after much reading on here, i took 2-3 of the 75mg and then gradually started having some of the 100mg. I spread it out as i havent really done this before and honestly i didnt intend to take that many. But by the end of the night id had 6 of the 100mg. Over say about 3-4 hours.   


I think next time ill definitely do them closer together. maybe try 2 at a time. Ill be on 150mg by then. anyhow i can definitely confirm that pregabalin can be used recreationally. Its also quite a cool chilled kinda buzz. just felt really good about things. my vision went a bit blurry and i was like staring at a screen for 5 minutes trying to make out words n shit. it did like many said also effect my balance. but y'know what it was kinda funny. made me laugh anyhow. Big plus as well as it lasts fucking ages. hours and hours and then i woke up this morning and i was still kinda off it. very dazed and confused although partly this is down to my quetiapine i have to take. nonetheless i was feeling pregabalin well on into the day. 


At the end of the day im only getting a limited supply and i do need to take 2 of these these daily. but ive decided once every 2 weeks or so im gonna have a bit of a go with this stuff. really well chuffed with my luck to get put on this.

I totally agree about the dosage if its ur 1st time with lyrica.I actually just took 2x 200mgcapsules,and reading this thread I said "what da hell" and snorted a third one.But I remember when I used to take gabapentin when I was withdrawing,or just to potentiate my opiate dose.At first 300 would get me 'good'.Floaty feeling,chill almost like weed high.And a few weeks ago I took about 4x400mg(1200mg) gabapentin and went for a walk to get cigs.Then I think I popped 4 more,and let me tell it was kinda hard to walk.I did feela bit scared at first,which made me have minor shakes.But I got back home and layed down,and felt better.But I was pretty fucked up.


So,now Im on 600mg of lyrica as we speak.I took em to calm down from taking 20mgadderall xr.And I also have a 10mg valiumfor when I go to bed.I should also mention that I've been taking between 0.5-2mg of suboxone to curb my opiate withdrawls from oxycodone for the past 3 weeks.I usually take between 30-60 mg oxy daily. But they run out quick because my girlfriend shares her script with me.But I find that Lyrica/gabapentin help tremendously during withdrawls,and also to potentiate my opiate dosage.


Anyways if its ur first time with lyrica/gabapentin,start out low(300/gabap;100/lyrica) Also tolerance on these drugs goes fast.Especially if you take em everyday.So,if you like the drug high,space your days of intake.If you take them days in a row,ur gona need more and more to get the desirable effects.


Sorry if what I write seems like its 'everywhere',Im just trying put in my 2cents.Today is actually my first time taking lyrica,but I am accustomed to the gabapentim 'high'.If I come up with anything new about this drug,I will defenitely post more.

Hello there, this is my first post. 


I was prescribed Lyrica at 150 mg/day for my GAD /state of chronic anxiety. I'm also being  prescribed Ativan at 1mg/day on an as needed-basis.  I found the Lyrica very mellowing and helpful to fight the anxiety, but I also noticed tolerance creeping in after several weeks of continuous use. So here's my question: Will cycling the two meds help reduce tolerance and keep the Lyrica working? How about potential tolerance /addiction risks from the Ativan if I take it, say, 3x a week at this dose? any help or comment would be welcome! 


Greetings from Germany! %)

About a gram should do ya fine.  Take it slow, start with 800-900mg and evaluate after T+1:45.  Pregabalin peaks around the 3-4 hour mark.

A gram, I took 750 mg and was off my face, and with a strong afterglow the next day!  I had also taken some Etizolam (similar to Alprazolam) and maintenance dose of Poppy Tea.


Today I've  taken a lower dose ~400g to see if I have a more moderate experience, and because I'm working tomorrow and have got shit loads to do.

I fucking love this drug. It's cleaner and more euphoric than alcohol/G, way more intoxicating than benzos, and gives me great visuals as well. Like, with closed eyes, 3D webs of yellow and red and green. Vivid stuff. Anyone else get anything visual from this? I mean, not like blurred/double vision, but trippy stuff? I think it's probably just an idiosyncratic reaction and that I'm really lucky.

I always get CEVs from it if I go over 600mg. Weed & pregs gets nice visuals as well.

I dont get psychedelic effects, but deep relaxation and euphoria.  Am new to using Pregablin, but it is now one of my favourites.  Synergises well with Benzos and opiates, but be careful not to over do it.  


It was the Etizolam that help give me strong effects from 750 mg.  Took 450 mg today, did not have much effect, but now 4 hours later I've taken 0.5 mg of Etizolam amd I can feel the sedation and warmth building.


Will limit Pregablin to Friday nights, so I don't get tolerance or dependence, and because the strong next day effects would affect my work.

The consensus seems to be that regular use leads to rapidly diminishing favourable effects. I use it rarely, and it's great every time.

Yeah, I tried it at 400mg and at that dose it is nothing special, 600-800 is my sweet spot.

After Several weeks of experimenting I've found It best to give it AT LEAST a week between goes. Ive tried giving it just a few days break and then a few days more and what you get from Pregabalin definitely goes down hill fast even when increasing the dose. Unless of course giving it a good 7 day break and going back to it.


I was new to this and initially started off experimenting at around 600mg.  IM now up to taking 1500mg but take it through the course of 3-4 hours. IT takes a good few hours to start feeling the effects (in a real sense) but by the end i would say that im off my head on this stuff. I normally take 600 to start and add a 3oomg every half hour/45mins or so. Done this way and its a night in in its own right lasting hours and hours and hours. The amount of time it lasts is like nothing else I've ever taken.


I have had some visuals and music too is very enjoyable.  I've seen things in the darkness but my favourite is getting the visual effects up on the windows media player and staring into the crazy psychedelics. Strangely fascinating!!

That's what I thought at first, especially if you just use it once a week, though taken every 2 or 3 days it also gives a pleasent effect (something between therapeutic and recreational). But the effect of this drug has changed for me with time. After going through a horrendous 10 day WD which almost killed me I couldn't really get any effects from it anymore. Then after maybe six months time it started working again, cause I would keep trying it. Then after a little break the last time I took it it would just put me to sleep as soon it started to come into effect so I couldn't really get anything out of it.


I think my body doesn't quite know how to use this chemical. It probably doesn't see it as a beneficial thing, though I am confused how it can block the effects. But Lyrica is not very good for your body. It does more harm then we realise as it feels so harmless with no hangover or toxic feeling, but it screws with your nervous system pretty bad. It's a shame as it's also such a therapeutic drug, the best anti-deppresants or anxiety reliever I've ever tried. 


But watch out what it does to you and try to avoide becoming dependent on this drug. I wouldn't really say it's not worth the WD, but it was still the worst experience of my life. Though when you taper down with Gabapentin you seem to be completely fine. Give it a month's time at least.

Yes. Or ghost-like figures in the outlines of your vision even. I have also had strange, dreamy experiences, like reading through a bunch of articles in a few short moments  and absorbing lots of information (through my mind).

Haven't taken lyrica in a while, just got 300mg a day filled. Was thinking of doing 1200mg, I want some visuals. I take 4mg clonazepam every day and have taken all 4mg today. I know people say, and according to the facts, it should be true, that benzos and lyrica potentiate the shit out of each other. I have 16mg+ kpin I can use on whatever I want.


Should I go with or without the clonazepam, I want visuals and I was thinking the kpins would diminish the possibility of that, any recommendations? Cause I could go with 1200mg and a lot of clonazepam for a really good time and ultimate relaxation, or just the lyrica in just in hopes of visuals.


Too bad the clonazepam wouldn't have the possibility of increasing visuals. Also going to be smoking a lot of top notch weed.

I have been scripted 150 mg twice a day. I got to say it is very dynamic for my anxiety and aches from depression. I have yet to get tolerance from therapeutic use since it came out basically.


I only get the anxiety that was already there when i run out and can't afford my next script.


I get super smashed sometimes... 600 mg lyrica with liquor and 10 mg ambien... I couldn't walk. I had to sit. Every time I blinked, there would be the "geometric line tunnels." I ended up snorting some too.


I slept flawlessly.

Anyone noticed hair loss while on lyrica?? If so was it permenent or after stopping lyrica it came back? I noticed it as a side effect that I don't quite understand I know it is rare but still is it supposed to be permenent ? What if you dose once a week? I been dosing 600-2000mg for about 8 months mostly daily.

This stuff sounds pretty interesting to me. Not only for the way it can enhance opiates but also in its own right. Although I read somewhere that you may need to take it for several days (a week -10 days) in a simillar way to SSRI anti-depressants for the substance to begin to take effect.


Is this true, or does it have more or less immediate effects ?


Thanks in advance.

Hello mate, you can feel the effects from the first dose, great for taking with opiates but keep the dose low. Really good for anxiety! I think they say 10 days full the full threputic effects to take hold

How would one use Lyrica to taper off of a benzodiazepine habit?  Currently 60mg of temazepam (or 30-40mg of diazepam, per the charts) daily keeps me well, but that dose has been higher.  I have a little over 12 grams of pregabalin at my disposal, and 24x10mg zolpidem just in case.  600-700mg of Lyrica is my usual tolerated rec dose, by the way.  Also, has anybody noticed sharp kidney pains the day after?  Every time I take more than 450mg at once they light up like fire around 24-36 hours later, without fail.  Feels like two fireballs in my lower quadrants, and hurts like hell.  Makes me jump from my chair, too.  Anyways, I have no other option but to use pregabalin to taper off, and don't care about losing the 'magic' right now - benzo dependency fucking sucks.

Hmmm... I have 700mg of Lyrica from last year sitting in my drawer. I'm thinking about taking it after finals, early morning so I can enjoy the effects all day. I have 5mg diazepam and 0.25mg alprazolam; small doses of benzos are supposed to go well with it, and reduce seizure risk from a high dosage.


How should I take it? 5mg diaz and 700mg Lyrica in one go? Forget the alpraz?

Is it safe to take Kratom (maintenance; 1-2g) or tramadol (maintenance; 0.25mg-50mg) with it?

Yeah, I take tramadol with Lyrica everyday for fibromyalgia. It's a great combo and works amazingly.


As far as getting fucked up, it's safe to take the benzos with the high dose of Lyrica you're wanting to take. It's all good. You could take all that shit (the 700mg Lyrica, 5mg diaz, and .25mg alpraz) together. Those are not high doses of benzos unless you are very sensitive. You'll feel great but you may be kinda wasted (I suppose that's the idea, lol).

You could use Opiates to allow downtime from Opiates if pain is really bad and persistant (though remembering Opiates are one of the post addictive class of drugs.  I find my opiate/ dependance/ daily use) helps prevent problems with Benzos.  Am also on SSRI's.

For me it challenges Opiates for top spot, and I lurve Opiates!  I usually use just over 1000 mg along with 1-2 mg of Etizolam (atypical benzo).

I've dosed grams in the past and am quite familiar with the ins and outs of good ole Lyrica but does anyone else get a nice mood lift along with euphoria and energy from a dose like 100mg.... its kind of a surprise but without tolerance that's what I've been getting out of it.

Just thought I'd throw in some input as some people seemed to want to hear from Europe ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png), I'm from Ireland and am currently on 300mg/x2 Daily its for nerve pain that i got from a car crash a few years back i it mostly use to for recreational use's though. For my first time on the drug i popped 3x300mg Pills and still didn't feel much from the drug, i started building up pills when i didn't need them for the pain and tried 1500mg a few times gotta says its much better like this i didn't seem to experience what some people say they did off 150 and i took 6 times that first time ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png) Maybe i have some sort of tolerance though i wasn't on much drugs before

1200mg isn't a lot; it's only twice the daily dose. Seizures are listed in the 'rare' side effects section of the PIL.

Hey guys , my first post here. I have been on Lyrica for the past 3 years 600mg for Anxiety. Previously I have came off Opiates, nothing major codeine and dihydrocodeine. The thing about this lyrica withdrawal is the bloody anxiety and its for me the real stomach wrencing type, combined with mild depersonalisation and generally looking at the world in an unfriendly way ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)

omg I love Lyrica,I just wish I could afford i as I have no insurance..I take 900 mg's a day..(2 150 mg capsules 3x a day) If I go 3 days without it which I often do my tolerance goes back down and I can have a happy day on fridays .lol but I have found if you take it everyday you get use to it,I also take 90 mg's of methadone a day so I do no go through withdrawels from the lyrica when I stop taking it..but yeah it's a grat drug and watch out it will make you eat the kicthen table!!!

For me Lyrica is much stronger and the buzz(if you want to call it that)is kinda  stronger.The only thing I hate about lyrica is the appetite Issue I have.Being on a diet and lyrica DO NOT MIX WELL!  Ugh I took up to 3600 mg's a day of gabapentin and my DR finally just put me on Lyrica so I would have to take less pills. BUt Gaba is good in it's own way...I just had to skip doses if I could and go 3 or 4 days so when I took it I would feel more,the tolorance thing with Gaba and lyrica is crazy...it builds so fast!

I just took 600mg of Lyrica last night and it f***d me up. I'm still feeling it this morning. Bumping into things. Very unsteady on my feet. I don't drink alcohol but this is what I imagine being drunk feels like.

I'm RX'd Lyrica 300mg BID, and use it sparingly like once a week/two weeks. Only time I use it more frequently is to potentiate my RX'd opiates, but luckily opiates dont fail me often.

i started on an intolerably high dose when i first dropped lyrica -- 600mg. shouldn't have done that. that was december of 2010. i'm unusually sensitive to pills. hard drugs? nope. the walls caved in and shimmered red, red everywhere, and i loved everything and puked. o god, the puking. since june of 2011, i've had a 2gram/day habit. GABA crave. massive natural depletion. i was a lucky cocktailer of drugs, hard and soft, so i'm a bit thrilled to only be on one thing at the moment. but the effects were/are so deliciously intoxicating. for me, it's a divine amalgamation of an opiate, benzo, DMT, XTC, alcohol and *i*ts own personal ambien** all in a baby's glistening fistful of pills on a humid Spring eventide next to a *bushel of lilies*. ...i don't even know if they come in *bushels*. but they *do on lyrica!*


i was a drunk before i was a heroin addict - shit in between.


the withdrawal will kill you if you're not careful. as with all CNS depressants, when you max out your *spine* then hit the brick wall of withdrawal, it'll shock your body into seizures. i've been hospitalized twice because of this. admitted hospitalized, not that *0 fiddles, let's hang out in the emergency room b/c i'm a paranoid hypochondriac!* anxiety. neon rebound effect. i run out of pills here in...o probably hours. used to be able to sustain 36 hours cold-turkey, which was immaculate upon re-dosing; i can't get through 12 without wanting to die. which is still kind of immaculate upon redosing. if you enjoy high hits of animosity immediately following. cold-turkeying heroin is easier than this. for solid realz.


it is and forever will be my favorite drug of all time. for this very reason, i am praying to the gods of synthpop and good poetry i will be safely off of it by April or May.

Does anyone find it harder to sleep on Lyrica? I want to add 300mg to ease this ice comedown, and to potentiate the hydrocodone, oxycodone, and soma I've taken already. 


I'm not trying to sleep yet either, just be more relaxed while I'm awake

^You're just asking for a seizure with doses over 1000mg, make sure to take some benzos with a ridiculous dose like that. Make sure to wait at least a week between recreational doses, as short-term Lyrica tolerance is brutal, way worse than benzos.


Some lyrica would hit the spot right now, haven't taken any in months.

I've never done DXM (nor will I) but I don't understand how people can compare Lyrica to hallucinogens, like to ecstasy or GHB. 


To me it feels nothing like that. If anything, it's just like adding the pleasant bravado that opiates give you, minus the other opiate action like euphoria, itching, etc. 


Granted, the most I've ever taken was 1.2 grams


EDIT: So I heard they make lyrica patches somewhere in the world, sweden maybe? If so: 


Extracting the Lyrica from the patches wouldn't be too difficult. Fentanyl patches (the sandoz ones my pharmacy carries) are so easy to abuse a rock could do it. 


Could you even smoke/vape lyrica efficiently? I don't have access to the patches nor am I interested, but in the name of science? I sparingly use lyrica BTW, but am scripted 600mg per day

2nd plateau DXM is not even slightly hallucinogenic. It's hard to explain other than it felt good to be in my own.skin, in the most literal and physical sense.

I can see at higher doses what people talk about it being like a hallucinogen.


I get a feeling of the xtc kinda thing, not the same high a similar in a way but really different body feeling.


It does make colors and lights project different for me, at those higher doses.


How is everyone doing with this for their anxiety?

@emjay I wasn't talking about comparing lyrica to dxm, I was saying how people falsely compare pregabalin to MDMA, GHB, or mild dose shrooms, etc. I added the "like ecstasy" as that was primarily the hallucinogen people compare pregabalin to.


@yteek I only take these when my anxiety gets really bad, never more than once a week. I'd much rather take one of these than a benzo (due to personal history with benzos)

WOAW it has been 2y since had last time and had forgotten how fucking AWESOME this is. it has a bit of everything i like - stoned body high, ghb drunkness, some light psychedelia, and definitely  dissociation feeling that reminds strongly ketamine. The best part it lasts 16h, ridiculous half life, dont understand how  wikipedia says 5-6H halflife.

thats what I have found to be the case, any time I have tried a recreational dose (say 3-4g) I have felt very little except the fact that my daily dose wasn't working as effectively,

In my experience, you can only get some good effects by using Lyrica onces at most every 3 days. This is not usually possible, nor a good idea for most people who need the drug for pain.

wow. took 450mg along with 20mg buspar at 5pm. fell asleep at 6pm. Woke up at 7am tripping. I  forgot all about the pills, took me about 5 minutes to figure out why I was tripping. Never had that happen before. 

Was a combination of  being drunk and mdma, but no nausea or speedy feeling. I did a few blood chokes and was super intense.

edit: it's 1pm now. I took it 20hours go, still haven't come down yet. This stuff is crazy.

I am detoxing from Subs and some H and i found a bunch of Lyrica that my doc gave my years ago for siatica. Its just been laying around and I heard it's helpful with WD so I took about 450mg at 11am and OMG it hit me like a ton of bricks! No WD symptoms, so that's good. I couldn't function normally tho, walking into walls and shit like that. I dont think I will take that much again, every time I closed my eyes i got massive hallucinations....ppl were building huge geometric domes and tunneling...in my head. I just don't understand why Lyrica would take all WDs away? Will they pop up again tomorrow? If anyone has experience w/Opiate detox and Lyrica I'd love to hear about it.

Lyrica doesn't take away all of my WD but it sure helps alot! 450mg is quite a bit to take with no tolerance, I can understand why you were bumping into walls and stuff ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)

I think next time maybe 250mg? might be a better recreational dose...450mg kicked my ass. I have a fairly high tolerance to benzos and have read this can affect dosing. So I prob shouldn't take any more today, huh? I feel like shit.

I'm scripted 600mg daily, and I don't ever take that much, usually only 300mg a couple times a month.

After a month without taking Pregabalin nor Gabapentin, I did 3 150mg white Lyrica pills. It give me lots of energy and euphoria first, then I did some Xanax and Klonopin, it fucked me and I fall asleep. When I wake up I was hungry as a bear, ate some pasta, and still feel energy, empathy, cleverness, and no pain at all no matter how I sit. It's awesome.

One important thing, I did 500mg of Naproxen before taking the Lyrica to increase it binding to proteins.


I wish I could describe why and how exactly Lyrica makes me feel on a low dose of GBL. Both are downers and uppers at the same time, works on the GABA site, although no one knows if Lyrica works also on GABA-B receptors.

It's because lyrica is seen as the 21st century evolution from gabapentin. Pregabalin works very similarly on the GABA receptors but its potency is many times that of neurontin.

Neither lyrica nor neurontin agonize GABA A or B receptors.

600 mg empty stomach, dexamphetamine wearing off. CEVs -  constant images of inflated conical walls, rigid and lit up, like on a hot air baloon, waving around and I'm looking down on them from above, like a constantly shifting stage set, perspective keeps receding, patterns weaving into themselves, And what's this? 3-d purple vapour falling from the screen, Fully formed figures appear then disappear in a flash.

I seem to be a bit different to most people on here when it comes to lyrica - I'm prescribed a myriad of drugs for fibromyalgia/restless legs. Mirapex helps with that and fixes the problem - But I'm prescribed lyrica 600mg daily too - I found If I take it every day it does next to nothing and I find myself craving it more and ending up eating my entire perscription in 3 weeks, then craving it and getting mild withdrawls for the last week of the month. When I first started taking it, waiting 3 days then taking 1800mgs at once used to work, but that stopped working eventually. So I decided to change my game plan to make it worth taking. I eat my entire month stash in the first week. Then regenerate for the next 3. This means I sometimes take crazy doses - The most I have had all at the same time is 20 of the 200mg caps aka 4 grams. Even at that dose I have no adverse effects, I just feel super motivated and perfectly lucid. I'm a bit worried this may be frying an itnernal organ or two but I love it! Its my number one drug.

I've been taking Pregabalin occasionally for just over a year now, sometimes in mega doses (2100 - 3600 mg), and I recently came across this article:

[http://planetthrive.com/2009/10/neurontin-and-lyrica-are-a-death-sentence-for-new-brain-synapses/](http://planetthrive.com/2009/10/neurontin-and-lyrica-are-a-death-sentence-for-new-brain-synapses/)


My mind has felt rather dull for quite a while, and this is a very scary notion. What are your thoughts on this? It's impossible to know without actual investigation, I know, but would limiting the use of PGN to around twice a month limit the brain damage?

I have used Lyrica to comedown from speed and it worked wonderfully but I had to not have any built up tolorance to it..I am not sure if I were taking it every day it would have worked that well... I am not sure if everyone has expierances like this but my comedown from speed has always been harsh..I get major paranoia and nervousness and the lyrica made me feel AHHH just great..it soothed my nerves so well. Now granted I had to take 900mg's and even higher to get that kind of relief...

Get some Gabapentin to detox and give yourself 1-2 months to taper down. It should be painless. It's basically the same substance but much weaker and more suitable to wean yourself off with.

Beyond tolerance: No.


Quote from someone who actually isn't me: (I like swimming but not that kind)


"I have never found anything that works even REMOTELY as well... benzos work against the stimulation, but this stuff literally DELETES it. I must say, pregabalin has got to be the most useful drug of all time, at least as relates to stimulant users. Anyone who hasn't added it to their toolbox is literally missing out on a miracle drug of sorts, IMO. At least for me, pregabalin (even a low-moderate dose) will bring me down off a stimulant high within 15-20 minutes. I mean all the way to baseline, and even below if too much of the stuff is taken! It's literally like tossing water onto a fire.

This has *sort of* been documented (i.e. everyone knows it 'damps' neuronal overactivity) but I'm not sure how many people realize that it isn't damping in the normal sense of "pushing against" anxiety or overstimulation. Given the right dose, there's no overactivity there at all anymore. It's *gone*."

i've been fucking with lyrica for about 2 weeks days now. i'm high as fuck now as a matter of fact. doses of 600-1200mg, mostly around 600mg eaten and 150 snorted. often with zopiclone and sometimes with opioids.

am i going to experience awful wd's if i stop? i don't wanna get a mad tolerance 'cause that sounds shiiiiiit.

also, what with the long half life, is it building up in my system? i feel so hyper and chatty even when i'm not on it.

I got the most horrible withdrawals after using it every other day for 3 months but a few weeks isn't gonna do anything. With benzo like drugs you seem to be safe after no more than a month or so. But I wouldn't recommend getting addicted to it unless you want to know what a combined opiate/benzo withdrawal feels like.uu

This is not something I would recommend either.

If you use Lyrica for pain or anything like that I definetly wouldn't recommend trying to abuse it. I've only tried doing it a few times and I've noticed a reduction in Lyricas effectiveness afterwards - although this could just be my perception of it. Tried snorting a gram , felt alright. Wont bother again.

After my car accident -- when i was trying to get off the 300mg a day of oxycodone ER and oxycodone IR i was taking fresh out of the hospital - my doctor gave me lyrica to alleviate the pain that i was having as they took me off the opiates.   WHen i would inevitably run out of opiates mid month - lyrica almost completely attenuated the syndromes of withdrawal - it was, frankly, amazing...  Not as amazing as the suboxone i eventually got on - but very helful

Go ahead and mess around with Lyrica ,but i warn you itis a dangerous drug as dangerous as benzos.you get addicted to it and it is ADDICTIVE and you will have a wd on your hands that is nasty nasty.

I know I have taken it for 3yrs for nuero pain and its made me fat.swollen,stupid and very sick.

Its easier to come off of heroin,,so I have heard.

and mixed with benzos -well I am losing my mind.

So as long as you dont become tolerant guess you would be okay.but dont get like me,cause I am in a world of sht.

be careful ...

I've noticed quite profound mental deficites from using Lyrica as prescribed for just over a year - I already have certain learning difficultys and this sure has not made it any better. BUT it has been a God send for the allodynia in my scalp and other areas so for that I thank it. Shame about it fucking up my synapses, sperm and god knows what else.

Does anybody know a good way to dissolve lyrica? 


I tested about 1000 mg today in water and it didn't dissolve really. It kind of clumped it. 


I'm not interested in IV'ing lyrica, but I would like to figure out a way to get it prepped for IV use so I can just swallow the solution. 

I have trouble swallowing the capsules... and I don't like parachuting the powder. Any help would be appreciated.

It's freely soluble in water, but the inactive ingredients I think are what make it more like an emulsion, rather than a filtered solution.


So make sure that you filter it, For a while I would plug my 300mg caps in 1mL of water and it was so thick pre-filtration.


You could also just pour it in a drink, koolaid, etc.

It's not absolutely necessary to filter when administering a solution rectally.


However, if you plan to use any ROA besides oral, rectal, or nasal (which I've heard is not very effective) you absolutely **MUST** micron filter.

I'd say that may be from water retention...I'm not sure though.


I got it too, I just take it once in a blue moon to kick back...similar to a glass of wine or a valium...typical gaba like effects with a unique twist...its a very mellow but weird drug.

Pregaballin' foe life.


300mg puts me where I like to be pretty much at the moment, I have been enjoying them whilst on bupe wd and have been taking as low doses as possible since I try to be as not-high as I can rly. 


Yesterday I took 150mg with 2,5mg of nitrazepam and was pretty surprised.. Positively.

I have a question about how fast can Lyrica withdrawals get to you? I'm currently taking Lyrica since Monday, and have been doing so by skipping days. Monday I took 600mg, Tuesday no Lyrica, Today (Wednesday) again took 600mg. So, I am taking it every other day to numb my Methadone withdrawal. I don't want to take it everyday because I'm afraid of the withdrawals after. I plan on going on Lyrica for atleast a month more by skipping days, but soon when the withdrawals from Methadone go mild I'll lower the dose to 300mg.


So, will I be having w/ds from this regime after 1 month of use? When I stop Lyrica I'm still going to take Clonazepam daily, could it numb the possible w/ds since it's also a GABA receptor substance (I may be wrong here)?

question to a bluelighter, i couldve sworn i read something confirming pregabalin indirectly agonized the ghb receptor.. that also explained its odd combination of both stimulant and depressant effects

think it mightve been that it enhances gaba, and in turn that binds to the ghb receptor but again i cant find any information confirming or denying this and i was curious as to if anyone could help enlighten me one if not both questions

^Both Pregabalin (Lyrica) and Gabapentin (Nuerontin) have still unknown exact mechanisms of action. Pfizer, the manufacturer of Lyrica, states this on their website; they also say that it reduces levels of "substance P" and glutamate, as well as stabilizing norepinepherine levels without re-uptake inhibition. I can just about guarantee by its effect that it has a positive GABAergic effect. As a first thought I'd say its certainly possible that it somehow increases levels of GHB, but there are chemists on bluelight with more fundamental knowledge than I; if you don't get a response then I'd recommend posting in ADD. I saw your post here: [http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/511723-Lyrica-s-Mechanism-of-Action](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/511723-Lyrica-s-Mechanism-of-Action). Just curious, why are you interested? Sorry I can't give you a specific answer. Many people do find it actually stimulating at high doses, with a characteristic "ecstasy" or "GHB" feeling, but I'm sure you know this is reductive. I've personally never had Pregabalin, but the Gabapentin I tried was sure an intense drug.


Peace

Lyrica has been my savior now when going through benzo withdrawal. I've used Lyrica a few years ago at 600mg/day for GAD and benzo withrawal. Back then I failed my benzo WD and instead got addicted to pregabalin too. However WD from Lyrica isn't that bad and tapering down from 600mg/day was quite painless and took a few months. Now though I'm determined to go through with my benzo WD and there's no way I could do it without Lyrica (and beta blockers).


It's great fun when used recreationally too, but I have gained a huge tolerance to GABAergics and have to take 1000+ mg Lyrica to have fun. About a month ago I ended up taking almost 4 grams in one day/night, which is my highest dose ever by far. I did add 15 mg Noopept which could have contributed to the ridiculous dose as Noopept made me feel almost sober at first.

Start with 150 mg. It may take up to 3 hours before you feel the effects, although usually I feel it in 1-2 hours. So don't re-dose too soon thinking it doesn't work. Pregabalin has a very high safety profile but combined with alcohol it can get extremely intoxicating fast as they potentiate each other. The same thing with benzos. Alcohol with high doses of Lyrica tends to make me very nauseous too.

im interested because im prescribed it off topic for anxiety and it has the traditional cns depressant effects, but a paradoxal stimulant effect not resembling a weak mdma-ish(esk) effect

Started with 100mgs 1st day, strange come-up -never thought there even is one with Lyrica but it was there (and reminded me a bit of taking low-dosed Dextrometorphan-, but not much effects at all after the initial bodyload.


Two days later i took 200mgs in the evening, i think i was a lil' bit more sleepy and calm, but that was it. 


Well then, today i thought "fuck it" and took 300mgs in the morning. Both times i had no bodyload like the 1st time i took it, but with 300mgs i had a somewhat strange headspace - i was mostly stimulated and noticeable clumsy, but i felt no euphoria or mood-lift at all, just a very weak feeling of well-being/calmness.


So, that's Lyrica?

Well, a few days ago i tried 400mgs which were almost exactly as disappointing as the 300mgs i mentioned in the previous post. I of course felt something psychoactive going on, but it was just not pleasurable.


Any recommendations? Should i try taking lower doses for some prolonged time or do i have to take more?

Try what you want. For some people Pregabalin is highly recreational and for others they can hardly tell the difference beyond relief of physical discomfort.

I've took lyrica for two years and I don't understand people gettin high from them. This is one med that I have took a lot of even more that 900 ml but never have got a feeling of being high just kinda get wobbly and can't think straight that I hope isn't someone idea of high. You could just spin to fast on a Mary go round and jump offi and get that feeling for free.

I started taking this a couple of days ago, for nerve damage in my leg causing weird sensations. I was on gabapentin before (for a couple of weeks), but this didn't really do anything except make me dizzy, tired and gave me vivid (sometimes sexual) nightmares. 


Seems to be doing the job (impressed that it worked so quickly...!).


Is this ok when combined with MDMA? 

Doctor said it might make alcohol a bit stronger, but I didn't ask about anything else ![:-)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

You're missing the point. The findings come from a study done at Stanford University, not people trying to sell supplements. The study has nothing to do with supplements.


Abstract:


> Synapses are asymmetric cellular adhesions that are critical for nervous system development and function, but the mechanisms that induce their formation are not well understood. We have previously identified thrombospondin as an astrocyte-secreted protein that promotes central nervous system (CNS) synaptogenesis. Here, we identify the neuronal thrombospondin receptor involved in CNS synapse formation as α2δ-1, the receptor for the anti-epileptic and analgesic drug gabapentin. We show that the VWF-A domain of α2δ-1 interacts with the epidermal growth factor-like repeats common to all thrombospondins. α2δ-1 overexpression increases synaptogenesis in vitro and in vivo and is required postsynaptically for thrombospondin- and astrocyte-induced synapse formation in vitro. Gabapentin antagonizes thrombospondin binding to α2δ-1 and powerfully inhibits excitatory synapse formation in vitro and in vivo. These findings identify α2δ-1 as a receptor involved in excitatory synapse formation and suggest that gabapentin may function therapeutically by blocking new synapse formation.

I think people should pay attention to this. It may not be of much concern to people only using the drug occasionally, but daily users might be in trouble if having the drug constantly in their system is reducing the CNS's ability to form new synapses. This could explain why many long-term daily users report a mind-numbing effect and memory issues.

Well, took this one again after a while now a few days ago, 100mg in the morning on an empty stomach, and it was really nice! I was very introspective, chatty and sociable while also more open and calm.


It was probably because i was too much into opiates/opioids as i tried it the 1st few times and didn't really felt the effects at all...seemed like they're muted down to almost nothing.


Bad thing, i don't get much salvation off my nerve pain/paresthesia, at least not that much as with opiates/opioids.

I get moodlifting effects from Lyrica as well. I asked my doc for it when I kicked a heavy alcohol habit. I started at 3x 75mg per day and it helped wonders for my mood and allowed me to take less benzos for the withdrawal. Two months later now and I'm taking 3x 225mg, sometimes more (up to 800 or 900mg total in a day). Most of the euphoria is gone now, although it is still anxiolytic.


I'm thinking of taking a tolerance break. Right now I need 600mg for a nice effect (two months ago I needed 200mg and have used it daily since). How long of a break should I take to go down to about 300mg per dose?

Lyrica is practically the same thing as Neurotin just a different strength per mg dose and a different stereo-isomer of gabatein. It acts uppon your GABA receptors igniting them, it's a very nice combination with Amphetamines, D-AMP, D/L-AMP, D-METHAMP,D/L-METHAMP.. It is practically harmless, the amphetamines unfortunately aren't harmless.. I am sure you know... But any benzo or GABA activating drug is almost a common thing to be RX'ed with amphetamines..

(erase your inbox so i can respond to u ^^)


but yeah lyrica is nice with amphetamines, i was rxed 2000mg gabapentin way long ago on my old adderall when i was like 19... lyrica feels better and you need less...


theyre coming out with a new analogue of pregabalin i read on wikipedia... pfizer is supposedly for insomnia for when they lose the patent... if this is true or not, idk but that would be badass.... i want to switch from my valium to make it as needed, and use lyrica if my dr would let me, but he says its not as good as diazepam, no shit, but i don't want to be on diazepam daily... lol... i do, but thats not good for dependency issues...


600mg pregabalin is what i used for mood lfting effects, empty stomach with carbonated beverage...

yes...


i was thinking of both too.. there will be a ton of these someday...


pfizers drugs neurontin and lyrica are (or were in neurontins case, tho its still common), name brand or generic for neurontin, two of the most common rx drugs... especially with all the off label uses...


id love to get lyrica prescribed... 450-600mg twice a day.. then i can knock off the sonata, and keep my newly raised dosage valium to as needed... he just raised the dose tonight to 20mg twice a day... i cant be dooooinn that lol...    because i can make 40mg a day last all month and id be fucked on dependency


not to say lyrica and the like isn't a cause of physical dependency but its not as risky...


kinda went off there on a little thing........

getting 100 grams of that atagablin i am quite excited to see it doses are around 150mg in trials. I suggested the 4 methyl pregablin first but heard the isomer is hard to isolate and atagablin was easier to make its going to be an exciting compound

Hi there,


Apologies if this question has been asked before; you know how it is, tens of pages are a struggle to read through, especially after a nice dose of Lyrica.


I'm currently prescribed 400 mg a day, to be taken db; previously I was on 300mg db, which i would take all at once in the morning, and feel freaking great - total peace of mind, motivation, finding things pleasurable...well you know the effects, i need not go on.


Went to collect my meds this morning, and after a short browse of this thread decided to take 600 mg - 450 oral, 150 plugged (noticed no difference plugging...i think oral, on an empty stomach, is the way to go).  I've also had one can of 9% lager -  4.5 units, and am feeling pretty darn good....like a benzo high mixed with a bit of opiate noddiness.  A bit of verbal (and written) diorrhea as well - anyone else notice they can't shut up when taking these things?


Anyhow, the real question I wanted to ask was with regards to smoking (tobacco) with pregabalin.  I searched PubMed, and could only find a report stating that pregabalin was useful in smoking cessation.  I'm currently a benzo addict on a taper (which is hell at times), and know that tobacco decreases the blood concentration of many benzos, especially alprazolam.  Have any smokers who take 'recreational' doses of pregabalin noticed any effect on it's potency?  At a guess I'd say it had little effect, due to pregabalin's very bizarre mechanism of action.  I just smoked a pipe (pipe smoker here), and the first few puffs were pure euphoria.


Any more knowledgable bluelighters have information regarding tobacco and pregabalin?


Thanks, Tom

I took gabapentin for a day I had a reaction to it but when I was on out it made me care less about smoking. I had no urges to smoke. This may not really answer your question but it does seem to mess with the pleasure centers of the brain or nicotine receptors in dome way.

Really, I started out with 600 mgs, but preferred using 1500 when I was using it (or 3000). The dosage makes all the difference. Also tolerance and stomach content, and it doesn't work two consecutive days. 300 mgs is a good anti-depressant.

Tell me more about this dosage thing? What's the difference between, let's say 1500 and 300? But 3000 (!), isn't that a bit crazy? How does that feel?

i've taken that dose over the course of the day. your tolerance to this stuff really grows incredibly quick. today i plugged 2100mgs, to see if it would maybe kick in faster since i hate how long it takes for the effects to take hold, and can safely say that plugging pregabalin in a waste of drugs.

The website has decided to interpret this as an indication that AED's can reduce brain plasticity by reducing thrombospondin binding. In reality, this may not be the case and a reduction in binding may not be associated with any noticeable effects. Note that thrombospondin is involved in the creation of novel connections and **for someone who is well into adulthood, this may not be as detrimental as it would be in a younger individual.** I would like to see this topic assessed with a validated cognitive functioning measure, which would be more definitive than  the study you have cited.

I know this is conjecture at this point, but what about for someone who is in adulthood (mid to late twenties) but is in graduate school where continual learning of new information is required? Do you think Lyrica, or AEDs (was not even aware that Lyrica counted as an AED, but I guess it does work on glutamate, like Lamictal), at a moderate therapeutic dose of 150 mg 2x a day, would interfere with the learning process?


I suppose anecdotal evidence might be more useful at this point. Anyone in a rigorous grad program and taking Lyrica? Have you noticed any effects?

in my opinion this is all supreme bullshit, not that i would put it past pfizer or any other pharma company to sell something straight up poisonous (see thalidomide) but i highly doubt that that research is accurate.

Its impossible to say without trying, though is quite likely at least on a subtle level.

A lot of users of pregabalin and gabapentin claim to have noticed a "mind-numbing" or "brain-fogging" effect from taking it as prescribed. I don't take PGN every day, and I haven't really noticed a detriment from taking it 2-4 times per month at high doses. But gabapentin has been dubbed morontin by some users, and there's your anecdotal evidence.


I wouldn't recommend taking it every day unless you absolutely need it to function (for pain). I wouldn't recommend taking it at all for anxiety, because it isn't a solution. It's like drinking ethanol for anxiety. Why treat the symptoms instead of the cause?

General consesus seems to be: Yes, faster onset than normal (15 min until effect), same potency.


It's a lot of powder to snort (soft on the nose though), depending on what type of capsules you have. 


The effects last shorter when snorted, in my experience. It feels different too, less relaxing (?). I've seen some other user on bluelight compare snorted Lyrica to "a bad speed buzz" or some such.


fwiw, I prefer to drop the capsules on an empty stomach, onset is almost as quick as snorting and the effect lasts longer.

I often see 600mg mentioned as an upper-limit dose p/day.


Can I read more about the negative effects that appear above this limit (for example, 2x 600mg daily)? "Megathread" is chaotic and hard to search thru, can someone point me to medical or anecdotal reports or such?


I'm taking Lyrica daily for two months now, and went up from 2x 150mg per day to 1x 600 or 2x 450mg. I'm thinking about either increasing my dose, or having a tolerance break.

I've taken doses as high as 3600 mg. In my experience, after you reach around 2100 mg, there is a bit of a ceiling. At that point, you probably won't feel a difference if you re-dose. But it probably isn't necessary to even take that much. 1200-1500 mg is enough for me, and even less works well in combination with other CNS depressants (I'm talking like 600-900 mg).

How do you treat the cause of physical anxiety without drugs? Not everyone experiences anxiety as rumination. I don't excessively worry about things, I just feel physically uncomfortable all day. There's no talk therapy that's going to verbalize that away.

I'm not a psychologist or a psychiatrist, but I'll still give this question a try. First of all, what is physical anxiety? Is it an entirely separate problem from "mental anxiety"? If so, where does it come from? Why would the body be creating symptoms of anxiety without any influence from the brain/mind? I think that the mind/body link says that there must be some connection, even if you experience anxiety primarily as physical symptoms and not thoughts. I think it is much more common for at least *some* level of thought to accompany physical anxiety, but I'm not saying I don't believe you. Did you, at any point, have "mental" symptoms of anxiety? I wonder if there could be some kind of subconscious notion influencing the anxiety. That's a difficult area to comment on for a non-psychologist.


I still think that CBT can help people with "physical anxiety", and here's why: Even if you're not having anxious thoughts now, if you had positive and relaxing/reassuring thoughts (do you have these already?) then I'd imagine that those thoughts would result in a decrease in your physical symptoms, especially if you actually *believed* in those thoughts. Maybe not, but it does make sense if thought can influence how you feel (and that has been proven).


Drugs are very effective at stopping the physical symptoms of anxiety. But tolerance develops to everything eventually, downregulation happens and there are other side effects. My psychiatrist always asks me if the "side effects" of the anxiety are worse than the side effects from the drug, and I think he has an excellent point. Some people may be better off on a medication, but if they're going that route, perhaps they should be on some kind of rotation of substances in order to prevent tolerance and dependence. An antidepressant might also be more worthwhile than a drug that offers immediate relief. There is a reason why benzodiazepines are not recommended to be prescribed for the long-term. And pregabalin isn't any better, in my opinion.


I don't know, these are hard questions to answer. I personally would not take any drug that can also be used recreationally (gabaergics) daily, but that's because in my opinion it's not that far off from taking ethanol every day for anxiety.

I can't comment on the first part of your post, but I can about whether or not if affects focus and your ability to think clearly. For me, the acute effects of pregabalin do slightly limit my ability to think effectively, and it slows down my processing speed. I wouldn't go to school on pregabalin if I had to take an exam or something like that, because it also effects my memory when I'm on it. I also wouldn't care as much, because it's quite euphoric for me. I haven't taken PGN for more than four consecutive days, so I'm not sure what it would be like in chronic administration. But quite a few users report cognitive detriment from using it as prescribed. I think the only way to know for sure is to try it out for yourself, you should be able to tell if it's going to work out or not after being on it for two weeks (but that may be dose dependant). Good luck!

I have been taking pregaplin for almost a year now, along with Diclofenac, amitriptyline, and oxycodone. I was shot in the back during my time in Iraq by a 7.62x39mm round from a AK-47. It never penetrated as it skimmed off my back sappy plate, but the force of the impact crushed my L4/L5 vertebrae. I am to have my first "major" surgery in a few weeks to repair the damage that was done over a year ago. 


Anyways I usually never run out of oxycodone, or my diclofenac, but i do tend to take more of the pregaplin than prescribed as it seams to help take away the nerve pain better than the oxy and diclofenac. The withdrawls are painful if you run out of lyrica. Not so much mentally, but physically you experience two-fold the nerve pain you had prior to taking it. I recommend to NEVER run of of this stuff, especially if you have been taking it non-stop for over a long period of time. Weening yourself down would be my recommendation. I have taken so much lyrica in one day it would prolly put down an elephant, just to get me thru another day. Thank god that most of you will never have to go through what I am experiencing. Suicide has crossed my mind just to excape the agony of nerve pain!


Amen to whomever discovered this drug! Its one of those "miracle drugs" IMOP. Its treats pain, anxiety, sleep, ect...

^ Great first post, man, welcome to Bluelight! ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) Thanks for your service.


I agree, Lyrica is the best medication for neuropathic pain. Only muscoskeletal pain is treated with opioids (Lyrica does very little for non-neuropathic-joint-pain), but opioids do next to nothing for neuropathy, which tends to make opioid addicts keep raising their doses higher and higher in Pain Management, since it's not helping, instead of trying legitimate adjuncts like Gabapentin/Pregabalin, the gold standards for neuropathy.


Hell, even L-Theanine (similar to pregs/gabapentin) works better for neuropathy versus opioids.

Lyrica is the tits though tolerance grows super fast to euphoric effects. I've been taking it for a while and it is still one of the best anxiolytics I have tried. Results are rapid and don't take accumulation of the drug in the blood stream. I took 300mgs this morning along with my suboxone and I'm in a good mood ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Is redosing worth it? I have a bunch of these laying around. I just took 150mg about 1:15 ago and not really feeling anything. Should I eat a few more or is it too late?


I take .5mg Xanax daily for about 2.5 years now. I am also on 10mg vicodin a day for my back. I don't really feel the other two drugs because I use therapeutic doses for those two.

it can take more than 1:15 hr to kick in for me. especially on a full stomach it can take two hours before first signs. only on an empty stomach and a fired-up metabolism i'll get a 1-hour onset.


redosing works okay for me, up to a certain point. staggering 600mg by having it in four doses, hours apart, is much less impressive than having it in one or two doses. some people don't like the (different type of) high that redosing gives, i think it has its own time and place.

Ya i didnt redose. it was on an empty stomach and i didnt feel the slightest buzz. maybe due to my long term Xanax use? i tried 300mg today. We will see how that goes.


EDIT


t+4hrs - feeling a slight buzz resembling what xanax used to feel like until i had a tolerance but thats about it. i even took my normal 10mg vicodin and 1mg xanax.


Well, I have 675mg left....guess i should wait a week or so and drop it all at once? I was gonna go to 450, but not really worth keeping 3 of them unless i give them to my wife with no tolerance or benzo/alcohol abuse. I keep seeing this "ecstacy sedation" described but I have not felt anything close to this. I read somewhere that 600mg is the seizure threshold and I really don't go above those on anything so maybe ill just drop 600mg and give one to the wife...maybe she will feel 1 lol...Any recommendations?

I find pregabalin to be brilliant receationaly personaly.I would take 1200 mg twice a day for 6 months and feel drunk very talkative chat to anyone and everyone.The only slight problem is my loss off balance but i find that fun also most of the time.But for people new to the substance start ofat low doses and build up be cool!!!!

I've been curious as to when withdrawal kicks in, I go 1 day on and 2 days off and never feel anything on days off but always here these horrible wd stories. If your feeling very mild wd off missing 1 day and use it continually at 600mg daily I'd imagine it may creep up on you sooner than later. I guess we can wait for an answer together.

I took my first dose of pregabalin the other day at 100 mg. It was, to say the least, pleasant and not so subtle. I had a bit of buprenorphine the night prior to dosing the pregabalin, and it was my first time with buprenorphine, too, but even though I noticed the bupe still working through the day, maybe a little over an hour or so after I popped the 100 mg of pregabalin, I was feeling really different and actually quite "high". It was what I'd imagine a short-acting barbiturate might be like, but with a slight tripped-out, spacey feeling to it, but REALLY anxiolytic with the bupe, in combination. It actually gave me a decent "jelly" feel, and a bouncy feel, too. It made me a little lightheaded, I'd say, and caused a bit of astasia-abasia, but it was great. I do take tramadol, benzos, and amphetamines every day, though, so all of those, with the bupe, probably led to this synergy, but it was like a nice, kind, non-overwhelming DXM-(benzo for the first time) kind of feel. It was quite sedating, and I would even say euphoric. I am going to enjoy this more now that I know, but the thing is I am reading it loses its magic quickly and such, so maybe I'll save it for special occasions or maybe for the odd time I need something other than a benzo or more tramadol to relax for therapeutic, and not just recreational, purposes. Or, maybe, I'll save it for when I use more bupe, having finished the ~ 1.5 - 2 mg section of a strip a few hours ago, this being the third night to make use of it due to a low opioid tolerance. Also, a surprisingly nice drug, just a bit more sedating than I thought it would be, but that makes sense thinking on it.

I have Fibromyalgia and scoliosis and osteoarthritus and just biding my time to go back to pain specialist to get more nerves burned in my neck and back.


I have been taking lyrica for 3 years. I take between 150 - 200 mg depending how severe the pain is but I am also taking topamax, arcoxia for pain. I have tramadol but it justs makes me sleepy and my skin itchy as hell so I avoid like the plague.


I can't take Codeine or morphine.


The topamax and lyrica are also been used as mood stabilisers as well as rivotril, Xanax, and epilim.


I can't say that they are great as I still need to take ibuprofen and paracetamol together to help with pain management.


Not sure if I want to stay on it, but it's always the withdrawals that a killer and tend to put you off!!!![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)

I've been on this since march and have gained over 20 pounds. It doesn't help much (if at all) with pain and I've never had any withdrawals whatsoever. I had been taking norcos prior to this but my pain doc was "asked to retire" so I had to start all over. After suffering through a few worthless pain meds e.g. Nucynta, I now have a low dose fent patch and one norco a day. Lyrica really packed the pounds on! Grrrrrrr!

Am I alone in having thought at first that this drug was the one I'd been waiting for: absolutely killed my anxiety in a way that felt similar to the opiate anti-anxiolytic effect; relaxation and immunity to problems better than any benzo; able to socialise with absolute ease for the first time in years which made me feel positively euphoric - in short, a miracle drug - only to find that within weeks tolerance developed to the point where none of these effects were felt, and I was left feeling utterly devastated.


No tolerance increase brought back these feelings of wanting to grasp life by the balls.  Genuinely devastated.  Ah well.  


Handy for stim comedowns.

Hi, no you are not alone in your thoughts that lyrica is a miracle drug as this stuff completely removed benzo withdrawals for me, but aside from that effect i still take a little benzo and it gets greatly potentiated so 50 mg oxazepam get me wasted like would i take 300 mg oxazepam without lyrica, but better not to copy behaviour like this as you can OD using lyrica combined with another CNS depressant like especially methadone has to be warned for.

What i mean is not to take lyrica together with methadone if you do not know what you can expect before so when you know that i am at 160 mg methadone a day, now and then i add 300 mg seroquel, the 900 mg pregabalin and the benzo so quite a bite all this stuff and i repeat dont copy this behaviour it can  kill you i hope that is clear enough.

Important with pregabalin is that you should respect this drug and not to dose according to tolerance development else before you know it you will need 3 grams of lyrica a day and feel normal only so best would be to use this stuff about three times a week, but i cant do this so i do take my daily prescribed 900 mg and feel good with this amount as aside from helping benzo withdrawals pregabalin also has an effect on depression, which works better for me then any known SSRI, SNRI, NassA etcetera.

I tried to reply before, but everytime my words vanished so i leave this one short as i think i will lose my words again ffs It worked this time so i am editing my reply a little bit to make clear what i like to say. 

Like mentioned lyrica has anti depressant properties, but i take my 900 mg in one go whereas i could imagine that its better to dose twice or even three times a day only since i used 3 grams of lyrica myself and realized what kind of madness that was made me stop it first then some days later i started the 900 mg dose and i felt as good as i did when i started using pregabalin. The same 900 initally euphoric mg's currently just keep me feeling well enough, but for the third time here do not copy and do not forget the rather insane doses i used to use not only from the lyrica its more the combo methadone/benzo/lyrica all in high doses whom i fear for other people without the tolerance to do so, be warned and think first, thanks.

Regards moi.

Freek, what kind of side effect did you experience at 3000mg per day? And what kind of side effects at 900mg per day?


Since last week I went up from 600mg to 850-1000mg per day. I am worried about side effects because 600mg is often found as the "maximum daily dosage". 

I want to continue with daily use, because it works better for me than regular antidepressants and it also removes the need to take benzo's (or other sedatives). Usually I wait 4 or 5 hours between doses (three doses a day).

1g + is way too much lyrica IMO.... paradoxical effects start to occur, and it loses therapeutic value..


i usually stay at 900 and below if i want to have fun, but for anxiolysis, i take 300-600mgs and it works like a charm potentiating suboxone and is really great for anxiety

DO you guys find that when you take like 1000mg of prgabalin you get a nice buzz for 2-3 hours but then you get a crash where you feel dysphoirc and anxious.

Sometimes i have to take like 4 zopiclone to calm me down!!!  Is this normal???

Re: DJMaux's question:


This was normal for me during the first few weeks of treatment on this drug.  I would take the dose in the morning and feel fantastic up until early evening, when my mood would drop severely.  I'd definitely describe this as a come down, but in contrast to stimulant come downs the sense of depression strongly outweighed the sense of anxiety, although the latter was still definitely present.  This feeling will go away with time however.  But then again so will the euphoric feelings.  Personally, although I wouldn't recommend anyone follow this advice in the interests of harm reduction, if I was to use Pregabalin recreationally, I would make sure I had a fair few benzos and some alcohol present to knock me out before the crash hit.  


It's funny how quickly this drug is gaining in popularity.   I wonder if the increase in interest amongst recreational users is in part due to an increase in prescriptions of Pregabalin, after it was licensed for use in psychiatric disorders which was, in the UK at least, only fairly recently?

I find that I need 3x 300mg per day instead of my prescribed 2x 300mg, because two doses per day don't last long enough and leave jittery "rebound" effects in between. 


My doctor reluctant to prescribe more than 600mg per day because "it will be toxic, hard on the liver", but he couldn't tell me more than that. Why was the 600mg threshold set? And what is known about negative effects when going above that daily?

I am not sure to be honest, I don't even know how much we really know about the toxic effects of Lyrica.  You might find that Lyrica works similiarly to Gabapentin in that staggering your doses and maybe drinking WGFJ will increase any effects you are looking for.

Not sure about toxicity, but IME, it fucks with your sense of balance above ~550-600mg p/day.  That sucks, your walking into walls n shit, fucking retarded man, it can't be good if you can't even walk straight...

Hi, side effects from a higher dose then 600 mg will probably not even be there when on 600 mg you have no side effects and you only like to add 300 mg. 

Maybe a little bit of side effects like a little blurry vision, dizyness, balance issues, but those side effects were present in the beginning and in about 3 weeks i would say side effects stopped from occurring while the benefical effect still continues at 900 mg a day.

900 instead of 600 mg in three doses of each 300 mg is not really more dangerous then taking twice daily 300 mg, but if you never messed with higher doses above those 900 mg then i think adding those extra 300 mg´s could actually make you feel good and when you do try not to get tempted and use more then 900 mg else if you would take say 1.5 gram a few times then the 900 mg could stop working, but alright you wont take more.


Toxic effects frm pregabalin hmmm i cant say i had any when i took 3 grams a day, but strangely enough as lyrica is an anti epilepticus med if you take too much then you can get violent seizures, but other toxic side effects i have no idea and my guess is that lyrica would only show to be toxic in very high doses like 5 grams plus.

I said it before, but i mention it again so what i mean is that lyrica combined with cannabis delivers a very nice effect without having to fear that this combo could OD you, but combining lyrica with other CNS depressants should only be done under doctor´s advise a problem though is that many of us as patients know more from medications required then a doctor, but they severely dislike it if for example i ask for this and that med once a doctor said to me the office is not a supermarket where you can order what you like, sure doctor i said and i took off with ten days worth of rohypnol stuff i only could get by asking for flunitrazepam in the hope that the doc doesn´t know the word and with the ten days worth of rohypnol the doc didn´t know so i was lucky.


In the beginning when i started lyrica i had these balance issues, dizyness, walking into walls stuff like that, but lyrica felt that good that those side effects were taken for granted and in about three weeks i was at 3 grams a day, but without side effects and also without desired effect so when i dose daily as prescribed makes me on the long run feeling much better then to keep taking lyrica in very high amounts to feel it again only that didn´t happen so i forced myself down to 900 mg, which was easy enough without dependence yet. From there i kept taking the 900 mg and am anxious and depression free so take it as prescribed, but also say something if it doesn´t work well enough atfirst so that the dose can be upped provided you tolerate the higher dose and being able to tolerate side effects made 600 mg te highest prescribed dose as most people wont get more benefit from a higher dose just not everybody like myself and the above poster who likes to start 900 mg daily.

I think that the upperlimit in mg´s with lyrica is at 1200 mg a day(the max therapeuthic dose that would be not max recreational), but that means 600 mg is not enough still that will stay the max recommended dose with most people saying they already cant take 150 mg due to the side effects according to the shrink i see. Well until here.

Regards, Freek.

Perhaps the trials done with Pregabalin for GAD showed that dosages above 600mg were not really any more effective than 600mg/day for treatment of symptoms of anxiety?  Or that 600mg/day was seen to be an optimum dose when balancing desired effects against side effects.  Just a thought.


Anyway, I've been reducing my daily dose from 600mg to 200-400mg, in the hope that I'll be able to more easily enjoy occasional recreational use of this drug again.  I've not yet tried going a whole day without any Pregabalin yet, but can report that dropping down a few hundred mg over a week hasn't caused me any obvious WD.  This is after about 4 months of daily use.

Some might say im a dirty b*****d drinking urine after taking pregabalin but if i take say 1000mg and then over the next few hours drink my urine (which has 90% of unchanged pregabalin) i get a buzz that lasts a lot longer.

Ok so drinking urine is horrible it makes you want to barf BUT if you get some STRONG fruit juice or cordial (I used welshes purple grape juice with a little water) then when you pee in the galss of cordial and drink it you honestly cant taste the urine at all!!

Its like theres no pee in it.

Any way just my thoughts on how to drink urine without wanting to puke up ! lol

Do you take your dose all at once, or spread out over the day? I spread it out and when lowering my tolerance I find it easier to skip an evening dose than an earlier dose.

Hi All, the withdrawal from lyrica well to start with if you like to know IF lyrica gives you withdrawals, in most cases it wont, then just skip a day not only a dose just a day then chances are high that more then a little insomnia will not be experienced.

Now for people with anxiety issues who take lyrica, and who get anxiety relief from lyrica, then for those people withdrawals in the form of heightened anxiety can be expected much faster then compared to somebody who takes lyrica without having anxiety issues. This could be slightly compared with a benzo WD, but a lyrica withdrawal can be bad just never as bad as a benzo WD can get, so whomever who started using a benzo for anxiety relief then this relief will be had and when the benzo will be stopped before its even remotely possible that dependence occurred then anxiety levels will go up and this feeling can be mistaked with a benzo withdrawal.


To become benzo dependent taking a benzo for a month wont make that happen beware for the high potency benzo's though, alprazolam and clonazepam especially, but behind say three months some dependency can be expected and if desired taper your benzo from there then when it comes to lyrica withdrawals i take this stuff already for a year or so, but if i stop it a day here or a day there trying to get the initial effect again then i dont feel bad from lack of lyrica.

At the same time i read about people who do lyrica for a few months and report bad withdrawals comparable with benzo's, but where lyrica can fully cover for a benzo WD this does not work the other way around in the same strength still a benzo can help possible lyrica withdrawals and what also helps are anti histaminics for a better sleep like somecan be had OTC in the US.


Lyrica is not approved for GAD in the US, but more doctors recognize this effect and write for pregabalin as pregabalin can be very effective for anxiety problems just not for everybody. If you think you could use lyrica ask your psychiatrist or your MD its a schedule 5 med so it cant be too hard to get it.


What's more ah the question if lyrica is taken once daily or multiple times a day, but i take it once daily in the prescribed 900 mg and its my opinion that if you take more doses a day that this could speed up the time needed to take lyrica before you could experience withdrawals. I do hope that i am wrong with that assumption though.


Talkative and social anxiety gone yeah that is the effect what you can get if you take lyrica say two times a week maybe three times are possible without becoming dependent, but twice weekly is not enough to become dependent from lyrica and taking it in that low frequency leaves lyrica's recreational potential at an optimal level. After becoming dependent and recreational became history then taking no lyrica for 3-4 days and by day five chances are high that it makes you feel very good again whereas for most people who take lyrica daily this med also has an anti depressant effect, atleast for me it does.


I dont have GAD, but i could imagine myself a strong effect against this badness from using lyrica based on how the substance influences myself, which is rather subtle after i dont know howlong taking the 900 mg daily, but what i like to smoke after about three hours when lyrica acts for me that would be cannabis and this combo is just very good when you like a four hour plus cannabis effect.

Lyrica also potentiates substances and then especially substances who work on te CNS like benzo's, anti psychotics, opiates, amphetamines and methadone being an opiate ofcourse, but i like to say it a few times not to combine lyrica with methadone for it's danger, and so combined use of lyrica and other CNS depressants will often result in excessive sedation so if you have a certain combo of meds and lyrica is desired then if it can be had find out first how it reacts, in a low dose, with the other meds.


WTF drinking urine for it's pregabalin content damn some people really go far, but doing this is not completely insane, because pregabalin will be excreted unchanged, but it has a 6 hour halflifetime so for example when you took 600 mg then 6 hours later roughly 300 mg is in your urine and so on so if you dont get lyrica prescribed having no lyrica left then it makes sense to drink urine after using this med, but i certainly dont recommend this.


Lyrica is not similar to benzo's and it's effect can be reproduced every day again, but lyrica has this tendency to 'poop out' after a while using it with success and that sucks so the only thing i can think of when this happens is to stop taking lyrica for atleast a week and start it up after that week again then your chances for a good effect again are present, but in general try to keep your dose as low as possible needed for a desired effect then when tolerance does knock at your door there is some room to up the dose to a max amount of 1,200 mg a day, prescribed that is.

Using a benzo together with lyrica is something you have to be careful with, because lyrica strongly potentiates benzo's so in case you have a benzo without getting much relief at te prescribed dose then adding lyrica can be quite benefical, but do not use lyrica with the intention to potentiate benzo's and/or other CNS meds. If you are used to taking say 5 mg diazepam three times a day then with lyrica once daily the diazepam would show to be sufficient, dont forget this.

Lyrica does work for certain people in higher then 600 mg a day doses so it could be worth it to see how 900 mg do if 600 mg were not very impressive. Something what also should be taken in account if lyrica is used together with other CNS depressants like in my case methadone and seroquel then if the lyrica goes you will also lose it's potentiating effect so its possible that a methadone dose taken before combined with lyrica will act a lot less strong without the lyrica, this is not the same as withdrawals. So far i wonder what happens when i hit 'post quick reply'.

Regards, Freek.   ouchh that's half a book i wrote, excuse me.

yes, lyrica can cause some memory loss and some sedation, but no where near the memory loss caused by benzos.  if i were to compare pregabalin to a benzo, i would say alprazolam or lorazepam, but more close to xanax.  the anxiolysis efficacy of lyrica is similar to alprazolam..but lyrica has the talk-a-tiveness effect that i love.

This talkative effect like you call it i know what you mean, but lyrica never worked like that for me. I suppose that the use of other substances with lyrica prevents such a feeling of being talkative when usually you aren't the same applies to me, but if you like the effect try to stick to twice weekly lyrica in the same dose, do not up the dose all the time, good luck.

I'm having a very hard time sleeping at night due to suffering from 40% burns on my body.  My legs were burned bad and I have nerve damage.  I would lay in bed and have restless legs so bad I wanted to climb the walls.  I didn't get any sleep for days.  It would even cause me problems during the day if I was sitting for a extended time.  So, I tried Lyrica and was amazed by the success.  I took 650mg at first and had a wonderful buzz for a few hours, then passed out.  It took my roommate 15 minutes to wake me up after 4 hours of deep sleep.  Freaked my roommate out, he thought I was dead...LOL.  Woke up groggy for a few minutes and ran into a few walls but after coffee I was on point.  I felt GREAT for a good 6 more hours after I woke up.  I had a dr. appt that day and I was so chatty to the nurses and joked with them.  I had an amazing time!  My anxiety was gone and I felt like I had no worries. I even convinced my dr. to prescribe Klonopin.  Lyrica and Klonopin made a great combo today.  Highly recommended!  Love Lyrica

Yes Ninae I did just that,thank you ,I weaned off of lyrica but kept low does gabapentin around like 200mgs a night,still on benzos and my tolerance has goen ou tthe window.

here is the problem,I recently weaned off the gabapentin and sleep is impossible,severe,and I mean severe GI issues.This is commonly heard of in other "lyrica withdrawl" communities.

On halloween I landed in hosptial with pancreattis ,nearly died.I dont drink or do other drugs so I figure it was related to lyrica W/d.

The Gi issues,the bloating and the absolute hell of detox from both lyrica and gabapentin is almost too mch for this old lady.

I took very small amounts of oxycet for awhile,it helped but ultimatley caused issues with my stomache.

I need some serious help here and believe it or not u guys know more about drugs than doctors.

I have a 20yr benzo habit,now a mix of ativan and 10mgs valium.

I gained massive weight on lyrica,but it is nothing compared to the pregnant belly I have now.

I am in some deep sh**t here and could use any guidance.

My idea was to detox from lyrica first then attack benzos,but my tummy is compleltely fried.

and sleep is a nightmare. 

i tried upping the benzos to no avail,tried remeron for sleep ,have some backlofen havent tried it also have medical pot and have not tried it.

NOTHING helps my gut and i am not theonly one....thousands struggling with lyrica w/d ,and just hurting.

I realize my benzo use is complicating the w/d but hey will take along time to detox from.

Please,if you have any ideas why my gut is haywire,and an interim drug I would be grateful.

people have siad they feel lyrica has changed their insides in some weird way.I would agree but is it permanent? 

cant live likethis.

I have horrifc breathing issues with sleep apnea.so many drugs are off limits.

I even have some morphine at home,small amount.dont wanna go back to gabapentin even in smalll amounts.

have a bupe patch lotza drugs ,terrified to take any of them.

3and 1/2 yrs of lyrica with benzos and here i am with horrific issues.

Please anyone that can give me some ideas -drs say go bk to gabapentin,they dont give a sh*t,but I do.I would be grateful for some response.

This is nothing short of hel,and I can only imagine the benzo withdrawl.

thank you for your response.

Katy

I'm about to start taking pregabalin instead of gabapentin again, for severe neuropathy. I just recently started taking clonazepam again, 2mg twice a day, so 2mg twice, about 8-10 hours apart.

   I guess my question is, does anyone here have any experience mixing the two, and how much is the pregabalin going to potentiate the clonazepam? I will be taking 150mg pregabalin 3x/day. So, how strong will the clonazepam be at this dose? Is there a way to find out? Will the 4mg end up feeling like 5, or maybe 6mg?

   I'm sure you all see where I'm coming from. I also take 400mg tramadol/day, and will be starting on another pain medication soon, a stronger one. I am currently tapering off methadone because I just had major surgery, but they still don't have a problem with me being on pain meds, because tramadol does NOT cut it. And methadone is a terrible, worthless painkiller.

   But anyhow, my main question is: How strong will the clonazepam end up feeling, dosage-wise?

I have been on pregabalin for a while and here is my experiences. I have not been trying to get myself "high" on lyrica as I take it for anxiety (GAD). In Norway you can it for anxiety, but it is expencive. The first time I tried it was fantasic. It felt like I got my life back and for the next week it worked well. Then nothing. My startdose was 150 mg pr day. I upped to 300 and then 450 and decieded after a few months to discontinue it. I quit cold turkey and the WD was not too bad. A little more anxious than normal but not to bad. I had maybe 5 capsules left and decided to tapper off after all as to not waste the meds. I took 150 mg and WOW the feeling was back! I felt so good again. I tried another one the next day and did not get the same feeling. After that I tried every other day. 150 mg. And that is what I have done for a long while now and the good feeling has continued to be there and no tolerance. I think the reason is that I take such a small dose and let the pregabalin leave my body before I take a new one. It makes the days I dont take it a little harder but sometimes I take a benzo or Aterax. Sometimes nothing at all. Merry Christmas

ummmm.......soooo i ended a 7 year opiate run - which eventually led to IV heroin....been clean about 6 months and  got prescribed gabapentin for old ankle injury (how the opiates started) anyway took 1500mg of the gaba loved the buzz...ended up getting my hand on lyrica but had to take over 2000mg to feel it but when i do i loveeeeee it. Only time im happy and in a good mood, feel energized etc if i take alot like 3000/3600mg its like im drunk with my coordination and nodding but it lasts all day and into the next day and when it wears down a little like when i wake up in the morning, or if i only take 1500 to 2000 mg i just feel a little wired, happy, friendly, social, if i could feel like this everday my life would be sooooo much better....i find as long as i keep it to the weekends, or at least 4 days in between i still feel the full effects. but i notice no one else takes nearly that much...i know the 3000 is crazy, and thats only when i wanna be FUCKED up lol but still even the 2000mg seems ALOT compared to any one else on here....any thoughts??

At first I got a slightly euphoric effect from lyrica (100 mg). Now it's not there anymore, although this could be partly a result of my weekend drug abuse.

For me it's also not sedative at all, it makes me awake.

I take it for anxiety, not recreational, right now 100 mg twice daily. 

To you other taking it on  daily basis: What do you do if you go to a party? Just drink? Any other drugs?

ill have to pregabalin and stimulants especially adderall have a wonderful synergy for me at like 800 mg i got perscribed lyrica 200/3x daily and abuse it every other day although its nothing like it used to be... even if i take a break still wonderful for a little mood lift complimenting stimulant/opiate highs, and makes em longer as well as a bad stimulant crash if no benzos are around

I just got prescribed this 50x3 for back pain. What are your guys (and gals) thoughts on combining a therapeutic dose with cannabis and/or a low amount (teaspoon or less) of kratom?  I regularly mix these with temazepam and alprazolam so I know what to expect with benzos but do you think it would be safe with Lyrica?


Also, since I like to take benzos 1-2 times a week and have for around 10 months. Will I still be able to and avoid becoming dependent? I know Lyrica is a gaba drug but would it be the same as just taking benzos by themselves?

Depends on how strong your kratom is. I tried this recently and a low amount worked. I then tried a little more and passed out. I think the stimulation will be normal or even diminished, while the sedation will be increased. That would mean it'll be easier to overdose.

I would also expect that you'll need a lower amount of benzos.


@intelligentmind: Yes, it will. (at least for me and probably most people)

My kratom is just plain leaf and I'd say pretty decent quality. I'm not a daily user and I only do low amounts, one teaspoon with some weed gives me good effects. If I take it with a benzo with it I'll either take my normal dose and wait a couple hours so I can still enjoy the stimulation, if I take it at the same time as the benzo I do 1/4-1/2 teaspoon. 


I'll probably have to skip the lyrica then when I take a benzo because my temazepam are 30mg capsules and my xanax is .5mg (1/4 of a bar) so it would be a bit difficult to reduce the amount. 


When lyrica is mixed with benzos is it like just taking too much benzo and you'll just pass out and wonder what the fuck happened or is dangerous like mixing benzos and alcohol?

Na, what i meant is taking mdma without lyrica....I have just started taking lyrica so i plan to stop taking it on the day of mdma...other people have said it will work as it;'s not like an anti depressant where it affects your serotonin and you have to be off the anti depressant for weeks sometimes months to feel the effects

I tried 50mg with a couple vapor hits  and all I got was anxiety. I know this is a very low dose but I figured being a gaba drug it would keep the anxiety away.

Anybody else experience some pain and sensitivity (in my case deltoid) when they first started taking Lyrica? I started taking it last thursday and have only took 50mg at night before bed except   for saturday which I didn't take any  and took 100mg last night with a .5mg of lorazepam. When I first took it I noticed my arms were a little sore when I woke up but it went away. Today when I woke up my detoids were  sore (like after getting a shot) and sensitive to touch. I took another 50mg at 3:00pm,  it's now 6:15pm  and it still hurts some  but not as bad. Is this fairly common when starting Lyrica  and if so can I expect it to go away when my body gets more used to the medication?


Thursday- 50mg

Friday-50mg

Saturday- none

Sunday- 50mg 

Monday- 100mg

Tuesday- 50mg so far

I have been taking Lyrica  3 x 75mg daily for the last year . It was prescribed for pain , but i found it worked well for anxiety as well . I have recently stopped taking it due to the amount of side affects associated with it . Made my vision very blurry which was kind of scary . I know people that are on lyica and it works great for them . Good Luck !!

I was wondering the same thing . I have have been prescribed baclofen and lyrica for severe back spasms , and I found they worked not bad , but was interested in asking for soma. I am in Canada though and when I asked the pharmacist about Carisoprodol ( Soma ) she said she has never heard of it . I think technically there is a moderate interaction between carisorodol and pregablin tho ...

I think it is individual and if you want a true high then you may have to skip more than one day. I have found that since all I want is to calm down and also get the mood stabilized then I can take 150 mg every other day and feel the same effects each time. Sometimes I do the same dose for 2 days then one day off and feel still the same. 90% of this stuff leaves the body through urine so most of it is gone by the time you take it again. 


When I first started it I did 150mg x 2 every day and then 150mg x 3 every day. That makes you build tolerance. I quit and didnt do any for ten days. Then I took one by mistake actually as they look the same as a vitamine supplement I take and the same good effect was back! Very happy!

So I just noticed something. For those of you with extreme tolerance like you, you can open up your lyrica, and get a screen. You take like 1,000-2,000mg and dump it in the screen and sift it. After sifting (if a small enough screen) you will be left with a pile of larger sized crystals that are not yet powderized. I believe this to be the pure pregabalin. You can then snort this.

I've tried the combo a few times now. 


50 and 100mg lyrica with .5mg  lorazepam- with 50mg I didn't really feel much but with 100mg it had me feeling pretty good. I did the same amounts with 15mg temazepam and with 50mg it felt like my first time again. 100mg and I passed out about 1.5 hours into it even with 320mg caffeine. 


New question: This saturday I'll be doing opiates which isn't  new to me but it's the first time doing it since being prescribed lyrica. I have done some searching on the subject but want to be safe. I take 100-150mg a day and can skip a day if needed but would rather not. Would dosing 50mg in the morning be fine if I plan to take my oxy (7.5mg) and hydro (10mg) at 9:00?  I'm not looking for potentiation but I don't want the drug to blunt the good feelings either which I've read a lot GABA drugs(benzos) do.  I have mixed 100mg with a about 3 grams of kratom and was pleasantly surprised by how much stronger the kratom felt.

I guess you mean short term memory?


I can get euphoric and awake from Lyrica, while most people will get sleepy. I would guess that maybe it's not a nootropic for everyone. But it'll help you calm down (if you take the right dosage) and get less anxious. Fear is the mind killer, as you may have heard, so for people with problems there this could actually work.

Otherwise, I've no idea.

It is definitely not a nootropic. In fact, it is probably the opposite.

It seems to come on  a little faster, it still takes forever though.   I usually  just open the capsules in my mouth so that a little dumps out on my tongue and chase it with water.

Hi people,


I'm currently on 2 x 20mg caps of Morphine Sulfate SR and 10-20mg oxy which I'm biting in half anyway. The drs don't want me on it too long so I was told at first I'd most likely go on methodone but today the pain specialist said I'd go on Lyrica. I love what oxy does but I feel I need 5mg more each day to get same effects as the day before and I find even with crushing the morphine it doesn't do shit for me. 


What's the best start dose of Lyrica considering I'll be taking the other drugs at the same time? I want to feel nice and cosy again, last time I felt like that was with IM injected morphine.

i have alot of experience with lyrica i have introduced it to lots of friends and always start them on 400mg its the sweet spot for most people i know without tolerance and not to mention you don't want to chase the lyrica high everyday. Tolerance builds an extreme amount more than amphetamines, and opiates. I try to only dose every other day or like three times a week. FYI if you are interested in stimulants lyrica is completely synergistic with stimulants while adding tons of euphoria but comfort from side effects such as anxiety and vaso constriction which makes higher dose stims so much more enjoyable and adds lyrica own stimulant effect it felt like one of my first few highs on adderall before meth or anything and that was a dream so becareful its hella addictive and is a background substance like weed and compliments almost every drug for me esp opiates, stims. By the way if you take a light to moderate dose of lyrica 200-400mg and hour or two before your stim crash you feel as if you never took stims not like a drugged up xanax or opiate feel you just feel as if you didnt take any stim which is wonderful bc it keeps me from redosing and doesnt fuck me up at that dose just makes me feel normal its a god send sorry for the wall of text+800mg 60mg dextroamphetamine

If you're taking a few grams, its probably not Pregabalin.

i have 675mg of this. i have taken .5mg-1mg of xanax a day for about 2.5 years so i have a GABA tolerance. I have taken 300mg with very little feeling at all. Should I just eat 675mg for a recreational dose?

jasoncrest, do you mind if I ask what kind of high the Lyrica gave you? I only ask because my wife was stricken with what THEY said was Rheumatoid Arthritis and as they put her through an incredible amount of drugs of every type including one of the most expensive drugs called Lyrica. She was prescribed this for joint pain and maybe it was just her reaction but 1 of the 20mg capsules turned her into an instant jello mold in less than 10 minutes. She would remain that way for an hour or more and even though she was basically catatonic she still experienced the same amount joint pain only it made her care less about having it or to try less to rid herself of the pain . After reading your post I began wondering if maybe she had gotten a bad lot or something. Anyway. thanks for your time.. Billy

Is getting high on Lyrica safer than getting drunk? I took 900mg with a tiny amount of booze on saturday night and I really got off. The problem is that it requires a bigger dosage every time to take effect so if two months ago 450mg were enough to get off now I need at least 900mg. Maybe I should give it a rest for some weeks. Also, is it safer than opioids?

Bubblegummer, you need time between each time you take it. If you are not out to get high but just getting a nice buzz then 1-2 days is all that required, but if you take a huge amount then even more days are required.


I myself take it every other day and have done so for many months and still get the desired effect

In terms of recreational effects, using more than once a week significantly raises tolerance to the euphoric effects of pregabalin, *not* to the anxiolytic or neuropathic pain relief effects of it, in the first 4-6 months of usage anyways (my experience for 4-5 months at 200-300 mg/day pregabalin).

I would say anything over 900mg classifies as an overdose, and any dose over 600mg can cause seizures, so take a small dose of a *muscle-relaxing* benzo (not xanax) just in case; make sure you get your hands on something like Valium (2.5-5mg), Klonopin (0.125-0.25mg), or temazepam (7.5mg) with it just to prevent the chance of seizures by raising the seizure threshold.


Never drink alcohol with anything more than 300mg lyrica, it's simply too messy, dangerous, sloppy, and unpredictable.

I"m new here and got LYrica today for the first time since the insurance co and pharmacies have tracked by overuse of narcotics i.e. Percocet, Lortab, tramadol.


Anyway, I took 300 mg 4 hours and another 300 mg. a few minutes ago.  I feel quite mellow from the 1st 300.  What do you think I should expect in the next few hours and taking the additional 300..

If you would normally take this as medication, I would stop that experiment, as you'll probably bring your tolerance up.

Had no weight gain so far, but then again everyone in my family is more of the skinny type and I do a lot of amphetamine.

Anyway, if you take it against anxiety and it works for you your body will get into a calmer state and you'll burn less calories, so that seems logical for me.

Yes, this is a very common side effect.

I finally found a reliable way how this stuff works best: take it with a meal! Same goes for gabapentin. It still takes some time to kick in, but i've found the effects much stronger when ingested with a meal.

hmm, "much stronger"? 


interesting, i've never noticed that (only a much more gradual come-up).


> Absorption: Pregabalin is rapidly absorbed when administered on an empty stomach, with peak plasma concentrations occurring within one hour. Pregabalin oral bioavailability is estimated to be greater than or equal to 90% and is independent of dose. **The rate of pregabalin absorption is decreased when given with food resulting in a decrease in Cmax by approximately 25 to 30% and a delay in Tmax to approximately 2.5 hours. Administration with food, however, has no clinically significant effect on the extent of absorption.**

Strange.


I could swear that the gabapentin i've taken a week prior was also much more noticeable in effects when taken with a meal, or shortly before one. 


I'll have a further look on this for sure.


Btw, thanks for your interest!

When I woke up, I had a massive headache but Bayer migraine quickly took care of that. For another 6 or so hours, I was shaky and go go going. Felt like I was on coke or speed but there was no nasty comedown. I had absolutely no pain as well all day. Hmm.. Despite the headache, I'm definitely using up this script.

I found masturbating somewhat harder on pregabalin as in I would last longer akin to opiates but with a somewhat stronger orgasm sometimes or even no orgasm. Very strange. Enjoyable either way.

I've been on lyrica for almost 3 months and  it has been a miracle drug for me however late last week it simply stopped working. I don't abuse my medication  in fact I usually take less than what's prescribed (50mg x3). I've even tried taking an extra pill to see if it helps, it didn't. Three months usage at such a low dose seems like a very short time for a medication to stop working...hell even my old antidepressant lasted longer than that lol. 


I also take benzos 2-3 days a week and when I do take them they are potentiated with prebabalin. I see people who have been on this medication for years and mine craps out after 3 months?

I still don't know why this happens to some of us.

Somehow I got the feeling that I got part of the magic back.

People are describing several ways to do that, using gabapentin, benzos or nmda antagonists (and combinations of those).

I tried benzos and ketamine, also dxm, but it didn't really work out.

However, I tried oxycodone for the first time this weekend (and none of the others), so if it really worked, it's maybe related to that.


Good luck tryin'.

supposed to take 3x150mg a day of this stuff for anxiety however it does built a tolerance pretty quickly and is useless. there is some recreational value, i've taken 900mg today and it really feels nice with some alcohol, if you take too much it kind of puts you in a stupor and makes you somewhat dumb. overall nice drug but has tolerance problems.

It also seems to raise your benzo tolerance. Does anybody know of anything else other than antidepressants that will work with nerve pain? I'm hoping that I'm just having a flare up and lyrica will start working again.

cant believe i just deleted a mega thread!!! stupid post reply button!

Anyway im now in the Prebabalin / LYRICA club,i'm also an opiate user and i find the pregabs stave off withdrawal for some reason? anyhow if your new to lyrica and you want to use it for recreational use it is a great synergistic so it goes well with benzos and opiates, My 1st dose of the drug was 300ml and this had me bouncing off walls and i was cross eyed! a very plesant drunkish/heroinish feel.beware the peek times as pregabalin is a creeper so your talking 2 hours to come up so don't go swallowing loads cos after 20 mins nothing is happening!! at this very moment i'm on 400ml and though i'm sat up in bed it does feel like my eyes are being pulled over the top of my head and i am finding it hard to type & when im not typing i'm squeezing my laptop really hard.strange drug? I hear the withdrawl is a bitch so i'm not going to keep taking them cos if it is anything like a benzo rattle!? well that is just scary! I can report tolerance builds very fast with this drug, I plan on doing maybe 6-800ml for the buzz cos i hear the visuals are quite good & this is a likable drug but for me it will be a short lived thing as i cant source them and i dont fancy another drug to cope with withdrawal symptoms!A real shame i cant get them prescribed or any GABA for that matter as i find they are great for depression ![:-)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) I HATE SSRI/SNRI type drugs they belong down the throats of BIG PHAMA folk-see how they like them! they can stick there prozac!!! sorry was i Ranting......(i'm mad you see) PREGABALIN RULE'S for the time being.

Im finding Pregabalin to be a right bag of tricks. I had really bad shoulder pain a couple of weeks ago, 1 pregabalin completely blocked all pain better than any other painkiller ive tried. I knew whatever was wrong, seized muscle or something, was still there, and it got me through the worst of the pain. I didnt want to take it for more than a few days as i read there are w/ds.


Recreationally 1 pill definately puts me in a better mood. More than 3 oir 4 and i find the experience becomes almost trippy and scary. Unwelcome thoughts keep popping up and all that as well as some helpful thoughts that feel like brand new insights.

Pretty awesome drug, been doing it for a while now, altho the withdrawals i got after 3 in a row days of usage were fucking terrible, felt like i wanted to die (didnt want to pass untill i took a small dose just for it to go off, i also didnt want to take a small dose for withdrawals since i od'ed a couple of days earlier, had hypertension and some bad reaction after i dosed a 20 mg codeine pill, uncertain what happend..)

erm well i have a friend who mix's the two but i don't know the amounts but i would not take loads of mirtazapine as i feel that could be a bad time. Now me,I can't believe how quick tolerance builds up with Lyrica! only been 5 days of up and down dosses ranging from 400ml to 1000ml and i took 800ml today and i cant feel them at all. strange drug indeed. I do hope i don't have a nightmare withdrawal. and the time it takes for you to come up on the drug is sporadic too,one time it was 2 hours and another it was 8 hours! i cant get my head round this drug.very unpredictable imo.

i would love to punch my Dr through the neck pull out his spine show it to him and say"oh so you do have a backbone after all!" they hide behind red tape where i live.

pisses me off as Lyrica makes me feel normal and not depressed.  But funny thing is my Dr would shower me with any ssri or snri you choose to name THE PRICK.

Because Benzos/Lyrica are a terrible solution for depression and maybe if you had the training and education your doctor does you would know that.

well i suppose 20 years of drug use/abuse/addiction & owning most copies of the British National Formulary and also attending(which is mostly owned by the share holders who happen to be the Doctors who work there)  my local surgery's annual meetings where the work ethics are discussed etc with questions & answers being allowed i do have a grasp on prescribing habits, and you would be naive to think otherwise that all the Dr's there are not deliberately pushing SSRI/SNRI drugs with an agenda (share holders perhaps!) also the spineless Dr's don't like you having excellent information about the drug that works for you and the ensuring argument that arises as the Dr realizes that he will either have to concede and accept there may be a valid point to my argument but they dare not prescribe said drugs for fear of been called to task by the other staff at this tightly knit surgery they decline and offer the standard government stance & guideline drug even though it is unsuitable for the patient (ME) It has become a tedious and predictive practice going to my GP or any GP in the UK where these "surgery's" spring up !


 If you have the old school Dr with his own practice they are much better as there not bound by the constraints put upon them by the likes of these surgery's where all the towns Doctors are placed in one building that has become nothing more than a "corporation". The conclusion i have come to is that it is one rule for one patient and another rule for the other!

This is how so many benzo's and GABA type drugs end up on the streets,I know cos i hear the story's of how folk get prescribed the drugs and they don't match the symptoms! what your saying is true to a point, yet there are exceptions where inappropriate prescribing is happening with these drugs.

Doesn't your health care system allow you to change to one of the old school doctors?

It's not that I'm really good right now, but lyrica helps me way more than the ssris/snris I tried.


Good luck and get well soon!

I wish it was that simple happy wanderer, But as i said it's a small town with all the Dr's having a share in the holdings of the "surgery" so they all stick to each others guidelines for prescribing and dare not step out from there comfort zone when it comes to giving out drugs they see as addictive/habit forming (NOW FORGET YOUR ON SSRI/SNRI FOR LIFE IN SOME CASES)and i cannot join another smaller practice where the staff do care about what the patient thinks as i'm not in the area designated to me for treatment.


Now add that my file has DO NOT PRESCRIBE (place any of the "desirable drugs here") TO THIS PATIENT cos i'm registered with COMPASS and you begin to see my predicament. God only knows what COMPASS and the GP they use has to do with my other Dr as compass wont prescribe the drugs on this ban list so i cannot win!


AND THEY WONDER WHY FOLK MEDICATE THEMSELVES WITH DRUGS BOUGHT OFF PATIENTS ON THE STREETS! it makes me mad.  Thankyou for the well wish's

Scripto, I'm in the UK and in exactly the same position as you.


I have developed a few problems after a few years of drug use. I ended up taking downers and eventually I tapered off Diazepam with assistance of my doctor. I was very honest with my doctor and I told him all of my (drug) history - that probably was a bad idea.


I have found only 2 medications that truly help me with anxiety, depression etc - Pregabalin and Baclofen. They are both quite easy to get online but I don't want to self medicate any more. I have asked on several occasions to be prescribed Pregabalin/Baclofen to help me live my life normally and not crave other drugs but the doctors just say no.


I end up buying weed, benzos, opiates etc to try and deal with life but they are all expensive and addictive and they aren't the solution. It would clearly be much better if I was prescribed 300mg Pregabalin twice a day from my doc and not feel the need to take other drugs.


I have the same situation with the local surgeries, the same doctors move between the 3-4 local ones that I am able to use. I can't use a different surgery (with different doctors) for the same reason, I'm not in their designated area.


Until my doctor truly understands my situation it looks like I'll be taking a cocktail of stuff, that I shouldn't be taking, just to feel like a semi-normal person. I've even started drinking more lately, alcohol has never been my thing but it hits those GABA receptors and helps me relax...


Are you self-prescribing atm Scripto?

Hello all. Just found this thread after i started one in the'other drugs' forum. I am currently using lyrica to try and quit a 50ml/day methadone habit(8 years off use on and off with smack). I am now on day 3, with no methadone...feeling fine with just a few shivers down my back.....no sickness, no restless legs(god I hate that), no sleeplessness or stomach cramps etc,etc. I have had about 1050mg spread over the three days in 300mg doses and I think a 150mg dose. I can't quite beleive it and I am waiting for the sickness to hit....but so far no sign! Has anybody else tried to detox using Lyrica? Will keep posting to let you know any developments.

Thanks all, anon

i was co-prescribed them for the longest time, however, recreationally (and in my case also as an antidepressant) mirtazapine is useless. makes an excellent sleeping pill though, so i'd keep them around just for that, but then i'm prone to insomnia.

this is bullshit. pregabalin's mode of action is distinct from all other gabaergics save for gabapentin and that is the only drug it shares a cross-tolerance with. GABAa agonists (e.g. alcohol, benzos, barbiturates etc.) share cross-tolerance as do GABAb agonists (GHB, baclofen, phenibut). in my rather extensive experience with all these substances, i can safely say that if anything it lowers the tolerance i.e. potentiates other gabaergics.

Lyrica is great for anxiety, and is effective at 300mg dosages.

Recreation wise, it isn't really suitable as 'party drug'. It potentiates opiates by ten fold. 1.8g of kratom + 300mg Lyrica had me nodding off and extensively hampers motor skills. 


It also potentiates alcohol, but not as much (compared to benzo+booze combos). 


Tolerance builds quite quickly, for instance if you down 300mg on day 1, on day 3 you will need at least 600mg to get the same desired effects. However, if you give it a break for 3-7 days, you will be able to recover the "magic".


My advice is not take it with heroic dosages like what I'm reading...anything above 600mg is way too excessive. And as mentioned before, the onset period takes about 2-3 hours to kick in (even if you're on an empty stomach). The cognitive and motor skill impairment can be resolved with some green tea or if you prefer...take some amps.

I have heard that Lyrica can really help the symptoms of Methadone withdrawels but to what extent I am not sure but am about to find out myself. I would think it would take a lot of lyrica because methadone wd's last forever like weeks!! I am about to find out myself but I have a 3 months supply at 900/mg's a day for nerve damage. I will probably go through that in 6 weeks because 2 weeks from now I will be done at my clinic as I can't afford to pay them anymore and Im at 80mg a day. Luckily I get Lyrica free from the paitent assistance program.  I wish you luck because I hear methadone withdrawels are hell!

Hi All, lyrica definately works against opiate withdrawals, but it can also prevent much of a benzo WD like i found out its just that its impossible to keep dosing guided by tolerance, because in two weeks you have to take 3 grams or so a day so that wont happen.


Pregabalin is a med what should be respected if you abuse it and doing so too often, whenever 'too often',  then you will end up with problems to say the last, because where pregabalin works against opiate/benzo withdrawals certainly doesn't mean that benzo's and/or opiates can make you feel better in case of lyrica withdrawal its only lyrica what helps when its needed or the weaker version of lyric being gabapentin can also be used to reduce the dose.


I see all these stories about lyrica withdrawal with some people already claiming withdrawals after using lyrica for only 3 month in high doses though like 900-1200 mg, but i already take 900 mg lyrica everyday for about a year and a half, that is the dose i am allowed to take in the beginning i abused lyrica for it feels so good, but if i like to feel that feeling again atleast a week without lyrica would be needed.

Anyway my point is that withdrawals from lyrica can occur fast, in time or else as good as never so for me not taking lyrica then i dont feel too great, but its not to much from lacking lyrica the real reason is thatmy substances dont get potentiated anymore.


Something else what should be watched for is the fact that lyrica has this tendency to 'poop out' fast like in some months whereas at first it worked fine against anxiety, but somebody with anxiety problems who use a med what helps that problem then if the med is stopped to be taken then anxiety can go trough the roof so i like to advise you to have say 50 lyrica's of say 150 mg in case of emergency so exactly for that reason i managed to get a decent stash of 100 capsules 300 mg each.


For me its no problem if lyrica poops out, because anxiety is not a problem i just liked to try this substance, but for anybody else with anxiety taking lyrica it can work like a charm and not in two weeks or so no straight away basically and if not the dose could go a bit higher, but if that also doesn't work then its useless to bother with lyrica, because you dont react onto the substance.


If you have lyrica and want to abuse it then dont take more then 300 mg at first that may sound low, but believe me when i tell you that the effect will not be low more so not if you would add say 5 mg diazepam it would feel like you took five times those 5 mg, but doing this is ofcourse risky so for whomever who wants to abuse lyrica start low and if possible dont use a benzo at first you can always add more.

Lyrica's strong potentiating of benzo's does not mean that the other way around pregabalin can substituted by benzo'sthis is not the case and i believe i already mentioned this, excuse me i will shut up now.


Let me give you some numbers i read about so what docs and shrinks know, i hope, is that when somebody starts lyrica then chances are 50% or higher that it will work in some days once you hit the proper dose, secondly the remaining 50% of people feel better then before, but not better compared to the first group, but i think any relief would feel like a god gift, and last but not least there is an amount of people, or percentage if you like, who dont react on lyrica at all.


Oh yeah before i forget in Europe lyrica is approved for generalised anxiety disorder so its used heavily for this matter and if lyrica wouldn't work so well people wont take it.


What lyrica does for me is removing the depression i had a year and a half ago so lyrica does work against depression and still works behind 1.5 year, but initially i chased that buzz luckily i realised fast that lyrica is bad news if you keep chasing the buzz so i started to respect this med as should and therefore it only advantages me when i take 900 mg a day as prescribed to me. It took about a week for me to find out that you cant fight lyrica tolerance, except if you up the dose almost daily, but ofcourse my month script was gone so since i still had this shrink i called him for more meds his reply was that i get nothing and that it was my choice to take more.

Well that was a bummer, but the good thing was that i could not take lyrica then when i had it again i 'only' dropped 900 mg in one go and i cannot remember to feel better being buzzed o9n a way i cannot compare with other CNS meds, but they give lyrica all kinds of phantasy names. So far.

Someone please answer this quick.  I am  on  neurontin  600 the times a day and i gave my friend a sub for a sample bottle of  75s. I took them all but one and felt great.  If  i shoot 75 what would it be equal to roughly add an oral dose?  And will  taking some neurontin bring me back up /?

Twenty minutes later : fuck man I just banged my last pill and i didn't even miss and two minutes later my leg is burning like hell. I didn't get an initial rush like you do with dope.  I might feel one creeping on now but it could be placebo.  Someone tell me how these drugs fair with lyrica because it's what i have  a.  Gabapentin  b. Lager c. Clonazepam  d. Suboxone  and also remeron.  Someone advice! 

Love you guys

One thing i can tell you straight away and that is that shooting pregabalin does not deliver extra effect, except for a faster onset, but can you wait for about an hour being the time to reach a max bloodlevel for oral pregabalin? Also oral pregabalin has a bio availability of 90% and it will be excreted unchanged by your kidneys this made some geniusses think that you can drink your piss.


I wonder howcome your leg burned as hell when you said you didn't even miss, but when you did draw up some blood was this lightred as opposed to almost dark brown reddish? If it was lightred then instead of a vein you hit an artery something i think you actually did when two minutes later your whole leg burned like hell so maybe adjusting your shooting technique is the first thing to consider provided you did hit that artery, but it surely sounds like that luckily though the fluid you injected did not block up the tiniest little veins better known as cappilaries else you could have lost a foot to start with so be careful man and dont shoot something what isn't meant to use as such.


I only have 300 mg lyrica capsules, but when i squeeze one it doesn't feel like there is much powder inside such a capsule so that's pregabalin with a few binders who to your luck are all watersolulable.

You mean you are on 600 mg neurontin three times a day? I dont know what it means when you say you gave a friend a sub' for a sample bottle of 75's, but this sample bottle was it lyrica or neurontin?


I will assume that these 75's are pregabalin i dont think neurontin goes that low per dosing unit so if you have a bottle of 75's being pregabalin then reasonable enough to assume there are 60 capsules in that bottle? That should be more or less correct, but if you like to feel how a lyrica buzz feels then to start with dont take more then 1/3 of your used to dose of clonazepam the subuxone can just be taken while we dont even have to talk about gabapentin or remeron.


You know what's a bit funny that is that taking say 300 mg orally then in an hour it reaches max bloodlevel, but from there you can easily add 2 hours more so 3 in total by then lyrica acts fully and if you took 1/3 of your clonaz, your sub and further nothing then about 3 hours after taking pregabalin it's effect becomes very pronounced only if that happened at 600 mg means that the day after you already need 1200 mg and the day there after no lyrica amount gets you buzzed, except if you would exceed taking 3 gram + a day the day after you might need 4 gram with barely any effect so respect pregabalin if you do it can be very helpful for many addicts, but abuse it and it will fuck you over.


Something else interesting when it comes to using pregabalin for quite some time and if it could cause dependence in such a case well i think if pregabalin was used for say a year at 900 mg a day then some people will have some extent of lyrica WD, but most people will not get problems in WD sense for lyrica i did find out that that for those people for whom it worked so well as anti anxiety aid then when lyrica gets stopped or is wanted to get stopped then even when people complain about lyrica that it 'poops out' against anxiety, but anxiety for people with the 'poop out' think can go trough the roof so its advisable to have a benzo ready to use when needed.


Lyrica potentiates benzo's and does that bigtime as never in 25 years of addiction i bounced into a med with such a strong effect when combined with benzo's, but where lyrica potentiates benzo's and if you stop lyrica and be pregabalin dependent then you will find out that benzo's barely work against pregabalin withdrawal i think gabapentin would do a better job here plus in case you use other substances then first find out how it makes you feel combined with the rest.

How pregabalin works is unknown sure there is this agonism to voltage dependent calcium channels and due to that action they think that pregabalin prevents too much presence of certain neurotransmitters like Substance P is one, Nor Adrenaline is one, Glutamate is one, but if 'they think' neurotransmitters like that need to be watched while at the same time its quite possible that a range of neurotransmitters whether get produced whether become less and some of them stop acting completely so by now i believe they discovered something like 45 neurotransmitters and pregabalin does possibly more then we know, not that this would stop me from taking it though.


I am a year and a half on lyrica at 900 mg daily, but a few weeks ago i decided to drop 300 mg expecting insomnia at the least only nothing bad happened more the opposite happened, because taking 600 mg instead of 900 mg always in one go should had given me withdrawal symptoms, but nothing its just a damned pity that its almost impossible to say upfront who will have to withdraw in time.


If i had the amount of subscanes you mention then the lager has to go i dont like beer, but looking at the substances you have and what i would do with the same amount of substances to get a buzz then the bupe will be dropped so that would be pregabalin and not gabapentin then if it was my firsttime i would not take more then 1/3 of the usual clonaz amount and the remeron well if you take this med to treat depression then know that mirtazapine (remeron) is considered  as the most effective anti depressants from them all.

Ah now i get it you gave your a friend a 'sub' and you meant subuxone sorry man i should had known this.

Drinking lager while you also swallowed pregabalin it can be done, but not when you want to go out, because pregabalin potentiates alcohol strongly so even behind two normal sized glasses of beer drank within half an hour you may feel close to being drunk.


When you felt lyrica creeping up then this was only the effect of your cardiovascular system getting back to normal like when you missed a shot then you still get the buzz in most cases, but you in case i am right about using the artery without you knowing plus what you swallowed before then an amount of pregabalin was in your system.

Damn i wished you would ask straight questions insteadof having to leave me with guessing what you mean, but i see one straight question being 75 mg pregabalin and what that dose would become if you inject it compared to orally, but the difference is truly minimal and should be disencouraged to do. Based on 90% biovavailability orally gives you 800 mg inside you taken by mouth, but if you inject the capsules then if everything is is theoretically okay you would looks at 800 mg extra for the price of more pokes in your arms. Well i think i better shut up by now if there are questions i hope i see them.

Hi! I´m new here on BL, but this thread is really interesting. First I must say that I´ve never used drugs to get high and never had an addiction to anything. But a couple of weeks ago my doctor prescribed me Lyrica 150 mg for my neckpain and pain in the hipjoint and lower back. I have never taken this before and reading this thread scares the hell out of me!!! First; I don´t want to get "high" and I don´t want to experience any side effects. I also suffer from agoraphobia (both with and without panic attacks) and anxiety. One of the side effects described is vomitting...... That is one of my greatest fears in the world and I´d do anything to prevent it. Have any of you had that experience?

My doctor told me to take 1x 150 mg 1- 2 times a day, but after what I´ve read in here I´m not so sure I dare to take them at all...... The package just lies in the cabinet unopened..... Please help a nervewreck from Norway on what to do?

I never had the urge to vomit from lyrica. Plus, it'll most likely help with your anxiety, as it helps me.

I think you'll be fine.

Maybe start at home to see what will happen, as is started with 75 mg and it interfered (slightly) with my ability to walk at first. Though not when i took only 75 mg, but when I took 150 mg. Anyway, that passed by after some days and wasn't that bad at all (I worked as a waiter when I started taking it).

I'm on 200 mg twice a day and I think I can still drive. 

Though I'd be cautious to do so in the first days. I think you'll see yourself, if you can still drive. 

Maybe try it on a weekend, start friday evening and you'll see. 

If you feel you can't drive while on lyrica on sunday, you'll still have the option to stop taking it and be sober on monday morning.


You wrote your doctors said 1-2 times a day, so another option would be: Take 150 mg in the evening and it'll be out of your system in the morning.


I suppose you're sitting a lot at work? Also, have you had any injuries causing your pain?

That sounds like a good advice. Thank you. 


Yes, the doctor said 1-2 times a day; 1 in the morning and the next at night if the pain was still there or had gotten worse. I also sit a lot at work talking in the phone an registering patients. 


I have prolapse in my neck (since december) and lower back (since 2005) and on top of that bursitis in my right hip and the pain is almost unbearable at times....

Since he prescribed it for my pain I´m a bit scared of getting "addicted" after reading this thread if I start using it. Seems like a lot of people in here like it a lot as a drug, but that´s not what I want. I just want to get some painrelief and maybe a bonus for my anxiety as well.

Judging from your first post you don't seem to be an addictive personality.

While some here say that Lyrica is addictive for them, officially it's not. Maybe everyone sold out to the pharmaceutical industry, but I'd guess that it is addictive for some people, while It's not for most. 


As far as I can tell from what you told me I'd guess (from my similar experience) that your pain problems are strongly to your anxiety and your stance of body (I hope that's the right term) at your workplace. While Lyrica will possibly help you with both: Have you tried workout? Helped me a lot.

Ok, of course that's not the same for everyone. A lot of my pain is related to anxiety and depression, because if think about things that make me anxious the muscle tension rises plus I grind my teeth (now only at night). Brings me in the wrong posture, more muscles begin to ache and cramp => a man is all pain.

In my experience (I have experience mainly with venlafaxin and citalopram) that's a good choice. Fast effects, it possibly will help with your pain, your anxiety and maybe even with the depression. SSRI's and SNRI's need time to kick in and I had less benefit from them.

A lot has to happen before I'll let a surgeon on my spine, if that's what you are talking about. 

I've had problems with my lower back for many years and now it's almost gone. 

I did workout at Kieser Training, the have some special machines to train the large muscle at your lower back isolated, not everything is positive there, but that really helped me a lot. They are not in Norway, but you can take a look [here](http://www.kieser-training.com/en/therapy/back-test/). The machine is not just for testing, but also for training with assistance. There is also a do-it-all-yourself [variant](http://www.kieser-training.com/en/training/muscle-exercises/f3_backextension/). Maybe you'll find some company who offers sth. similar.

I never really expected for my pain in this part of my body to go away, but it really worked.

A little warning i think i should put here about taking lyrica all the time together with benzo's for the reason that say 600 mg lyrica, 2/3 of my dose, combined with a benzo potentiates the hell out of the benzo, but yesterday i could lay my hands on 180 of the 0.5 mg xanax pills for no prices so i decided to start low and swallowed 3 mg xanax then an hour later i felt nothing so i thought WTF and dropped another 2 mg to find out there was no effect at all and i could not figure out why this was so.


Then this morning when i started my workout my nose kept running and that is not usual then it hit me and i realised that yesterday having to arrange the xanax made me completely forget to take my 600 mg lyrica plus the 75 mg oxazepam, but let this be a warning so that it becomes known that you can help a benzo addiction bigtime by using lyrica, but using a benzo in case of a lyrica dependency is about useless.

It does take a while before lyrica dependence occurs, but behind say 15 months taking it daily at 600-900 mg by then there is some extent of lyrica dependence and only lyrica can help the symptoms further without the lyrica you find out that whatever you took together with lyrica like in my case a lot of benzo and a lot of methadone then the effect from the latter substances is a hell of a lot less until your body caught up with lyrica dependence, however i have no idea howlong that would take if you are already having lyrica to do a taper if not and you do use it i advice you to create a stash in case of emergency.


Ironically people who use lyrica for the lyrica buzz find out that this can be done if lyrica wont be used more often then twice a week so in other words people who abuse lyrica like that wont become dependent while the people who take it as prescribed daily for ages like longer then a year in therapeuthic doses have a much higher chance to become lyrica dependent, but no matter what its not so easy to become lyrica dependent, because the people who take it as prescribed mainly notice that behind a few months the benefit is gone the med will be stopped and that is that.

I think i fucked myself over by taking lyrica for about a year and a half now, but alright i have a decent stash also i dont expect anybody will take it away, because i lost the shrink i used to had, but in spite of saying so i dont have another one yet, which is fine by me, because my meds keep coming every 4 weeks automatically.


Anyway before i talk too much like usual take extreme caution with combining lyrica with whatever else, because upfront you can never predict how a benzo will hit you together with lyrica further when possible try to prevent lyrica dependence by for example every six months a two week or even a one month break in using it. Together with lyrica 1/3 or 1/4 of your used to benzo dose could get you in state you dont want so be warned. So far.

Officially it's non addictive. While some people claim it is, that still doesn't mean it's for everybody. I think for long time users it's best to phase it out slowly.

in my experience pregabalin is not a terribly addictive drug. i took it at 600mg/day for about 6 months, stopped taking it because the anxiolytic effects were pretty faded, i got it prescribed for generalized anxiety disorder. these days i take it about 2-3 a week on average in higher doses (usually 900-1500mg) and it's a good anxiolytic, the only downside being that it takes forever to kick in. i've been using it now for over 2 years and never experienced ill effects from the substance. it helped me greatly to reduce my benzo intake.

For me drinking works pretty normal again, wasn't in the beginning of the treatment (started in december).

I'm pretty sure Lyrica interferes with my memory though, which is why I want to reduce dosages.


xxxyyy, no problems with your walking at such high doses?

^ no, pregabalin never gave me any trouble with my balance. sometimes it makes me tremble like fuck if i overdo it though. taking too much pregabalin is not pleasant at all. however since i've been taking it for quite a while i have a robust tolerance to the stuff. friends of mine who never took it before usually got a good effect out of a single 300mg cap.

I've been abusing lyrica for a few years on and off.  Let me just say it is right now my DOC and very addictive.  Not like everyday addiction(wasteful and tolerance builds so quick), but after a few days and knowing my tolerance has declined I am inclined mentally to take it.


Very enjoyable, but I do suffer from anxiety and depression, which it temporarily ceases.


1400mg of pregabalin and off to work for me.

For me, Lyrica is a wonder drug. At moderate doses (I have a very high tolerance so that's 600-750mg, or 900mg after repeated dosing) I am lifted out of my depression, I am able to deal with major issues in my life that I avoid like the plague and cannot confront normally, and my social anxiety is *completely* eradicated.  


I become the person that I feel I was meant to be, outgoing with a positive outlook, more energetic, extremely open, and more appreciative of beauty in the world.  And all of this without the dopamine rush that is present with opiates or amphetamines, which I've used in the past in attempts to make myself more functional.  Hence it's not terribly addictive, although the functionality that I get out of it makes it addictive.  ![:|](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eyesclosed.gif)    Also for me it helps with opiate cravings becaues half of what I crave from opiates is the functionality they give me by putting me in a great mood.  


At higher doses (for me 1200-1500mg) I get a heavy alcohol-like effect that I don't really like.  But at lower doses there is only a light impairment of my motor skills and it's almost like I'm on a low dose of MDMA with a weed brownie on top.  This stuff has great potential for use in psychotherapy; I imagine that if one were to take some lyrica and see a therapist it would be many times more productive than a normal session would be.  


I feel like most people don't see Lyrica's magic, or maybe it just isn't there for them. And oddly enough I took it for a couple years before I realized that lower dosing has a much more magical effect than high let's-get-fucked-up dosing.   


I would really like to hear from anyone else who gets this quasi-panacea incredible effect from Lyrica.  This is probably limited to people who suffer from at least depression *or* anxiety, as those are the things that Lyrica alleviates for me. I've been reading here for years so I know that a lot of Bluelighters do suffer from those things.


I'm going to peruse this huge thread looking for similar experiences, but after reading a few pages and not seeing a lot of experiences similar to mine, I wanted to share my perhaps-somewhat-unique experience with Lyrica and see what you guys thought.    


Cheers,


RJ


Edit: reading through the thread, there are other people who talk about the antidepressant effect.  I honestly think it should be legal to prescribe it solely for depression (even independent of anxiety disorders) in the U.S. and anywhere else.  Especially when you consider how shitty and ineffective our current batch of SSRIs and SNRIs are...

RandomJoy: I was offered and prescribed Cipralex from my psychiatrist, but I said no because of the side effects that comes with it. I don´t want to become a zombie and loosing my sexlife as well among many other things. I´ve also heard from people I know and read in many forums that SSRI´s is a hell to cut out when 

it´s time to quit. I still haven´t tried my Lyrica and I got a lot of them from my doctor (for nervepain). I have never tried MDMA, amfetamine og any other drugs besides oksazepam 10 mg and diazepam 5 mg which I take when travelling with planes and sometimes to make me sleep through the night, so I have nothing to compare with........ 


Do you think Lyrica will help with my depression as well as my anxiety? I have both 25 mg and 150 mg and I´m wondering if I will have any effect of the 25 mg just to see if I react in some way? It´s the side effetcts that keeps me from trying them.......

Hey all

Im new to the site tho I used  use it all the time just for "research". I consider myself a very well educated drug addict. I used to be addicted to heroin and all types of fun back in the day barbiturates like Seconal Tuinal Placyidal- suffice to say I am bummed I Know NEED pain meds..its a bummer and as an addict its a testament to how sober I choose to be being I am now prescribed all the types of stuff  I used to WANT.,now I need..(.very ironic this life of ours). ANYWAY..these days I am now on 80 mgs of methadone for the last  10  years on and off-- I  smoke weed to stay sane and for my stomach- . I  have found the beauty of using psychedelics again- mostly mushrooms. SO (oh and Im a drug counselor as well who does NOT work in 12 step abstinence only programs.cause that's a bullshit treatment plan for addicts- harm reduction in my book works but to get clean hey- for you- whatever works...sorry I got off topic.. the topic is ..wtf is going on with LYRICA??

I was prescribed it for acute chronic pain in my back yesterday- I take 15 mg oxyis for my endometriosis- but I have to take 6 for it too even touch the pain. Regardless of for pain control or to get high- (the Lyrica did take away all the pain and even this morning I was still outta pain which was amazing for me) BUT  WTF is up with this Lyrica? I took 100 mgs yesterday - smoked some weed- and have almost no memory of the day. I was nodding out like a junkie. Im staying with a very very anti drug person and well- it was a .tough night trying to keep my eyes open. W HY DID I GET SO HIGH ON THIS DRUG? I have a tolerance to almost all drugs that is quite high- so why did I get so high  with this drug? I have done my research on it  but need some feedback from you guys..I also am prescribed Addoral which I realized immediately  would be insane to take with Lyrica. I really don't think much of Addoral--I used to shoot crystal in LA so I kinda think all those "speed" drugs are a joke. I take my pills for the reasons they are given for the most part. I had no intention of getting high yesterday -well maybe a little![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png) yet had clue it would make*** that ***stupidly stoned. The thought of taking Addoral with that drug to me is nuts- the brain must go crazy and I am shocked I see people writing they take both..if you could see what our brain chemistry is going thru..OMG! So the question here for everyone is- is that the normal reaction to Lyrica? getting nodding stoned? OR was it because I smoked the diesel- and I do take Klonopin but shit- im talking like 4 mgs and I have been taking them for 15 years- my tolerance to benzos is nuts ( i can easily take over 200 mgs of Valium or any benzo and I am fine- plus been taking benzos since I was 12- im in my 40's!) .. I need some help here so I don't take Lyrica and  fall into the  A train tracks here in NYC....any feedback wold be great..I'm kinda freaked out and a bit nervous as I do have access to other drugs but don't want to take them together and find myself in some silly situation like I did this morning...feeling hung over - wasted- and my non drug taking roomie staring at me like im a serial killer!.

thanks all

Peace~

Hey everyone, I have been taking lyrics for a few months I normally take it for a week and RU. Out and get my refill 2 weeks later I find in high doses it is amazing a. Very similar feeling to rolling being drunk and heroin all rolled into one little C4 pill. I was curious though from my knowledge of the drug apparently it is supposedto lower the seziure threshold..I ask this because about a week ago I gave a friend of mine a small dose maybe 600mg she is about 105 pounds soaking wet..long story short later on in that night she went to the hospital for a small seizure I was just curious if this has happened to anyone els or is this a totally unrelated incident.. Any feedback is greatly appreciated..thanks!!

In my experience Lyrica in somewhat higher doses 300mg+ range works really well with both depression and anxietly it will also make any opiate withdrawals your going threw  about 50% less intense..Everyone is different though start low you can wants take more never less, but Lyrica is very tolerable with massive doses being taken with much I'll effect..good luck hope I could help!!

I was able to go to my daughters spring concert with out klonopin because I honestly believe that Lyrica makes me the person I want and know I can be!  Such a miracle. As I have been on every antidepressant known to man.  I was started on psych. meds since I was thirteen! Praise be that I am feeling myself again after years of searching!

No it doesnt scare me because I responded to this drug is probably because i was lacking something gentically(sp) that lyrica now provides.

And what is your solution when the acute effects stop occuring, and your tolerance prevents you from stopping taking it?

I'm prescribed 225mg twice a day. Today I feel like shit and am on a right downer. Thinking of taking an extra 400mg. Is 1000mg a safe dose? Anyone tried it ?

^ i regularly take doses around 1200-1500mg, but i've been on pregabalin for two years, and i take it as needed, although i'm scripted 900mg a day. my tolerance is pretty high but you should have no problems with that dose. pregabalin has a pretty good safety profile as far as i know.

The only real bothersome side effect you may notice from a high dose is a tremor/shaking. I've had it happen to me pretty intensely, but you can avoid it by building up to a high dose instead of straight-up jumping in the deep end.

I have been using Gabapentin and Pregabalin for about 2 years now (Mostly gabapentin if I was without insurance).  I have had periods of taking it daily for 6 months at a time.  While the extreme "high" (drunk but in control) wears off, the overall sense of happiness, body buzz and euphoria have never gone away with daily use for me personally.  Everyone is different but I think there can still be plenty of nice effects to be had from daily dosing.  Just like there is a high tolerance buildup in opiates, you still can feel a decent effect.  This stuff potentiates the hell out of opiates.  


Also, regarding withdrawal, after daily use for months at a time, I have cessated on a few occasions.  Would I recommend it? No, as there is seizure risk.  However, I found that sweaty palms and hot/cold flashes for about a week occurred.  Was it intolerable? No.  Was it anywhere near the level of horror that I read on forums?  No.  Are we all going to have the same reactions? No.  These are just my personal experiences.  


I do think that the psychosomatic impact of expected withdrawals do impact the user more than one thinks.  Personally, this drug works very well for almost anything and while at very high doses I can find myself looking for words, at more therapeutic doses I find myself extremely witty and productive....all while still feeling a recreational value.  


At one point I was not doing ANY opiates and when I was scripted oxycodone, I was a bit bummed at how quick the euphoria went away.  The general "feel good" from Pregabalin lasts throughout the day for me and this is one drug I wouldn't mind being on indefinitely.  I guess maybe I am one of the lucky ones who seem to respond very very well to this drug.  


My previous drug of choice would have been oxycodone but this drug rates higher in my book with way fewer side effects....just for me.  For all those users who have similar results, we are pretty lucky because it's an easy drug to get scripted, the effects last for hours, and you can pretty much function very well on it without negative consequences (terrible drug seeking, preoccupation etc).  Again, I think the withdrawals are not as bad as many say.  I'm sure they are horrid in some, but so can stopping SSRIs abruptly.   So many people go on these drugs and have their doctors switch them with a fast titration off the drug and don't complain.  It's a great drug.


edit: My doses for gabapentin got up to 4k recreational.  2400mg daily gave me a euphoria and sense of well being that did not ever go away with tolerance.  My equal dose for Lyrica is about 600mg=2400mg Neurontin.  So with my quitting Neurontin at 2400mg daily for 6 months and functioning just fine at work outside of cold sweats (feet and hands) for about a week...isn't that bad IMO.

I'm thinking about tapering down or even just stop. 

The reason is the way it fucks with my memory. I had problems before, but it kinda got out of hand.

I'm not sure if I should go with a smaller dosage or not. I tried tapering down before (200mg->150mg), but I felt to depressed. Maybe I should have tried the lower dosage for a longer time.

PLEASE NOTE: THIS POST IS FOR CONVERSATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY AND NOT MEANT AS A GUIDLINE FOR YOUR OWN USAGE OF THIS MEDICATION. MEDS ARE DANGEROUS, PLEASE BE INFORMED ABOUT ANYTHING YOU TAKE~


Lyrica is a great med and I've found, personally, will halt opiate WDs in their tracks, NO SHIT. Of course, you have to snuff quite a bit of it for this effect, but I'm on 200mg of methadone daily for pain and when I run out, I immediately go to my Lyrica and start w/150mg x2 and I will also eat 2 as well. That's good for about the first hour but for safety I repeat the first snuff dose. 


Not only are there no WDs but I can actually sleep, which is miraculous as I, for one, am never able to sleep when in WDs or off my meds. Unfortunately, I can be a glutton in my rabid attempt to avoid the cursed WDs and it's not uncommon for me to kill a whole script for 60 Lyrica in like, 4 days. So at x15 a day, I fill it and never touch it until those last 4 days. 


I can sleep, am never dopesick, no aching, kicking legs, no sweats, anxiety or even diarrhea as Lyrica is also a bowel inhibitor, as opes are. I know this isn't entirely harm reductive and I certainly am NOT suggesting any of you try my use/dosing of the stuff. I've been on this drug for over 10 years now, long before it had been labeled a 'controlled substance' back when it was just said to 'produce drug seeking behavior'. Also, I know how much it takes for me to achieve the desired effect. It would most likely be a lot less for anybody else and  hell, I could probably get the same effects using a lot less, myself? But the nerve-pain relief is unbeatable and in my mind, the biggest bonus of all? NO DOPESICK is worth more than gold or being able to get in a size 2 pair of jeans.


Please bear in mind  that I post this conversationally =ONLY= it is NOT intended as a guide or suggestion for anybody else, merely a recollection of my experiences with Lyrica. If you are using it, please do tread lightly, especially until you know how it affects you. Read the literature that comes with your Rx, read up on it online at drugs.com or just plug the name into your favorite search engine and surf around the returns. More importantly than anything else, especially my or anyone else’s experience is YOUR OWN, as these meds affect folks differently, no doubt. 


So don’t just jump off into mega-dose land and follow my example, as my tolerance after all these years is phenomenal, unusual and uncommon.


Good luck, tread softly and always be informed~~

yes, this happened to me a few times at first when i switched from gabapentin to pregabalin. this can become *highly* unpleasant, to the point where i had violent muscle twitches akin to tardive dyskenisia brought on by antipsychotics. these days i know my pregab and it doesn't happen anymore, although at doses exceeding 900mg i will still get a noticable tremor sometimes.

i find pregabalin to be an absolute godsend from the pharm gods. i enjoy the effects on its own, but it mixes well with every drug i tried it, its anxiolytic and calming properties take away all the side-effects i hate about amphetamines and hallucinogens, it potentiates and synergizes wonderfully with opioids, benzos and GHB, it makes weed moderately euphoric and 'trippy'. the only drug it doesn't seem to like is alcohol, which it also potentiates quite a bit, but it's so easy to overshoot it with the drinking to the point where you're just drunk off your ass and hardly feel the pregab anymore.

regarding withdrawal, i jumped off 600mg/day taken for ~six months without any real ill effects. was a bit nervous, anxiety was up a bit and sleeping was more difficult (though even without chemical help possible) and generally the only gabaergic i ever quit that wasn't absolute hell. about the same i'd get from using, say, 60mg diazepam for three days in a row. but this is by no means indicative that it's generally an easy drug to quit, because i've read more than one story here where cold turkey pregab WD was a nightmare and even tapering was quite unpleasant.

I am rx'ed 900 mg's a day for severe nerve damage in my legs after a car wreck and 2 failed back surgeries... anyways I try to skip a day here and there to keep tolerance at bay but dammit my legs hurt too bad on the 2nd day off... Lyrica is a wonderful drug and can be very pleasant to use if your tolerance is not too high..that is the one thing about it..after 3 days of use the "high"  runs out. But the silver lining is that your tolerance also goes down fast too. Just by skipping a  few days I can get a very good buzz on 900mg's I have taken up to 2000 mg at one time and that is when I started dropping thing I was carrying and when I was in bed my legs and arms would suddenly jerk...it was very unpleasant!

I am at the end of a six month taper off of Lyrica, a drug I came to despise for turning me into an overweight zombie.  If you have been lucky enough to escape the withdrawal symptoms of Lyrica when quitting, thank the Gods, for they are hell on earth.  I tried to quit 450 mg per day use (prescribed for RED) cold turkey, and was incapacitated for two weeks with panic, anxiety, nausea, stomach pain, chills, sweating, muscle aches, itching and crippling exhaustion.  What was really terrible was that these symptoms never got better with time.  I finally had to go back on the drug, just to survive.  I started a very slow taper in January, removing 25 mg once a week if I could tolerate it.  I'm now down to 75 mg every other day, and hope to be rid of this beast in a few weeks.


Forums are full of horror stories about lyrica withdrawal.  I started lurking through this megathread and cringed every time someone talked about how much they loooooooved this drug.  If you are trying to stop using lyrica, the key is a long slow taper. I also recommend magnesium, fish oil, pedialyte to replace electrolytes, benadryl and herbal tea to help you sleep.

I'm sorry for the horrors you had with withdrawal symptoms. For me the withdrawal symptoms were mild. but I never went over the maxium day dose as I notice many here have done. Apparently some have terrible withdrawal symptoms while others do not. Its like that with every drug.

Me too.  Withdrawals were minimal.  I know so many people that have been on this drug and stopped (older people 65+) and had no withdrawals.  I think a fair amount have to do with the individual chemistry, and the psychosomatic effect of expected withdrawals due to excessive forum reading.  Hospitals LOAD up patients with gabapentin when they discharge due to alcoholism to mitigate seizure risk.  You would be surprised how many patients are on regular gabapentin and then have the doctors do a relatively quick taper (if they are lucky) and are fine.  


This is HR, and this is the cold truth, reading the internet over and over trying to find every single detail is not a good thing.  There is plenty of "street science" on how methadone is worse to be dependent on then heroin.  Yet, time and time again, they don't realize that by dosing in a controlled environment and titrating down under the care of a doctor can make the withdrawals practically non-existent.  Heck I have seen patients detoxed from 100 down 10mg a week and they are fine (that's not common but if it is requested by the patient it is done).  Therefore, one's expectations and beliefs on what they can tolerate does likely have a strong correlation on how they feel the withdrawals to be.  


I feel for any person in agony, but I am hoping this is one forum that isn't like many others where people all jump on the "horrors of any big Pharm" drug and let it proliferate with everyone.  


Bottom line is that some people may have more withdrawal than others.  I would venture to say that the one's expecting the worst withdrawals will indeed just have that...the worst.  Mine weren't much at all and I went cold turkey from 2400mg daily for Neurontin and 4k on weekends.  A few days later I was fine.  YMMV.

I felt compelled to register to share my experience with Lyrica. 


I was initially  prescribed 75mg twice a day for social anxiety. These didn't do much but I felt something. So I got the dose upped to two 150mg a day and really felt the kick. Definitely like being intoxicated and very enjoyable at that. However, as others have said after a few days those effects wore off and I just felt practically normal again and no different from before taking them. I will admit that I didn't give it enough time in this state to really determine if I may have benefited from other effects from the drug, but I stopped taking them because I was gutted at no longer having the buzz, which did seem to make me more talkative and sociable. 


No problem coming off them as I had only been taking them for under a month. After a few days I took two 150mg together in the morning and that kick was back, and again very enjoyable. It really seems to 'fix' my anxiety too and fixes a lot of things. So at the moment i'm taking them in that capacity, so in essence rather like a party drug. I must admit the last few days i've been taking it every day and still getting the intoxication effect and the confidence, and if that wears off and I feel unable to handle social situations again then I will probably have to accept that I won't be able to take them every day and just use for times when i'm due to enter a social situation or to have fun when I go out. But i'm cool with that. I just don't want to become too addicted to something that when taken every day is not actually doing much. I don't see the point in that.

Well you said it yourself; you take it daily as prescribed and feel the effects.  Some people, like me, do.  Also, don't punish yourself for feeling good.  If taken as prescribed daily, and you feel good, that's normal.  You aren't addicted to them; only dependent.  There's a huge difference between the two.  You physically depend on them to get the anxiety relief but you aren't drug seeking, taking more and more to get the same effect and spending too much time obsessing about the drug.  That's basically the difference between addiction and dependence...negative consequences.  So hopefully you continue to feel more confident and relaxed.  Be happy about it...

It can be **very dangerous** to cold turkey quit pregabalin. People have died because of respiratory issues after stop taking this medicine.


I notice a hugh drop in the release of scientific articles about pregabalin since one year. Does anybody know why? I read they are developing new VGCC's which are a 1000 times potent as pregabalin theoretically. Haven't been able to find any additional information about this, guess it's so confidential.


Btw, I am dependent on 600mg each day for neuropathic pain. Taking it for about 3 years now.

I am indeed happy about it. Like I say i've tried many of the known anti-depressants and what not, and they've all made me feel like crap, whereas this appears to be the drug for me. I'll continue to take it regularly again for now and monitor how I am and if it keeps working in the way I need it to. I've also heard a lot about weight gain which I really do not need and another reason I've been apprehensive about becoming dependent. Has anybody here had this problem?

It only worked every other day for me, but full effects only every 3 day. Both Lyrica and Gabapentin makes you put on weight. Mostly bloated waterweight so it's hard to avoid it.

That's exactly the way it seems to work with me. Sometimes I stop for about 3 days, take them again and the full effect returns. It's a great drug but the body builds up a tolerance way too quickly. 

Shame about the weight gain though. Yet another drug with great benefits but a huge down-side. So far I haven't put on weight but I do a lot of intermittent fasting which i'm hoping is counteracting it.

I would say it's OK (for me, at least) to stop dead if they're only taken on a recreational basis in the first place as you're not giving the drug enough time to get a hold, the problem of physical addiction of course mainly being due to prolonged use and suddenly stopping. I always taper off, it's really common sense.  But I didn't know about the respiratory aspect. So yeah, kids.. taper off sensibly! ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

You may struggle to find words, but in ways, you may feel more creative and productive as well.  results may vary.  


Regarding weight issues.  Just an alternative thought on this and NOT proven; rather just "bro science."  


Many bodybuilders are taking supplements supposedly marketed as "GABA" drugs as they find GABA may help with muscle building through various mechanisms (not sure exactly how...maybe an increase in the release of natural HGH).  So it is possible if you weight train properly, drink LOTS of water (to flush more water), you may find that you gain weight; but muscle weight.  So you can either get fat...or fit.

Just to chime in LYRICA IS MY FAVORITE PRESCRIPTION DRUG OF ALL TIME! I have a script for Dexedrine Spansules (brand name) and I get more excited about my Lyrica script. 


This is the most versatile substance! It's also the most euphoric and this is coming from an IV meth user.  Believe the positive reviews. I find it is very similar to DXM in lower doses, yet much more pleasant - I'm not a DXM fan -  and almost identical to a GHB/MDMA trip at 700mg and up (with no tolerance of course). Yet it also has an undeniably mild psychedelic quality. 


Unlike many, I see very little comparison to benzos or opiates here and fully believe Lyrica is more recreational of the three. Neurontin can't come close to the outrageous euphoria Lyrica provides when you get just the right dose. 


But getting the right dose is tricky. Undershoot it and you just feel very dissociated, overshoot it and you pass out for 12 hours. Once you find your sweet spot you're golden... but you have to give it over a week between trips. 


It's the best anxiolytic on the market too. But watch out for tolerance!

I´ve just started this drug for nervepain and anxiety and now taking 50+50 until I get up to 150+150 (about 4 weeks). When does the effect kick in for anxiety relief? I feel somewhat strange sometimes, like a funny flow is flushing through my body and I am dead tired in the evening...... Guess it wears off after some time?!

^ I felt the anxiety relief an hour after dosing. But the feeling strange part is the best way that I can describe my experiences with Lyrica.

That's a mighty slow taper. At 150mg you should notice anxiety relief within two hours. I don think I would notice 50mg

I tried 600 mg to start, 2 300 mg capsules. I thought it was very interesting and unique. Social inhibition was destroyed, very nice buzz. I didn't feel sedated like I was worried I might. Sex was great too.

Ok, so today I didn't take my Vicodin and in the morning I took 700mg of Lyrica and took another 700mg around 6:00.i feel very motivated and my pain is minimal. YAY! I have one problem though; I CANNOT pee!! I have to, my bladder is most definitely full. I just sat and tried for about 10 minutes. I turned the sink water in to a trickle hoping that would help me go. No such luck. I turned the water in warm and put my fingers under it. Still nothing! Does anyone else experience this? And if so, do you have any suggestions as to how I can get some relief?? Help!! Lol! Thanks in advance for any responses! DJ

I´ts one of the rarest side effects mentioned in the leaflet. I don´t have any other advice for you besides keep tying to pee ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) If you still cannot pee and it starts to hurt i suggest you see your doctor. Good luck!

Hey i take 4x300mg Gabapentin a day for neuropatic pain in my left leg. My doctor will now switch me over to lyrica. I hope my pain will improve from this medication. I will take it for chronic pain what should be the equivalent dose. Tomorrow i will get my first dose, and i want to get high one time from it. (even something compared to ethanol would be nice, because i cant drink and dont want to do drugs right now) I think about 500mg, i only get the 25 mg capsules, to slowly increase the dose so i dont have too many of them. what do you think would be an equivalent dose of lyrica compared to 4x 300mg gabapentin. Does lyrica have serious drawbacks compared to gabapentin, because the gabapentin works ok for me if i am not working. But when i walk or stand a lot (more then 60 min) the pain starts to increase a lot!

I've now upped my dose to 600mg a day a I am on a pretty great high all the time. Nice buzz. I find very few downsides to this drug, and I agree with the others saying it could be used as a party drug. I find the effects a bit like morphine but containing a huge kick of energy, similar to what is experienced on ecstasy or amphetamines and I have to be doing something all the time. They also make me much more extrovert, so coming from someone taking them for social anxiety they are certainly doing the job. On the downside I am experiencing a lot of memory loss and decreased sexual function, but being I am not in a relationship at the moment, who gives a shit. Amazing drug.

Not something I would usually take but in a moment of pain I  dropped 375mg first time, felt nothing for 2 hours, suddenly felt very tired and passed out for 4 hours, awoke to intense dizziness and difficulty walking, tried to go back to sleep and had a lot of closed eye visuals. passed out again, 12 hours after feeling effects I was still groggy and felt disconnected from my movements.

as an exp substance user I was surprised how strong the effects were, not really enjoyable though, a poor mans ket-ghb if you will. 

a few other experiences with low doses during stim comedowns helped to  really take the edge off , better than benzos and even restores your appetite. during comedown 75mg pregabalin and 5mg diaz gave the same sedating effects as 20mg diazepam.

very strange how differently people react to this drug, I  certainly wouldn't right  off  its recreational potential for some.

I'm down to 50mg per day (my Doc told me not to skip days, just to keep lowering daily dose) and I'm feeling so much better.  I'm in the process of getting my Masters degree, and a good friend recently told me how great it was to have me "back" this semester.  When I asked her to elaborate, she said that many of my friends had been concerned because I was so out of it before (while on 450 mg per day).  That I often seemed drunk (I stopped drinking alcohol years ago).  I'm so mortified, and I cringe when I think of stumbling around back in my lyrica days.   My Doctor also mentioned that effexor withdrawal is supposed to be a real bitch (I think he was trying to make me feel better by telling me that there was some stuff that is even worse than my hated lyrica).  So, I'll keep trying, and I'll let you guys know how it's going.  Love to everyone, and strength as well!

Do you feel any anxiety at all due to the reduction of Lyrica? I mean due to possible withdrawal effects? I'm taking 900mg/day atm, and started to wonder whether my anxiety spikes might be b/c of missed doses or waiting to long between doses..

I'm not feeling anxiety exactly.  All I can say is that I don't feel so emotionally dead.  However I wasn't taking Lyrica for anxiety, I was taking it for pain, and it did not help me with pain at all.  It makes sense that it is a drug that helps with anxiety, because it made me feel very flat.  The majority of my withdrawal symptoms were more flu like.  It has been a rough taper for sure.  Are you taking all 900 mg at once?  That seems like a pretty high dose for just once a day.  I could see how taking that much and waiting 24 hours ultralight cause some anxiety.  Are you trying to cut down or taper?  Or is lyrica working for you?

I am now on 100+100 (morning and evening) and slowly up to 150+150. I take it for both pain and anxiety and it seems to be working best for anxiety. My mood is lighter and I come out of the house more often and dare to meet people again. I have not felt flat, sad, drunklike or anything yet. The first two weeks I felt a bit strange, but that has disappeared. My memory still works fine and I can still drive. Even had a couple glasses of wine this weekend and didn´t notice anything ![:-)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I am under no circumstances telling anyone to discontinue taking a drug that might be working for them.  I can see how frightening it must be to read some of these posts, but most of the people here are having problems with the medication.  I have been on other forums that sing praises for lyrica. My biggest issue is that I was specifically told that there were no addiction or withdrawal issues with lyrica, and that is a big fat lie.  My life has been damaged beyond belief by lyrica, and I wish I could sue Pfizer for a billion dollars, and use the money to open a very luxurious spa to freely treat all of us who have suffered for as long as we need the help.  All Pfizer Executives and salesmen who pushed this drug would be forced to work as maids and staff, ready to give hour long massages whenever we, the VICTIMS, desire them.  I can dream, right?

I´m sorry to hear you have had such a bad experience with Lyrica. I´m glad you´re feeling better now and hope it will last. Seems to be working for some, but I also see many take it to get high. Hope I never experience that. How long have you been taking Lyrica and did you take 150 mg three times a day? My doctor never mentioned any addiction to this drug, but my psychiatrist did and I´m glad she did. I´ve read every post in this thread a couple of times and must say it scared me to death to start up with this drug and I delayed starting with it for a few months.

I think I might go even slower when it´s time to quit and reduce by 25 mg a week. Hopefully I only get some mild w/d if I get any. One thing is for sure: this is not a drug to take lightly!

I think it all comes down to body chemistry. I've taken Lyrica for pain for the past 6 months at 50mg 3 times a day  sometimes taking an extra and because of a mix up between my doctor and Pfizer I had to drop down from 150mg to 50mg overnight to keep from running out.  It's been 5 days now and I've only had mild w/d the first couple days. I'm kind of surprised really because I was expecting the worst since I've been mixing benzos and lyrica,  not recreational doses or daily (2-4 times a week)  since almost day one. 


When I was on my antidepressant I did a fast 1 week taper after being on it for a year and had no withdrawal while I read of others who have  a horrible time getting off even after months of a slow taper.

Picking up some lyrica tomorrow :D

Loved gabapentin so im rather excited to try lyrica. 

I was wondering, does lyrica have a time release mechanism?

as i've said in the introduction thread, i was on 1.5 grams of lyrica (and a klonopin and 4 1mg roofies), and now that I woke up after blacking out for an hour, i took another 1.5 grams and another roofie, and i couldn't be feeling better. i plan to go as high as 4 grams. i'm just feeling so good!


disclaimer: NOBODY should do what i'm doing, i'm an old user and my tolerance is really high. heed the warnings in here cos you  ight end up in a gurney if you do as i do.

I'm going on a trip to Greece on tuesday morning and I have been prescribed 10 mg Sobril (oksazepam; its almost the same as 5 mg diazepam). I'm now on 100+150 Lyrica and take my doses at 11, both morning and night. My flight is at 06:40 in the morning and I have to take my benzo 1- 2 hours before takeoff. Will I even notice anything but the usual, like a bit relaxed when I take it? I have taken one pill now and then before when I was anxious, but never after I started with Lyrica. Is it likely that the Lyrica will boost the benzo in these small doses and at this time of hour?

Hope to get some answers ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I have been on Lyrica for about a year. Im currently taking 100mg a day. Last night I took 200 mg and for the first time in a while I felt light and floaty. Bad thing is I have the shakes in my hands and feel slightly unstable on my feet. A pro however is it made me feel extremely horny. With 22 surgeries on my abdomenan in the past two years my sex drive is in the garbage. So this added benefit is unbelievable. So I tried it again today and took 200mg this morning and the same thing happens. Could this be a new answer to lack of sex drive! I swear when I went to the grocery store I was emitting pheromones because men were following me like a pack of wolves .

My sex drive has also increased a lot since I've started with Lyrica and I can still come! I see there's a lot who loses this ability along with the sex drive...........

I've been on Lyrica for 6 months and it killed my sex drive, and while I'm not sexually active I have pretty much lost all interest in masturbation.

If I take my 150 mg dose of Lyrica at 23:00 tonight and my 10 mg oksazepam (same as 5 mg diazepam) at 05:00 in the morning, will the benzo be boosted very much? I know it will be boosted, but not how much and I am a bit scared to be honest.......

Lyrica is a much more powerful drug and it's more the benzo that would be the booster. At high enough doses anyway.

Thanks for the reply! 

In which way will it boost the Lyrica? I don't feel anything when I take the Lyrica alone...... Don't wanna get high or "drunklike" when in the air or behave like an idiot ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png) Is 150 mg a high enough dose 6 hours before intake of the benzo to notice anything but the ususal when taking benzo alone? Sorry for all the stupid questions, but I'm a little anxious about this..... Half of the Lyrica will be out of my system after about 6- 7 hours when I take the benzo....

**gaba confusiin and withdrawak**


ok,  I'm just going to provide basics so maybe you guys could use the data to help me. 

for 7 years i was prescribed  gabapentin 600mg 4 times a day.  after trying lyrica once I fell in love.  being that I have a spinal injury I thought I would be a sure fire candidate for lyrica script.  so I asked my doctor and he obliged and have me a prescription for 75mg twice a day.  I found that rather small compared to my neurontin and note he replaced the neurontin with lyrica so no more neurontin. 


to my dismay,  the pharmacy sent me a letter rejecting the funding saying that I must first try cymbalta (i don't like ssri)  and 3600mg a day of neurontin to see trey work before considering lyrica.  

so i went back to my doctor and my intuition told me to ask him if he had any samples,  he came out with a bag  of 6sample bottles containing 14 75mg capsules each and said here this should last you two months.  it was like a party in a bag but at the same time I knew that I would be sol when they run out because I don't have any neurontin. 

so the addict that I am, I went through the whole bunch in 4 days.  I just Took the last twenty one pills and I'm freaking out.  I went through gabaergic withdrawal (namely neurontin for this discussion) and it was awful. 

my question based on what you know about my tolerance to those 2 drugs can anyone give me any pointers? 

my arsenal consists of 45mg baclofen daily.  I have enough klonopin to last about 2mg a day and   8mg suboxone a day.  can anyone help with a regimen using those meds I have namely the baclofen to help attenuate the neurontin /lyrica (gabapentin /pregabalin)  withdrawal?  should I maybe leave a message on the doctors  refill line asking for more gabapentin? he is also my klonopin dr so i don't want to fuck that up.  thanks in advance

Maybe you should go visit your doctor and tell him how it is? He would most likely know what to do and give you a regime so you don't get any nasty wd symptoms. Sorry I can't help you otherwise.

You will probably still feel your benzo being  stronger but by how much who knows. I mix lyrica and benzos  2-3 times a week and for me it takes around 2 hours for the lyrica to work so I always take it a couple hours before I plan to take my benzo. I almost always use 100mg of lyrica  for potentiation.

Ok this drug has finally pissed me off. After taking Pregabalin 600MG a day for over a month, I have decided to go back to my original plan of just using them in a recreational sense, or when I need a confidence boost. I'm sick of the weight gain (being a person who spent the last 12 months losing weight and felt happier for it, this is a real problem) as even intermittent fasting, drinking loads of water and eating very little isn't shifting it, whereas last year those methods quickly got me down to my ideal weight. I also now have completely zero sex drive (which by itself dictates that I cannot possibly realistically take them for the rest of my life, unless I wish to become a monk!). Above all I no longer feel the enjoyable effects as I did when taking it sporadically.

^^this pretty much sums it up for me, i continue to get lyrica prescribed because it so much more expensive then gabapentin, and my insurance coveres it. I will stock up on it, but continue to use it regularly and switch over to gabapentin 4x300mg. In fact i never stoped the gabapentin and took varieing amounts of lyrica on top (100-500mg). It works bad for pain, kills my sexdrive, increases appetite and make my mind dull.

 But still i have a hard time not using it, somehow it relaxes me. And i say to myself it make my pain better in the mornings if i take it in the evening. And i get a good nights sleep from 200mg (which is my sweet spot). And i have a short sleep since i quit opiates, benzos and thc.

I use 225mg of Lyrica per day it is 1.5 capsules of 150mg a day 3x75mg three times a day and it is pretty well. I take 2x50mg of pramolan too, both for GAD and depression. it seems fine.

Why is it a horrible drug? It works for me.... Only thing is that I'm struggling with short term memory loss some times. Other than that I feel normal. My neck pain has ceased and it seems to be working for my anxiety as well. 


I took 10 mg of oksazepam 1,5 hours before my flight boths ways and didn't feel any different from before. I got tired as usual and fell into a light sleep and felt relaxed. Nor Lyrica or the benzo were boosted in any way!

It’s effectiveness goes away very fast.

No withdrawal to speak off. Grams gone in a couple days...

acute use for "special" occasions is where this wonder drug shines


if it was up to me id call it " - BaseLine - "


chronic use, aside from actual neuropathy pain is a waste imo

This thread is pretty amazing now that I've gone back over it and really read it.  So many different experiences!


When I think back on first taking Lyrica, which at the top was prescribed for Reflexive systemic dystrophy at 450 mg a day, I do remember feeling spacey and more importantly, I lost all emotions, good and bad.  No anxiety, but also no joy.  No fear, but also no affection.  I didn't gain any weight for the first year, then BAM forty pounds! (eating less than I have ever eaten, because I was freaking over the weight).


For everyone who thinks that I had the level of withdrawal because I was expecting it, well the first time I went through cold turkey withdrawal, it was because I had run out over a weekend, and had to wait till my Dr was in to get a refill on Monday.  I became really sick with what felt like the flu.  I never even thought it was lyrica, since I had been told there was no withdrawal.  I just thought I was terribly ill.  This went on for two weeks, and I didn't go pick up my refill because I felt so awful.  My husband picked up my Lyrica prescription when getting one of his own.  I went ahead and took my normal dose, and felt so much better within an hour or two.  It was only then I realized I had been in lyrica withdrawal.  I know...I'm an idiot, but there it is.


I never took it to get high, or potentiate another drug, and I'm not criticizing anyone who does.  Hey, it's your life, your body, caveat emptor and all.


I just want my own experiences written down. Had I known what I would end up going through, there is no way in hell that that drug would enter my body.  It sucked balls.

I take 150mg of Lyrica 3x daily.  I've been on this dose for a couple months.  I'm curious to know how much it would take for me to trip on it again, something I haven't done since a few months ago.  I hate taking too little or too much of Lyrica.  Too little and it feels like a mild dissociative.  Too much and I pass out.  The right dose is incredible though!  If I take 450mg a day I'm guessing I will need a bit over 1,000 to trip.  What do you guys think?

I made a very BIG discovery today.  If you've read any of my posts, you'll know I have been desperately trying to get off Lyrica for some time, after using it for RSD pain at 450 mg per day for two years.  Even though I've been off Lyrica for a short time (after a long taper) I still had some lingering withdrawal symptoms, especially drenching sweats and exhaustion. I found some information about an amino acid available over the counter, called GABA (many of you BL's already are familiar with this).  After reading up on Web M.D. and a few other sites, I decided to try it.  GABA is analogous to Lyrica (chemically very similar).  It is believed to stabilize blood pressure, help your body burn fat, relax you, help you with anxiety, PMS, mood, pain...even ADHD!  It works to inhibit brain signals, which is also how Lyrica is believed to work.  There is some argument about GABA' s ability to cross the blood brain barrier, but the general consensus seems to be that a portion of it does cross over.  I drank some grapefruit juice before taking it, just in case.


I tried the recommended dose, and (drum roll please) it worked.  Better, by far, than anything else I have ever tried.  This is my experience, I'm only one person, maybe it was placebo (doubtful...I didn't get a placebo effect with anything else), but I am really, really happy, for the first time in a long time.


It cost around fifteen bucks for sixty pills, and the recommended dose is three capsules a day.  I don't know if this is the answer, but I'm so happy to be feeling normal.  Do some research, see what you can find.  I can't go so far as to recommend GABA...I'm not a Doctor, and I'm only responsible for my own body.  But for me, finally...FINALLY, some good news.


I also posted the same information on the website Neurotalk, so if you read posts there, You will get more information.  I'm just so relieved to finally have something good to report, other than the doom and gloom of my regular posts.  Bless you all for lending an eye and being there when everyone else in my life was SO over discussing my Lyrica issues.  Peace, love and good health to all!!! ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

The most remarkable thing about Pregabalin, for me, is that while tolerance builds fast, it also decreases with abstinence more quickly than any drug I have ever taken.  2-3 days without it, or at a reduced dose, and it regains power nearly 100%.  


An interesting side note:  Pregabalin does not potentiate benzos or opiates for me AT ALL.  It does, however, potentiate my daily dose of Adderall... yet I've also used it to practically kill a meth high when I've been up too long or taken too much.  It is almost as if it potentiates stimulants when I want it to and yet can also abort a high when I want it to.  


Pregabalin is just such a fascinating substance!  I truly believe gabapentin and pregabalin represent the first substances in what will prove to a long list of similar drugs that offer many novel therapeutic and recreational benefits.

This was actually a reply I made in another thread but I wanted to post it here to see if anyone could answer the question in it or if anyone had any interesting comments...


> Actually, it is a common misconception that Lyrica and Neurontin are GABAergic. They actually bind to voltage gated calcium ion channels and in so doing inhibit the production of excitatory neurotransmitters including Glutamate, Norepinephrine and Substance P. GABA inhibits these neurotransmitters as well, thus the similarity in effect. However, excitatory transmitters also typically inhibit GABA, so it seems reasonable to me that Lyrica, by inhibiting excitatory neurotransmitters, also increases the amount of available GABA. Can anyone offer any insight on this theory?

When you take an SSRI you aren't just effecting Serotonin, you are effecting every neurotransmitter which Serotonin effects and which are effected by Serotonin. The nice, simple ways people explain how drugs work are just that... SIMPLE! The brain is FAR from simple. I once read a marvelous quote; "If the human brain were simple enough for us to understand it, we would be too simple to understand it."

Hi guys, I'm a new user of Bluelight. I would like to know what kind of drinks make you high while taking Lyrica?

My cousin suggested me to take it with Redbull, and it did work. So what do you guys think about that?


I already know about alcohol effects, because I tried it once and it was a horrible experience.


Best regards,

Mohamed from Middle East.

Dark brown sodas.  I have no idea and this makes no sense but Coke, Pepsi, Dr. Pepper, etc... potentiate the hell out of Lyrica while Sprite does not.

I just took 1050mg of it with pepsi few hours ago, I'm just feeling a little drunk. I think tramadol or oxycodone are much better.

sure


potentiates it when you take the stim after an hour or two on lyrica (the I can sleep if I want to phase ![:-)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) )


and kills the stim only when on the comedown from it (dose dependant aswell)


also a factor is your mind state at the time. if you want to sleep after any still or psychotropic, nothing beats lyrica + xanax

So I know there is no way to give a definite answer here, but I wanted to see if I could get a general opinion.  I've been taking 450mg of Lyrica a day for three months.  What are the chances that abrupt discontinuation would cause withdrawal and how severe would the withdrawal be?

So this stuff can be IV'd. If so does it dissolve in a 1ml rig with 150mg of lyrica.

I've been taking high-dose morphine and dihydrocodeine (Vicodin in US?) since a helicopter crash twenty years ago. Really bad nerve damage in lower spine.

My doc put me on Lyrica a couple of weeks ago and I'm frankly amazed at the results. Poured honey into my spine, kicked my depression and helped with the opiate withdrawal. Problem is, I've had to triple the initial daily dose of 300mg to get the same effect. Wickedly short tolerance period.

Are you sure about the increase in efficacy after only a day or so off?

I'm willing to grit my teeth for that amount of time if I get back that amazingly smooth relief I experienced initially.

Not quite the miracle panacea I thought it was, but damn close.

No-one seems to know why it does what it does, but I see a lot of potential before it gets classified as a 'controlled drug' which it probably will. ![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif)

Anyway, can you confirm about the break?

Thanks mate.

I had my first dose of lyrica today. I only had 75mg however I am also on 160ml of methadone. Even on a dose of 75mg I felt very dreamy and very happy!

I will up the dose now. 

It goes really well with methadone. 

Happy customer.

Yes, a break for about 24 hours makes the feeling come back. If you have been using it daily for a long time then maybe 48 hours the first time and then 24 hours after that. I am in 300 mg every other day.

Just want to say it has been added to the standard list of drug tests here now. It was the substance at the bottom of the ones to be crossed off for an urine sample. Gabapentin wasn't there but is so similar it might give up a positive.

Which country is this. And a false/positive for what? 

Are you saying lyrica is now classed as recreational?

Yes. It's obviously now been classified as a substance for recreational abuse, which it always has been. Much more than benzos are. Scandinavia, but no doubt the rest of the world will follow, or have started following.


It might not come up as a false positive, but the substances are so alike they might be able to gather you've been using that as well. I now see you also can't order Gabapentin online without a doctor's prescription anymore. Guess the fun is coming to an end for many.

^ Through daily, therapeutic usage, you quickly build a tolerance to the recreational aspects of Lyrica, and it becomes useless recreationally over time, even in megadoses, unlike benzos, where there is no ceiling dosage even with extreme tolerance. Benzos should be schedule III, and Lyrica deserves its mild schedule V rating, all imo of course.


Anyways, I came to this thread to commend Lyrica on its usage as an opiate withdrawal aid: it's amazing! I take 300mg every morning, but taking 600mg for 3 days after w/d, then 300mg daily after that *really* helps with w/d symptoms, for the few days I was w/d'ing from PST and couldn't get my hands on loperamide. I finally picked up some Lope, and with that and PG-P inhibitors (WGFJuice, Lansoprazole, etc, to make the lope cross the BBB) and the Lyrica, it *completely* erased all my opioid w/d symptoms, and actually gives me a very mild, opioid like high.

Almost none. Fairly low dose for three months? A couple of days of anxiety, easily handled with 10mg of any benzo will hold you.

Pregabalin is a very unusual drug. It's not retained by the body at all. In initial tests they found that 95% of the drug was recoverable in the urine after 24hrs.

Any withdrawal will be purely psychological.

You're absolutely right! I've been taking high doses of morphine, codeine, and benzos for nigh-on twenty years now. I thought I'd never find anything to stop the terrible withdrawal every time I tried to quit. But pregabalin is like a miracle drug. It affects the same bunch of nerves in the lower spine, effectively cutting off the channels they use to 'speak' to the brain. These same nerves undergo an unnatural thickening with heroin and opiate use in general over time and they scream when you stop taking these opiates. Causing all the familiar withdrawal-symptoms.

150mg twice a day, and after only three weeks I no longer need the Vicodin.

This is not the case. Like other have said the very simple secret to recreational use is to take a day or two off. After 3 days tolerance seems to be gone completely.

What does that have to do with withdrawal?  Marijuana stays in the body for weeks but you don't have physical withdrawals from it.  Pregabalin being recoverable in urine doesn't mean it can't produce physical dependency.  I don't understand your logic here.  Could you explain a bit more?

Agreed.  Plus I take 450mg per day in divided doses, but if I take 600mg all at once I can trip pretty hard, without even skipping days.  Now if I take 600mg at once the very next day the effect will be greatly diminished.  


I wouldn't trade my Lyrica script for any benzo script, even flunitrazepam.  Daily benzo use truly does make them completely useless recreationally for me.  This is far from the case with Lyrica.  Besides, it is extremely therapeutic for me.

Sorry. I meant that pregabalin isn't metabolised at all. Unlight some drugs whos residuals cause actual physical dependance.

Is that any clearer? I'm rather new at discussions on forums of this sort. It's a slow way of explaining anything. :/

I'm back to taking it every few days and as others have said it leaves my system in 24 hours, and when i take it again a day or two later.. boom. 300mg Knocks me for six. I don't even think I could handle more than that in one go. I usually get away with two days of taking 300mg and getting a proper hit before the effects dissipate rapidly thereafter. But i'm happy with this arrangement as I also experienced massive short term memory loss when I was taking it every day. My life is in enough of a mess, I didn't need to be adding to it with unpaid bills and missed appointments!

Sorry, but I have to ask too about getting off this drug. I started taking it in june (started at 25 mg at night) and increased the dose slowly up to 150+150 which was in august (and my final dose). Now I want to quit taking it because of the cost and I find it a difficult drug to combine with simple drugs as ibuprofen. On saturday I quit 50 mg morning and night, but how many days until I can cut down again and will I get any nasty w/d? The sooner I'm off this the better. Also wondering how much more I can/ should cut down the second time?

This is a strange comment but don't mind me. I was reading up on pregabalin and learned that 90% of it passes unmetabolised In urine. That's a lot that can be recaptured so long as you don't mind drinking your pee ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png) but seriously, drinking your urine is a generally safe practice, just read a bit about it and follow some guidelines. I thought I'd throw that out there for anyone desperate  about to go into WD and just took the last of their Lyrica. I know how bad the withdrawal can be!!!

I have a decient tolerance to benzos and z drugs. I also have sciatica, on top of clonazepam and Ambien. Over a five hour period, I took exactly 51, 75 mg capsules ( the next day I counted what was left). That equals 3,825 mg in on night. During the dosing period, I went through the happy/ high, double vision, etc. Near the end, it felt pretty close to Ketamine in my honest opinion. If you pull that shit once, you won't have a major tolerance issue. Possibly a minor one.

I forgot to mention the word Lyrica in the last post. The point is I like to have fun now and then, hence the high dose, but at a 150mg dose daily, the pain is almost completely in check,  I can take that dose for a long time and withdrawal with almost zero symptoms. Excellent medication.

This drug, along with gabapetin can have nasty WDs if taken daily. The best thing is to take at least 48 hours off for everyday that you use. For instance, take some, take two days off, dose again, two days off. Occasionally you can do two consecutive days, and use soda and ibuprofen (or any NSAID) for potentiation on the second day. If you keep to this, then you will find that the WDs are very mild and not as horrific as some have reported. This is based on my experience.

I currently take Gabapentin 300 X3 for anxiety. It seems to work quite well. However, I've never tried Lyrica. Is Lyrica something I should ask my doctor about?


Could anybody provide some reasons as to why Lyrica works better? They seem like the same thing to me when I read about them both.

Gabapentin 900mg./day is a rather weak dose; I'm glad it works well for you! This corresponds to Lyrica 150mg./day or 75mg. X 2.


Yes, I believe pregabalin (Lyrica) [Pfizer] to be a superior compound, but since the low dose of gabapentin is working well for you, I would try to keep your tolerance to gabapentinoids as low as possible so you can receive the maximum possible benefit for the greatest length of time and switching to a stronger compound may interfere with tolerance. If you develop a tolerance to gabapentin, you always have the option to switch to Lyrica. If you switch now, you don't have that option down the road. Also, Lyrica may not be as cost effective.


Gabapentin does have some things to talk to your doctor about: Horizant ER (gabapentin enacarbil which is a transported prodrug of gabapentin with almost twice the oral bioavailability in a pill form that once swallowed undergoes enzymatic conversion to gabapentin, and transport by intestinal solute transporters for an estimated 24-hour dosing period) [XenoPort]; and Gralise (gabapentin in a pill that once swallowed swells in gastric fluid due to polymer technology which provides a 24-hour release) [Depomed]. I first suggest Horizant. Its max dosage is 1,200mg., and the enacarbil form increases gabapentin's bioavailability significantly. If you need up to 1,800mg., consider Gralise; proceed, once you need a dosage above 1,800mg., to talk to your doctor about Lyrica.   


Good luck, and I hope you continue to get an anxiolytic response!

Do any of you guys get huge circles under your eyes after taking lyrica at night? I've just been represcribed this and usually take my dose before I go to sleep. I swear, not even exceeding 100mgs, I wake up and it looks like I haven't slept at all, haha. It looks even worse than if I hadn't slept to be honest. 


I don't remember this happening last time, and I'm not on any other meds either.

I am on Lyrica for some level of fibromyalgia. I have taken upwards of 2 g's and if I felt like I was on a nice dose of K. I however don't want a crazy tolerance, let alone beating on my internal organs. I have experience with GABAgerics and other downers. Point is 300mg's to 900mg's a day should make any psychonaut happy.


To the last couple of posters, this is not in any particular order, but, I have had darkness under my eyes and sometimes some yellowing around my eyes. Second, I started with the gabapentin thru my psyche doctor, and it was okay, but I had to eat a shit ton to have it work and it mainly fogged me out. It was too blunt. Then I went to a PCP and I was able to give me lyrica for nerve pain, even though it was a better version of gabapentin . The to docs at the same hospital, were unable to understand what the connection was. In my opinion, lyrica is very closely related to gabapentin and it gets to the right receptors in the brain more effecently. Lyrica is very strong. If you understand it and respect it's power, whoever uses it will have absolutely no problem with it. Treat it like a benzo and you can keep the WD's at bay. Sorry for the ramble, I'm on pain meds. I just found out that I have Hogkins Lymphoma malignant, whatever the fuck that is. Peace and Love.

300mg a day keeps my nerves on cloud 9. Surprised how well it works even after 9 months. I'm also on about 6mg of suboxone a day so that helps put the rest of me in a good place. 

Whenever I add a little MXE into the mix, I may as well be in heaven.

I first tried Lyrica for recreational purposes, after researching experiences on erowid, etc i found that 300-450mg would be a suitable dose for first time user. I would have consumed around 12 beers and insufflated/taken about 5 (150mg) Lyricas that night, didn't give much of an effect that i was expecting, although i don't remember too much. 


The next experience was a few weeks later when I parachuted 450mg and insufflated 300mg about half an hour later. I consumed 5mg of oxycondone also further on in the night. I would tend to stumble a little when i walked, although if it came down to it i could normally. I was more chatty than usual to my friend who i was with.


My third and final recreational experience i railed 2 300mg lines simultaneously (600mg). Once again i would tend to stumble and reading things on the computer screen was a little fuzzy.


Through all the experiences my mood was 100% and i had zero anxiety, although I couldn't say i was 'high' off them, at all. I was very comfortable after i had these. music was enjoyable. Falling asleep in a pitch black room was pleasant. I'll also state that I'm a 17 year old male and i have high tolerance to quite a few things. I only plan on using Lyrica's again to help with my social anxiety when it comes to being out with unfamiliar people (300mg doses).

i'm so glad i found this...


i love lyrica. i get it as part of my pain regimen - 40 mg dilaudid daily, 350 mg soma bid, 4-6 mg of alprazolam and a whole lot of psych meds that have nothign to do with this post except focalin 5 mg bid - 60 of the 300s a month. over the course of a year, i've figured out a pill combo platter that i love. i wouldn't recommend it; the dosages are kinda nuts, and i know it's probably deeply in the not too bright category of my personal decisions about my drug use. 


i take approx. 3000 mg of lyrica. actually, i just take a handful and eyeball it. i'm guessing. with that, 6 mg of alprazolam -- 3 X 2 mg sticks. 40 mgs of focalin, usually oral. 16 mg of dilaudid iv. 5 or 6 soma. 


sounds nuts... actually, seeing it written out, i'm thinking suicidal makes more sense. but the buzz is the only thing i've ever experienced that rivals a perfect intravenous speedball. however - not unlike w/ a speedball - this is the kind of high where some kind of accompanying activity is not only not enhanced by the drugs, just getting out of your chair is generally a bad idea. 


make sure you go to the bathroom before this one.

Yes, all those depressants are a bad idea. Really bad idea. Also, eyeballing lyrica to the point where you take approx 3g of the med is ridiculous. 


BEing a harm reduction forum, I dont suggest anyone else follow suit.

Hi all. Been a while since my last post, but just had to post about this med.  


I suffered a Spinal Cord Stroke in July2012.  This left me with nerve damage in both legs, very top to the soles of my feet. Also tremendous lower back pain. This event left me in a wheelchair for the first 8 months.  I have worked myself into a walker since then, and am practicing with a cane for the past 2 weeks! I take a total of 45 mg morphine, 30 mg percocet, 600mg tramadol, 30mg baclofen, and 450mg lyrica.  a day, and have been since being released from the hospital/rehab in October 2012.  


What I have discovered is that all of these drugs have great synergy with one another.  More importantly they are continuing to  work for me although I think I need to go up to 60mg morphine since it has begun to lose a little of  its effectivness. 


The most lyrica I have taken a one time was 900mg.  But honestly I would/will not do that much again.  For me a 600mg dose is tops and not at one go but rather a 300mg dose followed by 150mg and then another 150mgs a few hours later.  This takes away all of my neuropathic pain, puts me in a great, and very satisfying mood while giving me some fantastic sleep.  Going to need to mention going up to 600mgs a day I guess!

This is spot on. Literally taking a few days off Lyrica (and that includes gabapentin, alcohol, benzos) will help maintain that recreational high, and also not have you go through WD. I, against my own advice and common sense took four days of lyrica and on day five I was quite uncomfortable. So the key is to take days off.

I am currently going through lyrica withdrawels (i was on the max dose 600mg T.I.D) I honestly think these withdrawels are more mentally fucked than benzos and heroin (heroin is of course worse physically. and u dont crave it like u crave heroin. Though I was craving pretty hard)

Lyrics is an amazing drug in my opinion and very helpful with the w/D's from opiates/opioids or alcohol.nerontin(gabapentin)is helpful as well but lyrica is much more potent.I was w/d from opiates one day and my mom told me about lyrics and how one of her nursing home clients were asking her for some that day so I asked her for a few with her having knowledge of my w/ds.she gave them to me and I took six of them(450 mugs) and. Felt great 30 minutes later with lots of energy.never really used them enough to get addicted..just every once in a while for emergency use as as last alternative.don't want to replace one addiction with another.I just set up this account and this is my first post so any input(information)would be very helpful.thanks so much.

Im brand new to lyrica and took 150 mg an hour and a half ago because I'm nervous! Just took another 75 since I don't feel anything. Am I wasting my time if I stay at a low dose.?I'm nervous about losing control completely. Im back to recreational fun after a long absence and feel very out of the loop! Anyone think its ok to try 300 for  a first time if I'm brand new and don't use other substances anymore? This is also my first thread-please bear with me! Thanks!

Thanks so much. I have to just suck it up and not be so nervous. Its a sample bottle so nothing to lose!  Thanks again Rybee!


I totally didn't dose correctly or I don't metabolize this well. I spaced out 75 MG   capsules at 150 first since  I'm new, then 2 hrs later another 150. The first 150 on an empty stomach. At this point I'll try 1 more but im hoping it doesn't catch me by surprise at once! Next attempt needs better planning. I think I read too much about it and had too many expectations!  Stay safe everyone

Not sure about the pregab. wd's as i have run out early almost EVERY time, 10 days this time,  but have not exp any wd's at all, none, nada.  I am  also on morphine er, oxy, and tramadol so maybe that kept me from feeling anything?  Also i have been on pregb since 11/2012.

Although I didn't get the result I expected, I slept beautifully for the first time in a year. I woke up 15 hours after initial dose feeling pretty good. I slept about 10 hours without my usual anxious awakening  every few hours. Will have to try again with a larger initial dose.

My body must be wired weird because I've been on lyrica for a year and a half ranging from 100-150mg  a day for the first year and 100-300mg a day for the last 6 months and I have no problem skipping a day or two. I did have about a week long  mild headache about 7 months in to it when there was a mix up between my doc and the pharmacy and  I had to drop down to 50mg from 150mg but other than that I didn't have any other issues. 


Edit: I DO have some  anxiety and  depression but I also  vape weed daily, take temazepam at night and kratom on average 3-4 times a week.

What dose of Lyrica do you take. I talked to my doctor and she automatically kicked my pills up. I took a 1g + dose and felt like I was on K. The point is you should be able to get some relief between 300mg and 900 mg.

 I also take low dose amitriptyline 50 mg, and it definitely works with the lyrica . With Lyrica, you almost have to pre load with the Lyrica. Take some, wait an hour, take some more. Once you hit the sweet spot, it lasts a long time. There is a chance that the tramadol is inducing some enzyme that burns your Lyrica off quicker. 

You said you take tramadol. I have oxy to work with. I'll post my findings later.

You do realize that urine is your body's way of eliminating things like excess salts and ions, environmental toxins, and cellular waste? 


Drinking your own drug filled piss to get a buzz is not a smart thing to do.If you absolutely are going to do it anyway, make sure to consume a good amount of water before hand so it is as dilute as possible...

Hey peeps, had a read of the first few pages of this thread and the last few pages to get a better understanding.


Having a clear out of my bed side table where I keep my meds and just found some Lyrica ~6 months old. 


I used to take it for 3 things migrane prophylaxis/general anxiety/sciatic pain but hated the stuff (cognitively constipated, couldn't think or talk properly) so tapered off pretty soon after and moved to Dosulepin is much an old Tricyclic Antidepressant that also 'treats' all 3 of my issues (used to be called Dothiepin, no longer licensed in the US). Thus I only have some 25mg pills that I used for tapering. I have found 32x25mg = 950mg in total. Just checked my repeat prescriptions online and they've been taken off my repeats so there's no chance of getting any more. 


I hated them so much, I couldn't bare to think of abusing them since they just made me feel awful. The withdrawal was worse than Fentanyl, and worse than Venlafaxine (Effexor - a selective serotonin norepinephrine re-uptake inhibitor, sounds lame but it was torture, anyone who's experienced it can vouch for how horrible it is, I'd take diazepam withdrawals over both of these any day).


Not too long ago I took I took 24x25mg tabs = 600mg during the evening (7PM) after reading some good stuff about acute term abuse (even though they're considered a low risk abuse drug by big pharma) and felt nada, nothing, zilch. So went to bed ~6 hours later during the night. Woke up fairly early at 7AM busting for a piss and got out of bed and couldn't control my legs/feet at all. Lost all my coordination and had very distorted vision. I no longer drink but felt incredibly drunk, very dozy, an just completely out of it. Weirdly I quite liked it, felt very funny. The onset seemed incredibly slow, as said, I was up for 6 hours after taking them and felt nothing. But boy had they hit me in the morning. Others in this thread have reported the onset within 6 minutes, so I can't work out how it took so long?


What's the best use for taking them? Are they best on their own, best to potentiate other drugs, or to be used in conjunction with a potentiator? 


As said, I've got 950mg left so could probably do 2x doses of 425mg, or just 1 dose of 950mg. What's best? Is there much difference? 


Due to the sheer quantity of pills, insufflation is out of the question, oral is obvious, again, I think plugging is out of the question, just way too much powder with the 25mg pills. Maybe if I had the 150mg's it'd be more viable?


Usually use opiates (Fentanyl/Morphine/Oxycodone/Tramadol, and if desperate Codeine) and benzos (Have used most of them now, but only have a large quantity of Diazepam on it's way to me, and have 14x1mg Lorazepam tabs left now) Would it be good in combo, with any of these, or better on their own?


Any tips on getting the most out of them would be good. Just kinda put off by the fact that they took so long to kick in last time, so I was probably asleep whilst they were most active.

Lyrica is a lot of fun. Although I had a strange experience once, I've gotten mostly positive results. 


the "strange" experience was my fault, taking a 300mg dose after being off of GABAergics for a few years was probably not the best call. even then I just felt really weird, nothing like I was expecting and even a little panic inducing originally. I remember it pretty vividly, I managed to just 'ride it out' so to speak for the rest of the night, not entirely unpleasant but a little off-putting to say the least.


The rest of the time I spent with Lyrica over those next few weeks was great. A drug to try at least once if you have the chance, for sure.

I would recommend two doses with about two weeks in-between for the best results. Almost 1g of the stuff is too much for someone who is not a habitual user. 


The BA of lyrica is roughly 90% orally. There is simply no other way you should take them other than via your mouth. 


Lyrica potentiates opiates, and synergises with benzos, therefore if you want to feel high on just lyrica alone, do not take either of them. As to which is best, its really up to you, I am allergic to opiates (or something) so I dont take them, I take etiz sometimes but if taken with Lyrica I just fall asleep for about ten hours. 


To get those most out of them take them first thing in the morning on an empty stomach and don't eat anythign for an hour. Then after that hour is up have a black coffee....and in two hours you'll feel it.

Yeah I've split the dose. Took 16x25mg tabs (~400mg) an hour ago and am really feeling it. 


Slurring like mad, not had any in ages. Just went to the kitchen to get an drink and can't walk straight.


Not taken any in ages, good fun!

God this has really hit me hard.


As said, I didn't enjoy it last time and felt nothing. I've not mixed it with anything as I wanted to see what it's like on its own. I need to get this back on my repeat prescriptions for migraine, instead of dosulepin/dothiepin!


Used to take 400mg daily, (built up over months) but taking 400mg in one go after 6 months of not taking it seems very enjoyable.


Feel a bit drunk, drowsy, uncoordinated, but very content and snuggly in bed. It's a very nice feeling. 


This post has taken me 15 minutes to write lol.

Ha ha, glad you liked the high, its very nice, but only occasionally as the tolerance builds really fast if you take it daily. 


Listen to some music, Lyrica makes music sound AMAZING. 


Be careful with your co-ordination. I have fell in the bath, walked into doors, driven onto the pavement by taking it. I do not recommend you drive on Lyrica. Just putting that out there. What I did was stupid.

I don't know the answer but some swear if they miss a single dose they'll get hit with withdrawal while I can skip a day easily sometimes two without much (if any) discomfort. I haven't tried going  longer than two.

I can see how people compare this to Ecstasy.  I can't remember how much I took, would have been somewhere between 150-450mg with no tolerance and listening to YouTube on headphones was like being in a rave in my living room. Another time I took about 300mg at work and I was really outgoing and sociable, although I had trouble sleeping that night and it was bringing on the jaw grinding you get from E.  The effect went on a bit long that day.  I was taking it at least a few times a week, maybe more but not in crazy doses, and although I did notice a bit of tolerance creep in, it faded within a couple of days abstinence.

I used to take 150 mg b.d.


I took my AM dose at ~9AM and my PM dose a ~3PM. If I missed my PM dose I'd start to feel like I had the flu at 5PM. I don't know whether that's pretty unique but I felt the actute withdrawals kick in in very fast. They made me feel very awful and I just couldn't keep up with this so  I had to withdrawal from them immediately. Awful, awful drug if it's just not for you - I don't tolerate many drugs very well, Pregabaln, Gabapentin, Amitriptulone, Nortriptyline, Dosulepin... Brilliant drug if you respond to it well. Terrible drug if you don't.

Thanks for the answers Rybee, Aura Lee, Snake eyes. And just as is the case with these drugs, the answers vary! What applies to one doesn't always apply to another. I have gone up to seven days, and not felt anything. Not sure if I need to wait longer than that. I've also find no cross tolerance with gabapentin, which I also take. 


Having read SO MANY horror stories about this drug, in the mind

frame to get rid of the prescription and not look back, even if for now I am not feeling the WDs. But wondering if I need some kind of a stash just in case to taper off.

I'd also like to mention  that I've been taking lyrica daily (minus the day off here and there) for 1.5 years with the first year being from 50-200mg a day and the last 6 months 100-300mg a day so I am obviously  dependent. I'm also dependent on temazepam if that makes a difference. If you are in the position to build  up a stash for an if needed slow taper I would. I have a huge stash of both already built up  to taper as slowly as I need to go.

i guess i have been very fortunate in my use of lyrica.  i have been taking this med since 11/2012 at 300mg daily for 4 months before moving up to 450mg a day.  i am also on 60mg of er morphine, 600mg tramadol,  40mg of percocet, and 30mg baclofen, all daily.  it seems that i constantly run out of my lyrica early each month, usually a week early.  back to my opening statement, and i have not had any wd's that i have noticed...no craving, no depression, no nothing.  i have to believe it is due to the opiates i am taking that i feel no wd's from the lyrica.  this make sense to any of you folks?  whatever the reason though, im just happy that i have no problems!


btw, i am prescribed the above meds for a spinal cord stroke i had in 07/2012.  an incomplete stroke it left me with enough feeling to feel the pain, back down to the soles of my feet.  i only had to be confined to a wheelchair for 8 months and i now use a walker which i will probably be using for the remainder of my life.  i am able to drive and live on my own, things for which i am immensely grateful.


any thoughts about my question much appreciated.

24 hours they start. anxiety first. then some strange depersonalisation and derealisation. then you hit full withdrawal the on 48 hours. sweating, shitting everywhere, pissing all the time, overactive colon, overactive central nervous system, depression. etc. 


please visit [this](https://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads/531159-Lyrica-Withdrawal) thread and follow my advice regarding lyrica withdrawal. i've been through it more times than i can count on my fingers.

Just got some samples today. 6,2 and 180lbs. Planned to take 450mg when I get off work.


Tips, suggestions, etc? I already know this is a recreational dose and to not leave my house and just make it a night off.


Thanks for any feedback

Oh one thing I usually forget to mention on Lyrica threads; gave me the worst constipation ever. My bowels just do not move when I take pregabalin. This has resulted in anal fissures, which is basically tearing of the inner lining. Akin to shitting glass. 


TheDudeAbides: Take it and listen to music. Similar ot MDMA. Enjoy your first dose. No other time will ever come close to it.

yes, it works to some extent. but it won't be as potent as your first dose. pregabalin tolerance rises quicker than any pharmaceutical drug.

I have to admit I use mega doses of gabapentin or pregabalin during Kratom withdrawal. Works like a charm. Very trippy. Keeps on going for me, I thought first time only too but I take giant doses all day. I am **not** recommending this for the sake of harm reduction.

I disagree based on my experience with it. It does drop, but certainly not at the same degree it climbs and when it does drop in say a weeks time of abstinence, it goes right back to where it was within a single recreational dose. 


Anecdote aside though, let's assume for the arguments sake that it does drop just as quickly. What's more beneficial for the non recreational user, someone who doesn't just use it every once in a while, a slow rising tolerance or one that drops quickly? Time and time again I've seen medicinal users (of both gabapentin and pregabalin) complain about the tolerance of these drugs so I would certainly choose the former.

**lyrica bromo dragonFLY suboxone xanax klonopin neurontin vrooooooooooooom**


Ok I tried to read most of the mega threads but it became almost impossible. Im on an ultrahigh dose of bromodragonFLY. For those of you who dont know it is an extremely potent seratonergic hallucinogeon that has amphetamine like affects mixed with lsd. It lasts up to 72 hours and 1mg is a high dose. I took 4. So as I peaked it became so hardcore i needed someone to come help me out to make sure I didnt kill myself inadvertently. I started spasing out and my aunt gave me 300mg of lyrica. I downed them and 5mg klonopin, 4mg xanax, and 1.2g neurontin. Oh yah and eight mg suboxone. That is total as of now. BUt I felt miserable nearing the end of the peak. Almost suicidably miserable. I cant believe Im even typing. But after I took the lyrica I found the most bizzarre sense of clarity and beautiful crystaline OEV's. Before I forget, please nobody do what I did, I have a large amount of experience with psychedelics and bromo is very dangerous. Also my benzo tolerance is ridiculous It makes me so angry how much I can take to even get a nod. But there is something about the lyrica and the bromo that I never felt with any other drug or combo and Ive done almost everything. Of course not everything but MORE THAN YOUR AVERAGE JOE. It feels beautiful .,.. The benzos are making it feel even better. But I wonder if anyone else has an experience like mine of mixing with psychedelics? 

Also I have a huge daily neurontin habbit, but it did not seem to influence the dose of lyrica I took. I just recently swallowed a couple 600mg neurontin and I can feel the synergy already. I have a beautiful warm feeling radiating up through my spine. My only complaint is Im feeling a headache starting to develop and a headache on such a long lasting drug like bromo is nightmarish. I hope that lyrica has no evects on vasoconstricion becaues if it does I may be losing some limbs. 

Im sorry for being all over the place, but It is almost impossible to communicate right now. To talk is like following a time line in one direction and i feel like all time is just all happening all right now. I know it doesnt make sense but on a heavy duty psychedelic it makes plenty of sense. I think time is an illsion. Oh man I better stop typing the letters keep tilting at a 90 degree angle, then cycling through various colors, then changing direction. And my chair keeps feeling like its tipping backwards. One thought Im trying to get out is will the neurontin in addition to the lyrica I took just be like adding more lyica? Oh wow euphoric rushes. This is crazy. It turned a completely evil drug (bromo) into a wonderful mda like experience. 

I cant believe though people compare lyrica to mdma. I think mdma is the standard that all euphoria should be held up to. I dont think there is more euphoria than pure mdma. Which is making me wonder if they still sell it, because from what ive been reading lately it doesnt look like it. The pills from 99 or so ,m you cant match it. For those who know what i mean, you know what I mean. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png) 

But yes this is a WONDERFUL drug for smoothing out a trainwrecked trip (IMO) and I am completely treating myself as a guinea pig. I saved one lyrica to shoot because I saw someone mention it in the first thread and said it was sublime. Is there truth to this? I dont want to cnfuse myself more than I already am. Because I am whatever I say I am and if i wasnt then why would i say I am . jp.

This 1s flew over the cookcoos nest.

Please reply Ill check back.

LOVE AND RESPECT BL!

I think what you're experiencing is the net effect of combing too many drugs and the joy of lyrica mixed with benzos. It has a whiff of recklessness about it especially in the dosages so I'll certainly stay away. No hr to see here.

For me, this was the situation. If I accidentally missed my afternoon dose I'd feel influenza-like symptoms come on quite quickly by the early evening, it was horrible, insufferable even. That, and the fact it just constipated my clarity of thought, were the 2 reasons I had to come off of it.

Interesting you say that, because this was **very** prominent for me but not many other people have mentioned it. Whilst I could put up with the temporary anxiety, shakes and sweats, it's the de-realisation and almost psychotic state it put me in that was by far the worst. I felt totally out of touch of reality, which was pretty dangerous when driving back from work in the evening if I left my meds at home and missed my afternoon dose.

Taking 900-1200mg of Lyrica in a day is insane and is just asking for problems. Please remember, this is harm reduction. Not "lets get high" forum. 8)

^great advice. i've seen people get really fucked up from overdoing their first dose. plus it jacks up your tolerance unnecessarily which is the last thing anyone wants on pregabalin.

difficult to say really. i've done away with it for 4 months. used it for 2 days and felt like shit again when i stopped which triggered my dependency on it again. that's usually how i end up back on it. i wait for extended periods of time thinking there's no way that withdrawals can come back but they always find a way to creep up up on me.

I am prescribed 150mg x2 a day. So I get 60 of em to blow through when I get them. They dont help me much for pain, and the stuff causes weight gain, so I kinda just prefer to keep it as a recreational thing. Haven't really experienced wd yet from it, doing this ~5-6 months now. I just have other tools to help keep me stable without the lyrica.


I am curious about alternative ROAs for this stuff. I've read of nasal, rectal and IV... but what about vape/smoke?

Professor, your post made me wonder how many people, taking lyrica,  actually get pain relief?  I'm on the pain relief side.  I have neuropathy in both legs and lyrica definitely relieves the "pins and needles" and the "burning" that I feel.   I take 150 mg's three times a day. I did try three at one time about 2 weeks ago.  I thought to try a different roa. It was still oral but I opened the capsules, dumped the powder into a folded sheet of stiff paper, poured it in the back of my mouth, washed it down with some water, and promptly fell asleep.  Not going to try that again, at least not  3 caps at once!

With an over a 90% BA its simply wasteful to take it any other way. a good think about lyrica is the way that it makes you come up, it doesn't just hit you suddenly and you are high, its a gradual process and thats part of the fun.


I also took it for pain, and it did help but I was too scared to take it every day for feaer of addiction that I just used it recreationally.

Hi guys! I've never posted in this thread, but let me say, I LOVE Lyrica. Through some quirk (I have medicaid), I ended up getting brand name Lyrica from Pfizer, and it doesn't help my pain whatsoever. I'm prescribed 100 mg 2x a day, so I have 6g to burn through monthly. Like I said, it doesn't help my pain, so every week or so (generally), I'll just take 1.5 g of Lyrica and be high as gas all fucking day, come home around 3 (I wake up at like 5), crash suuuuuper hard (people cant wake me up), grab my dinner out of the microwave, and sleep very well that night. Am I the only one who takes amounts like that? I also do it orally, oes. Can you OD from Lyrica?


I'll add that almost every time I drop acid, I eat about a gram of lyrica at the same time, since it takes a little bit to hit you. The next twelve hours, not only am I seeing colors, but I'm floating on a cloud, baby %)

Do any of you guys have experience with redosing during recreational use? 


Took 300mg about 2.5 hrs ago and not feeling much. It was on a full stomach though. I've felt great from it before but not sure if it's kicked in or still waiting for it. 


Would it be a waste to go for a redose?

For me it takes a while for withdrawal to come on (more than one missed dose). I don't use it recreationally as I'm supposed to take it everyday so it just makes me dizzy at high doses, without tolerance tolerance 300mg should be ok, I would go up to 450mg maximum (don't take 600mg without tolerance you'll be so out of it and unable to think). Mind you it's only an anticonvulsant FFS (recreationally it feels cross between a weak opioid and that dissociative dumbing effect), goes best with some alcohol.

I am also prescribed Lyrica( I believe im taking 100mgs 3x a day, although I could be slightly off on those numbers). I agree with your post with one exception. I don't believe that recommending alcohol to enhance the effects of Lyrica is a very good idea. Of course if he mentioned that he was already planning on doing that then giving advice on how to do that in the safest way possible would be fine(if not highly recommended). But given the dangers/risks involved with mixing alcohol with almost any psychoactive drug(not to mention the dangers of using alcohol by itself), I wouldn't recommend it to anybody in the interest of harm reduction.

I found that the first dose is the one that counts, any kind of redoing will just end up muddying the high and there is little euphoria. IMO a waste.


EDIT: never mix alcohol with lyrica, not only are they both CNS depressants, a few drinks and some lyrica will give you a dirty hangover. Not worth it.

Hmm well I beg to differ, the effects of a couple glasses of wine and pregabalin (when used recreationally about 300mg without tolerance) go together quite well imo, i'm not recommending you get shitfaced or anything of course that would be stupid.

There could be a non-member, pregabalin-naive person reading this and think its okay to do this as a first experience. Some stupid kid who found their mothers pills, wanting to get high etc. 300mg for you or I, (both prescribed to take it daily) is one thing, for someone with zero tolerance this is a powerful drug to mix with alcohol. Do not down play it.

Hi Im a newbie here as far as posting but have come here for years doing "research" - I was given a script for Lyrica about 7 months ago and I thought I hit the anti anxiety drug jackpot only too  gain over 25 pounds in 3 months, swell up in my hands and become miserable in how I looked. It was such a bummer as for the first time I felt calm in the mornings and slept well when taken at night,  However I have decided it is not worth it and as of yesterday - no more. I have been on some form of prescript-ed  anti anxiety benzo since I was 17- ( in my 40s today).  Today I still am on  klonopin and xanax (for BT) so I  was not afraid of Lyrica  WD - but one should be if u are NOT taking some type of back up benzo or med too  help the wd.The drug workd on the Gabba receptors so be aware.   Its such a shame Lyrica causes the weight gain and bloat as it works very well but the side effects and cost are obscene. I know of 5 people in the last month choosing to get off it. I wanted too chime in on what ^muvolution^ said, he is right. More than 300 mgs for a non hard core user is unnecessary..wait to see how it hits you.  I gave my ex marine b/f who is  6 foot 3 b/f  only 2 100 mgs and could not walk -talk and was breathing so deeply I was sure I had killed him with 2 damn Lyrica's. Its a weird drug- not that much fun but great for anxiety- in Europe they give it rather than xanax.  For a minute it was the "hit" new pill- it did not take long it 2 really get under peoples skin for the cost- both physical and $$.~~Peace- rabbithole123

Ugh, I had no dirty  hangover, actually a good time, but I did end up in jail on a drunk in public charge.


I'd usually be panicking in a frantic any other time, but with the duration of lyrica still riding along with the booze,held it together like a boss until I posted out.


This was years ago, wasn't even super duper wasted off the booze, but, Lyrica at the higher doses can make you kinda wobbly and make you look more fucked up then normal.

Through some quirk (I have medicaid), I ended up getting brand name Lyrica from Pfizer, and it doesn't help my pain whatsoever. I'm prescribed 100 mg 2x a day, so I have 6g to burn through monthly. Like I said, it doesn't help my pain, so every week or so (generally), I'll just take 1.5 g of Lyrica and be high as gas all fucking day, come home around 3 (I wake up at like 5), crash suuuuuper hard (people cant wake me up), grab my dinner out of the microwave, and sleep very well that night. Am I the only one who takes amounts like that? I also do it orally,

It wasn't a quirk of luck that you got the brand name Lyrica. Pfizer has the patent so no generics are available and all scripts are filled with brand name Lyrica from Pfizer.

If you guys can't afford lyrica,  why don't you just get neurontin and  stagger it?  I get 4 600mg neurontin a day and as long as you take them with 45 minutes or so between each one you pretty much get the same feeling as lyrica.  

I am curious about one thing though.  I only have 6 50mg lyrica someone gave me today and a crap load of 600mg neurontin.  there is no way 6 lyrics will get me real high because I have a huge tolerance to everything.  If I took neurontin with the lyrica,  would it pretty much be the same as if I had more lyrica?  I'm crashing off of adderall right now and am getting really tired and dyshoric.  I need a pick me up and wonder if the neurontin and lyrica will wake me up and give me some euphoria back or make me more tired.  I have xanax alcohol klonopin suboxone and baclofen as well.  I wonder if any of the things I have can be put together in a proper combo so that I don't fall asleep and continue to feel this shitty.  I deff don't want to take anymore adds because the comedienne would be much worse.  advice anyone? 

thanks

I have a high tolerence to all Gabagenics too.


Personally, I would do 300mg Pregabalin, **** Gabapentin (I'd guess at between 2400-4800mg), 2mg Xanax, 4mg Clonazepam, 70-100mg Baclofen and a cheeky line of Subutex/Suboxone (tolerance dependant).

Thank you for pointing out that the cocktail of drugs you mentioned was "tailored" to your specific tolerance/experience. I think that is extremely important because a "newbie" could come onto BL looking to see how much of these drugs he took from his families medicine cabinet he should take, and see your post and decide to take what you take because he doesn't really know any better. But with your warning, the risk of that happening is lowered. Good job!

I take a low dose myself because I had a physician that was horrible about filling my scripts on time and left me without my meds several times over the last couple of years. I take 50mg twice per day for nerve damage, the Lyrica only had side effects for the first week but after that if you miss a dose, or run out like I did, the results were flu like symptoms for 5 days, just generally lousy feeling, irritable, and tired. These days I have a better Doctor and keep two weeks supply as a backup so I can avoid the withdrawals if something happens and I can't get a refill immediately.

I am prescribed lyrica 150 twice a day but haven't taken that dose yet. I had a few days off it due to a binge on other substances. Tonight I ran out of other things so I took 1000mg orally. Then about an hour later I decided to mix another 1000mg for iv use. I did it in two shots. I just mixed it in water as its supposed to be soluble then filtered it twice ending up with clear liquid. It gave an opiate like nod for a short time. Then now I feel pretty out of it. Its not really my type of drug and I would recommend just taking it orally. The half good iv feeling is too short lived. Things on my computer screen seem to be moving. Its a bit hallucinogenic and seems to make me hungry lol

I posted in this thread awhile back about how 90% of lyrica is passed unmetabolized in urine. Well, I had a lapse in my insurance coverage this week, so I was forced to apply this bit of knowledge...consuming my urine... to avoid the awful WD feelings and be able to work, and what do ya know it really did work! I know most of y'all are probably grossed out at the mere idea of this, but TBH urine actually tastes better than gatorade to me, and it is a safe practice for anyone with good functioning kidneys. Not only is it safe, urine therapy is a well respected practice in ayurvedic medicine.

First time poster here, long time lurker.


Just done 22 (25mg) capsules oral which equals to 550mg, realised i had another 4 so parachuted them within 5 minutes of taking the cap dose, current dose: 650mg. Stomach = Empty, been offered food but i want this experience to be as intense as possible.


Hopefully this is a good ride ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) will report back on effects, currently it may be placebo im 36 mins in and feel kinda hyper, typing more etc.


Time taken: 18:00 GMT 550MG Oral - 18:05 100MG Parachute


-18:43: Feel kinda awake and rushy, like im on speed, good so far.

-19:00: Got The Very Best of Milk Inc. on - music definitely feels amplified slight stomach cramp, gonna go play some games and return later.

-19:20: Sat on tinychat feeling like im on 400mg codeine, only had lyrica today, still got music blaring, ive got a feeling the best has yet to come but im skeptical.

-19:40: Wow hazy feeling, very talkative, it's a nice drug so far, slightly harder to type though feel pretty dumb lol.

-19:57: Everything is brighter, colours are exaggerated, slightly dizzy dont wanna stand up, pretty clumsy feel very out of this world, this is great so far, very unique high (if i can even call it a high) like some kinda modified MDMA or something, but you also feel chilled aswell as hyper, i don't quite understand it to be honest lol its really hard to explain, everything is wobbly i get like a cold shiver feeling coming now and again almost like being on a roller coaster and going down a drop.

-21:09: Nicely zoned playing League of Legends owning, pretty good if you got nowt else.

-6:27(A.M): Still going, playing league totaled feel a bit rough now but it was ok i suppose and still feeling it, this stuff keeps you awake lol.

A little late in answering this, and it actually has been answered, and answered very well I might add.


I have read that Lyrica is anywhere from 2 to 4 times as potent as gabapentin so I guess that is as good a starting point as anything. I am prescribed 150 mgs 3X's a day.  I have never been prescribed gabapentin though I was given it while hospitalized with the Spinal Cord Stroke that started the entire chronic pain thing I am now saddled with. I vaguely remember the neurologist standing over me in the hospital, seems I was in a morphine haze for the first month I was in the hospital, and telling the nurse to take me off the gabapentin because it was causing my right leg to swell and apparently to swell significantlyl  But hell, I didn't care because all I wanted was another shot of that awesome and dreamy morphine!


Anyway, I wanted to ask you, mygreenbic,about the baclofen you mentioned having. It is none of my business and if you tell me to fuck off, then I understand and it's cool, but why are you prescribed the baclofen?  I am prescribed baclofen, three 10mg tablets daily, for spasticity that resulted from the spinal cord injury. It seems to work as I am able to place one foot in front of the other at the correct distance and spacing.  I am on a walker and can walk relatively  well and with a steady gait so I am happy enough with it.


One other thing, and I hope you do not see this as me being nosy, but I read your bio and just wanted to say to you, it DOES get better.  The old cliche, time heals, is true. My 25 year marriage ended in July of 2005. My addiction was too much, even though she gave me chance after chance to get better and was there to help when I needed it most, the draw of the opiates was just too great and I lost her.  Broke my fucking heart, no, it shattered my heart. But time has finally healed it.  I woke up one morning in late winter of 2008 with the realization that I would be alright, a fucking epiphany, and so far my heart is still intact.  It WILL GET BETTER, just believe it!!

i like the high, its a mix between weed/alcohol/xtc. Can be pretty overwhelming.


But DO NOT try to quit this stuff without taper/benzo and cold turkey is a freaking hell for weeks. Unbareble and traumatic.

It builds up in two days and then there is horrible plateau with no improvement at all for many days. It makes you depressed and anxious, sort of psychotic. You cant walk, eat, sleep, function. Feel like you have the worst flue. Its the worst ive ever been through and i have ben trough SSRI withdrawls, psychoses, a major infection in my longs, broken ribs etc. Dont get addicted, dont!

I am prescribed lyrica for my anxiety. I only take 25 mgs 2x a day. Sometimes I only take it once a day. I used to take gabapentin, but the side effects were intolerable. Lyrica makes All my pain go away and helps w my anxiety. I dont know about all the recreational uses, bc I don't get into all that stuff. But I think Lyrica is great. I feel happy, and in a wonderful mood, nothing bothers me. I will say tho that I drank a few shots the other day and I got trashed and don't remember much so be careful drinking on it. I dont know if that was from the wellbutrin or lyrica or both but I won't be drinking anymore lol.  I like lyrica better than xanax which I am also prescribed.

Really?.... you are prescribed Lyrica for anxiety? I didn't know it could help with that. I thought it only helped with nerve related issues/pain.

It works ok for anxiety if you take a high enough dose or aren't tolerant. 300mg works pretty good for anxiety when I'm home but I wouldn't do it if I had to work or drive somewhere.

I have taken high doses of lyrica many times but never noticed any anti-anxiety effects. Although that could be because I wasn't looking for them and wasn't aware that lyrica was capable of anxiolytic effects.

Lyrica is such a weird fucking drug.


Like a combo of so many things, but not really quite like any those exactly, just a nice mix.


It has like a benzo, alcohol,opiate, maybe some ecstasy, kinda feel...really unique. 


Gives me this nice uppity manic vibe at time, while being quite spacey, really dissociated but also quite motivated. 


On 750mg right now, I get a relatively small script, not as much as I had in the past.


Don't like to take it often, but I like to have it on deck to play around with and experiment.

so has there been any deaths from lyrica OD? I am just curious how much of this stuff I can really take. I am prescribed 9 grams a month,and have taken over a gram. How much until its dangerous? I love Lyrica. For whatever reason, my insurance denied me pregabalin so I get the real Lyrica, the ones made by Pfizer and they are AWESOME. My parents don't like me taking it though, not at all. It fucks me up. I enjoy combining it with psychedelics

According to Wiki generics became available in Canada in 2013, will become available in the EU in 2016, and in the US in 2018.  So 4 more years for me and Pfizer.  I took 450mgs with my initial dose of the day at 5pm today.  Getting ready to take my last dose of meds and may go with 600mgs.  The other meds will be baclofen, tramadol, oxycodone, and morphine so my typing may get a bit fucked in a bit.....?.but who really gives a shit! Haha.


Lyrica. ......good shit??

But is anyone sure of the toxicity? I have taken large amounts, (1.5 grams being the highest *counted*), and weigh 135 lbs. I particularly like to combine it with psychedelics for it's potency and long duration, but the fact that I haven't been able to find a toxicity rate (sic) annoys me. Trust me, I have no desire to OD on Lyrica. This is BL, harm reduction comes first. That's the reason I'm so eager to find out. I don't want to guinea pig myself into a grave just because I like to get high. I'm pretty sure everyone likes to get high, I mean shit, even growing up as a very spiritual teenager (not anymore) we would get "spiritual highs" from mission trips and whatnot.

- does anyone know how pregabalin affects kidney function? I know it can potentially cause renal failure but thats listed as a possible rare side effect, and says nothing about long term use. 


- there are generics since 2013, thats when Pfzier first lost its patent. Will be overall complete by 2016/18.


- if I do anything over 400mg I feel nausea and fall asleep. So 250-300 is my sweet spot.


- I dont know about the toxicity of pregabalin; but gabapentin was something ridiculous like 24g

I need some help. I'm off Heroin 4.5 days, used a little methadone and now Lyrica (initiated coming off methadone… Couple days now). I sometimes use Neurotin in the morning. I'm concerned about quitting Neurontin and Lyrica now, mostly Lyrica as I can tell it is effecting me a lot and for a longer duration. I'm surprised how well it is helping with withdrawals that I am actually a little concerned. My eyes are watering out and nose running, and some other sx but the Lyrica is helping me mentally. I almost feel high and am only on 100 x2 a day. 


Last time off Heroin, I thought I was going to kill myself. This time I tapered Heroin though a little so maybe my withdrawals are not as bad. Anyway, I'm concerned about stopping Lyrica now. Will it have significant withdrawals ? Anyone had to quit this drug? 


I know this is an old thread but do need some answers. I'll navigate around as well, see if I can find some…

I used Lyrica when I was withdrawing from opiates once (grantedm it was kratom but I was dosing it 5 times a day at 10 grams and had been doing so for a number of years straight, and I get really intense withdrawals from kratom at that level, in some ways worse than poppy tea, namely because it makes me much more restless).  I found that it would mask nearly 100% of the withdrawals, not only would I not feel bad, I would actually feel pretty amazing, with just a bit of energy remaining from the withdrawal).


Lyrica causes withdrawals but I believe it takes some time to develop that.  If you use it just for the acute withdrawals and then stop, I think you should be fine.

Hi Xorkoth, 


Wow! That's a high does. In grams? 


I have yet to experience Kratom, also,  but I've heard it can have withdrawal symptoms… and yes, I feel Lyrica is masking the symptoms, maybe.

I also realized since I've been hallucinating from withdrawals … maybe it just seems like I'm high being I'm taking the Lyrica. Although maybe not.

I have not had much time off and am exhausted, but I do need to stop it probably. Today is day 5 so probably tonight or tomorrow. My system is so sensitive and I can get addicted to valium in 3 days, but can take that at least for 1 day.


Hopefully I'll be okay. Thank you! It just seems so strong in comparison to Gabapentin.

It's one of those drugs that you have no idea what to expect when it comes to withdrawal, some feel little to nothing while others get hit hard.

I have never been able to feel any effects from kratom, unfortunately. Maybe I'm not getting the right kind, who knows?


I just love lyrica. 150 twice a day? Nah, that's like 9 grams a month, so that gives me one day out of the week (I like to do it that way for tolerance) to take 2 grams, not to mention with an extra 500 left over to add to a particularly nice day. My parents don't like me on it at all, they think it's me using heroin, which it's not. It makes me talk very oddly too. No other side effects, though

I have been on Lyrica now for just a bit and my dose this week was raised to 200MG X 3 while I was hospitalized and I had been on that dose for three days and I came home yesterday.  I picked up my lyrica from the pharmacy and when I came home I immediately took 500MG looking for the effects I had previously taking a few of the 150MG tabs.  I immediately became sedated and had to lay down.  This has never happened before.  I was told this morning they attempted to wake my up twice for dinner and I did not respond.


Then something happened to me in the middle of the night which was quite scary.  I woke up about 2AM or so and went out to the kitchen to grab a coke.  With every other step of my feet, I lost control of my arms for a second from the shoulders down.  Like my arms just went limp for a second.  I spilled the soda because of this and made my way to the living room where I sat down for a second.  It did not happen while I was sitting.  Only when I got up, and took steps, I would lose this control of the use of my arms for a second.  I cleaned up the soda and I filled the glass and tucked it way under my arm and could barely hold it step by step but I made it to my room where i crashed back down and slept for 5 more hours and now I am fine after being up for a few hours.


I have taken 300 of lyrica today so far and I seem fine.  I know lyrica is a nerve drug but I want to know if anyone else who has used lyrica recreationally has had this problem at some time.  I have spoken with someone who has had this problem but they have told me with loss of use of their arms they had they same loss of use of their legs at the same time...But I did not have that.


Wow...That was scary for a bit there...Things seems to be fine now...


Thanks for reading...

My only experience so far with pregabalin was the other week. I took 300mg on top of my daily 35ml methadone. After an hour or so i became very drowsy and i just could not keep my eyes open. Luckily i was just sat at home with a friend watching tv. He told me that i'd be fast asleep and then every hour or so i'd open my eyes for a few minutes and then i'd be straight back out of it.

It kinda felt like i was gouching out on heroin with the nodding off and brief moments of being awake and then back out again. When i stood up to go to the bathroom i was stumbling all over the place. The following day i still felt very spaced out and a bit stumbly also until around midday when i was back to normal. Was a pleasant experience overall

When I mixed Lyrica with Heroin, when I was tapering down… I absolutely had to lie down for a couple hours…  I took it for withdrawal also, but only a little bit ... and was ok. 


When I used to take Gapapentin I couldn't move when I first took it… I was scared, I took too much … I couldn't drive, had to pull over and sleep in the back of my car for 2 hours. The previous day I went to the movies and fell asleep in the theater… They hit me differently. Gabapentin is more immediate, Lyrica subtly creeps up on me.

I gave Pregabalin(Lyrica) another go during the week. This time i took it in the day time as opposed to the eveningtime which is when i took it last time. I had taken my daily dose of 35ml methadone and 10mg diazepam and had 300mg Pregabalin on top.

Last time i used it it was in the evening and i was pretty tired and the pregabs put me to sleep pretty much. This time it was just after lunch and it took about an hour before i started to feel the Pregab. I felt light headed, spaced out feeling and it put me into a really good mood. I just felt happy without any worries and talkative. When i stood up to walk i felt like i was drunk and was stumbling about again. It was kinda like when you have a few drinks of alcohol and you aren't drunk just tipsy but this felt more clear headed tipsy than alcohol does. It was great.

I've only got 2 x 150mg capsules left now and no chance of getting anymore but i have enjoyed the few that i had and it was a new drug experience i hadn't had before.

These can be psychologically addictive. At least there are for me. ALthough I can go for days and weeks without taking any, I always find I enjoy life much more when taking them. So after a while life becomes really dull when not taking them

I'm having some problems due to Lyrica. I took it for withdrawal from opiates, stopped it days ago… and last night experienced what I believe some significant withdrawal effects…  Almost 2.5 weeks off Heroin so I don't think it's rebound from that as the effects were itching on my skin and some blood when I scratched where I itched, insomnia and intense sweating chills, and intense pain in my joints. I may be hyperthyroid again, but I don't believe that's the case… I took double my Seroquel dose and still couldn't sleep barely. 


I know it effects everyone differently but I would be careful with this drug. I am going to switch over to Neurontin as I am familiar with it (at night for a few days). I was able to get off of it last time fairly easily.

I got a ton of this shit and gabapetine (almost same shit) in my closet, it does nothing for me at any dose either drug, snorting gabapentine is not a bad high to me that's all these are good for. They are for nerve pain and eplilepsy.

Have you tried Pregabalin on top of opiates as that really does give an enjoyable high but i imagine it's only going to work if kept to occasional usage

I have snorted gaba with coke and it was good. when you snort gaba its a short short high. most jails have banned inmates from getting gaba in jail cuz its basically jailhouse coke.

I don't like them either, absolutly bunk in comparison to all other drugs I was addicted to ... but the Lyrica was helping with nerve pain.... I'm experiencing some quite debilitating pain ... From spinal complications. That's why I needed opiates in the first place... Finding it very difficult to do a simple job in the day for work. I've been downing caffeine which helps but hurts. Cocaine was my former DOC.

If you've been using it for a long time and in large doses it's like a combined benzo/opiate withdrawal, darling, and can last as long as 10 days.


To cope I'd use (aside from benzos and opiates):


L-theanine, Valerian, Hops, Magnesium, Kratom.


Good Luck.


Sheer hell on Earth.


P.S. The Head psychiatrist in my city says Neurontin is very dangerous and worse than Lyrica (even if it's much weaker).


Something to think about, he's very smart.

no way, Gabapentin (***Neurontin) ***is a safe as it comes. It by far is the weakest and safest epilipic drug there is. It is barley used for epilepsy anymore and more of a nerve pain drug. its side effects profile is small and it is tolerated very well by almost all who take it. I can tell you this from talking with so many neurologists and epileptologists over the last 20 years.

You need to read around here at bl about how safe gabapentin is for some folks.  I've never been on it, except for a two week period in the hospital and was taken off due to it causing my right leg to swell.  But there are people here who have experienced withdrawal symptoms from it's use.  Lyrica can also cause withdrawal,  and I am on this drug.  It has proven to be an excellent medication for the burning I have from neuropathy, and does not take two weeks to begin working.  I began to get relief on the second day I was taking it and have continued getting relief for the past two years.

There is so much debate regarding these 2 drugs. I don't like Gabapentin (at least in large doses), as I feel drunk and don't care for liquor. When I took it before, I didn't have much w/drawal in comparison to what Lyrica might do, and what I experienced with it briefly.  I preferred Lyrica verses the Gabapentin. 


The drug did help with some pain…  but if I have to take it again … I hope to stick to a low dose. 

I took it though for detox. I wonder how it would effect my system when I reach homeostasis. I just got a health plan rolling now and unsure what they cover. Whichever is the newer drug will probably not be the covered one… haha!

**lyrica myrical. It kicked adderalls stupid ass**


![8o](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eek.gif)let me talk about this stuff while I'm on it. I've been on an adderall binge for over two weeks now. I was in the darkest area I've ever been in my life today. I have never felt such hell, pain and suffering and despair like I was feeling today and the past couple days. I have to admit the lack of sleep and constant ups and downs took me to the end of the road and I thought about doing something I don't want to mention. I read about Lyrica helping but I didn't really think it would because I take grams of gabapentin every day. But before doing something drastic I decided to give it a try. I had to spend almost two hundred dollars to just get a partial of my script. I took 900mg. For the first hour I just felt like I was on gabapentin. The second hour all of the sudden I I feel like I never took an adderall before! If you could imagine how horrible my life was until I took this its a freaking miracle. It's a bit much, I'm hallucinating and I very much have that gabapentin feel in me. But my god what a a drastic change. I have been through methadone withdrawal, benzo withdrawal, heroin withdrawal, but nothing was bad as what amphetamine put me through. No sleep, and after while I just felt like I was stuck in a constant amphetamine crash no matter what I did. How amazing of a drug that it could actually save my life. No amount of benzos could do this. 

Has anyone been through this before? What happens when it wears off? Am I going to feel the adderall crash again? I don't feel like I am. 

The hallucinations are weird. Very visual especially close eyed. I'm going to force myself to stop writing now because I realize it's too much. I'm sorry but I can't help it. 

Ty Lyrica


an hour later.... Im still greatful that this helped me so miuch but now I just kind of feel like IM on a shit ton of neurontin. Where do I go from here? Will alcohol change it? I need more of a nodding feeling. Im too neurontinish. I feel like my blood is made out of plastic or something. Have that  gabapentin taste in my mouth. I have a whole lot of neurontin left, will that substitue for lyrica when it comes to withdrawling from it or is it not cross tolerant?


Im sorry to add this but its important. Im prescribed lyrica for intense pain in the cervical region of my neck and kyphosis. The lyrica right now is making the pain inflame really bad. Has this happened to anyone else? my god its painful.

first off I have been on both of these drugs on and off for many years (well gaba much longer, since lyrica is somewhat new), I have epilepsy I can tell you everything I wrote is as true as it gets. It does take two weeks for gaba to reach its FULL effect. Talk to neurologists and epileptologists as both these drugs were developed for epilepsy first. I will not jump into this ridiculous conversation any further. If you want to believe that gaba is dangerous and half the other crap I have read on this post go right ahead. Shit ask a neurologist. don't take my word for it.

Are you okay? I am just seeing this and going to sleep… Feel free to write me anytime. Do you have any valium or seroquel? Those have helped me reduce hallucinations, bring me down, ground me etc …. although I am not sure of mixing them with amphs/lyrica. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

(btw, i've had microdiscectomies multi level cervical and although i prefer lyrica for feeling … gabapentin helps more directly. Sometimes Lyrica makes my neck worse) ![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif)

Wow, did a difference of opinion strike a nerve to such a degree that you would pick up your ball and go home? Just google gabapentin withdrawals.  There are more people on this drug than just you and drugs affect different people differently. So you can deny that gabapentin and lyrica can cause  withdrawals, but that don't make it true. Sorry 'bout that.

 You must be feeling sleep after taking the lyrica (depending on when you took it) Listen, lyrica is a pretty safe drug as far as things go, so dont worry, you'll be okay to go to sleep. In fact its a great for a upper come down. Just relax, have some hot milk and try to sleep. I promise you will be okay.

Thank you so much for the reply. I was afraid to sleep last night because I didnt want to crash and sleep for 3 days straight or something like that or maybe not wake up, I was just concerned because I was pretty much having amphetamine psychosis, but the lyrica really got rid of all of that bs and I was fighting sleep. But I fell asleep for like 3 hours then my phone rang and woke me up and I had a severe severe headache. Concerned that it was a really bad migraine, I stupidly took some adderall for its vasoconstrive affects. I really should have just stopped when I was ahead because the lyrica saved my life from the hell of amphetamine use hardcore and no sleep for 14 days. But now the headache is so bad, Ive had bad headaches most of my life but this one is different. Its reallly extreme on the right side of my skull.. It feels almost like my brain is pushing against my skull. I almost want to poke a hole in it to relief the pressure its so bad. So once again IM turning to you guys for a piece of advcie. Im worried its either Reversible Cerebral Vasoconstriction Syndrome or maybe hypotensive crisis. I need someone with knowledge of propranolol and possible its interactions with adderall to give me some advice. Is propranolol a vasoconstrictor or vasodiolator? This is very important for me to know because I believe the headache can be reversed my a beta blocker because it lowers blood pressure but if I screw up and its a constrictor then I might end up in some serious trouble. Like usual, Im in no condition to be at the hospital, Ill end up locked in the psych ward for abusing drugs or maybe even prision and Ill lose all of my prescriptions. 

I also still have lyrica left, which I was kind of saving for another adderall emergency, but if that can relieve this headache Ill take it. Or is that maybe what can cause a headache like this to begin with? Im sorry for all of these panicing messages but I love bluelight and I trust some of you guys more than I do doctors. 

As far as edgewise1 are you refering to me? I cant really figure out who your talking to. Im not saying that lyrica and adderall arent addictive. I know that they are. Ive been taking gabapentin for years and more than one time ive been through excruciating withdrawls. And to whoever was talking about your screwed if you ever have an opiod addiction, well Ive been through withdrawal from pretty much every opiate there is up to and including methadone. So I really cant figure out what your saying. But anyways someone please respond because I dont want to call 911.

Is lyrica something euphoric compared to benzodiazepines? The only GABA drugs I found euphoric was Etizolam and GBL (really intense euphoria) . Phenibut caused a bit of it too, it seems that drugs that work on GABA-B cause more euphoric than the GABA A.


I recently tried Miltown/Equanil/Meprobamate almost the same as Soma (which I never tried) because many said it would be the closed actually to qualuudes what you can still get, but there was nothing special about it at 800mg (2 pills)


Is Lyrica comparable to GBL in terms of Moodlift/Euphoria

No greenbic, nothing intended for you.  Just going back and forth with hoopy.  Btw, headaches are one of the top side effects when starting out on Lyrica.  Have you been taking it very long?  If the pain continues, even though you don't want to do it,  you really need to go to an er, or maybe an urgent care facility.

Oh, I know that feeling. Once I crashed for 2-3 days ... from amphetamines. I woke up and went to a funeral and was a day late. The wrong day. Terrified the hell out of me.

Glad you are awake today and posting. I took propranolol during acute hyperthyroidism. I have a bottle at home. I'll look at it and see if I can get some info. It messed with my heart it seemed, but looking back... my heart was racing from hyperthyroid and it actually may have been slowing my heart down. I know it helps with anxiety so I wouldn't think it would hurt. But, I would call an advise nurse. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I've been through both so I'm in the position to compare.


Lyrica withdrawal (after real, long-term addiction on high doses) is basically like a long, heavy benzo withdrawal with a bit of opiate withdrawal thrown in.


Many find benzo withdrawals worse than opiate withdrawals, as do I, for different reasons.


So with Lyrica withdrawal being like a benzo withdrawal with some opiate withdrawal thrown in I'd say out of the 3, which are all horrific and I've experienced the full extent of, Lyrica is probably the one I least want to go through again.


I think it's rather those who haven't experienced the worst Lyrica withdrawal can do that are likely to say these things. They have maybe used it on and off in lower doses for a few months and never become really physically addicted and so are convinced their guess (because that's all it is) must be right.

 It's temazepam's high potency that makes it a good substitute for barb wd's. But Gabapentin is weaker than pregabalin so might not be as well suited as a substitute

Yes GP can act as a substitute for PG if you are tapering, and it will help you lower your doses of PG and be helpful during WDs. However I dont quite understnad your first question. 


Take Mg supplements, if you are taking GP and also if you are coming off either. Also if you have only been taking PG for a while, try your best now to lower doses. The best way to not get hooked is lower doses, no moe than 250-300 twice a week max. Like Ninae said, its a bitch of a WD otherwise.

I came across something online about Gabapentin and a JNK gene, n some other stuff below.


 "If Neurontin is used for a prolonged period of time the Neurontin will deplete the B vitamin biotin from the body. A deficiency of 'biotin' will cause numbness or tingling of the extremities, a reaction to loud noise or a reaction to bright light which could also include seizures. This is a biotin deficiency and not a medical problem. Put the right amount of biotin back in the body and these symptoms vanish. It is that simple."


" A metabolic disorder will take place with Neurontin usage in an area called nitric oxide and nitric oxide synthase. These are also known as NO/NOS. Too much NO will overwhelm NOS and then a substance called NMDA will go out of balance and this will lead to the misfiring of calcium. Here you have the rapid start of anxiety and the start of insomnia."


" Natural supplements can be used to regulate the JNK gene, anxiety and insomnia. The Neurontin creates a metabolic disorder bringing some enzymes too high and when the flow of the metabolic system becomes stuck or flowing too profusely the body canâ€™t handle it and a cascading effect takes place. You may become anxious due to the calcium firing erratically or by the adrenals out of balance or a host of proteins being too abundant or even too few. "


I know biotin can be bought at Target or health food stores, I've seen it around.

Your mileage may vary. In my experience, yes. It's been a few years since I last had any GBL but I remember the character of the high distinctly and I would say I prefer pregabalin over that (and over benzos too for that matter - any kind). I think what makes me say that is the absolute clarity of mind I experience on pregabalin - both benzos and GBL leave me with a somewhat muddy feeling, and while I find the anxiolysis of the three to be on the same level, I would choose pregabalin over the others any day.


I cannot even compare pregabalin to anything really, the effects I get are unique. If I had to describe what I feel on as little as 150 mg of pregabalin it would have to be what you are left with if you take the extreme serotonergic rush away from MDMA, but leave all the other desirable dimensions intact, and eliminate all the speedy adverse effects but leave the stimulation. Thoughts are lucid, sharp and clear, conversation flows unhindered, an extreme lightness of body, anxiolysis and stimulation at the same time, increased empathy towards others, slight enhancement of colors and textures, etc. It is like reality+ if you will - reality, just better. I take 150 mg for painting (I get about twice as good compared to when painting sober for some reason, and this persists even while looking at it sober - not just under the influence), working out, running errands I have been putting off, cleaning, socializing in a smaller setting instead of alcohol, etc.


I take 300 mg when I go out. Dancing is bliss. Thoughts get slightly unhinged in the same way as after a small amount of weed. The self-confidence of coke without turning into a prick, I can stride into a club without giving a shit about who might be staring at me, something I can have problems with normally. Hell, even breathing is enjoyable. I remember times where I have been dancing for hours on 300 mg and then just decided to run all the way home because moving is so euphoric. If I decide to go for a walk with my headphones on it feels like I can walk to the end of the world, no problem (I seriously hope pregabalin is considered doping even though you would really not expect it to increase endurance). The list goes on. At the end of the night, in spite of the stimulation, no problem sleeping whatsoever. Solid, refreshing sleep.


It takes some 2-3 hours before the effects plateau for me, which does not coincide with the plasma concentration, as peak plasma concentrations are reached after about an hour if I remember correctly. I can still feel the effects some 12 hours after intake and the plateau lasts for a good 6 hours at least. I do not seem intoxicated on pregabalin to the outside world, I have been in professional settings and around my very conservative family on both 150 and 300 mg numerous times without anyone raising an eyebrow. No wonder it is my favorite substance of all time, the high adapts to any situation, whether it is dancing the night away with my friends in a club or melding with the couch or giving a presentation in class. I am confident that I could feel great on 75 mg as well, but I have never come across anything smaller than 150 mg capsules and I am not about to take them apart. It also potentiates opioids very nicely.


Drawbacks? Of course. Pfizer still has a patent and will have it for years upon years for that matter, so prices even from the pharmacy are steep. Tolerance develops extremely quickly. To avoid this I always make sure to optimize my dosing: no more than 600 mg per week. Whether I choose to take 150 on Monday, 150 on Wednesday and 300 on Saturday, or 300 on Friday and 300 on Saturday, does not matter. If you are unfortunate enough to get yourself addicted then it is my understanding that you can expect withdrawals on the scale of benzo + opioid wd's simultaneously, as has also been stated in this thread previously. I have never experienced withdrawals myself, nor do I intend to. I am sure that going beyond 300 mg at once for me would just lead to more loss of motor control (I get slight signs of this at the end of the night if I have been drinking a beer or two in addition to the pregabalin, the fine motor movements of walking down stairs are made difficult for example). I first tried pregabalin in 2011 or so and I still get a high of the same intensity as when I first tried it.


Now, from this description, I can see why one would be excited to try it. My two best friends have the exact same reaction to pregabalin as I do and at the same doses. However, it seems that many find the high to be subtler than expected. I think this is a matter of what you are used to. All three of us use doses that vary from getting laughed at to being moderate (at most) in terms of other drugs, from weed to stims to opioids. I find it absolutely remarkable that calcium channel blockade has such profound effects.

Don't think just cause you have a high tolerance to opiates that you will have one for lyrica. They are two very different drugs.


Don't take that much again if you feel bad check into a hospital immediately.

Hello. I have an extremely high tolerance to lyrica. I have fybromialgia and it never help for pain so i would take more. Thats when I realized it made me feel good. For most it takes a week break for tolerance to drop. For me it takes 2-3. I see people on here talking about their high tolerance and that they take up to 1.3 g (1300 mg). In a single dose, and I'm not trying to brag or anything, I can take 6 g (6000 mg). I get 300 mg pills twice a day so that's 60 a month. I go through them in a week, or less, if I can't manage to take a break and I go through hell for the rest of the month. And what's sad is it doesn't get me high any more. Originally I wasn't looking for the high but it helped me forget about the pain since the regular dose doesn't help. I don't know what the consequences of taking such a high does is or if there is any since its extremely hard or OD on. I also don't know how to stop or what else I can do to try and help the pain. Whether it's something cheap and easy to get for a good high to forget about my pain or whether there is something out there that may actually help my pain. If anyone could help please let me know because I also suffer from major depressive disorder so this is killing me, or may end up killing me is more or less the proper description. I don't want to talk to my GP because then Ill loose the lyrica. I just don't know of any other solutions. I've tried Kratom but it did nothing and I don't know where to get poppy seed tea (in Canada) and I've looked all over the net for help and can't find a thing. Anyone... help.... please....

Holy that's a lot of lyrica Your lucky pregabalin has a limited absorption rate. You must get terrible withdrawal symptoms that's no way to live where your sick more often then not. I would talk to your doctor tell him what's going on then get weaned off the stuff properly and find a medication that works for you because this isn't working for you.

If your doctor has any sense he wouldn't cut you off mabye try not to say you were chasing a high though. Tell him you were trying to relieve your pain by upping the dose many doctors don't even think lyrica gives anyone a "high" because their all told its a non narcotic and the commercials all make it out to be safe and non addictive. Yea right while they show a guy pain free gardening pretty flowers they list a seemingly endless list of side effects that sound horrible and forget to mention its an addictive drug.


Opiates may help take your mind off withdrawal and pain but they are different drugs so it won't do too much in the way of helping withdrawal from lyrica.


You need to be tapered down off this dose for one your wasting a hell of alot taking so much yoir body can only absorb so much before it just starts excreting the drug unchanged. The max dose of this stuff is generally considered to be 600mgs and your taking 10× more than is recommend by doctors. If you need to go higher than 600 then its time to start thinking of another drug with your doctor. Remind him what will happen if you stop this drug cold turkey he shouldn't cut you off after hearing your running out early he should want to work with you to get you better and happier.


All the best sorry I don't know how to get ahold of drugs to help you out but your best bet is to talk to your doctor that's what they are there for.

I appreciate the advice. Unfortunately I've tried all other non narcotic drugs for my pain, as far as my doctor has told me, Lryica is/was the last one she tried me on and for a while it actually worked. I build up tolerance to things very quickly. My doctor also doesn't believe in narcotics. It took me a year for her to give me 1 Endocet 3 times a day, and obviously after a time I started running out of that early as well. I get 90 of them and take 10 a day and I do know the ace. will kill my live but 10 a day is still under the max daily dosage. So I get relief for a whole 9 days out of the month. Also because my psychiatrist said that I have an addictive personality she wont give me anything else. My brother has the same thing I do and he is getting 2 Endocet 4 times a day and a long lasting 12 mg hydromorph at night and a 9 mg hydromorph in the morning. Like WTF?!? That's crap. And I cant switch to his doctor because he lives in a home and she only comes to visit once a week and from what I hear she gives them pretty much whatever they want just to shut them up. I don't think she is that way with her normal patients, if she has a family practice, and the only way I have to try and find her is get her name from my brother and look her up. But if I go to that new doctor and tell her the problem and that I need more than what I'm getting she will just think I'm a druggy  and I'm sure she would contact my family   doctor and I would loose all scripts anyway. I'm really at a loss for what to do. If I get her to wein me off of them there is no other solution to help so then I will have nothing at all. I would just go back to buying things off the street but the normal place where every one used to sell changed as they closed the establishment that was there and I don't know where they moved to so I'm screwed there to. Not to mention I'm on disability so I cant afford much any ways. Thank you so much for trying to help but for now I guess I'll just have to suffer.

Have you thought about methadone?? With your addictive personality I think that's your best bet and it does work better than hydrocodone on your type of pain. This is no way to live your taking narcotics like candy destroying your liver while taking lyrica the same way destroying your kidneys. It doesn't matter if your under the limit of apap your still doing major damage the limit of apap each day is 3000mgs and even that taken daily for extended periods has been known to cause damage its simply not meant to be taken daily. But that's the least of your worries the lyrica is going to kill your kidneys soon enough if your lifestyle doesn't make you nuts first. You need to taper that yourself if you can't ask for help get to a reasonable dose.


 It doesn't sound like your doctor is against narcotics if he is prescribing you them of course some are more generous but he's trying to cover his ass you an addict plain and simple its too big a risk to give you more narcotics. Methadone doesn't raise tolerance as fast and lasts longer plus you can control apap intake. 

I would look into that to stop this cycle I can't imagine living the way you are I wouldn't be able to for more than a month. How long has this been going on exactly?

You might be in too deep and not even realize how you look to other "normal" people. I'm not saying that's the case but you probably seem more like a drug addict than a pain patient in their eyes: be it unfounded or not. I would take way more drugs if I didn't have a full time job and other responsibilities to fill my time. Some pain can be mental and some of the extra use/abuse could be due to boredom. Just some random food for thought.

This had been going on for over a year. I was actually on methadone a little while back. I'm trying not to take it as an insult that you say I'm an addict but everybody has different point of views. My point of view is I started with 1 three times a day and slowly worked my way up to 10 because my tolerance to pretty much all drugs, including the non narcotic ones such as anti-depressants, get high very quick. I've been on several anti depressants and anti-psychotics among other thing that I'm not sure what they are called for my many different disorders. Every single one either didn't work at all or worked for a very short period of time and all had to be increased up to the maximum amounts until the doctor had to switch me to a new one and it's the same cycle over and over again with all medications. I've seen social service workers, therapists, as well as a few different psychiatrists and it's always the same out come. With regards to my tolerance a good example is my insomnia. My doctor tried me on, little did I know all of, a lot of sleeping aids. Either they didn't work or they worked for the first night. I found out later at my psychiatrist that she did try me on all sleeping aids. He pulled out his big medical book and started going through sleeping aids asking if I've been on them and I answered yes to all of them. So he gave me Seroqil which I believe is an anti-psychotic as an off label sleeping aid. Now, at 100 mg, this works. Only for 1 - 2 nights max after that it stops. So I've gotten into the habit of using them only after not sleeping for 3 or 4 days, then I allow myself a good nights rest with they medication, then I go back to not sleeping. Like... is there some kind of disorder where you build tolerance to all and any kind of medication? This is really frustrating. I'm considering a pain management specialist but I don't think that will help. Oh... and sorry for jumping all over but my mind races too fast, back to the methadone... it's not accessible to me. It's all the way down town and I'm on disability. I cannot afford bus tickets to get there every day. I only used to go because when I was living with my ex she helped me get a bus pass so I could go. Again thank you for talking to me because I have no one in life pretty much to talk to about this. I do appreciate it.

I take 150 mg x 2 / day of Lyrica. Been taking it for a year. I sometimes take 750 mg two or three times a week. I want to get off this shit with minimal depression/anxiety, because I'm already in a tender place. Can somebody recommend the easiest taper plan? I have access to Ativan, but have benzo abuse in my history... so don't want to repeat that.

Hey Caitir  I'm so very sorry if I offended you by saying you were an addict I do not know you but was just going by how you say you have been taking your medication. I feel so bad for you being in so much pain yet you can't find relief. Its also hard being in pain yet also being addicted to the drugs but many people do end up that way including myself so that's why I assumed your an addict. That and you mentioned having a addictive personality so I automatically assume you've had substance abuse issues in the past.


 I have never heard of a condition like that where your body raises tolerance to all drugs way faster than the average person. I supose everyone is different in the rate their tolerance increases but something doesn't sound right with the way yours is going up so fast with all drugs you take narcotics or not. I'm sure many would say you may need to be honest with yourself and figure out if it truly is tolerance or if it is addiction but it seems fishy it happens with all drugs so you may very well have a condition I've never heard of. Im not a doctor i only hope to be one day when my schooling is done but Mabye there a problem with your liver and it processeing drugs too efficiently while your brain continuously needs more drugs to make up for this. 


I wish i could help you i hate hearing of chronic pain patients like you struggling so much its one of the reasons I want to get into the medical profession. We need to better understand chronic pain so we can come up with new breakthroughs for patients like yourself.


 Mabye get a second opinion with a new doctor is that possible?


You know you can get methadone prescribed from a pain specialist instead of going to a methadone clinic with all the junkies and try to find a doctor who will help you out that way. Sometimes it takes a lot of searching until you can find a doctor that will help you out better but unfortunately when your in as much pain as you that's tough to do. 


So how long did it take for your tolerance to increase with opiates? 

Do you dose your opiates and pregablin together? Or do you take all the opiates by themselves then use the lyrica while in withdrawal?


If you ask to see another doctor or to get referred to a pain specialist then your current doctor shouldn't cut you off no but if he is cruel then I suppose he could do so but doctors are suppose to be a bit more professional than that. Short answer is possibly I mean I've heard of doctors throwing a tantrum and telling their pain patients never to see them again for asking them for a second opinion so it all depends is your doctor professional and caring or a lunatic who hates people/likes to see them suffer.

To beavesmx it literally feels like I've been run over by a car. It hurts all over for no apparent reason. To trainspotter I originally took everything as prescribed. The lyrica was twice a day and originally I had 2 endocet 3 times a day but when my tolerance got to high and I started to abuse it I told my doctor I needed a break for my tolerance to drop. I stopped for about 4 months and spent most of my time in bed. When I asked for my script back I asked for half my usual in hopes my tolerance would gradually increase and then go back to my normal dose until once again my tolerance would increase whereas I would take another break. When I asked for my normal dose back my doctor refused and started talking about taking me off the endocet all together so I changed the subject and stuck with what I have and ended up abusing it. Also I have had drug problems in the past however they were not opioids so I guess you were half right in calling me an addict. I see my doctor tomorrow and am thinking about asking to see a pain specialist but I worry about loosing what I have. I also suffer from anxiety among other disorders so I'm very anxious to even bring it up. Thanks for the replies.

Ever since I started this drug (well I started gabapentin but discontinued it) I have felt that something is "off". There are many days when I wake up happy but in pain, then I take my morning dose (300mg) and while the pain gets reduced significantly, I am not really sure it helps me because I can feel it sucking the life out of me. One hour after I've taken the pills, even with the reduced amount of pain, I get severely depressed. All I want to do is lay in bed because everything feels totally pointless. It's like there are no signal substances being released in response to anything. Everything seems so bland and I feel like I could kill myself and it wouldn't even matter.


Anyone else experience this? I don't know what to do, I can not stop the medicine, the pain is too severe. Anyone else on pain management that needs this medicine but hates the side effects? Would taking anti depressants work against this drug induced depression?


I feel like this drug fooled me by making me feel better mentally and physically at first but after a month or two I started getting really depressed. The silly thing is I still feel good mentally if I up the lyrica dose while my normal dosage now only yields me pain relief with side effects.

Last month I was bumped up to 450mg a day after being on 300 for a year. It has been a godsend in ways but I also wonder if I am digging myself into a hole of deeper dependence, and maybe even 450 will not work anymore at which point I will be taking it only to not be sick yet still being pain.


I find I have to take it very regularly for good effect, just a couple hours off my dose and I will feel tension and anxiety. I'm not taking it for anxiety but I feel it has created an anxiety issue that wasn't there before.


Any advice how I should proceed from here?

Hey caitir,


for how long do you have this condition? Did it start at a similar age in your family members? I think I read in one of your posts it is diagnosed as fibromyalgia. Did your family members get the same diagnosis?

Hi thisisnotarealpers,


of you only have 150 mg capsules, ask your doctor for smaller ones (50mg or 75 mg). 

Start by taking one dose less, so maybe 150 in the morning and 75 in the evening. If it makes you tired, 75 in the morning and 150 in the evening.

After some days, maybe a week, make the other dose 75 mg. Wait some more days, leave one completely.


You could also do it even slower using 50 mg capsules.

I am taking it for chronic pain- nerve damage in my legs, termed peripheral neuropathy. Lyrica phases out the pain as well as any opioid ever did which is the only other thing I found that ever helped it (well, the only prescribable drug- dissociative anesthetics also work but I cant be on them all the time). If the anxiety between doses does get any worse I will definitely let my physician know, but as of now I am fine if I stick to my dose schedule.

If you are suffering from anxiety between doses it means you are in withdrawal and that you are dosing it wrong. Talk to your doctor about splitting the dose, personally I need to dose every 8 hours or I get terrible side effects. It's better for pain relief too if you take it 3-4 times daily instead of 2 (which doctors will usually tell you is enough, although it ain't). You shouldn't have to suffer more than necessary.

Thanks for that reply because that is also my experience, that I had a better time with complete symptom coverage taking 100mg 4x a day compared to  when I switched to 150mg 3x a day.

I've done this before however for me it didn't work out too well because I am extremely sensitive to alterations with this medication. My eye measurements appearently varied enough as to cause minor withdrawal, I was extra lethargic and cranky after some doses. This dissappeared when I started using a 0,001mg scale. Just watch out for it.

I just do not react to a lesser dose or even no dose, when I run out early, as a lot of you.  I am also on tramadol, percocet,  and morphine, and just assumed that this is the reason I don't get withdrawal symptoms if/when I run out early.   Can anybody tell me if I am correct in this assumption?


Also, would the action from tramadol, since it fondles so many receptors?  Again an assumption.

Gel caps work great for this although it can be kind of annoying because of the superfine clingy powder.

Some people just don't get withdrawals from lyrica/gabapentin. Does the medicine do anything for you? I know my dad was put on gabapentin for several months, although he didn't really think it worked so he just stopped without any withdrawal whatsoever. Personally I get never ending withdrawals that are worse than both heroin and benzo combined. I used to be on both clonazepam and methadone and that barely helped at all with the symptoms so I think it's extremely individual. I have read so much about this medicine and my conclusion is that no one really knows what it does or why it works. It's proposed effect at the alpha2delta subunit of voltage gated calcium channels seem far too weak in my eyes to cause this type of withdrawal or the amount of pain relief actually yielded by the medicine. But what do I know, I'm just a drug-geek.

Oh yes it works extremely well for my neuropathy and takes that burning, pins & needles pain away. It also relaxes me and really is synergistic with my other medications.  I just do not react to the loss of it if I run short before it is time to refill, for which I am grateful.

I've tried this and all of the new stuff & plain old amitriptyline works better. It takes the sharp edge off the pain so it's a dull pain - which is much more manageable. YMMV

I found Lyrica to be very synergistic with MXE making for one of the best body buzzes ever.

My doctor had me on amitrytpaline first as a requirement before I could get Lyrica. It is cheaper for the insurance company. It didn't work for me though, I mean yes it DULLED it, but it also dulled all of me and made me sleepy. Lyrica straight up phases out the pain completely while keeping the rest of me in phase. Can't get better than that.

Well upping the dose is a bad idea. I myself have gotten pretty well addicted to it. I take up to 6g in one shot and it doesn't help like it used to. As for the depression I'm not sure if that is a side effect. You never mentioned what you were taking the gabapentin for. Have you been diagnosed with Fibromyalgia? If so it could actually just be depression. I have major depressive disorder. My doctor, at first, thought my pain was due to the depression. After trying several different medications over the years she has finally realized that it isn't the depression and I have finally found a decent anti depressant that help with minimal side effects. If it isn't due to depression and it is something like Fibromyalgia or if you were in an accident or something I would say talk to your doctor about these side effect and let him/her know that you need the medication for the pain otherwise you can't function and ask if maybe you should start an anti depressant. That's my advice from my experience. If there is anything else I can do to help or any other advice just pm me ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) also I'm sorry it took so long to get your message as I have been busy.

I don't think your digging yourself into a whole as long as your taking it as prescribed. Any and every, correct me if I'm wrong please, medication you take you will eventually build up a tolerance and need more. They say there are no addictive properties to this medication but as it stops working you start taking more so yes be careful and again take as prescribed.  As for the anxiety... could be a side effect however I'm not sure. Talk to your doctor and let them know about this and ask if it is normal. I hope I helped.

To all I have replied to. Most of you have been answered already, as I was dumb enough not to read the forum first, but I did my best to answer as well. I'm sorry I've been busy so I kind of let this thread drop for a few days. I'm back if anyone has questions.

Hello Claireclump,

swallowing is just fine. The dosage seems very high. If I remember correctly, 600 mg should be the max dose. However, if your doctor told you so, there's probably a good reason for it. What do you take it for?


To the others:

I never got withdrawals, used to take 200 mg twice a day, sometimes more. Though with 300 mg I was just more confused and walking straight became harder, but didn't make me more happy etc. I think, if I leave it away, the symptoms I am taking it for (anxiety, pain) just come back.

Somebody here hypothesized that only people who have been on benzos/opioids get withdrawals, I guess in a sense of used to be addicted. Don't know if there's any truth to it, hope somebody does a study about it.

I don't mean to insult you, but 6 grams at once?!?! You are only creating a tolerance that will take forever to bring down, not to mention the damage you are doing to your kidneys. I realize that you are in pain but surely you must realize that upping your dose that much is dangerous and a bit foolish. I agree that you should have a talk with your doctor about helping you to lower your dose and jump off of it since, as you say, it is not helping you. At least you would not have to worry about withdrawal from it for 3 weeks out of the month. I would advise you to do a CWE on your Percocet because at 10 a day you are getting 3,250mg of acetaminophen daily and I think I read that the daily limit has been lowered to 3,000mg? If so then you are playing a dangerous game my friend. Bluelight has already lost several good members and doesn't need to lose another one!  


Again,  please don't take this the wrong way because my intention is not to insult you but to help you and I hope you will take this in that spirit.


Peace my friend...

6g? Didn't you talk with your doctor about other medications? I've stopped at 900mg daily and even though I want to take more to dull the pain, I know it's just pointless because I will quickly aquire the same tolerance and be left with more side effects and worse withdrawal later.


I'm gonna ask my doctor about trying a combination of memantine+lyrica for my pain as I know ketamine+lyrica works very well. Hopefully memantine will have sort of the same effects, albeit weaker. I've read some promising results of using memantine for fibromyalgia, if it works for that it should work against my central nerve damage.

Thankfully losing tolerance to Lyrica isn't very difficult. After being off of it for a few weeks it will start to work again at a smaller dose for a day or two. Then I need to increase, for a day or to, and so on and so on. As for dangerous... look into Lyrica more and you'll find it is very safe and extremely difficult to overdose on so I don't worry about it and I can only see it as being dangerous because of the damage it will do to my kidneys. Also I wouldn't say I go through a withdrawal from it... I just have to deal with the pain. For some reason I don't see to withdrawal from Lyrica. Also I have currently stopped taking the Lyrica. For how long is unknown but at least long enough to not think I need it to function. And I mean need more or less in an addicted way because I do need something for pain to function well (sometimes function at all). And I didn't just stop because I ran out either ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png) I have a half full bottle sitting in my safe. As for the Percocet I would love to CWE it but I am honestly worried that I'll end up loosing some, if not a good portion, of the active ingredient which would make it pointless. I have not heard of the daily dose of acetaminophen being lowered, I'll have to look into that, however even at 3,250 mg daily will kill my liver eventually (even if I am only doing it 9 days out of the month, I used to have a script for 180 a month and then took a 6 month break for my tolerance to drop and when I asked for my script back this time I asked for half of my regular scrip to make sure it is 9 days instead of 18). I thank you for your concern edgewise1 and appreciate it ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) That's why I love BL... because it's an ever growing community of people whom use all sorts of drugs and can give you advice and help. Also every once in a while you run into an individual who actually cares and it makes things easier.

I have never heard of memantine before and I don't think my doctor will give me ketamine. I could be wrong but isn't ketamine used for general anesthesia? If so I don't see/understand how it would help with pain unless your just trying to sleep through it lol

It's all about the dosages, ketamine has provided me with alot of relief when the pain has been extremely bad. In lower dosages it actually acts as a weak stimulant rather than being sedating.

I'll have to ask my doctor about the Ketamine... however I don't think she would go for it. Especially since it's a schedule I controlled substance, which correct me if I'm wrong here, I believe is the worst schedule that a drug can be in. That being said, and after looking into Ketamine a bit more as I'm writing this message (I run duel monitors), I'm actually absolutely positive that she wouldn't prescribe it to me. In fact on wikipedia it states, "No prescriptions may be written for Schedule I substances, and such substances are subject to [production quotas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Production_quota) by the DEA." So even if she decided to help me out with that I don't see how she could. Thanks to all who have answered this thread. It pretty much seems dead now but I'll check back in a day or two to see if there is any more activity.

Hey caitir,


take a look around if there's some kind of specialist for fibromyalgia in a city reachable for you. I've had good experiences with seeing a specialist right away.

Is this a possibility for you?

I've read Tropisetron seems promising in treatment of fibromyalgia...

I've never heard of Tropisetron and I didn't even know there were doctors who specialized in just fibromyalgia. I'll do some research into the Tropisetron as well as see if there are any fibromyalgia specialists anywhere reachable to me... or if there is any period. I noticed your location said your in Europe, I'm in Canada. We may not even have that sort of thing here and if we did why didn't my doctor tell me about it :S lol any ways, thank you for the advice.

Quick update. I looked up Tropisetron and found the Wikipedia page for it. Wikipedia states that it is marketed by Novartis in Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, South Korea, and the Philippines as Navoban, but is not available in the U.S. It is also available from Novell Pharmaceutical Laboratories and marketed in several Asian countries as Setrovel. 


I didn't see Canada on that list anywhere and if it isn't available in the U.S. chances are it wont be up here. However I will do more digging and see if I can find out if it is.

I'd definitely try and ask for the memantine. It's a weaker NMDAR antagonist (same type of drug as ketamine). It's not even scheduled (at least not here in Sweden). While memantine alone might not provide sufficient pain relief, the effect stacks up when combined with pregabalin and/or benzodiazepines. Problem is most doctors have no clue what it is or that it can even be used for pain management.

Hi, i'm new here, just wanted to post about this stuff, basically i have had a drink problem, 4 damaged vertebrae in my back,  an anxiety problem, and some deja vu type feelings, so this drug is about right for all 3 of those conditions. When i first started taking it (75mgs) i didn't feel anything apart from a slight wobble in my movement, after increasing to around 225mgs a day mixed with codeine you can deffo feel something new, its almost like having a few beers without the shit taste, i'm currently on a low dose, so i look forward to seeing what 600mgs feels like if my doctor does what he says, and increses slowly..


Oh and i forget to take my Clonazepam when i'm on it, which says a hell of a lot for its anxiety powers..

I'm on it for almost two years, too. I'm over 190 cm and only a little below 75 kg. I've gained no weight at all. I'm eating a lot (and also a lot of calories) and gained no weight at all.

The first year was 150mg a day. The second year they put me on 300mg a day but I take anywhere from 150-300mg depending on how I feel and I usually only take my dose at night because I don't like how spacey it makes me when I take it during the day.

I take Clonazepam 2mgs a day, since i've started Pregablin, i've gone down to 0.5mgs per day because of the spaced out feeling.. Its an interesting drug.

Yeah pregabalin potentates benzos quite a bit and works great when you come off of them.  This last year I was also dependent on 15mg temazepam and when I decided to come off the withdrawal wasn't too bad in fact using  pregabalin, weed and antihistamines/melatonin I never missed more than a couple nights of sleep.

That cool, i used to drink a bit, but the urge even to have a can has gone just now, Pregablin is the strangest drug i've had, how does it work? and have you had that drunk feeling or euphoria people talk about?

Someone else will have to answer on  how it works. Yes I have gotten the  drunk feeling off of  300mg(haven't gone higher) early on  when my tolerance was lower but in wasn't all that euphoric...I really liked combining it with temazepam, far more enjoyable.

I think I initially started with 75 mg, then got up to 150 mg, then 200 mg, all dosages twice a day.


Now I take only 50 mg twice a day. If I only do it from time to time, 100 mg give me a nice calm euphoria. I can take more, but at some point it messes with my walking and thinking, especially memory.

I have been on Lyrica 300ml for 2 years. I think I have mastered them in what works and doesn't. For best results you always need at least 600ml. You also need to skip days! This is very important. If you want to enjoy the euphoric buzz from lyrica you will need to take them every second day. Lyrica seem a very strange tablet there is days you could take two days in a row and still get a high one the second day, but never as enjoyable and then your screwed for the next day. So always skip a day! I eat my lyrica in the morning with tea before I get for best results, and continue tea or a warm drink throughout the day, and try not eat until you reach at least your peak with them. Although I have been enjoying them for some time, they now leave me very sick on the I don't have them or if it was to go over a day it would be unthinkable! I have done some really stupid shit to get my lyrica and put myself in some horrible situations. I am all for lyrica and think they are one of the best tablets for anxiety but in the long run they catch up with you and I can only compare the withdrawals to that of heroin or Valium, I know these are opioid's but still the withdrawal is similar and horrible.

Best post I have read on lyrica, spot on lad. Only thing people don't seem to be mentioning is that you need to skip days. Take at least 600mg every second day and I have taking 2400mg or a little more and was fine so they seem very hard to overdose so I wouldn't worry about that.

you need to be taking at least 600mg every second day to get a buzz. Always skip a day! They might not work taking every day so always skip! And the days your on them eat as much as you want ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Just to add to my experience drink a glass of grapefruit juice with your dose this seems to speed things up you still get the gradual high but faster about 45 min to 1 hr I took 9x50 mg and about 8 oz of grape fruit juice with very satisfying increase in the speed of effects

Im am so glad im off this crap, is has a huge tolerance, makes me feel drunk, stupid and articulate less acurate. It is addictive as hell and the withdrawls are the worst of the worst.


Stay away from this unless its for neurotic pains, for epilectic seizures there are safer options, and sure as hell don't go near this stuff when you are an addict.


Describing this for anxiety is straight up stupid stupid stupid!!!!!!!!!!

This has been mentioned from time to time, but I still cannot pin-point why this compound causes people to have tremors? 


And its quite unpredictable in determining which instances you might experience such tremors. I did however notice that there are patterns which might attribute to such reaction. For instance if I had abstained from taking PGN for an extended period of time (over 2 to 3 months), these tremors will be introduced once you resume. And it happens at small dosages from 75mg to 150mg, therefore it must not be causal to a dose-dependent scenario where careful titration is involved. Some people are more susceptible to these than others. 


These tremors can be described to be similar to, but to a lesser extent, the muscle contractions from Parkinson's disease. It's quite a conundrum, and even contradictory if you use it for anxiolysis. 


Anyone care to explain?

I've been taking Lyrica for nearly two months. I'm currently taking 300mg per day, due to increase to 600mg. It's made my eyes blurry and my speech slurred, like I'm a little drunk. It's also made my legs a little jelly-like and my balance has gone to pot - not to mention my short-term memory has suffered. But it possesses a curious cotton wooliness that I enjoy. I must add: I take trazodone before bed, for sleep, and combined with the Lyrica, gives me these crazy closed-eye visuals...like fireworks of light and images flashing in quick succession. Today, I'm due to visit my doc to have the dose upped. I'm looking forward to how it's going to make me feel.

I also get these visuals. It's like taking a low dose of ketamine right before bed. It's great actually but I wake up with tired/sore eyes as if my eyes had kept watching the images all night long without any rest.

Yea I can't believe how horrendous the withdrawals are from a pill that seems so mellow. I would have expected some tiredness/lethargy and minor anxiety but it's like taking the physical part of heroin withdrawal, mixing it with the anxiety of benzo withdrawal and adding the long lasting depression/dissociation from ketamine withdrawal all rolled into one awful mess. It also lasts forever. I gave up after 19 months of pure agony.

Crikey!! 


I must say: one of the things I love about lyrica is its ability to play with memory. My short-term memory has gone to pieces but I'm having these colourful, almost spiritual, childhood flashbacks. I could be walking along and a smell, a sight, anything, could trigger a flashback. I can almost hear the laugh of children, the merry chirrup of birds, the smell of freshly cut grass during Summertime, and the smell of the strawberry ice lolly. Its psychedelic. 


I'm not sure how long this will last.

Was wondering why you'd still up the dosage, but obviously you are still in pain. 


High dose Lyrica is mostly pretty nice if you have nothing else to do. At some point I want to get off it completely, as I can't have the memory problems.

Still, it's way better as being in a lot of pain all the time.

For instance if I had abstained from taking PGN for an extended period of time (over 2 to 3 months), these tremors will be introduced once you resume. And it happens at small dosages from 75mg to 150mg, therefore it must not be causal to a dose-dependent scenario where careful titration is involved.

From what I read, this should be because Lyrica binds to voltage dependent calcium-channels, at least to some subunits of them. These (or at least some of them) are in the membrane of Purkinje cells. These cells are in the cerebellum and involved in motor function. So I guess if you start the treatment, these are a little off but will synchronize again after some time. Purkinje cells seem also to be involved in the pathogenesis of essential tremor.

I have tremor without any treatment, but I also noticed that Lyrica gave it a boost in the beginning. It's the same when I up the dose for a buzz.

My doctor gave me Lyrica a couple weeks ago, for fibromyalgia pain and for insomnia. Well, I haven't been taking it everyday as I should. 


First time I took 300mg with opiates. It gave me a strong buzz but it lasted only for maybe 2 minutes and then it was gone. What the hell. Nothing special after that.

Second time I took 500mg, two hours later 200mg more so 700mg altogether. It was nice, okay. When I closed my eyes I saw some visuals. Music felt good. My balance was a little off. Typing was hard.

Third time I took 900mg. Again, it was okay. I liked to listen to some calm, classical music and lie in my bed. 

Fourth time, today, I took first 500mg, hour later 200mg, then hour later 300mg so altogether 1g. I feel nothing special. Kinda pisses me off. I'm going to try adding 150mg more.


What's the "lethal dose" of Lyrica? I read the whole thread and some people were speaking of that some had died because of Lyrica.

ITs suggested that 600mg is the largest dose at any one time. Its hard on your kidneys. But the lethal dose is very high, so I wouldnt really worry about OD BUT, doses like 900mg a go kills your tolerence. ITs a great drug for neuropathic pain, anxiety, and many other things, and yes it can be recreational but I wouldn't abuse it (like I do) because one day you might need it and it wont work.

A strong buzz that lasted two minutes? What the fuck? Everyone is different but one thing generally noted about Lyrica is the lasting duration.

I don't think you will get much more out of it. Music enhancement, mild social lubricant and a mellow drunk feeling, that's lyrica to me at least. It's not a strong drug in terms of recreational effects. Go mix it with ketamine if you want to have fun ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


Also recreational doses will ruin the pain relief relatively fast and then you are fucked because the tolerance never goes down.

it does if you abstain for 48 hours, 72 or even longer. But at LEAST 48 hours and you are feeling pretty much the same effects. However, I know that if you take it regularly for pain, gad etc then that cant be done.

found it to be ineffective for the treatment of chronic nerve pain due to CRPS

also found it to be of less recreational value than gabapentin.

Hi Im new, i had to share my experience from Lyrica (Pregablin). I am prescribed it for anxiety 150mg a day in two doses, I have however recreationally taken it in the past. My first experience I took 600mg and it was a unique and surprising buzz, very sociable on Facebook and loved watching music videos on YouTube, wow the uplifted mood i got from listening to certain tracks was really euphoric almost like taking Ecstasy but not as intense just similar. Really loved the sociable and talkative element it gave. I was wobbly however but that didn't stop me putting my music on my phone and blaring it loud and dancing in the dark to it, oh my WHAT a workout!!!!! I sated up all night till 5AM I DIDNT SLEEP!After it left me feeling very wobbly and weird but not in a bad way similar to and alcohol hangover.

Second time I was my partner and did over 1g so I remember and had a similar experience as above WHICH was a very different experince, i did stay up all night with double vision and couldnt walk in a staright line. But TOLERANCE builds very quickly and I dont do it that often. If I had any recommendation it would be 600mg thats a buzz for me and not too heavy maybe for some but if you havent done it before then maybe a lower dose 200-300mg would be a safer option. I just had to say I LOVE lyrica its a unique buzz in my opinion elemts of alcohol, cannabis and MDMA ecstasy. Done 1050mg 1 /12 hour ago starting to feel the buzz come on, Its a very slow onset not a sudden rush it dawns on you slowly but surely so dont get caught in thinking its not working it is just that it isnt a snapshot high, be patient I say!

no, you're not: pregabalin has a very high therapeutic index.  However, you probably don't need more tonight if you're so severely affected to have such worries. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

I'm not seeing any direct interactions, but pregabalin and gabapentin are not particularly well-understood.

Hey i want to share some of the experiences i made with pregabalin. i get it prescribed for something more then a year for neuropathic pain due to nerve damage from an overdose of opiates in my left leg. It helps better then almost all other medications i tried for this condition except strong opiates. i really could not differentiate placebo from gabapentin, but lyrica is both psychoactive and helps with my pain i feel.  For me doses 200mg+ i can feel, right now sweet spot is 300-600mg in one dose to get "high", and i take 200-300mg of it per day for pain. Its kinda like an imediate releae phenibut. Its subliminal uplifting, gives energy and makes one more sociable and talkative. Best compareble to low dose benzos. Its what i like about most gaba amalouges, its there low abuse potential and general low side effects. I have yet to try baclofene, i will really buy it soon, cause its very cheap. My country is know for the highest medication prices worldwide and Lyrica 300mg x 100 cost a nice 260€ without insurence ( which 99% of the population have), now that the patent has expired its still at a hefty 160€ for such a simple molecule.

Where lycrica also shines is at its help in withdrawal from opiates, it really eases the depresive side of the withdrawal process more so then with the physical pain, where clonidine and loperamide are the better helpers.

I've been taking pregabalin (600mg per day) and a multi vitamin tablet at the same time for the past two days and....totally unexpected high! I've been off my head. Very confident, very focussed, a unique experience. Similar to Phenibut but much more pronounced. No idea what interaction has taken place. It's been a 'limitless' moment indeed. I'm aware that it's going to be brief - these type of highs always are, but just putting it out there. It's not the normal pregabalin, clumsy but sociable kinda feeling I've been used to during the past couple of months. Haha, maybe I've been malnourished and just needed some extra vit D. :D

Did anyone had panick attacks from quitting lyrica? I get this tight feeling and heavy pounding of my heart lately, and i can only attribute it to me quitting Lyrica. I get very agitated and afraid of very trivial things. I often get fears of dying, one day it was so bad i drove with a taxi to the hospital and they made an EKG which came out completly fine. Only after this i realized, this might have been a panick attack, due to the lack of pregabalin. But it only comes in waves and other times of the day i feel completly fine. I also take buprenorphine for the same time i quit lyrica,  the buprenorphine feels very weired and unnatural to other opiates, but it gets rid of the withdrawls good and i have the least side effects of all opiates i ever took, no constipation and all. For your information i jumped off 150 mg lyrica but most of the time i took more 200-300mg. Buprenorphine i take between 1-2 mg.

Trip, did you stop taking them cold turkey then? If so, yeah I bet you're right about getting panic attacks after coming off of them after a long period. It won't last forever, and It's a good sign that you feel content at time, an are aware of the anxiety/ panic attacks. They are horrible,  but there are ways- other than drugs- to control it and make the anxiety bearable.

I've personally had some weird times on pregabalin.. I'm prescribed it for anxiety, addictions, etc., supposed to take 150mgs a day. It just makes me feel extremely wavy and I hate the lack of coordination.. I feel stupid, bad vison, jeable, blargh. I a, just avoiding it from now and taking just my benzos and duluxetine..


Anyway.. Once upon a time I was a depressed and sucidal mess, and took about 50++? of pregabs... Stupid I know.. It was hell, and as one of the after affects I got **Bell's palsy **. Has anyone else got that or anything similar from pregabs?

Lyrica for me is not a strong medication. If functions as an anti inflammatory and it ceases certain pains muscle only. I would normally have to include an opiate to get the desired medical goals.

I find that tolerance does go down if you leave a gap of at least 48hrs.

I don't take it for long periods of time, though, so I cannot comment on cases where it is taken daily for a long time.


EDIT. Actually, on reflection, I think a much bigger gap is needed, since writing the above, I find that lyrica quickly loses it's effects.

Only you can answer this question to be honest. Addiction/habituation has both a psychological and physical dimension. I know people who have been able to keep relatively frequent Lyrica use under control (75-150 mg each time) and I know people who have quickly picked up a daily habit when trying to keep gaps. If you want to find out where you truly stand, try at least a week completely off Lyrica and take note daily how you feel physically and mentally.

This can really vary a lot. It would seem that in your case, three days on-two days off is not enough to display any significant withdrawals as you have been able to keep it up for months, but what would happen if you extended the gap to three-four-five days? Might be worth trying just to see where you are at in that regard (there are reports of high doses daily not causing exceptionally bad w/d's and small doses every other day causing hell when discontinued, so you'd really need to see for yourself).

Most. I cannot endorse mixing but I can tell you that since Lyrica is not metabolized to any significant extent, interactions with other drugs are a non-concern in terms of the CYP450 liver enzymes (the purpose of drug metabolism is to make the substances more water-soluble so they can be excreted more easily, Lyrica is already very water-soluble so it comes out mostly unchanged in the urine). If you're going to combine it with other downers there is always reason to use caution, your motor skills go to hell fast and there's always risk involved if you overdo it (it is impossible to define what "overdoing it" is as this varies heavily, taking Lyrica and then sipping some booze is much preferred over being drunk and popping a capsule). Opioids are potentiated nicely already by relatively small doses of Lyrica so be careful if you are going to attempt that. The undesirable side-effects of stimulants are reduced. Weed and Lyrica is a well-liked combo and probably the safest of combinations relatively speaking.

It is not unheard of for patients to have prescriptions for both Lyrica and modafinil. The exact mechanism of action of modafinil remains a bit fuzzy and the same goes for Lyrica, which is considered to act through voltage-gated calcium channels. There does not seem to be any major immediate safety concerns with combining the two in therapeutic doses, but I cannot evaluate the combination recreationally.

It looks like I may be one of the few who absolutely hated Lyrica.


My hatred may have been coerced by the fact that this was the 50th med I was given in an attempt to avoid increasing my oxycodone script - and knowing that my back pain had nothing to do with nerves (I had my lat muscles transplanted and the pain I was feeling was clearly muscle-related) I knew Lyrica would just be another shitty time-filler while I continued to get my measly 5mg pills (which thank god went up to 15mg soon after).


One day I decided to take double my dose - 300mg - and within 30 minutes I had fallen asleep at the table and proceeded to have "tunnel-dreams" where you feel like you're awake, but you're not, and then you dream that you've woken up but you're still not awake, and it just keeps happening over & over.


I guess that may be an effect someone is trying to achieve - but I'm more of a Stimulant + Oxy kinda gal. Falling asleep & not being able to wake up isn't my cup of tea - but I can concur that there's definitely something about this drug that could have some recreational use of you're into the type of "high" it produces. I definitely felt some psychedelic qualities - but it's just not my thing.


Also / I never noticed any difference when taken with my oxycodone. Obviously everyone's different - but I wasn't one of the lucky ones who felt a better high with the combination.

Hi s0rsha


Thank you for this well written post.

I know you said I would have to have more days off lyrica to see for myself how I go, but could withdrawals kick in after 72hrs?

I was just on a 6 month run of 450mg/day and withdrew for 3 days, its a touchy state, the nerves are hypersensitive. Transitions of energy are hard. negativity and stress must be avoided. I kept it under control though using phenibut and MXE, it was actually quite a nice weekend of R&R, and I would consider using that as a longer term solution if not for the quick tolerance build-up of MXE, but on the other hand Lyrica also has a pretty quick tolerance buildup. I get stable on either one, and tolerance isn't such a bad thing with these drugs; they still work in the background but don't get in the way.

I'm upto page 8, reading this thread and clueing myself up on others' experiences of lyrica, and while I do appreciate repeated questions can irk, I will be reading the rest of the thread in due course.

I doubt, somehow, whether my question has been asked before, but I may be wrong.

If you were to take lyrica every 48hrs, in doses ranging from 225mg-450mg, only dosing once in the day, while this looks like a psychological dependence, could a person get addicted physically, using every 48hrs?

thanks

I was on 600mg of this drug, ive now been tapered to 200mg, personally ive never seen how good this drug was, i always thought it was rubbish, even at the highest dose i never got a high or stoned feeling, saying that im not sure if im feeling withdrawals because im been tapered off a lot of meds.

Yeah its not a great drug when used to oblivion, i.e. every day. Also if your Dr. titrated you up properly thats probably why you never got a good buzz from it.

As for dosing every 48 hours to avoid tolerance/withdrawal, good luck. I am pretty sure though it will catch up to you over time. Every 3-4 days is a safer bet.

No. But, it would depend on what exactly you mean by 'block' and also exactly what SSRI/SNRI you are referring to, since although pharmacologically similar, their mechanisms are often different.


I've taken many SSRIs and SNRIs in conjunction with Pregabalin with no ill effect.

Oh okay. I've never found that to be the case, but as said, it depends on what SSRI/SNRI you're talking about in particular.

Effexor.      I just took 850 mg, with very little tolerance.         I mean i did take like 900 mg last week but nothing happened.   Right now, I feel this warm fuzzy feeling, but not intoxicated at all, which is fine. There is definitely a euphoria.

Oh okay. I used to take 425mg of Venlafaxine and 300mg of Pregabalin for the therapeutic relief of anxiety and I wouldn't say that the Venlafaxine reduced the effectiveness of Pregabalin. Then again, this was at therapeutic doses, not recreational. But no, I'm not aware that Venlafaxine would inhibit the effects of Pregabalin?

I kept it under control though using phenibut and MXE, it was actually quite a nice weekend of R&R, and I would consider using that as a longer term solution if not for the quick tolerance build-up of MXE, but on the other hand Lyrica also has a pretty quick tolerance buildup. I get stable on either one, and tolerance isn't such a bad thing with these drugs; they still work in the background but don't get in the way.

Did you get high on Lyrica? Or was it effective for pain relief, maybe (?) If you don´t mind me asking.

I don´t have enough info about Lyrica, I just believed that it was a mild medication, not opiate that worked for some sort of pains..

That's interesting, how long were you on it for and at what dose?


Out of several opiates, benzodiazepines, and SSRIs/SNRIs that I've been dependant on over the years - I'd say that Pregabalin easily tops the list for horrific withdrawal symptoms, followed closely by Venlafaxine/Effexor.


If I forgot to take my morning dose I'd be in a pretty bad state of withdrawals by early afternoon, classically starting with a detachment from reality. It's horrible, but I guess we're all different.

How many days can I use lyrica in a row without suffering withdrawal? I'm currently on day 4, I'm using it to alleviate a phenibut withdrawal and a very mild short term benzo wd. I've been taking about 400-700mg a day.  Escalating as the tolerance builds. not using it to get high just to mask the wd from phenibut... but phenibut will give me wd (insomnia, depression for days) after only like 7 days use. How is lyrica?

My dr. gave me some sample packs of 50mg Lyrica today and a script I can fill if they help me. Never taken them before but he's trying to find something to help with neuropathy. Percocets and Muscle relaxers are helping some but I still hurt. I'm going give it a try! I've had neck surgery and have a titanium plate in my neck and multiple procedures on my back. So I know being completely pain free is just a dream!!

I am tapering off of my oxycodone, and was craving really badly last night.  After reading a lot here on BL, I thought I would try a Lyrica 150 mg, of which I have some left over from several years ago.  Wow!  I got a really weird high last night, basically passed out and had the most vivid dreams... one was of me trying to find oxy's and just having the worst time trying to get some.  I woke up and felt that drunk feeling that often comes with Lyrica.  I am trying it again this evening, and it is not as intense, so the tolerance builds quickly.  I threw 200 mg of gabapentin in as well.  I am trying to do anything to stay on my taper from the oxycodone.

I think you should preserve the use of lyrica for afterwards because it's nothing short of a godsend for withdrawals.

Thanks, baooozs, I appreciate the feedback.  I will definitely save them.  I think you know that I am anticipating changes at my pain management clinic.  Actually, I was told at my last appointment by my doc, who I like very much, that she was being replaced.  Due to the unknown, I want to be prepared for being cut off, and having to go through withdrawals, so I will keep them for later.

I've taken 3 50mg Lyrica today, I staggered them tho. 50mg first, 100 mg later in the day. I'm on Oxys too. 4 x's a day.  My Dr. Just switched me from hydro 10 to Oxys yesterday. We'll see what happens. I'm going to take 100mg tomorrow morning and see what happens. If my feet and legs don't swell, l'll keep trying the Lyrica. I'll let you know what happens. ?

anytime.


save as much as you can. if you can get your hands on hydroxyzine and clonidine you'll be feeling like a champion in the midst of withdrawal. it's almost cheating if you ask me.

Hi and thanks.

I've been using a few days on, 4-5 days and one day off where I use something else.

Sometimes I have two days off if I can.

I get really bad depression and anxiety but, I have just started a new higher dose HRT regime, and the HRT has helped my depression and anxiety a bit, as part of it was caused by lack of oestrogen due to my ovaries downing tools at age 42.

The HRT patch takes a few weeks to fully kick in like my last lower dose, so it's early days yet.

I am hoping to get days where I wont use, I felt ok this morning.

I have also just tapered off trazodone which I was using for 6 years, starting at 450mg, and gradually coming down to 0mg.

Even though it did fuck all for my depression, I am getting some withdrawals from it, depression and having to remind myself not to slip into negative thinking.

I am on 375mg lyrica today.

Up to now I have not had withdrawals from it, but I dunno how long they take to manifest.

It would be really nice to wake up in a good mood and not want any drug.

** 0Hello everyone!** first poster here on this forum..


I got a serious question here: can you combine lyrica ~250-300mg + 7.5mg imovane and then when all that shit has kicked in, i obviosly feel *very relaxed* atm.

The big question here is: Im sitting with some Changa( with 33%DMT) Extremely good quality on that shit, and im thinking if i can smoke some of this Changa/DMT too -

while being fucked from all the other stuff i have taken and that has already kicked in.


**Is it safe for me to smoke DMT while being under lyrica and imovane?** Can i die or something? any risks doin it while under these other influencing drugs?


**Thanks in beforehand


EDIT: i went truly YOLO with this since i couldnt find information on the net what happends when you mix this shit.

I can say it works JUST FINE. its AMAZING!!!

First time i try DMT.**

I stopped experimenting with it because one time the effect was a bit too much and it kept going.  But for relief of nerve pain, I find it to be almost magic.  I only have 25s and 75s (Well, I have a few 150s too but my prescription is 75s) so I keep it kinda low and only now and then.  Too many horror stories on this thread for me to toy with withdrawals.  In cases of nerve pain I have a 75 and maybe another later if needed but not usually.  If I wanted a small buzz, I'd probably take 150-225. If I wanted to get mildly fucked up (oxymoron?), 300-450.


My boyfriend swears that the next day after an isolated (therapeutic) dose,  his nerve pain is worse.  Just putting it out there in case anyone else felt that way.


I find lyrica is best when kept for the odd occasion.  The euphoria is nothing like Ecstasy but what is the same is this:

-tolerance builds quickly

-it's best saved for every now and then

-there can be a comedown or a withdrawal, depending on the person, dose and regularity of usage.

-it makes music sound better

-can give you that "pressure in the head" feeling that E/acid give.


The first time I took it I was weak in the legs and was stumbling all over the place.  Never got that back again.  IDK if I want to try.

I'm down from 600mg a day to 150mg a day. My ability to form coherent sentences has returned. Withdrawal side effects include aching body, sweating, depression, chronic insomnia, anxiety coupled with this very annoying butterflies in the belly feeling that just won't go away. 


I have three weeks left to go, then I'm free from it once and for all...just in time for me holidays. ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

Got prescribed this garbage for my anxiety, was looking to get xanax. started at 150mg a day, made me feel like shit and bloated so I called and got off of it right away. I got insurance and it still costed me $50, dont see any recreational use in this shit except maybe to take 3-400 mg for the day after a benzo binge to get some sleep, or maybe it does something in super high doses but I didnt care for it

Hi all.

I tried Lyreca in my friends house one night and it was a great feeling. I am a recovering alcoholic and would pick 600mg of these over any bottle. 

How do I go about getting them from my doctor or online ? I currently take mitrazapene on prescription @ 45 mg and I wonder if I should just say to my doctor that Lyreca or pregabalin help with my depression. I just came off 225mg of venlafaxine also. 

Any help would be appreciated.


Thanks in advance

Sourcing of any kind is discouraged, however, lyrica is scheduled for neuropathic pain & is also used off label for GAD & social anxiety.

Lyrica's expensive, if you're based in the UK your GP would most likely try other meds first. I was prescribed Lyrica for neuropathic pain, but not before I'd been through 6 months of daily gabapentin, co-codamol, codeine and naproxen. I'm not sure whether Lyrica would be presribed for depression over the likes of cheaper anti-depressants. 

I've never been offered Lyrica for anxiety, although I've been back and to my doctors for 5 years complaining of GAD. I mean, I even got a pack of valium thrown at me once...no mention of pregabalin. Very strange. 


I'd stay away from Lyrica anyhows...unless you wanna feel like you're getting dementia ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Hi all,


 I've used this site via Google for years but just signed up for  an account today. I'm 40+ y/o and safe to say I have tried most  everything out there, generally multiple times... not too familiar with the newer "designer" stuff  tho. Opiates have always been my weakness, and have been on benzo's  since I was 14. Currently prescribed 5mg of alprazolam and 30 mg of  diazepam daily. Also have plenty of Ambien IR, flexaril, seroquel,  neurontin, and adderall around. I was in a car accident 7 ears ago and  was left with a couple pf squashed discs and sporadic, horrible  sciatica. Most recently developed carpal tunnel syndrome symptoms,  scheduled to see a neurologist in a couple of weeks. Was given Lyrica  initially after my car accident and found no relief at all. No anything.  When the carpal tunnel stuff started I was given neurontin and worked  my way up to 600 mg 3x per day. It went from not helping at all to   aggravating the problem to the point I couldn't hold a cup or tie my  shoes. Nothing pleasant at all. Tapered off with minimal w/d. 


So,  here's the question I have today. I saw a commercial for lyrica earlier  and where I had tuned them out in the past, today I heard the  disclaimer that it had potential for abuse in patients with such a  history, and recalled I had a bunch of 50's and 100's stored away. After  reading the first 10 pages of this thread I decided to take 800 mg.  Opened the capsules and parachuted them. That was about 45 minutes ago  and no effect so far. Any suggestions on potentiators, I'm thinking of  taking a couple of benadryl, but with my other supplies, wondered if  any thing else may do better. I am at a time of the anniversary of the  passing of my fiance, and just want to feel something other than the  deep depression I've been going through the last week or so. I have  about 400 mg of oxycodone, which I am saving for a particular day coming up soon. I have a  huge tolerance to most everything I've tried, including op8's. I spent a  couple of years IV'ing the junk, and now won't go near a needle. Just  HOPING the 400mg will be enough for a nod, it will be questionable. been  taking 10 mg daily of the oxy, prescribed 40mg per day, but saved up  some for the special occasion. 


Ok, I'm rambling.  So.......Knowing the similarities to neurontin that Lyrica has. If  Neurontin never did anything but hurt my joints at 1800 mg per day, do I  have a chance of Lyrica producing anything pleasurable? I used to  really enjoy the alprazolam feeling before tolerance went so high, now I  feel nothing from it, just physically addicted. Thinking of taking a  half dozen 10mg flexaril...they are sitting here in front of me...also  thinking of taking maybe 100 mg of oxy, have enough I can do that  without getting into my 400mg stash....though 100mg on it's own doesn't  touch me. Too depressed to want to leave the house, but may be willing to go get  some beer if that would make a noticeable difference. I know alcohol accentuates many other substances. I'd just love to get that old xanax feeling I used to get. Stumbling around and blacking out sounds fine to me right now. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

^ You should bear in mind that 1,800mg of gabapentin (Neurontin) is probably not over the threshold for recreational effects. A lot of people, myself included, would probably take 2.5-3g with little to no tolerance to get the desired effects which tend to include energy, euphoria and thoughts and actions bordering on mania. There are some issues with gabapentin that many users are unaware of as well. The bioavailability fluctuates *wildly* with this drug, example: I have taken 3g on a completely empty stomach (in the evening, hadn't eaten anything all day) with no tolerance and experienced zero noticeable effects. On separate attempts, 3g would have me walking down the street, singing and dancing in generally high spirits. Consuming gabapentin after a meal high in lipids, or with say, a few tablespoons of peanut butter, will leave you with a much higher bioavailability, so you see how it can be hard to judge.


Pregabalin (Lyrica) is in a lot of ways, just a more potent, efficient and thus more predictable form of gabapentin. The similarities in effects are easy to notice in my personal experience. Pregablin produces the same energy and general euphoria of gabapentin, but has a quicker onset and seems to be rather uneffected by stomach contents. According to wikipedia the bioavailability of pregabalin is listed at greater equal to 90% while gabapentin is between 40% - 90%. That's a pretty sizeable difference. 


Just for reference sake, I take about 700mg of pregabalin as a recreational dose and that generally gets me where I want to be. One must be careful though, as tolerance builds remarkably fast with this drug, in much the same way gabapentin does. Breaks in between recreational doses should be observed, otherwise, diminished effects are going to be noted. Redosing in the same 24 hour period is to be discouraged as well...

Thanks Keif', feeling some more physical symptoms as time passes, a kind of lightness in my body is the best way I can think to describe it. I  haven't taken anything else yet. Also, I haven't eaten a thing today except one bottle of 350 calorie ensure about 9 hours ago. I'll get a few spoon fulls of peanut butter and see if that changes things any. I do appreciate your reply.

4 tablespoons of peanut butter and one of raw honey  (just for fun) and it's turned into something like a lightweight acid trip. Definitely an interesting feeling. Not quite what I was expecting, but I understand it treats everyone differently. I will certainly wait a week before trying it again, however I may get a couple more hundred mgs in me and see where that goes. spellchecker is a wonderful thing. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


Edit: Things have become much more interesting, music is giving me visions...very much like a good healthy dose of acid, yet I can control my thoughts and actions if neeeded, like when my mother showed up unexpectedly just now. She didn't seem to notice anything going on. Short visit fortunately.

I love lyrica the first time me and my girl both took 12- 75 mg pills a piece we both swore afterwards that we were speaking telepathically awsome buzz. Also has anyone tried shooting ambien I've done it a few times and also enjoyed this immensely

Glad that worked for you brother, I *never* consume gabapentin without some high-fat meal some minutes prior. The difference in effect is quite remarkable, unlike any substance I've ever had. I don't really take gabapentin anymore though, as I've been on pregabalin for a couple of months now and the cross-tolerance is what I would call "complete" between the two. The thing that I find hard to understand, is that with either of these drugs, I would never be able to abuse them long enough for any kind of "dependence" to set in; the effects wane too quickly which act as a natural deterrent against abuse. Just my own experience.

IT was quite an experience. There are still lingering effects today. Just feel a bit off kilter. But my balance is back, and I'm not having any more hallucinations. Finally took 50 mg of seroquel about 3am this morning and just woke up in my chair 11 hours later. It was certainly an interesting experience, and I imagine I'll try it again someday, but don't see it as anything I'll be doing with any regularity. It was definitely a hallucinogenic type thing, and I was walking like a drunk, knocked over a few things, but overall no damage done. I quit taking hallucinogens years ago, as I tend to end up in dark places in my mind, but this wasn't like that fortunately. All the same, I foresee it being a something I'll reserve for times when I have nothing to do for at least 24 hours, and am  not expecting any interaction with anyone else. The peanut butter made a world of difference, and a bit later I ended up eating a burrito, which is something I would never do on other hallucinogens, eating, that is.  I was taking both alprazolam and diazepam, throughout the evening, not out of necessity, but just thought it couldn't hurt. Thanks again  Keif' for the suggestion on the peanut butter, that was definitely the key to setting things in motion.

I just took 2 Fioricet this morning, and yesterday  took 600mg staggered, 300 at a time. I want to know if I should take the other six 100mg Lyrica I have...I also have suboxone, which I heard goes well with Lyrica, and klonopin.  I've just heard that people takeLyrica one day and get high and then the next day they take it and feel nothing...is this just something thats different for everyone?  Would the suboxone and fioricet (it has phenobarbital and caffiene) help at all?  I also have gabapentin, but I heard that might block the absorbtion of Lyrica, idk, just reading comments...I just wanna know if I will feel good taking 600mg (only my 2nd time taking Lyrica) a day after taking the same dose...but like I said I also have suboxone and benzos to potentiat or synergize the Lyrica.  So what should I do to get the best high?  I really want to work on my music today, I was up all night working on it and promoting and working on my website thanks to the Lyrica and Fioricet, and a little suboxone.  I want to repeat that experience today if possible.

I feel you man. I'm in 600 mg a day and I'm not acting right with my girlfriend and I'm feeling detached from emotions and sometimes saying stupid things. I have a Neurontin rx too. if I drop the lyrica, will the Neurontin hold me?

^Yep. Maybe increase the Gabapentin dose for a few days, iirc it's about a third of the strength of Lyrica. Anyone cmiiw?


I'm going on 48hrs of zero sleep here..


Then gradually lower the dose if you're trying to avoid any wd symptoms, or stabilise if it's for pain. 


For once I just couldn't be fucked reading more than two posts. Lol.

So this is my first time reporting my Gabapentin experience.  I've experimented with different dosages, staggering my doses, etc...


I had the most intense and enjoyable, and energetic, and productive experience yesterday.


I took 600 mg pills, broke them in half, drank them with an energy drink (Monster Iced Tea Rehab, black and red can)  and had a cookie after each dose.  It was a rather big, cheap store brand peanut butter/oatmeal cookie.  I did this 4 times over the course of about 2 hours, and about 2-3 hours later I was feeling intense energy surge and uplift of mood.  I ran home from my friends house without stopping for a breath, which is almost a mile (I can usually do this if I'm not taking other shit like when I used to take DXM all the time, or heroin, which I foolishly fucked around with for several months on and off)  and came home still with a ton of energy and ended up doing around 200 pushups, about 20-30 per set.  And in between I would sprint back and forth in the hallway, or just walk around the house like a caged tiger (Mike Tyson in the ring before the fight starts comes to mind) and then do more pushups, just to use this incredible surge of energy I had.  

Then I sat down, after taking a couple Klonopin and a shower, and worked on music for a play I'm supposed to do the soundtrack for (and am very intimidated by, but while on this Gaba I was like "Let's do it!") and got a shitload accomplished.  Then I found myself nodding off out of nowhere, realizing it was midnight, around 6 hours after having started to feel the real powerful effects of this rush.  I went to bed around 12:30, when I started feeling the stronger effects around 5:30-6:30.  


I slept the entire night, about a full 8 hours (which is very abnormal for me, I usually wake up 2-3 times a night and then lay in bed for 2 hours feeling like shit about my life before I get up) and I still feel that surge of energy and motivation, which is probably (most definitely) why I am writing this post.  


So for all you guys who say "Gabapentin/Neurontin has NO recreational value/potential,"  I am here to say I've had numerous recreational experience on it, if not just overall mental, physical and cognitive improvement from rather average doses of 1800-2400mg staggered over a couple of hours, 600mg at a time.  


Hope this is insightful.

I'm amazed at the sheer volume of lyrica people can take. 


I'm an absolute zombie for 12-18 hours from one 25mg tablet. 


Being well aware of how it affects me,  I took a capsule about an hour ago to knock me out on the tail end of taking meth, feeling nicely relaxed, I think I'll be able to go have a quick ciggie and I'll be asleep in no time!

Same with gabapentin for me. People taking multiple gram doses while 100-300mg make me sedated and stupid as a rock, but somewhat happy.

Never tried Lyrica though and don't know if I even want to...

Gabapentin, I'd just sit on my couch watching hours tick by... Pregabalin gives me a little energy on doses 450-600mg, above that is blackout time.

25mg ended up pretty much taking me back to baseline and I got a 4 hour nap in,  might leave it at that,  as I got a mild allergic reaction after a few days last time. 


My doc won't put me on Gabapentin as she thinks I'll have a reaction to it as well

A relative of mine is on Lyrica for pain. She does not realize how happy she becomes when she´s 'high'. I guess she has no idea this is used as a drug, not medicine. 

This is a 65 year old person who never in her life took drugs. In other words 100% naive. Zero tolerance.

As bad as it may sound, I love calling her when she´s medicated. She´s social and fun. I think the doctor should advise her.

That is really true. Pregabalin is a great medicine, but it can become evil and dangerous if you don't give it the respect it deserves.

Hey Lyrica users. I'm currently prescribed 900mg Gabapentin per day. How does Lyrica compare? Both effect wise, withdrawal wise, etc.

I've never had gabapentin but pregabalin  is supposed to be more euphoric and have worse w/d.

Are you asking for medicinal or recreational use? Given that it's scripted, I'll guess the first option. 


I was prescribed Gabapentin for years prior to pregabalin coming on the market. A while back now, when I took all my meds as ordered. Looking back, I wonder why I bothered with it. Because my PM Dr said it would help I guess :/


All I felt from it was absolute & utter exhaustion. My days seemed to fly by while I sat mindlessly on the couch, wouldn't even have been able to tell you what was on the tv. No pain relief though. Zip, zero, zilch, nada.


Then I went on holiday & didn't bother to fill that months prescription, it's pretty pricey here,(& I wasn't feeling any benefits), & I honestly didn't notice any withdrawl symptoms. I'd been taking 2400mgs in split daily doses.


Then I began lurking around BL & several other sites, & decided to hit my GP up to see if Lyrica would help with my leg pain. Mainly at night, well, when laying down,- I'd have these god damn, freakin, shooting, lightening bolts through the length of my legs. It was a miracle if I ever slept!


Hmm, this is getting lengthy.. So I told my Dr that my specialist suggested I switch from Gabapentin (which I didn't inform her of that I'd been completely off of for several mths), to Lyrica. She immediately printed the script.


I know opinions differ regarding onset, but for my leg pains & sleep, (bonus side effect), it worked almost immediate wonders!!


I've never taken it for lengthy periods, it's not a daily medication for me. I take it more like a prn, or when I'm going through a flare up of neuropathic pain. Weeks at a time at most, so no wds experienced.


I hear reports of tolerance rapidly building, so I keep it specifically for a specific type of pain. Unfortunately I do suffer from more than one. (Also handy for opiate wds, but that's another thread). 


Also, it's still a relatively young drug, there's only now a few reports emerging that it's not for long term use, & I'm not particularly inclined to be big pharmas guinea pig!


In saying this though, I wouldn't be without Lyrica. Compared to Gabapentin it's a completely different drug. Metaphorically, not literally, I know the "big brother" label. To me it's a handy med to have on hand.


I've never felt high or any euphoria from it, but a kind of "alls ok" with the world feeling. Like many others, depending on doseage, a bit of a calm, drunk feeling, liable to nod off if I'm comfortable & not being entertained. Or I use it as a sleep aid in higher doses.


Anyway, that's all I've got to say for now. Bring on pregabalin 3.0!

I also have mixed a decent amount of booze, benzos, and in some cases opioids at 1000 and even 2000mg+ doses but I don't endorse that especially since theraputic dose lyrica could have played a small role in my fentanyl OD.

There are a small number of threads for recovering addicts and people who have genuine "on label" questions but they fall into that 1% or less which is not what he was talking about. I guess if you have a lot available you should consider starting low, but a bottle of lyrica goes really fast when you are using it to get high more than once a week.

> Maybe the sensitivity thing has to do with what people perceive as the lyrica high. I notice a lot of people talk about very mild effects like slight mood lift and anxiety reduction. That sounds like every benzo dose I have ever taken and pretty boring. I guess those people fall into the group who find the benzo "high" recreational. I never have, and the appeal that lyrica had was that it can go beyond what any benzo can and I consider myself high only once the floor and everything around me starts undulating and I see colored lighting and become MDMA level social with a strong weightless feeling body high. For me that is only at 900mg+; At 450mg I might feel the same effects you consider a "high" from your lyrica experience. If you don't get the effects I describe then double your recreational dose and report back, you may have a very different opinion.

^Took time to respond as I hate it when kids experiment with shit & lk to the internet for answers.


The "spazzes" are bcos you've taken too much, as is falling asleep. 


Vicoden is not that hard to withdraw from surely? If need be just buy codeine otc.


Better than a "real" seizure as opposed to a "mini seizure" as you call them. Hopefully you have parents to check on you.

Pregaalin (in high doses) and Gabapentin (in very high doses) is an AMAZING set of drugs for opiate WD & it relives Amphetamine anxiety without killing the buzz, unlike benzo's! BUT I think it kills opiate high big-time...

First things first, there's a ton of statements and opinions etc that I would like to respond to, but I'll have to save that for later..


I will just give my overall opinion/experience with Lyrica (for now)


I first tried it back in probably 2009. Had no idea what it was or how it was supposed to effect a person. I began enjoying it the more times I tried it..and it'll definitely Fuck you up pretty bad if you take like 700mg at once without knowing how the dosing works. Long story short, I later would have a car accident that caused me a pinched nerve in my neck, which actually gave me peripheral nerve pain. Ironically I was fucked up on neurontin when I had the accident.


To this day, I am scripted neurontin after having switched back and forth between the two meds over the years. I only stuck with neurontin because I can make the bottle last quite a bit longer than the equivalent dosage of lyrica that I had been given. I personally think lyrica is the better of the two, although every doc I've spoken to recently is insisting they're both the same with treating nerve pain. Lyrica is 4x more potent and neurontin has terrible bioavailability.

I use Lyrica a lot, only at 300mg/day now. I discovered if taken with Vyvanse, it seems to last longer in combination. The Lyrica stretches the time between pain killer dosages.

I'm prescribed Lyrica for neuropathic pain associated with my lymphoma that's now in remission and it was a lifesaver for me coming off heavy oxy use for over a year from cancer treatment. Basically eliminated most of the withdrawal symptoms when I quit cold turkey and made it bearable

I took 150mg Lyrica early this morning, as I am tapering off my opiates, again for about the 5th time.  It was weird, though, I felt high, but no euphoria at all, fell asleep and now I feel anxiety about going out to get some food.  It kind of sucks. I think I will keep the rest of my Lyrica if/when I stop my oxy's completely or get cut off by Pain Management doctor.

Completely non abusable for me, but it does help my social anxiety a little and nerve pain in my back a lot (basically don't even feel anything while on). It does boost benzos however. I take 100 mg per day. But tried 300 once just to see if you get high.

Well, you're not going to feel as great from the lyrica if you're coming off opiates. It's leveling your system to whatever extent your body is feeling any withdrawal.


You say you felt high, but no euphoria? Aren't those sort of one in the same?

Hey Chris:  Thanks for the response... makes sense about the Lyrica just leveling out my system as I have cut my oxy usage by 33%.  As for saying I felt high... hmmm..how to explain??  I was a bit off balance when walking, sounds were distorted, music sounded better, and definitely not feeling like myself,  didn't feel like doing anything but sit on the couch, surf BL, and watch TV and felt anxious.    On my oxycodone, I don't experience any type of this high feeling... I feel euphoric, in that I feel  very happy, no worries, and have hope and motivation. I also have no problems mixing with others or being in public.    I will take euphoria over that high feeling anytime.

Yes, that's exactly how Lyrica feels. It sounds like you're trying to compare it's effects to that of opioids, which are very different experiences, as they work differently in the brain. Having said that, most people tend to become more sociable on lyrica..sounds almost like a marijuana type of paranoia that you get from it. Everyone's body chemistry is different. ![:-)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I'll get the first run on the board and add that my experiences with this drug as something that would get me 'buzzed' were conclusively busted. I experimented at various doses up to 300MG and found for me there wasn't anything to go back for which is rare as I react very typically to almost every substance I have used. My housemate is on 300MG/ day with MS Mono and it seems to be a safe effective medicine that works for its designed purpose.

Newb here. Prescribed 100mg of lyrica per day for severe fibromyalgia. I've been taking it for a week (as prescribed) and so far it's not doing anything, although there were unpleasant side effects (wooziness and clumsiness) for a few days that have since worn off, so I'm assuming my body is getting used to the dosage and I'm developing a tolerance. 


Pain has been horrible all week, for no apparent reason. I woke up today feeling like shit. It's been really hard for me to get out of bed because I just don't want to do anything. So, kind of on an impulse, I decided I needed not to be sober. (ftr, I just got certified for medical marijuana, and I'm waiting for my registration to go through.) So, I took 300mg of my lyrica. 


WOO, it fucked my shit right up. In an okay way, I felt pretty good, aside from the whole stumbling and uncoordinated thing. And I managed to banish some of my self-hatred and anxiety! Not that I'm advocating this. I'm not. 


So the problem is, now I'm coming down, and I feel all woozy and I can't focus on anything, and I'm wondering how y'all deal with lyrica comedown? I might try to titrate and take a lower dose...I don't want to burn through it and end up without any to take therapeutically. :x

My friend gets these on concession for 6 bucks a box and I never heard of it before. She gets boxes of 56 caps of 300 mgs I believe. First time I started with 600mgs while drinking and it didn't too much just somewhat of a relaxant. Took a couple more and it just aided with the boozing process and made us a bit more wobbly and relaxed.

Quoting you in response to my post[http://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads/532741-The-Lyrica-(Pregabalin)-Mega-Thread-v-2-0?p=13248877#post13248877](https://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads/532741-The-Lyrica-(Pregabalin)-Mega-Thread-v-2-0?p=13248877#post13248877)


Do be careful with this drug. Falling asleep? I don't think that's it. It's like a 0.5-1 second blackout. If I'm playing playstation my hands will shake violently for a second and I'll drop my controller. I recently got my refill and went through it again. Though this time the "blackout mini-seizures" became more and more pronounced as time progressed. Eventually leading to a much larger "blackout". The last thing I remember was I was playing playstation. Next thing I know, I'm outside my upstairs window on the roof of the house trying to get back inside. My right eye was busted up as well as multiple scrapes up and down my legs (I presume from stumbling and falling on the roof shingles). Busted my knee up pretty good too, it was bleeding pretty badly. No idea how much time had passed from the time I blacked out till I came to. I do know that the window had a large A/C unit in it so I had to climb out over that. I've been trying to go through my past broadcasts on Twitch to see if I can find the moment I "went on vacation". The other thing I dislike is the time between highs. After my 1-2 day high it's like the pills don't get me high at all. I can eat 60 of them and not feel anything. Guess I need to just chill for a few days. Maybe only take on the weekends.

Sixty lyrica? At any mg dose that is insane. What's your purpose now? Is it still the Vicodin or are you just trying to get high?


Tolerance will build rapidly, but also having a break will recapture that initial feeling.

I doubt a lot of doctors would find it odd that somebody would want to switch from Gabapentin to Lyrica. In a doctor's eyes, Lyrica is still "the newer, better Gabapentin" so it would make perfect sense for someone who's already profiting from Gabapentin to ask for a drug that's supposed to be even more therapeutically valuable.

And even if you're a "junkie", cases of Lyrica abuse are few and far between compared to benzos (many patients actually find the drug unpleasantly impairing when they're first started on it, and to a regular user, they are nowhere near as pleasant as a benzo, even at extremely high doses).


Plus the drug has already gone generic (atleast where I live), so it likely wouldn't be a money/insurance issue either.

If you are in the US get ready for sticker shock since there isn't a generic for at least a couple more years.

Hi I would like to relate my experience and see if anyone has any comments/info for me. I started taking Lyrica after being kicked off my Fentanyl patch for smoking pot with a drug contract. I didn't know that I would get kicked off, since I had told everyone in my Dr's office that I smoked. Anyway, I had horrible w/d's, because I was on 150mg Fentanyl every 72 hours and had to go straight turkey.


It lasted a few months, when in desperation I asked a family member if I could get some Lyrica to try. That family member said yes as they were in process of switching and had been reduced, plus had refills. So I started taking it and it was like BOOM!, suddenly all of my w/d symptoms were gone. I asked my Dr. to prescribe these for me, and the Dr. did. I was put on 600mg a day. 


 Then a month or two following that my Dr. decided that it was okay to put me back on the Fentanyl as it had been awhile and I had tried many different things and wasn't getting the help I needed. I was warned that if I failed another piss test I would never be able to get anything from them. I quit smoking pot that night after going home and applying my new patch. I was VERY happy to be back on the patch and quitting pot didn't bother me and it has been over a year and I don't miss it and haven't touched it since.


Anyway right before I had been put back on the patch I was on 300mg pills of the Lyrica but wanted to get switched to a different dose, say 750mg per day so that if I wanted to, I could take one less in case I didn't need the full 600. I wanted some ability to vary my dosage. So my Dr. either not paying attention or whatever actually prescribed me 900mg per day in this order= 3x150mg in a.m, 2x150mg in afternoon, and 1x150mg at night. 


I've actually been okay at that level since, some days I need the full 900, usually the day that I am scheduled to change my patch, or the day before. I have many different medical issue's I am not going to describe them all because they are irrelevant to what I have come to say/report. 


But for the past month or maybe 2 I've actually taken 7x150mg of the Lyrica per day, and with the Fentanyl obviously. I am getting to the point where I really want to start getting off the Lyrica. I don't have swelling of hands or feet, but I have ballooned in weight from 230 up to 350lbs. I have always been big, but when I was on the Fentanyl before I got kicked off for smoking I had started losing weight making my way from 420 max down to the 230 in like a year and a half.


Then being on the Lyrica, I just plumped right up again and it's all in my gut. I had problems with constipation before but now they are horrible, I've had to add an r/x for colace along with Polyethelyne Glycol (sp?). I have asthma but it's very light, but on the Lyrica, especially when I go to bed, I wheeze very lightly and when I wake I have tons of built up phlegm and sputum. I've also started getting sinus headaches, on or off the Lyrica. Then on top of that, my skin, especially my hands are dry as dust and constantly is peeling and bleeding. I also have a finger nail where the cuticle just fell off. This was over a month ago and it still hasn't grown back. So I am going to try and find a way to slowly taper myself off the Lyrica, and then I (hope), I will get one or two refills and give them to my wife for an occasional usage, because they do help some of the pain issues plus I sleep great.


I am sorry this is such a mess/sloppy, I've just been thinking about this for so long and wanted to get everything out before I forgot. So I guess tl/dr would be: off Fentanyl r/x'd Lyrica; raised dose to 900mg per day; put BACK on patch AND still with Lyrica but want to get off Lyrica because of some weird side effects.


Anyway if anyone has any advice or comments I welcome them. My body seems to crave the Lyrica in shorter time spans now, every 4-5 hours rather than 7-8, plus the sinus pain is unbearable.

^Well in saying that you should be fine. Codiene has a ceiling effect, 

Mixing tram also does. Adding lyrica I don't know, do you hsve experience here?


It sounds like quite a benign cocktail., but that is from an ongoing drug user. I don't know your exact circumstances ..

Well i do codeine everyday 600mg that's my ceiling affect , most people say that ceiling affect is between 400-450. But I know for a fact 600mg feels a lot stronger then 450mg .

i have done lyrica many times 500mg gives me a good high by itself . I am aware that if you take more then 400mg of tramadol you are at risk of a seizure . But the lyrica is good for preventing seizures ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png) .

Beware anyone taking this stuff. I took it recretionally, and I am now addicted. I didn't take it daily, thinking it worked like a short acting benzo, but it stays in your system, and if you do it more than once a week, you are on the way to getting hooked.

I have permanent diarrhoea, and we are talking the kind that you do in your sleep, which isn't a very nice way to wake up at 6am

The headaches are terrible and not to mention the depression and anxiety.

I took it because I was sick of being in a bad mood, and i didn't feel like the sober life was working for me, because of my moods, so I self prescribed and now I am tied to them. If I miss a dose, i know about it.

If this post helps just one person change their mind about doing this drug, then it has helped someone.

my Dr. got back and didnt give me the GO to use; however, I did mention I lost my gaba (90 day supply) and he gave me an early refill, ha. he knows I am a junkie but still did it; he also knows my GF is currently living in CA and I told him I went to visit her and left all my meds there, so I got all my meds in advance, not just gaba, but the rest are nothing special, so oh well. at least I have an 90 day supply of gaba in advance to go along w/ my month and a half supply I still have left. I SHOULD be able to always be ahead of the game from here on!

does anyone know what I would be paying? I am located in MA and I have Mass Health - anyone else in the same boat? what is the script $$ here in the US!? below is what my Dr. wrote back - saying they'd DO IT but giving me a heads up and rather just scripting. they did give me a script for GABA and said if I have any complaints to let them know and they will make the switch. 


here is what I was sent. 


but Lyrica is a much more expensive medication and insurance companies will often only cover it if patients "fail" treatment with gabapentin, meaning that they don't have any clinical benefit. If you felt like gabapentin wasn't working for you, we could potentially try switching, but it is possible that it would be more expensive, or that your insurance company would argue against paying for it.

Ok so a new user here, but was opioid and benzo dependant for 7 years, a bunch of snowboarding/skating injuries finally got to me by 30.. PM Drs pumped me all the way up to 4 80OCs (eventually OPs, meh), and 240 30 Roxy and 120 15mg oxy a month.. Well granted I was dating the RN he liked but even after I broke up with her always gave me extra shit for no reason. Anyway long story short I tapered myself and used the RDD in Michigan to get off everything. It worked well. Was 100% about 6 weeks later and out for the worst of the WD.. Well after 2 years clean circumstances occurred and I relapsed and went on a 2 month 270mg roxy down to 160mg of OP80s the last week.. Well started going into WD, got some tramadol and took about 300 mg once or twice a day for 4 days. Tapered down to 150 last day. I got a RX or Lyrica. Day one off 150mg felt that great buzz and all WD went away. Also I have a high benzo tolerance, been on them for 11 years and I can take 3mg IR and not notice. My question is how long can I take the Lyrica without having to WD from that. It has been 8 days since last OP and 4 days since last tramadol. Right now taking 300mg every 12 hours and no WD symptoms. This is day 4 on Lyrica with Tramadol being the last opiate 4 days ago. Just looking to get clean again and any help would be appreciated. Scoured pages of thread but couldn't find a specific answer. I was thinking 5-8 days at this dose then 2-4 days at half or less. Would I get any WD symptoms from it? Any experience appreciated.

**I can't get high off gabapentin! What am I doing wrong?**


i took about 10 x800 mg tablets and I took about 6 lyricas. And I'm not high or anything. What's wrong with me. I've also been taking gabapentin as prescribed for years. Do you get a tolerance?

Is there a tolerance for taking gabapentin or lyrica to get high?

yes, once the tolerance is there you no longer get the same feeling, which is why they tell you to take it every other day. 


even w/ a tolerance I still think I feel "better" on gaba, even at my 1600/MG dose. I took 3200/MG today and felt great! its not a HIGH but just an overall "sense of well being" lol

This is what I would recommend for you:


1) 3 grams Valerian capsules 3 times a day

2) L-orenthinine & L-arginine combo 4-6 3 times a day.

3) DLPA 2 capsules 3 times a day.


Taken with a good diet - mostly fruit and nourishing/non-toxic food. This should let you wean off very quick without discomfort. Good luck.

And taper, taper and taper basically treat it like a benzo and go slow. What dosage were you taking anyway? 


I did about a 4 month taper when I came off. I was on it daily for 3 years, 150mg the first year and 200-300mg the last two. I made the mistake of dropping too fast when I first started and it caused a lot of physical pain, much worse than went through benzo w/d a year before. When I finally jumped  I was at 12-13mg.  


Also "Gotu Kola" has helped some people  with lyrica w/d but I didn't really notice much of a difference the few times that I tried it.

Tolerance builds faster than any drug I have known.

Also, there are reports out there of people who have had bad reactions to neurontin, lyricas poor cousin, and there was even a court case, as the makers of neurontin didn't own up about the suicidal depression and horrible side effect in some users.

I started getting bad side effects when my dose crept upto the 300-450mg range.

a court case where they didnt own up? how do u know it was only the neruotin, tho? couldnt be anything else making that person think things like that besides neurotin? what were your bad side effects? I take a hefty dose, so no worries on my side. 


today I took about 3200MG of neurotin and felt BETTER than good all day.

I have a decent Benzo and opiate tolerance and I too 300 mg of lyrica and It made me feel a little drunk and very easy going and I seemed to enjoy something a little more. I took it at 7pm by 10:30 I was out like a light I also took 2mg of klonopin but I woke up at 5am and 7 am totally dizzy and out of it. I then woke up late for work at 930 and as I was driving it felt like I took about 5 shots of booze and took a couple hits of weed. I didn't realize it lasted so Long. When I closed my eye it was like I was seeing visions. Very interesting drug. I used the higher dose to take a night off my prescribed Oxy so I could Have a bowel movement.

Does anyone have a script to both Lyrica and Gabapentin at the same time? I managed to get one from one doctor and one from another. I have taken them both so much, that I take one or the other based on my mood. I do agree that the Lyrica wins and if you like them both like I do, it's a pain in the ass if you cycle them too quick. There are other reasons as well.

I am def. going to try and get my script moved over to Lyrica once I go see my neurologist in December. they mention that its typically not covered, which would suck, but i have a great insurance and I THINK they would surly cover it; I asked my Dr./Nurse over email but neither have returned any info. 


we'll see but I'd like to get some Lyrica; right now I am gabapentin or Phenibut; sometimes I take both in the same day/night (6AM and 6PM).

From what i read Pregabalin is not gabaergic and effects glutamate and norepinephrine transmission. Although an intoxication does occur the moodlift with lyrica is much stronger than benzos and on parr with opioids. You don't have to enjoy benzodiazepines(i find them boring unless potentiating opioids) to enjoy lyrica. The biggest problem with lyrica is tolerance, after 1 day i'll need up to 2 grams to get anywhere, maybe i've a natural tolerance though. Imo the guideline dosages are a fucking joke, 2 75mg caps a day lmao, in the states some get 1 50mg cap. Not even perceivable AT ALL at these doses. For those noobies curious to try, don't bother with anything less than 300mg, i think the majority will probably need more.

 In Canada pregabelin is not controlled as well as many otc codeine  prodructs "That Do Not Contain Caffeine". I'm prescribed generic  pregabelin 75mg caps. I found the best combo for me is 6 75mg caps and  smoke thc will give you the best giddy feeling combo compared to any of  other mentioned combos. That was my initial dose as far as tolerance is  concerned(which instantly builds after 1st dose after 20 day  abstinence). I was so perma smiled and giddy after a few joints and 6  75mg caps. I went to leave my apartment and show my brother in law the  way out to the parking lot. On the way down the elevator must have hit  button 4 instead of 1. We left the elevator thinking it was the 1st but  it was the 4th. Every floor is identical so just walking around to the  back of the floor is usually the back doors to the parking. We walked  around the fourth floor literally for 15 mins until my bro in law got  mad and said" It's your damn apt and you don't even know how to leave. I  said lets split up and I went around the corner and saw 4 marked on  elevator. I crumbled in un controllable laughter. (You know the laughter  you got when you were young on mushrooms or other things that could  paste a perma smile associated with laughing at a rock on the ground).

 I  quickly ran to find my bro in law and hit the ground laughing  uncontrollably telling him it was the 4th floor. I haven't laughed this  hard since it was a teenager and I could definitely feel the pregabelin  and the thc just blew it into perma smile mode.I would say the THC is  the best combo with pregabelin compared to what you are trying above  mentioned especially booze which I never combine with pills. Booze is  the deadliest organ killer out there.

 In Canada you order pregabelin up to 30grams from known chemical sites and it will be at your door in 2 days.

Today  I'm taking Mersydol(425 acetaminophen,10 mgs codeine phosphate and 5mg  (doxylamine succinate)the sleep aid which is only sleep ingredient with  succinate in canada). The others like unisom,sleepeze,etc have a  terrible ingredient which triggers unstopable restless legs you have  ride out in horror.  

 I use CWE for 20 Mersyndol tabs giving  slightly 200mgs codeine phosphate plus most likely the succinate which  actually helps anxiety with no restless legs at all. 

The problem for  me is I have a 10 gram bag of pregabelin and don't know how to measure  the mgs. I use a butter knife and scope up a little mound on the tip of  the knife. I also took 4mgs of klonopin. I have a great active buzz with  no worries and tonnes of motivation.

 This is my third day of my  pregabelin and just a little worried about the quantity of pregabelin  intake which I don't know how to measure properly especially if I start a  weaning process. Anyway I feel like a million bucks but good ol THC is  the best combo of constant laughter I haven't experienced in 20 yrs. I  haven't tried the naproxen yet. I only based my butter knife scoop on  what I scraped with a card from 10 75mg pregabelin caps powder.

 Any tips on how to measure doses from a 10 gram mound of pregabelin powder which is uncontrolled in Canada.

Personally I easily feel this stuff at 150-300mg assuming no tolerance. But like others said tolerance builds quick and once it does you're talking much higher doses to get a recreational or even medical effect (for anxiety) and the withdrawal is no joke. I was scripted 150-300mg a day. When I got off it I tapered quick but used benzos when I stopped the pregabalin and those helped a lot especially with the insomnia and rebound anxiety.


Getting a script for this in the UK is almost as easy as getting SSRIs, for some reason the NHS hands this out no problem but hates scripting benzos. Pregabalin is much more abusable than benzos as far as I'm concerned. Possible more addictive too due to rapid tolerance and dependence buildup with similar withdrawals at the end of it.


Worth trying as a rare treat just don't make a habit of it. You want to avoid the wd trust.

How good is Lyrica when used recreationally? What about it makes you feel any good effects from the drug? Someone I know gets prescribed a 3 month supply of Lyrica at a time but refuses to take it because it doesn't ease their pain at all.


With this being said, what is a good first time dose for someone with no tolerance?

It feels like benzos but with a body high similar to opiates and a head high similar to being very stoned. Decent stuff. Numbs your body almost like coke too.


Good recreational dose for the first time would be 300mg. If you want to be more cautious start off taking 150mg, wait a few hours, then take another 150mg if the first dose isn't doing anything for you. Keep in mind pregabalin does take a few hours to kick in.

Thank you for this. Is there anything I can take to decrease the waiting time? I'm gonna start off with a middle dose of 200mg. How long should I be expecting to be high?

Not that I know of, you just have to wait it out. 200mg seems like a sensible dose. Expect to be high for 3-5 hours.

I'm in Ontario Canada and I can just order pregabalin,gabapentin,excitolam...no sure spelling from known chemical research site here and 30 gram powder arrives in 2 days. I decided to take the pregabalin route while I'm tapering off klonopin. I just dont know how to measure properly. I just put some powder on tip of butter knife 3 times daily and nasty klonopin psychosis and crazy thoughts of my life in the past are gone. These horror stories of Lyrica dts are scaring me now. I was always looking for a magical formula to ease these these klonopin hell. 42 days of no sleep and slowly crawling up my spine from starting in sciatica 1st. I've been on 8 to 10 mg of klonopin for 6 years plus the odd valium small script I get a month. I've tried it all beleive me.....kratom,herbal remedies ,vitamins,good food,gaba,valerian,b complex,exersise. Tried methocarbanol ,no stimulants and now I'm using pregabalin and I'm down to 4mgs a day. What a mess if this pregabalin dt stories.

Lyrica is an absolute god send for nerve pain. I got into an accident and it has helped the nerves heal, stopped the constant tingling and pins and needles, and cut down on a majority of the neuropathic pain, all at only 100mg! I would take more but I'm taking rx-ed benzos/soma for muscle spasms.

That's mixing CNS depressants. Consider it the same as mixing opiates with benzos. Potentially very dangerous. I don't recommend doing it for HR purposes but if you do make sure to use only a very low dose of the oxy. I also recommend using pregabalin on its own first so you know what it's like and how you react to it outside of a combo.


If you want to make sure you're not overlapping (smart idea) wait a day to be safe. I always find pregabalin has after effects for about 12 hours after the primary effects have worn off but the next day shouldn't interact too much. Pregabalin only has six hours half-life.

I decided to take the pregabalin route while I'm tapering off klonopin. I just dont know how to measure properly. I just put some powder on tip of butter knife 3 times daily and nasty klonopin psychosis and crazy thoughts of my life in the past are gone. These horror stories of Lyrica dts are scaring me now. I was always looking for a magical formula to ease these these klonopin hell. 42 days of no sleep and slowly crawling up my spine from starting in sciatica 1st. I've been on 8 to 10 mg of klonopin for 6 years plus the odd valium small script I get a month. I've tried it all beleive me.....kratom,herbal remedies ,vitamins,good food,gaba,valerian,b complex,exersise. Tried methocarbanol ,no stimulants and now I'm using pregabalin and I'm down to 4mgs a day. What a mess if this pregabalin dt stories.

 So anyone gimmee a tip on my 5yrs vs. dosage vs. exact combo vs. nightmare stories. 8mg klonopin clonazepam 5yrs+Tried detoxing acutely and made it to day 42 with no sleep and a pipe coming out of my spinal mid section.Now I have a 10 gram bag of pregabelin from chem site down the highway from me. I'm hearing the Lyrica and what I got (10gs of lab made generic pregabelin..who know the quality???)has worse dt's than klonopin???? I'm down to 4mgs of klonopin right now. To combat the feeling of being on fire I just scoop a pinch on end of butter knife. I noticed big change in appetite , Which pregabelin is known for. Just scared now though.

 I know I'm a greenlighter but any personal stories to tell me what I'm in store for a maybe a better success path to take.

Thanks,

I decided not to take the Lyrica because of this. I had already dosed a 20mg oxycodone pill, so it was too late to alter the dose and it wasn't really "low" to me. So thank you for the helpful advice! I always try to ask for an opinion as well as doing internet research..


Anyways, I decided to take the Lyrica tonight. Dosed 300mg around 10:30, haven't taken anything else today besides a few bong rips of weed. When should I be expecting minimal effects? Really don't want to be up all night as I have school. This is my first time recreationally using it. Might take another 100mg soon.


Update; it's after midnight now. I took another 200mg a few minutes ago. I'm not really noticing anything either, but my roomate who took some Gabapentin is passed the f*ck out.

At this point you will probably feel mashed when you wake up. That's what happens to me when I take pregabalin at night. You'll wake up a bit dizzy, body will feel nice, mood lifted, feeling relaxed.

Cannabliss, I have a high tolerance to anything medicinal apparently, - now don't do as I do, but just saying I've been prescribed pregabalin (600mg) + oxycontin (200mg), at the same time. Drs think it's safe... But that's just me m'k?


It's been perfectly safe for me since day one. HR reasons though, pls don't try these amounts.


Hawk,- don't overestimate what may happen coming off pregabalin. 


I started with Gabapentin, paid a shitload for it monthly, 2400mg daily in split doses, then I thought this is just not helping anymore after a cpl of yrs.


My script ran out, I didn't bother to refill, & no probs at all.


A few months later, lyrica came onto the pbs, I told my GP my PM doc thought I'd developed a tolerance to Gabapentin & I should switch to lyrica. Little did either of them know of had months off.


Started at 150 twice a day, upped to 600mg. And I truly have no prob when I don't take it.


At times I won't take it for several weeks, nothing bad happens,- to me anyhow. Don't let other ppls experiences scare you. 


Good on you for getting off the kpins!

It's 6:45 in the morning and sure enough, I'm feeling off. I opened my eyes and just looked around and my body just feels like it's on a first plateau DXM trip. I almost fell over standing up, and walking seems more difficult than it should be. It feels really trippy honestly. It's a great feeling. I was tempted to take a few as a booster to keep the feeling going throughout the day, but decided not to. 

Oh, I smoked some resin to increase the euphoria/body high. It worked too well. Let's see how I can get through my classes today...

 Thanks for the advice. I get 30gram bags of pregabelin with no rx here in canada. I can't wait to hit 90 days with no klonopins. Then I'm gonna measure out my pregabelin doses and wind them down. Wonder how the quality of the noname brand chem site pregabelin is????? I get the side affects. I can eat like a pig for one its crazy. I get tonnes of energey and can stay up all nite. Only downfall is I think that it's interfering with my libido.............anyone????

Told you. Nice way to wake up ain't it? And yeah it is surprisingly trippy. If you close your eyes on a high enough dose you should get CEVs too, at least that happens to me especially if weed is added to the mix.

Oh it was great. But the trippy feeling  didn't last very long. Maybe because I was coming down from the resin so the Lyrica went away too. I kept stumbling over myself, hahaha. It's weird though because I took 600mg yesterday and didn't feel a thing, but my balance was really off and it just felt... weird. Why didn't I feel anything? I think I'll wait a few days to dose again.

Tolerance skyrockets very quickly. Wait about a week before you dose again and it should be mostly reset.

I don't find any tolerance to pregabalin. But then again, I don't take it every day. More as a prn med, which others find strange.


Even so, maybe every second day...I use it for leg pains, when it feels like I have shooting pains through my leg bones.


Stacking works well if you don't have to drive or be anywhere. I, liked others, typically find the onset to be around an hr & 1/2 . Once I get the feels I add another 4-600mg.


Above that I just black out, & Ive heard some  pretty funny stories of grown men hitting the concrete like a cardboard cutout after large doses.


So, IME tolerance never builds

^yeah that's pretty much my experience too RTP. I've been on 300mgs per day on average for 12months, once you've been on it for a while, 300mgs becomes baseline. My Father in law is a paraplegic, he's prescribed 300mgs morning and night for a total of 600mgs a day and it no longer has those wobbly effects perhaps a little peripheral fuzz but otherwise baseline. Well I'll take 600mgs on top of my usual 300, so 900mgs for a bit of mong time on Pregabalin. For me it takes 2hrs before I feels.

I have a horrible headache at this very time.  I took 150 mg Lyrica last night and followed it several hours later with 300 mg gabapentin.  I was trying to go a long time between oxycodone doses and I was at 15 hours without oxy when I took the Lyrica.  I believe the headache came from the Lyrica, as it started early this morning, and continued to increase in in intensity.  By early afternoon,   I felt I had to take the oxy, along with aspirin, and generic midrin (prescribed for migraine and/or tension headaches) and the headache is still here.  This is not the first time Lyrica has given me a headache.

what is a script costing here in the states of Lyrica? I am thinking I am going to make the switch; I have Mass Health Insurance - they are great. I pay $3.50 to fill my script of 56/bupe/mo and $0 to fill my 3 month scripts of gabapentin and keppra.

Hello all. I am using my Lyrica as a way to get off Percocet. Today, I felt a little crappy, and took 600 Mg and at least 600 Mg of Gabapentin. I only get 60, 150 Mg Lyrica pills a month. That's just to jump off the Percocet. I was on that for only 15 days. I am also on 20 Mg Oxymorphone ER a day and I think I want to taper off that also. I honestly don't know where I am at opiate wise. I hope I can use the Lyrica to taper. Peace all.

Opiates are only 7days to 10 of hell. 7 or less for you man. Just kill one opiate at a time eg.percocet. Jessh man at least you got Oxymorphone. Try cold turkey from 10 80mg oxycontin which I tried to beat with a case of beer and a bag of grass.LOL!!!! I almost died when my lungs filled with water had phone in hand for 911 luckily. Your dt's will be nothing man, Ride a bike or do some light excersise. Force yourself no matter how hard it takes with no motivation. I find bikin the best to kick opiates and create a sleep.

>  You have the same script as me but I have to order more online (legal in canada)to combat central nervous system on fire during clonazepam dt's. I'll be home free at day 90. I just take a scoop on tip of knife from 30g bag of pregabelin 3 times a day to fend of the worst dt's ever. No sleep for 42 days. You'll be fine man. You're home free with percs and 20mg oxy morphones. Eliminate percs for your script os 30days pregabelin 30 days no percs. Then wait a month and do the same for the oxymorphone. Opiate pain gone in 7 days tops for you. Then get down to just using pregabelin. You'll feel so much better opiate free.
> 
>  The question now is that I don't know what the pregabelin withdrawals are like. I'm scared. I'm using way higher amounts than you to get through clonazepam 8mg/day 5yrs of use. I'm using a 30g bag of pregabelin from company in my province. I HAVENT KICKED THESE DEADLY CLONAZEPAMS AFTER 5 SERIOUS TRYS. I make it to around day 42 after no sleep for 40 days it's trying to leave but it crawls up your nervous system. I cant take it and fall off wagon. You can't get comfortable in any position cause your skin is crawling and it feels like a fence post is coming through your mid sections nervous system in the spine. So I'm hoping to use high doeses of pregabelin to hide the hell. Hope that story of hell will make you get through your dt's better.

Thanks man for the reply. I know it isn't that big of a deal, but I have been taking diffrent things for a long time. That's why I was a little scared. I appreciate your honesty. As far as you go, you can't mega dose Lyrica in powder form. The Clonazepam has to be titrated, in your case slowly. Slow like one 8th of a milligram a month. That sounds crazy, but that's how slow or even slower some people need to go. If you can handle a little faster, then go for it. I found the slower the better. With withdrawaling from Lyrica you can go a little faster . Thanks for your advice.

For sure, I had to cut back on the pregabalin and now I only take it at night. (150mg) but I am taking it with 20mg of amitriptyline, and my sleep has never been better! No more waking up every other hour. But I do not take the pregabalin during the day ever now. I believe the amitriptyline is abolishing the headaches I would have normally had

Lyrica/Pregabalin is weird. I have found it partially beneficial for opiate withdrawal. Otherwise I could hang at 600 mg /day for regular pain. ^^ I'm going to try just at night. I'll see if that makes a difference in general.

There shouldn't be any issues with combining these two drugs at the doses you're describing. Everything seems within reason.

I take 2mg Xanax at night with pregabalin.  And so far I am still here. So I don't think there is an interaction.

Pregabalin and temazepam synergize great together  so I would imagine Xanax would as well.

They have decent synergy. Alone the Xanax, is calming, and I usually get pretty tired. 

Lyrica actually makes me feel pretty good alone, but I get headaches with lyrica about 4-5 hours later.

Xanax and lyrica together is nice and synergetic for me, I don't get tired, and also do not get a headache when taken together.  I think the Xanax takes away the headache from the lyrica. And the lyrica takes away the sedation from the Xanax. 

Which I find strange, since many people I know who have been prescribed lyrica for neuropathic disorders, get a sedating feeling, and dizziness from it. I was prescribed lyrica for an off label purpose - anxiety. 

It is synergic for me, but everyone has such different experiences with both drugs.

In the short term quite. It is physically addictive and tolerance builds almost as fast as psychedelics.

I just read some studies on PubMed that concluded lyrica can cause cognitive deficits and coordination problems. Most notably, people scored high on the Portland neurotoxicity scale. Any thoughts from lyrica users? I just started taking this med yesterday (50mg) and while it worked wonders for my pain, I'm a student so cognition is kind of important :/

I thought lyrica just makes it harder for your brain to form new synapses, but that it doesn't really kill the neurons.

Yup, imo it's safe. I'm combining it a lot. Actually it's going to potentiate each others effect and pregabalin kinda takes the edge of almost every drug.

I've wrote it on here before and ill write it AGAIN! 


I am scripted 1600MG Gabapentin; I am scripted based on seizures, not pain. 


I TRIED to get upgraded to Lyrica rather than Gabapentin; I told the Dr. I've been having MORE seizures, which is true. but rather than upgrade my Gaba or move me to Lyrica, he just added another 2kMG of Keppra, which is a better anti-seizure drug from what people tell me, right? anyone have any info on that? I've been having seizures for the past 4 years and always told Keppra is the BEST seizure drug, so its always been my go-to. but me, being a junkie/addict, always wanted to add things that may make me feel a bit "better", ya know? so I eventually got on Gabapentin and it only lasted so long before it became a NOTHING and is just something I MUST take nowadays so I do not go through WD"s or have a seizure due to an instant stop. 


does anyone use Lyrica for seizures? not sure if it is even worth it to go for another push on the Dr. to see if I can get them. 


oh well, I am done.. unless someone tells me different.

^^.  I agree with that. I don't find it hard to use for multiple purposes. As far as people comparing it to multiple drugs, I find it feels like what you think it feels like. I have felt like speed/opiate, feeling, and a ghb/ketamine feeling from it.  It depends on factors such as how fast and how much you dose at a time. I've had 1200mg to 1500mg feel like K, but 600mg feel speedy/less inhibition/. Most definately great pain killing dose is 300mg-600mg.

I just got off a 7 day break and had a pain level at a heavy 8/10. I dosed 600 mg an hour ago and the pain level is currently a 4/10. I have a tolerance to 15mg Opana/twice a day. Not too bad. Lastly. I don't have seizures but IMO, Lyrica is focused where Gabapentin feels more spread out, covering more of your lobes. Hope this made sense. Time for another 300-600mg. Later I'll add Clonazepam and Temazepam.

Lol I only have to start the conversation with "Now that Lyrica I was on.......and the conversation is interrupted when he puts a script in my hand (5 repeats)......."with all the other crap in your system (AD's, opiates, benzos) mate Lyrica is the least of your worries".

I'm actually using lyrica rarely nowadays, so when I do  take it I enjoy that kinda detached feeling I get from it.

I'm probably interrupting,but it's now 3 hours since first dose. I'm on 900 mg and I'm great. I still feel pain but I am numb and dissacociated .   Clonazepam , Temazepam or Percocet. I feel, if I took Percocet, I wouldn't feel it. I'm thinking Temazepam. Lyrica is a great medicine, that you can use at 600mg a day and IMO, easily taper off as quick as a week, but taper over a month would be all the time you need.

Longest lasting substance i've had @ 650mg absolutely mental, nearly 18 hours of a constant buzz, there's 2 stages to this the first feels like valium (300mg) the second (450+) is just wired for 18 hours, at least for me

Pregbalin around 300mg if you're combining after that it starts to just overthrow everything i throw at it, lower dose is better for combos n potentiation cause this isn't weak in any case it's quite a pronounced effect i doubt i would feel much else on a high dose of it except the lyrica, for me this in a higher dose has a very obvious long lasting buzz where as a lot of things are more subtle like benzos n light opiods

Hey all. a little update. So yesterday turned out great. I ended up taking a total of 1050mg of Lyrica/Pregabalin. If I could live like that I would. Chill as fuck and zoned out. Then I took 2mg of Clonazepam and 30mg of Temazepam dosed all separately. All I can say is wow. I am going to do less now, because I don't want to run out. I got up today and had a wonderful afterglow. I did a complete brake job on a Ford Explorer. I did take 300mg, when I woke up, but that kept me chill all day. Respect Pregabalin. It is great if it is used properly and respected. Tonight, I ate a gram at once, I forgot about staggering. The rest I eat will be staggered.

I've posted this in another thread, but maybe it's better here:


I am als new ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) I have agoraphobia and panic disorder. Also depression for more than 10 years now. After taking various antidepressants with horrible side effects,I am now stuck with Pregabalin 200mg, 2-3 times a week (I am rather satisfied, that I don't have to take this daily..). It works very well for anxiety and a little for depression. However, I have the feeling that it makes my teeth very sensitive. They also hurt on days I have to take them..sometimes like teeth hurt when having a cold/the flu. Did anyone else experience this and has an explanation? Maybe the gabapentin users, as I understand these two are very similar. Psychiatrist could not give an explanation and I am starting to worry about my teeth8)


Does anyone have an explanation why it could be damaging to teeth?

@Runtoparadise: No, it is not like that at all. My dreams are no more vivid than ever and the pain is there when I take them in the morning and the 2 following days (where I usually have a Pregabalin break). And its's not my jaw, really an toothpain and sometimes the gums hurt too. I have sore gums more often than usual. And teeth hurt when drinking something cold/hot (also not familiar to me..). My enamel also looks thinner (?). Don't really know, but I'm scared as I read something about loosing teeth in this thread yesterday..it was only mentioned that reports like this existed but Ithought maybe someone here noticed problems with teeth/gums

Slow_Mobius: No..sorry that isn't it. I have been to a dentist twice the last six months. First time for a check-up.. Everything was fine, no cavities he said. When they started getting sensitive I went again. He said that it was fine and then I mentioned that I am taking pharamaceutical drug against anxiety/depression. He only said that they produced a dry mouth and I should drink more. Maybe it's just me, but he did sound a little annoyed then![:|](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eyesclosed.gif). Anyway, I do not think it is the dry mouth problem. I have this a little on Pregabalin, but I drink water and practically chew gum all the time. My psychiatrist isn't even aware of alle the side effects it has, I researched it myself but I found no side effect regarding teeth and only recently stumbled over this thread, where it was mentioned two times I think.

I was able to finally get off GABA; although I do have seizures, which is why I was scripted, I pushed for it because it once made me feel "good". well, after taking 1600MG/day for a year, the "good" feeling obviously went away but was scared to kick the GABA due to seizures. I am on Keppra for the seizures, which is a must better drug for that; I just "worked" my Dr. to get scripted the GABA for obvious reasons. 


wondering if you guys think making the transfer to Lyrica is even worth it at this point? again, I am doing this just to get a good "feel" rather than to actually prevent seizures; if they happen to do both, great. but the Keppra, 4000MG/day, is more than enough for seizures. 


so has anyone STOPPED feeling GABAPENTIN and decided to move to Lyrica and actually get a warm/fuzzy feel out of it? unfortunately, this is the junkie in me talking. I am in the middle of going through Chemotherapy so I feel I can ask for anything at this point and probably get the script.

I have been having a weird mouth thing to, and I now believe it is the pregabalin. It feels like my gums are numbish and tingling at times. Towards the end of the day it feels like my entire mouth feels strange.

MocCozmik: My gumbs are not numbish but the tingling sensation is what I would describe. My teeth on the other hand feel like I have the flu or something..when I have the flu everything hurts (skin, teeth etc.). But my worries are more that it would somehow damage the enamel or cause cavities..Don't know if that is possible. Any dentists here![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)?

Boston, I have found Gabapentin (Neurontin) and Pregabalin (Lyrica) to be almost completely cross-tolerant and accordingly, very similar in effect(s). With that being said, I think that you would probably have a better experience with Pregabalin than with Gabapentin, but only if you give your tolerance significant time to reduce.

Yes, Keif' Richards is correct. Both gabapentin and pregabalin work the same way. But remember when you make the transition that pregabalin has different pharmacokinetics ie it gets rapidly and completely absorbed and it's incredibly potent compared to gabapentin but even with the doses you've been taking I'm convinced you'll still get a very noticeable effect from the pregabalin because 1600mg a day is not enough to dampen any effects from this drug. It is a HELL of a lot more potent. I really hope you get to try it. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I had nerve damage after a bad car accident and was given this medicine.  Had no prior knowledge of it beforehand and I'm pretty schooled on my pharmies.  I was on a high dose for like a month and I was messed up all the time.  It was fun at first but then it was just too much.  When I came off it after a month, the WD's were horrific!  Like the WD's from long term benzo use.  I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.  I've seen people on it hardcore and they're like zombies.

Agreed Wilson Wilson! My recreational dose for lyrica is 1400mg but my prescribed dose is 400mg daily, i save them up and go on a binge, I have shrinks appt on Thursday and I'm gonna ask for an increase to 600mg, along with codeine and fentanyl I find lyrica fantastic for my GAD. It's a lifesaver!

I read conflicting reports on this one,but general agreement seems to be that the effects are quite recreational,although tolerance develops very fast.

Are the effects more mdma like or more opiate like?or somewhere in between?

I was on a high dose for like a month and I was messed up all the time.  It was fun at first but then it was just too much.  When I came off it after a month, the WD's were horrific!  Like the WD's from long term benzo use.  I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.  I've seen people on it hardcore and they're like zombies.

Yes the withdrawals are terrible from this shit. A taper is necessary. Benzos to help with the insomnia and rebound anxiety too.

My recreational dose for lyrica is 1400mg but my prescribed dose is 400mg daily, i save them up and go on a binge, I have shrinks appt on Thursday and I'm gonna ask for an increase to 600mg, along with codeine and fentanyl I find lyrica fantastic for my GAD. It's a lifesaver!

1400mg is a massive dose! I use it so infrequently that even 150mg is enough for me to get fun out of it. I just have some piled up from an old script.


I have GAD too and it does help treat it without tolerance, but when I was on it daily it quickly became ineffective. I find benzos much more useful for anxiety. But pregabalin sure can be fun and it's very good at potentiating other drugs.

i took almost 3 grams of the stuff when i first got an RX to it. ate it all day, no tolerance at all. was tripping hard - closed eye visuals like fractals and flashes of lights, tracers & spinning fractal patterns and other OEV's, loss of coordination. it was very close to low dose LSD actually. obviously noone should eat grams of the shit, but i have more times than i can count, and i have one kidney, and i haven't noticed any negative effects aside from "the jolts" which only happen when i'm approaching the 2G mark.


unfortunately if i eat 2 grams now there is very little pleasure and only negative effects. it is the **best **medicine for opiate WD's though. a gram a day will keep the dope sick away. i always thought if i could obtain enough for a 7 day binge at that dose i could kick dope...

My first post:

Completely agree with the both of you. I've never had any problems with my gums or teeth until I was prescribed Lyrica 100mgs 2X daily. 

I really thought I was only one until I read theses posts and personally think that it will become an obvious side affect upon years to come.

I came off cold turkey.  It was awful.  But I was on 4 different meds at the time and I came off all of them at the same time!!  I was on Lyrica, Norco, Robaxin, and Klonopin.  Talk about hell on earth!!  Fortunately, after about 7 days of being VERY sick, my Dr prescribed me Klonopin again and that helped a lot with WD's.

If the doctor told you to that this was very very irresponsible. You should wean off each medication individually. Coming off all of them at once is bad enough, but doing it cold turkey is ridiculous.

So, yeah, I agree that benzo's saved me.  I was on the verge of having to go to the hospital from the terrible WD's.  I couldn't sleep, I couldn't eat (lost roughly 12 pounds in 7 days), I couldn't do anything.  I just laid in bed and went through the chills and sweats and being sick.  My whole body hurt from my muscles being so tight as I would stay totally tensed up.  I wouldn't wish what I went through on my worst enemy.  For real, don't mess around with this stuff!!  And if you do need to come off it, you should absolutely taper off and be under a Dr's supervision.  I know there are people that have to take it and I understand that.  But, please don't take this for fun!!  It's not worth it, IMO.  I've used a lot of pharmies for fun, especially when I was in college...but this stuff seems to be immediately addictive!  I know benzo's are highly addictive as well, but I could take those for a month straight and come right off them cold turkey with little or no WD's.  Of course, if you take a benzo for longer than that and stop cold turkey, I would liken the WD symptoms from that to those I went through with Lyrica.  I'll never take it again.  Even if I was in a situation where it needed to be medically given.  I think this is one of the most dangerous pharmaceuticals out there!!!  And, trust me, I've pretty much tried everything there is.

Using Lyrica for fun is fine as long as you know how to do it responsibly. Don't use it daily if you're not prescribed, keep your use to once or twice a week and you will never have a problem. Daily use causes diminishing returns on the recreational effects very quickly anyway.

Wilson Wilson, I agree that the Dr did s very irresponsible thing by pulling me off them all at once!  I was on the verge of seizures and I could've died.  Luckily, I pulled through and stayed off everything except the Klonopin once it was prescribed again.

I am just high enough to chime in on a mega thread devoted to a pretty damn good GABAergic. I can't afford Lyrica anymore but it used to be the anti anxiety med of my choice. Phenibut is an Ok substitute because I need such things to make my benzo Rx go farther. I fucking love Lyrica.


Did I read somewhere that it tickles your THC receptors?

No, his kpin helped. Though yes, his dr didn't have the knowledge to help him.


It's an all to familiar story, unfortunately, - benzos & opiates are now outdated.

lous76: Almost same here..I started in October 2015 and also noticed the issue in January. Have not been taking it for almost a week now. My teeth still feel pretty sensitive, but all in all a little better. Dentist told me some bs that meds don't affect the enamel of teeth.

Are you sure the teeth thing isn't from your gums? Because the gums can have pretty sensitive nerves and pregabalin numbs the response from them. It makes sense that you get rebound pain coming from coming off it.

I'm pretty sure. I know about the rebound thing, too. I have that with headaches. Have you ever had sensitive teeth, which react to cold/hot/sugary food or drinks? You can pretty much distinguish that from pain in your gums. My gums sometimes hurt as well because of inflammation. But, as said, that is a different kind of pain.

I ask because I often feel my teeth hurting the day after I use stims, for example, but I feel my jaw and I know it's because I was gurning too much. And when I use magnesium this stops. But at first I could have sworn it was my teeth, it very much felt like it was.


If it's sensitivity from certain foods perhaps it really is the teeth, I am just throwing out guesses.

Wilson Wilson: That's ok![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png). I certainly did a lot of thinking about this topic. I agree with the stims, but with lyrica the magnesium does not help. So I was one week without Lyrica and my teeth really got better regarding sensitivity. At day 5 they almost were not sensitive at all.Today I took it again and it was as always..teeth hurt and are super sensitive![:!](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/argh.gif). And I got a weird inflammation "spot" on one side of my cheek. Almost no euphoria today but as usual helped great with my anxiety..I really don't know how to proceed![:?](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/confused.gif). I don't want to take it for too long anymore..

Yes, I do. However, I have already asked my psychiatrist and he does not really know (he even had to look up the common side effects on his computer8)). My dentist said that medication in general does not affect teeth that much which I think is bs.. I don't have much luck with doctors here unfortunately.

Not surprised. I was told by a psychiatrist that pregabalin is non-addictive and he was happy to give me as much as I wanted, encouraging me to up my dose every time I visited him. But he was very cautious with benzos, telling me how addictive they are. Ironically I found that I developed dependence to pregabalin much faster than any benzo, even the weird RCs. It really takes even psychiatrists a while to catch up with what all these new drugs are actually like.

Sorry to hear that![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png). At least my psychiatrist warned me about the addictiveness so I ended up taking them only 2-3 times a week. But of course I would never ever get a restricted amount of benzos prescribed because they are the evil8) (don't get me wrong, I know they are addictive, I once almost fell into that trap but had I not been that cautious with lyrica, it would be exactly the same..).

This is the thing man, I did my own research so knew it was addictive and I said no when my psychiatrist kept trying to up my dose. Still I had withdrawals after only being on pregabalin for a month.


Never had withdrawal from benzos because I keep them strictly PRN, never daily use. But from what you said it sounds like Germany is the same as the UK: the doctors are all on about how benzos are evil. How can they hand out pregabalin without restriction but talk shit about benzos? I would go as far as to say pregabalin is WORSE than benzos for dependence.


Such a shame because I know for a fact clonazepam treats my anxiety better than any other medication I have tried including other benzos. But I also know I will never get a script for clonazepam because the system hates it. I am forced to use the black market to obtain effective medication for my diagnosed medical condition. Shit's fucked up mate.

Talk about hell on earth!!  Fortunately, after about 7 days of being VERY sick, my Dr prescribed me Klonopin again and that helped a lot with WD's.

I can't even imagine the hell that would be. I was off temazepam a year before I decided to come off lyrica and that  sucked even with a taper.

I wish I could get my hands on some of this BS so I could see if its worth me STILL pushing my Dr. to change my script from GABA to Lyrica, lol. yes, I've been asking too much and its starting to be noticeable the junkie in me is coming out. I am also starting to use dope more and more often again, so the Lyrica at this point would be pointless. I need to smarten up w/ life and get back on the "right" track.

Is Pregabalin harder to withdraw from than benzos?  Reason I ask, my Dr has prescribed me Pregabalin and stopped my Klonopin scripts as he said I wont need Klonopin now that he has prescribed my Pregabalin?

For the first 28 years of my life I had amazing teeth. No cavities. And immaculate oral hygine routine that I follow to this day. Age 28, I am prescribed lyrica and aged 29, I get one cavity and my first filling. Now I'm going back for my second. I don't suffer from dry mouth. I don't have a diet high in sugar; I even limit fruit.

EP158207: I believe you. I Have a similar issue as mentioned above. Only I still don't seem to have a "real" cavity according to dentist. However, my enamel looks not so great..I used to have very healthy looking almost white teeth. Now they are slightly yellow and thin. Well, I got my last prescription today and think I will finish using them until July. My doctor finally gave me 4 Tavor, as I have very bad anxiety due to a stressfull next week and traveling by plane..Have to see how they work but I won't get them regularly.

Ruined- I disagree too. Now not only do my teeth had weird tingling, my roof of my mouth kinda has a burning sensation. I can't describe it. It's weird. Going to stop the lyrica for a little bit

Was prescribed Lyrica 200mg 3x a day for foot neuropathy pain. Worked great for pain relief but had terrible side effects at that high of dose. Weight gain, shortness of breath, constant fatigue. Made the huge mistake of stopping cold turkey after a month. Terrible withdrawal lasted like 3 weeks. Resumed taking it at 200mg 1x a day and still worked great on the pain at that lower dosage. I have now found to avoid building tolerance, which does happen quickly, that I can take it every other day and still works great. Also as many have stated it works great on anxiety as well as neuropathic pain.

My only concern is with effects of long term use. There are no study's done yet as far as i know.

Lyrica was the second worst pharmaceutical experience, even taken with hydromorphone! At least I didn't throw up from it, took 1 pill. I'd rather have phenobarbital or oxazepam. 


The worst pharmaceutical experience of all time has to go out to Baclofen which like clockwork made me throw up each and every single morning after, even from 1 pill (10mg) and this was experienced by 2 other friends that took it in varying doses. Throwing up was just part of it but I felt like shit for about 1-2hrs in the mornings.

This may be a wierd question but am I the only one having increased visual hallucination while taking Lyrica and having a HPPD? 

Also yesterday I took 2.150g of lyrica and had those fractions of seconds where I had a complete picture taking over my vision and a complete sensorial blackout beside that image. Only lasted fraction of second and I did not felt anything like it or even any side effect at all when I took 1.650g a week or so ago. I don't think I will get that High of a dose again because of this effect well at least not without the confirmed certitude that the effect is NOT due to lyrica. Am I the only one who has experianced this at HIGH doses?

Actually is I just developped quite a tolerance, that plus the fact that the first time I took it I took 600mg one shot and barely felt comfortable. Ihave a script. I only use my doses 1/5 days which makes accumulation of 450mg/day * 5 days = 2150mg/5days

Never really blacked out in fact I had more energy than usual, the only thing I was talking about felt more like a BP dropout that blinds you to every senses.


I agree that the dose was too high but taking in count how I react to the drug normally and the low tolerance  installed Mabe not by that much.

^^^sorry, but that's a fucking waste. We all took higher then prescribed doses, but your doses are like worthless. Spend a month or two and lower that stuff to a normal level, You can feel massive pain relief at 600mg. It's all in your head. I was blacking out and falling acsleep at s saggeref 600mg.. IMO, there really is no reason to go over a gram or 1200 mg at most. IMO, if you take your time and stagger your doses from the lowest amount to say 200mg - 300mg at most every 45min to an hour, straight up, you will fell great. I'm different then every one else, but we tend to agree on this dosing method. Bottom line, your dose is too much pieroid.

Hi everyone. I'm on Pregabalin for nerve damage/pain and it is the only effective drug I've tried. A tolerance does build up quickly so I need to have a few days off it when I can. i can't say i get much of a buzz or high off it, even at 700mg or higher. If anything it feels a bit unpleasant, aside from the fact the pain is gone. Affects everyone differently, clearly.

Speed King, 

                First, not a waste, since I felt something while I cant at lower dose even the FIRST TIME i touched Lyrica. Then, how can a 2-3 month use 1/5 days require a 2 month pause to lower tolerance while it takes mostly 5-7 days (mabe more but not alot) for MOST people (reports I have read on BL and other drugs forum)?


 Mabe you can feel massive pain relief at 600mg, but I do not and that even the FIRST TIME. Mabe you were blacking out at 600 but I feel more energized even at doses up to 1.5g.


 And the slow dose increase of one dose every 45min is to combat bioavability problem linked to GABAPENTIN not PREGABALIN, in fact pregabalin was created to do skip that exact problem.


 Mabe you are different than everyone else but I think we all are and I also think that one of the things that makes me different is the amount of general sedatives I can take without feeling the effect of a normal dose of the drug even when its the FIRST time I try this specific drug. 


Bottomline I wasnt really posting to get opinions of people on my personnal drug use but rather on the visual enhancing effect of Lyrica to HPPD but I think that kinda went under. I think it is most attracting to general people to criticize others than to answer direct questions and you provided me with a proof of that, well at least that you think like that.

Regarding a link between Pregabailin and tooth loss - well i just lost four teeth in the last month. I did a search after reading the possible link and found this. I'm coming off them NOW, but the damage may be irreversible. And no idea what I will do about the nerve pain.

Marcid, first, I apologize if I came across all judgemental. That wasn't my goal. I merely shared my view. I have been on Lyrica for years at various doses and recently been bumped up to a daily total of 450mg /day. That gives me room to experament. I have found that for me 600mg is the sweet spot. I have dosed up to 2g and got no special effect. Now 1g gave me a ketamine effect, but for pratical pirpossss 600mg is it. 

Again, I have to research  your condition. We are all different. So, no hard feelings.  Speed King

Hey SK hows things? R u high atm? Lol ur spelling ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


Mightyoak, yes, they're the usual effects when starting lyrica, hence some ppl feel they can't tolerate it & cease usage.


Give it some time and tolerance will kick in as your body adjusts you'll barely notice any difference.


If it is interfering with your work, ability to drive etc try taking it late in the day or even at bedtime.


Although I take it for Nerve pain, it's also a good anxiolytic for me in higher doses & improves my mood too.


What type of  clonaze dose were you taking?

Hello RTP, no I'm not high. Working on it ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png). Really though,?just trying to contribute. Quick comment . The Lyrica I'm taking in pain management (150mg X 3 per day)!is putting a dent in my pain level. I have three bulging disks in my lower back . The doctor said there is nothing to do but get shots and stay on pain medicine .

I've been taking Lyrica for about 8 years now. Needless to say, I've been on the highest recommended daily dose for years now (300 mg 2x daily). I absolutely LOVE my Lyrica. It works well for the pain and if you're having a shitty day, you can always pop a couple extra and sleep all day, lol. However, I've been taking Oxy (in different forms) along side the Lyrica for years as well. However, I just switched pain docs and the new one took me off the Oxy and put me on 100mg Nucynta ER. This is only day 3 or so, but so far I'm not impressed. I would normally take one of my 300mg Lyrica and 2 10mg Percs and be good for hours. Anyone have anymore info on this Nucynta crap and how I might be able to get the same feel from it as I did with the Oxy? Any help is greatly appreciated.

Dear Migi, I am BURNING today as I needed to be clear minded and didn't my any doses of Gabapentin until early evening. I've done a lot of research on nerve pain and it seems that Opiods have little effect on this kind of pain. I'm going to ask a pain dr about Nucynta. It's the only pain drug I've read about that seems to help with flares. I have an orphan disease called Erythromelalgia where the palms of my hands turn bright red and feel as though scalding water has been poured into them. You sounded rather frantic in your message and I hope this info will be of help. Oh my goodness. Just reread your post and it was 6 yrs ago. Damn

Hey SK sorry if I reacted a little defensive. I just gained this reflex from my judgemental family. I think I have a specific genetic contiditon that makes me a little more ''speedy'' which makes me less sensible to sedative drugs.


High doses of Lyrica feel better than opiates to me, its like the first body high from weed all over again. It is the only thing I have access to relieve my headache and other chronic pain. I guess it is not ideal but I gotta do with it.


I am glad this medication works for some people suffering from chronic pain since it is a horrible illness.

SK,- why don't you post over on the pain megathread? 


So you're still at that stage of wanting an increase, did you never get one? IMHO all drs are attempting to reduce or wean the opiate doseages of Cpp's. Scare tactics I assume.


The above posters re: Nucynta or Tapentadol, firstly, Matt2tatt, that's a really low dose to what you're accustomed to.


As I've posted in other threads for the handful of posters who've been scripted it, 100mg Tapentadol = 10mg oxycodone/Contin.


You really can't catch a buzz with this med, even if u crushed it up to make it IR. Nor can u take too much of it at once as the nasty noradrenalin takes over & makes you feel horrible. It often referred to as "tramadols big brother", kinda like the difference between lyrica & Gabapentin.


777prp, Tapentadol can be helpful for neuropathic pain, if you don't have a high opiate tolerance. 


I met an older woman at hydrotherapy who couldn't praise it highly enough & didn't stop talking about how much better her type of pain was since she'd commenced this med. 


If what you are taking now is not working effectively then go ahead and ask your doctor, 


Best of luck, 


Rtp

Pfizer got taken to court for not disclosing the nasty withdrawals that can happen, when they tested it.

they kept it quiet, then made lyrica, gabap's big brother, which I am hooked on.

Im tapering off though. 

If I was hooked on gabapentin I would cross over to pregabalin, as pregabalin is water soluble, and is much easier to taper, because you can just put mg for ml in water, and take out your cut with a syringe which can be easily bougth or obtained anywhwere.

Although an intoxication does occur the moodlift with lyrica is much stronger than benzos and on parr with opioids. You don't have to enjoy benzodiazepines(i find them boring unless potentiating opioids) to enjoy lyrica. The biggest problem with lyrica is tolerance, after 1 day i'll need up to 2 grams to get anywhere, maybe i've a natural tolerance though. Imo the guideline dosages are a fucking joke, 2 75mg caps a day lmao, in the states some get 1 50mg cap. Not even perceivable AT ALL at these doses. For those noobies curious to try, don't bother with anything less than 300mg, i think the majority will probably need more.

I think benzos are boring, thats why I got hooked on the sleepers. Benzos relax you, but you don;t alwys wanna be monged out.

I have a dual addidtion to gabaA and to pregab, but I am getting there, as in, tapering off pregab and movoing from sleepers to valium, in prep for detox off val, it's staying off drugs thats my problem, I just hate sobriety.

> — Jenco said:

i think gabapent and lyrica are cross tolerant. Lyrica high is very short lived as in it last a while but tolerance means you never hardly get high, and the withdrawals are horrible.


Benzos don't do anything to alleviate lyria withdrawals. Z drugs are also useless for alleviating lyrica withdrawals.


PS, if anyone wants a pain free way of successfully tapering lyrica, give me a shout. I was addicted to 600mg a day, and have painlessley come down to 330mg a day in 3 short months. 

I found a way to do it by experimentation. Before my tapering experiments, I tried the  conventional way of tapering, by cutting my lyrica and I just felt like how shit itslef might feel if it was having a bad day.

I used to also take all my lyrica at once for the high, but once the withdrawals came, I found that a day was too long to wait, and my brain needed evening out a bit where the lyrica intake was concerned.


I split my 600mg a day dose into four and I dissolve it in water mg for ml, and, using a syringe, I take out a little bit from each 6hrly dose and I found the lyrica withdrawal symptoms faded.

Splitting the dose meant my brain was getting lyrica every 6hrs as the previous dose wore off, and things seemed to balance out more. The sweats went, and the IBS subsided a bit and the headaches totally fucked off somwehre thank god.

The only time I get any bother from my lyrica withdrawals is if I forget a dose, so, I set my alarm on my phone to go off every six hours. I also gathered together four small airtight jars to carry my liquiefied lyrica.

I use a much cheaper generic lyrica, and although it is pregabalin, it is not called lyrica as Prizer own that name and are the only ones who can charge so much. My doc wont prescribe it due to my abuse history of drugs, thank god I dont have to pay the full price of lyrica, and thank god it is water soluble so I can accurately measure my small daily micro cuts which enabled most of the horrible symptoms to go away.

To me, pregab doesn't help benzo withdrawals.

You need to come off clonpin slowly, it can be nasty but I know a painless way to get off it, give me a pm if you want to know any more.

I got off valium painlessley, a lady showed me how to taper in a way that involved tiny daily cuts but was quicker than a stepped taper.

Doctors can be terrible for pulling off patients off benzos far too quickly, and I dont mean to scare you but rapid withdrawal can cause seizures and in extreme cases life threatening.

You need to be in control yourself of your own taper, not your doctor.

Benzobuddies, have formed a list of benzo-wise doctors who know how to safely take patients off benzos so its worth visiting that site.

I'm from the UK but there are loads of US and other countries members on BB

The consensus among doctors seems to be 50/50 with this issue. I simply want to know if any Bluelighters have gotten relief combining them together in the range I mentioned earlier. If so what were the dosages?

I've only ever done pregab.

nasty withdrawals, im tapering down from 600 and now on 324mg, holding for a bit cos i got addicted to zopiclone also and I am in the last week of a one month crossover to valium ready to do a taper off.

I dont take drugs to get high, i just take them so that i can get through the day without breaking down or falling apart.

Thanks for your assist 3dmusic.

Yes I'm aware of the risks of the withdrawal these gaba drugs present, but for me the benefits will out weigh the potential risk for short term use. I also don't want to max out the dosages, its common sense that the taper will be softer this way. 


What I'm really getting at here is a choice of moderate therapeutic doses of both or a higher dose of the superior drug to get me over the hump. 


I'm still interested hearing what my other peers have to say.

I've been trying to locate an online pharmacy for Gabapentin or Lyrica as I do not have insurance since losing my job. So no script but need to continue meds. Everywhere looks like a scam. I'm not looking for Oxys or anything like that. Just don't know where to turn. I've always taken my dose of 150x3 day and never had any issues just don't know where I can order online and not get scammed. Any help is appreciated.

Did anyone notice that there are more side effects with betapharma Pregabalin than with other brands (I had ratiopharm first and noticed that somehow they worked better for me). 


Oh, and again regarding teeth..I got mine checked out at the dentist today. Had 2 cavities, which does not seem much..however ..I have never had any in my life! He asked me, if I bite my teeth a lot because there was some erosion. Also I had a lot of tartar, which he said could maybe be caused by the lyrica. But tartar is not as big a problem. I have changed the dentist since the last time I wrote here, but I am still insecure about this. Nobody seems to know anything, except from a few horror stories that someone here posted as a link a short time ago.

Not for me, although I can only remember using it during period of withdrawal. So I don't know.

Pregabalin seems to possibly cause tooth decay. This of course has not been proven scientifically or medically. These are just other people's experiences that I came across online. Since my teeth have been bothering me since on lyrica as well

Glad to be back RTP. Just had a spinal epidural done with a steroid. Big fun. I have three bulging disks in lower back. It explains lower back, hip, and both legs pain. Going to physicial therapy. That helps a lot. I want to stretch my Percocet out, that's why I was interested in Lyrica. Hope you are well. Everyone have a wonderful day.

I have a tolerance, yet 600mg is a magic number. Sometimes, I think we expect Lyrica/pregabalin to kick in faster than it does. I've dosed 1gram and felt like I was on K and I have dosed 1500mg + and nothing. I think we need to give it a little more time to kick in. Different subject, are we supposed to stagger Lyrica or can it be dosed in one go? I'm used to staggering, espically for benzodiazepine potentiation. Comments, suggestions?

I know there's been much conversation on Gabapentin not so much lyrica though. I stagger it to avoid blackouts. I am kinda sensitive to it, depending on how often I'm taking it.


Usually I'd give it an hr & a 1/2 then redose in such a pattern through the day.

I'll try that RTP. I'm just trying to get the most out of it. No sense wasting any. I do know that it potentiates benzodiazepines. Lately not so much. I think I'm going to stagger and try it out. I ate 900mg in one go before and it did nothing much. I felt it, but not strong.

I take 1.5g every 3 days and experiance no withdrawl and have a full day of pleasure. I guess my sober is abnormal (I have anxiety, muslce tenison/spasms, racing thoughts about anything that comes to my mind). Mabe all those symptoms hide the possible withdrawl. Lyrica is fun and I hope to find another drug like this one to cycle it with. Then I would have 2 days of pleasure and 1 day of hell every 3 days. It  would be better than now.

^That is similar to how I take it, unless my leg pains are playing up.


Every few days when I don't need to be anywhere important or drive I take my lyrica. Starting early then adding every 90mins or so.


I find I actually get more done around the house & hv more motivation.

Just thought about that, I read that Lyrica can reduce libido and cause erectile dysfunction but I get the exact OPPOSITE. I get super high libido and no problem with the machinery. Am I the only one having the opposite side effect that they predicted? It is kind of wierd, every time I take that med I think 2 to 3 times more about sex ! Not really distasteful but still uncommon !

I love lyrica. I DONT love how I power through my script. 


I generally dose 5 225mg capsules day one.... 7-8 of them day two.... then wait 2 days... a week if I can manage. 


But generally they're gone mid month. I like the way they make my body feel electric. And my mind gets a bit loopy. Im more sociable and at ease in groups. Balance slightly off.


Its way more effective for me than gabapentin.


Edit: I can't believe I didnt mention that I puked off my lyrica a cpl days ago. That's never happened to me before. Off like btwn 6-![8o](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eek.gif)f my 225mg capsules. I dont remember at which point in my dosing that happened. I kept getting that feeling in my stomach like the one you get on a rollercoaster as it plummets. Too much on not the right foods i guess, and lets just say I wouldnt have eaten the way I did had I known I would puke. 


(Was also very stoned)

:DSigned up to Bluelight to let you wonderful people know I just dropped my first dose of 600mg Lyrica. I'll update you in the morning to let you know how it goes.


EDIT

I downed 800mg in the end and had a bit of euphoria. Nothing too special for me though. Dizzy as hell and couldn't walk properly, but that was expected. Ended up falling asleep after 4 hours, woke up with the euphoria still going and still dizzy as hell! 6/10 for me. I wouldn't go out of my way to get hold of them, but that's just me

So, I've been Lyrica free for two weeks and really noticed an improvement. Tooth sensitivity was gone by day 5. Teeth seemed stronger and better looking alltogether. Tried a paste with recaldent (google it...useful stuff in my opinion). Then after the two weeks I thought "ok, let's give it another shot". I' m not sure why, but euphoria was almost non-existent and I got tired after 6 hours (before I was productive all day and tired after 10+ hours). The next day i felt like shit..depression, crying over nothing, nausea, headache. And of course my teeth hurt again. So I'm thinking that slowly but surely the negative side effects outhweigh the positive gains I had in the beginning. My next break will last at least 3 weeks and then really only in emergency cases. However, in these cases I'm thinking I'd now maybe rather take benzos. I mean if I cannot take the Lyrica even every two weeks now...where's the point? Benzos seem safer (if taken this rarely) and for me they are not euphoric enough to get addicted. Even with the Lyrica I was extremely careful and 3 times a week was the maximum I would take (as also adviced by my psychiatrist). Take care guys and watch out for your teeth and general health of course![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

I take Lyrica for foot neuropathy in my feet. It is the only thing that touches the extreme nerve pain I have. I don't take any more than 200mg a day and I try to take at least 2 days off a week. I was taking 600mg a day but the side effects were overwhelming. Weight gain, shortness of breath, drowsiness. I tried stopping cold turkey and that was a huge mistake. The withdrawals were awful and lasted almost 3 weeks.

Does anybody know what receptor is responsible for the recreational effects of pregabalin?


"Binding to α2δ-1 appears to contribute to analgesic effects ([10](http://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/37/12/3253.long#ref-10),[11](http://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/37/12/3253.long#ref-11)), whereas binding to α2δ-2 appears to contribute to CNS side effects ([10](http://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/37/12/3253.long#ref-10),[12](http://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/37/12/3253.long#ref-12))."

[http://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/37/12/3253.long#ref-10](http://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/37/12/3253.long#ref-10)


Is the α2δ-2 receptor the target that gives CNS depression and euphoria?

My Father was put on 100mg a day after his wife died just over three years ago,the doctor told him that it would help with the grieving. My father has now put on much weight,his legs have blown up with fluid and look like elephant legs,he is also having problems with his teeth and nails,one of his teeth crumbled which had an old amalgam filling in which he had to have filled again,he then had a front tooth fall out and now has had to have a bridge put in.


My Father used to have good nails too,strong and helthy and were quite hard to cut,now they are weak and flaking,they go into layers and break away easily. Hearing all these horror reports on a possible link to tooth decay by using pregabalin (Lyrica) I believe this to be true.


I read in the leaflet that comes with this med that it is a (CALCIUM CHANNEL BLOCKER) meaning that it helps with blood pressure by reducing the amount of calcium that travels through the blood vessels,the calcium causing like a build up a bit like limescale in pipes,and widening the blood vessels to lower blood pressure. My Father is already on blood pressure pills called Amlodipine,so in effect these two drugs combined are having a greater effect on blocking calcium,its therefore my conclusion that these drugs deplete calcium in the body and effect teeth and nails.


It would be good to know how many people that take pregabalin are on blood pressure meds.

Im on lyrica and clonidine (an older blood pressure med), even though my bp is generally on the low side.


It helps my pain meds wrk better &  (touch wood) I've had no teeth issues.


Maybe it's from clenching teeth at night time, I know I wake with a sore jaw some days, though I think that's more opiate related.

This is shocking. Lyrica is contraindicated in people with depression. Since it can worsen depression, it sounds like the last thing that someone should take to help with grieving

^It is shocking! Sorry, I think I only skimmed through this post earlier. I have heard of lyrica being used for GAD, but not depression.


I hope he's no longer taking it as he is obviously hvng side effects, & if I were you or your father I'd be getting in touch with the folks at Pfizer & making an official complaint. 


It's only recently I've heard of dental issues associated with lyrica & I thought it must be due to something else as well. 


Having to have a front tooth implanted is no joke & recently cost my mother almost au$10,000. (Nothing to do with meds).


There may well be a class action going on against Pfizer regarding dental issues that we are unaware of.


It's important they know about this (preferably from a solicitors letter if that's an option), they may offer a full or partial solution if they've received other complaints of dental issues.


Pregabalin is a huge money spinner for Pfizer & if there's not already a class action suit going forward, it'd be a huge blow for them if say, you went to the media instead. (Just saying ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

Yes his Doctor described the dizzy spells and the stars he was seeing,as well as stiff neck and shoulders was to do with anxiety brought on by the death of his wife and that pregabalin would help in this situation.


My father has been on these pills for the last three years.

^ Lyrica can be a decent anxiolytic for some, especially social anxiety. But when it comes to death & the varying stages of grieving surely a dr could write a decent benzo script!


Has your father told the prescribing dr what you've told us? Has he asked for blood tests & for any other disease process to be ruled out?


It's only been in the last few mths iirc that anythings been posted re:dental issues. However, it is a relatively new drug & not all the facts or side effects are known.


I hope all of you with dental issues get your dr to "red card" Pfizer so they're officially informed, there may be many, many others not linking that lyrica is the cause of tooth probs.(or too few voices being heard for it to be officially looked into).

Pregabaline *may* sometimes cause euphoria but this depends on the situation. When I got coincidentally depressed while I was on pregabaline I got extra depressed.

Hi [MENTION=390361]Slow_Mobius[/MENTION]

I didn't know lyrica can worsen depression. I was taking it recreationally and started tapering around xmas time, i was on 600mg a day, now on 284mg

I spray magnesium oil on my body twice a day, bowels dont like me taking it orally, but transdermally magnesium helps balance calcium and actually makes calcium work better. Dunno how, sorry.

Ive read a lot about magnesium helping with pregab withdrawals.

I dose 5 times a day, as its short acting, and reduce by a 2mg, it used to be 3mg, before that 4mg and started with 5mg a day reductions cos I wasnt on the bigger doses very long.

I noticed a reduction in withdrawal symptoms once I started my taper, having said that, some of those 'withdrawals' could have been lyrica side effects. I'm hoping not to have to reduce my cut anymore and be off it come the end of the year or sooner.

Lyrica was a weird med for me. I don't know if it causes depression so much as it makes depression worse. When I went off,  (I was only taking 150mg) the WDs I experienced were kind of like the unwanted side effects (lethargy, emotional flatnesses) were amplified plus anxiety. Tapering at that dose was pretty useless for me. I just stopped one day by taking 1mg klonopin instead and was through the worst of it without a problem.

50 mg once a day was a miraculous pain med for about a month. The analgesic effect was nonexistent after that time, and increasing the dose gave me more of the side effects and didn't really give me back any of the analgesia

The highest daily dose a GP is allowed to prescribe is 600mgs split into a morning and evening doses of 300mgs.


Every chronic pain patient in Australia is probably on this dose it's become so normalized

Took my usual 800mg dose of lyrica with 100mg of vyvanse after staying up all night hallucinating from an (over) dose of glaucine extract (400mg plus pure powder). Went toward and when I got there realized I was HIGH. I mean, fucking ripped, twitching and stuttering as usual. I thought,"this is AWESOME since I can just put on my headphones and stare at the wildly swirling bright computer screen. Then I got up to get some chips....made it out into the hall before twitching and fucking falling over. This kept happening- I mean it was uncontrollable- like mini seizures that would drop me to the floor like a sack of wet flour. I thank god made it back to my desk without falling over IFO everyone and stayed there in my seat till the end of my shift. I usually take 800mg as a "recreational" dose with no issues sans twitching and stuttering lol. Usually, at that dose, I get some visuals, increased sociability, feel mildly euphoric (best goddamn potentiation of full mu agonists EVER btw), but this only lasts for one dose- if I re-dose the next day I just feel a dull body high. I had re-dosed, so I didn't expect much, but what I got- omg. I think the the calcium channel inhibition MOA associated with both glassine and lyrica allowed me to re-experience the same- no, an even higher, high- I mean I was uncomfortably, like,"shit, I'm going to lose my job," high. Never had the mini black out experience before. If you are taking any nootropics or drugs with a calcium channel blocking effect, use with caution lol. Only other drugs in my system were buprenorphine 8mg (I know-too much and am working on cutting down) and nortryptaline.

My doc started me at 25 mg 3x a day for nerve pain. Just increased one doseage to 50mg and it makes me feel drunk. Had to stop gabapentin because I felt drunk on only 200mg doseage. Tried Nucynta, didn't touch the pain. ARGH!

tolerance, its the worst drug for tolerance, at 600mg, I said, right, that's it, and started tapering, and here I am now at 268mg

I think it is causing daytime anxiety, cos i am addicted to benzos as well, but while they work if I ake them on a night, they dont work during thte day.

I took 900mg of lyrica last week. I started twitching and having compulsions(?), or some sort of seizure(?) then I stopped breathing and blacked out and my face went purple and my friend checked my pulse and I didn't have one for a while. I was out for a few minutes he said, until I came around. Then I went to hopsital and got my bloods checked and stuff. They haven't got back to me yet. There have been 6 deaths because of lyrica in my city; Belfast... recently. I was nearly one of them. I would like to say, it was my prescribed medicine and not something I got of the streets.


Maybe some the capsules are being dosed wrong?

600mg per day is the recommended max dosage although people  routinely take over that. I've heard of some people having a seizure at doses above 1000mg although I don't think it's common.   I've had the twitching before at 400mg+ even with a daily tolerance. Do you take any other meds?

I think it would help a lot. Im pretty sure any withdrawal from Lyrica would be GABAergic and since phenibut is a gaba-mimetic it should at least greatly reduce the withdrawal. Be careful with the phenibut though. that stuff has a nasty withdrawal itself.

@Snake_Eyes


how was your taper, and did you suffer any symptoms after getting off completely.

If you did suffer symptoms after getting off completely, how long did they last and what were they?

It would help me as i am doing a taper

What would you say is a safe frequency of dosage, around the 350mg mark, in order to avoid dependency? i.e. how many times can you take a 350mg dose a week to avoid long-term addiction...2x, 1x, less than 1x a week?


Thank you, much appreciated.

^ Imho few times a month max until it loses effects and twice in a week to not develop physical dependency. Psychological varies more.

At first I tried to come off too quickly which caused a lot of physical pain in my arms, legs and back, once I started making smaller cuts it wasn't as bad but still there. I tapered all the way down to 12.5mg  before jumping off and by then most (if not all) of the physical pain was gone. I can't really comment on any mental problems that it caused (if any) because I was/am  a daily poly drug user and I also came off daily benzos a year prior, so my mental heath is probably not the most stable anyway. 


I would suggest treat it similar to coming off benzos and take it slow. I didn't have a preset cut schedule that I followed I just went by how I felt, sometimes I would hold at a dose for a week,  other times I would hold  for a month. Just listen to your body and make your cuts to keep you as comfortable as possible.  Goodluck.

Thanks. I have been taking it between 100-350mg a day for the last two months. Mostly just 100mg a day, the larger doses have only been on days I've been working, which is only two or three days a week. Lately I've been feeling really shitty on the days I'm only taking 100mg. Really achy all over, and tired, and anxious. I can only conclude this is rebound anxiety, i.e. mild WD.


I think I'm going to come off it. I take it for anxiety but if I was to take say 350mg every day, I think it would give me complete sexual dysfunction and loss of libido, as I've felt those effects somewhat even with my current regimen. Going to try and taper off, and find an alternate solution for my anxiety. In the meantime I'll use diazepam but need to be careful not to get fucking dependent on that as well.

How much stronger is lyrica than pregabalin - could you reach the same effect from  high dose pregabalin, or is lyrica's make-up different so that it is more recreational?

I take alot of lyrica and nerontin it's a very happy feeling like you're just indifferent to things that normally would give you anxiety or bother you. You do have coordination problems alot like being tipsy on alcohol. For me the effects kick in in about an hour or hour and a half and can last almost 24 hrs. I have a high tolerance so I take more every couple hours. I've taken 9600 mgs and was totally fine but if you haven't taken them before I'd start out at 1000. This of course is just my opinion. You build a tolerance real quick so you have to at least double your dose and maybe even a little more to keep getting the same high.  I quit after day three and try to wait at least a week before taking more.  As with any drug the longer you wait before taking any the better the high next time.  I was originally prescribed these to get off benzos.  Obviously it worked  and it doesn't show up on any panel drug test.  I've also heard it works good for helping take the edge of when your done sick. The only side effect I get is my hands and feet swell up. It's worse on lyricas than with nerontin.  Some people say lyrica is just a strong nerontin but that's false. They do have very similar compounds but nerontin has more of a hallucination effect. I've never heard of any one having withdrawals from either drug..i take alot and I don't but would like to hear if anyone has.  I definitely recommend trying this especially if your on probation and are feeling squirmy from not being able to smoke weed ect...

That's how I got addicted. The gaps got narrower, cos I couldnt stand the day being pissed off/upset, etc, as I have BPD and its so painful to live with, every emotion is magnified adn it feels unbearable, and you get anxious too, well, I do.

I'm on my day 5 clean of Suboxone after 7 months with this, after 4 years of addiction to opiates. I know pretty well Lyrica as Neurontin because I took them a few times in the past for GAD (Neurontin only in one treatment), and when I quit opiates and started with Suboxone, the dr prescribed me 300mg pregabalin/day, but a few months ago I started to reduce the dose gradually for the side effects like dizziness, confusion, lethargy.. (I guess the side effects were too from bupe).

In my experience pregabalin is a wonderful Aid in suboxone withdrawal. Especially if you don't have tolerance, slowly build up the effective dose as tolerance grows. 


I recently had a situation in which I was without pregabalin for a period of 5 days (450mg a day) I don't exactly know where it went off to but either a friend took 5 days worth of it or the pharmacy shorted me which I am not ruling out because it was not a sealed bottle when I received it.


Serendipitously my father had just stopped taking Gabapentin and I was able to grab the rest of his 1200mg a day dose. He happens to have exactly five days supply. It worked well enough that I wasn't in horrible withdrawal, but I was very tired much of the time and occasionally felt feverish and just overall a bit crummy.

Thanks for your answer, maybe I will reconsider up my dose of pregabalin to 75mg. In what aspects you say that it's a wonderful aid? In the mood, the body fatigue, the insomnia... I would prefer don't increase the dose of pregabalin, cause I know that the withdrawal of this sucks too (obviously no comparation with Suboxone or any opiate), but if this could help me remarkably in the next few months with the PAWS, I think worth it then.

I'm prescribed 300mg lyrica twice a day for pain in my spine caused by mild kyphosis. Needless to say, because of the quick building tolerance, and addictive personality, I run out very quickly. I make sure I have at least 100mg a day until the next refill to avoid really bad withdrawal but my point is that after using only tiny amounts a few weeks the tolerance remains. When I got my refill I took about 3g and didn't notice much of a high.

Has anyone noticed the horrible constipation this stuff causes?

One more thing, it's a miracle drug for amphetamine come downs.

After I stopped taking up to 150 mg of lyrica daily for a couple months, I had muscle twitches (mostly in my legs) constantly for weeks after I stopped. Its really not a big deal since its finally gone, but it seems strange that it lasted so long after any other WD symptom was present. I'm certain it was from the lyrica WD because it was always one of the first things I noticed if I missed a dose. 


Anyone else experience this weird effect?

Yep good old Lyrica. In my opinion a very fun recreational drug. For me I usually take 700mg of it. 1 hour in and I start feeling the effects of relaxing euphoria accompanied by pleasent body sensations, a drunk feeling, XTC and valium all combined. But tolerance is a bitch so after good night on Lyrica I stay away from it for a good month. 


Plus this stuff last for AGES. Ide say at least 12 hours with a nice afterglow the following day if taken in the late afternoon.


10/10 for this prescription

Depending on ROA. If it was me I would take your dose of lyrica first and then wait for effects to roll on through and then take your opiate of choice. Lyrica last WAY longer than any opiate out there

Lyrica takes about 2 hours before I feel it. So depending on what my  goals are for the night I would take the opiate an hour and a half after the lyrica so they both come on at the same time. With tramadol  I would take them at the same time since they both take about the same to hit (minus the snri effect) with kratom it depends on my mood, sometimes at the same time since kratom is so short lasting I use the lyrica  to take over once the kratom "buzz" fades.


With benzos  (temazepam specifically) 2 hours before, it  makes them  hit pretty damn hard, same with alcohol (light drinking only).

Lyrica can take up to two hours to kick in. And you definitely want the lyrica to be working before you take the opiate. Otherwise you'll waste your opiate and then your lyrica will kick in

thanks for the responses. I just go my refill of 90, 150mg pills. I'm probably at 1350mg over the last 10 hours. I feel it strong. I'll give my last dose a little time and then dose the percocet. Maybe some Valium a little later. I have a tolerance, so no worries there.

Hello RTP. I have learned with this medication that timing is everything. I agree that it dampens and depending on the dosage, I have found it strong enough to overpower opiates and benzodiazepines. 

I just came off a 15 day break from the Lyrica. If I continue to use at this dose, I'll run out, so after today, proper stacking.


I am working on making it (300mg to 450mg daily of Lyrica/pregabalin) interact optimally with up to 40mg of Valium Prn and up to 15mg of oxycodone 5/325). The other pain relever is 15mg to 30 mg of dextroamphetamine ER. That stuff really works wonders when taken with the oxycodone 5/325. They complement each other because the dextroamphetamine streaches out the pain medicine. 


This is all based on harm reduction using the lowest dosages possible.. Some days are better then others.

450mg a day is the optimal daily dose of pregabalin.  Some doctors go as high as 900mg a day, which is equivalent to 3600mg of gabapentin - which is the maximum daily dose for that drug.  Lyrica is six times as potent as gabapentin in terms of binding affinity to the alpha2delta auxiliary subunit of the voltage gated calcium channel. 


 But when I took lyrica, I found 450 (150 tid ) to work the best.

I agree. 450mg is plenty strong if used and timed correctly. Stacking really helps..

He means taking a pill every so often to "stack" the effect. It's used primarily with gabapentin. This isn't needed with Lyrica and not something I'd do as the tolerance accumulation is quite rapid...

Oh, so it's the same thing as staggering.  Got ya.  It's shouldn't be needed with pregabalin as it's bioavalability is >90%.

It's subjective. It's been 18 hours and I still feel it. Taking only so much an hour streaches it out. I've taken a gram at once before and it didn't hit me hard at all. This time I took 450mg every hour or two and reached 1350mg or 1500mg. I am still feeling it. It's wearing off, but still works.

That would be consistent with its activity at the l amino transporter.  So why do they say its bioavailability is >90%? if it saturates it like gabapentin does?

I'm still trying to figure that out. Say you have zero tolerance. If you took 300mg - 450mg at once, or even if you were used to 75mg, twice a day, that dose could kick your ass. I read a thread on here where it was agreed that staggering the doses, helped. I took other stuff last night, but if it isn't the Lyrica, then I have a nice afterglow. Since pregabalin/Lyrica is much stronger, maybe more can be taken up by the transporter.

That may very well be true. Maybe its 6 fold potency transfers over to the transporter as well.


Interesting side note.  Did you know that the l amino acid transporter is responsible for taking amino acids into neurons?  It also brings gabapentin and pregablin into the central neurons.  This is how they cause non-vesicular release of GABA from the presynaptic cell. 


Not many people know this.

Pregabalin - and other gabapentinoids like baclofen, gabapentin, pehnibut - are stimulatory in high dosages, and provoke hypomanic reactions in most people.

Please could you clarify in dummies terms.

I am tapering off pregabalin, was on 600mg at xmas, and now on 212mg, as I am dosing five times a day due to short duration of action, and to stop interdose withdrawals.

I cut 2mg a day, I was cutting 5mg a day at first but gradually decreased cuts when my dose got lower.

I take 0.4mg off each of the five doses I take in the day spaced evenly apart.

I am finding transdermal magnesium oil to be a great help in removing the symptoms I had when I was first addicted.

It's proving to be a success, the wd symptoms graadually faded and I hopefully should be off in about 3 months.

How do you get 212mg?


These doses aren't for pregablin.  Are you talking about a benzo?


Yes magnesium is great.  It blocks the NMDA receptor pore, so it helps a lot.


What do you want to me to clarify?  I meant that the gabapentin and pregabalin can enter the neuron and push GABA out.  No other drug can enter neurons except amphetamines, and they do so via transporter proteins.

I was told by my dr (at least 3 times) that Lyrica was not the type of medicine to create a "high". I am new to it and do not want to recover from yet another addiction. However, I do feel really different right now having taken about 1.5 hours ago. Could anyone explain what's meant by "high? If that is allowed sorry but the rules are confusing to me.

^welcome to the BL community!


Lyrica 'high' can be subjective depending on your bodies make up, height, weight, gender, tolerance to other GABAs etc.


It usually does kick in at the 1.5hr mark, leaving the user feeling slightly drunk, dizzy, wonky, sleepy, more talkative, less anxious, & less inhibited.


Some ppl hate these feelings while others, (like myself), enjoy it when I have a day where I don't have to drive or do anything too important. 


Many use a method called stacking. As in, you initially dose, then at regular periods dose again & again. Wouldn't recommend that until you're used to the effects. Also, it is addictive to some & there's many stories of horrid wds from lyrica. Myself, I've never suffered them.


Are you scripted it for pain or social anxiety? It's beginning to take over as a safer alternative to benzos where I live. Soon the medical community will figure out how good this medicine is also for opiate wds.


Be careful I guess I should warn you, especially as it seems you've had a prior addiction.


*most ppl go on to live a normal life when prescribed & sticking to that daily dose to help with neuropathic pain. It just becomes part of their routine & they quickly adjust to any 'side effects'

I've been taking Lyrica for close to two years now at  300mg twice a day for neuralgia caused by degeneration of the cervical region of the spine.  In the beginning it took away the pain and as a bonus alleviated all anxiety.  I am prescribed the maximum amount and quickly developed a tolerance.  It now does nothing but rids of three nasty withdrawal of missing a dose.  I tried taking a massive amount as an experiment which still did nothing.  I guess I am damned to taking this for life unless someone can offer help on how to get this medicine to regain it's effectiveness.

So I took about 1200mgs of Lyrica on a Friday and then 270mgs of Methadone on the next Saturday and needless to say this was a horrible idea. Sometime on Saturday night I woke up in the hospital because they were giving me a shot of Narcan. Worst feeling ever!! It's the exact opposite of feeling good on drugs. Was in the hospital for a fucking week. Really sucked.

I tapered from 600mg to 170mg, using water and a syringe, taking out a small cut each day.

I started on 5mg cuts, but when my signature withdrawl warning symptom comes, headaches, I reduce my cut.

high=feel 'good' off drugs, but careful with pregab, Im on a taper, was on 600mg now on 170mg, but could only do this painlessley by cutting daily and dosing 5 times a day, taking a cut out of each dose, started with 5mg daily cuts, as I hadnt been on 600 that long, and when iI got my signature withdrawal headache from the back of the head with pregab, I knew to reduce the cut. I now use 2mg cuts each day and the taper is going really smoothly. 170mg doesnt get me high, it just stops withdrawals and allows me to comme offf smoothly. I did have wds to start with but the tapering tapered them away.

Not so far, as I've been dosing 5 x a day, and splitting the cut between each dose.

Just been reducing cut as I get signature headache, but I reduced it again, today, in the absence of the headache, as I keep getting the runs.

I've been messing with the benzo beast and am on a huge dose yet the runs are still here, so i thought a cut in my daily pregab reduction may be in order.

Dose regularly, dissolve in water, cut daily, and cut at each dose, (splitting cut between dose), reduce cut when synmptpoms appear, updosing slightly to a dose you felt better at if necessary, thats how I got from 600mg to 168.75mg

I've been reading this thread and I'm one of the few people that doesn't get many withdrawal symptoms. I'm on a pretty low dose and start alternating days went I want to get off. I just feel "meh" for a few days. But since I take it for radiculopathy, the pain comes back rather quickly.

For those using pregabalin for pain,- I just saw a new PM dr who says amongst themselves lyrica is the biggest con-markerted med on the market , that only one outta seven with neuropathic pain get analgesia from it.

I take it for recreation, so what would I know.. Anyone care to chime in ?!?

Hey guys, how often and how much gabapentin can I take without experiencing withdrawal symtoms? Would 1600mg per week be safe?

I saw that and my guess is everybody's biochemistry is different. I take a low dose for radiculopathy and it does work. No more tingles and nerve pain. Which returns if I stop the dosage. It's the only oral medication that stops the symptoms-my other option would be injection therapy. No thanks. I literally can't afford the time off for epidurals or facet joint injections. And I'm not comfortable with how much steroid is used.

^I take quite a high dose of lyrica & previously Gabapentin & it helped immensely with the shooting leg pains I experienced at night in bed.


Thankfully those times have passed & I now just take it prn.


Clearly though, it's been mass marketed with kick backs for prescribing drs with sales at a record high. Pretty much every pain dr has their patients on it.

do u think Pregbalin (Lyrica) and Gabapentin (Neurontin) are pretty much the same med? They seem to be used for same purpose. Just difference in potency, hence the dosage difference I think... I read that lyrica is 6x more potent than Neurontin.

^Yes, when Lyrica was released it was referred to as gabapentins 'big brother'. 


Most, if not all chronic pain patients I know have now been switched to lyrica.


Sorry to hear you're suffering such pain and withdrawal symptoms by coming off it. I never had wds, so I have nothing to offer in that area sorry.

Two points: 


- 1/7 actually are pretty good odds.
- Judging the efficacy of any medication from the prevalence of advertising used to sell said medication would be very mistaken indeed.

I've been led to believe that a medication can only be released to the market once it helps at least 1/5 patients.


With the rate of prescribing pregabalin, & if these stats are correct, I'd say mass prescription compared to efficacy of the drug would be the reason Pfizer would be increasingly advertised.


It's actually the only prescription drug advertised in our country.


Anyway, I know for sure Gabapentin helped my shooting leg pains at night, perhaps so did lyrica when I switched to it, (ahem, at my drs request), though I may not have given it a decent trial.


I'll also attest how great it works for opi wds, as many BLs are aware of, & I'm sure it won't be too long until Pfizer catches on to this too. Or they probably already have.


Whether they want to be known as a company that assists with this is yet to be known, they may pass it down to sell to another pharmaceutical company.

The pain is definitely not a wd effect since I only feel pain in one area (where I got injured). I just had surgery again last week to address this issue. I hope the pain will go away by itself.

I have pressure on nerve roots  in my back and Lyrica worked great in the beginning almost night and day and still decently when my dose got doubled but that soon lost it's effectiveness. After 2 1/2  years and  already  fearing the withdrawal decided I didn't want to increase my dose and detoxed instead. Even though I still take them 1-2 times a week I miss being  on them at night but I don't want to go through that hell again.

Any noticeable difference? Doubt it given the doses you have previously taken, but I've read other posts that say a break as little as a week,(almost there ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png), can help with tolerance to lyrica.


Don't be too hard on yourself, as you say, you had stuff to do, & doing anything while in wd is close to impossible.


Tomorrow's another day, just pick up where you left off m'k?

I can't imagine the withdrawal from that size of habit, 200-300mg was bad enough. I don't recall ever having nightmares coming off but I was also using cannabis every night to sleep, weed  either keeps me from dreaming or makes it so I don't ever remember them. Sorry I can't be more helpful.

I can relate with the weird vivid dreams. I have dreams of dead relatives being alive and we're all having a merry old time. Then I wake up thinking I'm in my old house only to realise I'm not and my parents aren't here anymore. It's a bitch but, I do like having the nice dreams. I was having constant nightmares at one stage until they stopped.

Geeez guys, I wonder if some are super sensitive to lyrica (& hence have the awful wds).


I've never really taken lyrica daily as I don't like feeling stoned ALL the time, but prior to being scripted that I was taking 2400mg Gabapentin daily which helped my leg pains for a year or so but then became ineffective so I just stopped one day & was fine.


That was prior to me being a knowledgable BLer (IMHO), & prior to lyrica being released over here.


Had no idea such a med could cause wds, though 2400mg gaba is quite different to 2g lyrica lol.

Today I've taken 600mgs and I'm gonna take more....

Go by how u feel. Rule of thumb is to wait 2 hrs to see how u feel. So dose 600 mg, wait 2 hrs to fully kick in then increase gradually with smaller dosages just to be safe. I know I've taken too much when I feel wasted /  dru k outta my ass

Cool Strity, you're doing good!


The above poster, read far enough back on the thread & you'll hear of ppl literally falling down, passed out, onto the concrete footpath.


I'd be careful, but I believe it's quite hard to OD on lyrica or gabapentin youre far more likely to take too much & blackout or fall  asleep then to die.


Of course, err on the side of caution.

Hi im new to this. My dog Edgar just wondering if anyone has taken 1200mg Lyrica and 450gm of Tramadol or something close to this dosage. Edgar has a high tolerance to both these tablets. Edgar sometimes takes a high dose of lyrica. Sometimes up to 1400mg. But he gets jittery and occasionaly has seizures. But he said he feels good. He gets chattery and and wants to socialise.tonighy he took 450mg of Tramadol and 1200 mg Lyrica. He realises he shoud of taken a lower dose of tramadol . He is starting to get jittery. And twitching. Which always happens when he takes high doses. 


So has anyone done this? Should i be worried. Keeping in mind Edgar has been taking these tablets for over a year. But never done tramadol at such a high dose before.

If you "occasionally" have seizure I wouldn't consider that, hell even 450mg of tramadol is sort of a crapshoot for many people. I have experience with very high doses of gabapentin/neurontin (lyrica's weaker cousin) and I have gotten these "jitters" as well but I've never had an actual seizure. It seems to fit the definition of myoclonus more than anything.


And there is no need to do the "SWIM" thing here. Read the board rules, cheers

I was prescribed lyrica for lumbar radiculitis and a pinched s1 nerve. Started on 100mg x 3. Definitely helpful for my nerve pain and general mood. Especially when stacked with Norco 10mgs.  But even by itself, i feel it's useful. 


I'm tempted to play around with the dose for the recreational effects, but don't want to jack up my tolerance too fast. Plus, the wd symptoms sound fierce.

Damn Kirkland, i can't even imagine! I've only been on lyrica 3 weeks at 300mg / day. It's been amazing for my sciatica pain and mood. I haven't noticed any dreams or nightmares, but i do smoke cannabis nightly. 


How long have you been off the lyrica?

Haha Amazon, that's about the perfect song to describe 600mg of pregabalin. From what I've read in this thread, and please correct me if I'm wrong, it is very difficult to od from lyrica, but the body quickly tolerates higher dosages and wd can be a bitch for some people. Good luck!

Don't beat yourself up for it. WD's are hard, I've been daily cutting since xmas, was on 600mg now on 142mg. Been reducing daily cuts when telltale pregabalin unique headache heralds itself. On 2mg cuts now. I split my dose and my cuts, dose 4 x a day, so far, seems to have really helped with wds. Awww btw magnesium oil has also helped.

I wouldn't worry about becoming twitchy on lyrica. I would worry about using your dogs name as that's what the Feds look for as well as your ISP.

Warning-gross post


I was recreationally taking 225mg to 450mg in one dose on weekdays, believing the 72hr gap in the weekend would protect me from addiction.

Anyway, I decided I Wanted a day off lyrica one monday morning, and I farted in bed, only it was liquid stool.

I knew, at this point, I was addicted, so I split 450mg into four doses throughout the day, but it wasn't holding me, symptoms still came, bad diarrhoea, anxiety, anger, depression, etc, so I upped it to 150mg four times a day, and started a daily taper regime of 5mg cut a day, 1.25mg per 6hrly dose, and reduced the cuts as things got sore on the way down. I'm currently on 142mg pregab and 2mg daily cuts, 0.5mg cut per dose, and so far, its going well for me. A unique headache heralds when I need to reduce the daily cut.

Lyrica is a life saver drug. Almost too good to be true at first. But I have not had one full rested night of sleep ever since i stopped it. So now I am back on it. Like I said when I take it, it always works. But i have to take it everyday like antidepressant medication.

No see this was 3 months ago.

Hello, everybody I got two questions regarding lyrica and opiates. I was using  lyrica to help the withdraw symptoms due to  my opana script running out 2 weeks early. I used 600mg of lyrica the first week. And week 2 I used the lyrica more for recreation and used high amounts ranging from 1g to 2g. Here is where my question comes in. I get my opana script filled tommr. Will I have withdraw symptoms from quitting  lyrica cold turkey from a 2 week binge on it. Also If I do experience withdraw symptoms from lyrica will the opana help combat them? Sorry 1 more quick question. If the opana does not help should I start a taper with lyrica?

^imho a two wk binge on lyrica  shouldn't be quite enough to experience wd symptoms, stretch it out any longer though & your sure to feel somewhat out of sorts.


Many may disagree as you were taking up to 2grams in the second week, it's all subjective,- you may experience severe wds, then again, feel no difference once back on your opiate.


Personally, I used pregabalin for 'bridging' for a week or two most months for over two years, (when I started to have opi issues). Did more good than harm I can tell you!!


If the Opana doesn't make you feel as 'good' as usual, try 3-600mg lyrica as well,- you'll soon know if you need a low dose to prevent pregabalin wds, (of which I've never experienced).


Let us know how it goes,

I'm considering dropping my daily pregabalin use from 150mg to 125mg per day this week, as I'm ill with an infection so I've taken a week off work (I'm on it for anxiety, it does nothing except keep my out of WD's, I'm tolerant, been taking it at various doses for 5 months). 


I will need to be back at work in 7 days time (next Tuesday). From your experience do you think this would be enough time to deal with any anxiety from the drop and for my body to readjust to a new baseline? I have an anxiety disorder and can't cope with work if I have worse-than-baseline anxiety (am struggling even at a baseline level, but I want to get off the pregabalin, as it affects my libido and causes some genital numbness). 


When I've dropped 25mg in the past, I don't think I've felt any WD for about 4 days and then only mildly, lasting 2-3 days. Which would just about put me in the clear. However, I've had more serious WD (from taking higher doses) a couple of times since then so I might be more susceptible now. 


I'd be interested in any comments. Thanks.

^ Well dropping 16% of your dose could have some effect.. I would think 7 days would be enough to recover. Is there a specific reason you want to drop your dose?

I used to take 300mg a day I dropped to only 100mg bedtime then Then 50mg bedtime  next few days.... Another trick is drop 100% of your dose few days at least 3-7 and when you feel the worst possible, take the lowest dose possible and it will work better than your previous doses ever did... You just reserved tolerance and sped up tapering process by going cold turkey.


Never been a fan of tapering but if you do, just go cold turkey off the higher doses then resume a taper few days after the worst wd symptoms over...


For example if you take heroin, stop completely for 5 days, then resume taper process...


I call this the "just get it over with" method, by the time you tapered down to 0 your body will be free of paws as well. If you do regular taper, u will feel a bit crap with dose decrease, then paws following week... Why draw out the pain?

^ well he's not trying to quit completely.. Still waiting on word as to why he wants to lower his dose in the first place. But his anxiety is at a level in which cold turkey would be problematic.

One can train themselves the suffering brought on by withdrawals of cold turkey. What I did in a matter of days one can taper off in a month...but I did if in a couple of days and I'm ready to use again! I use drugs a lot then stop completely, suffer, then repeat, it's part of the process. I have never been able to taper, it's like, "okay I dont feel good, this sucks, I might as well just go all the way since I'm not having a good time"


Yes I might be bias because i could never tapered off in my life. If I have any drugs left to taper , I will just use them to get a buzz. When I run out, I can withdraw. After so many withdraws you become used to it. There's nothing "problematic", accept the suffering is part of life, in exchange for happiness . 

**The beauty in this there is no uncertainty, you know when you use, you feel good, your day will be great. When you don't, your day will suck. Thats called being completely control.** More control than non drug users, they could have a loss of a loved one and they will be sad. But me, a drug user? No my day will be great NO MATTER WHAT unless I decide not to make it that way!


Tl:;dr go cold turkey, if you suffer..keep going till ur 100%...then  go use a lot and ct again, and again till you no longer perceive it as suffering!

Thanks for your post. Two reasons:


1. It's not giving me any anxiolytic effect, and hasn't done for a couple of months, and I don't want to raise my dose to get this, because eventually tolerance will catch up. So there's no point being on it- the longer I stay on it, the worse WD will be. I don't often get an opportunity to have 7 days without working so it's a good opportunity to take the hit of some of the anxiety. Better to do a bit of the taper when sick than when on holiday and potentially ruin part of the holiday...but my anxiety is such that I can't do it whilst working.


2. As I mentioned, and despite it not doing anything positive for me, I'm sure it's giving me sexual side effects. Reduced libido, and reduced genital sensitivity, and sometimes other stuff. It's not so bad that I can't function sexually (which was true at the higher doses) but it's rather annoying, when I'm not getting anything good "in exchange".


At the same time, I really don't want my anxiety to be above baseline in a week's time when I return to work.

I can sort of understand where you are coming from. I used to think somewhat in that way. But I am not using pregabalin recreationally, so I don't think it applies. As a side point, I think you'd still feel the loss of a loved one, there are certain pains you can't escape through drugs, and probably for good reason.

Last night iI took 425 mg Lyrica and my usual 2 mg Lorazepam and I slept like a corpse! This morning I feel the same exact hangover as when I drank alcohol every day. It kinda sucks, but I've been tapering off  oxycodone for a while now and right now I have no cravings for oxy, just a hangover.

Random question - curious if anyone ever experienced anything similar:

8 year 500mg daily Codeine addiction here.

Discovered Lyrica from the GP for anxiety but discovered quickly how great the 400-500mg made me. Was great at potentiating opiates as discussed here many times!

But as with many here I had the problem of tolerance! - 2/3 days in a row would mean no more Lyrica fun until I waited for tolerance to drop. Did this for 2 months.

Then went CT on the codeine. Difference is this time I had the Lyrica (which I'd read here could help with the WDs) and it helped massively in the higher doses. Stopped taking it a week into WDs as the worst were over.

Fast forward 2 months in with no opiates and I found my old Lyrica box and popped a couple to see what would happen! As expected; it got me trashed. It was awesome.

So I had some again. And again. And again.

Now I'm 2 months on (4 months since opiates) and haven't built any tolerance to Lyrica. Heck; 100mg (my rx'd dose) gets me completely trashed every day and 600 is an almost scary level of wasted. Day in; day out.

What I'm curious of is if this has happened to anyone else or what the thoughts may be on this as to why? I'm not complaining at the lack of no tolerance but at the same time very curious as to what may of changed in my brain at what level to allow this to happen!

Really bad idea as Lyrica is a GABAergic and cold turkey can lead to really nasty withdrawal symptoms

Just curious as to how those people useing this for anxiety find it? I'm on 50 mg valium a day for the last 2 years before that a big taper off zanax. Is it worth even asking the doc about with my current benzo tollerence its been bugging me for a while now so i thought i'd put it out there.

IME it works well for a while but does not take long to get tolerant and then it does nothing except keep you out of WD. I've tried using it more on a PRN basis but that led to rebound anxiety after a while. Overall I'd say it's like benzos, good for short-term anxiety but in the long-term will just get you dependent and no longer help with anxiety, unless you keep upping the dose, and 600mg per day is the max dose, which you can get to very quickly.

SMFG, I think it depends on whether you're wanting to taper off benzos or attempt to lower your tolerance by trying an alternative, or continue to treat your anxiety.

^they're pretty much the same, lyrica is stronger,- about x3 iirc, mg for mg.


I've never heard of anyone mixing the two, except in the case of running out of lyrica & finding some Gabapentin to tide you over in granny's cupboard :/

You also don't need to stack prebabalin to increase the bioavailability like you do with gabapentin.

We may be thinking two different things. By stacking gabapentin I meant lets say you're prescribed 100mg 3x a day. It has been said that taking all 300mg at once would be less absorbed than if you were to take 100g every 30-40 minutes (tramadol is like this as well). With pregabalin(Lyrica) the same amount is absorbed regardless if you take it all at once or take it like above.

It has been said that taking all 300mg at once would be less absorbed than if you were to take 100g every 30-40 minutes (tramadol is like this as well). With pregabalin(Lyrica) the same amount is absorbed regardless if you take it all at once or take it like above.

Again, not really intending to get high, but it staves off withdraw symptoms almost entirely, aside from the dumb sneezes.

In theory,  taking it that way should get more of the drug  into your system but will it be more effective? I don't know, someone else will have to chime in on that as my experience is only with Lyrica.

I have been on and off lyrica for all most a year. Just tried 5 75mg capsules to feel really drunk after an hour of it kicking in. Coordination is unstable , tried walking heel to toe, was a a complete fail. Overall feel really groggy, a little tricky to describe the feeling. I'm an hour into to it. Will report back throughout the rest of it. I took 3 first and another 2 thirty minutes later.

I've been stuck on neurontin bc i am on suboxone, i am having a hard time being prescribed any benzo. when i tried to quit my gabapentin, the psychological part is INSANE. i was si scared i almost checked myself into the hospital. i know lyrica is kind of the same thing. both work on your GABBA receptors. i was afraid to switch to lyrica. now I'm definitely not doing it after reading these posts.

I have been reading what a lot of people are saying. I am on 600mg of prefab a day. Today I have taken 3900mg and I am absolutely flying. From what you all are saying you seem to say there is no point taking more than 900 I have taken 1200 and 900 and 1600 and trust me taking 3900 is completely different. It feels like i am in eutopia. I don't know all the medical lingo but could someone tell me why tumour think you should only take a 900mg. My info may be coming of a different post to this but any info would be greatly appreciated!

Someone posted here that they now get trashed on a low dose of Lyrica. It's happening to me too!

Originally i took 300 mg x 3 per day Neurontin for about 3 months. Quit for 2 months. Changed to Lyrica 100 mg x 2 per day for 3 months, 150 mg x 2 per day for 1 month. Then quit that because it was making my teeth hurt. All the time I never really felt anything. (I take oxy also)

 3 months later now and 250 mg Lyrica gets me sooooo drunk, and it lasts for about 12 hours. It's f'ing awesome except the hangover lasts for the whole next day.

I'm sure this is a dumb question, but is there anything OTC that is similar to Gabapentin? Not to get high, but really just stave off withdraw/pain.

Yes, you can buy kava. It may have a similar mechanism of action to gabapebtinoids. YMMV. Don't expect to get high off it

One thing that baffles me is how people talk about getting super high off lyrica. Literally every time I take it, it just puts me to sleep. I feel way to tired to fight the urge to sleep. How do you guys even stay awake??? Or this an effect you get at only very high doses?


Lyrica is fantastic for opioid potentiation though.

Do you usually eat after you take it?  When I take it and get the buzz, if I eat I will pass the F out.

I realise this is a much belated response but I have exactly the same experience .... I can take 900mg, wait 2 hours, sit down and close my eyes and away I go. Feels like my brain being almost able to percieve the 4th dimension

I'll expand. It seems my experience is somewhat different to many others. I'm prescribed Pregabalin 600 mg a day. I'm British so they're free. If I take 1200 mg and wait 2 hours ...... I feel an overwhelming relaxation, and if I sit and close my eyes I feel like I've slipped into another dimension, clear visuals although mild. Still fully aware but have to be careful to fight sleep to keep it going. It lasts for hours. Then I take 300 mg for a week and can repeat the process .... however odd times I've run out the withdrawal is very bad ..... no sleep ...... irritable ...... an itch I can't descride mixed with a bit of an opiate withdrawal. I've been on these at this dose for 2 years.

I think I've just never taken enough lyrica in one go to get the recreational effects. If I take much more than 150 I can't fight the urge to sleep

150 mg of Pregabalin is nowhere near enough to enter the state I mentioned, even with zero tolerance ..... when you feel the strong sedation coming on after about 40 mins, keep busy for another hour ? .... then try relaxing in a safe place and closing your eyes. You should be able to bypass the initial urge to sleep. Just make sure you're in a safe place. Be careful of dosage, as I have tolerance.

Hmm I've tried taking around 300 mg and I could not stay awake when it was kicking in... i woke up like 6 hours later, so I basically slept through the experience. That's the most I've taken. I just doubt I can stay awake for a mega dose if anything over 150 knocks me out cold. Maybe I just don't have the right brain chemistry for it

Do you eat after you take the Lyrica?  Within any time period after you take it?  If you take it any time after while the buzz is going, sleep will always consume you.

So i went to a shrink for dissociation, derealization and trouble focusing and remembering stuff.. and um she told me I probably have repressed anxiety? Like i don't really feel anxious but I guess i am? :/ idk anyways she gave me lyrica for it and what's you guys' experience with taking it for that purpose? I mean some of the side effects seem to be literally the stuff I've been trying to get rid of? I'm prescribed 25 mg twice a day, last night i took it for the first time and it.. did give me some sort of short lived high, at first a weird anesthetic feeling throughout my body, some energy and euphoria.. similar to tramadol tbh. this morning I took it again and idkkk I feel a bit high and weird but also anxious which.. lmao what the fuck..

Google is pretty cool.  25mg is very small in terms of dosage. Keep in mind, Lyrica has a huge chance for dependance as well as quick tolerance.  Soooo when you run out... it might suck a bit.

If you don't mind me asking a question that has probably been asked a million times before:


My doc prescribed me 75 mg of Lyrica. What is a good starting dose for a small guy like me(5'9, 154) if I want that euphoria some people talk about. I am going to see my doc in a couple of weeks, should I ask for the 300 mg tablets?

Without a tolerance, 75 mg might give you a good buzz. 


Don't ask for 300 mg tablets.... They're not a thing... 75 mg is actually a high starting dose

It's not that high of a starting dose for anxiety even for anxiety imo - it's what I started at for that indication. For anticonvulsant effects the doses are quite a bit higher.


300 mg capsules are a thing. If I were your doctor though I would be really suspicious of why you would ask for such a dosage unless you have some serious neurpathy or convulsive activity (in which case, don't abuse these!)... 150 mg is less suspect and I would just find other ways of making clear that you have a high tolerance and are running through them quickly. You better prepare a decent story for asking for more and more... worse than not getting what you want is having a doctor who doesn't trust you.


Why do you take them though?


The magic/euphoria you're talking about (which should happen at 150-225 and above) does go away relatively soon, although other actions are still effective. Still, depending on why you are taking this you should not make a habit out of taking high doses as it's not worth ruining an effective treatment for that reason. If you don't even feel that you need any help from them and wouldn't care if they become ineffective then by all means.

300mg Pregabalin capsules are a thing Slow! They just don't have them stateside yet as far as I can tell. Another thing we don't have? Generic versions of this shit. I feel that if a naive user wanted to experience the full range of recreational effects that Pregabalin has to offer, 300mg is appropriate. I personally do 600mg to start even when I have no tolerance. Of course, it's always wise to perform some sort of allergy/sensitivity test prior to diving in.


Pregabalin belongs to a class of drugs known as the Gabapentinoids. This class includes Gabapentin (Neurontin), Pregabalin (Lyrica) and Phenibut along with other similar, but novel and unused variations like 4-Methylpregabalin, Atagabalin etc. They're well known for their exceptionally wide therapeutic index. They are practically harmless, although some experience non-epileptic convulsions at very high dosages, even these don't appear to be dangerous. So, experiment away.


Solipsis has made some good points though. Acute tolerance is a distinguishing characteristic of this class of drugs. It grows expontentially from dose to dose. I've taken +60g Gabapentin in 24hr periods on several occasions. I'm not proud of it, but hell, I was really dope sick and it helped. Bear in mind, this high dosage was due to tolerance over the prior 3 days. I started on day one with 4.5g. +1000% increase over the course of days.

That's very surprising, but I stand corrected. 


I still think it's a bad idea to ask for 300mg capsules when your doctor has you on 75 mg. That's a huge jump. Asking for 150 mg doses would be much more reasonable if 75 mg doesn't do anything for you.


Most studies look at 600 mg/day as a maximum effective dosage, so I wouldn't expect your doctor to give you more than that. 200 mg 3x a day is a pretty common maximum dosage, but of course some might go over that if there's good reason to. Doctors will usually try something else if 150 3x a day still doesn't work, so be careful about pushing your luck

I know this all too well.  I wish they made Generic versions of this earlier.  However, they wont until 2018.  They were in a pretty deep lawsuit, in which they lost, to the people wanting to prescribe this for anxiety.  The VA wont prescribe it until it's generic.  The bastards.  


It works better for pain, as it's a nerve relief.


I would also recommend caution with this, as over usage makes the tolerance grow, which can be very quick as stated above. Also, the withdraw from this is no fun.  Not as bad as opioids, but the anxiety and depression is pretty brutal...  That's one of the reasons why I think it's stupid that a DR would prescribe this for anxiety... if those said people abuse this, they will have anxiety even worse... plus, that shit is in your head... sitfu.

I live in the netherlands and requested this out of the blue for anxiety as a part of ASD and was given it, for about 2 years during which the most part of the first year was amazingly effective and the rest of the time it was still moderately effective. I did get some tolerance but not stupidly high or dangerous tolerance, nor any clear and blatant withdrawal symptoms if I skipped a day, or withdrawal from the effects dropping off after a dose. But yes the anxiety and depression were really brutal when I tapered and quit which was also entirely my own decision...

Weirdly I did not feel like I wanted to take as much as I could like with having to withdraw from benzos or opioids. Instead I felt encouraged to just take as little as possible and get off it. The nasty anxiety and depression for some reason were not linked to taking the drug!


I only 'abused' this on occasion although there were enough days where I took a significant bit extra for non-recreational reasons and other days when I didn't take any at all... none of that gave me additional anxiety like fucking with benzos like that would give me. So, considering that there are almost no good medications to give for anxiety anyway, I think pregabalin is one of the least bad ones for it. But it's not effective (enough) for everyone or every type of anxiety. My ex and best friend have both been on it, but I had the best effects from it apparently.


I am seriously considering going on it again though... the withdrawals were more or less the only big downside (I should be able to manage such a temporary thing again). Minor downsides were the loss of coordination, issues with driving / driving lessons.


It does have a good therapeutic index but I think I was lucky not really having any serious side effects, some people get pretty nasty shit from it.. but I guess with most medications some people lose out hard. I just hope that my odds of that don't get too big as my total lifetime use becomes longer / more chronic.


Last time I brought pregabalin up again with my psychiatrist (a different one than initially started prescribing it), and suggested putting me on it for incidental use. I agreed to just hold off for a few weeks and take the time to reconsider which is a good idea... but he said it is not proven to be effective for incidental use.

In my experience, it is definitely effective that way and works wonders immediately for me. Also with incidental use I hope to build less tolerance and reset more of my tolerance which apparently also happens quickly. I really hope he would agree with incidental use (otherwise I will get a full time script I think, if he agrees), and also hope that I can get a new honeymoon with it that could perhaps be longer than the first one.

I was up to 300 mg/day for spine surgery, along with oxycodone and Lorazepam. Quitting cold turkey only gave me insomnia. I tapered for about two weeks with no WD's at all. But the Lorazepam was probably controlling my anxiety.

Now 250 mg gets me trashed exactly like tequila, and i wake up hungover the same. I spend about 8 hours wandering from falling asleep to having energy and clarity to get chores done around the house. No way I could drive in that condition. BUT I am tapering off oxy right now and last night the lyrica I took did help me to drop my oxy dose by 25% without WD's or cravings. I may be forced to do it again tonight if I can't hanfle the new lower dose. I really want to stay on target with my oxy taper.

To me it doesnt make sense why it would work for derealization or attention disorders.

I do have ADD but only found out earlier this year, i have also taken lyrica for nearly 2 years for ASD related anxiety issues (feeling stuck in stressed or frustrated feelings from minor things constantly).

It works well for the anxiety and my plan to go back on lyrica was approved today.

It did nothing for my attention aside from zoning me out if the dose is too high.


My unrelated question is whether occasional but frequent use like 3 days a week would be destabilizing due to mini withdrawals?

I never noticed anything like that in the past from skipping days, but I also did not associate my withdrawal syndrome with discontinuation when I tapered and quit.

Lyrica is weird like that! (to me)

I tried this but it didn't work for me. I should mention that I reacted very strangely to lyrica so my experience probably isn't typical, but I felt a lot better after I completely stopped using it. 


Before I was dependent on lyrica it was a fantastic med that I could use without any negative side effects, but now I can only take it very infrequently without getting rebound or hangover symptoms. It's weird.

What apparently caused you to develop this aversive reaction you think? You just took it therapeutically?

How long were you on it and how did you use it when you could not tolerate using it frequently? Was it ever since being dependent and coming off it that you don't react well anymore?


I really hope that doesn't happen to me..

I personally prefer gabapentin (1600mg staggered over 6 hours) to lyrica (450mg, then 300mg 2-4 hours later). Only mildly.  Much less than say I prefer dexedrine over adderall.  And yea, lots of experience as I had all 4 as scripts.  right now gabapentin for rls (600mg times 3), also my doctor gives my 30 norcos for my legs as well.  I was using kratom (and prefer it to low dose hydrocodone for RLS), but am unsure of the legality now.  also 30mg vyvanse, which I am just collecting every month.  I don't use any adhd meds anymore.

I really hope that doesn't happen to me..[/QUOTE]


Initially, I took it semi-regularly without a problem like a few times a week, but I quickly started taking it every day. I was prescribed it every day for pain so I was using it therapeutically. For awhile, it was a miraculous cure for pain and insomnia. But after a month or two it completely stopped working for me, and during the day, I felt nearly psychotic, so I started taking it every morning and night. Taking it in the morning made me semi-retarded during the day and completely killed my motivation to do anything. I still think it's weird that lyrica had such a pronounced effect on my cognition, because I'm highly functional on benzos and can do research/study no problem. 


My doctor spent quite awhile adjusting dosage strength, frequency, etc, but for some reason, not taking it made me crazy while taking it made me stupid and lazy. The worst part is that the therapeutic effect on pain and insomnia completely disappeared, so I had the side effects with none of the benefit. Plenty of people seem content taking high doses over prolonged periods of time, so I don't know how common my experience really is.


After I finally got off the lyrica altogether, I've tried revisiting it a couple times. I've tried using it recreationally, but for me, it was pretty worthless as a rec drug. I've tried using it semi-regularly again just as a sleep aid, but I always feel depressed and anxious the next day. It's fucking weird and it sucks. Now I'll only use it for CTing opioids.


.  should also mention that I was on it for about 6 months total, and months after quitting, my tolerance doesn't seem to have dropped at all. But like I said, I wouldn't assume my reaction is a typical one. Just thought I'd share my experience though.

THE GOOD,  BAD, and  UGLY of lyrica...

Im 29 now but age 18 I was prescribed lyrica.for 7 straight years of atleast 600mg-750mg daily and significantly worked wonders for my fibro and then one day the side effects slowly started damaging my mind until something went completely wrong and I lost my mind and WENT CRAZY. Needless to say I quit taking it. I am now very concerned of the long term mental effects it very well may have caused. Has anyone had a bad experience or anyone know the mental effects or any effects it has after long term use.

Im on 750mg also, and it appears that after 8 years of use, im in tolerance withdrawal.... So kind of looking ways to get out. Depakote might help, thats my best bet, but who knows.. Atleast it should slow me down a bit, which would mean easier tapering. Seems like at 900mg, im ok, i mean if i take an extra capsule. so who knows, i just doubt that my doctors would agree to give it to me at 900mg dose a day ...... At the time i started taking it i was told it is a perfectly safe drug, and i may take it as long as i like, and as high dosage as possible. Now its a different world out there.

MGLA - Keep a dose handy at night. I have been using pregablin to help with oxy wd's. 4 days of use gets me one night of insomnia. Day 5 I take about 20% of my 4 day dose 2 hours before bed or I won't sleep. I only need one day at the lower dose and all is good.

haha, i asked my doctor long time ago now.. to try this medication, he started ne ib 25mg twice a day,   then 1 week later 75mg twice a day, then 150 mg then i went to him saying well  my tolerance must of gone up..  so i got the  red white capsule of 300mg,  2 dailys...  i musr of got 6 boxes of them.. i dont take them anymore...  was wondering if they would help for a withdrawal of oxycodone ( 200mg a day )  and personally  they give me a huge boost in energy the lyrica ... but i get none of the other effect, that some people mention.

sorry if this question was already answered!!!

Hello I'm new but came across this, I take lyrica everyday for fibromyalgia and have never gotten high. I take 6 150s a day and my tolerance grew really fast and if I forget to . Take it regularly I have severe sickness, anxiety, ect, do I just not take enough? I'm am opiate, Coke, lover they give me so much energy and I love being up.  I never had a high tolerance for opiates and have never iv but I was taking about 320 mg of oxy a day and some nights  I would also mix A gram and a half of Coke with it and I would do everything really fast like the gram and a half in like an hour really quick best feeling but anyways not about that the lyrica gave me that energy that opiates give me and I found that it also helps with opiate withdrawals in a major way, opiate withdrawals are the shits but lyrica helped so

Much I didn't even know I was withdrawling  except for a few trip to the bathroom and I sweat constantly! I took my last pill 4 days ago. It doesn't help with the pain but I can't stop taking it because it makes me so energized and talkative and my social anxiety is gone it wonderful but now I'm stuck on 6 a day I'm trying wean down the wd are so bad and tolerance to it raises in like a few days

Some people have little or no wd's from Lyrica. About 10-20% of users have miserable wd's that can last for several weeks. If you've done it for a few days and it's not getting better then it's really time to ask a doctor for help tapering off.

High all, I'm not trying to hijack a thread,but I was wondering how does one feel, stacking Lyrica 150 mg, at least go 600 mg, then smoking hash or weed on top of it ? I' know that when I've tried, the best I would feel numb. 


Anyone do this ?

I used to love it I would get way higher for way longer. Now that i smoke on lyrica i also just get a numb feeling. I am guessing this has to do with tolorence.

Spideronthewall- I think what's important with Lyrica is the same with all pharmaceuticals. Understand the risks and decide if the cure is worse than the disease. 

It doesn't matter if Lyrica could give you brain damage, when your only other choice is severe depression and life crushing anxiety.

I wholeheartedly agree with you squeaky.

Thats how I feel with all meds. I live a life of constant constipation and have gained over 30 lbs in the last year but methadone keeps me feeling normal and happy unlike how I was when I was shooting Opies and running around trying to hustle everyday.

Lyrica makes me dizzy and tired but it helps about 80% of my anxiety so why would I ever stop?


Just gotta way the pros and cons. Life has cross-roads

^ Edibles work way better on both gabapentin and lyrica from personal extensive use in the past. Yeah idk about dxm but if you can take 2-3 day breaks it becomes way more enjoyable and you can lower your dose. Right now am taking it for bupe w/d and its helping somewhat but 3 days ago it helped 80% better good luck bro.

Do you really get high from it? I have a perscription for it and it works very well but reading this thread inspired me to try and abuse it, but 450 mg produced nothing I'd call a high. I'll stick to my very low dose perscription (3 x 25 mg per day for anxiety and pain) since it works very well and there's no point in ruining a good thing.

When I was started on Lyrica, I had already been on Neurontin for months. Then they upped my Lyrica to 150mg x 2/day. Never felt anything.

Quit Lyrica for a month, then one dose of 300 mg would hit me like 10 shots of good tequila. But I built my tolerance right back wiyhin 3 days, then had to deal with wd's for a week.

I have since decided it's not worth it. I can get the tequila without a prescription. It's cheaper than my damn copayment, and the hangover never lasts more than one day!

Start with 150 mg on an empty stomach. Wait at least an hour in a quiet place. Keep some saltine crackers on hand in case your stomach gets upset . If you feel nothing then take 75 each hour up to 450 mg max. Lyrica takes an hour or two to have full effect, but the effect can be offset by stress or exercise. You don't want to miss it or overdose because you were at the gym or arguing with your landlord. Beware it is a lot like alcohol and you may get drowsy and just fall asleep. If you do, it will be the best sleep you ever had. Don't do it two days in a row regardless of the reason. (google Lyrica withdrawls) DON'T DRIVE ANYWHERE. Have a solid meal when it hits, like steak and potatoes. The extra endorphin rush from a full stomach will potentiate the effect and slow absorption of any pills left in your belly.

Be ready for the Lyrica hangover next day. It feels like you bathed in flea killer and lasts till noon.

 Thanks for this dude.  Answered all my questions. I'll come back with an update on Sunday.


I NEVER take the same substance two days in a row, and I always wait at least a week between my intake of the same drug to avoid physical dependence. I learned that the hard way. But how about taking a *different *drug the day after Lyrica? Like some Z-drug, Tramadol or Weed. My understanding is that Lyrica increases GABA in the brain, but it doesn't *connect to the GABA-receptors *like benzos does(something like that).


To be honest, I was going to try to boost my Zopiclone with Lyrica sometime, that's why I am asking.

I don't have any real experience combining multiple substances for added effects. Sorry , no advice there. I do take opiates every day, and I've never had any fun or problems mixing or replacing one with the other.  There probably is a magical combo, but I've never discovered it.

I had to take the Lyrica again tonight so as to stay on my Oxy tapering plan. I took 300 mg at 6pm. I ate a solid meal around 7:30. Took 200 mg more at 8:00. I'm feeling pretty drunk now since about 8:30. It's really helping with the oxy wd's. It feels like 10 shots of really good tequila. Kind of goes away when I get up and move around. Gets way stronger when I lie down and relax. It's like getting a massage and then falling asleep on the massage table.

I know the hangover tomorrow will suck a little, but it's better than oxy wd's now.

Pregablin got me smashed when I didnt take it everyday even now if i taKE 2 Days off at a lower dose I get a high from it, I take 300-450mg to potentiate opiates and for fibromyalgia I take 300 twice a day.

Now if I take just one 300 instead of 2 I get withdrawal similar to opiates and anxiety and a weird sense of dread if I go 24hours without I start to retch, Also could this be cause of my suicidal thoughts I have had them since age 13 though.

Everyone ive met loved pregabs, heroin addicts always beg me to give them one for when there rattling I say no though as I need them myself. might ask doctors to give me 200 3 x a day ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


For some reason 350mg is the dose you need to get high , when i use to just take 300 nothing same with my ex girlfriend when i gave her 400 though she was dancing in middle of street and had amazing sense of euphoria.

Lyrica is great in many respects. I'd be on Methadone or Suboxone for pain if my insurance company didn't already know I was on benzos.

It's killed the pain, made the phenibut taper very easy, and all around great. But...--


If has a high affinity towards the alpha2-delta sites, which through some neurological mess can cause  norepinephrine to not be released via calcium channels. Or something like that. Which means those that enjoy amphetamines will be greatly disappointed, as I was. Taking 200 mgs three times a day, not even 210 mgs of Adderall seems to get me where I'd like to be

Yo, I Tried 300 mg Lyrica two days ago. Worked fucking amazing. Completely killed my Tramadol-hangover. Today, 2 days later I took another 300 mg and felt NOTHING. And I really mean nothing at all. No dizziness, balance problems, euphoria etc. Wtf?


I took 300 mg last Friday and as I said it worked amazing at Tuesday, 4 days later. How many days should you wait between the doses for them to work? I read that tolerance on Lyrica builds fast. Lol, YOU DON'T SAY.


Lyrica also doesn't seem to work for me if I take benzos shortly before. Some people say Lyrica boosts benzos, it seems to be the complete opposite for me.

I used lyrica during opioid wds, i actually got it two weeks before jumping and tried one 150mgs and to my disbelief i was able to hold off a couple hours longer before redosing oxy.

So on my first day ops free i dosed 300mgs lyrica then another 150 or 300mgs later that day along with that i had weed brownies and clonidine. I weened down pretty low on oxy before jumping but still could not believe how great lyrica worked during wds, i was bumping into shit when i walked but i was able to get up and walk during the first day of wds. I even got weird ass energy from lyrica but mostly stoned feeling like drunk but happier. So on day two i was thinking it was from the brownies so i backed off the brownies and could not believe most of the stoned feeling was from the lyrica!. I had bluetooth headphones on during most of wds the combination of everything made wds so bearable i did my reasearch before wds and it paid off. I still use lyrica on bad days when nerve pains in my feet are killing me its like a miracle drug i only wish tolerance didnt build i would take it everyday for nerve pain, but then again when i went for more than a week or so everyday i would get a little gabba wd not too bad but definitely mental shit.

I been taking 600mg pregabalin for 3 years.

When i first took it 350mg would get me battered, mild hallucinations, amazing sense of well being, my friends would snort the 75mg capsules and sdaid it go them chilled, one friend took 150mg and said it got rid of his mephedrone comedown, one friend took 600mg with no tolerance as he needed to sleep it knocked him out he said 3hours later he felt pissed up and stoned. definitely recreational and heroin addicts love it as gets rid of rattle since they have no tolerance, it also makes methadone euphoric.

I took 900mg pregabalin and 7.5mg zopiclone and 5mg diazepam 10hours after 120mg morphine as I had none to last me till next morning the morphine.

I felt a nice high and chilled I smoked a spliff and was watching youtube videos bam  28hours later I wake up thinking its friday evening, the day said saturday madness. It was good though as I got to take my morphine all in one go and had some weed left hehe.

When i went thru opioid wds a little over 3 months ago i got lyrica for wds. I did around 450mgs lyrica the first day of wds i noticed the nerve pain in my feet was so much better on lyrica. I also had weed brownies i made for wds, the combo left me pretty wasted the first couple days of wds which was something i didnt expect during wds very pleasant!. Anyhow now i have plenty lyrica left as i dont do it more than 2 or 3 times a week only on my worse nerve pain days. I really dont wanna end up with another pill i need daily after over 20 years on oxy daily, but it helps so much with the nerve pain in my feet. Im wondering does the relief for nerve pain last if you stay at 150mgs a day longterm or do you constantly have to increase dose. Another thing that worries me is the weight gain is the weight gain substantial even staying at 150mgs daily. I read Wellbutrin can counter the weight gain anybody here do both together?.

I wish the FDA would approve this for anxiety.  Doctors here in America will just direct you to gabapentin but it is such an inefficient drug.


Anyone know if the approval for anxiety is in the works?  Lyrica would be an awesome long term anxiolytic compared to benzos.

The FDA doesn't just approve drugs. For lyrica to be approved for anxiety, Pfizer will have to be pony up for another round of clinical trials. However, a bill was recently signed into law that will make it easier for pharma companies to approve drugs for multiple indications, so it's highly likely that it will be eventually taken through phase III clinical trials for anxiety. That said, it doesn't need FDA approval to be prescribed, and most doctors know that it can be an effective anxiety medication. The main reason some doctors shy away from pregabalin is that it can be very expensive for patients.

^^ Agreed. It is expensive!! We met our $10,000 deductible in 2016 after my husband was diagnosed with cancer. He was prescribed lyrica for neuropathy that the chemo was causing. And he got one bottle filled. He hated the stuff (didn't agree with his neuro chemistry). But I loved the stuff. 


Gabapentin is much more affordable. But my god the amount you have to take is ridiculous. I know people that take over 3 grams of the stuff daily!

It all depends on the person but for me i dont think i can take enough gabapentin to feel like 300 or 450mgs of lyrica. Lyrica effects me different makes me happy a bit stumbly but really a nice buzz and great mood. I get some good effects from gabapentin but not all and lyrica seems so much dam stronger. Both do help with my nerve pain in my feet but again lyrica helps more.

I was prescribed Lyrica for siatica/back pain starting at 75 mg 2x daily then slowly up to 75 mg 6xdaily.  Doctor reduced oxy 50% and replaced with Lyrica and Tramadol.  The Lyica did nothing for pain.  If it had I would still be taking it regularly.  The high feeling side effects stop after a few weeks but it was the same with oxy for me.   I only gained 5 lbs. in 8 months on Lyrica, not everyone gains.  So I weaned off the Lyrica and down to splitting the 75 mg cap a day.   No real withdrawal problems except some nausea.

If Lyica reduces your pain consider yourself very lucky, you can take up to 600 mg a day every day.

The trams helped a bit with pain but they make me happy so those I take.

Unfortunately I would have to agree, it would be a week from hell. Sometimes I can work it so I have extra MSTs and Valium at start of a new script, to then help have a week off, as I also agree that's all it takes for the Lyrica to become more active again

I agree Lyrica works differently on everyone and I believe it to be much more effective for pain. anxiety and recreational use than gabapentin.

After 2 days of recreative dosage of pregabalin (300mg+300mg and 500mg+275mg) I got a strong headache. I thought it was not producing hangover, and the first day didn't. Suppose I might have overdo it a bit going 2 days in a row. Not my initial plan, but I couldn't stop myself from doing it. Both days it knock me out in the middle of the high.

All and all very interesting compound. I was expexting something in between phenibut and GHB and I wasn't dissapointed. I think it is something in between if more to the side of GHB. Anyway it has its own nature. Quite emphatic, though second day the magic was reduced tremendously. Music was clearly enhanced and I could get in the zone playing my instrument. My mental functions seemed unaltered and I could play chess with no problems at all, I was just maybe a bit more spaced out sometimes and slow but not worse. Main inconvenient was the loss of cordination which made activities like typing much more challenging than normaly.

I love Lyrica ! Been on 600mg daily for the last 2 years & it helps greatly with my severe GADm, if I miss a dose I feel dreadful though, withdrawal from such a high dose is not pretty so I'm dreading the time when I come off of it.

A friend, who as a medical professional keeps themselves well informed (One of the few that actually do) and will fill me in to certain bits of info they come across when it concerns a drug or therapy related to chronic pain or other shit I'm associated with and they say that there are ever increasing questions, queries and a self evident picture forming in Dr's offices regarding the failures of Lyrica and this is being reflected by such professionals publishing articles in the medical journals with respect to Lyrica doing very little for neuropathic pain.


I have consistent reports of my GP using it in place of benzos and he reckons he has some patients stabilised with regard to their anxiety conditions at Lyrica doses of 25-75mgs which is great imo.


Hell of a good drug to have on hand for opiate related withdrawal which made my switch from 500mgs per day of Oxycodone IR to suboxone. At 24hrs since my last dose ready to take my first sub strip I felt better than I had on other days with less time between Oxy doses.

Im tired of taking kpins /6mg daily for past 2 weeks) so Im getting lyrica from black market, witching to it, starting from 75mg, how long the anti-anxiety effect last from one dose? I can rise it up to 300mg daily, I have quite of lyrica so I can play with it. Also might take sometimes same recreational doses like 600mg, I heard that after one week break tehy work again like GHB on high doeses, am I right? Not that going to do it daily I need it for anxiety and mood stabilzation, so I need it to last.

Hey Neo,


That starting dose is wise Neo, I started at double that and it exacerbated my panic and anxiety which can happen but I was being given it for pain and back then I'd latch onto any drug that would ease pain.....it failed, as did every non-opioid drug until they also did. Take care Neo, I'm scripted 150 Ativan (lorazepam) every 6 weeks or 50 every 2 weeks and 100 Valium a month and every now and then throw in some Lyrica  or maybe a tiny bit of clonodine or a lot if me and Toto need to go bye-bye to Kansas.

Yeah, Ive experienced with lyrica before, 600mg gave me ghb like high. 300mg gave me speed like high, so I think something like 150mg would be sweet spot for work. Im going to use them not longer than 2 months, I dont think that would give any bad wds? I started new work and I always need something to calm me of because I always fear that I loose the job, but after 3 months, its unlikely they do it. So far ive worked very well on kpins even at 4mg. I hope lyricas will be good for that.

I have been experimenting a bit further with this substance one week ago just took 1 day 150mg on an empty stomach and it was lovely, very subtle high with colour enhancement and some euphoria for the first hours. When it kicked it gave me some kind of stimulant effect but without the anxiety. My cognitive abilities were unaltered and I could read quite normaly.

So here I am, 75 mg had no effect of any kind still anxious, so I took another one but ended up taking 300 all together (because it has very long come up and scared that 150 wont take my anxiety away so i doubled the dose). I must say that even 300 mg gave me moderate drunk walking and poor motor coordination (but not mentally any kind of high, that I was't even trying to get, just normal mental state, but I was less anxious around people). So took another 300mg after 4 hours, and after that I got relaxed feeling pretty socializing but not to the point like you can get from speed, just relaxed talking with people, nothing more, but it made my walking even worse. So while it did have anti-anxious properties it had nasty side-effect, the drunken walking, you can be like that in work, other people will think you are drunk. Maybe my starting doses were too high? Maybe I need to build up some tolerance and the poor motor coordination will go away?

I've never used Lyrica recreationally. My prescription is for spinal neuropathy. I can say though that the high/uphoria is very much like alcohol. I stumble my words, fall asleep, can't remember what happened, and wake up hungover. All exactly like alcohol, from 300 mg after not having used it for 3 or 4 days. Tolerance builds in a few days, and disappears just as fast.

It's great for sleep while in withdrawl from opiates or benzos.

For me 300mg Lyrica alone will get me awesome 8 hours sleep, no matter how bad I'm wd'ing from oxy(even better with 2mg Lorazepam!) I don't see it as much of a recreational drug, more like a great way to relax and sleep. Don't think you can use it on a Friday night and stay out late..... you'll be the guy at the party who falls asleep and gets a penis drawn on his forehead.

I don'g tet sleepy on pregabalin ,only when it comes to sleeping time normally, but otherwise if even if I take 900 mg pregabalin on the morning, I'm not sleepy even not a little bit whole day but as soon it hits the normal sleeping pattern, I fall sleep vey fast, thats very good thing as I have sleeping problems, at least I don't need to use sleeping pills then. I never get any kind of hungover from pregabalin, I usually still feel the effects of pregabalin for me its very long lasting, even with over 2g doses (totally useless I say, don't do it waste of time, let the tolerance go low) I don't get any hungover. For me the pregabalin high that you cant get once a week which gives me more like GHB like high, not alcohol type.


I'm going to over clonazepam 2-4mg daily (I have high tolerance) for 4 days until my tolerance to pregalin lowers, so it works better again. Right now testing 300mg x 3 daily with 2-4mg clomazepam for short time and right now it works ok, but thats bad idea if continuing it for over month, might get both WDs when quitting. I usually use anti-anxious drugs only 1 month when I start new stop after that I don't need them, usually having at least 6 month breaks from them, maybe taking recreational doses every now and then but thats it.


Need to say my mood has been very stable and good (not euphoric just the normal goof feeling) even from 200 mg pregabalin after using huge doses of it (one day I used up to 5g, total waste of expensive drug, don't try it even its it's safe by papers, you just don't get any "high" only getting really bad drunk walk and your're brain feels like they are smelting talking is very hard as you forget every day words), so I can't really understand how any one can abuse it, its not abusable drug in my opinion, so can't understand why doctors have problems to prescribe for someone because of so called "high abusable drug". It would be sme like doctor would refuse to prescript and anti-histamine for you, because some people get "high from it". Yes pregabalin is great for combos, especially for benzos and opioids, but I don't know about speed or other drugs tho'

I recently came across 7 boxes of Lyrica, 3 blisters in ea box at my home. My mum had some nerve endings in her spine burnt and was prescribed them. That was 2 years ago, and I don't think she ever found use for them. They're amazing for stimulant comedowns and insomnia. I've been snorting 500mg on the weekends for fun, but a month ago I found it is FANTASTIC for my Restless Leg Syndrome. From reading in this thread, Lyrica seems like a godsent as far as it's applications go. Anyway, i've noticed from this thread that it's somewhat addictive. Should I be worried about 75mg on weeknights for sleeping?

Cheers.

There's no reason to snort Lyrica. You should just take it orally imo

I think Lyrica really helps those with General anxiety and therefore may have a positive effect for those suffering from social anxiety issues. Don't give up after your first time which should be a dose anywhere from 25mgs to 150mgs depending on your weight. Give the drug at least two hours before you make any assessment of it at any dose. If you are new to it and you find you require more than 900mgs per dose before it serves you the way you wish it to or think it can then in my opinion you should try other drugs to reach the desired goal. Pfizer recommends Dr's and patients to not exceed 600mgs over a 24hr period thus it being the max dose clinically prescribed.


Sadly I think it sux for nerve pain and I am told by those in the profession that the evidence is stacking up on that side of things which Pfizer will be aware of as they would have been the ones doing the largest studies (hopefully)....the member RuntoParadise has touched on the above but I think much like suboxone and even methadone in the very opiate tolerant like myself (Can IV 100mcg of Fentanyl straight from the vial and feel nothing at all after 24 hrs since my last 45mg dose of Methadone) Lyrica can have the illusion of helping with chronic pain but that pain is often the pain that is caused by chronic opioid and opiate use and the peaks and troughs those regimes are known for.


It takes some real soul searching and honesty (made much easier once your tolerance makes it almost completely impossible to feel good or euphoric in any way) to admit that opiates make you feel better due to opiate withdrawal symptoms and not pain, one of the symptoms of opi WD and high doses being pain on top of your pain condition. So Lyrica which clearly "tidies up" opiate WD symptoms can easily be mistaken as the hero in reducing my pain (original condition).


Some folks who WD every month due to eating through their monthly opiate allowance in two weeks then spend the next two weeks in WD but they can operate and appear to not even have cold and flu symptoms a few days into such a WD as long as they have a warm blanket of Lyrica wrapped around them.


I remember when I transferred from Oxycodone and OxyContin to suboxone, I had to wait 24 hrs since my last Oxy dose and had resigned myself to a bad night before my first sub dose cos at the time I was completely useless @ the 12-15hr mark between oxy doses so 24hrs would have me punching /kicking walls from restless hands feet arms and legs not to mention some decent nausea to accompany the sneezes, tearing eyes and worst of all for me panic, anxiety and manic depression but loaded with Lyrica I still felt ok which then had me worrying that I wasn't sick enough to avoid a precip WD from the suboxone.....Lyrica is great at managing those WD symptoms cos I took my first 2mg strip, waited 30mins then took another 2mg strip and about 30mins later I felt a tingle crawl over my skin - I had officially replaced full ag opies with a partial ag suboxone due to its incredible affinity for the receptors that needed attention......amazing.


But Lyrica is the equal star of that show truly amazing. Just did fuck all for any pain not related to my opiate use. And yes Lyrica does have it's own set of physical WD symptoms ..... another lie started by Pfizer and parroted by many GP's.

Just snorted 300 mg pregabalin and it works! Comeup in 15min pretty euphoric even. Doesnt matter what other people say, if it doesnt work or placebo whatever. It works, maybe wastign it little bit but doesnt matter if you have tons of it. Lots of filler yes so not so good for lungs. But yeah I think I start my dya with 300 mg snorted and then few hourws later taking 300mg orally. at least this way it works almost instantly and has stronger effect (all hits the same time, instead of depot like effect what you get from eating, especially if you take it after eating.

Anybody taking Lyrica should first Google the withdrawal symptoms. Some people have none, but a small percentage have miserable, life-altering wd's after only a few weeks use. I have personally experienced wd's after only a few days use. I have to taper off slowly or I get bad insomnia.

Never experienced from 1 week use when used the for stopping opioid use, but now I have used 2 weeks high doses (1g daily) and tomorrow I run out of them, we will see, if there is any wds I have clonazepam. But lets hope the best. I might get prescript for lyrica 300mg x3 daily because its only medicine that lifts my mood and take my anxiety away, ssris are worse, abusign is no problem, because you can really abuse them after few days you just dont get that ghb feel anymore, need at least 1 week break.

Well today didn't take pregabalin anymore (only 75mg left, better save it for better use), I took iuusually 1g per day for 2 weeks, and I feel depressed and little bit like opioid WD's, also I stopped taking clonazepam 2-8mg daily (did for two weeks). Well maybe thye both cause shit feeling, I took some opium and I still can feel the sweeting, I was already thinking that my inregular chipping of opiopids caused this, but seems I was wrong. Well lets hope this dont give me opium wds, lol then Im fucked and need to get GHB or phenibut.

Yes thanks. I think its clonazepam. I never have had wds from even one month daily lyrica use. I don't really enjoy benzos after a while, I still have big bottle of clonazepam laying there, I'll keep them for some real reason (anxiety) if I ever need them, I hope not, I ask doctor if he can prescript me lyricas 150x3 daily for few months, they seems to be great anti-depressants too, and also maybe after this opium binge I need them.

I went from 600mg/day to 500mg a week ago. Felt aches all over my body, RLS, mood swings. Not good and worried for my sanity I stopped that 500 cold turkey on Sunday and all the withdrawal symptoms are going fast with NO psychological residue. 


What is this stuff?!?


(It's great too. 600-900mg is going to be my booze replacement once at homeostasis)

My doctor gave this for anxiety and as antidepressant 150mgx2 day, if not working then 3 days, this forum is not good place to ask good experience because its mostly some sob story.  This is much better place to check if some medication is good:

[https://www.drugs.com/comments/pregabalin/for-generalized-anxiety-disorder.html](https://www.drugs.com/comments/pregabalin/for-generalized-anxiety-disorder.html)


But I much say it works great.

^ I read the link. There are huge varieties in experience with this drug.  If you dont get much out of BL then maybe you are best off elsewhere. 


I got prescribed this for a busted disc in my back and had never heard of it being used for anything but nerve pain.

In here they give to to anxiety too, I told I don't want to eat benzos and not  single antidepressant works (tried all that they give here), 600mg pregabalin daily takes my anxiety away completely and gives me normal mood, I can socialize with people normally go where I want not feeling any anxiety, it's good medicine for anxiety, and in the link there are people who have been on it 300x3 daily for years and it still works. Don't get me wrong I like bluelight, but it's like we are all here badly addicted to everything and we need harm reduction and so on. Is there any more laid back drug forum?

I'm on day 7 now. It hasn't been the best ride and I've done a lot of thinking. I've been more or less constantly in a horrible state of flux this whole time. Sometimes it lets up and I get so happy I cry, other times I feel dead. It's more anxiety than depression and on the whole it does seem to be getting better. 


I need to talk to my doc about this. It's as if, all of a sudden some months ago, it stopped working for me. Pains returned, I got the runs, I started to worry again. That's when I thought I should come off it but didn't do. 


So when I did go cold turkey it's as if the majority of the utter scary and shit part was skipped.

Who have driven with this stuff? Even with therapeutic doses 300mg it will get you're moving like booze drunk, will this go away in a time when Im using it longer? Many times ive walked to my car and people might look that I'm fucking wasted, I mean I ate vclonazepam 2 days ago maybe it will so in piss test if polic will stop me.


I've driven on next substances without any problems:

Cannnabis (drive very carefully), amphetamines (drive very good, I see every people and sign, it makes me more focused on driving, not making any mistakes), lyrica on high doses (needs to be careful), GBL (well need to be careful), high doses of benzos (like lyricas), opioids (totally normal if good dose, if stupid useless nodding dose than I had very hard time to keep my eyes open, never been so scared while driving). But I've never driven drunk on alcohol, that crosses my line.

Ne0- driving impaired is always a bad plan. I used to be the best drunk driver on the planet, but if I had ever been in a crash they would have blamed it on the booze and sent me straight to jail. If it makes you feel different and you think other people can tell you're high, then definitely don't drive.

I don't mean to sound preachy( I drive every day now on oxy),but it's all really a bad idea.

I mean my doctor prescripted to take 300mg once a day and it makes me walk like drunk person little bit but i can still drive normally, is it ok? what would police say ? Everything is legal.I hope my clonazepam dposent show there I have prescripted other benzor befor but not clonazepam.


btw. I drove car every day on opium for 3 years, no problems at all I drove very good, even if polise make piss test I can say I took codeine based cough syrup which is OTC here, that gives positive for codeine and morphine just like opium heh.


While I'm sober I drive like crazy person, at least my wife said so.

I even feel strange if I jus take 400 as sometimes take 600 in one go and then one in evenimg.  I do get a mild buzz off it since taking opiates it doesn't affect Me in a high way. all my friends love pregabs tho slays asking me for em and very popular in prisons


there very strong I never get restless legs if Going through mild withdrawal when I only had 2oo Sunday instead of 600 Monday morning I was dry heaving felt weird until I took 400 with 40mg morpgine orally and got a slight nod and fell asleep mainly pregab effects though. . your tolerance drops quick to this drug bt soon goes back up imo

Neo- Driving under the influence is just that- you can go to jail if you're high on chocolate. The police can't arrest you for using drugs at home if they're otc, but they will take you to jail for driving impaired regardless of what you ingested. It doesn't matter if it's alcohol, prescribed, cough syrup, or diet coke.

Hello

I tried lyrica first when my doctor gave it to me for social anxiety. At first i took 150 mg twice a day. It was incredible i felt so good and didnt have any problem socializing. But later i used them recreationally at weekends. I took about 300-450 mg. Then i decided to use them only on weekends so i stopped my reguler doses and took 300-450 only on weekends. It was great but then i began to take it on week days too. A year later abusing the drug. now i take more than 1 gm daily for about a month  and I   Dont get the euphoric effect from it. So I decided to taper down the drug after my finals because i can't concentrate without it. So i want to taper down for two weeks by using 600 mg daily for 4 days. Then 450 for 4 days also.then 300 for 2 days. Then 150 for 5 days. so what do u think guys? Did anyone tried to quit it after a year of abuse? And will i get my tolerance back after quitting the drug and how long will it take to go to zero tolerance? Btw i don't take anything else and im afraid of the withdrawal symptoms. Need opinions on how to taper down without getting withdrawal symptoms?!

Does nicotine work very strong on you when you are on prgabalin? Its like very strong effect that I get from smoking cigarettes. They say that pregabalin lessens the craving of smoking, but it feels really great when I smoke.

L6- your taper plan seems solid. Spread your doses across the day evenly. Maybe every 8 hours1/3 daily dose. If you have any headaches or nausea, you may need a higher dose/longer taper. Make sure your life can handle 2 or 3 days to adjust to the first tapered dosage in case you feel crappy.

Also be ready to continue tapering beyond 150mg/day. That was my max dose and I had to go to 100, 75, 50 and then 25 for 4 days each or I got BAD insomnia.

Ya, I got bad insomnia and some kind of depression after taking recreational doses of lyrica most days for just over a month. From 150mg to 900mg dosages, around 15g in total. Not really a withdrawal but not normal either. It took 5 days to feel as usual. A single dose of opium was quite useful during that time.

For what I read it can change a lot from person to person. Some people don't get withdrawal at all, even on high dosages. I had enough product to taper down but to be honest trying to control dosage was looking more difficult that just go cold turkey. Especially as I was not getting much euphoria anymore.

Well I have script for many benzos and lyrica, so I have premission to ingest hem and then drive, dosent matter what doses, tho mixing lyrica with benzos gives you really bad drunk walk. I wouldn't drive then, even that I have permission to do it.

Ah I see, I use it usually only one week doses 600-1600mg (because of tolerance building up very quick) and I feel normal mostly. Its interesting that pregabalin have so rapid tolerance build up, when other gaba drugs like GBL has very slow tolerance build up, it didnt rise even when using 2 weeks 24/7, or when used every weekend 1-3 days in 6 month period. I like GBL most of the the gaba drugs, then pregabalin for sure, it has some kind of same feeling as do GHB/GBL have.


Another interesting thing is that both gbl and pregabalin takes opioid WD's compltely away, after quitting 3 years of daily opium shot of gbl or pregablin took everything away, no WD's at all. If I'm using opioids now time to time  I must have pregabalin for later use because it gives hungover for 4 days that reminds WDs little bit, mostly sweeting hot/cold and insomnia.


And I really like nicotine and caffeine while on pregabalin, it feels very strong, I mostly use snuss. But on othjerhand on GBL I dont like nicotine at all.

I had a horrendous experience w/ lyrica. I got hyper-sexual, but not w/ my husband. I ended up having an online graphic video sharing affair! Then, after missing 2 doses, I realized how f'd up I had been. I stopped taking it the next day. (I also had horrible pitting edema, and overall edema, and was on 750/mg a day)


This was 12 years ago, and my marriage is still on a rocky road because of it. 


Then when we moved to where we are now, at the pain clinic, I was talking to some of the other patients who had been on lyrica, and they had the same hyper-sexuality! I spoke to a few pharmacy friends, & they had heard  the same thing from other patients. 


So, anyone else here have a similar reaction?

This drug gives pretty strong cravings it seems. feeling shit today took only 150mg but I get 2100mg in one hour, so I might take 1500mg on more time then there is so little left that I take only 300 mg for two days and then Im off lets hope it helps. But not sure because I took poppytea 4day binges two times in two weeks, and I got WDs from it so maybe its only opioid WD that pregabalin takes away totally, really hard to tell. It surely feels like mild opioid WD. But I don't think one week of pregabalin using doses 800-1500 mg should give anything like that, I need to start work next week if I'm still not ok and as there is no any pregabalin left on my prescript, so I hope I don't have to go back to poppy tea  as there isn't anything else to help feeling better (I can get different benzos but they are useless), I can't think quitting poppy second time.

Yep, cravings are definitely an issue with this one. Really moreish. Psychologically it is quite addictive. Physically seems to be alright especially for those of us who are used to opiates or benzos. The effect is quite weird, sometimes close to drunk sometimes close to a stimulant minus anxiety. The effects on my concentration are really good, at the stimulant level plus a dose of space out. I keep improving my rating in chess whenever I am under the influence, but fast games are a no go, as I get quite stuck now and then. For me there is not question, it is doping.

I can keep at an intellectual activity for really long lengths of time without feeling mentally tired.


I as well noticed very dry skin mainly in face and scalp during my binges. Urine comes really dark so I think you should drink a lot with this one.


Yesterday I had a 300mg+150mg dose and after 9 days without using tolerance is almost completely reset. I quite like the high tolerance as I find it self-regulating, poor as I am. It is annoying when you are trying to get there and you can´t manage, but it is for the best really. Prefer to pay that little price earlier than a bigger bill later.


By the way, I don't feel much hypersexuality at all. Opposite to GHB which is the horniest thing I have ever tried. Alcohol doesn't seem to make me horny either. A bit less selective maybe but not hornier.


I lost all interest in alcohol since I tried pregabalin. I haven't drunk alone since then.

I never liked alcohol or benzos that much, but GBL is really my favorite evene more than opium, also pregabalin is great when you have rested the tolerance and take 300-600mg at once, really great feeling.


Also don't take any benzos with pregablin, in my experience it ruins the effect, it makes you really fucked up in not nice way. I took 5mg clonazepam with 1500mg prebalin, I cant feel any pregablin effects (tho' I have high tolerance) I feel like drunk without good feelings, damn just wasted 1500mg pregabalin.

We have the same brain chemistry. Never understood people taking benzos recreative. I just take them as a sleeping aid very occasionaly. And alcohol, well sometimes it does the job, but most times it is just a numbness without much interesting anything going on. As a way to change conciousness it is clearly overated IMO. But I kind of love single malts and some expensive beers. 


I used to love GHB, took a lot of it and never gave me any adiction or inconveniences..., well I passed out a couple of times because of redosing. Then it started giving me worrying stomach pains. Had to end up throwing it away, nobody wanted it. I know it is a very difficult to dose drug and you cannot mix with alcohol, but I never understood it was not more popular. It is DESHINIBITION with capital letters. Never ordered again. That was 10 years ago. So ya, sometimes I miss it. Problem is the minimum purchase it is far too much. And if I get the pain again it would be worthless. One day we will cross paths, I'll wait patiently.


And opium, well he is second to nothing. He is the king wiping out suffering and producing PLEASURE. He doesn't threat me as he used to as I knocked to much in his door. But he didn't spank me really bad for that to be honest, I am one of the lucky ones who got away quite easily. But still he is for me like a good old lover.

I do use benzos for recreationally occasionally, because sometimes they do give some kind of gaba pleasure, the sedation and relaxed feeling, but other times it make me feel crappy. It depends on benzo, etziolam in my experience gives even euphoric feeling and very nice gaba relaxation. Yes for me too alcohol sometimes gives even GHB like high for a short time, especially when drinking high quality vodka, but very rarely. Sometimes even one beer gives nice relaxation, but most times it makes me feel not good, like bad unclean high of benzos. 


Opium is only opioid I ever have liked along with kratom, I've tried oxycodone and fentanyl and 10 other differnet opioids (never heroin I don't try it even if offered money), they weren't for me, but oh the nice poppy, that was my daily companion for three years, had to quit eventually it started to cost too much and I got very bad migraine headache for 2 days every now and then from it. I still use it time to time, but then I need pregablin to take 5 day mild wd hungover away. But I really miss kratom, I haven't done it for over 10 years, because its very hard to get in here, well maybe next time when I go to SE-Asia I find someone who has it.


Last year I found that GBL gave me even greater pleasure than ever before (I had 6 years break from it because of availability), even better than first time very very euphoric high much better than what you get from speed. I really like it, but there is no GBL available to buy in my local market, so I haven used it for a long time, I still try to find some 20ml GBL just for few day use and enjoy it all over again.

Interesting me pregabalin makes first stimulated but after that sedated, it varies, sometimes the effect is different than normally, one time it even felt like opioid high, all depends on tolerance too ofc, it's interesting drug.

Does pregabalin have crosstolerance with gabapentin? because I just took 3500g gabapentin and don't feel much, maybe little warm on my feets, I had 1500mg daily binge with pregabalin, maybe thats the reason? Or did I got scammed (bough from street).

Ya, it does have crosstolerance. Actually with all gabaergics and probably with gabapentin the most as they are both gabapentinoids and have similar mechanism of action and effects.

Ok I see I took 4 hours ago 3600mg gabapentin every 1 hour 800mg with fat meal, and then I took 300 mg pregabalin 1 hour ago I ytet can't feel much, but let's hope this combo gives me something. I got shit loads of methylpphenidate, so I took 56mg depot (I always prefer depot drugs, because of more smooth effects), I hope it plays all well. I report back.

Neo- I'm not trying to judge, but it doesn't matter if your meds are prescribed. Driving under the influence is illegal. Ask any police officer- if you're impaired and it's because of anything your Dr prescribed, it's the same as driving drunk. I do it every day, but it is against the law. People get DUI's on Listerene(mouthwash). You can get a DUI on cough syrup, while riding a bicycle. It's a little stupid if you ask me, but it is the law and cops LOVE to give DUI's.

If you get pulled ovet DO NOT admit to having taken any pills. There's no law against being a bad driver. Just take your ticket and go home. If you tell the cop that you're on anything, his story will suddenly change and you will have been swerving and slurring your words.

About the gabaergics cross tolerance...Yesterday I drank a bit of alcohol, it had been quite long since I have drunk so the effect was quite strong though I just drank one beer, one glass of wine and one shot of spirit. Well 3 hours after that I tried to get a bit high with pregabalin and it was useless. I took double the dose of the day before (750mg) and didn't feel it much. Just tolerance from one day 300mg, it seems it doesn't work after drinking.

Today I went for 1 gram of Phenibut and I felt the effect as usual, didn't perceive any tolerance. It seems cross tolerance between pregabalin and Phenibut is not very acute.


It is quite strange I would have guessed that pregabalin would have more cross tolerance with Phenibut than alcohol based on the nature of the effect.

Fuck got bad WD's from 1 month heavy daily pregabalin use, I now jumped back to opioids, I much rather quit opioids than pregabalin, at least I can use then GHB, but with this shitty pregablin bullshit, I think it wouldnt work.

I apologize as I did not read the entire thread but I know there have been some questions on OD safety.

Pregabalin

Lethal dosage

Both rat and mouse oral acute LD50 have been established to be greater than 5000mg/kg. Rat IV LD50 was also determined to be greater than 300mg/kg.[15]

In terms of humans, there exists a case report of a man who ingested 8,400mg pregabalin and eventually fell into a coma but was managed with supportive care alone until he regained consciousness.[16] For comparison, the maximum recommended a therapeutic dose of pregabalin is 300mg twice per day. Another case report details a man's suicide attempt with the co-ingestion of an estimated 11.5 grams of pregabalin and 32 grams of lamotrigine, another anti-epileptic agent which, by blocking sodium channels, lowers glutamate levels similar to pregabalin. He presented with a reduced level of consciousness and an aggressive demeanor when not sedated. Eventually, he suffered respiratory problems that required intubation and ventilation. After 28 days in the hospital (19 of which were in the intensive care unit) the man was discharged from the hospital. The man suffered seizures which were attributed to his underlying epilepsy.[17] Pfizer's official package insert for Lyrica states that the highest accidental ingestion of pregabalin during clinical trials was 8 g, with no significant consequences.[18]

How are you doing? hope you are fine by now.

It would be interesting if you can describe whatever withdrawal symptoms you got and how they compared to an opioids withdrawal.

But not sure because I took poppytea 4day binges two times in two weeks, and I got WDs from it so maybe its only opioid WD that pregabalin takes away totally, really hard to tell. It surely feels like mild opioid WD. But I don't think one week of pregabalin using doses 800-1500 mg should give anything like that, I need to start work next week if I'm still not ok and as there is no any pregabalin left on my prescript, so I hope I don't have to go back to poppy tea  as there isn't anything else to help feeling better (I can get different benzos but they are useless), I can't think quitting poppy second time.

Here is an example of what not to do. This thread is for the discussion of dosages, effects, withdrawal, etc, not hose sizing.


Since this thread is old enough, a version 3.0 will be coming soon.


Stick to the point. Practice phrasing.


Some people have "more than normally prescribed" dosages. If you are one of them, please phrase correctly. 


Abuse will not be tolerated.

With all my respect, I might not have understood well your ''phrasing'' so correct me if I am wrong. Things like hose sizing not even google understand them...


Are you saying that people abusing the drug are not welcome to share their experiences?

It seems there is a difference between sharing experiences and bragging about self destructive behavior. 

Also, though I am sure I too am guilty of getting off-topic, this thread should be limited to Lyrica/Pregabalin. Neo's comments do have a place at Bluelight but that place seems more appropriate somewhere in the 'Dark Side'.

^Ooh, SK, harsh. Lol. Never see you on the pain threads any more. Hope that's bcos ur doing well?.


^^Neo, it's a little confusing when you say what may be wd symptoms from pregabalin are worse than opi wds,- then go on to post that you'd not bear to think of quitting poppy tea again.


Lyrica is excellent at covering opiate wd symptoms, I have previously posted many times how I've bridged between script.


Perhaps try to keep your binges of whatever substance to the lowest dose that works for you, & take a day or two off every now & then.


Hope you're feeling alright now. As an above poster asked, could you compare & describe the wd symptoms you're experiencing with lyrica to pod tea? Or are you unsure of what one you're  actually wding from?

In the new thread then you can draw some nice lines nobody can cross then. Good luck with that one. There is a huge difference between bragging and abusing IMO. I myself don't use pregabalin as prescripted, have my reasons for it and I am quite sure I am not bragging. That a drug is a prescription drug doesn't invalidate it as a recreative one. Or make that use wrong by itself.

Hey everyone.


Some quick background material. I am an recovering addict - I am on 60 mg methadone and 2 mg clonazepam daily.


Together with my addiction I am suffering from epilepsy and a variety of psychological disorders including anxiety.


My job requires a lot of international travel, and traveling is connected with severe anxiety for me due to some bad experiences earlier in my life. Last time I was traveling I got so wound up before leaving home that I turned back to some old addictive behaviors. Together with my normal dosage of methadone I took 240 mg oxycodone (2x120 mg OxyContin). It took me several weeks before I stopped this and got back to taking methadone only. It was mainly my anxiety for the upcoming traveling that triggered my "down fall". 


Normally the clonazepam should handle the anxiety. But it starts to seem like this isn't enough anymore. I am experiencing small cases of panic attacks again as well. I would like to avoid increasing my dosage of clonazepam. 


I discovered that pregabalin have been approved for anxiety treatment now. Hence, my questions:


Do anyone have experience with the use of pregabalin for anxiety - maybe in combination with a benzodiapine?


I have tried pregabalin before - to see if it have any recreational value - and it absolutely have no effects in that regard whatsoever for me, therefore I am not that afraid of adding pregabalin to the mix in regards of psychological addiction. I do not know if pregabalin have any psyhical withdraval symptoms however or if it is hard to stop taking after a longer period of prescribed use?


The alternative to pregabalin every day would be some alprazolam in the days I am traveling, but as an addict I know that is one of the most dangerous benzodiazepines to add into the mix and I could see myself ending up needing a dose of that everyday as well. I will have to address the travel matter in therapy obvisoly. I cannot avoid it and it will continue to be part of my job. However, this is not exactly a quick fix.

Yeah, I get it weekly and usually blow through my 2100mg in 3 days and have to go 4 days without or use phenibut.

I think you should give it a try. It definitely works for some people for anxiety. It can cause dependence, but if you follow your prescribed dosages and tapper at the end of the cycle you should be alright. It affects different people in very different ways, so some people report no withdrawal meanwhile others complain about bad depressive states especially. Psyquiatrists always recommend taking it daily, but if your anxiety is situacional, you might take it only when you travel and maybe avoid addiction. Take that with a pinch of salt...maybe just follow your psyquiatrist advice...but still think peoople with no risk of abuse could benefit by incidental use.


It definitely has recreative value so be careful in that department. Lots of people take big doses, far higher than their prescription and are left with nothing for the rest of the period.


IMO is preferable to benzo usage, more functional, better mood enhancer and much less risky. It is quite usual to have prescribed both. Pregabalin during the day and benzo for sleep.

Thanks for your reply. Even with my benzo dosage I will get seizures if I take large dosages of pregabalin (I learned this the hard way), so I can't get near the dosages required to feel the recreational effects..


I get seriously physical withdrawal effects from tramadol (especially it becomes impossible for me to sleep due to severe restless leg syndrome) and I become very depressed. I have experienced pregabalin doing the same with restless leg syndrome. Therefore I fear I might be one of those who will suffer severe withdrawal from pregabalin. The good thing with me being so sensitive to tramadol is that oxycodone and morphine does not give me so severe withdrawal syndroms as soon as I am past the typical physical symptoms like puking etc.


Anyway, as I have it currently I am willing to try pregabalin. I still have to tapper out of methadone and maybe clonazepam one day plus I get low dose Quetiapin to sleep so adding one more to the mix seems to see like a small thing - But I recon that is the addict constantly sitting on my shoulder leading me to believe this ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


(And sometimes I think that - realistically - I am never going to be able to tapper out of either methadone nor clonazepam)

I'm quite skeptical of Lyrica (and Gabapentin, which has been shown to be no inferior than Lyrica. Pfizer's Gabapentin patent expired. Watch, once Lyrica's does, a Lyrica XR will come out!) but anyway I'm not a big fan of it. It hasn't really been shown to be all that effective in nerve pain, Gabapentin was sold off-label as an Epilepsy med, an anxiety med, etc, and docs use both Gabapentin and Lyrica still off-label for anxiety when flawed studies have concluded it's better than Bromazepam, a weak benzo anyway! 


Anyway I have lots of nerve damage and have been on very high doses of both (though I finally just stuck to Gabapentin but since we are speaking of Lyrica) The only thing Lyrica has done for me that I like is getting rid of hot flashes due to my opioids. I have major nerve damage in my right foot, to where I can't feel half and the other half is burning on fire, I've got Sciatica, and definitely nerve pain from the bottom of my right thigh and all the way down. 


Lyrica never helped. I think it's overprescribed and I think a lot of people should try tapering and they'd be shocked at how it doesn't help! For RLS and hot flashes, yes, for DIABETIC nerve pain, slightly, but that's it! 


I've abused it before and the feeling was weird... in fact, I couldn't even talk properly. I slurred like crazy. Was a little high but remembered everything. 


Oh and another thing... it has w/d symptoms after prolonged use that are similar to benzo withdrawals. Right now a lot of docs are trying to prescribe lyrica instead of benzos for its "anxiety relief" (yeah, temporary) but right now it's just loved by docs. One day these folks who have been on it for years will suffer horrible withdrawals and we will see what a mistake we made in over glorifying it! 


If you've been Rxed Lyrica for over a year, has your dose gone up? Because with me, they'd ask "how is the Lyrica" and I'd say "not doing a thing" and they'd raise it every time. Sorry but if it has to be raised all the time perhaps it just isn't working! 


I know, my post is all over the place. Sorry! Lol

Ignio- background on me- I have high functioning Autism and I have meltdowns that are very much like a panic attach. They are very debilitating and last  from 30 minutes to several hours. I used alcohol only for many years and it worked well. But now I'm on Ativan(a benzo) and I don't drink at all.

I called my doctor, and he thought that pregabalin might help with my anxiety as well. So he wrote me a script. I will start at 150 mg pregabalin each day.


I look forward to see (or rather feel) the effects. If it helps I will probably increase the dosage until I find the sweet spot where I get the maximum output and minimal side effects. But based on the posts here it seems like 300 mg will be the max dose. I can't go around sleepy and drowsy the entire day with blurred speach et cetera. So I will have to be careful with the dose. My goal is not a zombie state, but getting better through situation that trigger anxiety and thus have a better day with more energy as I do not have to spend tremendous amounts of energy dealing with or trying to avoid anxiety.


Anxiety is a feeling that is extremely hard for me to deal with and actually also understand. I would prefer fear of something real any day instead of this anxiety about abstractions. I have lived through and handled alot and never felt more than what I would all healthy fear in life threatning situation etc. But almost out of no where, anxiety came creaping in through the shadows leaving one with a feeling similar to that kids would feel at night when they fear there is a monster lurking in the shadows just out of sight. Monster, Monster, go away.

Ignio- whatever you choose, try to make your goal be taking as few different kinds of meds as possible. They all have side effects, and blasting your brain with too many chemicals can be disastrous. If Lyrica works, then see if it could be all you need. The magic number seems to be somewhere around 14 days. That's when you can be sure of the long term benefits of what you're taking.

Also, beware of Lyrica withdrawls. I have needed to taper after only 3 days use.

Back after a month, lol. 


I called my doc and had them cancel my pregabalin repeats but I still had loads left over, intending to have them as an occasional pick me up. I had a few days of bad pain but I also had to get some chores done for my parents (renovating their house for them). I just had NO ENERGY for days and thought some lyrica might help. I took my old max dose for a couple of days on the run, then spent 2 weeks having it most days. I only took my last dose on Monday (1/3 usual dose on Sun and mon). Anywho. Those same days I had no energy again. I was a fucking mess. Nothing got done, plus I was really anxious and depressed. Not like an opiate withdrawal again but something else entirely.


last night I had the worst night sleep of my life. Just as I was falling asleep I was beset with deep anxiety and had a few night terrors that woke me up. Dreadful. I'm having cold water extractions to try and punch it away but they're not working. I feel OKAY (not good or great) for maybe an hour.  This is worse than when I came off the longer and more consistent dose of 600mg for 6 months!


i burned through my last ones during this period so that's it for me. Its such a weird drug.

Flowerpotmsn- why cancel your script? I'm sure I'd find a way to f it up, but I would get them filled and try to save myself the pain if cold turkey- taper down and save the leftovers.

A show of good faith as I was trying to get a stronger opiate script. But as it now stands (once i finish withdrawing) I'm gonna taper and quit the lot.

I did that, show of good faith. If I remember correctly it got me cut off one and cut back on the one I wanted more of. Kind of backfired.

But then I had another surgery and it was open season again!

The biggest mistake I ever made was quitting oxy cold turkey and TELLING my Dr. When I had been clean for a month and was begging for pain relief, she gave me 3 norcos/day. That was like a screen door on a submarine.

Now I know..... Regardless of what I'm taking, I always ask for more. My stash has bailed me out several times in the last two years, specifically when my surgeon gave me practically nothing for pain and I had to wait 5 days to see a real Dr for real pills. Never again.

My current plan is to get off everything, but I'm not telling my Dr anything until way later.

I think ultimately it worked for me. Because really I don't want anything stronger than codeine, I'm already having 2-3x my prescribed daily dose just trying to combat the anxiety and depression from this lyrica withdrawal. My docs has a few of them and this time I landed on the tougher one.


but yeah. This is like day 5 now of the withdrawal. I don't actually know for sure what I'm withdrawing from. I was taking (too much) tramadol and (right amount of) lyrica when I stopped both and switched just to codeine and a standard anti depressant. What hit me could have been either tramadol or lyrica... or maybe even both!


its (because it's still here) a feeling of huge anxiety. I'm having nightmares and I'm sweating. There's some depression too. I don't have the energy to do anything, and everything feels like an insurmountable task... I'm not even eating correctly because of it. But it's getting better. CWE helps.


but I'm sure never to have lyrica again, hah. I've actually only got enough for one days worth of max dose left. Dunno if it's worth risking it and saving it for a rainy day.

Squeaky, how long does withdrawal usually take you? I can't put an exact number of how many days I've been using it for, maybe 7 and I'm now day 5 into WDS ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png) funnily enough taking a similar time to last time when I used for months.

Flowerpotman- I've never let the lyrica wd last more than two days. I always had a lot of reserve, so I just went back on it and tapered.

It sounds like your wd's are a lot of the tramadol, spirinkled with the Lyrica wd. If that's true, then you should start getting bettet right about now-day 4 being the peak of opiate wd's.

Yeah its hard to work out since I find Lyrica WDS similar to opiates but less intense, but deeper+weirder+more depression and anxiety. I'm only taking codeine when I feel really down and each day I'm less and less down.

Holy crap Flowerpotman! That's quite a jump you made there. You're probably WDing from both the Lyrica and tramadol. I've gone through WD from both, but never at the same time. Plus it's common to experience depression when switching to a new antidepressant. May I ask which one you started? An SNRI would probably help you more than an SSRI. 


IME tramadol WD caused worse depression and anxiety than lyrica WD. For me, acute WD from both lasted between a few days and a week, and PAWS lasted about a few more weeks. Once you adjust to the new antidepressant though, it should help a ton with the tram PAWS.

Yeah after speaking with you all I've come to realise this is probably due to the tramadol. What seems to happen with me is that Lyrica WD completely eradicates opiate highs so there's no CWE for when everything gets too much. But now nearly 2 weeks from stopping Lyrica I'm getting the highs again but there's still the persistent depression+anxiety that is slowly slowly fading. I went to my docs trying to get an SNRI explaining all this, including the severe mood swings and suicidal thoughts. But he told me to ride it out a bit longer and prescribed my usual SSRI. That should almost be kicking in soon anyways.


Oh hey so because my lyrica usage was only 7 months, and opiates maybe 8... I shouldn't get long PAWS, right? I mean last year when I went CT from Tram+Codeine it lasted maybe 2 weeks before I was working again. Just a bit worried this time.

It's really hard to say how long your WD will last. PAWS can be especially variable. If your SSRI works for you, I would bet that your PAWS from both will be pretty much over whenever it starts working. I had crippling anxiety from tram WD during the acute phase, but not the post-acute period. The depression from both Lyrica and tram WD was the longest lingering symptom for me. As difficult as it might be, forcing yourself to do some physical activity can help a ton with beating PAWS and starting to feel normal again. 


Sorry if I missed it in a previous post, but what were you trying to treat with these drugs?

After years of 450mg a day, the withdrawal was worse and longer than I expected, and I even had gabapentin to ease the comedown. It wasn't until

the gabapentin was increased to 1800/day a week after stopping the lyrica that I finally found some stability. I'm not sure how much switching to gabapentin has helped my game, sure its generic and not a controlled substamce, but the physical dependence on it isn't too far from lyrica's chains. 

Still, better for me than any opioid, to treat nerve pain.

Any reason in particular why you decided to switch from pregabalin to gabapentin?

I certainly had fewer side effects with gabapentin than pregabalin. Personally, when I'm not particularly tolerant that is, I prefer gabapentin across the board.

I'm not sure I ever became entirely dependent. I definitely developed a tolerance, but over the nine months or so I was taking pregabain (I think 150mg three times a day) I never seemed to develop a dependency. 


It's different for everyone, but pregabalin and gabapentin are fairly easy to manage. Even though there is the occasional person who struggles getting off most are able to manage without much issue.

Numbered01- It sounds like you're not exactly looking to give up Lyrica.  How long does a dose like 3000 mg last for you, and how long is the hangover when it's done?

Shit I got over the hangover just today. Last night is was still feeling it. I had double vison and shit. Yeah 3000mg is alot to pop at once and I dont recommend any newbie to do that cause that is just way to much. Plus I did it with Oxycodone and Klonapin.

I have been getting a lot of double vision in the afternoon. Your comment just made me realize that it's probably from the Lyrica. I am down to one 150 mg dose around noon, and I take oxy all day long. I thought my double vision was from the oxy but maybe it's from the Lyrica. It only happens when I am sitting around, goes away when I am moving(walking, driving, etc).

I recently begun lyrica 100mg TID for fibromyalgia. I am taking it in therapeutic doses. 


I've noticed some feelings of stimulation, mild energy boost, and a sort of cognitive enhancement. 


Has anyone else experienced something similar? 


Gabapentin in staggered doses up to 1500mg has me very intoxicated feeling, sedated and lack of motor coordination. I don't seem to experience that type of effect from lyrica. 


Thoughts?

A follow up on my earlier posts where I was considering getting a prescription for pregabalin against anxiety.


I take 225 mg pregabalin each morning and 225 mg later in the day. In the first few days I was feeling very good, almost euphoric, relaxed and very focused. After this the effects became less noticable but I have had less anxiety and no panic attacks at all. As such it is working very well together with my clonazepam.

Now I am starting to look for side effects to determine whether it is something for long term use. 


I am going to stop taking my pregabalin for a day or two to see how I react. It is probably not the best course of action for the stability of my overall medication, but I need to see how my body response without it.

So here's a funny thing. It was about 2.5 weeks after stopping lyrica and switching tramadol for codeine and I was getting back to normal. But 3 days ago I took 100mg of lyrica to push me through some intense work I had to do, 2 days ago I took another 100mg. Yesterday I had none and felt bad in the evening. This morning I felt dreadful so I've taken another 100 today. I've only got one 100mg left so if I still feel shitty I'll have that in 2 days.


I think if any of yous have come off lyrica and still keep some around… don't take it for more than a day. I'm still feeling a bit moodswingy but it's very mild.


If anyone was reading my previous posts then yeah the tramadol combined WDS eased up just after 2 weeks. Coffee really helped too. Strong coffee. I'm starting to see how bad that WDS was though. I did feel suicidal at times and even wrote a few pages on how sad I was feeling. But that totally did melt away and I my old hobbies started to make me feel happy again. Plus I watched a load of shows on Netflix. I also forgot to take my codeine just after the WDS for a whole day and didn't feel the mental withdrawal from that. So that was nice!


Oh someone asked me about why I had these originally. I have various aches and pains that were put down to nerve problems. But after talking to the doc they started upping my dose because it helped with anxiety. And boy it does! If it didn't betray me I'd probably stick with it for years/forever! It made me into the best version of myself.

Thank you. I have been taking Pregabalin since the beginning of this month (so aroung 20 days).

I already get clonazepam, alprazolam and diazepam (I do not take all everyday, but I always take 2 mg clonazepam pr day) which should help anxiety, but initially I got started on benzo's for epilepsy and this was in the exact time where Etizolam and other RC benzo's where at their highest in Europe, so I quikcly complemented my benzo subsription with large amounts of Etizolam (5-10 mg Etizolam each day when it was worst over a period of 6 months). I guess my high tolerance for benzo's make it ineffective in treating anxiety or even contribute to my anxiety. 


So I am relieved to see that Pregabalin is working short-term and in the long-term therapy should hopefully work. In the first few days of Pregabalin I was actually euphoric (in an almost opiate like way) I guess that was due to the relief of no anxiety. This "euphoric" feelings have ofcause died down with the days, but it is still effective. I fell less general anxiety and I have had no panic attacks.


Now I will have to figure out at what dose I want to stabilize on. The guidelines i Denmark for proposed and adviced maximum dose is 600 mg. I might try to increase my dose to 2x300 mg but I will have to consider the side effects I experience in relation to the beneficial effects. It is just hard to do actually. And ofcause the addict within my automatically points my towards the largest possible dose. I will have to spend some time looking at research about doses and about "long-term" intake of Pregabalin, which is hard due to how new the drug is, but whatever research I can find about prolonged intake of pregabalin.

there's an episode dedicated to N. Ireland's use of pregabilin or 'Buds' as they call it, i never realized it could be abused like that

i was thinking of getting some to potentiate heroin - has anyone done this? if so, what dosages did you take together?

Aspiringchemist: The drunken euphoria everyone refers to seems to hit around 200 mg in one dose. Then takes 1-2 hours  to start working. After the first day it jumps quickly to about 300mg. Then 400 or 450. Etc etc etc....

Everyone taking Lyrica should beware that Pfizer has gone to great lengths to silence anybody talking badly about their drug. Most people report short term benefits, even euphoria. The long term wd's, particularly with people who have used it for a year or two, can be miserable. 

Tapering off a capsule is difficult, but I have done it with Lyrica. Open the capsule and pour out the powder. Cut the piles into lines and then cut them in half with a small knife. Cut them in half again. When you have even piles you have even doses. You can cut a 100 mg capsule into 50 or 25 mg doses easily. The powder tastes really nasty, but your single 100 mg capsule can last for 4 days and turn this into a far more gentle taper.

For me the wd's from Lyrica are as bad as a benzo, but they can start after only 3 days use.

It is not exactly heroin ot potentiation, but my Pregabalin dose complement my Methadone very well.


The first time was unintentional as I got prescribed Pregabalin for anxiety and I already took Methadone (Usually 60 mg Methadone plus 50 mg Ketobemidone or just 120 mg Methadone) and they work nice together. The first day I wanted to be careful and see how Pregabalin and Methadone interacted so I only took 50 mg Methadone that day and 150 mg Pregabalin (I think, I don't remember exactly) and I experienced euphoria throughout the day and a kind of stimulation and ability to focus.

After a few days this "euphoria experience" stopped, so if you want to use it to potentiate heroin I would say that you can only use it one time and then you ned several days or weeks with no Pregabalin to get the same experience. I don't know how long exactly as I havn't tried.


But as always you need to be careful with drugs that interact with each other. Both Pregabalin and Methadone is prescribed to me, so implicitly, my doctor must have considered whether or not it is safe for me to combine the two drugs.


Have you used heroin in a long time and daily or what is your background? No matter what be careful.

Haha. Well! Earlier today I took a juicy 300mg dose just to see if my misery cleared up as I try to pinpoint the location of my depression and mood swings. And I feel INCREDIBLE. Everything is fixed so now I know I need to not take any more (after tomorrow. I'm giving a lecture and the confidence boost will be needed).


My doc asked me if I wanted to stay on this the last time we spoke. And TBH I wouldn't mind it if it was the only drug I took (currently on an anti depressant and codeine). If I can nix them I might just stay on an infrequent dose of this. Like every other day or so, just to keep my mind stable.

That guy's doctor got him into that mess. Anybody wanting to try Lyrica recreationally should watch that documentary first. The wd's from Lyrica- even 12 hours later- can be enough to make some people commit suicide. It can really mess with your head.

Pfizer will lose their patent in the U.S. soon and then it will be just as bad there.

Hello! Just an update on my story. I polished off the last of my lyrica about 9 days ago. I had about 900mg left but instead of having 300mg a day for a few days I dropped it down to 150, then 50 so almost like a taper. I had a few commitments I didn't want to do and thought they'd help... and they really did! Even the 50mg made my day more pleasant. But I had the last one on Saturday, and it's now a week+monday later.


I fucking wish I could put my finger on what happens to me in a lyrical withdrawal. Even the smallest amount for the shortest time creates the same WDS as when I came off a huge+long dose. I used to think it was an okay withdrawal but I would feel more suicidal, drepression, the nights were REALLY bad for anxiety (waking up thinking I had made so many mistakes in my life). But the more I think about it... during lyrica withdrawal I feel like I'm just surviving. Nothing makes me laugh or feel great. Even 500mg codeine doses offer just glimmers of short-lasting euphoria (about what 60mg feels like on a normal day). I get less sleep feeling wide awake at 5am but then feel tired for the rest of the day. Naps feel great, with moments of waking feeling great until the realisation hits in.


Compare: First night I had tramadol and lyrica I couldn't sleep due to overwhelming happiness and eurphoria that lasted all night long. I lay there smiling and giggling. Everything was okay with the world, even my grandparents dementia was a-okay (reasoning= they had such a long+fulfilling life already and now have a huge full happy family to take care of them).


Also compare: when sober, very occasionally, I'd laugh myself awake because of a funny dream or because everything feels good.


I don't eat as much and solid foods just make me feel nauseous. And all this lasts 2 weeks without letting up - but then it does. During this time I floor the codeine and worry that I'm going to get used to such a high dose... but magically it all goes back to normal once the WDS has stopped.


And yet on the other hand it's also mild compared to tramadol WDS that makes me feel like a dying alien for a week, but all the time it feels like it will pass eventually. It shifts my reality slightly to one side and it feels permanently out of reach. I think that's the gentle horror of it. It's a creeping terminator, it's a malignant tumour, it's a horrible neighbour that just moved in. I created a system that eases opiate withdrawal that serves me really well (vitamin C megadoses, propranolol for sweats, hobbies and films I've put aside for rainy days, long journeys to make). But none of this even touches lyrica.


But for me that's it now. I don't have any lyrica left, none of my friends or family have any I can bum, I wouldn't even know where to get some from illegally. Phew!

Flowerpotman- why in the world would you ever go back to a drug that you know will screw your life that badly? Especially when it seems you have access to so many other great options?

I drank for years, woke up every day with a headache. But the hangover was gone by noon and I could get more whenever I wanted. If it made me that sick for that long, even once, I would never have touched the booze again!

Because it's really weird and otherworldly to me... before and after WDS I think "hey that wasn't so bad". Its WDS alters my perception completely. And sometimes I think that because I do it in a short duration - no more than a week - that it wont affect me.


I'm coming up on 2 weeks since my last one and I'm feeling almost back to normal, I'm able to be creative and enjoy things again. I catch myself walking around looking at small things in the big city and smiling.

I did some research that says it potentiates the effects of Ketamine. I'll do more research, but I will take a 300mg to 600mg before the Infusion. I'll stsck the pregabalin so that when they give me some I.V benzo right before the treatment, it will boost those effects. Also, possibly 20 mg of Valium before the infusions.

My guess is that SpeedKing is already asleep as I am writing this..... Pregabalin doesn't hit right away, and it really doesn't hit you if you're not in a quiet calm place. SpeedKing said he was 90 minutes into 1.2 grams?.... I usually barely start to feel the effects at the 90 minute mark. Unless he has a crazy high tolerance, he's got a lot of sleeping in the near future. I have no experience with ketamine, but mixed with Lorazepam it becomes a serious sedative. Similar to drinking a bottle of Gin and a bottle of Valium together.

What up King.

I took some oxy and went back to sleep after my last post.

Dude, how much pregabalin do you take daily? I have been on 150 mg / day for a while and if I bump it to 450 mg in one day I'm practically in a coma for about 12 hours. You took triple that. How are you still awake?

Thise heavy duty side effects become less of a bother after awhile:

Don't get me wrong, it is a powerful drug, but if taken correctly, you will recieve relief.

If it's too strong for example, take 75mg, twice a day. That is lightweight. That will produce results.


I'm not a spokesman for the company, but I have three buldging disks in my back. The correct dose, takes ALL the pain away. I've been on this stuff for years. 

The first time I took 900mg, I though I was on ghb or K.  To this day, It will numb me up to the point that I don't feel anything.


Pregabalin/Lyrica is defenately not for anyone. That is a true,fair statement. 

As with any medicine, don't get psychologically wrappped up in this medicine.


When you decide to stop it, technically, you can withdraw over the course of a week.  It can be like a mini(not so bad version of a) benzo taper.


Personally, it's much easier to do over a few weeks to a month. 


If anybody can tell, it has a long half life in certain people like me, especially if you take higher doses.


Honestly, 450mg in three doses should be all you need. I can hang at 600 mg a day. 


If you dose it correctly, it definitely potentiates benzodiazepines. That is a YMMV, but that's a fact. 


Btw, it pairs well with just about any amphetamine.


Numb and on amphetamines can be quite fun.


Sorry about the long post. I'm on a fat dose of this stuff.

I'm still up, but I definitely have been fading in and out. That blasted feeling you can get from a high dose in one shot or staggered, works once.


You can't truly repeat it the next day. Probably once a week. 


It doesn't pay to abuse this stuff. When you run out a week early, that blows. 


Squeaky, that high dose was for science. I do it once a while, but it's a complete waste every day.


You are correct. This stuff will kick your ass if you truly not careful.

I'm still using Lyrica daily. Only 150 mg/day. But I do bump it up to 300 or 450 if I'm trying to cut back on Oxy. The extra dose hits like alcohol and makes me sleep well enough that I can stay asleep through the short term wd's . I only take extra for 1 or 2 days, then I'm used to the lower dose of oxy and I go back to 150 mg Lyrica. 

As long as the increase is only 2 days, my only problem is a little hangover the following day. Just a little foggy and detached in the morning for a few hours.

I've been on 600-750mg of Lyrica daily for a month, to deal with pain of tapering off suboxone (currently on 1.6mg).


Now I'm worried about Lyrica withdrawal when I stop. I've been reading that it can be more hellish than opiate/benzos/alcohol etc, and last months to years. What's the verdict on this?


I'm thinking about stopping the Lyrica completely now and hoping I don't get withdrawals, and then just toughing out the rest of bupe taper. When I make the jump, I may use Lyrica for the acute phase of the bupe withdrawals.


I also take 15 mg of Valium a day. How worried about Lyrica withdrawals should I be? My brain chemistry is so messed up right now. I'm 27, I want to be sober and happy.

I know nothing about Lyrica, but jumping from that dose of bupe should be quite manageable. I jumped from two mg and I was able to go back to work, daily, after seven days since my last dose. I did wake in sweat for a month though, so nights were pretty bad that month lol - but day time was OK, tired, but OK.


I'm back to weening off methadone now though, unfortunately, planing to switch to bupe soon, so I can jump off.


Also, sorry for written words, number keys not working lol.

I concur...I have a herniated disc (repaired via discectomy surgery) and I was amazed at how well this drug works on moderate  pain to even bad pain....even with no opiates whatsoever in my system..


It's good to know it exists since opiods won't be available for pain managment  to anyone soon, since ppl without any pain issues keep on dying from IV carfent. 


the dumbass dea thinks taking pain meds away from sick, non drug abusers will somehow prevent jobless white ppl in the Northeast from slamming dirt cheap carfent.

I haven't read much about binges and comedowns with this drug.


I used this to get off opiate wd, worked very well. Too well. I've gone through nearly 54 in 3 days . Not many left , starting to feel weird like ghb wd. 


What am I in for? Don't have many left.

It's hard to get dependent on but 54 pills in 3 days? That's uncharted Territory... No idea.


Do the cognitive side effects where you feel slightly stoned from weed go away if u keep dosing daily?


I take this drug on amd off according to my pain... But it makes me kind of stupid which is a big problem for work because my job is mentally strenuous.


I'd rather just take it all the time even when not in pain of that means I get used to it and don't have these cognitive deficits. What does everyone think?

Yes , 54 pills in 3 days. Well, actually 4 


I read a few pages of the beginning of the first mega thread, a lot of posts about dosages recreationally and how safe it was.


I took 525 in one the first time, I've taken a lot of drugs over the years and this was like a combo of all those. A lot of ghb likeness, very chilled and stimulated. Also slightly trippy.


Next day I took 300, another 300, then a massive dose at night to try to get the same effect as the night previously.

That was stupid, probably took around 1.5 grams.


Next day took 900 in three doses. The last being a dose to ward off the rebound.


Today 875 in two doses and I'm done for today.


Have 4 left actually but I managed to get a few more. If you are An addict especiallY a lover of g if stay away. I feel like the long half life and resulting long withdrawal is the reason I've been redosing. I can't lose my job, it's very demanding and physical. 


I actually only got this shit to ward off codeine wd which I took for 2 months/


I know I probably deserve this. I'm a fucking idiot. I know. 


Still if no one knows what happens next in a case like this I'll just have to find out.

Hi all,


Scandinavia here. I was "sold" Lyrica in 2011 from the GP as something you cannot go wrong with, can stop how you want and is the perfect ailment for quite a pallet of probs. Well, for my nerve pains after an accident, jacking it up quite straight to 2x300mg, comboed with Tramadol, the pain relief actually beat 25uG fent patches.

That said, it's now 2017. 

I've quit fent twice (doc said 80% fails every try), not to mention switching my favourite demon, Xanax, the f away to Oxepam too. Tapering that atm...


But, trying even to lower Lyrica with 150mg, 24-36h and it's total dread mode ....and thanks, but no. Rather repeat the slavery daily, than the perpetuous 'grizzly hiding in the toilet' -vibe, along its cold sweat works.

Uncle got retired from psych career, he said the pregabalin is scary, noone's totally on point about how it even works yet (don't quote me).


Oh, and never ever have I got a narcotic effect from Lyrica. I don't use alcohol and around here seems most people mix in that - anyway, heard in the pharmacy  it's one of the biggest items on the dm now.


Strange compound. My 2 cents; use it but only if you feel you're getting out your days worth, too. This is imho RC territory in many ways.


Be safe :hi5:

I've bought a box here in the country of milano, read the leaflet.

It is sold as a drug acting on CSN, for epilepsy and GAD.

No mension to treatment of neuropathic pain or muscle relaxant properties, as use to think and use pregabalin

Lyrica (Pregabalin) has been popular in British prisons for some time now as it doesn't show up on mandatory drug tests. It was in prison that I first encountered the drug. This thread and it's predecessor have covered the majority of the issues around medical and recreational use of lyrica already but I will just chime in with what I learned about the use and withdrawal of it while in jail and since being prescribed it upon release. 


Dosage wise, the accepted standard for a 'day out' in prison was 600mg. Myself, I found I could be acceptably high without being noticeably fucked on 300mg. Naturally all drugs affect different individuals in different ways, so a happy medium for anyone else will be different. Another standard practice when taking 'pregabs' in jail is to take them on an empty stomach and not eat until you have peaked or even not at all that day. With regards to tolerance it was advised not to take them 2 days in a row. I myself would generally only do them twice a week to ensure a decent buzz. I found the effects of pregabalin to be long lasting and a 600mg dose would carry over somewhat to the next day, with an elevated mood still. I think my highest dose was 2.25g, along with 300mg of codeine. The high from that was most comparable with taking mdma and acid with a hint of diazepam. I find in higher doses I get muscle spasms in my arms and legs which can take a day or two to wear off.


Pregabs in prison were noted among hardened drug users as having a 'dirty rattle', meaning the withdrawals were potentially unpleasant. On occasions where I had found myself bingeing for a couple of weeks (a fuckin great couple of weeks by prison standards lol) and stopped dead without any contingency in place I found myself feeling cold, depressed, utterly demotivated. The 'rattle' from pregabs was known to be very emotional, more so than physical. The withdrawal lasted around 3 days. 


My advice would be take 600mg every 3 days and as stated in an earlier post don't run out coz the rattle is awful. It's always a good idea to start low as you can always add more but you can't take any away...


That being said, be safe and enjoy ?

What is the best dosing schedule to get off on lyrica ? I know there is that absorption issue where u don't get as high ...and this is HR btw. If I don't get high on lyrica I will have to use other drugs like opiates or alcohol which are worse

First, I will admit, I occasionally use higher doses due to the extraordinary relief it provides, but in the long run, it is wasteful (for me).  Tolerance is a B. 


A main reason I don't push asking the doctor to raise my dose is eventually it will not work any more. 

That' was in response to  my original dialogue I had with you.


To answer your question, I have fibromyalgia, sciatica and three bulging disks in my back.


It works well. My goal is to slowly over a few months,  lower my dosage (factoring in recreational tolerance).  As someone with an actual need for it ATM, and representing H.R, I need to be able to lead by example.


I really like what Prefabulous had to say.

They felt just like opioid WD's. I used methylphenidate to cope them for 3 days they really helped and after that ended up using pod tea again for WD's, I used for 3 months and now I stop them. I have lyricas (and lots of other drugs) again for helping to cope wds and Im using them now as low as 225mg/day and it helps greatly no need to take more even that I've used that dose for 3 days already. But this time I use max. only 2 weeks and then I stop them and I'm not going to take mega doses, I don't even feel any need to take more. Last time I used almsot 2 months daily sometimes as high doses as 3g that was total waste and I dont reccomend to do it.

I was not really sure if I was wd'ing from pod tea or pregabalin, but I felt like burning inside really nasty feelings on body. I don't recommend anyone ot take big dose for long periods. I think 2 week use i safe on lower doses? Pregabalin is maybe the best medication for opioid WD's, it really takes away almost all WD's, taking it with some stimulant like amphetamine you feel really good. But yes this time I take 2 days break after 1 week of 225mg daily dosing. I was prescripted pregabalin for general anxiety. Now I quited 3 months use of pod tea again, I wouldn't go through the wd's if I didn't have pregabalin.

If you weighed that cap and  then took 100mg - 300mgs out of total, it might curb people's appetite.  


Lyrica is a great medication, but to not have a BL standard issue, side effect issue with it. If 


that means microdosing idosage my goal),, 

That  is what I'll do, for science and HR. 

Sounds like a good experiment .

^ microdosing pregabalin? that is pretty interesting SK, what would you be hoping to attain from it though? energy/creatiivity boost? improved sleep? or just for the benefit of mankind?


i'm starting to feel the benefits myself since i started taking mine a few weeks ago - they're not Lyrica as they're too low a dose, mine are just called Pregabalin Milpharm - i take 75mgs twice a day and i do sleep a bit better and i do think i'm a bit more active than i used to be?

I just feel the risks outweigh the benifits at this point. To make a blanket statement out of this, through training, your brain may become sensitized to it. Microdosing seems to work with other drugs (to a point).

Its not really a mood stabilizer ala carbamazepine or divalproex. Helps with anxiety ans sleep if looking for its psychiatric uses but mood balancing is a no.

I have found lyrica to be massively helpful in ceasing a roughly month long foreay into heroin and while the real basis of just stopping was that I really dont like heroin, coming off it was quite horrible and made less so with it.

The bioavailability of Pregabalin is much lower when snorted, but the effects are so much faster that many abusers choose to snort the powder rather than swallowing the capsules just because of the 'rush', even though much of it's effects is wasted .

I sniffed it once. Didnt notice much of anything to be honest. Wasnt a lot, either 75 or 100mg and I probably was on a ton of oxy too maybe masking anything Id feel from it.

Lyrica is my absolute favourite pharmaceutical. I usually take very large doses (~1500 mg, I've gone over 2000 mg sometimes but that is unwise, as it can provoke seizures) a couple of times a month. I was prescribed it many years ago for GAD, 600 mg a day, but decided to taper it down because it felt like my brain was on 50% capacity all the time, it really affected my cognitive skills.


However recreationally, I find it euphoric, uplifting, social and happy. Megadoses have a hint of different substances; a bit of MDMA, GHB, alcohol and benzos...And feels slightly psychedelic and dissociative. Still quite unique. I know it's not advisable for the inexperienced, but I quite often drink some alcohol and take some benzos with it too. But too much alcohol kind of overpowers pregabalin and dulls the uplifting and even energetic feeling. 4 pints of beer is quite enough. Pregabalin, alcohol, clonazepam and weed is one of my favourite combos. But you really need to know your doses, otherwise it may result in a blackout or just falling around, hitting yourself quite badly. But I've learned my sweet spot regarding dosing through the years. If you're new to pregabalin, and want to use it recreationally, I wouldn't recommend combining it with anything before you're familiar with how it works. Still it has a high safety profile so you in practice you can't really overdose on pregabalin alone. Heavy doses also have a long effect, I can feel 1500 mg 24 hours after taking it.


Tolerance skyrockets, if taking recretionally it's almost impossible to take it for consecutive days. On the other hand, at least for me, tolerance also is back to baseline extremely fast. 3-4 days without taking pregablin is quite enough for me to get the same effect from the same dose.


Lyrica also has a strange effect of boosting pretty much everything; caffeine, nicotine, alcohol, benzos, weed, opiates...And it's great for stimulant comedowns. Sometimes though it boosts weed to uncomfortable levels, resulting in extreme and unpleasant confusion.


Addiction is a bitch, I had a period when I used heavy doses for a prolonged time and the WD were quite bad. Nowhere near benzo or alcohol WD but still very nasty, the anxiety and depression was worse than on benzo or alcohol WD. On the other hand, I've found pregablin to be a wonderdrug for benzo and alcohol WD. With the help of pregablin, I was able to taper my benzos much faster. I've understood it's great for opiate WD too, although I've never used opiates really (except trying oxydocone and codeine a couple of times.


The only downside with Lyrica is the very slow onset, even on an empty stomach it takes 2-3 hours to really kick in. If I've eaten a heavy meal, the effects really kick in after 4-5 hours. That's why I always take it on an empty stomach and eat afterwards (I get the munchies on Lyrica).


Do you also get extremely red eyes and blue circles below the eyes on Lyrica? I've wondered what causes this. Blood pressure? This is very visible on high doses, and my eyes look completely freaky.

I have lyricas (and lots of other drugs) again for helping to cope wds and Im using them now as low as 225mg/day and it helps greatly no need to take more even that I've used that dose for 3 days already. But this time I use max. only 2 weeks and then I stop them and I'm not going to take mega doses, I don't even feel any need to take more. Last time I used almsot 2 months daily sometimes as high doses as 3g that was total waste and I dont reccomend to do it.

> I was not really sure if I was wd'ing from pod tea or pregabalin, but I felt like burning inside really nasty feelings on body. I don't recommend anyone ot take big dose for long periods. I think 2 week use i safe on lower doses? Pregabalin is maybe the best medication for opioid WD's, it really takes away almost all WD's, taking it with some stimulant like amphetamine you feel really good. But yes this time I take 2 days break after 1 week of 225mg daily dosing. I was prescripted pregabalin for general anxiety. Now I quited 3 months use of pod tea again, I wouldn't go through the wd's if I didn't have pregabalin.

I have been in a detox facility lately, the doctor there is completely against lyrica, for her it is just another drug like benzos or opiates. This time she even switched me against my will to gabapentin. Almost all patients i have met, had experience with pregablin or were even addicted to it. Pregabalin has now become a standard item in open drug markets in the next big town just like clonazepam, diazepam, methadon, buprenorphin, etc. It has been pushed so much, the streets are flooded with pregabalin, now. 


I have been using it for some years for neuropatic pain, in doses up to 300mg daily. I did a gradual tapper over two weeks and had no problem coming off of it.


BUT, since i know pregabalin, i haven't even tried one opiate kick without it, it is *the* most important item to use in acute opiate withdrawal. If i could only keep one item to kick opiates it would be lyrica, without a second thought. 


Right now opiate withdrawal is the only reason i take it, i don't even like the high that much. Your balance is off, you are dumbed down, well it has some stimulant and simultaneously sedative effect. The pain killing properties are top notch, that is for sure. Its a little bit empathogen, too. Mixed with some adderall and lope, you feel quite nice even in bad withdrawals. I think it also synergies well with coffee.

I am intrigued by this. I'm going to source some and try 600mg based on Prefabulous's nice and informative post. 


Experienced users - would you recommend a first time user try it by itself? Or along with an opiate for potentiation? (If I did option 2, I would lower my opiate dose)

I have access to 75mg Lyrica or 150mg Lyrica.

What would be a good starting dose?


Background info: I weigh 110lbs. My doctor will not prescribe me Gabapentin or Pregabalin due to my history of opiate addiction because he is worried I would abuse them too. I have crippling sciatica so I have taken matters into my own hands, getting the Pregabalin/Lyrica.

I am not taking it for a high, I'm taking it because I am in severe pain.

Okay thanks. This topic contains numbers all the way from 75 to 2000 so I picked a post that seemed to be from a well informed user, and that was also lauded by other users as a good post, to come up with the number of 600.


Should I start even lower? Or is 300 a good first time dose?

300mg is plenty for a first time use. Its the highest strength it comes commercially and you almost never see it prescribed at 300mg exactly because it can be a bit too much in terms of the effects one wouldnt want therapeutically but would recreationally.

Shartito, how did you get on with the 300? I think that's a high enough dose for a 1st time user, I'm on 600mg myself daily for GAD & fibromyalgia but I only take 400mg cozI don't want a sky high tolerance

300 mg is quite good for a first-timer. The doses I take recreationally would be complete and utter overkill and overwhelming for the inexperienced. Even for experienced users the doses I take can be too much, some just prefer to enjoy 300-600 mg recreationally and I totally understand that. I'm still intoxicated by 1500 mg 20 hours after taking it. It has a longer effect than the half life would indicate. If you take a somewhat large dose in the evening, you'll still be intoxicated when you wake up.


Pregabalin is really intoxicating without tolerance, so start low and then up the dose when you're familiar with how it works.

Will do. I'm gonna get 600 mg. 


Try 300 by itself first. 


Then 150 with a small dose of opiates. 


Then 150 with a larger dose of opiates if the first time works out. 


That's if I can even source any. Gonna have to do some legwork. But I'm super intrigued by this. I've heard of Lyrica many times, but if wasn't until reading this thread that I learned of the recreational value.

Was thinking about phenibut vs. lyrica earlier today. Phenibut in high doses can feel pretty nice but low doses aren't very effective and cause me to get headaches. Lyrica in low doses is just lovely and helps with work anxiety. High doses of lyrica are messy and nothing like phenibut. If I had to choose I would choose lyrica due to its help in getting me through an anxiety ridden work day.

When you say "low doses are lovely" and help at work, what kind of "low" are you talking about? 300mg? Or lower?


That's actually the result I'm looking for. I don't want to be all fucked up and stumbling around.

In your case even 150 mg would be enough, 300 mg can be very intoxicating if you don't have any tolerance. If you are at work, I wouldn't take more than 150 mg. If you're not at work and don't have any relatives around you, 300 mg would really give you a feel of how pregabalin feels.


One thing you can add is nicotine. There's an insane synergy between pregabalin and nicotine. I don't smoke but I vape and use snus, and vaping liquid with a high nicotine amount boosts Lyrica (or the other way) very nicely.

Ok cool. Thank you. 


Yeah I do vape as well (I'm 95% off cigarettes, finally) 


It's probably going to take me a few days to source some. That will give me plenty of time to do more research. Including reading this giant thread all the way through lol.

Good question... I pretty much always have people around me. But don't really advertise that I'm using something. For example, half the time I'm at work, I'm on opiates.


EDIT - If I am able to find any lyrica, I would dose at home first, and not work. If that better helps answer your question.

I was just thinking from the perspective that Lyrica intoxication is quite visible (the eyes especially) and your speech may (or will be on higher doses) be slurry. So it makes quite the difference if you are just alone at home or with people that you don't want to see that you're intoxicated.

Beware lyrica severley fucks your cognitive and reading abilities in a subtle way that is easy to miss....not like opioids which leave your higher executive faculties in tact other than drowsiness. You litterlay won't be able to read properly on lyrica.

Its stronger but gabapaentin feels little different, I'd say the both have their plusses and minuses, for me when taking 3,5g without tolerance I get very energetic and motivated  but without the drunk walk, but with pregabalin I get GHB/MDMA/and little bit of psychedelic feeling when taking without tolerance about 600mg.


I've been using pregabalin for now about 6 days with doses 600-1600mg, I know I need to have tolerance break for 3 days. Whats the longest period of safe use is without getting wds and how long break you have to have before starting using again? I think I'm going on speed for 4 days for getting tolerance break before going back to pregabalin. Im Wd'ing from opium so I need every help out there. Just benzos are not enough for me.

Pregabalin (Lyrica) would, no lie, be my drug of choice if it weren't for its inherent proclivity to produce tolerance. I know others probably have different experiences, but generally, by day 3 of Pregabalin use, I am at a point where even several grams will not affect me. I'm currently in a cycle where I will use Gabapentinoids on days that I don't have Opioids and vice versa and it works. Gabapentinoids get rid of 90% of my withdrawal symptoms when I'm not completely tolerant.

I initially tried it for anxiety, but most docs don't know that. I just went on Pfizer's site and got the documentation showing it IS approved for that and brought it to my appointment. I'd rather take kava to be honest. I'd rather take this crap instead of having horrible anxiety with nothing to take for it though..I find it useless for my nerve pain which I take Hydromorphone for and it works great with minimal side effects.

I've read that for most people 3 days of break restarts the tolerance, I havent really abued pregabalin for 5 months, Last week I took it for 4 days, then had 4 day break worked again like first time, so today is my first break after 6 days of pregabalin use, I don't feel any pregabalin WD's thought ( and even more important no opioid WD's) I'm on speed and clonatzepam from the morning till I go to sleep, yes I often go sleep while (meth)amphetamine is still working, usually my last dose is 3 hours before sleeping, I take 200mg quetiapine and sleep good for next 6 hours. I never skip my sleep or morning meal thats have been my rule evenr since I started to use amphetamines. but I don't think 6 days of use pregabalin causes any problems anyway, at least have never cause to me, I only got pregabalin WDS when I used them almost 2 months in doses 800mg-3g (I know stupid, dangerous and useless). Now Im planning to have at least 5 days break from pregabalin, and after that I take break from speed and clonatzepam. For 5 days when I use only pregabalin, I usually need to double the effect to get even little similar effects like from the first time, its not as strong but something at least.

I hated it. I like all sorts of other things (opiates, weed, speed). All I thought Lyrica did was make me dizzy, a bit drunk, and fairly nauseous. I can't understand why its apparently so popular. If I only take a little it works to help me sleep. That's the only good thing I can say about it. (There - how's that for encouraging harm reduction!)

Lyrica synerdizes with weed so well. The body high aspects are really brought out and the visual static aspect is enhanced as well.

So I have  question about how to use pregabalin without getting physically addicted to it? It has been one of the medications I take for opium WD's, its great,, but I take only max. 3 days because the good feeling goes away, thene I might take speed for 5 days, and then GBL for 5 days, then turn back to pregabalin, so far I haven't felt any WD's form it when I'm not taking it. Also my tolerance seems to go zero just in 3 days, I mean I took on 3rd day around 1500mg pregabalin to feel ok, then 3 days I took amphetamine, then I went back to pregabalin and 600mg gave amazing mood.


So it seems it is safe to take 2 days pregabalin with any doses, then have at least 3 days break from it?


I once got physically addicted to it when I used it 2 months everyday some days even 3g. It felt horrible when I stopped using it, but surprisingly methylphenidate took all the pain away. So I know how pregalin WD's feel, so this time I''m trying to be very careful. I'm not planning to use pregabalin very long, just two weeks more when opium wds are completely gone, so I need to know that  if 3 day use 3 day break really works? Also I happened to use 1 month lots of speed, also meth for one week was great, and today I decided that now its enough of this amphetamine use, starter to make me very paranoid about police. After last dose was fading away I welt comedown from the whole week, also cravings to buy more amphetamines, then I took 600mg and it made everything better it fixed the amphetamine induced comedown, also NO CRAVINGS AT ALL!  So I'm not going to use any stimulants anymore because I promised it to the one I love very much. So now I don't know what to to use on break days? I used GBL 24h for 10 days straight, and no comedown or wds came from it, but well I was als on pregabalin on that last day day. But the nice effects of GBL faded away to stupid drunk feeling, instead the ecstasy feeling you get when haven't used for long time. Well I quit GBL 20 days ago, I don't have any cravings for it, but would 20 days be enough to restore the good feeling on it?


Also I have clonazepam, but just using clonazepam only makes me depressed.

Now I have started to to walking in woods while on pregabalin, so I do get some exercising and the good effects that forest can produce on human mind (it has been studied just 15 min walk in forest have positive effect on mood). When I used speed 1 month (usually 3-5 days then break 2-3 days and another run with speed), I slept everyday but I didn't eat anything, so now I feel very weak, gladly pregabalin makes you hungry and Im getting my energy back.


So any suggestions how to make all this break thing work what to use? I really need pregabalin for only 2 more weeks, then I quit it, I really don't want to get physically addicted to it again, but its miracle drug, so I really need make my plan to work.


edit. ah I totally forget gabapentin, I haven't used them now, but going to get as much I can, so I need to know would it work that if use 3 days pregabalin then 3 days gabapentin? As they have same action on brain, and have cross-tolerance but do they have cross-addiction? I really hope that not, becausw would be great to switch between them and avoid any physical addiction (I would do that only 2 weeks, would you even get addicted on that time?).


Also I try to get phenibut but its very hard to get here so I´might not get it, but if I do would it have any cross-addiction? Or can I use it one break days and so not getting addicted to neither.


Also maybe overreact, I mean I haven't really used pregabalin on bast month that much, only am,phetmines and occasionally clonazepam on speed. So would it be even possible to get wds from 2 weeks use of pregabalin, gabapentin or phenibut? For other drugs 2 weeks use might give little shitty feeling but not really a wds. Amphetamine 2 weeks use gives one really bad day but on second day you feel all ok, this was from meth. Also I can use benzos for 2-3 weeks every day and when stopping not getting any wds. So I doubt 2 week' use would cause physical addiction with these drugs.

Well Im on speed again because I run out of pregabalin and cant get an y gabapentins or phenibut. Shitty 25e/g speed needed to take 0,6g to feel it, my tolerance is high, but yerah fuck it I get some meth as soon as my main  guy is back in town. And no its not cryastal and you cant vaporize it anyway, its just powder. At least it works better.

Hey! I am no expert at all but maybe I have some ideas that can help you.

First of all, you are NOT crazy! It may seem so and it can feel so real, but it is not. 


Lyrica is said to stop new synapses from forming. Maybe that is why it takes so long to recover from.

Both ashwagandha and bacopa stimulates dendrites and axons to grow in the brain. So this could be of some help.


Ashwagandha

Bacopa monnieri


Check out examine.co* and pubmed


There are many reliabel sources. And remember that there is always HOPE!

Lyrica is much stronger (both more potent and more intoxicating). I've tried gabapentin a few times, with high doses, to achieve a recreational effect. I've tried both taking all at once and the staggering method. I didn't find it especially enjoyable, and the intoxication was quite mild. Although you're more functional on gabapentin. Lyrica really hits you hard in high doses, and is much more euphoric, anxiolytic and strangely dissociative and slightly psychedelic.


Lyrica is considerably more messy, it really fucks you up on high doses, you are completely and utterly wasted. I never achieved that with gabapentin. Gabapentin also has a poor bioavailability, while pregabalin has a bioavailability of ≥90%. So you can just take all Lyrica at once  and don't need to stagger. Also Lyrica, especially in high doses, has a longer effect. Just my opinion. I think gabapentin quite sucks for recreational use.

Strangely I found that when I took speed one day and couldn't sleep for 2 days, I took first 600mg pregabalin, but it didn't work, so another 600mg staqrted to the usual high. But now taking only 600, fitst 300mg after 1 hours another 300mg. that would work the best way.

I think I took the second heaviest dose ever today, I'm now now on 2300 mg (although I have a slight tolerance). It's not good for your kidneys so this shouldn't be done often.


It's interesting that on these mega doses I get manic; I have cleaned my apartment with the vacuum cleaner, mopped the floor, put on the dishwasher and the washing machine, cleaned the bathroom, I can't stand dirt when high on Lyrica. I do everything I hate to do when I'm sober on Lyrica with no problems, I don't know why. It was actually funny to clean the bathroom. And I absolutely **hate** it when I'm sober. But for me it's not sedating at this dose, well kind of in a way, but I was fully functional and energetic. But I do have some tolerance, so I'm not as high as I would be without tolerance. Usually on 1500+ mg doses I get twitchy, and my muscles start to twitch annoyingly. In fact, although Lyrica is an anticonvulsant, in these doses it's actually a convulsant and can induce seizure-like symptoms and uncontrollable twitches. That's why I usually take clonazepam with it, it complete removes all the twitching.


It can be tricky to find your sweet spot with Lyrica, I'm usually on 1500 mg, not as much as today. I just wanted to try, and the result was that I got manic. In the end a bit too manic, so a few pints did the trick. Although I have to say my usual 4 pints would be too much right now, Lyrica boosted the two pints to such a level that I feel I don't want to boost anymore, I kind of know when to stop, as to avoid blackouts. But when I added alcohol, started drinking a few pints, everything changed. The energy was gone and everything became more dreamy and messy. But it still feels nice, but totally different than on Lyrica alone.


The trick with high doses, especially combined with alcohol and benzos, is to find your sweet spot. If you overdo it, you will black out and that's nasty. I've experienced it a few times, but I'm so familiar with this compound (in combination with benzos and alcohol) that I never blackout anymore, I know pretty much exactly how much I can take. This combo feels like GHB/MDMA, flouting on clouds, euphoric and calm, like being wrapped in warm blankets. Not a single worry. The most anxiolytic combo I've found, Lyrica is IME more anxiolytic than benzos.

Neo..... dude you have access to entirely too many drugs.

Gabapentin and Lyrica are like smoking pot and smoking tobacco. You will have cross tolerance and cross withdrawls. 

With all of the pills you're playing with here, there's no way to predict what kind of withdrawls you're going to have. It sounds like you figured out a system that works. Just try not to get in too deep with anything that you can't get more of if you need. Cold turkey from long term Lyrica or Gabapentin use can be miserable.

Nnh didn't use pregbalin too many days, also didn't get any gabas, speed was most I used, tomorrow going to be totally sober as I run out every single drung in my stash, not that its problem to get something like amphetamines, but not taking them anymore are getting any good comedown ( I mean from 5 days use) pills is very hard to get by I mean pregabalins, I used my only scripts that I get every month, they are very rare in drugmarket here with gabapentins which I didn't get any, maybe thats  good. So wish me luck....

Umm did you really just say there's a cross tolerance and withdrawal between tobacco and cannabis...? Lol.


You are absolutely correct in saying such a thing in regards to Gabapentin/pregabalin, but your statement on tobacco/cannabis is absolutely ridiculous, I'm sorry.


Tobacco and cannabis have completely different compositions, different alkaloids, and affect all different biochemicals and sites within the human body from one another.

They have absolutely nothing in common (aside from the gnarly combustion byproducts they release as plant material), produce completely different effects due to their completely different biochemical makeup and therefore completely different affected sites and actions, completely different pharmacodynamics- these two drugs have nothing in common pharmacologically (or really anything else aside from being plant material) and have ABSOLUTELY ZERO cross tolerance or cross withdrawals. This is ridiculous.


I apologize for being so blunt and direct- perhaps a bit harsh- but your statement is just absolutely beyond silly, misguided/misinformed/uninformed and can't be ignored for others to fall for such misinformation.


There are several ways that addiction/habitual use of these two substances can go hand in hand, but they are not at all pharmacologically similar and do not carry any mutual psychoactive, tolerance, nor addictive effects. This statement of yours is absolutely false and simply absurd. Check your sources of information man....


Neo- As for your inquiry regarding 2 weeks use of these 3 substances (gabapentin, pregabalin, phenibut), they all 3 act similarly- at same sites and mutual/similar fashions/actions, are very similar substances anyway- and so yes, they DO indeed carry cross tolerance and addiction. Rotating them would help.....but only to a degree.....


I can't predict the future whether or not you'll get addicted/chemically dependant, nor do I know you, your body, your health, your lifestyle, etc.....so it's impossible for me to accurately predict such a complex occurrence.....but it is MOST CERTAINLY, ABSOLUTELY, AND UNDOUBTEDLY A SERIOUS, HIGH, LEGITIMATE POSSIBILITY- and must not be disregarded or taken for granted.


I recommend great caution and mindfulness, serious responsibility in your utilization of these substances. Respect them.


Good luck neo, and never hesitate to ask if you need assistance with anything, we're all here to help ya.

Also, please, actually give some degree of consideration to my words....I did take the time to try to genuinely help ya out....so please don't throw it in my face or take it for granted.

I too, would say GHB is the drug that most resembles Lyrica. There's that same "tingly" feeling in my stomach that I get from GHB.


I got a prescription for a pot of 200 capsules of 300 mg each, but the pot is getting empty at a fast rate... I also got some Triazolam: both complement each other rather good, I must say. I'm thinking about which benzo I'm going to ask my doctor next time to complement the Lyrica. I'm thinking about asking him for some Brotizolam, some Flurazepam of maybe some Lorazepam or some Diazepam...

Thanks for  help and info. I can't  get my hands on phenibut or gabapentins, only can get pregabalinf for 3-4 day use, because nobody is selling them illegally, so I use my own prescription which I got. So no risk of addiction.


I can get GBL vut I need to go to other town, but I feel like death from opium WD's so even that I know it would help I just feel like dying, cant buy any food, can do anything.

PerpetualAnhedonic-


(Edit-writing this made me see that you are actually correct. I was thinking a bit differently about addiction and less about cross-tolerance, but I'll post this anyway.)

I was trying to be short and sweet but I should have elaborated a little more in my statement regarding cross tolerance of tobacco and weed: Part of the addiction and therefore the high associated with cigarettes is not just the nicotine. Having something to occupy your hands during stressful situations, or a reason to hang out with your 'smoking buddies' , or even just knowing that you have a target waiting for you at the end of a long day. These are all components of addiction, and they can be the same for different types of addictions. 

In short, beer drinkers often drink lots of soda because of the feeling of a cold can and the carbonation. Pill junkies always hit the pharmacy for tylenol and immodium. And potheads almost always smoke cigarettes when they're not smoking weed. It satisfies a small part of the addiction even though the drug is not available.

Part of the relief a person gets from switching from Lyrica to Gabapentin is just knowing that they're holding a bottle of pills that work the same. And the knowledge that they are similar can either  lessen or magnify their effects. Placebo effect I guess, but it is undeniably real.

A few months ago I posted a message saying how much I hated pregabalin. I discovered, by a bit of experimentation (caused by a slight shortage of codeine), that I quite like combining codeine and pregabalin. I was quite careful - 150mg pregabalin, about 300mg codeine (I have a bit of tolerance - I need 800mg codeine to leave me in a state close to nodding). As Bluelight is all about safety I'd like some advice about the safety of this combination. Would increasing the doses of either be dangerous? What should I look out for as danger signs?

Drs. Gave me a script for amytriptaline to treat peripheral neuropathy, had to try it for a month before she could get insurance approval for Lyrica. It sucked and didn't help the neuropathy at all.

ive been on pregabalin for 1 year and a half 600mg and a dose of 600mg STILL gets me high as fuck. ive taken huge doses before like 4200 mg plus drinking and been barely able to walk and the high was intense, but 600 still gets you nicely high.


if anyone doubts that pregabalin works, take it from its the real deal. ive tried to get high on benzos and all sorts and none of them really did much, pregabalin is different. pregabalin feels like an opiate that also gives you lots of mental energy.

Been taking this more often than gabapentin. It definitely is stronger, but has the tendency to give me nasty myoclonic jerking.

Just a quick point of interest...


Earlier today i had a brief conversation with a Pharmacist regarding the interaction of Codeine with Pregabalin. The Pharmacist proceeded to tell me that new information suggests that high doses of Codeine and Pregabalin can lead to fits and seizures. This made my arse twitch a little as i was on 975mg of lyrica and 300mg of codeine at that point. I've had serious muscle spasms on high doses of the drugs in question and, as in my leg leaping up of its own accord and arm muscles over reacting when i reach for something. 


Has any one on this board had a full blown seizure or anything close to one?

As I mentioned, I get nasty jerks when on lyrica and gabapentin at high doses. Sometimes it makes me just fall on my ass where I'm standing - it's like my brain shuts off for a sec.


I took 6 grams of gabapentin one night trying to mitigate tianeptine withdrawals and I had a nasty seizure. I've also felt VERY close to one on about a gram of lyrica... I know those are high doses but yes, I think it can happen if you get that paradoxical effect from these meds.

Can someone please explain me how Phenibut acts compared to Pregabalin? I have lots of experiance with Pregabalin. Does tolerance with Phenibut build up as fast? Cross-tolerance? I've decided to take Pregabalin >900mg every other weekend. That strategy works pretty well. Would the Phenibut screw with that strategy when I take it in between these weekends? How do high doses compare? For example 1500mg Pregabalin vs. 2000mg Phenibut? Effects, nodding, hangover?

Hi, i wonder if there is anyone who has experience with a cheaper version of Pregabalin? Where i bought it from it's in 300 mg Pfizer capsules. But when i opened one up, the powder was more like a crystallized substance. This is not what real pharmacy Lyrica looks like where i live (Sweden), so i'm just trying to find out what the differens is between the two versions. Cant seem to get a straight answer on any swedish forums so i turn to you ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) The cheaper ones work and taste like real Pregabalin powder and have the same effects, only a little lighter.

Thanks in advance ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Pfizer still holds the patent for Pregabalin/Lyrica. So in the USA there is no generic or substitute. My guess is that Pfizer is not distributing it's own version of a generic substitution anywhere in the world, and occasionally even a good pharmacy gets tricked into stocking fake pills. Maybe that's what you have.

Maybe, but this crystallized powder exist and is being sold in large quantities. It's the most sold item where i'm buying it from. Although, it seems like sometimes they have the crystallized powder and at other times (not as often i think) the powder is more like original Pfizer. It's a little shady, so i dont think i'll buy it anymore, just to be on the safe side ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) But the curiousity eats me up.

EP158207 it's probably not just in your head. I know someone who started getting a generic for the anti-depression med she was taking for years and she almost comitted suicide. The original was 24 timed release but the generic wasn't. That turned out to be a small difference but it had huge consequence.

Lyrica is just odd for me. Have done few times, first time I started at 300mg but noticed nothing and went higher with other times. Had pauses between too, days or even weeks


But only thing that happened to me was that I walked like a drunk and had balance issues. It did help a little bit to the anxiety too. But otherwise nothing. Ive heard lots of different stories how people have felt under this thing and some have said that there has been lots of euphoria like feeling too. But I go none :/ But dont know, maybe my body is just fucked up, didnt get anything out of MDMA either. Well, except excessive sweating, hilarious looking eyes and for some reason, chewing my teeth


Is it true though that lyrica is a great booster for other drugs?

When I was on pregabalin I often was given the generic instead of the brand (Lyrica) and there is absolutely zero difference. They wouldn't be able to sell them in the UK if there was...


However, comparing an instant release brand drug with a time released generic (any drug) is a different ball game all together and not a fair comparison.

Just quited my long high dose binge with GBL, used only 4 days until it made me puke and extreme headache even with lowest doses. Now I have lost every kind of intrest on that shit, total poison, I still have that shit in my closet that don't have even smallest wanting to use it again. Now I took gabapentin for few days and after that taking 10 days 4mg xanax /day, I never have been benzo addict and I can handle them so not going to use longer than that one week. After that I try to be clean, fuck pregabalin for me is even more addicting than opium, people say that it loses its recreational use after one day, thats not true, first after 4 days break givev very nice high, but afte that it feels more like barbiturates, it rises mood, it makes you energetic and takes away anxiety, so it works me more like anti-depressant, and yes even after 3 months daily use I still get that good feeling, and jsut keepin 3 days break taking 300mg lyrica daily and then taking 600mg at once is gioving very nice high. I enjoyed them too much, much like with my honeymood with opium, opium is best opioid ever, better than oxys or fentanyls.


I have script for small amount pregabalin every month and I end up using them in 10 days as I use doses 750-1050mg doses even that I was prescipted for 3x75mg. Better quit now because have used only 2 months, so shouldnt be that bad, I already feel that the wds ahave gone better, no desperation anymore, even under effect of that poison GBL i stil lfelt deperated, but now after 7 days of last pregabalin already feeling like I want to live, sitll have physical wd's like sweating, but I go throught it.


Keep safe when you are playign with pregabalin, in my books by addictivity it comes second to opioids, it even more addicting than meth (which never gave me problems).

I want to stop using this drug, but it causes massive depression if I quit it. How slow should I tapper it? My doses are normally 150mg morning and 150mg at night, I also sabuse it time to time up to 950mg. I feel so helpless, I can't stand the depression, any advice? I also take quetiapine for sleeping, and now I'm suspecting it might be the one that causes anhedonia and depression, I have quit pregabalin few times but didn't have any depression. Maybe should start some new anti-depressant. I constantly thinking about suicide if I'm not on pregabalin.

Yes, I agree about the equivalent of Lyrica to alcohol! But being a single mother of two young ones, I can't take it as prescribed. I only take it to ward of withdrawals, and or when I need help sleeping! Because of that, I've got like 700 200mg tablets stacking up in my med cabinet. Today, without warning, my doc changed my MS Contin to Morphabond. Yuck! Do you know anything about this new "addict resistant " drug? I can't find anything on BL about it??!

Ruby97-

Everyone seems to react differently to Lyrica. Take no more than 150 mg and wait at least 2 hours before taking any more. Take no more than 300 mg the first day. Tolerance builds in a couple of days, so if you're using recreationally then try to use it no more than two or three days on and three or four days off to avoid building a huge tolerance and wd's. Wd's can vary greatly from one person to another, some say worse than opiates and benzos, some say next to nothing. Make sure you have either only enough for a few days, or enough for a long taper and time to get more, as some experience major suicidal depression from the wd's and you don't want to run out if you get hooked.

Wd's for me feel and last much the same as doing tequila shots all night.

Then read this whole thread when you have time...... there's a ton of good info here.

Opium WD's are 10x times worse than pregabalin. But pregabalin for me is more like insomnia and lots of sweating, but I have used only 3 months daily, sure it can be worse if used daily for years.

I must just be really lucky as I've been on pregabalin on and off (mostly on) for about 4 years and have never had any withdrawls when stopping and starting. Opiate painkillers on the other hand I've had tremendous problems coming off. As a side note though, pregabalin has been a tremendous aid when going through opiate withdrawls....probably even more so than a benzo but I've always found that if I've had pregabalin, a benzo (any one) and clonidine, opiate withdrawls are much more manageable. I'm not sure exactly what properties of pregabalin make it so helpful during opiate withdrawls (something to do with it being an NMDA antagonist or something).

Opiate painkillers on the other hand I've had tremendous problems coming off. As a side note though, pregabalin has been a tremendous aid when going through opiate withdrawls....probably even more so than a benzo but I've always found that if I've had pregabalin, a benzo (any one) and clonidine, opiate withdrawls are much more manageable. I'm not sure exactly what properties of pregabalin make it so helpful during opiate withdrawls (something to do with it being an NMDA antagonist or something).

Yes i quited my last opium use with pregabalin, and now I'm on them every day, but at least they are easy to tapper and tolerance goes down very fast. Pregabalin  for me takes almost every opioid/opiate WD away, so it's wonder drug for almost any wd's. For pregabalin WD's, its mostly insomnia and sweating for me, but the sweating is os bad that it makes body feel very bad, I could go throught them if I had benzos.

I haven't found pregabalin to make me zombie, but it takes off anxiety so I am able to function, also it will rise my mood. It's much better drug for anxiety than benzos.

What you have exeperienced is normal.

Strongest effect is muscle relaxing -> I walked like a drunk and had balance issues

It is anxiolitic -> It did help a little bit to the anxiety too

It can give mood elevation , but this like for every drug vary from person to person

That is, just it is not for you.

It is for me. Also for me it is first a muscle relaxer, than an anxilotic ( better than benzo) , plus I have a *light* high , and overall I like this.

Someway similar to alcool, with more body load but more clear-headed

Well, guess to sum up-some people take it for the high relaxation feel and some like me for chronic nerve pain-until I had Z grand mal Seizure on it (normal dose only week one), scary!!  Not a drinker anymore either..thinking it didn’t get along with herbs I was taking but to this day have no idea.  My medical opinion-don’t play with ? fire if you don’t need it, almost killed me, literally!

It’s Lyrica (brand name) from Pfizer you have.  The generic is the other-it’s not ones to sell yet here in the USA.  Drug companies (Pfizer that invented) has 7 yrs. dibs on it before it can be sold by a competitor with the other name for a less money for the buyers-us.

Hi again, lol. I’ve been feeling down for some days due to lyrica WD. This is the 3rd time I’ve come off it and each time seems to get worse slightly. I haven’t felt truly happy or the slightest bit of contentment for those days and I’m finding it hard falling asleep. But I’m thinking about keeping my admittedly low dose going for Christmas. I love this holiday and it’s gonna be my last chance of a great one so I don’t wanna mess it up. 


Got my physio in feb so then begins the slow withdrawal from my opiates.

I think pregabalin will be my medication for rest of my life, maybe I can rise it to 300mg three times a day, so 900 totally. it gives me energy, motivation and conceration, it rises my mood it takes away my anxiety, it makes me talkative. I've been hearing about horror stories of pregabalin WD's, I can't see an way to stop using pregbabalin if I get same hellish WD's like other people do. Because I rather kill myself than get any WD's, and I really mean it if I get hellish wd's I will commit suicide and no one can change my mind, unless guiding me how to quit it without WD's. SO far I only start to sweat like hell, everything is wet, and I can't get sleep, and I will not take any quetiapine or mirtazapine for it they make me depressed, I haven't noticed any depression during pregbalin depression, anxiety yes, but my mood is usually pretty good even, but in the other hand I have been using only 2 months (doses 150-1,500mg depending tolerance and situation), to get hellish wd's you must eat  over 1 year or even longer.

IV been taking pregabalin for around a year and also take Prozac. I find the high amazing. I take 150ml around 3 times a week and 300ml around 2 times a week. I feel great eurporia and a speed like high. Feel on the ball, super social and can get things done. Only negative seems to be a bit of irability and a faster heart beat.

I love this stuff makes me feel like I can accomplish anything.

Please slow it down and take breaks. The amazing high will eventually wear off, and whatever anxiety you had initially will come back. I used to take it every other day, for 2 years until it just stopped being fun. It just helped the pain, but the high diminished over time. You are taking almost a gram a day in split doses or rather, intending to do so. Please, slow it down so you can enjoy the honey moon months for longer.

I'm using this stuff again recently but only a couple times a week max. It's especially good for combos. Eases anxiety and comedown from stims, adds euphoria and nods to opiates, potentates benzos. Lovely.

Be careful because if you’re like me one day it’ll just stop working. I amped up my dose and had keep doubling just to get the same feeling as the previous days. At that point it just isn’t sustainable. I remember days where I’d take 300mg capsules 6-7 times and I couldn’t get that anxiety quelling high.


I’m on day 3 now of a cold turkey and it’s not tooooooo bad. Just sweats, difficulty staying asleep, lack of energy but not in a bad way… it’s a good chill but downside is I’m getting nothing done.

Taking Lyrica/Pregablin between 900-1200 mg on daily basis. Helps a lot with anxiety and self-confidence, gives a lot of motivation, reduce depression to almost inexistent level. Like the feeling it give. Here in Central Europe, quite easy to get prescriptions, and original Lyrica is refunded by public health insurance, one pack of 150 mg - 56 tabs costs me less than a dollar. I live in a great area :-D


On the other side, there is some loss of memory and give some loss of coordination. Stopped for a week recently, had previous state of depression, complete loss of motivation coming back, but didn't felt any withdrawal problems. Taking already for 6 months, but at the beginning in lower doses. Wondering, if there will be long terms effects at the end?

Yeah I take around 300mg-3000mg daily, I know one day I need to quit. I've been off few days, the insomnia is very bad and the sweating, and I don't have any sleeping aid. It wouldnt that bad if I had sleep aid and something to take off the sweeting. I dont experience depression or anxiety much if I excerice and meditate. But right now I need them.

Taking sometime 150-300mg Trazodone for sleeping, when I cannot fall asleep naturally, but didn't felt any insomnia when I quit for a week, but yes noticed sweating during sleep, was totally wet in the morning. I don't think that insomnia was induced by Lyrica, as I already had sleeping problems long before. And when I am on Lyrica, I usually sleep well. 

Also, Pregabalin makes you want to eat more, and I gained some weight. Furthermore, you can try not to eat/less, and then you're almost not hungry, if you force yourself. Lost 5 kg, using this method while I'm on Lyrica.

Will there be any synergy between pregabalin and gabapentin? Or will it be waste to take them same time, I was going to boost opioid effects, so thats why I ask.

You'd be wasting the gabapentin, I'd reckon. Stick to the lyrica, save the gabapentin for a rainy day. Remember lyrica doesn't suffer from the absorption issues that gabapentin does.

No prob. I use both to mitigate opiate withdrawal. When I wake up in the morning dopesick it takes about 3 hours of staggering gabapentin doses to get me right. With lyrica I just take one moderate ~200-300mg dose and I'm good to go in a half hour tops.

It really helps with RLS, stomach issues, temperature sweating. Everything aparantly. Never used it for that purpose but many friends have done so.

It's the closest thing to a non-opiate panacea out there. The effects aren't always consistent, and they wane a bit if you take it for several days in a row in high amounts, but for most people it virtually eliminates all withdrawal. For me, everything but the sneezes. You have to redose at least one more time daily and the effects take a while to come on but yes, if you have access to some keep them on hand.

I once went from 750mg of codeine/day to 250mg and felt no withdrawal effects because of lyrica. It gives me energy and removes depression and anxiety. 


.


So I’m on day 4 or 5 from cessation, after an irregular dose schedule but last few days of it I had 150mg/day. I gotta say this is the worst withdrawal I’ve had from this. Seems that it’s getting worse each withdrawal so I’m going to just stop taking it permanently now. First time I came off I didn’t have any real negative effects. Second time I began to get heavy sweating episodes and depression for a week. Third time now (bearing in mind each time I was on it, it was for 4 month stretches) and this isn’t letting up so easily. 


I’m constantly sweating and I can’t feel total joy. Last time I had cold water codeine to help me, this time I’m taking a lot of tramadol; neither helped.  Tramadol is amazing for me. I’ve had some depression but find it makes me absolutely euphoric to the point I find it difficult to sleep as I’m too happy. But currently it’s not able help me. I’m also waking up after 2-3 hours sleep wide awake. That can be useful at times.

Things are slowly improving for me now. Last night was the worst of my life, I couldn’t sleep and it was playing with my mind on top of the powerful depression and anxiety. I was close to going to hospital for a mental health crisis. Instead I polished off 4 tramadols... the last I had after a taper... managed to feel normal again for a good few hours. Then I managed to see my doc when they opened for the morning. 


Been put on a mild antidepressant to combat the lyrica withdrawal anxiety and depression and my opiate is now codeine. Felt scary wiping out my stock though. Lol. Even just for a few hours. It’s been a week since I came off lyrica and I’m still getting sweats and head stuff. According to my other posts here it always takes 2 weeks before I feel normal again.

Wow, Lyrica is something else. I just started taking it a few weeks ago- RX'd 75mg BID off label for anxiety n RLS. Well 75mg did very little so I upped it to 150mg twice a day which made me feel very nice. Energetic yet no anxiety, very at peace but I was also on Klonopin & Percocet.


Long story kinda short I polished off 120 10mg Percs in 7 days being an opiate addict n an ex H junkie. Before this, I had been on Oxy IR 15's for 3 months - the Percs were a step down by my pain mgmt doc to try n taper me off. Didn't work. I ate em all in a week n they were supposed to last a month.


Anyway, I went into opiate wd's n had 90 Tramadol 50's lying around so I started eating shitloads of them plus extra klonopin plus extra lyrica just to keep me comfortable. On Dec. 22nd on day 5 of my wd I ran out of Lyrica. I still had klonopin left n some tramadol. Didn't really help. I had racing thoughts constantly,  weird headache, HORRIBLE ANXIETY & restlessness n couldn't sleep for shit. In fact the ONLY thing that helped was some Red Vein Kratom I had n it was minimal relief. Christmas Day I caved n found some Xanax & 30 150mg Lyricas. I couldn't take the wd anymore. It was a special kind od hell n mind u I've been thru opiate n benzo wd's MANY times over. This shit was worse. There was no comfort! And I would mood swing like crazy, cool one minute n snapping off the next. 


Anyway, now I'm on 150mgs of Lyrica 3 times a day with 1mg Xanax TID as well, at the same times, & 10 grams Kratom twice a day also... This combo is especially lovely. On par with my best Oxy experiences. Lyrica has become my new fuckin DOC. I find it literally shuts my mind's nagging racing thoughts down. It turns all that background noise OFF n just allows me to sail thru the day. It's an amazing drug. It's also extremely addicting, tolerance builds quick as shit n it's very expensive ($200 a month n i have insurance but they don't cover it).


So, sadly I've decided to ask my doc for a high dose of Gabapentin ( like 1800mgs a day) to take instead of Lyrica. This will also help with the wd's that'll come when I stop taking it. I'm not going thru that hell again. I don't care for Gabapentin anywhere near as much as I do Lyrica. If only there weren't so many negatives that went with Lyrica. I fucking LOVE IT but I hate it too. I'm now enjoying my last 4 or 5 days of Lyrica that I have left. I'll really miss it. It makes music sound better n food taste better n sleep so much deeper. THAT'S HOW MUCH I ENJOY THIS CRAZY ASS DRUG. I hate to say it but Lyrica is not made for addicts AT ALL. For ppl who need it for legit pain who have no history of dependence I'm sure it's a godsend. But that ain't me unfortunately. I gotta say goodbye to the Pregab... Sorry for this novel I wrote... I'm buzzing off my last Lyrica dose of the night right now. 

Time to put on some Team Sleep n zone the fuck out. Peace n good luck to anyone who loves this drug as much as I do. Fuckin A.

It's a miracle drug for opiate wd. I used it recently to kick a nasty Oxy habit (180-200mgs a day for 3 months) n it relieves 80% of wd symptoms. It completely eliminates that restless, anxious feeling of crawling out of ur skin, along with restless legs n leg cramps (the 3 worst wd symptoms for me) plus it gives u an appetite & allows u to actually sleep. It also lifted my mood slightly. Yes, I also took Tramadol but basically Trams have no affect on me i guess i lack that liver enzyme or whatever that makes Tram work like an opiate. And I took low doses of Klonopin too (.05mgs every 6 hours). But no doubt it was the Pregab that helped the most cus as soon as I ran out I felt like shit. Only symptoms it didn't help for me were sneezing, runny nose, & fatigue. So, yeah it's a miracle pill for opiate wd's & oh so lovely if u mix it with some kratom just an fyi.

I cycle lyrica or use it when I need it. I have had closed eye visuals more than lsd. It can be trippy. I have gone to 1500 mg which is dangerous and my body had tremors.

So so so! 


This morning on day 7 of full lyrica withdrawal and things are getting worse (in total). Life stuff as well as other medication withdrawals culminate and I feel like I need to go into a coma just to get over this. It’s a living nightmare. Anywho… ! Earlier today I found some old 50mg ones. I took one and everything feels infinitely better! Just 50mg! About 10 days ago my dose was 1200mg/day!


I think to preserve my sanity I’m just going to have to take up these low dosages and begin tapering.

Weird stuff this. Yesterday morning I was looking up how to section myself under the mental health act until I managed to get an emergency appointment with my GP, where I cried like a baby and he told me if it gets worse I can just go to the ER room. I found some 50mg lyrica and took one. Hours later I feel absolutely normal. Maybe high at parts but that could be a reaction to how low I’ve been feeling the past week. I’m a passenger in a car and I’m nodding off... an old effect from lyrica that I used to like in the evenings. It feels very good.


i wake up after 9 hours sleep. I’ve been fighting for just 1-4 hours sleep recently so wow. Didn’t even wake up for a piss.


but in the morning I feel bad again. I took a 250mg codeine cold water. No effect. My skin starts to burn. My mood plummets. I take another 250 CW. Nothing again. I take another 50mg lyrica.


hours later I feel my mood shoot right back up to normal. This stuff is so powerful that even 50mg brought relief and negated 500mg codeine (the most I’ve ever had in a morning). And to think I cold turkey-ed from 500mg lyrica months ago. My plan is to get 25mg lyrica and taper very very delicately with that after coming off opiates first.

How long have u been taking the Lyrica? If over a gram of it at once only got u a little high then I'd say u have a huge tolerance. I'd tecommend taking at least a week off but if you've been taking high doses of it daily for awhile u WILL go into wd's from it. So be aware of that. Tolerance to Lyrica builds insanely fast. If u don't need it for a real medical condition & just want to enjoy it recreationally at high doses then only do it a couple times a week. If u need it for a medical issue too then I don't know what to tell u. You could do what I did. My daily Lyrica intake was getting insane so I asked my doc for some high dose Gabapentin too n he RX'd me 600mg 3× day. So I'm taking a week off Lyrica by using Gabapentin instead. From then on i will only use Lyrica every other week n Gaba every other week. Seems to me to make sense but I could be wrong. So far so good though. Good luck.

I've taken lyrica before years ago but stopped. Now I'm taking for like 7 months or so. I should have a tolerance aswell as I am not sensitive to benzos and other sedatives. So it might not be only tolerance. But I get a nice high from lyrica still, so I will try taking some days off and maybe upping the dose to see how it feels. Thanks

Maybe I'm the only person in the world with this problem. I was prescribed lyrica 75mg last week and had never heard of it until reading about it on here.  I took 150mg about 3 in the afternoon and literally became a zombie for 48 hours.  Not a good zombie either.  A couple of days later, New Year's Eve/day about 3am I tried it again, just to make sure.  It's now 8.30 am 28 and a half hours later and I am only just awake enough to write this.  Dreadful stuff IME.  For all those withdrawing, I couldn't imagine what that must be like and I've had some brutal withdraws.


For anyone taking it for the first time, please follow the advice of other posts and start low.  I hate to think what would have happened if I'd started with even 300mg, but I'm sure it wouldn't have been good.


It's a beautiful day Down Under, the beach is calling my name and, while it's only a 5 minute walk down a really beautiful bush trail - no roads to cross, no cars needed to get there- I'm still to zoned to do anything but go back to bed and sleep!

Definitely your tolerance, seems like past a certain point the true recreational effects simply become far too fleeting to count on unless you take heroic doses.


I had been taking lyrica 75mgs like you, around 5-6 of them in the morning, to combat long-term opiate withdrawal. Works good, but the subjective effects can be pretty subtle. One thing I noticed with gabapentin/lyrica is that I can always tell it has started to kick in when I keep getting the urge to stretch my back and it feels REALLY good to do it. Sadly, it tends to hit me with some major fatigue around mid-day and I take a nap, which always "resets" the buzz and I wake up feeling jonesy again.

I found that tollerance to Lyrica builds **insanely** fast...like after 1-2 days I stop getting that slightly drunk uncoordinated feeling that some people seem to like (I didn't)...after that it seemed to stop doing anything really...maybe a slight anti-anxiolitic effect but that's it...


I didn't have any real withdrawal when stopping like some have described but I definitely felt something...like my appetite was much higher on pregabalin and I struggled to eat for a little while after stopping..and caffeine seems to make me much more agitated..


Interesting they are now going to make pregabalin a class C drug in the UK in a few months (same class as most benzos) due to the amount of people abusing it.. like many things, abuse by a few makes it harder to obtain for those who actually rely on it to function....

Lyrica is already scheduled here (Schedule V, benzos are IV), but gabapentin isn't (yet).

Yeah, I figured probably the US but most countries use either a letter of number (or in the UKs case both ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)) for drug scheduling.


Its ironic that when it first came out and I was given it, they claimed it had no addiction potential and no overdose risk....


Not like big pharma to be wrong about these things is it? ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

I got pregabaline when it came out as Lyrica all those years ago and was on it for some years. I never got any high from it though, I even tried a gram and a half and only felt dizzy. Had no issues quitting it either, sorry to hear many are having such horrible withdrawals from it.

Big Pharma said the same for opiates. About 30 years ago they said in the US that there us ‘simply no risk of addiction or withdrawal as previously thought’. 

I hope the guy who said that now has children hooked in fentanyl.

That youtube video by “BBC Three” on Pregablin is pretty eye opening.

I was put on gabapentin to sort out some nasty lyrica withdrawals. Life’s okay now. But fuck me that was a bad ride. I have never been so close to ending my life before. The last time I came off this I had no real problem barring occasional nightmares and mild anxiety so I don’t think I can ever go back now. It’s spooky weird shit. 


I might get some mild withdrawals coming off this gabapentin but I’m only on 100mg twice a day. Shouldn’t be too hard. 


It’s gonna be an interesting decade or two when the truth about this med comes out. My doc (socialised doc so no payments from drug companies) didn’t know about the withdrawals from this and has began investigations at his university. I want to know the mechanism behind it and how it’s so varied between people.

Truly understanding may never be possible. My personal feeling is that the biggest problem within the pharmaceutical industry (including the doctors who prescribe) is this ‘one size fits all’ attitude where the patient us left to deal with the consequences.

Lyrica was designed as an anti-neuropathy med, but it was discovered by accident that it helps some folks with stress. What scared me is the ‘accident’ part. It worries me that they did years of testing on this drug for neuropathy, then magically we’re buying it for anxiety. My guess is the people who had anxiety- related symptoms were excluded from the original clinical trials. 

Next they’ll prescribe it for sleep. It will be marketed as ‘non-addictive’ and ‘gentle’. The people who take it will start to have strange side effects like feelings of dread and pain in their fingers and toes.

I get prescribed four 300mg gabapentin three times a day for nerve pain but I only take it twice a week and use my other prescription painkiller to manage the pain and I find that those two days are when I accomplish more than the rest of the week I do it to try and not get addicted to them and it seems to work

Ran out of lyrica/neurontin the other day and had some nasty WDs, even though I sort of tapered the last few days due to my dwindling supply. Felt like tianeptine withdrawal, weird head fuck and strange physical symptoms: sweaty, clammy hands and feet, chills, insomnia and a crazy amount of nervous energy.


Shitty, but better than being dopesick. Gotta conserve what I have right now and try and make this more manageable because I'm broke for a long while.

So in 7-10 days you've taken sixteen pills, each 75mg?   So at most like 150mg a day?


Just going on the existence of 300mg pills, I'd say you are well within the therapeutic range, and not likely to get withdrawal.  


You might get crabby the first day without any, but that's not a withdrawal.

Damn, nobody else in here? I ended up running out twice in the last week and had to go about 48 hours without, even with titrating the dose down beforehand as I was running out. Withdrawal is bearable but weird. I get clammy, sweaty palms and feet and constant chills. I can sleep fine so it isn't like full-blown dopesickness, but it isn't a picnic by any means.

You will still have to deal with the opiate withdrawal somewhat in my experience when u cease Lyrica.


Opioids and Lyrica are both tied into the glutaminergic system...so the increased glutamate from opioid Wd u were dulling or reducing with Lyrica will increase again when u cease Lyrica. 


I asked a similar question a few days ago in the Neuroscience forum


I take 75 mg A day but lately 225 because of more pain...I get anxious when I haven't dosed that day...hope I'm not dependent

LucidSDreamr-

When shit hurts and you find something that stops the pain, it is natural to get apprehensive when you know your medicine isn?t coming. That?s not addiction, that?s life. It?s the same emotion  that makes you avoid even walking down the aisle at WalMart with roller-blades after almost breaking your neck the only time you ever tried riding then. 

Some people would say you?re addicted, but I say no. You?re afraid if the pain you?re guaranteed to feel without your prescription. Nobody woukd call Grandma an addict for wanting her diabetes pills right?

Maybe it?s time to investigate alternative treatments Doctors seem inly to want to write presentations

Krakus- Dr says no, but some people have real problems. Just Google Lyrica side effects. Don?t trust the manufacturer, or the guy who prescribed it.

You really have to be your own advocate and decide if the benefits outweigh the potential consequences. I?m tapering off it right now and I?m putting more energy into getting off Pregabalin than opiates or benzos. I have been through withdrawals from all of them and Pregabalin scares me the most.

Some help needed pls


So I got some lyrica and was looking to try it out a starter dosage of 100mg approx. Thing is a mate gave ma a few from his stash but they are Lyrica 300mg capsules. So I emptied the powder from the capsule and it weighed 417 mg. I was expecting it to weigh 300 mg. Is that normal?


Could somebody tell me if this is how it should be? Is that just some sort of filler stuff that gets added I.e. the capsule contains 300mg Lyrica + other necessary powder to help with absorption of something? 


Thanks

The other ingredients are lactose monohydrate, cornstarch, and talc which are used as fillers and also to help delay absorption (Lyrica is a 12 hourly med)

I'm using Pregabalin on my own, not really recreationally, as much as for my GAD, SAD and depression.

It helps me to cope the day, and helps me relief me from my strong anxieties and unrest. 

I don't take that much everyday, it depend on the circumstance - some days I "only" take 600mg.

Spacemantwister- I have done exactly what you are trying.

Pour out the powder. Assume the pile is your whole 300 mg. Use a razor blade to separate into equal piles. Two halves is easier than three thirds, but it?s totally doable. It?s exactly like doing lines of coke, but you really want to be precise about the amounts. The sucky part is licking up the powder. It tastes like chemicals mixed with powdered dogshit. 

FYI. Most people seem to get a ?buzz? around 150mg, and it takes around 2 hours to start working. You may be wiser just to start with two equal piles of dogshit.

Good luck.

That seems a bit pointless... He obviously has accurate scales to know the contents weigh 417mg so he just needs to weigh out 139mg of the powder to give him exactly 100mg of pregabalin.


What's the point in messing on with eyeballing piles of powder and moving bits around with razor blades when he obviously has a set of mg scales?

Kids, none of you has a "milligram scale".  Sure, you can buy something that says milligram, but you need to read the specs.  And then multiply by at least two.  It may say "repeatability 10mg" or similar, but that's the best out there for home use, tested in a permanently dark lunar crater.  


The accuracy is not linear, it's a whole lot worse at the lower end.  You can have confidence that "4.173 grams" is between 4.150 and 4.190, but "173mg" could be 100-200mg, maybe.  Read the specs and it'll be worse.


Real ones cost thousands and when used without a "freeze reading" are obviously still unable to measure a milligram difference.  About 17mg is where I put the limit of reliability on a $4000 balance (again, below 150mg.  much better higher up).  Hygroscopic powders will absorb 50mg of water from your breath looming over them.  


Anyone who sells you something and claims that precision, when not required by a government to be at least that precise, is inaccurate at best.

A cat huh?


I agree though, it isn't accurate to a mg, and weighing it seems extreme anyway with one capsule


Although, taking 2 grams is pretty fucking extreme also-isn't the max dose... oh who gives a flying- point is, that's a LOT. If it is 8x more potent than Gabapentin that is like over 10 grams-which is probably impossible because of inverse dosing, still I couldn't imagine doing such a dose 


Pregablin is supposed to better though, and still more of than just a more potent Gabapentin-IDK for sure though. Still, isn't 2 gram extreme? Desperate bad I would be afraid to take half that much

LoL ..where do you get that from? If he was able to measure a figure of close enough to 417mg within the parameters of the accuracy of his scale then I would imagine he is able to manage to make a  measurement of close enough to 139mg within the same margin of error given the same scale parameters without it going "*horribly wrong*" with a Lyrica capsule 


**WAAAYYYY** less likely to not go  *"horribly wrong"* than with eyeballing piles of powder on a counter top...which is what the original post and subsequent replies are actually about at the end of the day

I never said the pregablin or anything would go horribly wrong, just that a precise scale can still be horribly wrong.  


It's accuracy v. precision, two very different things, and linearity in measurement making smaller masses harder to accurately measure, for a device that might be intended for a 5 gram teaspoon.  Consider a mechanical linkage dead-distance, the amount of play that has to exist in one of these, and how it would have to dwarf whatever would be required for single milligram; then as a percentage of the distance moved by something with a small mass.  IOW, that first 20 or 100mg, the first gram even, might be purely play in the system, not engaging any actual mass, just vibrations.

Exactly this....though I did find Scrofulas rant QI.


On a quick attempt and first go (it's very fiddly playing with powders, capsules and small scales) I managed to divide the powder in 2 near enough exactly. So with some powder lost and converting into Lyrica amounts I made 2 capsules with 142.5mg Lyrica (approx figures rounded up n down) in each, with a loss of 15mg Lyrical.

^ To clarify,'I just though it was a lot of time spent actually weighing a single lyrics capsule-though on second though there is a kind of logic to it, although "precise" and accuracy are two different things- yet people tapering will for example shave pieces off of their Valium tablets for "precise" dosing-hardly hazardous, as would pregabalin, if you want a test dose or precision it makes sense, even if personally if it was just one capsule I would do it the old fashioned way ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


Really, I am more concerned with the person who said they sometimes take 2 grams-is that safe or advisable? That is somewhat equivalent to ~10 grams gabapentin(if you could take that much) So it just makes me wonder, that is more concerning than someone measuring the powder from a single capsule and not being 100% ACCURATE

QI- quite interesting 

I did miss the fact that he has a scale that could possibly just weigh out the dosage. If it works it would be a much better way than my razor blade method. 

LucudSDreamer- the most I took at once was about 600 mg. I am prescribed 300 mg/day and I haven?t gone past that on a daily use basis. But I have gone from nothing to 450 mg in one day and the hangover scared me. I felt like my blood was full of cheap oven cleaner for about 48 hours. I have tried to quit c/t after only about a week?s use at 300 mg/day and had some pretty awful wd?s (insomnia, depression, etc) Also I watched the BBC3 documentary on YouTube about Belfast?s pregablin problem and it scared the crap out of me. 

The razor blade method has helped me taper off it a couple times without having to admit to my Dr that I?m coming off it. There?s too much trouble around here getting a Dr to put me back on the level of medication I was on previously after I have tried quitting to see if the pills are really working. It?s much better if my Dr hears that nothing has changed while I?m shaving pills and building a reserve stash while trying to taper on my own. I got a ton of Lorazepam and Lyrica that way, and I HAD about 3 grams of oxy that way(later wound up needing it and now it?s gone... ? Also, my copayment for a full script is the same $$ as for one pill, so I might as well tell the Dr to write ut for as much as possible and save the rest.

I heard everyone's cackles of derision at the NIST nerd, taking me all the way to fifth grade and  my science fair volcano.  They laughed when I said it would be "somewhat impressive." Then they sued.  I pointed out my volcano mix of ammonium perchlorate with red coke-can aluminum shavings (and some broccoli trees) was merely deflagrant, not explosive, just like I had warned.   The judge agreed, and then they cried.  They always cry in the end.

The highest dose I took so far was 3,5 g in an afternoon.

So far, the highest dose I took regularly was 1500 mg.

I  would like to pinpoint that I am a regular user of Pregabalin, so I  don't feel the same effect as persons taking it the first time,  since tolerance built in.

And, to feel some effect of Lyrica, I have to take at least 750 mg.

Been taking ~400mg once in the morning to get moving for the day. I don't get sick during the day but when I wake up in the morning I feel really cloudy in my head and shitty until I dose. Now I'm out. I have enough gabapentin to get through a few days but something tells me this is going to really hurt...

So I did a trial run of approx 140mg lyrica on Friday.


I could definitely feel effect (somehow strong yet subtle) from this amount. It was a strange day but I think I enjoyed it. When on kratom or even large amounts of Phenibut I can enjoy a nice recreational feeling yet carry out normal day to day activities whilst feeling more upbeat and almost "enhanced". I guessed that the effects of this size dosage of lyrica would be similar in that sense but that wasn't the case.


Rather than feel enhanced I felt more impaired tbh. Sometimes this was enjoyable and sometimes not.


I'm definitely going to try it again at either same or lower dosage. This time I will make sure I don't have too much walking and traveling about to do on that day.

Can I just add, huge grams of Lyrica above 1.5g has resulted in renal failure. I know as I work in renal medicine. Be careful. Dialysis did help and kidney function recovered in the patient but dont be that reckless with doses.

I tried Pregabalin as a potential synergy with vyvanse to smooth out the effects. It completely blocks all of Vyvanse’s positive effects. Made me less motivated, slower mentally, less confident and basically like I had a labotomy. Horrible, horrible thing if anyone wants to live a functional life. Stims all the way for me from now on.

We don't do recommendations like that, Mr. Password. I don't think there'd be any point to it either.


I know pregabalin is faster than gabapentin, but mainly due to absorption from your guts.  But after that, the pleasant buzz seems to take a while.  It's more complex than just a bolus of drug hitting your brain, at least IME.

I?m just curious about others who have used Lyrica. Personally, I?m an opiate girl, I don?t abuse them, but I do live off them. Last time I attempted to get off them (oxycodone) I was given Suboxone (useless) and Lyrica. The Lyrica did not give me a high at all, it basically just made me feel that gross withdrawal jittery feeling, as well as the lack of coordination, but it was in no way a pleasant feeling. I honestly felt similar to when I use marijuana. (Which I?m not huge on either). Is that atypical, or normal? (The feeling I mean, not the not liking it-it?s clear not liking it is atypical.)

Took about a week off from lyrica, and the first dose (~400mg) was great. Wish it could be like this every time. Withdrawal wasn't that bad, honestly.

If you only do it once every three or four days you can get the buzz you?re looking for every time. Problem is tolerance builds so incredibly fast with lyrica.

So I tried Lyrica for the second time couple of days ago. First time 150mg approx then over a week later 200 mg approx.

Tbh I didn't particularly enjoy either experience. I enjoyed the after effects of good mood and relaxation.


During the peak of the 'high' I felt a bit of pressure in my head (similar to that I get when on phenibut), a bit floaty at times but more often I just feel a bit drunk. Not enjoyable drunk but that feeling you have if you have been pretty drunk earlier that day and its been about 4 hours since your last drink and now you're just feeling dozy and clumsy..


So questions:

If I take a much larger dose, of say 400mg, am I likely to feel the more euphoric effects and possibly negate the negative effects I mentioned above? Or will I likely not enjoy it anymore and maybe even feel worse? 


To those who did not initially enjoy the lyrica/pregabalin high and then later discovered they liked it, what changed?


I'm guessing that my best bet at having a good time on Lyrica is to just take smaller doses where I probably won't get a high but perhaps a small mood lift.


Any thoughts?

When I took too much it was exactly like drinking too much. Including the throwing up. You should watch BBC3 Drugs map of Britain: Pregabalin , on YouTube.

May have seen that a year or two ago. Was it about the pregabalin addicts in Northern Ireland? In NI they refer to lyrica as 'buds'. That slang and be careful not to overdo it with lyrica was what I took away from that program ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

That?s the one. Kids calling their dealer for buds. Opening the capsules and snorting it. 

What I took from it is that it is prescribed for problems ranging from nerve pain to emotional stress. Which means you could get it for a back injury abd wind up comitting suicide in withdrawl. 

Tolerance builds fast. Get high on 300 mg today and in three days it can take 900 mg to just get close to the same high. Overdo it  once and you?ll be preying to pass out so the ride can end.

Yeah it's a serious drug that needs respected. 


I always err on the side of caution, especially, with drugs. It's crazy to read how high a dose some people start on or even worse recommend other's take as a starter dose.


I read through most of this lyrica megathread before trying it out and even then I wasn't totally sure what to expect.

After a long period trying pregabalin, now I can say its an acquired taste. The first time I took 300mg and just feel a drunk sleepy effect, it was definetly a worthless trip, the second time I took 900mg and then it felt less alcohol-like  and more like a benzo, but again nothing especial. 

I was about to flush those pills in the toilet until a week after I took 450mg, after a couple hours the good effects of pregabalin bloomed. A soft opiate-like state, now I can say pregabalin has recreational value. But also there are negatives things about pregab:


-The good effect takes time to appear, specially after eating a meal

-You need to find the right dose, more doesnt necessarily means more high, it can mean more side effects

-The tolerance its ridiculous, you have to wait almost a week for its ludic effect, but the analgesic and anxiolitic effects still after daily use in my experience

-Its expensive and addictive, so be careful

It seems to me that lyrics is only good for anxiety. My other half was prescribed lyrics for nerve pain & back pain. 3x75mg, i don't think it did much for helping with the pain but did wonders for his anxiety but can't take it during the day coz he works & it gives blood shot eyes & shite cordination, he was worried about driving, but has no problems driving with 120mg morphine. So I don't know about this drug that's supposed to be a great new drug for nerve pain yet you can't take it during the day if you have to do shite Unless you don't give a shite walking around looking drunk.

As with opiates tolerance plays a big part. I was prescribed 100mg x3 and would either take all 300mg at night or 100mg in the morning before work along with 8-10 grams of kratom and a hit or two of weed and could function fine. Now a couple years later after getting off of daily use 50mg works better for sleep than 15mg temazepam does.

I think you'll get extra high. They aren't like psychedelics where tolerance develops instantly on the initial dose

Depends if your fourteen is every day. If you haven?t had any in a week, then took ten in the morning, then fourteen more in the evening, then you can expect to be extra high. If you do this every day then you?ll probably feel something more, but not much.

Please don't take fourteen pregabalin doses at once.  This is not gabapentin, where you'll just shit out the extra, you'll saturate your brain in this stuff, only getting as high as you would with three doses, make your tolerance skyrocket, wasting this shit and setting yourself up for a nasty withdrawal.

I'm taking pregabalin regularly, for GAD and SAD, in doses up to 1'500 mg daily.


Please, indicate me if there is any alternative for this medication, without the withdrawal issues, or at least with lesser; and with similar effects.


Thanks,

No safe replacement for GABAergics but this will help.

Mr./Mrs. Uncoupling: gabapentin, pregabalin, baclofen, phenibut (and 4F-phenibut, trust me), are not GABA-A receptor ligands (or modulators).  It's contentious that they're even "GABAergic", I've seen a single paper suggest they increase synaptic GABA or affect the transaminase.


Baclofen and phenibut are ligands for GABA-B receptors outside the central nervous system, but a lot of people take these for anxiolysis (aka getting high) and that is mediated through calcium channels.


Krakus:  for SAD, light therapy is probably best.  For GAD, there's cognitive behavioral therapy, and a few hundred different antidepressants out there.  Benzos aren't good long-term, Coupled is right about that, but might be the best option for a panic disorder.

Lyrica/pregabalin is not BENZODIAZEPINE.


I had, and I'm soon ongoing on psychotherapy. Though, It didn't had the same appeasing effect that pregablin has.


Unfortunately, I like and drink often coffee. Can't get out of these espresso's.


On a good side, since I was taking SSRI's and pregabalin, I don't drink that often. Maybe a beer or two in the evening.


Btw., I don't take anymore SSRI's, but still have this SAD and GAD issue.


Thanks,

Krakus

That's why I mentioned 'hundreds" of antidepressants that might or might not work for you.  I'm no fan of SSRIs at all, and for anxiety they're worse than benzos, at least short-term.  Lots of newer, more potent substances, and, actually, there are anti-depressant benzos out there too. 


But it's probably more likely you just have a pregabalin addiction going.


Why the issue with coffee?  Turns out there is more dopamine involvement than I thought with caffeine, but it still doesn't cause "dopamine deficiency" any more than taking benzos causes "GABA deficiency".  GABA is kind of necessary for benzos to work.

Lyrica and I.V Ketamine Infusion equals nurses sort of yelling at you saying ?Sir, it?s time to wake up. I mean I took the combination prescribed as in I had a script for both.  I closed my eyes, went out fast and the nurses had to wake me up. Go easy on this combo.

Im taking 100 mg x 2/day. Yesterday I tried skipping my am dose and I was nauseous by dinner. When I figured out what caused it, I took 150mg and the nausea went away 2 hours later.

I?m going to have to taper. Probably drop 25 or 50 mg / day each week. Sucks opening the capsules though. That powder inside tastes really bad.

I'd suggest dropping 25mg not 50mg. Slower is better. Personally I like the taste of Lyrica so can't help you there. Maybe try mixing it into OJ or something? Good luck on your taper!


anyone else find nicotine greatly enhances Lyrica?

I was rxed Lyrica for chronic pain my body consumed with arthritis.  After 2yrs of 450 per day my body reacted, swollen legs,face, eyes swelled shut, chronic sinus infections. Dr took me off, 75 every other day then stop.  Six days out I am in hell, very dark, extreme pain, 8 lbs gone in 6 days, can’t eat or sleep.  Stay away from this poison prescribed or not.  7thousnd plus ppl onFB survivors page but page not secure.  It screws with your head and body years after.    Don’t play with Lyrica.

I have read a lot about Lyrica. Lots of personal posts and stuff. Its absolutely amazing how widely varied the withdrawl symptoms are. 

Honestly Im fucking scared about coming  off this stuff. I start opiate withdrawls cold turkey tomorrow, then maybe 2 or 3 weeks later I will start on gettIng off Lyrica. Then Ativan.

I have a lot of work ahead.....

The reason I was rxed Lyrica was for it to replace opioids.  Mine were reduced 50% to 40 mg per day. It’s getting difficult to get scrips filled since supply has been reduced 20% twice in 2 years. Still in withdrawal from Lyrica, day 7, but did not wake up crying.  My heart rate is finally below 100 but entire body shakes with every beat.  I have been using prescribed temazepam during day for anxiety.   It’s to be used for sleep. I did not have anxiety before taking Lyrica! 

The full body pain is outrageous, every nerve is waking up.  If I were able I’d be looking for street drugs, anything to stop the pain.  

I am old and just want for it to be over.

Squeaky  I hope you are doing ok with the opiate withdrawal.  It’s so different from the Lyrica.  For me stopping opiates, a long time ago, was more physical with RLS, diarrhea, cravings.  You won’t crave Lyrica when you stop.  I had stopped Lyrica once before and had less withdrawal symptoms.  This second time has made me crazy.  Also, my pain is just the same pain I have had for years except for added muscle pain.  So maybe you will not have major withdrawal from Lyrica..  Don’t anticipate a bad time as that will just increase your anxiety.

I have amazing effect for my social anxiety from pregabalin.


Theory

Like alcohol, **pregabalin is a** **selective  *alpha2delta ligand***. This means that it lowers fear . Benzodiazepines do not do this, they work if you anxiety not fear. Unlike alcohol, is a selective ligand, so much less brain fogg then alcohol.


Real life

If I take 300mg ( not every day, so I have low tolerance) and stay alone I have a subtle high, nice but nothing special.

The magic is with people. It acts as a social lubricant , my fear of people disappear and I act as a different person.


I am considering to take it every day, this time like a medication under the supervision of a psychiatrist.

alpha2delta ligand are still not well understood, I think that in the future pregabalin will be much more used as a treatment for anxiety instead of benzo.

The Lyrica / pregabalin can help you get off both the opiate and benzodiazepine. 


IMO, I would come off opiate then benzo. The slower the better. 


Lyrica / pregabalin may subjectively suck, but, taper your dose down at a reasonable pace and you can jump as early as a week. 


If you are deep into the pregabalin, taper slower. 


This method worked for me. 


Your mileage may vary.

I have LOTS of Lyrica stashed. I dont take as much as they give me.

I tried using for opiate wd but it really only made me feel worse. And it gives me a chemical type of hangover. Feels like alcohol hangover with a taste of chemicals in my mouth the next morning.

I've quitted benzo or ghb cold turkey with zero problem.

I think that phisical addiction to substance acting on GABA receptor is strongly variable from person to person.

Yes , word by word what you say.

But  like benzo ( that I do not like at all) it is not for everyone, it works for someone.

It is the social anxiety thing... it's called anxiety but it is fear, and pregabalin target it.

Haha yeah probably. I also quit GHB and a three or so daily month run with Etizolam with no issues. That's what I'd always say when people asked, just lucky I guess. Many times I'd thought I'd be in hell and the next day I'd be waking up like "Am I WDing?!?!", then think, "If you have to ask your obviously not WDing...". Odd stuff.

I had been addicted to strong opioids for 3 years..I got hold of some prcegablin & they completely killed any form of withdrawal. I took 600mg a day for a week and am now clean of opiates. The high is great and calms you down and releases all anxiety. I would advise this to anyone who is having problems with opiate addiction.

Please be aware that Lyrica withdrawl sucks for those that go through it. 600mg per day is the max daily dose iirc. Although sometimes I do go over that lol :D.

Anyone knows what's the best someone could take while on pregabalin withdrawal? I have been researching but I don't really know how to go about it. I have baclofen, phenibut, clonidine and diazepam. I maybe can try to get gabapentin, but I don't know if I will manage or if it is just too cross tolerant to fix the issue. I really don't want to switch one addiction for another. Should I maybe mix clonidine with baclofen, or take a different compound everyday? On what dosages? Or should I take one of those in combination with pregabalin and tapper further?

TH - Are you in fear of running out of pregablin? If not then how about raising your dose to a more comfortable level, then taper veeerrry slowly.

My Dr did  recommend to me to switch to gabapentin to get off Pregablin, but I never tried it.

No, my issue is not running out, problem is I find tappering extremely difficult, because I really like pregabalin and if I don't take a dose much superior of what I need to avoid withdrawal I don't feel it. I have quite a stressful life right now so it is very easy to find excuses to take a bit more, would love to have the kind of will power to control myself for months, unfortunately I haven't. To be tappering for months I think it is a utopia for me, and I think pregabalin requires extra slow tappering if you want to avoid symptoms. 

Besides, as I said I just don't feel pregabalin once I take it daily, so to be on it just to avoid withdrawal without feeling it seems pointless to me. I got down to 75mg twice a day with great effort and I am jumping to nothing in a few days. Just would like to know if anybody has used bacoflen, diazepam, phenibut, clonidine or even gabapentin for withdrawal and how it went. I have used just diazepam in the past and it helped but not a lot. Same for opiates. But the comedown of opiates made things worse.


Do you think with gabapentin I would reduce withdrawal symptoms or just avoid the withdrawal and have to face it once I stop that? I found mixed info, so I don't know to what extent they can be considered the same drug in terms of addiction. In any case, for what I read sounds like a good option to switch to gabapentin if you want to do it slowly.


Baclofen and clonidine sound like the best options for what I read. Around 0.1mg clonidine 3 times a day or much more than that depending on source, and I haven't found info on baclofen dosage or the posibility of mixing both. Took yesterday 10mg baclofen to try and felt nothing.

[http://www.clevelandclinicmeded.com/medicalpubs/pharmacy/septoct2005/pregabalin.htm](http://www.clevelandclinicmeded.com/medicalpubs/pharmacy/septoct2005/pregabalin.htm)


This is an excellent discription of how pregabalin/Lyrica works and raises some questions.


One of the main things I was looking at was according to The Cleveland Clinic, 50 mg pregabalin equals 300 mg of gabapentin.


50 mg pregabalin = 300 mg gabapentin.


In the last 1.5 hours , 900 mg of pregabalin was ingested on an empty stomach.


So does that equate to 5.4 grams of 

gabapentin?


I am feeling pretty nice atm.


This also makes me give more thought to stacking Lyrica ala Gabapentin, as in

75 mg - 150 mg Pregabalin every 1-1.5 hrs.


This is completely subjective, but when I stack Pregabalin @ 150 mg, every 1-1.5 hrs, I feel the peak lasts longer.


This dose was taken after a two week clear out of pregabalin. 


Thoughts?

It is a decent medication. It is perscribed easier because it works well without major side effects.


Let?s remember that doctors have many ways of checking your usage. 


This is a great medication if used correctly.


I?ll post more when I have the correct information,  but I?ve read about qt interval being  prolonged

That is serious.


[https://duckduckgo.com/l/?kh=-1&uddg=https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/QT_interval](https://duckduckgo.com/l/?kh=-1&uddg=https%3A%2F%2Fen.m.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FQT_interval)


^^ This is the basic Wikipedia explanation.

This is something to consider.

Smart money with pregabalin for recreational use, at any level, is to never use two days in a row. Better more like once a week. Tolerance builds faster than anything, and sometimes withdrawls can be life altering. 


SpeedKing- I have found those calculators to be extremely useful, particularly when I have little experience with a medication. However the exact reason I was given pregablin was because I didnt respond at all to gabapentin. My Dr told me that this is how they prescribe for diabetics:  gabapentin first because there are generics ( thus cheaper). If it doesnt work, then Lyrica(pregablin) She said that if one doesnt work, the other obe usually does. Based on that, your best move might be to use that conversion calculator to try an evening on only gabapentin at what would be the equivalent dosage and see where it takes you without any pregablin. Then you can try mixing and matching.


Also, the link you listed in your last post must have been wrong. Could you check and post it again? Thx

Yeah I cant stress enough how important it is to leave days between uses. The more days the better. But in the end tolerence builds and even leaving a few weeks youll never have those first few weeks of use, that bliss, that loss of inhibition. Now I just take it for pain. It doesnt do jack for me anymore in terms of euphoria.

Well, my withdrawal is quite weaker than I predicted. The tapering helped a lot reducing it. Those mini withdrawal symptoms I was suffering during tapering were half of the bill.


My impression is that baclofen and clonidine helped, especially clonidine makes me super sleepy, that stuff knocks me down, not for long but I managed to get 4 hours sleep on it. Better than diazepam that helped too to a smaller degree. I would say baclofen during the day, from 30mg up per 2 or 3 a day. And clonidine to sleep. 100ug was surprisingly enough for me, I think I am super sensitive to the stuff. Keep in mind that my withdrawal was very weak, you might need to up those dosages quite a lot in a serious withdrawal and I don't know how well it would go.

I've been a long time admirer of pregabalin since my discovery of it 3-4 years ago. Lyrica and all its incredibly cheap generic versions are OTC at any pharmacy nation-wide here in Egypt.I started to experiment with it extensively and found out a few things time after time. First of all, always gotta be careful with dosing because for me, it used to cause some myoclonic jerks that can get violent whenever I take 1.5 grams in a single dose with a clean body. Another thing is, Pregabalin is one HELL of a mixing drug. I've tried it with every substance I've had access to and it really is beautiful. smoking weed while approaching the peak can be an almost psychedelic, extremely euphoric experience. It's just great with everything from DXM and weed to opiates as it not only adds to the experience but it alters it to make up a relatively new one. Lyrica is also great when respected because if you take a single high dose occasionally it won't hook you and you'll have long years of beautiful occasional weekends with it. A simple but annoying thing too is that when you take a high dose (all my doses are on a total clean tolerance and empty stomach and are upwards of 900mg) and you get very sleepy but don't wanna let it go just yet, you'll enter a state of hypnagogia where, if someone were to wake you up because you're passed out sitting up in front of your laptop for example, you'll be unconscious but responsive and are very likely to act like a hallucinating idiot. I'm sure there's other things that I don't recall at the moment but overall, Lyrica is a beautiful drug with a huge recreational potential because it's very safe relative to most recreational substances, not addictive unless you got deep issues and just want whatever pill to numb you a bit, very very euphoric and even more if used in the right setting, very empathic and lowers your inhibitions whilst stimulating you too all at the same time.

Speed King, I'm totally into the idea that you've presented regarding the stacking of Pregabalin (Lyrica). Those of us who have experience with Gabapentinoids know all about the nature of Gabapentin (Neurontin) and how it follows a strange bioavailability  pattern. You can only absorb so much Gabapentin. In my experience there is a definitive limit. I have ingested literally dozens of grams of Gabapentin with high tolerance and felt basically nothing. So, if you have a very high tolerance to Pregabalin or another Gabapentinoid, it could actually be impossible to experience any effect whatsoever. Too much of my life has been dedicated to understanding this strange drug. 


So, I guess what I'm saying, is that, yea, you have ingested that equivalent dosage, but at the same time that dosage would probably be impossible to be fully absorbed. I would like to note that when I take Pregabalin in a very high dose, with no tolerance, I can experience severe Myoclonus (jerking movements). If I ingest a small amount, say, 150mg as you've said, I can then dose as high as I want without experiencing any Myoclonus and furthermore, get this, if I do take enough to initiate these Myoclonic movements, if I take more Pregabalin, even the next day or the day after, I will continue to experience Myoclonus until the Pregabalin has completely cleared and I try again a few days later. It's such a goddamn mystery.


I would be very interested in hearing from others who have experienced this, as it appears to be a fairly rare side effect. Most prescribers I've talked to are unaware that this is a possible side-effect. Also, and this one can really fuck you over good, they seem to be essentially unaware that there is a severe (or any) withdrawal syndrome from Gabapentinoids, when in reality, the withdrawal appears to be akin to Benzodiazepine withdrawal, in that it can make you totally non-functional and turn  your life into a living nightmare. I'm sure you've all read stories about Phenibut (OTC Supplement) and the horror stories.


I believe, actually, that the Phenibut Diaries, as it were, are some of the best resources for predicting the outcome of dependence, tolerance and withdrawal from the other Gabapentinoids. Why? Phenibut is pretty cheap and can be bought over the internet by the pound. This allows us to see what would happen if one had a truly limitless supply of these drugs. The stories people tell sound downright nightmarish. Gabapentin is self-limiting, as we have said but who has an endless supply of Pregabalin? Not most people. If we examine peoples' experience with Phenibut, I think we can draw a reasonable comparison and predict how Pregabalin might work.


Check this one out as a point of reference, but a simple Google search turns up a litany of horror stories concerning the substance. Even the people who sell it provide a guide to withdrawal.

Keif. Yes I've noticed if I dose my normal dosage (150mg) then wait an hour I can avoid the adverse reactions of high dose Lyrica. I'd also like to know the reasoning behind this, but best I can figure is that the normal dose binds the receptors allowing for a higher ceiling dose. I don't really get the twitches anymore though. I think it's because my body has become used to the Lyrica.

No big mistery too:

 " Gabapentin  is a non-metabolized adrug that is eliminated by renal excretion and *displays saturable, dose dependent absorption*. Gabapentin bioavailability is not dose proportional; i.e., as dose is increased, bioavailability decreases. Bioavailability of gabapentin is approximately 60%, 47%, 34%, 33%, and 27% following 900, 1200, 2400, 3600,4800 mg"

I don?t get what you are trying to say. 


There has been plenty of discussion in this forum if stacking pregabalin was worth it/possible/effective. 


I know what I think and have experienced.

I wanted fresh answers to that subjective question from fresh folks. 


You noticed  I said pregabalin and not gabapentin right?


Although they may share similarities, they are quite different.

How do Gabapentin, Baclofen, and Pregablin compare for the purposes of increasing sleep quality due to a sleep disorder? I know that GHB/Xyrem is king but it's very difficult to get prescribed whereas the other three as easy.

I have confirmed that this shit fucks your urinary system up somehow.  A listed side effect is disurea (painful urination/bladder pain).  I probably have some other conditions from the poly drug use but after a couple years of taking this shit.  Now when i even take just one pill i get bad pelvic pain.  Many reports all over the internet of the same thing from peolpe that never abused drugs. 


Now i have so many bottles of lyrica i will never touch again ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)

I have been having a lot of trouble pissing, and pain in my pelvis, specifically at my SI joint. I wonder if Lyrica could be the cause. 

I have been  trying to get off it. I had been down to 50 mg/day, but one of the wd symptoms I get is nausea and I end up every day taking 100 mg to combat the sickness. I might just try to go cold turkey in a couple of weeks and see if I can get past the wds.

My wife and i actually did have a near endless supply of pregabalin. we had thousands of them at one point; someone with whom we were living had been prescribed a decent amount of lyrica for several years but never took it and didn't care about it. we discovered the wonderful effects of high lyrica doses and both took it fairly regularly.


I, too, experienced myoclonus most of the time but thought that it was ok, as did my wife.


Eventually, however, she had a seizure that nearly killed her while on it: she stopped breathing for a few minutes. Then, she continued having a ridiculous amount of involuntary twitching, from head to toe: limbs, fingers, eyelids. This went on for a couple of days. She was unconscious during this time and experiencing Status Epilepticus.

I was afraid she wasn't going to wake up and the dr prepared me for the possibility that she might have been permanently catatonic.

She DID come to after a few days, thank god, but the damage was done: she was a different person.

She only said "yes" and "no" for about six months. She didn't remember a WHOLE lot of her life. And her personality completely and utterly changed: she was once fiery and ambitious and sharp and confident; now she is docile, passive, demure, introspective.

It's taken a few YEARS for her to get back to normal, but again, it ISN'T exactly normal because she has a new personality. 

Her intelligence eventually came back though.


She never told me that pregabalin had been involved in that episode, so i kept taking it.

Eventually, i had an INSANELY violent seizure myself. I fell back on my leg in such a manner that i had to use a walker for a couple of weeks.

I was also generally confused for a few weeks. It felt as though i had slipped into a parallel dimension.


Pregablin is a wonderful feeling, but it literally nearly took my wife from me forever and had some pretty rough adverse effects on me, too.


I don't know what causes this shit to happen: predisposition to seizures, length of time using it, amount taken, combination with other drugs: i really have no fucking idea. But i can tell you one thing: the jerking movements precede seizures. 

If anyone is getting the involuntary jerking movements, she may want to consider backing off for awhile and lowering her dose.


When people talk about this drug being safe, i feel that i would be remiss not to share this story.


I wish to god it hadn't happened this way though: i fucking LOVED taking it.

If it is your first time using you are safe no matter how much you have been using. Once you get a withdrawal it will appear again much more easily so try to avoid the first one. Twice a week is the most I would recommend, and once a week much better.

If you are familiar with opiates withdrawal you know the score. Same story but to a lesser degree. Trying to avoid same issues that took you to opiate withdrawal will take you to pregabalin withdrawal. Not very scientific but I think you have a +90% probabilities of experiencing a pregabalin withdrawal at one time or another.

Your situation is bad and lots of us can relate to it. Note you said "...nothing to look forward after...", that's the REAL problem not drugs. Drugs are just not effective medication long term for the problem. 

Positive thing is we know we need to do something meaningful to reverse that, negative thing is that it can be difficult to find such a thing. Some things you might look into are family, friends, career, education goals, hobbies and physical and mental health. If any of those areas are bad and fixable, you could try to take action towards improving it. If any of these areas seems overwhelming at the moment just ignore it and maybe just focus in an area you feel you can improve... maybe physical condition or other, and be patient.


In any case, I would choose a pregabalin addiction over an opiates addiction any day of the week. And with the crazy tolerance of pregabalin it makes it a very difficult drug to be addicted long term, you'll have to face the problem sooner than later.


As a last thought, the problem is not using. It is using to avoid bad emotions, feeling void...Basically neuroticism

What takes us too use in the first place is curiosity and that is not bad, that's just openness, the problem is to start swapping your discipline and strenght for weakness and boredom...


...and I am talking to myself, I think I know the way but still I cannot follow it. Deep enough I know I have to be patient and perseverant. Though sometimes I doubt if I just have the resources...probably everyone doubts...


Sobriety forever might not be the answer for some of us. I've seen disciplined men doing things right and not avoiding getting high. Question is if there is anything different intrinsicaly from them, or we are actually deciding.

Withdrawal sucks but it isn't unbearable. I think withdrawal is more reliant on how long/consistently you have been dosing as opposed to the size of the individual dosages. I went several months taking borderline-heroic doses of lyrica and neurontin, and when I ran out things certainly sucked for a couple of days, but I was able to sleep every night, if that helps put it into context with opioid withdrawal (where you wouldn't sleep even if you were dead).

The thing is I dont know the problem.I have a great job well paid a loving wife three kids I love more then anything.I was a functioning addict through thirteen years of opiate use everything seems good in my life.Im not a drinker never liked the buzz much.But I even tried drinking to try and be normal but two shots a day would turn to three then half bottle then a bottle.Its the boredom I can't handle plus its just so easy to get hold of whatever drug I want.Thirteen years of opiate use I would never buy all of my drug from one dealer would buy most from one and some from others.Just incase my main dealer had none I would be able to get from others.Im trying to find away I can use something as a weekend use thats not a opiate because I can never use that recreationally.

Well, then maybe you are not so bad. Maybe you just need your little holidays on the weekend, I have seen worst habits than that one. Don't you like other families of drugs like dissociatives or psychedelics? You could do a benzo weekend, a pregabalin weekend, a disociative weekend and a psychedelic weekend and probably have a hell of a life.


You can as well find other hobbie for the weekends,...everything is allowed.

The only reason I used lyrica was for anxiety of opiate wd was a wonder drug for wd.But now I enjoy the high and calmness I get from it.Did not use it today after 4 day binge and felt ok not great but not that bad either.The other thing is when I use lyrica I won't get any cravings or thoughts about using a opiate.Im 42 and I have all these ideas about having a drug free life but the reality is I crumble and that goes out the window as soon as I get home.Ilike to smoke a joint but the stupid road side drug test they brought in here in the uk means I could smoke a joint today and still be done for drug driving tomorrow.That would mean loss of my job.This all started when I had my first line of crank on my 15th birthday when living in yuba city California and has been  me using some drug or other for 27 years.

Im sorry if it seems like im moaning and feeling sorry for my self when there are people on here that has led a drug problem to cause so much devastation to there lives.I was just able to keep myself functioning during my use.But I just can't stop feeling so miserable and shame at how I have not got the willpower to not use.Why can't I be like most people who go home maybe have a scotch before dinner and be happy at that.

I think you are being far too hard on yourself. That idea of a drug free life sounds like a utopia you don't want. Pregabalin is a nice drug. You have a life in order it seems to me. So you just need to enjoy it and be careful. People like us who like to change their conciousness are better off if they change with what they do it. If you specialize in one drug I think it is much worse.

Thanks mate to tell you the truth I have been thinking of going to a psychologist for a little while now.Will look for a good one but I think my main problem is that after a hard day of work I always had opium to go home to and chill me out and truthfully I just like being high.Since I been using opium I no longer like stimulant drugs and lyrica is the closest I get to the calming effect I got from it.Thanks for your words of support and advice friend and I hope you keep being the optimist.I will seek professional help and a psychologist has to keep things confidential so won't go on my medical record because I have to have a medical for work.

Thats my plan alternate my weekend use between Benzes one weekend and lyrica the next it will give me something to look forward to all week.That way I can cope the work week.When I was trying total abstinence I always had opiates on my mind.This way I find it easier because I know I will have my release come the weekend I just have to make sure weekend use dont spill into Monday and Tuesday like it did this weekend.So looks like a valium or tamazepam this weekend.

I have always believed that everyone is addicted to something. It can be alcohol, weed, sex. Or it can be exercise, veganism, religion, etc. Some addictions are acceptable, some are a death sentence. 

To me it seems you have to find an addiction that solves the main problem (boredom, back pain, screaming children) but also fits into your life. My grandma can smoke pot because she doesn?t drive and is retired, but I need something that is out of my blood by morning because I have to drive at work. The day I retire Im going to become a pothead!

So we either take up long distance running, or become a craft-beer connoisseur.  All along trying not to go bankrupt buying expensive running shoes or avoiding a drunk driving arrest. And if you can find something that is somewhere between societys cracks of stigma and legality, then you are golden.

Nobody is considering yet that Lyrica can be used for fun. Prescriptions are easy to get, there are a dozen reasons to take it, and it?s not a problem if you test positive for it. 

If you have a good way to keep yourself on track and not overuse it, then I say it cannot be worse than scotch or religeon. Just take it easy. Dont be irresponsible with your kids or job. Dont spend your whole paycheck on it. Dont crash your car when high on it. Plan your usage a couple of days in advance to keep your tolerance under control. And have a solid plan for withdrawl. 

You need SOMETHING. Life is hard. If you cant use Lyrica smartly, then pick something you can. Good thing about Lyrica is that od-ing is hard, and withdrawls are short.

Love a weed buzz but like you can not lose my license.And after 13 years of opiate use dont like stimulants unless I can use opiates to bring me down so that a no go.I enjoy a lyrica buzz so will use that but like you said use it for no more then a few days in a row.Also will do lyrical one weekend and Benzes the net and not use during work week if it was not for the dumb fuck drug driving laws concerning weed where I could be done for a few joints I had the day before my problem would be solved.

Hi sorry this is a reply to your post from many years ago. I have never come across anyone who got the effect you're describing from pregabalin. I get exactly the same effect you describe from 1000mg. It feels (when I shut my eyes) like I push through into a 4th spatial dimension. Then the imagery is so lucid and vibrant, it can be anything, and I can look around at will and examine everything up close. I love it. Best part, no comedown whatsoever and I get the best sleep ever. However one problem, because I've been on it for years I know first hand the withdrawal is HORRENDOUS. Worse than opiate withdrawal in a sense. But I doubt I'll ever have to fully come off it now as I've major nerve issues and so many spine problems I won't bore you with. Protip .... amazing drug if you like being relaxed rather than stimulated .... just be aware long term use causes serious dependency and associated withdrawal.

Quick(ish) question.


I used pregabalin to self-medicate anxiety for a while, a few years ago. Doses around 300-400mg a day. Not every day. 2 or 3 times a week. Eventually after a few months I got a withdrawal from this, which was pretty nasty, a week of feeling really depressed.


Later on, I went on pregabalin legitimately on the NHS, for anxiety. The tolerance came quickly with using the same dose everyday so it stopped working quickly. I started to come off it. Withdrawal was not too bad because I tapered. But then I had some unrelated health problems, which stopped me in my taper, so I stayed on a small dose (75mg per day, 25mg in the morning and 50mg at night). I have been stable at this dose for about two years.


I am now suffering again- intermittently- from anxiety and exhaustion. I'm trying not to gain a tolerance and withdrawal to any particular medication I use. If I feel a bad period coming on, which is maybe once a month or once every two months, I will alternatively use diazepam or amitriptyline for 1-2 days. This works well for improved mood, sleep and relaxation; it gets me out of the hole I'm in. I want to add pregabalin to this as a third option, in order to stop tolerance building to the other two i.e. I will alternatively use diaz, ammy or preg- not combining them. (Bear in mind, I am still taking pregabalin at a very low daily dose which does nothing except keeps me out of withdrawal). 


My question is, if I was to up my pregabalin dose for one day or maximum two, then do a quick taper back down to my current daily dose which I am stable on, would I risk withdrawal again? Because I know from past experience of drugs, once you've had one withdrawal, it's much easier to get that second. What about if I literally just did it once every four months, say? I've not had a problem with psychological addiction to preg or diazepam, I wouldn't say. It's just something to help with anxiety and exhaustion when my schedule becomes too much, really.


Hope that makes sense.

You might find that skipping days of 75mg Lyrica again is not as difficult as you think. With diazepam and amitriptyline skipping days or maybe morning doses then reducing the nightly doses isn't nearly as big a chore as 400mg a day. If you start feeling off then amend the taper of course. You're not going to increase the kindling effect from just feeling off or anxious for a couple hours until you add a little more lyrica or diazepam. 


Special occasion dosing at the interval you mentioned shouldn't mess with your abstinence at all either, at the worst maybe add some light diazepam the following day or day after if you notice that butterfly feeling in your chest. If you can end the daily 75mg maintenance doses the lyrica will work better and at much lower doses.

There is so much egregious misinformation in this thread that it would be impossible for anyone who is thinking of playing around with pregabalin to know what they are signing up for.

I have taken pregabalin 1200mg/day for 11 years at bedtime to eliminate the flashbacks associated with PTSD and daytime GAD.

I understand everyone responds different physiologically to medications and there are some insightful anecdotal posts in this thread.

Let's simplify things.

Pregabalin

neuropathic pain (Peripheral neuropathy eg.) excellent

anxiety disorders - excellent

complex PTSD - excellent

alcohol, opiate, benzo, kratom withdrawal -excellent

seizure control as part of of cocktail of meds -excellent

fibromylagia - excellent

RLS - excellent

Migraines - excellent

beneficial sleep architecture compared to benzos

Potentiates most depressants, empathogens, and some stimulants.

The pharmocokinetics are way too complicated to explain in lay terms but consider it as a gaba analogue.

Rapid tolerance to initial euphoric experience at high doses.

Oral bio-availability reported to be over 90%.

Well insufflation definitely increases the effects for me. 

I think they just lied about that to reduce abuse potential in the same way big pharma lied that nalaxone when combined with buprenorphine  has any effect on reducing misuse of other opiates.

Safe to prescribe up to 7 grams a day under medical supervision.

The effects are not linear. 

4 grams is not twice as strong as two grams.

It's such an interesting profile and can effect people differently at different doses.

After tolerance develops chemical dependency has occurred which IS NOT the same as addiction. 

300mg might blow someone's skirt up and others may need a gram or more for recreational use.

Adding 1g to an earlier dose of 3 grams is a waste. Taking 500mg on its own after tolerance has subsided might rock your world.

After 11 years of 1.2 grams a day (this drug literally saved my life as it was the only thing that could address my PTSD symptoms and allow me to function without always trying to kill myself.) 

I was in and out of voluntary psychiatric institutions for 25 years plagued by an inability to sleep and constant suicidal ideation

I am not concerned that I am chemically dependent on this stuff as it has worked beautifully for 11 years and I have never needed to increase my initial dose/prescription. It is my insulin with no disrespect to individuals with diabetes.

It also allowed me to jump off a three year buprenorphine (suboxone) habit at 2mg without tapering and experienced ABSOLUTELY NO WITHDRAWAL OR PAWS.

I have often forgotten to take my meds on holiday and my flashbacks explode in my head about two nights later, but I have never felt any physical symptoms of withdrawal going cold turkey from 1.2G per day. YMMV.

I can actually get by on 900 mg/night so I often make a little cache over a few months and have a little bender now and then. 

To do so, I need to abstain for at least ten days and then I am high as a kite at the 2g mark. Trying to recapture the feeling the next day with another 2 grams is a complete waste of time for me. 

Sometimes my arms twitch so much that I will involuntarily launch a coffee cup I am holding across the room. Irritating but not unpleasant.

So save up for a rainy day if you can, make sure your tolerance has bottomed out and then go to town!

Abrupt discontinuation may result in debilitating withdrawal and risk of serious seizures.

High doses will cause muscle twitching

I feel so sorry for those individuals who report that pregabalin has either stopped working for them or has started to exacerbate psychological issues. I wonder if some of them have played around with the stuff recreationally too often. I don't know.

YMMV my 2 cents

Balladry is one of the most strongest and calming agents I've taken so far. City water seems in the way tho... So I am sq rewed, it could the the water why half this stuff isn't working. It only worked 1 time and after drinking 16 ounces of city water it completely diminished, and statistically it seems possible.

I found a list of DEA schedules for all drugs with dates when they became controlled (USA only). It goes back a few decades. Kind of interesting for anybody who cares:

Yeah, I gained a significant amount of weight for the first time in my life when I took Lyrica for a few years - about 20lbs or so. It also causes water retention so it can make you look heavier that way as well. Only other medication that made me gain weight like that was mirtazepine. It fell off pretty quickly without any effort once I quit.


I was taking the maximum dose of 600mg per day though, so the more typical lower doses may not be so bad.

I've not read all of the posts on this megathread but just a point about pregabalin capsules... I wouldn't think of IVing them, better things to do that with but I tried snorting (insufflating) them and it works if you like pregabalin, opinions seem to vary widely on it's recreational value but I think it's fairly useful occasionally. I only snorted it because after reading that there's all sorts of other crap in them so bad idea to inject or bother snorting I emptied out a capsule onto some fairly accurate scales and the 300mg capsule emptied out weighed in at 0.35g or roughly 350mg so there's not much else in there if anything. So I'd say snorting isn't the worst idea if you like the drug but if you want to IV then get something else that's meant for Iving IMO... don't how much of this has already been covered so sorry if going over points already mentioned... stay safe and enjoy life x

Forgot to talk about effects...

There can be a wide range og effects depending dosage and other factors, can be quite unpredictable sometimes. Low doses are more activating and almost stimulant-like sometimes, while the higher you go the more opiod-like or even dissociative-like it can get. In any case those are vast comparations and pregabalin  has its own personality and many faces. It is quite a drug!

Great advice from The Hypnotist. 150-250 mg w no previous tolerance is great. Will make you extra social if you are up on your feet. Make you sleep like a baby all night if you lie down. Takes about 2 hours to start. Feels a bit like alcohol for me. Tolerance builds the first time you take it, but also drops to near zero once off it for a few days. 


Dont get greedy. Twice as much does not equal twice as high. Dont take more than 400 mg the first time - first day- or you will only be wasting it and setting yourself up for a dirty hangover (feels like your whole body is covered with bug spray on the inside). You wont get to enjoy it if you pass out, unless sleep is your goal.


If this is to help withdrawals, spread out your dose through the day. I like to do it on an empty stomach so I can feel it start to work.  Maybe 100 mg every 8 hours.  If this is for fun then take it all at once, around 1 1/2 hours before the party.

I started taking lyrica for nerve pain about 6 months ago on low doses. Fixed my pain but then read u can get high with larger doses. I started taking 300 mg in the afternoon it kicked about 2 hours later and felt very relaxed and peaceful. I am now taking 900mg in one dose to get the same effect. The tolerance built up really fast. I want to stop but am scared about the side effects. I have depression and anxiety and am taking lexapro and lithium for that. I don't want to get more anxiety and paranoia. Should i confess to my doctor what i have been doing and will they give me something to help withdrawals. What drugs would help withdrawal. I need help, i'm fucked up. ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)

You should talk to your doctor mate but the one th8ng most people say is taper of it don't stop suddenly.I can feel for you but chasing the lyrica high not worth it you will get to a point when no matter how much you take you won't get the high.I have wd from opiates and am just feeling better from lyrica wd but for me the lyrica wd was more of a headfuck wd but opiate wd was worse.Go to your doctor but don't just stop lyrica s7ddenly your anxiety will creep back.Saying that the first week the hardest with no noticable difference but then it eases.Dont get scared mate I was tak8ng shit loads of 300 mg capsules in binges untill it would stop work8ng then stop for a week.

No cold turkey off Lyrica. The depression will kill you. You can taper safely in a week or so. Come up with a plan for 7-10 days. Write down every dose. Stick to it. You will be fine.

Thanks guys, have now been told i have to go to hospital for an op in 2 days time. So i took 600mg today instead 900mg will see what happens. Hopefully the pain meds at the hospital might ease the lyrica withdrawals. Gotta be careful not to get a dependance on them, been there done that before. I might try and make a resolution to myself not to go back to the lyrica after my week in hospital. Wish me luck 8(

Yes, it's approved for GAD here in Europe. I was prescribed Lyrica for GAD some 10 years ago, by time it was upped to 600 mg (2 x 300 mg) / day. It worked quite well (although I also was prescribed clonazepam and some SSRI I can't remember) but I quit it after some years because it seemed to affect my cognitive skills negatively a bit.


Nowadays I just use it for recreation, today I've taken 2400 mg. The tolerance you get to it is insane, and I have quite some tapering to do after abusing it for a few months. I seem to get these Lyrica binges that can last for days or weeks or like now for months. Every time I have to do the same taper to avoid the nasty withdrawal you get from this stuff. I just never learn. It's great fun every now and then but nasty when you get hooked on it.

Could you post your taper schedule here? I get horrible insomnia, depression, and some nausea. Unfortunately I got to using Lyrica for the last few months too and I want yo quit, but I havent because I dont want to deal with the wds.

I get those symptoms too. Last winter I CT'd from a daily dose of around 1200-1800 mg (yes, my doses tend to grow quite extreme due to the tolerance building up heavily) because I ran out of supply. I got horrific anxiety and depression, alternated between complete and utter lethargy and complete overstimulation, complete insomnia, diarrhea, vomiting and nausea. Combined with a marked increase in heart rate and BP.


I can give advice regarding my tapers but please don't take this as some kind of medical advice, and we are all different and react differently.


When I've used such high amounts (like now) I usually start the taper from 900 mg. I haven't found any need to start the taper from something like 1500 mg or 1800 mg. 900 mg has always been enough to keep the worst WD at bay and sleep somewhat normally.


Usually, I reduce the dose every 4th day by 150 mg, but for some every 7th day may be needed.


So from 900 mg, it would look like this

900 mg x 4 days

600 mg x 4 days (this step I usually cut the dose by 300 mg, for some it would be better to stay at 750 mg for 4-7 days).

450 mg x 4 days

300 mg x 4 days

150 mg x days (this is where it gets hard, so I sometimes stay at 150 mg for 7 days)

75 mg x 4 days

So this taper would take 24-27 days.


Some people even reduce from 75 mg -> 50 mg -> 25 mg but I have never found a need for that. 75 mg is such a small dose that you really don't get any severe withdrawal at that point anymore.

A more cautious version of my taper schedule is to reduce by increments of 75 mg; 750 mg -> 675mg -> 625 mg ->  575 -> 525 -> 475 -> 425 -> 375 -> 325 -> 275 -> 225 -> 175 -> 125 -> 75 (and from 75 with increments of 25 to 50 and then 25). This would obviously take considerably longer. 


There are few remedies for pregablin withdrawal. Benzos alleviate some, but only some, symptoms. And if you do take benzos, take them vary sparingly. As you probably know, they are a completely different ballgame to withdraw from. Gabapentin most probably share a cross tolerance with pregabalin, as both are gabepentinoids with pretty much the same method of action. That's why I would avoid taking gabapentin. There is a study that says there is no cross tolerance between gabapentin and pregabalin (e.g. this study) [https://patents.google.com/patent/EP1196160B1](https://patents.google.com/patent/EP1196160B1)), IME they share a very high degree of cross tolerance. Although gabapentin is both less potent and weaker in just about every aspect, it might be easier to switch to it when you've reached a lower dose of Lyrica and then continue the taper with gabapentin. But I have to admit that trying to switch to gabapentin has failed every time; gabapentin helps somewhat with the insomnia but not for the anxiety and depression.


On another note, I've found Taurine to help quite a bit with the anxiety. It's a (very) weak GABA-A agonist and has a slight sedative effect in high doses. And it's very safe to take it. Other than that, there's not many other drugs that may help. For insomnia, a small dose of mirtazapine (7.5 mg) and a high dose of melatonin (6-10 mg) does also help somewhat for the insomnia. I'm not that familiar with antiemetics for the nausea, but there are certainly some ones (any idea anyone?) out there that helps. Maybe antihistamienes like hydroxyzine. If you have a raised BP or heart rate during withdrawal, a beta blocker like propranolol is helpful.


To be really honest, the thing that has helped the WD's most is alcohol. And that's pretty much the worst thing to start taking regularly. If you have a high degree of self control, taking a few beers every now and then is no big issue though. If you struggle with insomnia, I can't say that you can't take a few beers if the insomnia is really bad. You might get a few hours sleep until the alcohol wears off but that may be better than no sleep at all.


Edit: Squeaky, I tried to PM you but you have chosen not to receive PM's. If you don't mind I'd be glad to send you a message.


Pregabalin withdrawal is hard but perfectly achievable. I've detoxed from benzos 3 times (and has to do a 4th it seems...) and that was in a totally different league, you can't die from Lyrica withdrawal, it's just nasty but it also gets better somewhat quickly in my opinion. There's no PAWS like for benzos that lasts months to years. When WD'ing from pregabalin, you start feeling better within days to weeks. Again, some suffer considerably longer, but at least it may give you some hope that for all it's not the case.

There might be some weight gain due to water retention, and also because pregabalin increases the appetite for most people (for me sugars, for some fatty foods).

You are so right about lyrica wd.I went months of lyrica binges and stopping abruptly.Most the time after a week of high dose binges I would feel shitty for a couple of days then back to normal.But it got me in the end I had a bad wd felt depressed no energy but b6 day 7 each day a massive improvement.I say by day 10 I was back to normal no anxiety but fatigue l8ngers a little longer.Opiate wd is worse but lyrica wd is a headfuck plus the anxiety is same as opiate wd.Lyrica a wonder drug for wd but we have add8ctive tendency and the euphoria lyrica causes can lead to what happened to me I swapped my opium addiction to a lyrica one.

A close friend of mine (no, I'm not doing that SWIM shit), started with 150mgs and within a year, he was being prescribed 1200 mgs/day. He gained A LOT of weight (water retention). I remember we went out to eat and drink one night, and I kid you not, he ate a fairly large Philly cheese steak, half a pan of pizza (large), and a platter for two at a BBQ spot. This was all in a matter of 2 hours. Then he quit cold turkey, and I only know the details, 'cause he'd call me pretty often to try and get his mind off the WD symptoms. But he was SUFFERING. He said it felt like a combination of extreme opiate and benzo WDs. I've taken a couple of his and loved it, but there just wasn't enough information available about this stuff at the time so I didn't get into it. In hindsight, I'm really glad I didn't. This stuff is too good when it works.


This stuff also works well for opiate/benzo WDs. But it doesn't work the other way around.

Hello everyone. I was given some generic pregabalin from a friend. It is a fat red and white capsule but has no writing on it. Inside are small clear crystals. They were not in blister packs. This is unlike my lyrica. Could anyone please help me confirm if these are safe to consume (I'm not using these to get high). Thanks!

The lyrica is amazing for opiate wd wish I knew about it for my detox.I found out on day ten when I still had bad anxiety and legs that felt like stone.It helped me sleep but then I smashed the hell out of them and the wd was brutal mostly anxiety and a deep deep depression that lasted 6 days till it got better.I had a few days now on it felt shitty but taking codeine which helps hopefully it's just the normal two days of feeling horrible and not the depression afterwards.

Got a question if anyone can help.


Been on this stuff for ages for anxiety. Obviously it stops working after a while due to tolerance. I tapered down off my dose but I stayed on 75mg per day because I didn't want to face further withdrawal (even a small one) due to other health issues. Now for various reasons I might up my dose. Asked the GP and they would only put it up to 200mg per day.


Would going up from 75mg to 200mg give me any anxiolytic effect? And any weight gain effect? I'm trying to achieve weight gain and also some help with anxiety. I felt that I'd needed a higher dose increase. I don't want to up the dose if it's not going to do much. I know the effect won't last forever but I have a tough couple of weeks coming up so it would be helpful to have a couple of weeks like when I first starting taking it and it was having a v good anxiolytic effect. Have been taking valium but I don't want to use it too often, which is why I'm considering this. For what it's worth I'm a 33 year old male, very tall (6ft 3) but massively underweight (55kg). I tend to have high natural tolerances for drugs but that may have gone down since I lost the weight. 


Many thanks in advance.

75mg never did anything for me. But 200 mg definitely had an effect.

If I were jumping from 75 to 200 I would feel it for sure. No weight gain, but feeling a little tipsy for a few days surely.

It's supposed to be every 12 hours but can be taken only once a day if that's all that required. Usually when instructions say *"as required" *it means "*as required*" up to the maximum frequency and dosage,  which for pregabalin is up to 300mg b.d. that is, no more than 300mg per individual dose and no more than this dose twice a day.. In this case *"as required"* doesn't mean just as many as you want, when you want. This is something that doctors sometimes overlook to tell their patients. When they say "*as required*", it is assumed that they have already gone through the MAXIMUM dosage and frequency of that medication with the patient beforehand.. and as I say in this case it's max 600mg/day and a dose every 12 hours maximum. This is clearly outlines in the patient information leaflet in the box (although in the case if pregabalin, the package insert leaflet is like a copy of War and Peace.


It's like with paracetamol, it may  say *"as required" *but it assumed you know that means *"as required"* up to a maximum of 1,000mg q.d.s (4 times a day i.e. max 1,000mg every 6 hours, maximum daily dose of 4,000mg.

I am prescribed Lyrica for nerve pain. It takes a day or so of using(or not using) it to see a change. So as needed would not work since there is no fast connection between taking a pill and getting relief from pain. I can take oxy as needed since it works in about 30 minures and goes away a couple if hours later.

I just take 600mg all in one go, chew the capsules up and wash down with a coffee. I've just got out of jail and PG is the drug of choice (and spice of course!) I've taken 900 this morning but I was high yesterday so not expecting a massive buzz. Tolerance is quick to accumulate with PG. Have fun!!!!

I just read a statement from the FDA in the US. They are mentioning Pregablin and Gabapentin together with the opioid crisis as drugs of abuse. 

Sounds like the prescription situation here is going to become a real pain in the ass in the next couple of years......

Although not a controlled drug in the UK ***yet***, my doctor reckons it's going to be scheduled soon... 5 or so years ago, doctors over here were dishing them out like candy but they've wised up now. Also. as the poster above alluded to, they have overtaken subutex as the number 1 prescription drug of abuse in British prisons according to a few articles I've read and from a school friend who has recently been released from prison.

I finally had a chance to try the generic pregabalin in Canada.  They were only 25 mgs pills.  I get gabapentin prescribed for sciatica.  The pregabalin seemed almost exactly the same, except 400 mgs of pregabalin seemed to work as good as 3200 mgs of staggered gabapentin.


Jeez, anything can get a person "high" if they took enough.  Too much money in this, maybe a little more restriction but these are not going away.

Depenting on you're brains what kind of effects you get, I know lot of people who don't get any kind of pleasent effecets from pregabalin no matter what dose. I personally get very powerful effects from it, its like opioid or ghb high. So I like it even better than oxycodone. Gabapentin never have gave me any kind of "high" no matter what dose, I tried 4g but nothing.


Pregabalin also makes me extremely horny.


Any other enjoys nicotine while on pregabalin? It seems it has some synergy.

Benzos for me not, actually they take enjoyable pregabalin effect away. Gabapentin has same effect. Amphetamine doesn't seem to make pregabalin more enjoyable but makes amphetamine more enjoyable, opioids make opioids more enjoyable. But I don't reccommend take stimulants or opioids, because they are very addicting.


Only one rather safe one is nicotine, but it only boosts it when pregabalin works normally, so if pregabalin dont have that good buzz, nicotine won't boost it.

Ahcohol has a very similar effect to Lyrica for me. Lyrica is preferable only because the hangover is less, but otherwise at the proper dose I wait 2 hours and I feel drunk. 

I havent tried to potentiate one with the other for fear of getting too drunk, but my guess is a few shots of tequila around 2 hours after a large dose of Lyrica would make me really stupid.

I can't recommended pregabalin, gabapinoid or phenibut (is there more gabapinoids), especially pregabalin will give you at least as bad WD's or even worse than ocycodone, not as bad as poppy pot tea. Also if it works great for you by recreationally, it is as addictive like oxycodone. MAny times I rather choose pregabalin than oxycodone.  If you much use for recreational use, never go over 3 day use. I wouldn't take any opioids or gabapinoids for even worst pain there is availbable, because nowadays I get WD's from single use, and I rather go throught extreme pain than from WD's you get from pregabalin. Terrible drug that was advertised as not addictive.

Not sure, some people say they don't get any WD's from pregabalin even after long periods of time, it's mystery, for me they were as bad as opium or poppypods/PPS WD's but pregabalin lasted just 1 week, opium/PPS/methadon (not sure never trierd, jsut read) WD's around 3-6months.


But I used pregabalin first time 2 months 1-3g days, second time 1-2g, last time 1,5g/day, so you have pretty low dosage compared to these. You should try and see maybe you are one of the lucky ones who don't get anything. FOr me WD's starts after 12h from last dosage, when going to sleep and taking dose, in the morning I'm sweeting like hell and the real strong WD's jsut begings. Yes keep pregabalin at hand, if you do get strong WD's I advice start to cut the dosage to slowest possible or go hardcore like me after 4 months 2g/day doses, doing amphetamine, XANAX, GBL/GHB and finally drunk alcohol 24/7 for 4 days. This way I dealt the WD's, they always were backround, but most likely were overpowered at least with GBL and amphetamine at the same time. But the depression after that lasted 2 months, it was extreme deopression, was thinking suiucide evey day. For this one you should use ketamine 100mg/day every 2 months, depenting how it effects, sometimes one ketamine dose cures depression for rest of youre lfie sometimes only for 2 weeks, many countries tehy offer this treatment, which is better option so you won't start abuse it, as usinng ketamine every day for weeks will cause depression. THe last opiton does not go well with harm reduction, but for me it was the best way, as never had a problem stopping using amphetamine, GBL or alcohol, for many people you just get new addiction.


If you get the lyricas from doctor then tell him you want to cut it slowly to zero, but if you hit the  point where even smallest cut still gives wd's then try GHB for 5 days, I found that 2 weeks of it makes you addicted to the way that you feel sick without it. Also  high doses of benzos might help, but dfont use them over 1-2weeks, over that you starting to to get depended to them.


Maybe kratom can also help, its hard to get in many places.


Problem in this forum is that everyone wants you to go could turkey, I tried 2 days and it was either suicide or taking amphetamine and GHB even if it was risk.

Nah, Im not talking anything to deal with WDs, If I get them ill just go back on and start reducing slowly.


I get them from the doc and have got loads spare cos I don't always take them.


I'm also on fentanyl patch 100mcg reducing 12.5mcg every month or so.. just want off everything but I've got a serious painful injury...a gunshot/shrapnel wound followed by falling off some step ladders back home (all to same leg).. as a result left leg is fucked.

I?m currently prescribed lyrica (after having a horrible detox from loads of meds and opiates cold turkey) I feel like the rehab making me go cold turkey fucked me up cause for months and months and even a year and a half later I don?t feel good.

However back to the lyrica. We didn?t want to go back to benzos or subutex or any of that stuff (well mainly my parents and doctor) but my leg pain hurt so bad I cried so much and was suicidal everyday. 

People were convinced my pain was from fibromyalgia. I?ve been given gabapentin in the past for anxiety, pain etc. So after many appointments and blood taken (so much shoot shit for you guys who hatneedsles or get queasy from blood, more than 40 times in the last few years and counting.

Well I took the lyrica50mg2xday. And it started improving my mood. Of course I didn?t take it everyday. But occasionally I?d take more and drink a Red Bull (reallly makes the high feel like coke/x/hydro (still mild thought.

Not a huge fan of lyrica but it was a good clutch in such a shitty time however.

I started taking kratom frequently and developed quite an addiction. Where is would only work for a few hours and the sickness of drinking it and taking by the pills wasn?t worth it.

So I got on suboxone. By the way I am prescribed marinol ?aka synthetic THC marijuana?![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) around the time of the leg pain, depression, bullshit. But yea the doctor finally put me back on subutex after I pretty much had to go to a methadone clinic to pay 12$ a day for 2 weeks in order to show him that I really needed it and that he is my doctor so now it definitely makes sense for him to prescribe it (since I get subutex atthe pharmacy for free) wellallmy scripts.

So now I have lyrica (50mg3xday), marinol (10mg3xday), Adderal 30mg XR 1/day, Adderal 20mg IR 1/day.

In the past 4 months my anxiety hasn?t gotten any better and has got downhill bad. I have had many panic attacks where my body shuts down, freezes upike someone stabbed a frozen spear in my spine and flows to every bone in my body, sweating, trembling, vomiting profusely (sometimes barely have eaten anything)

So my doctor added on .5mg klonopin 3x aday about 4-5 months ago.

I have been prescribed 1mg 2x a day before of klonopin. But remember I try to spread these out and actually almost never used them when prescribed before although more a bit now. However in the recent 2 weeks the day before thanksgiving I was having a seizure like episode, called my dad cause he was texting me and I couldn?t text. He showed up army house (prior I took a kpin and tried to dissolve it under my tongue) and grab some cereal to put on my stomach during this nightmare panic attack. I got upstairs and my dad got to my house came to my room and I immediately started vomiting again feeling like shit. He took me to the ER and they just gave me a1mg Ativan (wish I got iV dilaudid or Valium![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) and some zofran(nausea). But whatever. 

This made my case better so when I next sawmy doctor he was like I think you need3mg klonopin a day, and also some 2mg ones in emergency. I asked if I could try Ativan first so he did that. I wanted the 2mg 3x aday (cause he gives me those in the hospital during nc the day and I do fine onthem which I tell him).

But he just gave me 90 1mg and 14 2mg which I?m not complaining ???✌?![⛄](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/26c4.png)️???


But damn usually when I take benzos alone they don?t do much. So I usually snort 15-30mg of adderal and it seems to almost potentiate them.


OH AND IDEFINITELY AGREE WITH THELYRICA, benzo, (possible amphetamine) combination.

Last Tuesday when I got my Ativan script, I was on 400 mg of Lyrica all day, and 20 mg of adderal (formy doctor appointment, that shit took almost 2 hours. 1:45 of it waitingin the room cause he has to go to the hospital and deal with the mental psych ward patients first....been there) 

But I came home and started cleaning and finishing a monster (from the adderal and lyrica) then popped 2 damn Ativan and damn I was so high, quite drunk feeling, and it lasted for a damn while! Later I popped 1 more mg and it almost reincarnated the first high.


Damn I?m sped out and on a bit of etiz and 2mg of Ativan too. Happy pill popping and Lyrica vibing to you all![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)✌??????![✨](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/2728.png)??


Hopefully this will give some of youinformation on good combinations and a nice trip report![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)!

Long story, but...would pregabalin that is expired still work the same? The expiry dates are in 2018 and 2017.

It gets old in the same way sugar does. The fine powder inside the capsules gets cakey, but it really doesnt change much. It will be good for many years if not forever.

Hey man, welcome to Bluelight! We actually don't directly provide people with instructions regarding "how to get high". That's a matter of personal preference and only you will ultimately know what you want. The only way to find out is to try.


Hey Sublime! It's none of my business man, but how do you feel about being put on all of these drugs? I am by no means implying that I know better than your prescriber(s), but I would feel bad if I weren't sure that you knew what is waiting for you on the other side of these prescriptions. I'm not totally sure what your chronic history entails, but if you do continue using all of this stuff daily, quitting could be a very difficult process.


Are you aware of the difficulty involved in quitting chronic Benzodiazepine use? This is the big one, but frankly, I've found Pregabalin (Lyrica) withdrawal to be nearly as severe as withdrawal from Alcohol. Quitting CNS stimulants can be difficult too.

I am prescribed both 75mg capsules (1 every morning) and 150mg capsules (2 x per day), its effects are similar to XTC/GHB.  It is a unique drug, I find it creates a 'floatiness, relaxing' feeling at higher doses.  If you take a dose of 300mg with an opiate, it increases the opiate high by a good 50% at least for me it did.  It is a VERY expensive drug, <snip> I think that is why a lot of people who don't have insurance coverage can?t afford it.  I?m entirely convinced it has serious potential to be especially useful for withdrawing from opiates/benzos or as a comedown aid for stimulants.  It was prescribed to me for some serious nerve damage (neurotrophy).  I have taken it for so long my doctor decided to switch to Gabapentin. Love the Gabapentin and it works great, but now I have nearly 200 pills and I wasted a lot of cash in co-pays.

Yes thank GOD you said that bc I was starting to wonder what kind of person would ever recommend to a new Lyrica user a ultra high dose like that. Unbelievable I guess the devil is just everywhere and so ready to send someone to their demise.

Well, here's my view on all this, from someone who uses prescribed substances ONLY (with the exception of minor amounts of cocaine).


Because I'm reduced to using walk-in clinics in Canada (doctors not accepting new patients, my old doc lives 45km away, etc) I don't have access to my usual Dilaudid or even morphine whilst I'm there (I'm also UK-based).  So I'm taking Lyrica 300 bid as an alternative for pain (or rather, itching and burning).  Cannabis (which is fully legal here, legal as in cigarettes) is not an option except on the days I'm not working, and those are few and far-between.


Anyway, from a prescription perspective, this stuff is not like benzos AT ALL.  It isn't hypnotic, like Xanax or jellies (temazepam).  From what I've taken (and that's a very long list), the closest parallel I could draw would be to methaqualone (Mequin or Mandrax, now almost unavailable) or the non-hypnotic barbiturates (like Nembutal or Luminal).  Your co-ordination is G-O-N-E gone; if you're not familiar with Mequin or Nembutal, I'd say it feels like plain old alcohol without the "dirty" feeling.  It's a time-release "disco biscuit", essentially—takes 2 to 3 HOURS for it to kick in, in my case, but I'm high as a kite for 18-19 hours afterwards.  If I smoke a cigarette on this (and I'm a 40-80 a day smoker), I feel like I'm six feet up in the air.  Closer to Luminal than Nembutal in that respect... but...


This stuff is, as far as I know, Schedule V in the USA; I know for a fact that in the Great White North, it is a standard prescription drug on par with, say, penicillin or Largactil.  In fewer words, it's considered non-addictive.  HORSESHIT.  You do NOT want to be around me if I've gone (temporarily) cold-turkey.  Subjectively, I get EXTREMELY anxious and my heart feels like it'll explode (in spite of normal-to-high BP).  I have cold-turkeyed off Luminal before, which caused a bit of a chill on the first day (the shivers), but nothing afterward, and everyone knows how cold-turkeying off opiates feels (like crap, but you know you won't die in the middle of the night).  This is much worse.


Luminal is Sched III in the US (I think), Dilaudid is Sched II (I know), and yet this stuff is far more addictive, I find.  


So be careful, people.  Don't snort, don't IV, and for the love of God don't take 1200mg a day for multiple days because you WILL have withdrawals.

The big red and white capsules are Lyrica 300's.  The strongest available.  Take it from someone who knows.  Both generic and brand-name Lyrica look like that; brand name Lyrica has more of a blood-red colour, but still looks roughly the same.

I agree. Very similar to alcohol, but a lot less dirty blood and 3-4 hours to start working. And the withdrawals suck. Three  days of use and I have to taper off it or I will be nauseous and not sleep. And thats from 300-500 mg use per day.

Spurs:

My experience is that you may want to do a quick taper down to your previous dose. Maybe do 250 mg or so today and 150 mg tomorrow. Then back to 75 the following day. 

Get to zero asap. Stay off it for a week. Don?t tell your Dr.. Keep a stash and use it every two or three days if possible. Pregablin is most effective when not used at all. Yes your daily use at 75 mg has likely temporarily ruined some of its effects. If you suddenly jump to 600 mg one evening you will nod off, but the daily boost you got in the beginning 3 years ago may be gone unless you quit for a while.

Thanks. That's helpful. Do you think a high dose like 600mg would have a lasting effect? Or would it only work for about a week of everyday use? I think it would be better to do a quick taper, but I'm not really feeling well enough right now. Maybe I will try and do it anyway.

Anyone else tried snorting Gabepentin?


I had seen something about in on here ages ago & well before I had tried them & the last year my friend has been giving me his script of them as he doesn't like them so he unloads them onto me.  The last few days I have been trying out this ROA but it is not a nice experience, to me the taste is really NOT good & it is also a lot of powder to get up there.


How much do people do if they use this ROA?

Any tips / advice on it would be great.

I'm doing a quick taper...what do you think? I am going to take 150mg tonight, 125mg tomorrow morning, 100mg tomorrow night, 75mg the following morning etc until 25mg in the morning and 50mg at night again as I was doing two days ago. Do you think I'll get rebound anxiety? I'm in a bit of an anxiety and depression (and severe IBS) at the moment, and I can't risk further anxiety as I need to go to work and also look after my 96 year old Grandma in her care home.

Your taper sounds fine to me. 

The issue with Pregablin is that tolerance builds fast in recreational use. I can go from zero use to having fun for two days at 300mg, then needing 600 mg to get back to fun for two more days. In 4 days I have built a complete tolerance to the fun side effects of over-use at 600 mg per day(all in a single daily dose). And I will have to taper for 4 days to avoid nausea and insomnia to get back to zero.

If you try to quit all together for a while, you will likely have some anxiety for a few weeks.  Most people do, for upwards of 8 weeks after prolonged use.  A slow taper from your base dose over a month or two would help to avoid that- starting from 75 mg daily in your case. Maybe dropping 25 mg at a time for two weeks at a time

Get back to 75mg for a week. Either get off it completely for a week or two, or stay at 75. Try every other day(or better every third day) at 300-400 mg more and see how it hits you. Best if you can get to zero first.

You should decide your biggest goal first. Do you want to get away from this drug or are you more interested in playing with it?

That sounds awful. Theres a bbc3 documentary on YouTube about Pregablin in Ireland- Belfast Buds- They follow one guy who snorts 600 mg per day and it is the most disgusting crap. Gabapentin tastes the same, but you have to take 10x as much for the same effect.

I have never snorted either, but it cannot be worth it. Just biting the capsules makes me gag.

How much gabapentin would you be planning on snorting?

A slow taper from your base dose over a month or two would help to avoid that- starting from 75 mg daily in your case. Maybe dropping 25 mg at a time for two weeks at a time

Cheers mate.


I am using it for anxiety and IBS, it's not really recreational. Of course it can be difficult to know where mental health problems stop and using drugs to get a buzz begins (it's undeniable that it feels good to get rid of anxiety and pain) but recreational is not my conscious intention. I'm actually getting more out of it at the above mentioned dosages now, partly because I have upped my amitriptyline dose and partly because I think I was just so insanely anxious last week that I was noticing it less. So I'm going to stay with it for now, as anything which helps is more than welcome.


FWIW I tried using it every three days similar dosages to what you mentioned, a few years back, and it ended up giving me WD's after a couple of months despite not using daily or even every other day, so I'm not sure it's sustainable...for me at least (some people are less susceptible to WD).

I've just started trying Pregabalin, and it's a bit like being drunk, but different. Highest I've done so far is 450mg


but I think I've expereinced side effects. My libido seemed to vanish  - I suddenly noticed I hadn't had a hard-on for a while - has anyone else experienced that? I'm also a little concered that I may gain weight as that's supposed to be a common side effect

I do a similar amount once every week or two and it makes me horny asf haha. Can last for ages too. It's great! Love how it's such a distinct "high" feeling without being incapacitating and obvious to the outside world. A joint at the tail end of a session is bliss, as well!

^ me too - my libido seems to vanish when I take Pregabalin. don't think I've gained any weight though (I hope)


The maximum I've taken so far is 750mg. The effects last for a long time, so be careful if you need to do anything like driving the next day.


I think tolerance builds up pretty quickly, so daily use probably isn't a good idea

I take 600 mg a day,orally, and after about three days, I noticed that any high that I experienced was gone.  Guess I adapted pretty quickly.  I did not, however, miss the sleepwalking, which is truly creepy.  Had the same problem, BTW, with Chantix.

I despise Lyrica!  The worst sexual side effects I have ever experienced were from Duloxetine.  Or, as it’s commonly known as........Cymbalta.   Works well for neuropathic pain though.

Why do you despise Lyrica because you experienced sexual sides from duloxetine? Either you forgot to write something or you think they are related in some way. In any case your post as it is now doesn't make much sense.

Tolerance builds with Lyrica maybe faster than any other drug. Good news is that tapering off it can go just as fast.

Not him, but I take 75mg per day for medical purposes. When I feel like getting high I take ~1g (I have a script for 250 mg daily so saving pills isn't a problem, I don't take 250 mg daily because the difference in medical purposes between 75 mg and 250 mg is negligible). If I wanted to get high the next day I'd need at least 1.5g if not 2g for the same effect. After around a week 1g is enough to get high again. Even during this time the 75mg for medical purposes continues to work fine.


I've been of it for a few weeks if I ran out and forgot to refill my script and didn't feel any wd or whatever. Just the medical effects faded after a few days.


My script is for anxiety for which it works but not super well, however it also makes my back totally pain free which is the main reason I take it.

Not quite following you, but Lyrica has definitely had a negative impact on my libido and ability to perform. I think its partially the analgesic effect leading to reduced sensation as well as mental 'dullness' that makes getting to that heightened orgasmic state really difficult. 


That said, high enough doses make me horny as fuck and in the mood to do all sorts of fucked up shit, but the lower daily dose I take (300mg) only really has a negative impact. I would consider it close to opiates in terms of its anti effect of libido, but SSRI's have been the shit that has totally blocked me from orgasm.

Based on its half life if you want to use it every day just leave a full 24 hours, plus 7 hhours. So if on Monday you took it at 6am, on Tuesday you take it at 13:00 (6 am plus 7 hours). 

I don't recommend daily dose, but if thhe purpose is to get high for a little binge just wait one full 24 hour cycle, plus 7 hours. 

Try it and see.

I cut by 50% per day about every 3-5 days. Then by 25% when I get down to 100 mg daily. Begin by stabilizing at two doses per day.

Ex: Starting from 600mg daily. 

Day 1= 600 mg(300 mg at morning, 300 mg at evening)

Day 2-6=300mg(150 mg morning, 150 mg evening)

Day 7-11=150mg(75mg morning, 75 mg evening)

Day 12-16=100mg(50mg am, 50mg pm)

Day 17?21=75mg at evening only

Day 22-26=50mg at evening only

Day 27-31=25mg at evening only

Then zero


The evening dose is about 2 hours before bedtime because thats when the drowsiness from Lyrica hits me. If youre in a hurry, I would cut those days down to 3 days per step. The slow-down at 100mg is important to avoid wds.

NOTE- I have to open my capsules and separate the powder into equal piles with a razor blade to get the specific doses. Ex: 150 mg capsule: 1/2= 75 mg, 1/3= 50mg, 1/6= 25 mg. Its not as hard as it sounds but you have to lick up your doses from the plate and Lyrica tastes AWFUL.

I've used generic and they definitely had an effect but they were genuine medications (ie. from a legitimate pharmaceutical source). If you acquire it from a dubious source then who knows. The generic is much cheaper

If you want to completely avoid withdrawals, yeah. That is what works for me. You can do it in two weeks by cutting the time frames in half, but you will be feeling a bit crappy most of the time.

As for the capsules: I twist them open and save the empty capsules. When Im taking partial caps and  I have to be away from home, I refill the empties so Im not  doing it in the bathroom at work.

Yes, it's a CNS depressant, but I *think* taken on it's own respiratory depression shouldn't be a problem. In combination with other drugs it might be a problem:

There arent any stories floating around about overdosing on Lyrica or gabapentin. Theres always a way to overdose(you can die from drinking too much water), and theres always a chance of you having an unusual reaction. SO- you need to be careful.

Man, tolerance really builds with Pregabalin. I took 1500mg last night and felt almost nothing. Time for a few days break


Don't quote me on this but I think having an empty stomach helps, or at least makes the onset more rapid. I also snip off the ends of the capsules before swallowing in case they don't all dissolve in the stomach

I took Lyrica in the past 2 days. 2 days ago i had great feeling of being relaxed and happy. Yesterday I took the same ammount and I barely felt anything so I took more and I had different feeling. How many days of break I need to have in order to have the same feeling after taking same ammount of Lyrica as for the first time 2 days ago?

Empty stomach is always best for fast absorption. I like to open the capsules, pour the powder in my mouth, and then swallow the powder and capsules together. The powder tastes like a dogs butthole, but onset is definitely faster and more acute.

It depends on the dose but I would wait at least 1 week. It only works days in a row if you massively escalate the dose. Not advised at all. It is what leads to dependance and the very difficult withdrawal.

Swallowing capsules whole means slower absorption, thus you feel it while there is still some to be digested. Opening capsules equals instant absorption and the effects are 100% immediately, with nothing left to get into your blood later. Imagine the difference between doing a shot of tequila on an empty stomach vs drinking a whole margarita with dinner.

ah I see. I remember back when I used to use kratom - most people used gelatin capsules - there was a theory going around that not all the capsules might dissolve and some would be excreted through your system intact, hence why we used to snip off the ends. Don't know whether there's any truth to that or if it was just paranoia

The gel capsules (probably all capsules) dissolve pretty quickly even in water. The possibility that they could pass intact is basically zero. It is however quite possible for one to dissolve and expose its contents an hour or so after the others you ingested have been difested. SO snipping the ends is not as crazy as it sounds.

Thanks a lot for information, I'm taking 75 mg 2 times a day. If I'll take 300 or 450 mg once a week or two while taking 2 of them everyday I'll have the same effect as for the first time or similar?

Dunno, but it's rarely gonna be like the first time/s. I am prescribed 150mg x 2 a day and maybe once week I'll take 450mg at once and get a mild wobbly high that goes nicely with some good weed. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) This doesn't change the limited benefit I get from Pregabalin daily dosing. If you were to regularly take 450mg, which is triple your regular dose, you will definitely experience tolerance build up and rapidly. 


I pushed doses to silly levels and ended up in very acute withdrawal and it was a fucking nightmare so I have little inclination to abuse this drug, I just seriously warn anyone who thinks you can abuse this stuff to no ill effect. I've had trouble getting my dose below 300mg a day but as a reduction from 1200mg a day 6 months ago it's not too bothersome just staying like this. Though every few weeks I try to reduce by 75mg or so and struggle terribly with non-stop anxiety, so I just increase and feel fine pretty quickly. All in all, a drug not worth the side effects ime.

To sum it up, pregabalin is great for what it is perscribed for. That being said, the "high" one acheives is not worth it. It throws off the rest of your dosing schedule. It becomes more work then fun. The only thing people have going for them is the fact that although withdrawals suck, they pale compared to a real withdrawal such as one from benzodiazepines.


If a person simply trains themselves to use the correct perscribed dosage, it will go a long way and produce very good effects. Cheap buzzes are not worth it with this class of drug.

Lyrica wds are no joke. Its prescribed for nerve pain, insomnia, anxiety and depression, and a bunch of other stuff. Wds mean ALL of those problems come straight to you, and they last sometimes for months. 

Its fun to play with for one day at a time, but daily use for even one week lead to acute wds. Not something to disrespect. 

I have withdrawn from opiates, benzos, and Lyrica. This one is not life-threatening like benzodiazepines but it can make you wish you were dead.

I feel Pregabalin makes you calm and feeling bit drunk (300mg today, 1st time btw) and Phenibut only makes calm, not much of a 'high' there.

I dunno man, having been through withdrawal from both, I find Lyrica way worse. Not as dangerous but incredibly unpleasant and scary as fuck. I would take benzo withdrawal over it. 


Of course, high doses cause worse withdrawal so if you keep dosing reasonable, and taper very gradually, it is not too bad but still utterly horrible.

I will give you a solid subjective on that one. You make some points. I'm just saying, abuse high dose Xanax for a month, and taper off in a few weeks. If I had to pick, it would be neither, but for only argument sake pregabalin is IMO lighter weight by comparison.


Either one can cause heavy dependance, very bad withdrawal, serious side effects, mental fuckery of all sorts. They both can scare you, leave you hurting mentally, psychologically, physically and in some not so rare cases kill you. Death is not fun. Abuse of either substance is highly discouraged.

I have never heard of purely pregabalin withdrawal by itself directly killing someone, althought it doesn't mean it is not impossible simply because someone has not done yet. Just to contradict myself, if iit were severe enough to throw someone into major epilepic fits, that could lead to it. That is a stretch but technically....


As far as overdose goes, CNS depression is the key there. No futher explanation needed. Many posts on this site cover how that works. And yes, enough pregabalin could lead to significant CNS depression.

I know you won't be able to give anything like a precise figure on overdosing, but do you think I'm skirting close to the wind with 1200mg?


I guess Preg's rapid tolerance is like a safety catch forcing you to take a break for a while which can't be a bad thing

The fact you are a Bluelighter makes me wonder if you know better then to ask this publicly, yet at all. Pardon the attitude, but any amount can fuck you up. The warnings with almost any drug start with " we don't know the exact mechanism of how this drug works " 


So to get to the point for you quickly, yeah, 1200 mg of a drug that is prescribed in much lower amounts can cause all of what I posted a few posts ago. 


You cannot rely on tolerance as a cushion for overdose. You can be the 1% where tolerance means absolutely nothing. Probably much higher then 1% but will leave it there.

Yeah..... Nobody really knows what a lethal dose of anything would be until a few people die from taking too much. I wouldnt want to be one of them who makes it into that kind of medical literature.

Plugging pregabalin will be extremely bad for you. It contains fillers very similar to talcom powder. You will get blood clots that can kill. I've seen it hapoen. Swim would encourage you to snort them if you are not happy by simply popping them, which on an empty stomach is as good as any other way

No, you are not. You would have to take 10s of thousands of mg to die from ptegab O. D.

Hi, im newbie here. 39y/o male with no drugs abuse history. 


Read some successful stories regarding withdrawing benzos with pregabalin  (Valium +Kpin) so why not give it a try? Well soon i found that this was a huge mistake.


Been on it only 3 weeks (20days now), started from 75x2 and 2 more weeks with 150x2. Somehow i ve not been feeling right on it so i thought it was right to say bye pregabalin (made mu dumb and zombie). But 0.75mg Kpin reduced. So Monday i decided to take only 75mg for 4-5 days and quit. Oh yeah, morning 75mg (then benzo) only lasted like till afternoon when anxiety + hear racing feeling with hot flashes hit me. So 75mg and gone. Sleep is gone too. So Tuesday same scenario 75mg in the morning and need to up 75 late afternoon. Now is Wednesday, i ve not taken any yet (2 days i was taking them like at 6 am) cos have a day off, no food, no sleep, feel crap, headache. But must be functional. I have no many (30)  75mg  pills left so how long would it take to feel ok on 75mgx2? Or just try tough it out and take when WD's hit really bad? 


I can order some more but it takes time. But - whats the point doing weeks tapper if i been only it 20 days? 


Im in deep ....

300 mg made me manic, so I tried opening the cap and taking about 1/8th. Same manic feeling again.  I am bi polar though so maybe it doesn't sit well with that

if the WDs are that bad then you really should get medical help to help you taper. It's the only safe way. Good luck

Your wds will last anywhere from a day to a month. Everyone is different.

My advice is to order more so you dont run out. You already seem scared of the stuff so you arent likely to abuse it if you have extra. 

Get on a 12 hour dose schedule. Once in the morning and once at night, but strictly at 12 hours.

Cut your dose by 50% once a week, but be prepared to take a bit extra for a day or two while you adjust to the new lower dose.

If if was me??-Starting at 150 mg x 2 per day, immediately switch to 150 mg in the morning and 150 mg in the evening for two or three days. Then 75 x 2 (am and pm)for a week. Then open the capsules to separate the powder into piles with a razor blade. Save the unused capsules to fill back up with powder for partial doses when not at home. Drop to 37 mg (1/2 capsule) x 2 per day for a week. Then 19 mg(1/4 capsule) x 2 per day for a week. If not ready yet, drop to 9 mg (1/8 capsule) x 2 per day for a week. Then 9 mg once per day for a week. Then zero.

It sounds crazy to be so militant and deliberate, but these drugs are meant to rewire your brain and your goal is to unfuck yourself while suffering as little as possible. If youre not up for this plan, then cold turkey will work but you will possibly suffer for a while and there is really no way to predict how long with pregablin-particularly while also wding from other drugs.

I forgot- the prescribed dosage reduction for Pregablin is drop 50mg daily every two weeks. My experience is with Pregablin you can drop 50% every week. The 50 mg route works good at 300mg but not so much at 75mg. 50% works well at all levels except that you have to open capsules and eat the dogshit powder inside.

Hi, thank you for your advices.


Yesterday i went back to my initial benzos dose (10mg valium and 1mg Kpin). I took 1mg Kpin in the evening when had mild wd's symptoms already (flashes, heart pounding) and when it was time for pregabalin. Nearly all symptoms went away (had 75mg preg at 11am). Im up since 7am today (mirtazapine helped with 7 hrs sleep), so far today i missed the morning dose of pregabalin and took 10mg valium at midday. Its not been too bad so far, spaced out a bit and nervous/anxiety and shaking. This lead me to think that i cut too much benzos whilst reduced pregs too rapidly. Waiting for symptoms to manifest and re-dose 1mg Kpin and try do not take pregabalin. 


From one side - benzos wouldn't ease pregabalin WD's if i ve been taking them before and with pregab in my normal dose, am i right? So may be im not into deeper side with it yet? 


So far its 26hrs since last 75mg dose. If im not wrong tolerance decreases too if not taken for too long in high doses. So i ll try test it with 1mg Kpin later when it gets too the bad point so maybe i will make a 48hrs run without any and 3 days with last 2x75mg. Is it the time where proper WD's would hit me? 


Hope i can do it without upping benzos and not taking more pregabalin (im not going do it but im hoping if i have to get back on pregabalin 1x75mg will be enough to stop feel this crap). And then try skip a day, then two...


What do you think?

Right. Kpin did not much, im not going raise it so 32 hrs after last 75mg i re-dosed another 75mg. Feeling better but not best (could potentiated kpin too). Mirtazapine for sleep and hopefully i can do another 24+hrs without re-dosing. Im having a busy day tomorrow hopefully i don't have to find short way... my lady & kids already noticed my behaviour changed, low mood etc  she doesnt know anything about my self-medication (had benzo initially pre-screbied for anxiety and taken ,,when needed" but it was miracle and never been above 1mg kpin and 10 valium, e.g. many weeks only on 10 valium). 


Trying get off benzos created another problem. Oh dear, 39 y/o never took any drugs, sport, football, gym, active, never abused alco and last summer something went wrong with me - anxiety, depression insomnia or whatever. Quick private consultant, prescription for 20x 0.5 Kpin to be taken only when needed. Miracle. All problems gone. 1mg a day, sometimes just half. Tappered down to 5 mg valium once. It was hard with every cut so i thought - so many people did it without suffering this much.


Only to try of how i will react to the stuff, never thought it has so addictive potential, i quit benzos after a month for 2 weeks without any wd's but this evil hit me hard i think. 


Sorry for a long story, feel like im fighting with life stressors on my own, added now some addictions i never had, no-one to speak to who would understand without labelling you ,,,smackehead". 


I hope i can run few more days with 24hrs or more breaks on 75mg. I really do. Got go work Sunday night, not easy job need to be switched-on (no driving job). Read some positive stories that body may adjust within a week to a new dose even with a huge cut (14 days 300- 2 days 150- 2 days75) after a few days.


Just dont want it any longer and will stop even my worse enemy from trying it.


Thx for patience, need stay strong and keep rest of my family happy but its so frikkin hard

Benzos didn't help for me at all, made it even worse, opioids didnt help, at least buprenorphine, feel same shit eitherway no matter how much you take them. But alcohol and GHB were only once that helped, GHB was best one. I've learned from years of abusing pregabalin the shit out of it (up to 3g grams), worst case was 4 months daily 1,5g pregabalin dose, almsot as bad to quit as quitting opium or opp ops (seeds or pods), I've learned that now I can take max only 3 days pregabalin without getting WD's, but it seems it has lost it magic now, so I dont get that nice mixed feeling of GHB and opioids like first, so not goign to take them anymore. Don't fuck with this med, maybe worst WD there is.

What a feeling this morning. 6hrs sleep on mirtazapine and ,,i dont want live any longer" feeling. Not good when you got stay busy all day. 


Had no choice, come out from bed and dosed 75mg. Guess what, no improvement. So after 2hrs another 75mg. Feel better but no motivation to go throughout the day. Never felt so low and destructed. So will try stay on this 150 and have couple beers later maybe. 20 days, if i told this my gp he would be laughing saying im joking. Need get more to tapper, cant afford spending 14 days bedridden.

So far im getting more pregab, 150mg and 300mg capsules but can break them and dissolve in water.


Any idea how to do it? If i break one 300mg capsule, use razor to split in half/quarters can i just simply dissolve it in warm water and drink?


If i go see gp he will put me on tapper plan or say - just tough it out. I ve got exams coming in May but somehow pregab was affecting my memory, even in a short-term time im taking it. Maybe i was cutting benzos to rapidly.  Dont want to relapse to full dose 150-0-150, i managed going through 5 days rapid cutting so my plan is:


1 - week or bit more 150-0-75

2 - week or bit more on 75-0-75

3- week or bit more on 75-0-0

4 - week 35 the breaks between days.


I hope this works well, any thoughts? Frickin hell 20 days on 4 week tapper what a devil...

Just had 1 beer, what a magic relief (being on 150mg pregab which i barely feel). I ll drink one beer every 2hrs and take 14 days off work, then i will use benzo to keep alco withdrawals in bay. 


(Joking but this one beer is better than anything. Only 3.8% but what a huge difference)

I dont understand this - i went originally to 150-0-75 and i dont feel much better. I feel when i dose it for 3 hrs but then sides or wd symptoms hitting me back again. This is 4th week im on it and im scared to f*ck. I must remain functional, earn money, be sharp. I read some dreadful stories and i think i ll might be 1 of them pretty soon --losing everything becsuse unability to work and function every day. Im an idiot and very dumb idiot - but i wasnt expecting that being only 3 weeks in low/moderate doses recommended by so many psychiatrists. Within 4 weeks i ruined my life...

Hi there, now we ve got Thursday. Managed going through past few days at work on 150-0-75. Felt slight improvement today (finally had some food etc.) so not looking backwards - another 75mg dropped. Tricky cos been on nights and switching to days and will be difficult to keep regular am/pm doses. Cant wait been on lower doses, feel like brain fog clearing up already but unfortunately no motivation/depression and anxiety. Well, i ll beat this f*ng poison. Kids feel im not myself trying avoid me and thats not fully blown wd's. 


Trying stay strong.

Well, managed dropping down to 1x75, rough af but still managed to do 12hrs shift. Did not really feel great on 2x75mg but somehow 2 days on 1x75mg is bearable so far. Anxiety and depression is there continuously, do you think its worth staying on this dose until i feel better (if i can feel any better?)and slow down with tappering this poison? 75mg supposed to be pretty low dose. I need to start preparation for some tests in may. As 1-2 small bottles of beer 3.8% helped with previous tapper im not taking this route anymore, i dont think its great idea. 


Its 15th day of tapper so far from 300mg/d down to 75mg. Will it get better on this dose in few days time? Splitting 75mg further (50mg/25mg/12.5mg) will result in less WD's at the end?

I appreciate any input.

I feel Im not able do it longer, thats it. I am honestly giving up. Over 3 weeks of feeling 'i want to die today' is too much. I ve got more pregs so im happily going back on it. Too much mental damage done already.

Pregab is a really pleasurable drug - it has empathic effects with very mild disso effects but is good for music and munchies too but after a few of years use I am tiring of it. How long does it take to get tolerance down? I upped dose for a while and once it started stuck to once a month (date night sort of thing) but now even 2 or more months I don't get anything like what I once got or is it like MDMA where it just changes at some point and is just a shadow of it's former self?

I heard that switching from lyrica to baclofen worked for some people and it was walk in the park tapering that. I wish i never touched the stuff but when doctor say...


I might use phenibut, baclofen, benzo - only to kick thjs stuff.

How long does it take to get tolerance down? I upped dose for a while and once it started stuck to once a month (date night sort of thing) but now even 2 or more months I don't get anything like what I once got or is it like MDMA where it just changes at some point and is just a shadow of it's former self?

I find tolerance increases rapidly with Pregabalin. I might do 1200mg one night, but the next I'd have to do at least 1500mg to feel anything. And I've gone higher than that with redosing, but often still felt nothing, so I guess the only way is to abstain for a few days at least before doing it again


when Preg works it's quite cool though. A bit like being drunk but without the hangover or bloated feelings

I personally find tolerance to take a bit to go down. Some effects may never come back, but overall, if you go through a 30 day script with high dose 1,000mg+ doses mixed in, I need minimum 3-4 weeks.

You are not coming off pregabs using baclofen? Well, i heard in some cases it works in some not. Baclofen has low binding affinity to Ca+ subunit but works mostly on gabab, phenibut is more potent on calcium subunit but pregab is most potent - its action in low and moderate doses is binding to VDCC and slow signalling. But it also slowly kills brain. I need get off it asap but ct can cause more damage.

Is lyrica safe to combine with soma (carisoprodol)? I enjoy either of these with weed, and got curious if doing all three is feasible or risky. Let's assume the dosages are kept reasonable (e.g. 300mg of soma and lyrica each + weed according to feel).

Hello guys,


I read someone on this thread and/or elsewhere was asking if some people ever felt some tingling in the fingers while on pregabalin and/or really bad coordination.   I have to say yes to both.. It was noticeable enough that I felt I had to join and write about it.


The tingling at one point was so there I had to wonder if it would ever wear off ( it wasn't painful or unbearable nether was it pleasurable). The coordination.. motor skills were ok (I was able to do anything walking,etc)  but when I started trying to write with a pen.. I had to stop trying.  I was able to write with  effort but it was not my calligraphy and wasn't at all inline.


I overdid a lot , can't say how many mgs of Pregabalin,  mixed with lots of gabapentin. Might have done 400 mg of Adderall XR. Was on Wellbutrin 300 mg XR too.


I also have a question :

Does anyone ever felt tingling/noise in the ears after using pregabalin ? it might also just be that I have the flu but it might be the stuff.  I am going cold turkey from 45 days 50mg x3/day of pregabalin abused in 4 days.Hope it will not suck too much.


No point of being stupid so I take full responsability.

Yep, tinnitus is normal. Brain fog, trouble concentrate - makes you dumb.  Good luck with CT, may take months to recover or you might be fine after a week. Please report back hos it goes.

damn, the rapid tolerance for Pregabalin is a bitch. You can take very high doses and feel absolutely nothing


I wonder how long it takes to reset tolerance to zero?

I have to admit cold turkey wasn't cool.. but nothing like the sickness of benzos. I am saving some this time..  Someone posted his method of coming down..  with the dosages. Any suggestions?  I think it's been 3,4 weeks without pregabalin, kinda did the trick but yeah rapid tolerance sucks, I am worried. Also some people are saying they lost the magic forever. That sucks.

If you take gabapentinoids once or twice a week maximum, you don't really build much tolerance.  But it has to be spaced out.  Like once every 4 days, I find doesn't build up a tolerance for gabapentin or for phenibut (I have only done lyrica a few times total but no reason to think it would work differently).

Last year I was fiending for valium so just asked this couple who came out of the needle exchange clinic if they knew where I could get some. Unfortunately they didn't but they gave me a 300mg Lyrica (I had taken a 150mg Lyrica twice a few years previously and remember just feeling pretty drunk) so I'm only about 100lb and had no tolerance.

I ended up going back to their apartment for (uh...stuff ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)) and I did about .2 of IV coke with them and had probably 7 or so shots of gin.

About 2-3 hours after the lyrica I suddenly experienced a severe loss of motor control, I was staggering and falling and couldn't even just sit without falling onto my back or sides on the floor. Was this caused by a bit of an overdose of the pregabalin? I'm pretty sure it was but I have never heard of this reaction from anybody else.

^300mgs wouldn't be an overdose, but Lyrica has bizarre and unpredictable effects. Extreme vertigo is not unusual. Also, you had 7 shots of gin- that combination may have contributed ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


I cycle through side effects like that everyday- this shit is just nasty, but the withdrawal is much worse than the actual effects.

I got down to 112mg split in two doses. Titrating down 2-3mg per day. Within 2 weeks i reduced 38mg with nearly no sides (depressed but no anxiety). When i dropped from 150 to 75 (lowest mg capsule i could get) i was f****g bad for over a week and got back up. I hope within another 6 weeks i ll be able say bye to this shit. 


I hope baclofen used sparingly helps when it gets below 50mg/day

If phenibut can be replaced with lyrica and vice versa and baclofen is useful tool to wean phenibut off so its worth give it a go. Baclo in right dose is great antidepressant and mood lifter and its much easier to come off than lyrica.

Anyone have expierence with 4-methyl-pregabalin? This looks like it could have some nice effects for me as I've dosed a whole box of regular pregabalin and noticed nothing. The first time I used pregabalin, it was pure powder and I don't remember how much I used but back then the effects were sweet.

900mgs of Lyrica today and only a mild high.. not even a "high".. just racing... heart racing, muscles jolting, grinding my teeth and rushing around...

On a positive note, it definitely gave me the motivation to clean all day long!

Sigh. The magic has gone! Took a fucking SHITLOAD the other day to combat work with a hangover... from memory it was 1100gm.... absolutely zero buzz. 

The following day I woke up completely straight and sombre. I decided to get my shit together (I had vomited all night and felt nauseous for 2 days) and only took 300mgs... which is my prescribed dosage. 

Weeelllll today I was irritable and snappy and found myself throwing back 750mg. No effect. 

Dumb.

Tonight I'm getting drunk, just to feel something. Ugh. Tomorrow I'll be reaching for the Lyrica again. Wish I had Endone and Ritalin as well.. that's the greatest pill combo I've ever had.. the roller coaster over 12 hours is insanely awesome.

How would you guys describe the difference between Gabapentin and Pregabalin?

I know Pregab is stronger so you need a lower dose, but how do they FEEL compared to each other? Do they have the same effect?

Just put some good relaxing music playing and lay down on bed, if one day done help try two days, at least what they do in clinics for depression.

 I'm not sure about the interactions, but I've read that taking one big dose of ketamine like 70-100mg two days a row is the effective way to cure depression, at least in hospital studies, I did that afte went to could turkey, but because I had to use 300mg quetiapine for insomnia too the ketamine effect was blunted a lot, but still it helped. But microdosing can help to ease wd's at least opioid wd's. I've never tapered pregabalin as I read wd's can't kill you, but I don't know how long have you been on pregabalin, is this tappering plan made by doctor? I still meet doctors that believe lyricas don't cause addiction and are safe to use without much problems, I think they believe anythign that big pharmas tell them.

No, its my own taper plan. Cant afford CT so weaning off. Apart from depression its not that bad but fun starts with further reduction. 


Well, dont have an access to it anyway and dont want risk trouble with dark net orders. May order a bit kratom but dont want swapping dependencies so for days off couple beers is like gods gift for a few hrs. 


Cheers for your reply.

I have said on here before: taking just a LITTLE too much baclofen will send you into a very suddenly and EXTREMELY deep sleep. Borderline-Coma.

This may be counter intuitive but I find very low dose amphetamine I.e 10-20mg to help combat the extreme gloom and depression of pregabalin withdrawal. It helps with motivation but may increase anxiety and shakiness. To each their own, but it's the only substance that lifts the depression of withdrawal.


Pregabalin is a nasty fucking drug imo. It's effective for pain but the side effects and withdrawal are hellish.

Are the withdrawal side effects only in long term, high dose users?

I've been on it for around 3 months, daily... sometimes I stick to my prescribed dose (150mg X 2 a day) but mostly I find myself going upwards of 600.. 900.. 1500... 

I'm taking them for anxiety and they are actually working..

I've heard that taking more than 600mgs is actually pointless, as your liver cannot process that high an amount so it just sits there, damaging the liver ?

It may builds up in liver but mainly kidneys processing this shit. Many users reporting kidneys infections. WD's may be light or non existent for some users and pretty bad and rough for others. CT from high doses may lead to long, months lasting PAWS. If you taking it for anxiety you can expect strong anxiety rebound, this drug shouldnt be prescribed for it, it looses it effectiveness with tolerance. 3 months on such high doses most likely give you some hellish time, with suicidal thoughts. Be careful, this poison is not fun.

Does gabapentin also cause kidney issues?  I ask because I've been using gabapentin lately and had a kidney stone recently.


Lyrica is great if you do it from time to time.  It doesn't seem like a good choice to be on daily though.


Anything physically addictive will have given you physical dependence/withdrawals before 3 months especially if you're taking more than prescribed, but even at the prescribed dose.

Well, fuck. 

Thanks for the advice. This has been the only drug that has actually really helped me.. but in saying that, it has definitely numbed pretty much most of my emotions.. lately I've noticed that I don't feel sexually aroused anymore ? Absolutely cannot orgasm on them, either. 

I honestly don't know what to do.. if I stop taking them I'll be back to where I was.. and that was a very dark place. But remaining on them is fucked in many aspects, too.. 

Damned if you do, damned if you don't...

Taper and below 50mg not only orgasms but also memory is better. It takes time and patience but well worth. I tapered to quick in first place, dropping 75mg at a time from 300 mg gave me wd's and awful depression. Changed tactics and taper 2-3 mg per day (water titration). Tinnitus nearly gone, sex back again, more emotional. Depression hitting me often but in waves now and some hours are like 7/10 and some 3/10. Trying keep myself active and distracted, working like 60hrs a week and not trying think about wd's.


Going start keto diet after weekend, first benefits i may feel after 2-3 weeks, about right when it comes closer to 0. Ordered picamilon, i hope it helps with mood swings. Failed with ketamine, dark nets too risky in the uk. Magnesium citrate. Potassium. Iron. Omega, wallnuts and other healthy oils. I hope my D receptors are not permanently affected as well as my pre-lyrica great memory. I regret trying it every fkin day, hate carefuly preparing and measuring right amount of this shit. Never again.

I hear you regarding the memory.. it's sooooo bad. I can't even recall the names of the people I work with at times.. and just finding the right words to use in a sentence.. it's like drawing a complete blank. 

I have no idea how to taper correctly because I've abused this drug in high doses which have been erratic. However, today I'm sticking with 450mgs.. 300 in the morning, 150 at night. Can only try and see how I go. My plan is to do this for a week.. If all goes to plan, next week I'll try 150 x twice a day.. 

I woke up with trembling hands this morning, couldn't even type ?

Once you find your baseline without wd's im strongly recommending smaller but continuous drops. E.g. if you ll be ok with 300mg a day (split in 2x150mg doses) start taking 5mg less a day instead of doing big drops. Dissolve 150mg in 75ml of warm water and using syringe take 2.5mg less from each dose (say 1.5ml less) every day. It takes 2-3 months but you dont have to suffer that much and you can hold it for a while.when needed.


You seem to be sensitive like myself so be careful with it, ct is not fun.

Don't bother. The "high" is weird  at best. Not to mention a delicate balance.. and stupidly addictive.

Too much, IMO, is not enjoyable or pleasant whatsoever; not enough is a waste of time. Get the right dose and you'll be chasing that.. but then you won't find it unless you abstain for days on end...

I'm not up for this shit...

So I only took 450mgs yesterday and I had the worst sleep, I kept waking in pools of sweat, my entire body was just dripping.. the anxiety this morning was a cunt, to say the least. 

I know I need to try again ? But have taken another huge dose today just to feel normal.. 

This is some fucked up shit...


Edit: I also broke 2 ribs during the week and am in fucking agony ?

Don't think this is the right time to withdraw.. but then, when will be?

Feel for you. I honestly do because there's nothing really that helps. Only time and patience. I was ready swap pregab and try phenibut instead but i wasn't really up for it when some1 said on reddit that 150mg pregab will be around 2.5g phenibut. Now at around 55mg i know it would be a stupid idea. Dont recommend alcohol during taper - it will make you depressed af next day for next few days. It may help with wd's during ct and Neo reported that he was drinking insane amount of booze - but there is no guarantee you ll be ok after a week or 2 drinking 24 beers a day. 


Took me a month taper 100mg and remain functional but my doses were only 300mg max for a week. I am carrying on with taper and won't drink more than 1 or 2 beers on my days off.

Quickfixgrrl- listen to Voiceoffesr. I have tapered off Lyrica several times. You seem to be having the same problems he has had. The dissolve into warm water trick is excellent advice.  Don’t get discouraged at the length of time . Get stable at a consistent daily dose and break it up into two or three doses per day.

You may do better going back and tapering slowly off Lyrica. It is a shitty drug, but the wds from Valium can be much worse. If you go the Valium route, you need to be conscious of the need to taper from that if you use it more than a week or so. Lyrica wds can last months, so using Valium may be setting you up for withdrawls from two shitty drugs. And Valium wds often equal seizures that can be fatal.

And benzo helps slightly with wd's. Just short term with anxiety and maybe with sleep but it won't help with other symptoms. Im finding coming off benzo (slow taper) easier than lyrica. Why? I think its not so depressive with suicidal thoughts, its not shooting dopamine receptors off, its not affecting gut's health badly. Just dont use benzos or use absolutely when you must but twice a week max. And try find your baseline, best start taper asap, theres no other route.


Benzos main mechanism of action is through gaba A and pregabalin is through VDCC. There is no cross tolerance but when pregabalin/lyrica can attenuate benzo wd's im afraid it doesnt work opposite way. There will be too much glutamate and other neurotransmitters storm that benzo  wont stop.

I've been off benzos since I started the Lyrica... and I was chewing through a fuckload monthly for almost 3 years straight. I would take them erratically, get my presription for 50 pills a month and take them within a week. I'd then be forced to go without for another week or so, usually get my hands on another 20 pills to see me through the remaining weeks until I was due for my next script..

I didn't experience any withdrawals.. Or, maybe I did, but couldn't tell, because of my ever prevalent anxiety/ depression. I was on a constant merry -go-round, getting nowhere. 

During this time I was placed on other meds for my anxiety, Mirtazapine/Seroquel/Quetiapine and such... I quit them all pretty fast, because I hated the side effects, namely weight gain. Stupid, I know, but I would have been even more depressed had I gained weight... 

That's when I came across Lyrica. I initially tried it solely to get buzzed, in combination with Oxy and Ritalin.. I'd take this combo sporadically, whenever I could, not really giving the actual drugs a second thought. Then I looked up Lyrica and read the studies on how it was being used to combat anxiety.. with really positive results. 

So I actually went legit and had them prescribed, the dose being 150mg twice a day. I don't think I ever took the proper dose more than a few times.. I smashed through packets and loved feeling numb to everything. Fuck anxiety, no idea if I had it anymore or not.. I was too high to tell. 

Now I'm here.. hating this. On one hand I want to get down to 300mgs per day as first suggested by my doctor.. because I'm scared of going back to living in a black hole inside of my head.. but on the other hand, I want to get off this drug entirely. But then what? ?


I'm getting my Valium in 2 days. I know full well that it's a weakness of mine and I'm replacing one thing with another. I'm telling myself that it's for the withdrawals and while they might help, I know I'm just afraid to face life without some sort of crutch, some sort of manufactured happy... 

Which is shit.

I wish you good luck with benzos, they dont work on my symptomps. 2mg kpin can kill some anxiety for few hrs and give you another few hours sleep - but will not ease other wd's, especially from high doses. Thats why ppl tend to use kratom, ketamine whatever can help with depression, suicidal thoughts, ahedonia. But this is amplified to really bad point, i threw the towel on 75mg before after not getting better...10 days where i saw the dark side of darkness.


So went up and started titrating, still not fun, lower i get more wd's i feel but...benzos wont hit your dopamine receptors, wont alleviate depression. But through my own experience i agree - it was easier for me to kick benzodiazepines than lyrica.  Need force myself out of bed everyday to go work, shopping, basic stuff. No joy, no happiness, no  motivation. Its like this 6 weeks and counting. Still titrating....


Let us know please how you go doing Quickfixgrrl

Thanks [@Voiceoffear](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/516918/)


I took 1,350mgs of Lyrica within 12 hours yesterday.

I am completely dependent on it. 

I literally chewed them, just to taste the powder... I can't explain it ?

I love the "Lyrica jolts".. as I call them.. when I'm so intoxicated by it that I forget that I've actually taken them and my body/ muscles randomly jump..

I love the feeling of not being able to swallow.. another physical symptom I get.. It reminds me that the drug has flooded my system and I'm ok.. as long as I can feel SOMETHING other than my usual dread and anxiety..


Today I took 300 in the morning.. 150 midday and another 300 tonight... 

An improvement, for me...

750 is still 150mg higher than max recommended dose. So after few days please try 600mg in two am & pm doses. This way you ll get time regime and blood concentration.  Once you feel ok on 600 you can try a bigger drop, like 150mg. If it wont work - 75mg. Down to 150mg shouldnt be bad.

It definitely has that speedy effect (also not a fan of uppers), especially when your tolerance is low. I found I did start to actually enjoy that weird buzz, it makes me feel way less inhibited, I feel more social and can dive right into my day and tackle stuff I'd previously had no motivation for. 

I guess that's what kept me going back for more...

Lyrica makes me quite manic, in a very nice way.  It's like phenibut except phenibut also hits GABA-B receptors.  Both of them make me super social and fearless.  I don't have access to Lyrica and phenibut is less intoxicating anyway, but I take phenibut before I play shows (I'm in 2 bands) and it's very useful because I have no inhibitions and I get into the flow and play my best much more easily.  I wish I hadn't abused it for years because I get a couple of rebound days now about 2 days after I take it, but it's worth it.

I was starting to think it was just me having that reaction.  I already have high anxiety so i can't handle that rushy feeling like I could before.

I play keys (electric paino and synthesizer), and both bands are not really genre-specific.  My original band is all-instrumental and we call ourselves "progressive psychedelic space rock" for a genre.  It's all original stuff that we write as a group.  My newer band is a sort of amalgamation of rock, funk, and mountain folky stuff.

So I saw my doctor today to renew my prescriptions.. Lexapro, Valium and Lyrica. 

Turns out my pharmacist had contacted him regarding my early and frequent turnover of scripts ?

Thank fuck I have a super amazing doctor who I've been seeing for years and I managed to explain that whilst I'd been "occasionally" upping my dose, I still needed needed more in order to taper and also Valium to help me through that..

I got them and fuck, couldn't wait to try the Valium again after months without.. sweet, familiar benzo it it ❤

Still planning to cut down on the pregabalin. I've only taken 300mgs today and remarkably feel fine! ?☺

I also went in search of L theanine and lemon balm tea.. visited 2 drug stores and a health food store, none of which stocked them.

Anyhoo... 8 Valium under my tongue to help me sleep tonight ?


*Edit* ok... make that 16 now... I am, after all, Quick fix... ?

We can't talk about specific sources, but look for L-theanine and other supplements online in bulk, it's like 20 times cheaper than buying pill formulations at a store and way easier to get.  GNC would have that stuff but GNC is stupidly overpriced.

I just found this study about how L-theanine is effective against alcohol-related liver injury.  And some other articles about it helping to prevent liver disease.  Was the source of this information also selling an L-theanine supplement that had other things in it?

That is real messed up if you were only filling the 3 days early that they allow or whatever. Im gunna make sure to stop doing that my pharmacy is particularly c*nty for lack of a better word. I dont even mean to and probably get them late more often which im sure is a problem too but i live 40 minutes away from the damn pharmacy I aint gunna make a perfect 31. But Im going to make sure i go 31 + now because i dont need any of that nonsense.  Umm lyrica, not something I would use other than for opioid withdrawl, I guess that is my thought on that.  Glad your doctor has your back, I think mine does but I dont want to give him any (more) reason to doubt.

I used to get my 56 x 150mg filled once a week at the same pharmacist, who's older brother is my doctor. This went on for 2 repeats worth (dispensed 12 times) before anyone noticed. I was picking up 3 weeks early... Eventually, I cold turkeyed this dose and lost the fucking plot, ran in terror to my doctor and he just put me on 300mg x 2 a day. I've tapered down to 225mg a day. For some reason, much of the medical profession seem to disregard pregabalin as a dangerous and addictive drug though that seems to be changing...


I read some folks talking about kidney issues; I had a bad kidney infection at the same time as my cold turkey and the doc thought it was probably Lyrica. I guess it could cause kidney stones if it is allowing more free calcium to circulate the body. Aren't kidney stones basically calcium deposits or am I gibbering bullshit again? 


I've had a low platelet count the whole time I've been on this shit too...

Kidneys infection/stones are common with high doses of lyrica because the way this shit is processed. Unlike benzos and liver, lyrica in 90% is processed by kidneys so drinking plenty water decreases the risk.

I hate this stuFF I been nn 600mg for 8 years. not allowed to go any higher

and im tolerant im meant to take 200mg three times a day but have been taking 400mg and it only last 6 hours and if i go without i cant functin at all so much nerve pain and anxiety to max

Not one to take massive doses 600mg is plenty in one go for me, ive gone higher and felt very dissociated;

even gabapentin is horrible to come off and this stuff is ten times stronger

It is about 5x stronger and causes a mess. I became intolerant for a coffee now at around 30mg. One glass of martini super dry gives me relief during taper however i am not able to enjoy even a cup of coffee. I had one coffee yesterday and it kicked many wd's symptoms i havent had for ages. Now 24hrs later still feel some but improving. So stimulants are big no no whilst tapering. 


So since lyrica turns glutamate into gaba in cns logically there is not enough gaba in cns when drug is not present or not enough. I ordered some picamilon (gaba + niacin) which is able to cross bb barrier and in result there should be more gaba in cns.  I hope it helps, i really do. 30mg might sound stupidly low to even bother but i am too sensitive to it so will report whether it helps or not.

Heya guys.


How may one receive help for addiction / dependency in Australia? Specifically in Sydney, NSW.


I was prescribed two and a half years ago for severe chronic neckpain. The drug changed my life in ways I never could have expected; initially for the better, but later for the worse.


My tolerance hovers around 900mg daily and I have resorted to doctor shopping just to maintain the dependency, as the withdrawals make me suicidal. I have lost jobs, friends and family over this drug. The things it has made me do and turned me into, I do not wish upon anyone else. Whilst it feels good to not be in pain anymore, I feel as if my mental development has quite literally been stunted. (Started at 21, now 23); I once used to have an intelligent, funny circle of friends my age and now I just seem to be associating with mindless junkies. I've lost so much; I miss my friends and my life before all of this - Even if my pain was unbearable...


I desperately do not want to suffer the withdrawals again; I cannot lose this job. I have two more 150mg capsules left for tomorrow and that's that. I've exhausted all my scripts. My primary GP claims I am not allowed to get anymore for two months and I'm 1.5 months in. I've also used another doctor's 150mg script in the process. My doctor knows of my woes regarding my tolerance and previous abuse, and when I asked her what to do when it inevitably runs out, she told me to check myself into a mental health clinic and "act like I'm insane" - A funny joke for her, but not for me.


I need help. Are doctors obligated to give an emergency prescription here due to its known side-effects of abruptly stopping such as seizures? Maybe I can go to a hospital? I'm desperate. I don't want my "fix" anymore, I just want to be able to sustain myself until I can afford a proper mental health care plan as I have severe bipolar and ADHD of which I had been unknowingly self-medicating with using Lyrica and eventually the occasional dose of Adderall.


Before Lyrica I was a quiet, dorky 21 year old computer nerd who had a small, but strong circle of friends with prospects for a career and now I don't even know what I am. I've been an extraverted cunt to the people I love the most; a selfish, obnoxious dickbag who cares only about indulging in pleasure, pleasure and pleasure. I've become a dim-witted, impulsive idiot stimulant junkie.


I'm not who I was, I'm going nowhere in life and now I'm about to enter physical and mental hell once again with the withdrawals. Please. If anybody can help, I would appreciate any response...

Sounds like you need go to detox/rehab centre and get it sorted. You will go through hell ct, you will go through bad times trying taper from 900mg taken so long. 


You need medical supervision and restore your life.

I recently went through a week long binge of Lyrica (1600mg a day) to see how long it takes me to recover from such high dosses. Having Gabapentin helps tremendously when going through Lyrica withdrawal. The only issue is you need constant dossing of 600mg or 800mg tablets every couple hours in order to even feel normal.


If anyone here is having trouble kicking Lyrica then trying switching to Gabapentin. Start from a high dose and make your way down to the bare minimum. Tolerance goes down very quickly so you shouldn't need to be taking such high dosses of it for very long.


EDIT


If anyone is wondering. I was on Lyrica for two years prior to me obtaining the Gabapentin from my PCP. It was much easier to switch then due to the significantly lower dosage.

How are you feeling, mate? Fwiw, I've been on exactly that position, was doctor shopping (well, 2 doctors), one of whom would write me a script whenever I wanted. Of course, ended up on 1200mg a day, doctors found out, went cold turkey, lost my absolute shit completely and went back to the good doctor (Not the pill happy one) who put me on 600mg a day, collecting the capsules every two days. This was 9 months ago and I've tapered (with help from my doctkr) to 150mg a day. It's been rough but at this stage I am feeling so so so so much better than I did. 


You need to get your doctor on board. Be totally honest, ask for restricted access to the medication so they know you are not going to abuse it and stick this out. If this cannot happen, you need to detox in a safe place. You will recover and life will start up again for you. 


You can do it ❤ Please feel free to PM me or reply back if you need advice...

Hey pal. That doesn't sound too good. I've been an idiot with lyrica in the past. But I kept some useful (for me) diary entries detailing what I went through. A lot of people, but not everyone, find the first withdrawal the easiest and subsequent ones get harder. I noticed that in my notes years ago, and I'm feeling it again coming off phenibut (lyrica's near identical sibling). I'm on day 6 of a cold turkey stop and it's not fun. I noticed that there was a point with lyrica where the goodness from it just stopped working. That in those early days I could watch complex movies and easily understand them. But all that turned around. It made me lazy, boring, I lost the ability to focus on tasks, my vision also went blurry.


It all passed. Each one lasted 2 weeks. It's unlike opiate withdrawal, it's not a "bit better each day" type thing. It's all over the place. It's weird AF. 3 days into my phenibut CT I caught myself crying over how happy I was. The next day I made arrangements to go to the ER room due to gigantic anxiety levels and attacks. It's just like it stops working at one point, the withdrawals also stop at one point. Then that's it. You'll know they passed.


Maybe get yourself checked in at hospital for mental health reasons. I've had a friend do that before. She was in a bad place with, well everything in her life, she couldn't cope. So she was honest with the doc and was treated. They found she had some mild but untreated mental illnesses. Since then she got therapy, some mild meds and is now a-OK.


And also please update us on your experience. I find reading other peoples experiences helps a fuck load, even if they're negative. And if they do help you out you can bet it'll help others too ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


It'll all pass. Do see your doc. I was recently honest with mine and I gotta say, even though it wasn't in my favor I still feel good getting it out there. (I was buying meds online and was having trouble getting off them. I thought I'd NEVER be able to tell anyone IRL about that other than my wife. But there I did it. Hours later I got a phone call from a drugs emergency sorter-outer team leader person and made an appointment to sort my life out. All that because I spoke out when I should have. Now I just feel dumb for not doing it sooner.

I've put myself in a hole. Again.

I don't have my usual ability to explain what went wrong this time, but I need some advice...

I have 13 x 150mg pills left (picked up 2 packs of 56 within 2 weeks plus 2 x 50 5mg Valium) and cannot go back to my doctor this time for help.. I'm not "due" for more of anything until August. I've somehow managed to suss out incompetent pharmacies (usually, one did report me) and have somehow just eaten through the lot.

For the past 48 hours I've gone from insanely high daily doses (up to 1,950, 13 pills a day on my worst days).. but usually around 900...) to desperately trying to space out what I have left now.. Tuesday I took just the one 150mg pill ?.. yesterday I took 300mg.

Right now it's Thursday morning and I'm frantic. I want with every fibre of me to swallow everything I have left because of the withdrawals.. I'm literally pacing my house (thankfully I have the next 3 days off work) after a fitful sleep drowning in my own sweat, crying and fighting off suicidal thoughts.

I've taken just one pill today.

13 left.

What the fuck should I do? Is a taper possible with what I have? I want this over with quickly, obviously.. but at the same time don't want to leave myself with none until August..

I know this isn't possible and that's further driving my anxiety...

Help? Please?

Edit.. also have no Valium left, which isn't a problem for me in terms of withdrawal but would have been helpful right now...

Just to clarify, my desire is to be able to stick to a prescribed dose because it works so well for my general state of headfuckery. My reality is... I can't. I can't just "take 2 pills" of anything that I find can get me out of myself and escape a little bit. It's not something I plan, even when I get a fresh box.. I think to myself "this time I'll be good"...

Within days I'm taking an extra here and there.. then a shitload.. it's erratic, depending on my mood. 

Oh well. Looks like I've fucked myself up good and proper right now.

Did i read somewhere that you consume kratom? It will do th3 trick but better order if one wants to give it a go... if it gets buried in a hurricane of politics.

IME

Works wonders for pain and "headfuckery".

Krayom is really in it's own class (IMO) and highly recommended (by me: DR. Love).

Not a doctor....


Have to edit: Going through benzo and opiate WD on the couch not moving and didnt wanna be bothered or move (this was a coupla years ago).

Acquired some kratom and first dose was half a gram (after almost two years I am up to 1 1/2g and this sustains me). In about an hour I got up and mowed the lawn in blazing heat. I felt OK and the WDs were at bay somewhat. I was a fucking mess before kratom.

Do not understand the mindset of taking an ounce or more of this stuff. Does it not have a "ceiling" effect at some point in dosing?

OMG Quickfixgrrl, thats not good at all. There is no way you can safely taper off such a doses with whats left. You need more lyrica or wd's will hit you hard. Like some1 mentioned earlier - 2 weeks with no improvement every day. I got myself through it once for over 6-7 days and gave in - and i think it was just 50-60% what it could be.  


The only way is taper, nothing works good enough. Kratom may take an edge off it but won't stop glutamate and nonadrenaline storm through open calcium channels (lyrica inhibits those VDCC). Its very risky and you need find more lyrica.

I was the same- unable to change my usage at all, even with strict plans and good intentions. I thought I could cold turkey from 1200-1500mg a day- I couldn't, I lost my shit. Couldn't even figure out a pair of pants. 


I went to my doctor and asked him to help me- I asked him to organise a script whereby I picked up a set amount from a pharmacy every 2 days. That way, I only ever had limited supply and even if I ate 2 days worth at once, I wasn't going to be too fucked by it. It has been the only way I could get onto my current 150mg a day. 


Can you do something like this?

IMO, gabapentlin, pregabalin and phenbut are all drugs that should be taken every 3 days at absolute maximum.  Using this pattern, you can avoid dependence and keep the magical nature of the effects going indefinitely.  Even every 3 days, with phenibut anyway, produces a very light withdrawal but it's just kind of feeling flat and having it hard to sleep for a day or two to stop.  I see so many people hating on these drugs, but what do you expect if you take something every day hat's addictive?  You're gonna get addicted.  I love pregabalin, I've only done it 3 or 4 times.  I love gabapentin, I do it on occasion when I have taken phenibut less than a week before, for the purposes of playing music.  I use phenibut to play shows as long as I stick to once a week or less.  They're amazing drugs, especially phenibut.  I really can't have enough good things to say about it based on my experience.  Absolutey 0 social anxiety, very pro-social, I feel "on point", I play better than ever before, and I feel eupohoric and chatty, and best of all, not inebriated.

The same thing happened with benzos... oh, check out this new thing to replace barbiturates, i won't accidentally kill you and it's totally non-habit forming!  Some doctors still actually believe that, probably not many now though.  Or with oxycodone, it was touted as a nonaddictive alternative to hydrocodone.  Yeah, my neft nut. 8)  Or GHB, too, when it was sold as Blue Rhino in GNC and stuff as a workout supplement.  They claimed it was nonaddictive, yet clearly it is.  With phenibut too, people were claiming it's like GHB but non-addictive.  Also bogus.  I sense a pattern...  ![:unsure:](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f914.png) ![:unsure:](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f914.png)

Yeah, I do see that sort of pattern being played out with pregabalin for sure. When I first got it prescribed the doctor literally said it *cannot* be addictive because it doesn't enter the brain. I mean, wtf is with that? They're getting clued up now though but it amazes me that I as a lay person can elucidate more about this drug simply using Google than they can using info provided by the pharmaceutical companies themselves. That ignorance can end up fatal to some patients. ?


The problem with selling medications under our economic system is the great incentive to market addictive drugs. Repeat customers are precisely what a growing corporation needs and the rewards are incredible. Thats a compelling reason for the continued pushing of really problematic drugs (for some users, at least) often by intentionally overlooking or downplaying the clear and evident problems their products are causing. I really wish that more information had been provided to me about pregabalin, not that it would probably have changed my ultimate headfirst dive into it. I think cataloguing the issues it and other gabapentinoids may induce is really the only option we have when drug companies will willfully conceal the reality of drugs they are pushing.

Yeah. Different story is taking it once a week and different when doctors get you hooked on it claiming: ,, Its safe and non-addictive, you can stop it whenever you want". And then you ending up in shit place because for some individuals taper lyrica is harder than benzos. I know that now and changed my doctor.

I found a small orange pill broken in half in my old pill box.. I remember weaning myself off of Mirtazapine in like 2017 so assumed it was that. Didn't think it could hurt so I chewed it up. Within half an hour I was out like a light. I recall being on the max dose of it but it never having that effect on me. I guess it's because I chewed it? My whole mouth went numb, too. 

At least I have slept through today. 

Feeling flat right now and dreading sleep tonight, the night sweats have been so intense even though it's winter here...

Like some1 mentioned earlier - 2 weeks with no improvement every day. I got myself through it once for over 6-7 days and gave in - and i think it was just 50-60% what it could be.

Lyrica inhibits calcium channels so it blocking flow of other neurotransmitters. Like a brake similar to benzo that binds to gaba-a. When drug is not present in channels means it opens and glutamate and others flooding brain causing wd's. Additionally lyrica converts glutamate into gaba through decarboxylaze,  thats why you feel calm - you have loads gaba and not much glutamate. When drug is not present there is not enough gaba (your body stops making endogenous)to stop glutamate storm = withdrawals.

Story time! I had an appointment with a group that helps folks come off meds yesterday. They a bit foolishly imo told me to stop taking everything, go into multi med withdrawal until Monday when they’ll sort me out. They said if things get intense to go to hospital. So I did at 9pm. My mental health massively fell apart waiting to be seen at 3am. Finally got in. 


I’ve been withdrawing from phenibut. I didn’t want to explain what that was to rushed doctors so I just said I was coming off Pregabalin. He gave me a 300mg pill. went to bed. Woke at midday high as a fucking pigeon. I well expected cross tolerance. Oh well! It’s still in effect now. I’m having no more of these gaba things now but this was a nice ending to it.

When I first found phenibut, a long time ago, I was taking about 3-4 grams every day for a year.  I ran out and couldn't get more at the time and started having shitty withdrawals, it was mostly just crippling anxiety, but in any case it sucked.  But my friend happened to send me some 150mg Lyricas.  I took 2, and 3 hours later I had no withdrawals and I was incredibly, amazingly high, some of the best euphoria I've ever felt.  Lyrica will definitely stop phenibut withdrawals.  Worked for about 2 days, then I took another dose, 2 more days, then I took my last dose, and I pretty much felt fine and didn't keep taking either one after that.  I started using phenibut again later in life though, but never every day (it's once a week these days).

Day 4. 150mgs today. Headache. Fatigue. Low/depressed mood. Shakes. Random jolts of panic. Extremely poor vision. 

The night sweats are awful. 

I'm doing this. I'm just going to do the only thing that makes sense to me with the pills I have left.. keep up the 150mg for the next few days and then use 75mg for the last remaining and just deal with it. 

I'm not getting back on the Lyrica train come August. This is not worth it. I can't put myself through this again. 

If I get my hands on a new script I know deep down I'll abuse it, good intentions or not. I can't trust myself. 

Looking forward to going back to work after the weekend and keeping myself busy. 

I need weed... :/

Stop it cold turkey, take some diatsepam for 1 week , shouldnt cause any wd's, also if you can get take ketamine (without benzos), it will correct youre mood at least for 2 weeks. Not advicing because can cause addiction, GHB will help a lot, lets say 4 day daily use (24h in youre bloodstream dosing every 1-2h) shouldnt cause wd's it helps best. IF you haven't used pregabalin too long the wd's should go away in 1 week, but for depression really get ketamine, there are studies for this.


I used pregabalin daily 1-5g sometimes 2g, but alwasy at least 1g for 4 months without breaks, the wdäs were terrible, so I drunk alcohol 4 days straight, then the worst part went away, yes high doses alcohol will mast the wd's, but there is risk of getting hooked to alcohol. Now I use pregabalin only few times a month, never over 3 days, if I take 5 days 1g doses I get mild wd's for 5 days. Now when I take them I never take over 600mg, my tolerance have dropped, so now just 300mg have good effect, sweet spot is 450mg, I never want to get wd's again, few montsh back I used 10 days pregabalin 1g and then switched to phenibut 5g day. Well got 1 week wd's, not so bad but then I used opioids and speed to take of teh w wd's. Pregabalin is fun only when used rarely.


Best luck.

I dont even mean to and probably get them late more often which im sure is a problem too but i live 40 minutes away from the damn pharmacy I aint gunna make a perfect 31. But Im going to make sure i go 31 + now because i dont need any of that nonsense.  Umm lyrica, not something I would use other than for opioid withdrawl, I guess that is my thought on that.  Glad your doctor has your back, I think mine does but I dont want to give him any (more) reason to doubt.

I like to alternate pharmacies for exactly that reason. It looks like I’m filling my script 4 weeks late instead of 2 days early. They check the national database to see if it triggers an alarm, but they can only see my last fill from when I last went to that chain of pharmacies.

(That’s in the USA)

Does pregabalin and gabepntin work in different wayin brains? For me gabapentin is somehow more euphoric, with lyrica I don't get much euphoria anymore, only after 6 month break. I took 2 days ago 600mg pregabalin but no euphoria, now I've taken 2400mg gabapentin and it feels vwery nice and euphoric, like phenibut after long break. Also phenibut works different way than pregabalin.

I don't think any of these drugs are fully understood.  gabapentin and pregabalin are different drugs, so even though they both work on the same system, the effects are different, sort of like how hydrocodone and oxycodone both work on opioid receptors but are different in effect.  Some people find hydro more euphoric and some find oxy more euphoric.  I imagine it's the same thing here.

Phenibut actually works not only as a gabapentinoid, but as a strong GABA-B receptor agonist.  So it actually is working on 2 different brain systems at once.

Ah yes I see, I've read that gabapentin WD's are also much lighter than pregabalin.


I tried 250mg naproxen with gabapentin and it clearly makes more gabapentin get absorbed, it works in system for 9 hours, so all the gabepentin you take in that period should have increased absorption. Not sure if 500mg (max reccomended dose of naproxen) will help even better. Also not sure about soda drinks I've always take that too but there isn't any scientific studies on it, so maybe just placebo. On naproxen there is studies saying that it helps both gabapentin and pregabalin to get better absorbed. So you can take less of them and save some meds.

GHB in high doses also is  GABA-B receptor agonist so thats why phenibut often feels like GHB, tho I find phenibut more euphoric when haven't took it long times and it gives great feeling dreams too. Last time with phenibut I went to some kind of nodding state and felt very strong euphoria, almost like strong opioid nodding, strangely when not nodding I didn't get that strong euphoria. Phenibut is weird drug, like other gabapinoids,

Yeah exactly.  Phenibut and GHB have a lot of similarities, I think of phenibut kind of as the methadone of GHB.  It's more functional, lasts WAY longer, and is not nearly as intense of a peak.  Of course it's not just like a weaker, longer-lasting GHB.  GHB hits GHB receptors, and phenibut is a gabapentinoid.  But they're more similar to each other than they are to any other drugs IMO.

yeah I went off alcohol years ago. I just hate it now - it makes me feel bloated and the hangovers are awful. Maybe it's because I'm older now


Pregabalin is nicer, but the only problem is the rapid tolerance. I can take several grams and not feel much at all when I have toelrance.


 What doses do you take?

I've only had pregabalin a few times.  The first time, I was withdrawing from phenibut, and took 300mg.  It was one of the best highs I've had in my life, I had incredible amounts of euphoria, and I could not stop talking.  I had orgasmic pulses through the ends of my fingers and toes.  I was quite physically intoxicated and spent a lot of time with my eyes closed, feeling like I was drifitng through clouds.  It was incredible.  I did it a few more times and had similar effects but a lot less intense.  I find it very euphoric (moreso than most things), and fairly physically intoxicating.  It's like gabapentin on steroids, to me.

300-450mg. today i ate 900mg throughout and know im fixin to chill as the last one was about 30 min ago.

i do lyrica as most substances... once in a while. sometimes i grab 10x300mg and it lasts about 3 days. then its time to do something else for a minute. like music... i dont care a whole lot about one style... i like a little bit of everything. digression.

Yup. i saw a post where you mentioned the receptor activity gotta check that out again. fairly new to lyrica (get the name brand > go figure) and love it.

as posted i hate the hangovers and '[ingest all that liquid to get where i wanna be. also alcohol wasn't too much of an issue as a kid (except when dealing with johnny law) but now... days feeling like shit. i *may *drink 2-3 times a year with my buds. if there is no one to socialize with i dont drink (which is my daily routine). no socializing and no alcohol. there are other options that IMO are safer and less toxic to the body and mind.

I believe Lyrica is only available (in the USA anyway) as name brand because the patent is owned by I think Pfizer and not enough time has passed yet to make it legal to develop generics.

absolutely. But the Powers that Be don't agree, which is why the safer drugs are all illegal.


Anyway, another thing about Pregabalin is I think it works better on an empty stomach. But the tolerance issue means it's something that only really works if I use it once every week or two weeks

First time in my life when I took pregabalin 300mg gave me also very strong feeling, But now I need 600mg if I've had at leas 6 months break with 3 month break need 1050mg. Gabapentin and pregabalin does nto sem to have very stron cross-tolerance as after 3 day 600mg pregabalin binge I got very euphoric effects from 2,4g gabapaentin after 1 day break from pregabalin.

That's odd, I'd think they'd have a strong cross-tolerance as they're working by the same mechanism.

If I take gabapentin 3 days row on 1,5g dose/day and have 3-4 days break, is it enough not to get physically depended on it ? Going to use it for wd from opioids, but not wanting to get addicted to gabas, I use benzos on these 3-4 day breaks. Does pregabalin make you much faster physically dependable than gabapentis, so it's better to use gabas than pregs for wd's?

Liver doesn't hurt or give you pain. Could be gallbladder, pancreas or most likely intestines. They dont like pregab in them.

^ I believe you can experience pain from an enlarged liver in that it can push on the surrounding muscles.


The pain was in my upper right abdomen, so unlikely to be the intestine.


 I guess it could be the pancreas or gall. Does Pregabalin actually go into those two organs though?

Yes, when you ve got fatty enlarged liver so intoxicated can swallow further. But not with pregab:


,,In humans, less than 2% of pregabalin is metabolized and it is excreted virtually unchanged in the urine"


So ot could irritate your pancreas, stomach or gall but yes, some people with intestines infection can feel the pain around rib cage, also on right hand side.


Do your blood work man.

For me, the effects of gabapentin are quite different to pregabalin which leads me to think the MOA isn't quite the same. I don't actually think the drug companies have been  entirely honest about how these compounds work and they are the source of the main literature out there.


For me, gabapentin did not relieve full fledged Lyrica withdrawal. I also went through a several day binge on gabapentin and ended up with rebound weirdness that Lyrica didn't relieve very well either. 


I'm thinking that physical biochemistry plays  huge role in how these drugs effect so many people quite differently.

It is safer than combining benzos and opiates, you are not likely to experience dangerous respiratory depression but the disinhibitjng effects of both will subergise and add to each other. I would say that lower doses of each drug are relatively safe but stay low. Probably increase tolerance more this way than using the drugs separately. 


I've added benzos to Lyrica a number of times and it was nothing special, just messy stupid brain shit and no memory to speak of. I don't think it's something you want to do regularly but from.time to time, at low doses, you should be okay. Just take less of each and see how you feel and don't add any other CNS depressants.

She did yes, the whole idea was to give me something I could use daily along with benzos to keep benzo usage spread out. Benzos (from my understanding) don't increase GABA levels, just sensitize the receptors, whereas Lyrica is an analog IIRC. So really there isn't a whole lot going on, definitely not the same as mixing two depressants of different classes.


Just Lyrica: Felt nothing even at 300mg 2x a day

Lyrica + Klonopin: Really only felt the Klonopin

Lyrica + Klonopin + Alcohol: Probably not a good idea (and not ok'd by doc), but it drastically reduced that feeling of needing "another one", as 2 beers already felt doubled.

Thanks I will always start with low doses. I don't find either drug does much on its own to be honest. Diazepam does nothing, and Pregabalin when I had no tolerance was a little intoxicating and disinhibiting. But it seems like no amount of time waiting gets zero-tolerance back again for Preg...

I don't have an intestinal infection as far as I know. All I know is I took some pregabalin (more than I usually do as I was chasing the tolerance - stupid of me) and the next day got some noticeable pain in the location of my liver, although it's died away now

A side effect of pregabalin can be bloating and gassiness. It's not uncommon to feel gas pains as a pretty intense sensation. And it doesn't need processing by the liver per se so it's unlikely to be causing any issues there. It does seem to effect kidneys to some extent though...

Actually, that just means it doesn't get metabolized into something else, not that only 2% reaches your brain.  Some drugs get excreted unchanged even though they affect you, for example, the active compound in Amanita muscaria mushrooms.  In fact you can drink your urine and keep redosing yourself on the same mushrooms.  Sounds like that's probably true with pregabalin too, at least if that line you quoted is true.

I haven't replied to this thread for a while.. I was weaning off pregabalin and let me tell you... what a headfuck. 

The anxiety sent me out of control. The depression was a nightmare. 

So 3 days ago I reached for alcohol. Ended up face planting into something, don't even recall what.. 15 stitches across my eyebrow and temple. 

I changed my meds yesterday.. now back on the Lyrica, plus Mirtazapine and Ativan. 

Happy days.

After this incident, I ate 50 5mg valium in 3 days. I've been pretty much comatose, which is exactly what I wanted. 

I'm done. I hate alcohol with a passion. Hopefully the Mirtazapine and Ativan will fix my broken mind ?

Woah [@Quickfixgrrl](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/521697/) that's crazy, I'm glad you're okay. 


Dunno how quick your taper was or from high dose but it needs to take place over months ime. I find the anxiety utterly impossible if I reduce too quickly, I'm cutting about once a month or so. Still get withdrawal but on the milder end and it wears off after about a week. 


I think pregabalin has really impacted my ability to control stress and anxiety though. I started a new job and it's something I've got the qualification for and experience in but the anxiety has been really intense and largely focused on whether I am.going to be anxious or have sudden withdrawal symptoms... anxiety about anxiety is really fucking stupid. ?

I agree. I was taking it short-term but found it really addictive. It is taking me a bit longer weaning it off than time i was on therapeutic dose. But i had no choice and remain functional - skills set + focus + analytical thinking. Dont know how i ve survived this taper so far. But im at the very end. Slow, patient taper feeling like crap every day. There is no need speeding it up, wd's are awful.

Anxiety and depression are often fobbed off... advice like "try breathing exercises..." "you'll be ok, just go for a walk".. "take a bath and light some candles"... 

Anxiety feels like a demon sitting in your chest. Every day tasks are unbearable.  Waking up mid panic attack but forcing yourself to go to work... the feeling of impending doom and catastrophe ever present..

It's a fucking misunderstood, horrible affliction ???

I haven't ever withdrawn from pregabalin, but phenibut withdrawal reminds me of what you're describing.  I find myself entering anxiety mode about the dumbest shit, and I'll have to catch myself or it'll cascade into greater and greater anxiety.   Stuff that would never make me anxious normally.  It's weird.

Some drugs get excreted unchanged even though they affect you, for example, the active compound in Amanita muscaria mushrooms.  In fact you can drink your urine and keep redosing yourself on the same mushrooms.  Sounds like that's probably true with pregabalin too, at least if that line you quoted is true.

[@Xorkoth](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/77889/)  sorry for the gore ? 

They initially thought I'd be needing plastic surgery but thankfully a really great doctor walked in, looked at me and said "I can fix that"... and he did!

I am lucky.. it definitely could have been a lot worse being so close to my eye..

Same here. I distinctly remember my first panic attack.. I would have been about 8 or 9. I started seeing a child psychologist but the problem was my home life so nothing he suggested worked because the shit happening at home continued. 

I've had 3 nervous breakdowns, the last one being December of last year. I lost my job over it. 

I had a good run after my daughter was born.. I was in my early 30's and had a few years of bliss. Then a lot of stressful occurrences that happened within months brought me back down. 

Thing is, I'd never sought out any medications.. I was very apprehensive but finally gave in and started off with Lexapro. That was 3 years ago and it's done sweet fuck all, obviously. I started weaning off of that just yesterday. 

The Mirtazapine will replace it and Lorazepam when needed. Also the Lyrica, of which I'm taking 300mgs split in 2 doses per day. I can't be an idiot with it anymore and gobble up 1000mg + per day anymore. I need to really get better and do things the right way. And for a pill happy addict, that's going to be hard but I just have to..

The benzo/opiate combo is bad because one stops your breathing and the other makes you sleep. So the combo puts you into a coma and you don’t breathe at all.

Benzos and Pregablin both make you sleep, so they’re safe together. The one thing to look out for though is that high doses of Pregablin can cause vomiting. That is really bad if the benzos put you into a deep sleep on your back and you choke on your own vomit.

I often take way more than 1000mg of Pregabalin and it still does nothing. I think the tolerance builds so fast and then it's permanent so Preg doesn't work any more


I've been on several SSRIs and they did nothing really except some unpleasant side effects. I think they're just placebos. Good luck and I hope things work out for you

I really started on it to sleep during oxy wd. But it gives me insomnia after even a couple days use. SO now I have been on it for a few months and I really need to get off of it, sooner than later.

I’m desperately scared of PAWS from Lyrica

man I went on a lyrica binge for I don't know how long (maybe a coupla weeks). Started at 300 and ended at 900-1200 throughout the day.

What a freakin' comedown. Didn't realize what was going on until I snapped at my SO and I immediately knew something was off balance. Have some gabapentin and xanax but at 200mg gabapentin (at work) for the last three days. .5 xanax if needed but using it sparingly (2mg first day... .5mg every couple days at bedtime). Phenibut has helped but keeping usage at normal so I don't fuck that up. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Just saying love the effects but will be a while before I mess with it again. Got enough issues. LOL!

Maybe use it for a couple days next time and wait another few months.

FWIW

It's safe as long as your dosages are what you are tolerant to. I was prescribed temazepam and pregabalin daily for a couple few years and would always take 200-300mg of Lyrica at night along with my 15mg temazepam. I'd be careful if driving or just being out in public because the benzo will feel much stronger.

Anyone tried flush niacin B3 to speed up recovery or taper? It helps with benzo wd's, come across few reports that it improves blood flow in brain and is beneficial as neuroprotector.

I have experience of withdrawing from gabapentin (the sister drug to pregablin). It was prescribed for neural pain that lasted about a year. The one day I mentioned to my doc that I thought it helped my anxiety too (which we all know because it is used for that). She reacted very badly and claimed I was abusing the gabapentin since it was prescribed for neural pain, yet I was saying it helped me with something else. Personally I thought we were "killing two birds with one stone" so was stunned by her reaction.


She drew up a "rapid taper" for me lasting about a week. We had a bit of an argument because I pointed out that at the early stages the reductions were like 10%, but towards they end they become 50%. She told me it wasn't addictive (!!!), and it was all in my head (where else would you expect anxiety to be?!).


I started the taper and it was awful. Within days I was a nervous wreck. I saw a different doctor and showed him her rapid taper plan. He asked why it had to be so fast? I said I had no idea. So we agreed to slow it down and do it over about a month rather than a week. His other advice was get used to each reduction before moving onto the next. If I wasn't ready for the next cut then I should plateau for a few days and then make the cut. The rule seemed to be that a plateau is fine, but never take your dose back up (which I understand). In the end it took 5 weeks and was fine.


My take home message is that a taper is not a race. The prize is finishing it, not the speed at which you do it. I hope my experience maybe helps someone else.

Wow that sucks.  Doctors are so afraid of people abusing their medications that you mention it helps your anxiety in addition to your pain (ie, it's working fantastically) and they remove you from the drug entirely, thus removing both benefits?  Makes no sense.  Euphoria is a listed side effect of gabapentin, and it is sometimes prescribed for anxiety relief.

8mg as a result of taper. Down from 300mg/day. Same benzo taper rule applies when you are badly hooked on it. This way i managed avoid wd's and remain functional. Easy to get below 50mg and then had to hold for a bit after each cut. I read enough stories that people jumped off at 50 or 25mg and suffered paws for long enough time. Nothing wrong with slower taper, like nothing wrong with tapering phenibut, baclofen, benzos, antidepressants etc.

6 days off. Feeling better with each day. Bit spaced out and slight brain fog but no anxiety, no big depression, no tremors or shakes. Remember how i failed with fast taper. Strongly recommending slow taper to very low dose.

I'm supposed to be cutting out my afternoon dose starting from today.. I am currently taking 150mg 3 times per day, morning/noon/ night.  This is the most steady I've ever been with this drug. I planned on 450mg per day for a week, 300mg for 2 weeks and then going on just 150.

But I'm absolutely terrified. I have just come out of those withdrawals from excessively and erratic high daily doses. I'm extremely reluctant to go through it all again if I cut out the mid day dose... but at the same time I know that I need to taper down if I ever want to be rid of this. 

I have valium and usually I'd have eaten through all of them within days. I'm doing very well in that regard, I have left them alone and will only use them for chronic anxiety if/when it hits. I also work in a field that requires me to be alert and Valium always make me drowsy; I work 5 days a week so starting another taper seems impossible ?

I've tried to get my hands on L theanine and have checked health food stores and pharmacies but it seems unavailable in my country.. the chemist actually said he'd never even heard of it ?

I guess I might drop 75mgs.. I'll have to open up the capsules and dissolve half in water.. is that how it's done?

When I did mine I just used clear capsules and started splitting, you would be surprised at how many times you can split one of those little capsules.

I think you need to stabilise your daily intake before this will come even close to succeeding. If you have just 'recovered' from a withdrawal episode, I think its prudent to give yourself at least 2 weeks of taking the same amount each day at the same time before reducing it. 


I'd also really suggest being cautious with the valium- there is definitely some  cross tolerance and synergism between two despite having different MOAs. Using lots of valium will probably make your taper more difficult and risk protracting the withdrawal. 


Pregabalin is easily the worst drug I've ever used. Though I gotta say, the terrible withdrawal has made me deeply question drug use in general so maybe it will turn out to be a good thing.

I didn't know that about the cross tolerance, thank you for that info. What about Ativan?

I'll keep up the 450mg for another week. 

Absolutely agree with you regarding Pregabalin.. dark days ?

One challenge I've encountered is lacking the words to describe the withdrawal. Like, anxiety doesn't quite seem right- it's fucking there alright but there is that overlay of trippy weirdness and really odd thought loops and outright bafflement. During my last and worst high dose withdrawal, I could not figure out how a pair of fucking pants functioned- the material just felt like sandpaper, I had the impression of parts of my legs also being a little bit 'arm-like', there seemed to be way too many holes to put my feet through. Incredibly confusing and scary and this was just trying to get dressed. ?

The literature would say there is no cross tolerance between benzos and pregabalin because they don't bind to the same receptors but I do not think that is the whole story with Lyrica. So yeah, I think there is cross tolerance between Ativan and Lyrica. 


Try and stay at 450 for longer if you can- when did this withdrawal clusterfuck that you're recovering from happen?

Quickfixgrrl, remember one important thing when reducing - lyrica has 6 hrs half life so at some point when you end up with one capsule you will very likely experience interdose wd's. So stick to 3x daily and do small cuts from one dose each time. You ll end up splitting capsule when you got low. In some countries the smallest capsule is 75mg, its waaay to high to try jump off without wd's and paws. For me its like jumping off 1-1.5mg ativan and hoping wd's wont be bad.


Since lyrica capsules contain fillers is hard to split powder in same doses. Thats why best method is disolve let say 150mg capsule in 150ml warm water and progress with drops using syringe. I ve been there, i tried fast taper, i tried jump off 75mg, total physical and mental mess. Slow water titration taper saved my ass and probably future. 10th day lyrica free, still low but not as bad as i was during taper.

Just wanted to share my experience with what was sold to me as 4 methyl pregablin. I am a big fan of gabapentoids and intentionally sought this one out. I have a like permanent tolerance for lyrica and I take it at about 2-3g per dose 2x month. The chemical is supposedly 2x 3x more potent then lyrica. I did an allergy test of 20mg and a further test of 200mg without issue. With a week of tolerance break in between I took 2g orally. My expectations were not high as I was not sure the substance was as advertised. Sure enough though 2 hours later I took a couple hits of a vape pen and began feeling the gabapentoid electric type energy creep up on me. Over the next hour or so this feeling increased and I had all the desired effects of pregablin (mainly that electric energy) and the mdma ish talkativeness and empathy. It felt very similar to pregablin and I am not 100% confident that it wasn't just that. It did seem to have a smoother overall effect especially with side effects. Normally if I was feeling this good off of lyrica I would get the uncontrollable twitches of my limbs which I was happy not get the energetic feeling also seemed much stronger. Imo I think it was 4 methyl pregablin and it proved to be a little more potent and smooth.

Been speaking to people that I know this week who have tried Lyrica.. not one of them enjoyed the effects. I'm the same, there's no euphoria anymore, just weird, out of yourself kind of speedy and restless. 

I much prefer the combo of Lyrica, Endone and Ritalin, taken together. If you're looking for a nice, albeit "enjoyable fucked up" high, this combo is the best.

Im the same. Was prescribed lyricas with benzos for 4 years and after stopping daily using everytime I did them I got weird ass speedy anxiety and would often enter the psychosis zone when taking with benzos. I have had a lot of head injuries though, so that might have something to do with how drugs affect me.

I’m currently working on a nice and slow taper off 200mg daily Lyrica. I can feel the drop to 150 mg. It’s hard to explain, I just don’t feel right. And it hasn’t gone away after a couple of weeks. I can’t imagine cold turkey from 4 grams.

Lower you get more wd's you ll feel. Slow patient taper, suggesting even smaller drops (instead of 50mg and wait till you stabilise try cut 4-5mg ED or EOD). You may catch up quicker and wd's will be less intense.


I did a little mistake and after been clean for 4 weeks i used phenibut 500mg twice a week (sunday and thursday). Thought its safe. Nope. Dealing with like mild post-lyrica wd's- irritability, confusion, anxiety. Well, lesson learned.


How you doing [@Quickfixgrrl](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/521697/) ?

I think I have finally gotten off lyrica withdrawals. Took 10 weeks or something like that.

I can now again feel without lyrica like I did on lyrica.

Never taking this shit again even if Id fucking love to.

Dont ruin yourselves with this shit. The absolute worst thing you can do is stop this medication and then keep taking it from time to time imho!

Oh good to know, i was hoping use it sparingly for benzo paws one day but now i ll stay away from it. This is no medication, nothing really affected me so badly like this poison - memory, cognitive functions, no emotions, zombie mode.


I was doing better at 4 weeks off but had couple important social events so used just twice and only small phenibut doses but comedown hit me like lyrica wd's (i hope it won't last long).

[@Voiceoffear](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/516918/)  I'm not doing too well to be honest. I do great with my dosage for a week or so and then I start up gobbling them all up again.

I am addicted to a substance that doesn't even make me feel good ? It's fucked up.

I have started taking L- theanine powder so hopefully that can at least stabilize me a little for the inevitable withdrawals.

try mulungu definitely workds better than l-theanine. but you need a good batch and pulverized at best so you can swallow it whole. but sieve it beforehand so there arent any sharp objects in you intestines. with really good mulungu a only needed 2 g with bad at least 10g im not sure about crosstolerance though

has anyone ever used memantine to com off gabapentioids? it seens somewhat promising but also can increase anxiety and seizure threshol. or anything other dissoicativ. By the way Trimipramine can be really helpful für Gabapentinoid WDs as long as it doesnt cause RLS and there is protection against seizures. (Benzo, Carbamazepine or samething like that depending on the doese)

I think I should be one of the few persons that tried Memantine on Pregabalin; I wasn't taking the former to stop taking Pregabalin, but I can tell you that if you are used to psychedelics trips, you should try this combo -and stop taking Pregabalin later. It wakes you up in a weird way, but it also fucks up your balance too, so be careful.

Yeah i did exactly that friday night.i was already drunk and wasnt event using a scale just eyeballing mit a 10mg spoon (20 of them or something likes this) so i dont know how much i actually took. but believe me i was wasted as fuck, i wasnt even able connect a speaker cable to my pc. was the most confusing experience of my life and felt it even 2 days later. was kinda afraid to have a psychotic break but luckily i had some benzos. now the really interesting part is that this experience seems to have reset my 15g phenibut tolerance which is quite frankly to good to be true so i'll see how it develops the next couple of days.

Because I'm craving opioids and lots of Pregabalin, Venlafaxin, Diazepam, and some Mirtrazepine, makes me feel very good...  both Venlafaxine and Mirtazepine works on opiate receptors, the Pregabalin helps with neuropathic pain, which I do have; and the Diazepam helps protects me from having a seizure and also keeps me calm.

wait so you're telling me thats your daily med intake? why not just take a normal doese of venla like 225-300mg? do you have a doc who prescribes you all that stuff? have you even done an ECG? qt interval prolongation can be an issue here too. just imagine for a second you would have to come off 90mg diazepam and 650mg pregabalin at the same time while beeing on venlafaxine and mirtazapine. sounds like absolute hell to me.

No, my daily intake it's much less, but as I said, I'm craving opioids, and the closer I can feel to them is taking these amount of drugs. 

I have enough drugs to get off later. But really thanks for worrying.

The struggle is over. I'm almost 2 weeks Lyrica free. I will never take pregabalin again. Nothing positive at all came from this drug. No anxiety relief (even when I took it at steady/ sensible doses), just complete misery. I lost a good 6 months (at least) of my life and my mind because of it. 

For those who do find it beneficial, (it definitely helps so many) that's honestly great. Addictive personalities looking for anxiety relief can soon find themselves stuck in the Lyrica web.

thanks [@Xorkoth](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/77889/) 

I want to add, the fear of withdrawals or even PAWS is possibly why I just kept getting my fix. I'm happily surprised to note that I DIDN'T suffer through any and I kinda just took my last lot and decided to see what would unfold. I knew that I could easily get more if I suffered badly, but I was very lucky. So for anyone avoiding coming off of it for those reasons, I'm proof that it doesn't happen to everyone.

What you described feeling on Lyrica, I feel that way on Gabapentin......it makes me feel drunk (sans hangover), sloppy speech, and unsteady when I am walking about. Just took 300mg of Lyrica and I’m interested to see how I feel after an hour.

Shit, Gabapentin takes 90 min before I feel anything. Just got switched to Lyrica by my doc (nerve pain from surgery). Gabapentin makes me feel drunk as hell but does absolutely NOTHING for the neuropathy.

The reason I said four and 1/2 hours is because it takes around an hour or so, even an hour and 1/2 sometimes, the longest wait I've had with any medication, e.g. Focalin IR taken orally hits in a 1/2 hour, sometimes 45 minutes at the most with me.

Just used Lyrica to get me through the worst of my oxy withdrawal. It really helped a lot. I even had a break from benzos in that time too because pregabalin does their job pretty alright. Only real issues I had were all the damn side effects and the short half-life causing a lot of rebound anxiety unless I kept redosing. 


Stopped taking it now I'm past the worst of my oxy w/d, and started back on my clonazepam for anxiety.


Clonazepam is far superior for anxiety (fewer side effects, long acting, and no rebound) but pregabalin is an amazing comfort med for opiate withdrawals and I love it for that.


I tell you what though I'm gonna be with my girlfriend for a few nights and might bring some pregabalin... it really seems to increase libido and make things feel better too. Same as phenibut.

Pregabalin definitely has it's perks... sex drive is through the roof for example when on it (IME) and it stopped hangovers dead in their tracks. 

Possibly fun for very, very occasional use. Not for me anymore.. I've had my fill ![😉](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

I'm currently on Clonazepam now, but the dose is waaaay too low. Obviously doc started me on the lowest dose and I get maybe an hour's worth of panic free time.. I'm high end fucked up depression/ anxiety wise at this point in my life, I don't think anything can help me at this point.

Absolutely agreed that it's one for occasional use. I also find no recreation in it when taken alone. It's best in combos. Taking it with opiates for example feels great, although probably not too safe. It also does a good job of potentiating benzos.


But yeah awful drug to be on daily. The reason I have so much is because I have it leftover from an old script and it was awful. I just tapered myself off it even though my stupid psychiatrist wouldn't listen to me and kept trying to up my dose. He eventually gave me some diazepam instead but told me a million times how addictive it is. He gave me no such warnings about pregabalin for some reason...

I'm on 1.5mg clon per day. Ugh.

Absolutely agree with combining Pregabalin with benzos.. my perfect, magic combo was Lyrica/ Endone/Ritalin. Bliss.

Daily use of Pregabalin alone is nightmarish and zero fun.

My clonazepam script is up to 4mg per day. Never needed that much though in all honesty, 1mg is usually fine unless I have some especially bad anxiety. But when my anxiety is really bad alprazolam is the one for the job.

Yes alprazolam = Xanax. Very hard to get a script here in the UK but I just get it off the markets. I like the Ksalol 1mg pills, always reliable and hard hitting, and I tend to avoid pressed bars which tend to be inconsistent in quality unless they're the only thing I can get ahold of at the time.


I have actually had a Xanax script before from a private doctor but it was a short-term one-off. Only a proper croaker would hand out repeat scripts of it. It's not even an NHS approved drug so private docs are the only ones able to write a prescription.


Plenty on the black market though, it's become popular recently despite not being used in medicine here because of the hype in the US.

I'm in Australia and have had an array of meds presribed to me, but absolutely never Xanax. I've never even had the privilege to try it. I've had Ativan, Valium, clonazepam, Tamazepam, Seroquel, Pregabalin, Mirtazapine/Lexapro, Zoloft...

I once mentioned Xanax and the doctor looked at me like I was a fucking junkie and said nope. I've never sought any of these drugs for the high (although a bonus since who the fuck doesn't love the escape from chronic anxiety) but even still, Xanax is definitely frowned upon.

That makes sense based on what I know of Australia. Getting benzos in general is difficult as in the UK but because Xanax abuse was all over the media it got made a strongly controlled drug and got more stigma. Is that about right?


As for prices can't discuss those specifically here but I can say I just got 100x 1mg Xanax for less than a hundred quid. I have no idea about Australian prices though, I understand drugs in general are more expensive over there mostly due to your strict customs.

However, I admit that I tend to lean towards getting "something" out of benzos, I have a very addictive personality and I truly don't know how to be "ok" without feeling BETTER than ok, if that makes sense.

That's a good article, makes a lot of good points.


[This is a good one](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/wps.20219) too, from the World Psychiatry journal.


Basically benzos have been unfairly demonised and I think your article is right in that the pharma industry has a large part to play in that. All benzos are out of patent drugs and they wanna push new stuff, like pregabalin for example, even though pregabalin has more side effects and I would argue a harsher withdrawal when compared to benzodiazepines.


But I do also get what you're saying that the line between therapeutic and recreational use can be blurred. But then the same is true of pregabalin also.

 It certainly was blurred for me. I was at the point where just being outside of my norm was better than BEING. I didn't even enjoy the effects of Lyrica by itself, it was simply pure escapism, numbing and getting out of myself.

strange how Pregabalin affects people differently. I can take grams of the stuff and feel essentially nothing, although I'm going to try and potentiate it with some Xanax now. I wouldn't combine it with Opiates personally


Is Phenibut essentially a more 'natural' version of Pregabalin?

Natural is not the right word. Both of them are synthetic substances. IMO pregabalin is easier on the body and stronger. If you don't feel anything with grams of pregabalin I doubt you will get much out of phenibut. It is a very subtle drug, it works more as a mood enhancer than giving you a proper high. In any case drugs effects variability among different individuals can be huge.

Is it possible to experience withdrawal from Pregabalin and after taking a gram a day for 19 days ?. I got my first script 2 weeks ago , I got 120 75mg pills . I’ve never taken it before, I’ve tried gabapentin many times but never felt even the slightest anything from them even in heroic doses . I ask not cuz I’m going thru terrible withdrawals but I started waking up in a sweat the first day of not taking any and also the following two days . Also my sleep has bin disturbed since stopping . 

as some of you may know I am roughly 9 weeks post my last 100mg sublocade injection and I’m trying to figure out if maybe the bupe is finally leaving my system And I’m staying to feel it’s withdrawal .

A gram a day is a high dose, so withdrawal is possible. If I were you and had some pregabalin left I would do a quick tappering. Maybe, something like 500mg, 300, 200, 100, 75, 50, 25 and off. Quick tapperings work for me when I have used high doses for a short time. You won't get rid completely of withdrawal but It will become easier to live with.

I don't know about the bupe so I don't comment. But I have been in the situation of abusing several drugs and not knowing where my withdrawal was coming from...

I find that phenibut is far and away the best sex enhancer ofmit, gabapentin and lyrica.  It's similar to GHB sex vibes, but less intense and bestial.  Gabapentin and Lyrica are alright too but phenibut it one of the best sex drugs ever.

To me pregabalin is like a more "fucked up" version of phenibut. While phenibut makes me feel stimulated and anxiety-free all day, pregabalin has a short duration and fucks me up while reducing anxiety. The physical sensations of the drugs are very similar.


Pregabalin and phenibut are very similar chemically, with only one chemical alteration from pregabalin to phenibut IIRC.


Gabapentinoids as a drug class seem to be like that though - differ very differently between individuals, where some like me get strong effects, others don't get anything at all, others just fall asleep, etc.


I'm curious what's your tolerance to benzos and other GABAergics though? I know pregabalin isn't actually one itself but I am sure its calcium channel blocker action does something or other to the flow of GABA in brain and there will be some new study showing as such in the future. Even Pfizer doesn't still fully even understand how the stuff works.

Agreed 100% phenibut is the fucking ultimate, but the last batch of phenibut I got after my last source disappeared is low quality and I have a load of pregabs left over from an old script. Does the job well. Mixed it with Xanax after too and fucked me up nice.

that might be because pregabalin is Much much stronger than Phenibut even though like you say are very similar, this is mostly based on the Bioavailability of the drug, it should be respected because it does have noticable effects but the negative is that tolerance builds extremely fast if used in higher doses.

Phenibutt is only partly a gabapentinoid.  Pregabalin and gabapentin both entirely work by interacting with voltage-dependent calcium channels.  Phenibut does, too, but in addition to that, it is a gaba-B agonist, like GHB.  So it has 2 mnechanisms of action and has similar but distinct effects from pregabalin and gabapentin.


Personally if I could pick 3 drugs to be able to use for the rest  of my life when I wanted to, and not be able to use all other drugs, phenibut would probably be on that list.  I can't say that for pregabalin or gabapentin, though I really like both of them too.  Phenibut is my favorite by far though.

I can't get phenibut to work properly, imo it stinks? Effects are far too subtle for me to compare it to something like ghb, which is amazing, I miss it, I shouldn't even be talking about it. Pregabalin and gabapentin give me a weird headspace, but gabapentin over pregabalin anyday. If I want to feel an additional stoning effect I'll grab the carisoprodols instead of those two, far comfier.

Yeah Soma is nice, but different.  Phenibut is hard to dose right and I think it just doesn't do it for some people but for me, the proper dose is extremely euphoric.  I don't feel intoxicated, I feel stimulated and fearless and like I can do everything better.  It lasts for over 24 hours, too.

But what's really interesting is the study showing this dual action of phenibut is very recent even though phenibut has existed for decades and is used medically in Russia and surrounding countries.


Which does somewhat bolster my point when it comes to pregabalin, despite the fact it has now been an approved pharmaceutical since 2002 I believe, we still have very little idea how it works aside from the knowledge it's a calcium channel blocker. 


I've been scripted so many bloody psych meds over the years and the number of times I read the patient information leaflet and there's something saying "We don't fully understand how this drug works but..." before giving a vague description of the receptors it hits is madness to me. Mirtazapine I believe was another. They know it hits a load of receptors but they have no clue how it's meant to actually help depression. And that's an old generic drug.


This is also why it drives me crazy when people arguing against medical cannabis say things like "but we don't know what it does to your brain!" The same is true for just so many FDA and NICE approved pharmaceuticals you wouldn't believe. At least cannabis has thousands of years of human use. Pregabalin didn't exist until a few decades ago.


Anyway rant aside, I agree with you about phenibut vs. the other gabapentinoids. Phenibut is the superior drug in terms of subjective effects and I'd absolutely choose it over pregabalin if given the choice. I just happen to have a load of pregabalin on hand from my old script and no reliable new source for phenibut. That pregabalin is so old actually it went "out of date" in 2017 but as we know that means nothing and is yet another ridiculous scam from the pharma industry. It's the Lyrica brand name though. Then again I also got given some free Sandoz generic pregabalin chucked in with some benzos and it's just as good.

I know pregabalin isn't actually one itself but I am sure its calcium channel blocker action does something or other to the flow of GABA in brain and there will be some new study showing as such in the future. Even Pfizer doesn't still fully even understand how the stuff works.

When I have no tolerance at all, 1.5g does it for me, divided into 2 or 3 doses (seems to work better that way, and smoother).  These days I do it once a week or less, and I do 2-2.5g, it depends on the day.  I have a friend who has to stop at 500mg though, or he gets fucked up.  Too much phenibut is not fun.

1.5g is the sweet spot for me with phenibut. But unlike [@Xorkoth](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/77889/) I take that all at once. I've found phenibut to be most effective when the whole dose is taken either early in the morning or before I sleep the previous night. When I do the latter I wake up feeling it instantly and it still manages to last all day to boot. Magical stuff for me.


I always kept it to once a week since phenibut tolerance comes on so quick so never really needed to use higher doses. I did experiment at 2g which started to impair me, then 2.5-3g which just had me smashed but not necessarily in a fun way. For me the magic of phenibut is that it keeps you clearheaded so I stick to 1.5g generally.


Also mixed benzos with it before, which again has me mashed, but it ruins the stimulating feeling from the phenibut for me so I don't tend to like it. Bit of a waste of phenibut, would rather take the benzos on their own.


Something I'm yet to try, surprisingly, is my amphetamine script mixed with phenibut. In theory that should be a pretty nice combo. I'll give it a whirl next time I get my hands on some quality stuff.

Yeah, the reason phenibut is the best of them is because it's 100% functional, it's almost like super-sobriety.  When dosed right.  It's also like 10 times better for sex than Lyrica or gabapentin.  And it produces the most reliable and clear-minded confidence of any drug I've done.  Gabapentin is good too, but gets me feeling kinda wonky.  And Lyrica is really pleasurable but it fucks me up, I get really intoxicated.


Phenibut works really, really well with stims, smoothing them out and increasing the euphoria.  It also works really, really well with psychedelics, it doesn't reduce the sttrength of the trip at all, but it does make all the transitions easier and emphasizes the euphoric/positive aspects.

I'm currently taking 2 x Lyrica 225 mg a day for anxiety. Sometimes I feel particularly anxious - would it do any good to take e.g. 900 mg at once in these kind of situations?

In MY experience.. Lyrica is a horrid, life sucking drug. I'll only speak of my personal experience here:

It's FAKE. The results from taking this medication are so brain fucking that you actually believe it's working. 

You'll go from a safe and stable dose to extremely high and unattainable dosages. 

You will lose yourself. 

You will lose time. 

You will ride a path that leads to nowhere VERY quickly as your tolerance builds to unachievable levels. 

Quoting my doctor "Lyrica came out with bells and whistles but it's absolutely useless".


Be careful.

Sounds like a bad idea because you'll mess up with your tolerance and then it won't work as it should. Tolerance to pregabalin skyrockets very easily. You should talk to your psychiatrist and try to get a benzo for ocasional use. But just once in a while, you don't want to be taking too many benzos.

I know now your situation is hard because of the anxiety, but if you overdo medication you'll have anxiety and a drug problem.

Try breathing tecniques as well to see if they help.

Hey Survival, I was prescribed 600mg Lyrica per day for ~5 years (either 2 x 300 or 3 x 200mg) for a treatment-resistant somatic anxiety disorder. This was in addition to either 30mg diazepam or 2mg clonazepam per day. High dose Lyrica worked well for my anxiety....for about 2 months, and the subsequent years I took 600mg simply to prevent withdrawal.


I highly suggest not to raise your dose to 900mg even occasionally. In my experience doing so might blunt the anxiety once or twice but your tolerance will adjust absurdly quickly and you will only be in a worse state in between doses. 


If you are only taking this medication for anxiety (as I was) and not for pain, I'd suggest starting to discuss a plan with your doctor to slowly wean off of it. I regrettably have experience with many types of withdrawal, and as unbelievable as this may sound, I found acute Lyrica withdrawal to be more debilitating than acute benzodiazepine withdrawal. 


**Don't get me wrong:** I would rather have to withdraw from Lyrica 10 more times than to repeat the 2 years it took me to fully heal from benzodiazepine withdrawal. 


In my experience the acute withdrawal from 7 years of daily prescribed benzos were a very long, drawn out, cyclical slog. It was 6 months before I felt capable again, another 12 months before I felt mostly back to "normal", and finally 6 more months before I could reliably get a full night's sleep without a handful of clonidine/hydroxyzine. It was a period of hardship to say the least, but it was mostly a mental fight and was rarely completely overwhelming at any one moment. 


In comparison, Lyrica withdrawal 'only' took a couple months of a steady taper to free myself and did not have the persistent, nearly unending residual post-acute symptoms that benzos did. Once I had lowered my dose to between 50-75mg/day I was able to jump off with relative ease and never look back. HOWEVER, when I was still on 600mg, if I had to go anymore than 24 hours MAX between doses I was thrown under an unholy freight train of acute W/D that I can only describe as a combination of high dose opiate+benzo withdrawal with additional effects unique only to Lyrica. I could set a clock by it, and it was fucking bad. Not only would I get the restlessness/anxiety/severe depression/nausea/sensory overload of opiates & benzo wd, but also pronounced dissociation of watching these things in 3rd person like watching a car wreck in slow motion while my limbs would literally swell up with fluid and I could barely walk. I do not have any medical conditions that would otherwise put me at risk of dissociation or fluid retention. These only ever happened when stopping high dose Lyrica. 


These symptoms were so debilitating that during a brief insurance gap, I actually voluntarily paid for my month supply of Lyrica out of pocket on 2 or 3 occasions. That's over $700 for a 30 day supply. And believe me when I say that I couldn't get to the pharmacy fast enough. My saint of a neighbor drove me the 1/2 mile too, because there's no way I could have physically drove or walked myself. I would not even consider such an act of desperation during a bad morphine withdrawal. ***And all of this was when I still had valium. It didn't help.***


My point is not to scare you, only to plead with you not to put yourself in a situation where you might run out of a high dose daily Lyrica prescription. Even most doctors that prescribe Lyrica do not realize that it has severe withdrawal symptoms. Most of their patients who do take pregabalin are taking under 300mg per day. I do not know if it is this bad for everyone, but it humbled me and made me realize that I needed to finally get off of it. It was a bad choice as a long-term anxiety medication.

I am down to 50mg per day of Lyrica and my teeth fucking hurt like I have 50 cavities. I cant tell if its because of long term use or if the pain is just more noticeable at such a low dose but I cannot wait to be off this crap.

I would still say it’s fun recreationally, even though the chemical hangover lasts a whole day for me, but I hope to be off it soon. I’m really worried I’m going to lose some teeth over this one.

Even most doctors that prescribe Lyrica do not realize that it has severe withdrawal symptoms. Most of their patients who do take pregabalin are taking under 300mg per day. I do not know if it is this bad for everyone, but it humbled me and made me realize that I needed to finally get off of it. It was a bad choice as a long-term anxiety medication.

> 			I've been a long time admirer of pregabalin since my discovery of it 3-4 years ago. Lyrica and all its incredibly cheap generic versions are OTC at any pharmacy nation-wide here in Egypt.I started to experiment with it extensively and found out a few things time after time. First of all, always gotta be careful with dosing because for me, it used to cause some myoclonic jerks that can get violent whenever I take 1.5 grams in a single dose with a clean body. Another thing is, Pregabalin is one HELL of a mixing drug. I've tried it with every substance I've had access to and it really is beautiful. smoking weed while approaching the peak can be an almost psychedelic, extremely euphoric experience. It's just great with everything from DXM and weed to opiates as it not only adds to the experience but it alters it to make up a relatively new one. Lyrica is also great when respected because if you take a single high dose occasionally it won't hook you and you'll have long years of beautiful occasional weekends with it. A simple but annoying thing too is that when you take a high dose (all my doses are on a total clean tolerance and empty stomach and are upwards of 900mg) and you get very sleepy but don't wanna let it go just yet, you'll enter a state of hypnagogia where, if someone were to wake you up because you're passed out sitting up in front of your laptop for example, you'll be unconscious but responsive and are very likely to act like a hallucinating idiot. I'm sure there's other things that I don't recall at the moment but overall, Lyrica is a beautiful drug with a huge recreational potential because it's very safe relative to most recreational substances, not addictive unless you got deep issues and just want whatever pill to numb you a bit, very very euphoric and even more if used in the right setting, very empathic and lowers your inhibitions whilst stimulating you too all at the same time.

> I would say 300mg would be a good starting dose for someone not tolerant to GABAergics. Also, this isn't an anti-depressant, you don't need to wait a long period of time to feel its effects. We're talking about recreational drugs, lyrica takes a long time to kick in and that is 1-1.5hours oral. I have a mild GABA tolerance and find 900-1200mg a good dose but have taken 2400mg before and had fun so I wouldn't say you are at risk of ODing and having a bad time. In any case you sound like you would really benefit from some drug/lyrica education so read the lyrica/pregabalin megathread and whatever you can on here. The only real negative side effect I have experienced when you are at the 1000mg plus range is joint pain.

> I would think 450 would be recreational for someone like you with 300 being conservative but hey if 300 or 225 (I gather you have 75mg tabs) even works for you then great. The problem with starting low is that the half life is 5-6 hours and it takes a while to kick in so by the time you wait and don't feel much then wait for it to kick in your system has eliminated a decent amount, so start somewhere reasonable. Definitely don't start below 200 and feel free to go up to 600.

Slight topic hi jack here but what is the conversion between gabapentin and pregabalin. From my research it is as follows


- Gabapentin 901 mg/day to 1500 mg/day → pregabalin 225 mg/day
- Gabapentin 1501 mg/day 2100 mg/day → pregabalin 300 mg/day
- Gabapentin 2101 mg/day 2700 mg/day → pregabalin 450 mg/day
- Gabapentin >2700 mg/day → pregabalin 600 mg/day
Are these conversions right?


Sorry for hijack

Start with 75mg and see how you feel. I’d say 150mg would be more than enough.

Yes, I will try 75 mg. next time.

In the past, I liked the mix pregabalin/tramadol but yesterday it didn't feel right.

PS. The pregabalin I took is from an Indian lab, I don't think that matters or does it?

Shouldn’t matter as long as it’s legit.


I mentioned in the other thread that the tramadol will have influenced the effect but please don’t be taking doses that high of tramadol. You’re really pushing it with those doses. 800mg is a lot even with pregabalin.

New here, I was just prescribed 50mg 3x/day to help with my social anxiety.  Previously I was on Gabapentin and was up to 2400 mg/day.  Last time I took gabapentin was back in January of this year.


How long does pregabalin usually take for me to feel the effects the first time I take it?  A week, a few hours etc.  I want to go about this safely.

Prolly ~30-45 mins. It will continue to build for an hour or two so wait a couple hours at least before dosing more, IMO/E.

I'm prescribed 450mg a day for pain, it's quite effective and I'm enjoying the buzz from it more and more, especially if I take the whole daily dose at once. Combined with good weed it's quite the body high.

Pregabalin is one of the favs to be quite frank; clear headed alcohol with some hallucinations but not as euphoric as GHB ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)

Hi,


I’m fairly new here, and just want to share my experience with Lyrica. I used to smoke a lot of weed and snorted ketamine. But my stock ran out during this lockdown, so I’m left with a few meds that my mom wanted to throw out. One of them is Lyrica. I have never taken drug meds like this before I guess my tolerance is 0.  After reading this megathread from page 1 (yeah I really did took me a day), I decided to give it a try @ 600mg (50mg pills) at 9pm.


Waiited for an hour and a half, nothing. Then I popped another 600mg and thats where I feel the tingling sensation and ‘floaty’ if you get what I mean. The buzz wasn’t as high as I would expect, another hour passed by I started to feel dumbed down like staring at my ipad didn’t scroll or whatever for a solid 10 mins. When I rose up that’s where I feel very floaty and I couldn’t find my balance, walking to the toilet like I was drunk. The euphoric feeling was mild and I was hoping I could see visions like what was told in this forum.


I spent my time listening to music with lights off and I felt so much vibe, slept around 2am. I woke up at 3pm (never happened before, usually wakes up at 8-9am) and I do still feel a bit ’floaty’ until now as I am typing this @ 8pm.


Overall this drug was quite okay considering I have nothing left in my stock. Definitely going to try a larger dose next week as I’m letting myself do this once a week because the tolerance build up is quite fast so I’ve heard in this megathread.

The thing will Lyrica for me was I able to drink shitloads and never felt drunk. The thing with my friends and I while using it was that we could go all night on the booze, not get wasted and take more the next day to stop the hangover in it's tracks. Definitely agree on the 12 hour high and the fact it takes approx 2 hours to kick in. 

I was one of the unfortunate ones who became extremely addicted for around 6 months; daily use. I was getting it prescribed readily for anxiety but it ended up completely fucking up my life. 

Taken sparingly is something I'd highly advise. 

The high was very strange and honestly not fun. It was a means of escapism for me.. it altered my perception and feelings but was never what I'd call enjoyable.

I was taking over a gram a day towards the end..

I really rare lyrics in doses of 600-900mg, and if taken the the evening it lasts well imto.the next day. It does duck up your balance though.and makes you appear inebriated way more than bemzos. Don't take at work or driving!

What would people recommend a first time user take to deal with just every day anxiety i can get it cheap on the street and save myself a $500 + visit to a psychiatrist to get a prescription if they will even give me. 


Was looking for something less abusive than xannax

I would start very low and see how it goes. Maybe as low as 25 or 50mg twice or thrice a day. If that doesn't work, up it to 75-150 and no more. And if you are using it for anxiety don't mess with it. High doses will get you really tolerant very quickly.


You can abuse pregabalin, definitely preferable to benzos but some people get bad withdrawals from it. Other people like me didn't get bad ones, but getting worse and worse every time I get it. If you need it for anxiety try not to ruin it. If you abuse it would probably be useless for that.

Does pregabalin dull or stop mdma, acid and shrooms etc from working like antidepressants and anxiety meds do? 


I tried pregabalin once but had some side effects after 10 days so stopped, but that could of been other stuff I took around that time too making the side effects worse, my doctor mentioned it for fibromyalgia but as I have anxiety too it seems a good idea to try it again as it might help both, she's calling back in 10 days as I need to try and stop mirtazapine using zopiclone as she don't want me on to many meds at once

No, it doesn't dull psychedelics. Quite a nice mix as it deals with the anxiety they might produce. No experience with pregabalin and mdma. I imagine in the come up of mdma might potentiate each other, may be uncomfortable depending the kind of come ups you have from mdma, doubt it will be dangerous at reasonable dosages.

Lyrica and Gabapentin is about the only meds that work for nerve pain. There are not much they can do for nerve pain. I have MS I know nerve pain. The only thing that I found that helped me was wine or pot and pot is illegal here unless you can get medical marijuana card which I’m in the process of. I just want to sleep with out having to drink two bottles of wine and two amitriptyline.

Sorry if this has been addressed elsewhere in the mega-thread, but can someone explain to a newbie whether or not pregabalin has any effect on GABA receptors?


According to the PsychonautWiki:


"Although pregabalin is a chemical derivative of [GABA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GABA), it displays no activity at any GABA receptors, including GABAA, GABAB and the [benzodiazepine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine) site. Pregabalin, despite its GABA backbone, does not appear to alter GABA levels in the brain, so its pharmacological activity is presumed to be unrelated to GABA."


However, this thread seems to be full of people talking about cross-tolerance with benzos and other GABAergics. I'd be grateful for any clarification/education.

As you see the last studies are against any gaba activity. In my experience withdrawing from pregabalin (without any statistic value), I found alcohol or benzos to interfere in the recovery, so I don't know really. I wouldn't say they are cross-tolerant, but I think pregabalin might affect the gabaergic system at least in some indirect way. Sometimes happens than a totally different neurotransmitter can affect the function of others. Truth is the pregabalin mechanism of action is still very poorly understood and we should wait for more studies.

^ Thanks. I'm mainly interested from a harm reduction standpoint i.e. could combining benzos with a high dose of pregabalin be dangerous? But it would be nice to know about cross-tolerance, too.

I took 1200 mg yesterday at 8 in the morning, (barely felt it)

 can I take like 1500 or 2000 mg today and still feel something? I know you should wait atleast a day inbetween but my anxiety is through the roof can't barely make myself go to the kitchen (i have already taken 2.5 mg xanax and 500 ml of 7% beer that isnt working but maybe it can work to boost the lyrica?)

If you take it at those doses following 1200mg which didn't get you there yesterday it probably won't get you high, but if you're suffering anxiety because of an addiction to it it should take care of those symptoms

I doubt very much it would be dangerous as both substances have a extremely high margin of security (difference between active dose and LD50). Potentiation is very likely so don't go overboard. In my case that mix is out of question because it would produce high somnolence without a doubt.

I tried pregabalin having drunk before and couldn't feel it much at usual doses. Very weird, was just a one time thing. After that I made sure I didn't drink before pregabalin.

Can confirm that diazepam significantly potentiates pregabalin. Yesterday I had 750mg Lyrica and popped 10mg diazepam about seven hours later, and it completely re-invigorated the pregabalin effects.

Pregabalin at 75mg is definitely noticeable. I'm not even joking.


I don't know where anyone gets 300mg as a starting dose. That's like 2g phenibut as a starting recreational dose where 500mg is more appropriate.

I suppose yes if your nieve to the medication you would feel 75mg but 300mg will probably get you smashed for most of the day, it's like saying take a quarter of an E and see how that is. 


The number of times when I was younger I would just drop a pill into a stranger's mouth at a rave thinking that motherfucker will be flying all night. We didn't think about it from a harm reduction perspective because we were drug people and that isn't how we thought, it was just a goal to get people as fucked up and high as possible, I introduced my younger brother to liberty caps one autumn when he was 10, I was 16 we were out exercising our family dog in the a place called the yellow hills where I used to go with my friends to pick shrooms every year, I had been introduced to them when I was about 12 it's kind of a right of passage thing where I'm from that we learn amazing psychedelic substances just grow in cow fields where we live. We got high as fuck that day and he says it was one of the greatest days he remembers and I agree. I thought at the time, I need to introduce him to this shit so I need to give him enough that he has a proper trip. ![😂](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f602.png)He survived. 


Another time we had driven about 3 hours to this rave and the sun had come up, the DJ had switched to playing reggae so that was our cue to chip. As we staggered towards where we had parked in some other field I saw an old friend I hadn't seen in years and turned out one of the friends I was with also knew this guy, we chatted for a couple of minutes then he says to my friend I arrived with "hey man stick out your tongue" which he instantly did without thinking and he droppered him, I said "hey bruv what was that?" He says "liquid sunshine" (acid) with a massive beaming grin on his face I said "oh fuck he's our fucking driver!" I had taken some whizz (base amphet) a couple of pills and some mdma powder which I had dosed by just sticking a rolled up 20 into a bag of powdered Crystal and snorting till the pain hit my nostril so I was still smashed, my girlfriend was rolling on some pills we had all been dancing all night so we were screwed. He was so distraught he says "oh fuck it, I'm so sorry mate I didn't even think." So we did the only thing we could do, he dosed me and we set off home asap to see if we could make it. After an hour we pulled into the hard shoulder on the motorway and I looked at my friend and was like ".....oh fuck we are not in a boat are we?" Because for the past who knows how long I thought we were in a boat powering up a river coasting on the water. My gf pops up from the back seat and says "no but I think we have been weaving for a while." We decided to limp to the service station and plot up there mainlining coffee til we could get home. Anyway I have gone off a bit but what I'm saying is that sometimes as drug people we are like hey man neck this pill it's awesome (I often hand out a few 300mg to some of my friends who like a buzz and we get smashed and it's blinding) but I suppose here it's about helping people to do whatever they are gonna do as safely as possible as a Dr would titrate you up on a medication til it's effective or identified as not working for you. However we often forget and think yeah drop 300mg it won't harm you but you will know all about the effects and whether it's for you. I guess occasionally we need 

reminding. ![😁](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f601.png)

Does anyone else feel weird when mixing tramadol and pregabalin? It's like you're about to seizuring I thought that pregabalin would raise the seizure threshold of tramadol but not apparently.

How much do you use, may i ask? When i take 200mg tramadol i take 150mg pregabalin, never an issue but this is low. I know that if i take say 900mg pregabalin i get that feeling by itself a  bit already. .. or even 450 taken at once for that matter

Cross tolerance with what?


My doctor started me on 75mg/day for anxiety, but that is considered a low/moderate dose.

It is believed that gabapentinoids including pregabalin (Lyrica) have a different mechanism of action to benzodiazepines (incl. alprazolam) so logically there shouldn't be any cross tolerance. But gabapentinoids are still not fully understood. 


Also, mixing gabapentinoids and benzos will potentiate the effects of both.

But as everyone here has noted, tolerance came on quickly and the effects are quite variable from person to person. I have, on several occasions, taken doses I wouldn't feel now and been scarily screwed up, twitching and all. But that doesn't happen anymore, and I can take 3g of it and feel less good than if I take 500mg. I don't know why this is.

I did 1800mg of pregabalin and 500mg tramadol (i am heavyweight and i had high tramadol tolerance so 500mg of tramadol wasn't that much for me) within 8 hours and i felt great. If you don' t have predisposition then you will be OK. 


Back in days  everybody did one bottle top full of sirup so 6ml=600ml at once (low tolerance users and even first time users) a nobody ever had seizure. We didn't even know it's possible until somebody did 4 bottle tops and almost died during seizure.

Holy shit! Four bottles are like 4 grams. Where I live, tramadol comes as an oral solution as drops (each bottle has 1 or 2 grams). The most I have taken is 1.5 grams. No seizures, just ended up nodding a lot.

I don't know what happened that day. It made me feel so weird, because even with very high doses of just tramadol it does not cause those tremors and nervousness.

4x600=2400 and bottles were 100mls and 96mls (wtf ?) with 100mg per ml and only 20-30 € for bottle. Most i did was 1000mg and twice. First time i used different lid, enjoyed it lot because it was Friday night in town center but it was too much because i nodded off in a pub while sitting and went to deep sleep straight away and woke up because one of the friends started shouting at me and friends and few random people were laughing because i was snorring really loud heavily (btw i don't even snore normally, only on opiates). Second time it was 12 ml syringe and i had small sip and i expected 4ml gone, but it was 10ml. When i was doing it only 4-5 times a year this way that buzz was crazy. But i don't think i will ever touch again

What is the therapeutic dose? 

I was prescribed Pregabalin for a back injury a while back. Never took it. I'm thinking of taking it now for instant anxiety relief due to a traumatic event that has just happened.

I love pregabalin, it's easily in my top 5. The way it eliminates anxiety, provides euphoria, and sometimes produces gnarly hallucinations is all great. Plus I find it makes music sound more "full". 


If I take it on its own, I like around 200-250mg. I find that produces a nice mood boost, evens me off, and helps me stay upbeat throughout the day due to no anxiety. I can also manage stressful situations better (though it doesn't stop me from getting stressed out).


It combines with pretty much everything that I take, though, and makes it better, which is perhaps the biggest appeal. One of my best LSD trips was with 200mg of pregabalin. The experience was incredible and therapeutic, I fully felt the acid but it was warmer and more encompassing than I remembered from my previous trips.


It also goes amazing with stimulants. I usually take higher doses for this combo, usually 500-700mg. I had an insanely euphoric experience with 3-MMC, a 5mg 1:1 THC:CBD edible, and pregabalin. I've never, ever felt like that and it lasted for hours. So good.


I'm grateful that I've never experienced any withdrawal from it, but I also only take it intermittently so maybe that has something to do with it.

Yeah. It's great with stims. Once i did 900mg in morning and i was snorting 500mg of dextroamphetamine (powder) until the evening. I felt so happy, outgoing and excited few times before with other combos, but that day it was with zero negative side effects, so i really enjoyed that

Yes, I was afraid of that. Although today I had planned to use it for my anxiety, because I dont have benzos.

I would say it's really not worth it taking it two days in a row. I can take up to triple the amout from the first day and only feel a slight buzz. My gaba receptors are fucked though but I remember even the first time I took it, 150 mg, took 750 mg the next day and felt almost nothing at all.


Just wait a day inbetween it's much better

Does anybody know of any research chemicals new or old that are similar to pregabalin/gabapentin or is there something else like phenibut I can take to get somewhat of the same feeling?

Yeah. Also I believe that I acquired a chronic tolerance to pregabalin (despite only take it for a few weeks last year). I can't get high anymore. Doses of over 750mg now just make me feel sick and sleepy.

That's interesting was it pharmacy pregabalin you took? And did you take it every day or did you have clean days inbetween?

I used to take this fake internet pregabalin, took 1.5 - 2.0 grams every other day, on day off one day on, for half a year. I also noticed at the end of my uing, when I got pharmacy preg, that the internet pregabalin was waaay stronger..

I was clean off it for maybe 1,5 years, and now I have to take +900mg to even feel something. I get this wierd "skin pain" also, every time I take it now and that's super wierd. It's like the outer 0.5 cm of my scin aches. I can get high on those doses though, but mostly I take 1200 mg. Mixing with weed helps as well.


Do you have a chronic benso tolerance bc of your pregabalin use as well?

First time i had box of Pregabalin, i took it everyday since first day. I went from 600mg to 1800mg within week. Most i did was 2400mg and it's completely different experience than 600mg even with zero tolerance. 


Btw. I received a box 30 minutes ago. 90x300mg ![😻](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f63b.png)

Yeah It was pregabalin bought in pharmacies. Although I noticed that there was a difference between brands, some brands hit me more than others. I took it for about three weeks every day. And sporadically for another month. In the end I no longer felt anything, just a waste of money and pills.

One of my favorite combos was pregabalin / tramadol, now I don't feel shit, just the tramadol. 

Apparently I don't create tolerance to benzos. I have taken clonazepam and clotiazepam and they work fine. Although I have not used them recreationally, just for their anticonvulsant effect and to sleep a couple of times.

How do you guys keep taking pregabalin for so long and still feel high?

I use it every day for about a year now, for sleeping .. about 450 per day. If i take 300 in the afternoon i do feel a subtle relaxation.

Same here. Pregablin & Tramadol were awesome until the pregablin tolerance kicked in, which was incredibly fast. Pregablin has a generic option now in the USA....I wonder what the differences are. My Pain Mgmt doc is awesome & has an open script, to a certain degree. Pregab is a controlled substance here. I went back to staggering gabapentin with tramadol, since gabapentin is so easy to obtain (though my pain Doc says that gabbies will be a controlled substance soon).

Anyway, Pregablin does do wonders for nerve pain & mood, at least for me. Everyone reacts differently to meds.

Nowadays mixing tramadol and pregabalin just makes me feel weird and kill my tramadol high. In addition, it cause me some scary tremors and twitching that seem to be like the beginning of a seizure or something like that.

Doesn't this happen to you?

Actually it works better after few days, because negative side effects like dizziness disappear, but positive effects are same and that allows you to go higher with daily dosage.

Just wait at least 2 hours and if you feel good, then you can do another pill

Yeah and when you mix it with tramadol is fuckin scary. I always thought pregabalin and tramadol was a safe mix but apparently that's true only if you take low to moderate doses.

I know pregabalin isn't actually one itself but I am sure its calcium channel blocker action does something or other to the flow of GABA in brain and there will be some new study showing as such in the future. Even Pfizer doesn't still fully even understand how the stuff works.

In my experience and from what I have read, there is no cross tolerance between benzos and pregabalin. But, I have a very low tolerance to benzos so ... 

2 mg. clonazepam still blackouts me regardless of my tolerance to pregabalin.

I’ve been on lyrica for years (I have major back issues, including radiculopathy and neuropathy in both of my legs, I have narrow spinal stenosis as well as a deteriorating T12 - L1 vertebrae and I just had surgery on my lumbar. it was actually a lumbar revision that they did on me. I was in the OR for 6 to 7 hours. I’m still having issues and pain from the three displaced nerves that were brought back into place as well as a bunch of nerves that were ribboned right by by my broken S1 and fractured L5 vertebrae. I’m still recovering from the surgery. The recovery time was supposed to be 10-12 weeks but because of a fee setbacks it’ more like 15 weeks I guess).


I was originally prescribed 75 mg capsules two times a day. Once my tolerance kicked in from the 75 mg 3x a day I was upped to 150 twice a day.


So I would say for a first time user take 75 mg capsule and wait an hour and then take another 75 mg capsule, drink it with Ginger ale or Sprite or something carbonated that’s clear and eat a light meal or snack in between.


I took my first 150 capsule and I was feeling some thing, I wouldn’t say it was a high. It was more of like Being really dizzy, it actually kicked in when I was driving but luckily I was really close to my Destiination. After that I realized how it could be use recreationally. I used to be able to take my whole script within a week of the 150s 2 times a day and not feel any with drawl. However once my PCP up to me to 150s three times a day I noticed that when I would take my script in a week or 2, I would withdraw and It was awful.


so pretty much now what I do is I take 150 once or twice a day and I save the rest of them. For a rainy day or day where I want to just relax a bit. That with the combination of my alprazolam is great. It’s also a good way to come down from any upper like Coke/crack/freebase cocaine.


also it helps tremendously with opiate withdrawal’s, not so much the fentanyl or the fetidope, or at least I haven’t figured the right timing for it.

I’ve been taking alprazolam way longer than I have been taking pregablin. I have not noticed any type of cross tolerance. I’ve been on pregablin going on 3 years and alprazolam probably about 8 years. Unfortunately in my state I am maxed out on the dose of alprazolam I can take due to state, medical, and insurance restrictions

Pregabalin made me act so out of character I can't even believe how much it changed me, I was on it a month or two it's fucking dangerous


Now I ache all over as I have fibromyalgia, so maybe it started to help my aches and stiffness but I'm off it now as heared the withdrawal is bad so stopped before I got more addicted to it and the fact i needed to go up and up and up on the dose to be able to sleep, then I ate 14 and drank, bad mistake! 


I told my doctor to put me back on mirtazapine I wrote about that on another thread here can't remember shit about fuck, sorry if I mentioned it on here before lol, but people go carefull on pregabalin

Guys

I've never snorted pregabalin before and it definitely works. It's faster but may not have as high bioability as oral ROA.

300mg and I feel now very relaxed and mellow.

I know it sounds counterintuitive with oral ROA having a 90% bioavailability, but with a 3 hour come up time orally, snorting definitely brings it on much more quickly, however, I find that it cuts down the duration and intensity of the hit which makes it not worth it, imo.

Yes, but sometimes I like the duration to be shorter. The effect of pregabalin is too long and I almost always feel it the day after taking it.

The intensity seems good to me and at least it has not caused me tremors when mixed with tramadol. This dose taken orally always causes me to tremble and twitch.

What was surprising is that it doesn't hurt like other pills.

Stay fucking off it, the withdrawal off this is bad, I feel like I can't cope with a dam thing right now, I think it's even worse than benzo withdrawal and I wasn't even on pregabalin very long at all, couple of months if that not even a high dose either, I heard the anxiety and depression is bad when you stop, so it's also why I stopped before I got to addicted 


I didn't even think it was helping my anxiety, it was helping my sleep to start with till my tolerance went up wihin a week, then bang, you stop and fuck you're not prepared for tears and anxiety and fucking depression that will be facing you when you actually decide to stop


This fucking shit is evil, it's messed me up bad, good fucking luck to anyone coming off this, you're going to need it


And those using it for fun, you don't know what awaits you I'm warning you now, stop before it gets its hooks into you even more than it already has

That is why I take pregabalin sporadically and benzos not to mention. I have a lot of respect for benzos.

Pregabalin helped me with my anxiety only for the first few days. When I gain a bit of tolerance (only after a few days) it stops working for my anxiety.

[@supersonic89](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/525648/) I was addicted to benzos for years, quit May last year then not to long ago bought some benzos to come off Mirtazapine (that I'd used to come off benzos as had paws) then went on Pregabalin off doctor (for anxiety and fibromyalgia) but I also used them to come off the benzos as I l'd only took them for a month or so, now I have nothing left to try for anxiety and sleep so been waiting on, yep my benzos to arrive, if they don't come today I'm not sure I'm going to cope, most likely ketamine if I can get it, apparently my dealer who stopped selling it has started again that's a possible option lol

You don't know how I understand you man.  It's the worst when one day you run out of your drug of choice.

Does your dealer even have xanax? What benzo were you addicted to?

Have you finished the pregabalin taper? Maybe 150mg-300mg of pregabalin today wouldn't be so bad.

Nope she has K, that's it, that's even if she's not sold out, I'm addicted to any benzo, I was addicted to valium up till last year, but recently I've been choosing different ones as had found somewhere to get nitrazapam and clonazepam, I've only bought the nitrazapam once as didn't like it, probably because it was fake, and I bought the clonazepam twice, but the last lot was alot weaker than the first lot


This time I ordered xanax but they haven't shown up, which is weird as he's not let me down before it's who I used to buy off when I was addicted before, I've only ever had one lot of valium go missing before a long time ago and off another online seller who actually replaced them, but I've lost his contacts


I gave all my pregabalin away as wanted off I didn't taper I went down from 5 or 6 x 75mg a night to just one night of mirtazapine, then over the counter sleeping tablets called Promethazine and a herb Valerian but I can't use them again they're shit, definitely not taking the Valerian as the nightmares are to horrible


So I've nothing, not even my 10 zopiclone I get off my doctor a month that should of came through to the pharmacy so I'm on hold to the doctors now to find out why


And nope, no xanax has turned up and my postman has normally arrived by now, I need to email the seller again, he didn't reply yesterday when I told him to check the tracking number, he's probably forgot to send them after taking my money, or they've gone AWOL, it's very strange though I trusted him the most out of every place I get benzos

Better if you do something, if you're sat at the bar watching the football and being sociable, it becomes hard to focus and my limbs start shaking, but at a bit of music and something to occupy your mind and body, it becomes more euphoric and enjoyable.

I've had at least 2 while taking very high doses. It starts with very unpleasant myoclonic jerks until you just have a full blown seizure.


It only seems to happen if you go too high on your dose compared to your previous.

If you go the phenibut route be careful, I take outrageous doses of pregablin, like 1000 mgs at a time a couple times a day. Everyone said I probably won’t feel anything from pheni. So I get some and I take 1000 mgs to start and in a couple hours felt amazing! So I redose! Well I wound up in the ER getting narcan’d, to no affected course. They were gonna put me on a ventilator next. I had been in a super deep sleep. When I got home I discovered I had taken almost 4000mgs . I stick to my pregablin.

I have been on Lyrica for 6 years for neuropathy in my feet. Started at 150 mg a day for first couple years then 200mg for 4 years and just recently went to 300mg a day. It's the only drug that touches my nerve pain. Also works great on anxiety. Thankfully my tolerance hasn't been much at all. Don't see myself having to go up from 300mg. My Doctor told me that 300mg is the recommended dosage for nerve pain and anything above that won't work much better.

> I would say 300mg would be a good starting dose for someone not tolerant to GABAergics. Also, this isn't an anti-depressant, you don't need to wait a long period of time to feel its effects. We're talking about recreational drugs, lyrica takes a long time to kick in and that is 1-1.5hours oral. I have a mild GABA tolerance and find 900-1200mg a good dose but have taken 2400mg before and had fun so I wouldn't say you are at risk of ODing and having a bad time. In any case you sound like you would really benefit from some drug/lyrica education so read the lyrica/pregabalin megathread and whatever you can on here. The only real negative side effect I have experienced when you are at the 1000mg plus range is joint pain.

> 
> I would think 450 would be recreational for someone like you with 300 being conservative but hey if 300 or 225 (I gather you have 75mg tabs) even works for you then great. The problem with starting low is that the half life is 5-6 hours and it takes a while to kick in so by the time you wait and don't feel much then wait for it to kick in your system has eliminated a decent amount, so start somewhere reasonable. Definitely don't start below 200 and feel free to go up to 600.

I think pregabalin and benzos don't have cross tolerance. But I am quite certain pregabalin affects my gabaergic system. When I am to suffer a pregabalin withdrawal I found out that I can delay most of the digestive and insomnia symptoms with benzos. Bit tired and a running nose. When you stop benzos the withdrawal will kick bit softly but unavoidable.


"Pregabalin is selective in its binding to the α2δ VDCC subunit.[[62]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregabalin#cite_note-pmid16376147-62)[[63]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregabalin#cite_note-BenzonRathmell2013-63) Despite the fact that pregabalin is a [GABA analogue](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/GABA_analogue),[[64]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregabalin#cite_note-pmid10189176-64) it does not bind to the [GABA receptors](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/GABA_receptor), does not convert into [GABA](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%93-aminobutyric_acid) or another [GABA receptor agonist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/GABA_receptor_agonist) *[in vivo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo)*, and does not directly modulate GABA [transport](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurotransmitter_transport) or [metabolism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism).[[](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregabalin#cite_note-Uch2010-18) has been found to produce a dose-dependent increase in the brain [expression](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression) of [L-glutamic acid decarboxylase](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-glutamic_acid_decarboxylase) (GAD), the [enzyme](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme) responsible for [synthesizing](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosynthesis) GABA, and hence may have some indirect [GABAergic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/GABAergic) effects by increasing GABA levels in the brain.

There is currently no evidence that the effects of pregabalin are mediated by any mechanism other than inhibition of α2δ-containing VDCCs.[[62]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregabalin#cite_note-pmid16376147-62)[[68]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregabalin#cite_note-pmid23642658-68) In accordance, inhibition of α2δ-1-containing VDCCs by pregabalin appears to be responsible for its [anticonvulsant](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticonvulsant), [analgesic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analgesic), and [anxiolytic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiolytic) effects.[[62]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregabalin#cite_note-pmid16376147-62)[[68](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregabalin#cite_note-pmid23642658-68)."

##### Gabapentinoids - Gabapentin Megathread

dude this indian shit may not be good. Pregabalin DOES produce tolerance, but not as strong as benzos do. One day or two reset most of the tolerance, and if not just taper down and wait a bit.

I've done WAY more than 600mg. Pregabalin is notorious for rapid tolerance. I think it would probably take weeks or months of abstinence for tolerance to totally reset to zero

I agree with that. Tolerance skyrockets fast and goes down fast too. Other story are withdrawals, you might be successful at getting high again in a normal dose, but you'll get physically dependent again in no time, even just with one dose if you don't wait enough.


I was one of the lucky ones who didn't get withdrawals. I am not anymore.

Take around 300-600mg every few weeks too and really enjoy the effects.

Have had a week of just smashing the pregabs now nearing stupid doses 5 300 mg for breakfast then continue through day to around 4000mg to feel it will have to taper down . I hate pregab withdrawals but can not help myself. Have a hard time tapering so will do a quick week-long one get as low as I can and then just go through the shit

I need to take breaks from pregabalin to get it working again. Does it work if I only take 300mg for 2-3 days and then take 900mg or 1200mg? or something like that? Or should it just not take anything to make it work? 300mg helps a lot with my anxiety, stopping them to make it work seems difficult at the moment, I have covid and I am isolated.

I've been wondering if you should take Lyrica every 12 hours (medical use)? I've been taking it so, that I've taken the first dose in the morning and the second in the afternoon. Anyhow, yesterday I didn't take the second dose at all, and didn't feel much different. Soo, would it be more beneficial if I'd just take it once in the morning and once in the evening?

I'm curious about cross tolerance with Gabapentin. I take gabapentin occasionally, although I need around 4g staggered to feel good with "no tolerance", and even that isn't what it used to be, and if I dose even 6 grams a few days after that I'll get no effect. I haven't taken pregabalin in like 10 years, but just got a script for it. I havent had gabapentin in about two weeks. I started with 600mg. Hope its not underwhelming ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png) back in my hay day, 2g of gabapentin had me flying, and 3g having hallucinatory dream like state, but I seem to have permenantly destroyed that for myself.

I don't normally taper but have the last few times it helps. What I want to know is if im using about 5000 mg a day can I drop to say 1200mg without a withdrawal and then taper from there because 1200 mg should be enough in the system to stop wd thats what im hoping

If i were you man, I'd switch over to something more potent like f-phenibut and taper with that. Thats an extreme amount of pregabalin to be taking. Feeling this 600mg pretty good at t+1hr.


Fuck, gabapentinoids make cigarettes so good.


This stuff has the dirty feeling of alcohol though, compared to the awesome body high of gabapentin.

I doubt the sort of jump you are looking to do will be painless, but I've never been physically dependent, and don't understand the neurology of such a situation well enough to say for sure. You will probably withdraw a lot going from 5g to 1.5g. As for the phenibut, I think its actually less potent, but f-phenibut would be (anecdotally) more potent, and maybe easier to taper.


If i were in your situation, id taper with f-phenibut, and maybe use some benzos towards the end of it. Sorry to hear man, that really sucks. Best wishes ![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif)

Good thing is i have got a lot of pregabs so can taper slow if need be  thinking my pregab withdrawals normally last a week . I first use them for heroin withdrawl and had lots of pregab wd after that . Im thinking of even doing valium first few days to control anxiety and then jump back on the pregabs at a lower starting dose and taper from there . Thanks for your input brother i sort of know im gonna feel shit but jumping at a low dose be bettewr then at 5000mg i know what hell that is.

How does it go with valium? This 600mg feels like 1.5g of gabapentin should.  Or should I take another 300? Probably best to just take a benzo and try again in a week with 1g.

I very rarely take them, but im considering taking like 30-40mg diazepam. Id be concerned of blacking out with how similar this is to alcohol. But its extremely mild at 1.5 hours from 600mg. What I dont want to do is make my tolerance worse so next week when I take 1000mg it doesn't work, so I dont think ill take any more tonight.

If you leave it a week you be ok your tolerance won't be affected. The pregabs normally hit at 2.5-hour mark eat them on an empty stomach it works a lot better . I was blacking out on adding valium just 20 mg felt really good at first but i made the mistake of taking poppy pods aswell i fell asleep eating my bowl of fruity pebbles

Its been 2 weeks since I had gabapentin or any gabapentinoid, and a decade since I had lyrica, but 600mg is tangible but not as euphoric as I'd expect from 2g gabapentin even with no tolerance, and extremely mild. It's been about two hours since I took it, I think it peaks around now, no? I'm guessing with weekly breaks 1.5g is going to be my sweet spot with this one at this phase of my life, though ill try 1g next, then 1250, then 1500. I dont know if a week is even long enough, to where I'm not just going to burn out my receptors and get no good high in these experiments, considering 2 weeks wasnt enough, and months other times didn't reset to baseline.

What have you taken gabapentin or lyrica . Gabapentin i not had to many times but i think you have to take it in bits then eat a greasy meal then take some more to hit your sweet spot . From my expieriance from lyrica 2 weeks is good but leave it a month and even 300 mg of lyrica gives a day long buzz . Lyrica peaks at about 2 hour mark but lyrica works best on empty stomach but with gabapentin you have to eat with it to get a good buzz. I think gabapentin is 5 or six times less potent to lyrica im not sure but it is something like that my friend.

I think gabapentin is 5 or six times less potent to lyrica im not sure but it is something like that my friend.

> Always take your first dose of lyrica on empty stomach makes a huge differance did you eat before taking 600 mg of lyrica because if you not had it for a decade 600 mg should have you euphoric chatty and loving music. Im sorry if i not make sense i have had a shit load of lyrica and poppy pods and have a very fuzzy head

They are closely related drugs which cause a cross tolerance, thats the only reason I mention the gabapentin 2 weeks ago, which I think is the reason 600mg of lyrica that I should be essentially naieve to is so mild. 300mg wouldn't do anything for me. I think this class of drugs causes a permatolerance, or at least might take years to reset.


I took it on a completely empty stomache, with some carbonated soda.

After I wd from pregabs I won't touch them for a month or two but when I do 300 mg in the morning and 300mg in evening has me euphoric but i can depend on each person some lucky people don't get withdrawals on them . I think it could be you using gabapentin 2 weeks ago could be the reason it not hit give it a little while longer drink some coke and stay hungry i find food kills it for a while .

What dosage do you find works best to feel these effects and do you have to take long breaks to reset tolerance?


I have to be honest, I take quite high doses of Pregabalin but don't feel these type of effects - usually it helps me to sleep, but not much else.

I hardly ever take pregabalin.  Like 600mg will make me high as fuck.  I've taken it that high maybe 8 times in my time, over the course of 12 years.


But god damn that high is good.

Wow, I've taken way, way higher doses than that. Maybe it just affects people differently.


Or it could be that I have too great a tolerance, although I have given Preg a break for several weeks and it still doesn't seem to do much when I take it again.

Is there no one else to whom pregabalin did not high anymore? I used it recreationally between May and July 2019 in doses >400 some days and I no longer feel anything when I took it. I really liked its effect when I took it the first few times, but now I don't feel a damn thing. It's weird isn't it?


Is there cross tolerance between pregabalin and gabapentin, right? I have thought about buying gabapentin and trying it.

It is weird also because they are almost supposed to be the same pharmacodynamic. 

The pregabalin might possibly be more potent, seems to be my conjecture ?

Do you drink alcohol before or during pregabalin? My subjective experience is that alcohol nullifies pregabalin effects. Maybe the interaction with Tramadol does something similar, who knows. Pregabalin is a weird drug.


I abused pregabalin quite a lot and had many withdrawals and I still can get the quantitative effects as in the beginning when I don't have tolerance, the qualitative effects are not so euphoric anymore, still enjoyable though.

No man. I don't drink alcohol. I hardly ever drink alcohol. I also think it has something to do with tramadol (especially in high doses). In the past, I took lower doses and pregabalin and tramadol were wonderfully potentiated. In fact, it was one of my favorite combos.


PS. A little advice for guests reading the thread. NEVER take pregabalin and tramadol TOGETHER in HIGH DOSES, because there is a great chance of a seizure. I was about to seizure. And I am 100% sure that it was pregabalin, as I have never had a problem with tramadol, even at very high doses.

Without tolerance my usual dose is 225 to 300mg and I get euphoric effects from that and I look high to others. I did build my tolerance to over 1 gram in the past, but I don't do it anymore, when I get to 800mg or so I do quick tapperings and suffer some kind of withdrawal, harder or easier depending how fast I tapper and always quite long lasting, intestinal sympthoms being the worst part of it.


And yes, very puzzling drug with a huge intervariability among people. Just out of curiosity, do you get effects from phenibut? maybe the variability has something to do with GABAB, I know studies don't point to that, but my subjective experience is that the euphoria is very similar to GABAB drugs like phenibut o GHB, maybe GABAB is only activated in hipersensible people to the drug. Maybe not...

How long to you find you have to wait before tolerance is 'reset' to zero on Preg?


I sometimes have to take many grams to feel anything - like 9000 mg (9 grams) or something - sounds mad I know! ![😮](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f62e.png)) and even then I often don't feel anything. Even if I haven't taken any for weeks. So it is strange.


I'm not sure I would describe the effects of Preg as 'euphoric', but rather a pleasant spaced-out type of feeling (when it works anyway) Anyway it is frustrating when I take it and feel nothing from it.


I have tried phenibut but didn't feel much from it, although I haven't experimented with it as much. Not sure if phenibut is easy to come by any more in my country as it's a legal grey area. What is your method for taking phenibut and what kind of doses do you find work?

Phenibut is a weak drug. More of a mood enhancer than a proper high. I have used it between 1 gram and 3 grams. 3 grams is going overboard. Taking it in divided doses separated by 3 hours while fasting seems to work the best for me. I don't use it anymore though.


If you take 9 grams of pregabalin and don't feel anything I would think if your pregabalin is really pregabalin. If it is just forget about it, it is not for you. You are going to fuck your kidneys with such amounts. Pregabalin tolerance resets very fast for me. Maybe a couple of weeks I am in baseline. Problem is I can be not tolerant to pregabalin but get hook again physically if I don't wait more than that, maybe a month. So tolerance resets faster than the risk of going back to be psysically dependent.

It's definitely Pregabalin, but maybe it doesn't work for me or I just have an incredibly long tolerance reset. I also hear people advise that it should be taken on a very empty stomach. Having food in there perhaps stops it from working properly.


Is it known to screw up your kidneys? I have been worried about my liver but from what I've researched it doesnt seem to affect the liver much. Didn't consider kidneys. I wouldnt be surprised if taking that quantity probably is not going to be healthy in some way though.


I have taken many grams of kratom in my time, but I know that's a different drug altogether.

I take it always on an empty stomach, the very few times I didn't it decreased the effect and it took much longer to kick. Still got some effect though.


I don't think it is especially known for screwing the kidneys, but the metabolism of pregabalin is not affected by liver and seems that the kidneys are the responsible for it. In patients with a decreased kidneys function they take that into account and prescribe lower dosages, as this malfunction of the kidneys directly translates in higher plasma concentrations. Maybe you have hyperfunctioning kidneys that don't let you get enough pregabalin in your blood stream, maybe not. It is crazy you can take nine grams and don't feel much. But if you took it with success in the past, maybe you just fucked up whatever pregabalin affects in your brain and you need a long break until things go back to normal.


As well I have noticed that pregabalin deshidrates me a lot, as my urine gets very dark when I am on it or just after. Surely your urine should have been quite dark in your "experiment" with heroic dosages.

took 4.5 grams of Pregabalin a couple of hours ago and now I'm feeling it - it's fun, kind of spaced out feeling, but I'm still in control of my senses (I think!)

Well I've taken even higher doses and it's had no effect and I don't pass out. Preg is strange - some people feel the effects at doses like 300mg but that does nothing for me. And I don't think it's a tolerance issue because I go for weeks or months without taking any Preg but I still need pretty high doses to feel anything. I still think they're safer than Benzos though, but as with all drugs you have to be as careful as possible

Can get effects from 600mg up to around a gram but I don’t tend to go over 900mg these days. Now with lockdown on Boxing Day here the days are going to be even longer but at least we’ll be a bit safer.

Is this like ghb ? I’m from Canada and since not too long ago I’m a heavy ghb user. I take a vial measurement which I THINK is 4ml each time and a bottle of 60ml lasts me 2days now.... for me I find that it has this almost immediate heartbeat raise when I take it that I never thought of taking it before bed and still feel it when u wake up. Also I’m on my first day off a ghb trip That lasted a week or so... I am sweating from my fingertips, anxious, sad, moody. All of which I was prepared for but I just wanted some advice on how to first help my body recover from this trip and maybe tips on tapering and use the drug more wisely and gracefully. 

thank you I don’t know how to work this website yet

Hey love 

I am in a very similar situation.. on my first day fully off it right now. I’m realizing cold turkey would be impossible, especially that my parents don’t know about it. Could you pls explain more to me you’re tapering off technique ? Like what was your daily dosage ? Did you do only 1-2 days a week using it or u reduced the amount u used daily ?

I have cold turkeyed lyrica from high dose (600-900 prescribed for pain) daily use few times and it's bad. I have tapered it very slowly from same dose, like 25mg every 3 days and it was kinda ok but still horrible. Once I did a fast taper from 600mg, like 75 mg every day and it felt the best for me, at 150mg I dropped 50mg and after that 25mg a day.


I felt so energetic a day after tapering the dose in the fastest method but I didn't sleep more than 2-4h for months. Slow taper 0-4h sleep 6 months. Cold turkey no sleep for long time and felt like having severe brain injury. The stupidest thing here is that the cold turkeys was doctors suggestions when they didn't it was addicting when it got out to sales.


I'm talking about years long daily use. I still use it some times, but never daily, weekly or even monthly.


I promise if you taper it you will feel normal faster then you think. I was taking huge doses for years. Don't be afraid of it but think you're going to do it for yourself!

Anyone experience any long term mental / cognitive issues from taking pregabalin?


I don’t seem to be able to find my words anymore, like the words don’t appear in my mind & I end up sounding really dumb. I also don’t seem to think about anything before I go to sleep anymore. I’m not sure if it’s from 5htp or pregabalin. I slowly tapered off it a long time ago but still feel it. If so, any tips to improve cognitive ability?

I've read that Pregabalin can stop neurons from working or something - I don't know how much truth there is in that. 


I suggest trying to keep your brain active with cognitive exercises - get a 'Dummies guide' type book about mathematics and work your way through it, doing all the exercises. Do puzzles, brain-training games etc

Just curious, when would one start to feel the effects of lyrica withdrawal after last dose? I've been taking 200mgs every day for 14 days before bedtime for restless leg syndrome. My last dose was almost 48hrs ago and I currently feel fine. Read alot of people say how bad withdrawal is so even though it works great for RLS I no longer want to take it daily. I've been through opiate withdrawal and it sucks, don't want to withdrawal from this stuff either.

Everyone's body is different...if you've only been taking this for two weeks, I'd think you'd be ok.  IMO only.  I have had nasty withdrawal from Lyrica.  Mainly brain zaps, where I get a headache and feel shocks in my body.  However I had been on Lyrics for years.  Hopefully you don't experience any of the nasty side effects.  Sounds like you're doing well though.

Edit: 200mgs a day is also a pretty small dose.  I currently take 600mgs per day.

With years experience I'd say rebound symptoms would have already started if your body would be dependent on it. 


For me the actual wd symptoms starts the second evening wo it from high dose. I might even feel good that time. My bodily symptoms gets worse every day for about a week then it's just better days and very bad days.


This is from years daily high dose use for pain.


I have had worse wd from it then any benzo or opioid...

Doses over 600mg causes bad things on me these days with no tolerance. I was prescribed 900mg for few years and 600mg for many years. Few things to mention: cognitive problems, I don't remember the term in english but bad muscle twitching that makes me drop stuff I'm carrying, light insomnia and heavy sweating After 48h.


Now to think I was dropping stuff when I had tolerance to it too if the dose was too high.

Muscle twitching is a thing for me too but I've never dropped anything because of a twitch. I don't get the same pleasure from it anyway, even if I give tolerance breaks. So this month when I get prescribed again I'm planning on to limit myself for a max dosage of 600-750mgs each time. Weed and pregabalin is the only way that I can de-stress in the environment that I live, if I could provide myself unlimited weed I'd only smoke that, but it's expensive to buy weed and I don't want to hurt myself using lyrica, physically or psychologically. So wish me luck for the next time, I hope I can control my demons.

What do you mean by tolerance breaks? I mean at least two months of no gaba substances preferably more. 


If you have tolerance to it you might be surprised how easy it is to drop your dose a bit. I can't use it anymore daily because it dries my mouth, nose and eyes to the point nose and mouth bleeding every morning.


I got almost the same effects from 450mg then 600mg when tapering. Sleep problems started when I got under 300mg and rebound anxiety at 150mg. Still easy.


It would make you feel so much better if you knew you don't need it as much as you think, so give it a thought.

My tolerance breaks are usually like 4-7 days, but since I don't have any, I don't use it for 15 days today. I've never tried to give a two months break honestly. Also have sleep problems all my life and anxiety about it. I always use the staggering method. This time I'll give it a try. Taper 450mg or 600 at max.


I'm currently kind of disturbed about how much I abuse that substance. I even consider to quit it completely, if I can change the current situation in my life (unemployment-quarantine-depression). When you don't have a thing to do, you get bored and want to get high sadly. Thanks for the replies and advice.

From my experience it's like alcohol in the sense that one taking big doses once in a while is More harmful to the brains then taking little every day.


If you are only having one week off of it I suspect you might be in wd all that time. After long time use it takes months for autonomous nervous system to get back in order. I mean you might be feeling a lot better if you took that few months break.


I excercise a lot and it has helped a ton with the pain, mind and everything. Luckily we don't have quarantine, at least yet.

I take a vial measurement which I THINK is 4ml each time and a bottle of 60ml lasts me 2days now.... for me I find that it has this almost immediate heartbeat raise when I take it that I never thought of taking it before bed and still feel it when u wake up. Also I’m on my first day off a ghb trip That lasted a week or so... I am sweating from my fingertips, anxious, sad, moody. All of which I was prepared for but I just wanted some advice on how to first help my body recover from this trip and maybe tips on tapering and use the drug more wisely and gracefully.

Just saw this post so I’m late to the game but I’m wondering how you are doing. Just wanted to let you know that once you reach the point you’re at there is no graceful return. I have SO BEEN THERE, and if there was a way I would have made it work. There is only dependence on booze and benzos, trips to the ER, car wrecks and near death misses. If you escape what you are describing don’t ever go back. The paranoid fear, shaking and sweating, feeling like your hands aren't yours, the extreme thirst, water retention, jaw tightness, shattering anxiety - It’s not fucking worth it and you will quite literally lose your mind. Get on a benzo TAPER quickly so you can sleep and eat. GHB is not child's play, and after 2 or 3 years you will destroy your life and after 7 (me) you will be desperately trying to piece it back together. One dose now would put me RIGHT back in.  GHB is the best, worst drug EVER, and it is the true opposite of grace.

That was the best advice I have ever heard anyone give.

It’s like getting out of the mafia, and it doesn’t matter what drug you’re on. Once you go through the worst part of the wd’s, just stay away.

We all play this game: I have it under control. I’m not going to run out. What day is it? Crap, I’m going to run out! I’ll just taper with what I still have. Well, if I’m going to be in wd tomorrow anyway.....  might as well enjoy today right?

Then we go through sometimes horrible withdrawals. And instead of learning from our mistakes, we do it all over again.

Lyrica wd’s are no joke. All of the stuff they prescribe it for (the list is really long). Like depression, anxiety, insomnia, nerve pain(that’s me), etc.  It all comes forward with a vengeance when you quit. Benzos can actually kill you with a seizure if you cold turkey them, but Lyrica wds will make you wish you were dead.

I have never taken more than about 300 mg daily, but when I get myself down to 150mg/day, I usually spend a week there. Then cut to 100mg for a week, then drop by 25mg a week at a time until zero. No wd’s.

There’s a documentary on YouTube. It’s by “BBC3” called “Drugs maps of Britan: Belfast Buds” That episode follows a man about 25 or 30 years old. He’s on a crap load of prescriptions, but they’re specifically following him for the pregablin. He snorts it every time.

I can’t imagine it’s better snorted. Half gets stuck in the guy’s snot. 

Besides, it tastes like powdered dog crap. Snorting it must be pretty awful.

If you really want to f up your life. Try taking a moderate dose for you, like a good maintenance dose but on the upper end of almost enough to catch a buzz. Then get really drunk. The last time I did that I woke up in the kitchen naked and pissing into a cereal bowl with my kids playing video games in the next room. I woke up just in time to see the bowl was about to overflow and barely made it to the sink. I don’t know how I got there, and I couldn’t believe nobody saw me. I can only imagine what would have happened if I dreamed I needed to drive somewhere.

^ yeah this documentary


I don't know what the advantage of snorting is, although the counsellor says the effects come on faster but also last for a shorter time. Anyway, the amount of Pregabalin I take, snorting would be unfeasible... ![😵](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f635.png)

Snorting is beyond pointless for many reasons, including the amount of powder needed. I have used alcohol with lyrica both in high doses and it sure made my coordination go worse but nothing special.

do you mean alcohol can potentiate the effects of Pregabalin? As in it screws up your coordination? Sounds fun if that's what you're looking for

Snorting it DOES work, but swallowing it is definitely stronger. 

Snorting definitely comes on quicker though.

I have a feeling that for most it potentiates it too much. Mostly unpleasant effects get potentiated at high doses. Just my experience. I wouldn't suggest the combo for anyone. I could take huge amounts of benzos with alcohol just trying to sleep and i never blacked out. Lyrica is a another thing. I haven't used alcohol and lyrica much and will never do it again but in low doses it was quite enjoyable for a person who don't like alcohol.


Pregabalin surely will work by snorting but as stated there's other factors which imo makes it pointless. Pregabalin is absorbed by lat1 as is all gababentinoids to my knowledge. For example baclofen is absorbed quite rapidly from nasal passages. Read it from a study some time ago.

Pregabalin is strange - it seems to have an incredibly rapid tolerance onset.


Last night I took 25 x 300mg capsules and felt nothing. Didn't pass out or anything either ![🤨](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f928.png)

Thats a pretty mad dose. I saw my friend do a similar dose (nearly 2 strips of 300mg, cant remember how manys in a strip, 14 iirc) and he had a seizure on his back and was puking up froth, lucky i was there as i had to roll him over because he was choking. He had a pretty tolerance too, but we had been drinking alot and doing speed and k for days.

yes ![:oops:](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f633.png) Either I have a mad tolerance or Preg just doesn't affect me.


I have gotten effects from much smaller doses. Usually a kind of enjoyable slightly spaced-out feeling. That's what I'm aiming for


but other times I don't get anything. It's a strange drug. I do think having an empty stomach can be a significant factor

damn, lucky you were there. I generally don't combine drugs because then it's hard to tell which is working. I might try Preg with a little alcohol next time, but not for a while as I need to take a Preg break to get my tolerance down

I have read like thousands of studies on gababentinoids and the most prominent reason for rapid tolerance I have seen comes from hypothesis that it affects some part of Gaba system. 


If one wants to feel pregabalin at its full force, no benzo or alcohol use for some time. I have taken very big doses with almost no effects with tolerance.


Month or a two is a tolerance break for big doses imo to get the full effects and not getting any rebound symptoms.


Baclofen and pregabalin or gababentin together makes my coordination go worse then booze and benzos. It happens always like 8-10h after taking lyrica.


I read a study on lyrica for postoperative pain In

surgery, where peeps were given one 300mg dose. Interesting thing in that study was that pregabalins amount in spinal fluid was maxed at 8h after taking it which in my mind makes the 6h half-life seems very odd. 


I apologise my language.

Wondered about this myself.

Hell... I do not even start to get the full "feeling" until 5-6hrs later. Same with phenibut hcl but the pregab builds whereas the phenibut hits at once. Seems all gabapentinoids have this time-lapse to full on effects for me.

Not really, no. Pregab makes me feel "drunken" and dis-functional in high doses whereas phenibut sharpens my senses and I can multi-function with no issues.

Kinda like polar opposite for me come to think about it.

To be honest, I do not notice a difference if taken on an empty stomach, partial full or full with any gabapentinoid; the ones I am familiar with seem to go well with food. I will say that with pregab, after I start to feel the effects, the more I eat the "higher" I seem to get. Wierd.

Never have tried this. Had someone send me a sample with some phenibut hcl but ended up trashing them after reading up on it here at BL... helped me make a more informed decision which I absolutely am grateful for.


Damn, just realized Imma have phenibut for *years*.... Excited to try the FAA option and if I switch over will have a lot of surplus. Glad I found this stuff as if I dose high it does have a sedating effect on me and will sleep it off. Love that about this stuff.

- Do you mean you think Modafinil might be dangerous or ineffective?


- What do you find is your optimal dose of Phenibut for sharpening your senses? (And what is an FAA Option?)


- re. Pregabalin - do you find it has a rapid tolerance onset, and how long a break do you have to give it to reset tolerance?


cheers!

I do in fact build tolerance quickly with any of the gaba family drugs. However... I try to keep doses fairly low (for me) for maintenance and only dose to re-create less than twice a week. With this schedule I do not seem to have much tolerance to any of them, keeps the efficacy efficient and protects me from serious withdrawals... which is a must as I am fragile.

I’ve tried Modafinil with Pregabalin a few times a short while back and enjoyed the combo. I like the sedating properties of Pregabalin too much though haha.

Phenibut was never a nootropic. Calling it one just makes it easier to sell because it makes people think it's not dangerously addictive and seem innocuous. Any nootropic type effects are solely through its mechanism of action, it doing its job as a synthetic analogue of GABA. If you're not achieving what you were looking for at 2 grams, I would quit while you're ahead.

If you go back through this thread from the beginning you can read several accounts regarding Pregablin and just how crazy fast tolerance builds. Something like opiates takes weeks to build a noticeable tolerance from the first use. Same with alcohol or benzos. Pregablin builds a very noticeable tolerance in one day. 

From having had nothing in a week it takes me 300 mg to pass out (2 hours later, starting on an empty stomach). The very next day its more like 450 mg for the same effect. And by day 3, 300 is what it takes just to stop my wds, probably 700-800 mg to pass out again. 

Nothing has the ability to build tolerance like Pregablin, and it’s got the worst wds of anything. Benzos can give you a seizure, but Pregablin will make you carve out your own eyeballs with a spoon.

It’s fun, but really only for once or twice per week. If you can’t stop yourself generally from using something every day then Pregablin would be a giant mistake.

If low dose yes, otherwise many might be thinking why they are feeling bad after not taking it. 


For me once a week is too much. Tested about a year. Works yes but whole week in something like minor wd. I bet I'm not the only one.

Hi guys hope you're all surviving lockdown.

Ok so I have been trying phenibut as a possible lever to slowly replace the pregablin that I am prescribed currently 600mg daily. 

So far I have tried the phenibut hcl capsules 400mg and at a dose of about 2g there was a definite tangible effect similar but not the same as pregablin. I moved in then to phenibut FAA which is almost pH neutral and can be insufflated or taken sublingualy which is reported to increase the BA up to 70%. Now let me talk about the FA powder.

The powder is extremely fluffy, it's like a finely ground flour. It sticks together and is hard to chop and line up. That being said I did persevere and have used it up to about 2g via this roa, I did not feel anything close to the effect of the HCL, it was as close to tasteless as it could be Vs the HCL which tastes like shit and burns like a poker if insufflated. 

I wonder if there is a cross tolerance with my pregablin and therefore I was getting diminishing returns on the FAA.

Having finished the 25g bag of FAA I am left thinking that the HCL seemed to work better even though FAA is reported to be both stronger in it's concentration of phenibut and up to 30% more effective via the 2 ROA, sublingually or insufflated. Also to snort enough for a dose was a feat in itself given its fluffy expansive consistency.

In conclusion my subjective evidence contradicts the science but to me the ingested HCL dose worked better than the FAA.

Can anyone advise me with some anicdotal evidence of the best formulation and ROA for other people? 


Many thanks

Peace and love

BBlunt

Ofc there's big cross tolerance with all gababentinoids.pregabalin can imo be replaced only by gababentin or ethanol, baclofen and phenibut helps but not nearly the same. Don't overuse those or get ready for trouble. If someones not getting good effects on pregabalin regardless of dose, taper and stop for some time. You'll thank yourself later that I promise!


It's actually sick that it makes my pain problems go like 10 times worse. Not all the time but at times. Even got diagnosed pretty sick shit because of it.

Hey Santa, thanks for the advice, I take pregablin for chronic Pancreatitis and it works wonderfully, I have been on it for well over 2 years but I am concerned about how I will ever get off of it, abstaining for days increases my pancreatic pain but I don't notice the withdrawals so I am in a catch 22, I'd like to hold off so that I can enjoy the dose but I can't stay off for too long.

Just taper it. For me fast taper was easiest. I have been prescribed it for pain like a decade. I thought it was helping my pain but when stopped i noticed it was it's rebound symptoms causing the worst pain. 


I think it's pharmacology kinda explains why it could cause chronic pain. I have seen many studies saying there's too many a2d subunits in peeps with chronic pain. Preg binds to a2d and in many cases it makes the body to compensate by making more subunits etc. This is just stupid speculation from a guy who doesn't know enough to say things like that.

I am also on 20 mgs of lexapro (SSRI)

But with dam Covid and no longer to get to the gym safely My radiation pain in my neck, shoulders,and head sucks ( But I did not Die : Right?!)

One day at a time Iceman, that is the way forward, I mean I have epilepsy and since 40% of people with this diagnosis die from an epilepsy related incident. I could die at any time and be totally unaware it has happened, so now I live one day at a time, I appreciate every joy I have and love my life

You are sober now and that is one hell of an achievement. If you fall off the wagon do not waste any energy assessing or investing any time and effort into feeling bad or self depreciative just get back on and try harder.

Suffering with pain is one bitch monkey to have on your back but it also keeps you grounded and focused . If you can manage with less meds than prescribed then good for you, stockpile your surplus incase your supply is ever interrupted.  You could get blasted by a super volcano ![🌋](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f30b.png), massive solar flare, earthquake, hurricane, psychopath, drunk driver. Anything can happen any day so living one day at a time is the best way forward. 

If your wobbling always throw up a post here and ask for help, you never know which supportive brother in arms may be online to give you some words that resonate with you and gird your strength

One day at a fking time is almost Buddhist.

Hey iceman,

Just a quick note, I was prescribed gabapentin for a while before pregablin. It is much less potent than pregablin and in my opinion 300mg is a very low dose. I was taking grams a day before the switch so don't worry too much about taking 300mg for sleeping I think you will be absolutely fine at that dose .

I would say yes; the pregab is affecting the phenibut effects. I just acquired some FAA recently and notice very little regarding difference with hlc phenibut. The FAA has to turn to hcl anyway in the guts so not sure what the whole deal is with it. Maybe if snorted or placed under the tongue but this seems too much work to get roughly the same returns, IMO. There is no way I can sit for an hour while a g and a half of faa melts under my tongue. And no way imma put all that powder up my nose. So just gonna stick with the hcl.

Pregab is a *lot *more psychoative by weight than phenibut in my experience. They may have a similar/different action but IMO they both have their +/-'s.

Seems that phenibut (in my usage) has been able to stave off *serious* withdrawals from pregabalin at a dose of 3:1 ratio. Not inferring in the least that phenibut can replace pregabalin (or any other substance), just putting this out there for reasons of maybe helping one avoid a potentially fatal situation if caught out on some serious abuse of pregabalin.

Wow bruv, that's a hardcore situation your in, I can't imagine how much pain the medical issue and life's caltrops randomly hitting you at the same time could feel like, but to date you have been equal to the challenge. 

Just remember that every morning you wake up, your still here.

I joined a little while back when I needed some help then I dropped off a bit I think because this lockdown has had an agoraphobic effect on not just on me but I have observed it in many of my family and friends but the site has been sitting in the back of my mind for a while, so now I feel better I checked back in.

The thing about this site is that if you're being serious it's very honest, most people on here drop all the masks and bravado bullshit and will give you a straight answer from their perspective. Looking at your issue from a different angle is crucial to changing your view of it which in turn alters how you feel about it. You can't bullshit yourself for long so occasionally some answers you receive will force you to confront something you may have been avoiding, but for real it's almost always better to rip off the bandaid and look at the wound and work out with guidance how to heal it. Every moment you avoid (and we all fking do it) an issue, it grows a little bigger so although it's painful sometimes it's nearly always cathartic.

I feel that if I am ever wobbling or even teetering on a brink, at any time of any given day, I recon I could come here and someone who doesn't know me from shit will take the time to listen and feedback to me. That is a powerful ally to have in your pocket.

I am really glad that I logged in today, I got to meet you, I got some advice from Santa ![🎅](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f385.png) and I just feel a little less disconnected.

I take a vial measurement which I THINK is 4ml each time and a bottle of 60ml lasts me 2days now.... for me I find that it has this almost immediate heartbeat raise when I take it that I never thought of taking it before bed and still feel it when u wake up. Also I’m on my first day off a ghb trip That lasted a week or so... I am sweating from my fingertips, anxious, sad, moody. All of which I was prepared for but I just wanted some advice on how to first help my body recover from this trip and maybe tips on tapering and use the drug more wisely and gracefully.

Twilight222 is right and speaks from experience....Though maybe it depends on why you're taking it? I've taken it for over 10 years 24/7 but I'd never willingly take a 4ml dose, I never take more than 1.7ml every hour in the day (perhaps every 2 or 3 hours at night)...what's the benefit of taking that higher dose? For me after 1.7 you're just spaced out, you won't be able to function in the real world and people might think you're an odd f*cker!! lol....and that's if you're lucky. Lots of bad stuff stuff can and will happen if you overdo it...I started taking it myself because I was a semi-alcoholic and got a liver test result from a medical at work which showed high toxicity etc....found GBL and transition was easy....but if you've not got a drink problem you probably don't want to start taking GBL on a regular basis because you'll end up hooked on one or the other. As I already had the alcohol problem, GBL was by far the healthier option (won't go into depth for why, just trust me)


I took the alcohol and the GBL to self medicate, wasn't for kicks, not a social thing ( though G is great if you're lacking in that respect, in my case I was diagnosed Aspergers a few years ago, in my mid-50's now)..G has many benefits, the main ones for me being it's a mood enhancer/anti-depressant.


Another thing, when you say it gives you a 'heartbeat raise', you don't mean that literally, do you? It should have the opposite effect on your heart etc. I guess you just meant it gives you a lift? But 4ml though, jesus. That's something else.


Anyway, sorry I've rambled on a bit, too much information maybe, beginning to bore myself!. Be careful.

I used Lyrica to quit my xanax (~2.5 mg / day) use. It worked great, used 300mg lyrica, and felt euphoria comparable to Heroin. Dropped my xanax use to 0.5 mg/day, then .25, then within a week stopped xanax with not much problem. I thought wow this is great. I heard Lyrica can be addictive too, around the time was using about 450mg / day. started tapering, within a couple weeks was down to almost zero use without any withdrawal. Wander full I thought. 


Then I restarted my stimulant weekend use, and instead of xanax to combat the side effects, used lyrica. Long story short, was using lyrica around 600-900 mg /day for 5-6 months. Side effects right from start were pretty bad, sexual, -can't orgasm at all while on it (anyone else have this problem?), then my extremities started going numb, fingers, toes. Then impotence. Tried quitting , no way in hell, worse withdrawal then opiate and benzos. 


Tapered to 150mg / day for a few weeks with help of benzos, then 2 weeks ago down to 20mg/ day for a week, then last 7 days I've been lyrica free. 


But I had to increase my benzo use to some 3-4mg xanax to function and not go crazy. And I still feel like shit no matter how much benzos i take. Still have numb toes, still have some sexual side effects which seem to be improving. Basically I'm back where I started plus  all the damage I've done. Never touch this drug again.


I can't seem to taper benzos, smallest decrease throws me into bad withdrawal, I simply went through too many benzo withdrawals and they just get worse each time. I don't know what to do now. ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)

Did you feel euphoria despite taking pregabalin every day? Pregabalin is great but when I take it every day the euphoria is non-existent.

is it true that Pregabalin and Gabapentin deplete your magnesium?


If so, should I take magnesium supplements before and/or after using them?

There is no official established conversion between gabapentin and pregabalin, nevertheless, medical resources usually claim gabapentin to be roughly 1/6th the potency of pregabalin, so 300mg would be equivalent to only 50mg of pregabalin. Coupled with the fact it is more poorly absorbed and it's even less.

I've took pregabs for the third time on Saturday night 600mg, the last time was Nov 450mg and time before that was September, 450mg.


Monday night and yesterday were terrible, felt like I was heading into WD. Could the 1 dose of pregabs do that?


I've also had 10zop, 2mg xanax and 4 ambien and 800mg of tram in the last 6 weeks. I know I was getting waves of euphoria on the lyrica wondering if it scrambled my gaba receptors and they were trying to heal, head was tingly yesterday. Along with the zops etc it soon racks up I guess.


Don't think I'll touch lyrica again.


I'm switching my Sunday zop to phenergen, need to get off all gabaergic substances.

Hi all, just a quick question, is there any interaction between pregabalin and meth?


Whether it be increase in effects, no increase in effects or block in effects?


Im not trying to get high.

I never did meth, but from my experience with pregabalin I think it would affect amphetamines in general. It depends on the dosages but pregabalin has mode of action that is "depressing" or you can call it inhibitory or relaxing. It is used as anti seizure medication(anticonvulsant), anxiolytic agent and for neuropathic pain. It is a gabapentinoid and (indirectly unlike benzodiazepines but still) raises GABA levels. Full mode of action is not understood, but you can see where this is going.


Pregabalin calms/slows the nervous system and in that way is in direct opposition with stimulants. Based on that and my subjective experience I believe that in your case it would mean

That doesn't mean it is not useful as medication if combined with Desoxyn (you said that you are not trying to get high so I extrapolated).


If you are prescribed both than take as prescribed and then see with your doctor. I am not a medical professional and can give you only subjective experience coupled with my (very) limited understanding of neuro science, general biology and pharmacology.


Take care!

You mentioned you did some benzos recently.  If you've been addicted before, then an effect known as kindling means that you will get rebound anxiety from any benzo use, and will become physically dependent MUCH more quickly, forever.  It's most likely due to the benzos you took.  One dose of pregabalin isn't going to cause withdrawals, if you've never been addicted to pregabalin you could take it daily for a week and probably wouldn't have any withdrawals.  Pregabalin actually doesn't affect GABA, despite its name.  It's a gabapentinoid, which, though similar to GABA in structure, actually act by being voltage-dependent calcium channel blockers, and not by affecting GABA receptors.  This has a range of downstream effects, but it does not share a mechanism of action with stuff like benzos and alcohol.

Unfortunately it won't be available on prescription. It's only prescribed for Narcolepsy, as Xyrem....and even that is prescribed sparingly as Xyrem is very expensive. Googled it just and price is £22000 for a litre of xyrem (which to me seems to be exactly the same chemical as GBL)....and yet pure GBL bought for cleaning and whatever in Europe can be bought for £70 a litre. That's quite a markup. I think Xyrem may be cheaper in europe, but still....G is also used in Italy (and Austria, I think) for Alcohol withdrawal/craving reduction( as Alcover). It's very good at that. In a bad phase of my life I switched from a six month stretch of 750ml Vodka everyday, where I had trouble getting out of bed in the end, straight over to G, with no overlap and it was totally seamless with no  problems whatsoever. The research studies into G for conditions such as Fibromyalgia and Alcohol you can count on the fingers of one hand, they all sing it's praises but all mention in their conclusions that it's banned in the states because of it's abuse potential. I guess most research has to be funded and if drug companies don't want to or realise it'd be futile, it won't happen.


I should think G would work better than your pain pills. G works on many more levels, would improve you socially, a mood enhancer.

Pain pills you get prescribed, G never will be. If you're in Europe G is quite easily obtained, but it's definitely illegal....and due to it being used in well publicised serial rape cases/murders, I guess it has to be that way. It's a shame it's not cheaper and prescribed for Alcohol withdrawal, maybe as an alternative ant-depressant.

Let's be honest now. Phenibut is "considered a nootropic" because nootropic vendors sell it, that's about it. Shit, they sell tianeptine. Next will people be calling *that* awful stuff nootropic?

how much Preg do you take? I find that no amount of abstinence will reset your tolerance back to zero with Preg, but that may be just me.


Also I've heard that taking Magnesium supplements with it might help

has anbody tried snorting Pregabalin? Could it make the effects felt faster/stronger?


So far the only thing that seems to make Preg work better for me is having an empty stomach. Like not eating all day

I must admit that I suffer from (mental) pregabalin addiction. I've managed to withdraw from it several times, as well as from alcohol and benzos. The strange thing is that I don't suffer from addiction to alcohol and benzos anymore, but pregabalin is more addictive for me. And it's been for several years. As strange as it may sound, it's the only drug I feel addicted to, and have cravings for. I'm high on it again right now, and I just love it. I did have a few seizures from it a few times, but now when I add Valproate I don't get any twitches or seizures anymore.


For me pregabalin is just a wonder drug. Like a combination of alcohol, benzos, GHB and weed. Completely obliterates all anxiety, I get motivated and energetic, euphoric and social. Of course, it's not euphoric like e.g. MDMA, but I really can't manage more than a few weeks and then again I take huge amounts of pregablin (usually 1200mg+) to get high. Of oll drugs I've used in my life (and there are many), pregabalin is the only drug I have a more or less continuous craving for.


Are there any others in the same situation? I don't feel that the addiction is out of hand (at least yet), but it is a bit worrying that I can't get my thoughts away from it.

I agree - Pregabalin, when it works, does feel good - kind of spaced out, trippy, but not in an unpleasant way. You say 1200mg is a huge amount, but I've taken way more, sometimes several grams to get the good feeling. And at that amount there's a danger of blacking out, although I don't think they're as risky as Benzos in that respect. I do worry taking such high doses might have other unwanted effects as it's a relatively new drug so there are unknowns about it.


The problem with Pregabalin is the rapid onset of tolerance. Often I get nothing from it even after weeks of abstinance, so it's strange. I envy people who can take a couple of capsules and feel good. I'm not sure my tolerance will ever reset

Cyclizine is generally an opioid thing. Can make morphine type opiates heavenly. And I'm sure it's great with IV methadone too. It's great orally..

Noticed no real improvements or synergy with cyclizine and lyrica.


Has anyone tried ordering ~1kg amounts from china?


Makes the prices much more available. Like crazy cheap.

I've read a lot about tolerance to Lyrica. Does the tolerance build up affect just the high, or, if you're taking it for nerve pain (similar to diabetic nerve pain), does long term use diminish the relief you get from nerve pain. I ask because I'm supposed to take 150 mg three times a day, but I take it only twice a day since I can't afford even the copay.  My dosage hasn't been changed in over 5 years, but even at 2 times daily I get tolerable relief. Thanks.

Peace.

Tolerance will likely affect its analgesic effects, though it will do it very slowly if you keep a strict schedule without dose variation and individual variability could play a role. If it works go on like that and if you feel you need more you could probably go higher as long as you can afford it. As you said you get tolerable relief I would probably keep on your dose if I was in your shoes, but you are probably the one who is in a better position to evaluate it.

When I say "tolerable relief" I mean I get pins and needles in my feet quite often. If that goes to the next stage, then I have to go to 3 times a day, and just somehow afford it. The generic is only a few dollars cheaper for some reason. (Greed?).

Do you get the pain in the last hours before the next dose? I haven't used it for medical reasons, but to avoid the worst of withdrawal I have used your kind of schedule while tapering. When the dose is quite short I was starting to feel some withdrawal symptoms if I just used a twice a day schedule, thing that didn't happen if I use it three times a day.


It is very unfortunate you have to feel pain for economic reasons. Pharma industry is quite a mafia.

I wouldn’t say I’m dependent on benzos but I’m definitely having some rebound anxiety in between doses. Supposedly this doesn’t act directly on your gaba receptors so would this help ease rebound symptoms without exacerbating them? Always trying to find a loophole.

I personally have never used it for anxiety when coming of benzos but they do have anxiolytic properties that bind to deffirent receptors so it might work but i will wait for someone more clued up on that part to respond

Yeah I heard there’s some cross tolerance so it makes me think it might prolong rebound symptoms. It’s been forever since I’ve had lyrica. Glad I found a cheap source. Just ordered 60 300 mg caps. Hope it gets past customs.

Although lyrica works through a different mechanism of action I’ve heard there may be an indirect cross tolerance between the two.

I’m fairly certain there’s some form of cross tolerance, but it’s a mystery as it supposedly doesn’t alter GABA levels in the brain even though it’s a gaba derivative. I’m hoping it will help alleviate my rebound anxiety as I’ve been hitting the GABA-a receptors pretty hard the past couple weeks or so with benzos and somas.


Last time I checked my package made it to America, but not through customs. I’ve had 80% of my packages intercepted by them this past year or so. Hopefully this gets through. I haven’t had the pleasure to try it in 6+ years.

Sweet, my lyrica just came today. Would you say it doesn’t inhibit the trip as much as benzos? I often have anxiety tripping but benzos tend to reduce the effects quite a bit.

In my experience, it may decrease some aspects of the trip a bit but not completely, like benzos

I feel like the benzos really kill the trip. I get used to not taking benzos on the days that I am going to consume some psychedelic and I only use lyrica for anxiety.

Yeah benzos are better to have to abort a bad trip when you can't take it anymore but it's better to ride it out. Lyrica would help for sure but takes a while to kick in. If you like take a little just before the acid and it should help with the intense come up

That’s good to hear. I always tend to have a rough come up but benzos destroy trips for me. I’m just going to try out the lyrica on its own. I don’t have a tolerance but I do take gabapentin daily. How much should I consume? I have 300mg caps.


Tomorrow I’m thinking of taking some al-lad, mdma, and lyrica. I see no reason as to why this combo won’t be glorious.

3-600mg depending on tolerance. I'd take 3. Or you could split the capsule and only eat half the powder and take 1.5 caps? I don't think 600 would kill a trip tho

I got some thumping E pills and al-lad I’m going to do tomorrow with a small dose of lyrica. I tried 600 mg today and all it did was make me tired and out of it. Perhaps my daily gabapentin use ruined its desirable effects.

Definitely. Just take an e and the acid and if it's too intense remember it will pass. In an hour you'll be giggling at yourself and looking at the fridge melting and the wallpaper jumping and swirling and be fine.

My last few trips have been very underwhelming unfortunately. 450 mics of al-lad didn’t have those amazing visuals I used to get. I’m hoping the addition of mdma and a little ketamine will do the job. I’ve never done ket, psychs, and mdma so it should be interesting.

And for me I don't feel pregabalins FX best until next day. Or if you must order some phenibut or clonazepam which won't kill ya trip as much as other be zos.

Seriously tho try riding it out. It's worth it.

I can’t handle high dosages of shrooms. For me the mind fuck is more pronounced. I prefer lsd or it’s derivatives. I’m stoked to try out these E pills. They’re suppose to contain 200mg + of mdma. I’m sure a little pregabalin combined with psychs, Mdma, and ketamine will be one hell of a trip. I have etizolam and Klonopin just in case the lyrica doesn’t cut it.

Well I took 200mg + of mdma last night. As I was coming down I took 2g of soma. I didn’t really feel the the soma, so I took 600mg of pregabalin. A couple hours later I was still wide awake so I ingested 3 mg of etizolam. The lyrica must have taken a while to work, but once it did I passed out and then woke up 3:00 pm. I’m still feeling the lyrica at this point and I love it.

I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I ingested a large dose of high quality mdma and was pretty disappointed. My eyes were extremely dilated, but there wasn’t much euphoria and empathy present. Instead of being open and talkative I was introverted and quiet. The same thing happens with psychedelics, I tend to get confused and the visuals are lackluster. The best part of my mdma session was when I took lyrica during the comedown.

Nope I haven’t been on antidepressants. I’m not sure if it’s because I’m older now or what. I’ve abused quite a few drugs over the years though I’ve been pretty much clean for the last 4. Perhaps my drug addled brain just doesn’t respond the same anymore. Even adderall doesn’t produce the effects it used to. The only thing that seems to work the same is benzos and lyrica. It sucks.

Well I abused lyrica pretty severely about 4 years ago and I built up a huge tolerance to the point where it didn’t work anymore. I can’t say it works like it used to but it definitely still produces some pleasant effects. MDMA and psychs on the other hand have seemingly lost there magic permanently.

Oh man I was feeling like an absolute wreck this morning. Must have been from the mdma the other night plus the fact that I took somas and benzos to help combat the comedown. I just took 600mg of lyrica to alleviate my discomfort and it worked like a charm.

I had some fun with lyrica the other day for the first time in a good few months. 

Id got a quarter L (12.5g) of ket the night before and my mate offered to do a trade the rest of his lyrica for half a gram of k. He had 11 x 150mg so 1650mg.

Of course i said yes and took the lot at once on an empty stomach (this was around 6am plus id been awake all night drinking and did about 6-7g k already) 


It was a great day. I was stumbling everywhere, dropping stuff in shops, getting twitchy hands like when trying to roll a cig ripping it in half and stuff lol, but doing alot of k which helps with the twitches i find, enough to be able to IV anyway haha. By 6pm i had finished the rest of the k and drank more, took some valium and dph and had a lovely sleep. 


It was my favorite type of time to lyrica, early AM after being up all night drinking and on k, wonky and sleep deprived. Plus it was sunny and warm. 


Good, in fact, great times. I love how well this stuff mixes with k. 1650mg is id say a sweet spot for me, tbf 1500mg would have done nicely. Shame its useless to IV. 


Stay safe kids!

Everything’s changed man. Weed definitely works but it gives me extreme panic attacks now. It didn’t used to be like that, but I can’t smoke bud anymore which sucks because I loved doing so.


I’m not sure if it’s the lyrica, but I just plugged some adderall and I barely feel it. It’s been 8 hours since I took pregabalin, but it lasts for quite some time.

Well I used to be a lyrica a few years ago and abused to the point where it lost it’s efficacy. I just started taking it again and it still works but I’m more prone to the negative side effects. The high can feel somewhat dirty and disorienting at times, but it’s still nice. Not necessarily euphoric. 


I just began using benzos again as well. I take etizolam or Klonopin once a week and it still gets the job done.

If, without any tolerance, I were to take 200mg of pregabalin in the evening for mild recreational effect, would I have any trouble going to sleep when I wanted? (I appreciate that it generally helps with sleeping, but can it do the opposite too?)

Lyrica is probably one the best medications for anxiety I’ve ever encountered. The duration of action and lack of rebound anxiety makes it an ideal substance to combat my overwhelming stress. 600 mg absolutely obliterates my GAD and allows me to function at a higher capacity.  I guess the only downside is that it slightly affects my concentration and memory, but it’s still nowhere near as bad as benzos. I don’t get extreme euphoria or anything, but I definitely feel pleasant.

I used to use a ton of dissociatives 4 years ago, but have been relatively clean the whole time. This class of drugs has always been one of my favorites. I just started using K a month or so ago. At first 150mg would have me flying. I began using it 4 days a week and after the first week there was a mild increase tolerance. Out of no where and seemingly over night my tolerance went through the roof. I did 175mg line and the subsequent effects were quite disappointing. I need 400mg to really get somewhere and it blows.


For me Lyrica seems to inhibit the effects of most drugs with the exception of other downers. Perhaps it’s because I dropped MDMA the night before I tried this combo and my brains depleted on all fronts. After a week break I’ll try it again.

4 years ago I was prescribed lyrica. I was on it for a year or so and when it came time to get off of it I didn’t experience severe withdrawals. Compared to benzos it was a walk in the park. It appears some or more prone to symptoms of lyrica withdrawal. Nonetheless I’ll be careful not to over do it.

Anyone used this with 1,4-butanediol? Just got a half of liter and I’m a bit concerned of keeping my use in check. I’m guessing this combo might be sketchy. I took 600mg about 5 hours ago.


I decided against the combo. I’ve been a little reckless with my soma usage. Between that and my occasional benzo use I’ve been relentlessly hammering my gaba-a receptors. I woke up yesterday in a state of sheer panic. My body was extremely achy and the hypersensitivity was pretty intense.


I took 600 mg of pregabalin and it completely obliterated my symptoms. I’m hoping that since it doesn’t alter gaba levels it won’t end up exacerbating my withdrawals. I just have to be careful not to overdo the lyrica.

With no tolerance, my partner and I each dosed 150mg at ~7PM to test the waters. I had microdosed ALD-52 in the morning and was already pretty tired out even before dosing. At this does by itself, I can say that we both felt something close to being tipsy; in addition, my tiredness was magnified. We both smoked weed and it synergized better than I had expected. We had some great conversations, had some amazing sex, and watched a movie. Overall mild but pleasant effects for a short night.


We both slept well, but had to get up at our regular early time the next morning and both of us had a really hard time getting out of bed. We both still felt pretty sedated and spacey the next morning. This makes me leery of doing a bigger dose if we have any responsibilities the next day (we have kids).


For what it's worth, I decided to microdose again that next morning. I expected blunted effects since I still felt the sedation from the pregabalin but, counter-intuitively, the microdose was actually significantly stronger than usual. This can happen for all sorts of reasons of course. No idea if the pregabalin played a role, but it was surprising.

Hey, long time since i posted


So im prescribed Lyrica since 2/3 months ago. Started on 50mg or 25/25mg per day then up to 100mg or 50/50mg per day. The gp wont prescribe me any higher and i have to wait for Psychiatrist review (Which should be soon)

I weigh nearly 100kg. Im right in thinking for 3 months @ 100mg a day this dose is way too low for me? it was for anxiety , it doesnt have any effect really in that department so far. 


Also I wanted to know of the Safety + Interaction of Pregablin and other drugs such as: Cannabis and Ecstasy

I have been taking Lyrica for a long time and have combined it with many drugs. With cannabis it goes well, there is a synergy between pregabalin and cannabis. And with mdma it felt good, it calmed down the anxiety a bit and it was very euphoric.

Also I have combined it "without the intention of doing it" with ketamine, tramadol, oxycodone, alcohol, nbome and lsd, without problems but we are all different.

Hey all, welcome to my first post.

I'm currently taking some 3-ish mg (sometimes 2 mg, sometimes 5 mg)of clonazolam throughout the day and start to experience now, 3 weeks in, I experience first WD symptoms Also had just switched from an etizolam-diazepam rotation for some weeks, 90 x 10 mg Diazepam, 200 x 1 mg etizolam all original pharma with a one week phenibut break afterwrads.

I was now put on Pregabalin, too by a psychiatrist, just started this week at 2x75 mg per day, which makes me quite sleepy, but I feel the clona has fucked up my day-night rythem already, ever so slightly. I wake up early, don't feel I get enough sleep. The pregabalin doseage will be adjusted in a while to yeald first good results and I'll have a phone call bc of something else with my GP, but will mention the pregabalin, though the psych-doc gave me a 3-weeks supply and told me to up the dose at the end of this instead of after the first week.

So here is my issue: I want to get off the clona asap, as it feels like it's becoming more and more of a problem (higher and higher doses to somewhat function, side effects). So I was wondering about your best advice here? My clona supply is in solution and, considering my dosage, virtually unlimited. Should I try something like a taper or do you think I might get away with just doubling the Lyrica and stopping benzos? Or should I try to substitute with phenibut, of which I still have a small amount in solution. All the benzos have so far only been helpers I just enjoyed my life again, started making conversation, started meeting with people hand talk to them over some coffee... nothing of this would have happened without the benzos. And no neative effects. Till Clone. I'm now really scared after discovering the 100 mg clone/day thread and hope I can make it short and painless, though that might mean waving my newly wone social comptence goodbye. If the kyrice doesn't catch it soon...

I'm also on 60 mg Methadone, but I think this doesn't really matter here.

I hope someone here can help me kick off the clona as soo as possible.


Thank you for your advice in adcance!

Considering how strong clonazolam is your doses aren't actually low and therefore you should definitely taper. A good rule of thumb when tapering down with benzos is to reduce the dose by 25% at the time. Then you should stay on that dose for 2 weeks and then reduce your dose by 25% again. And then repeat until your ready to drop down to zero.


I was advised to do tapering this way by a psychiatrist who i trust and has never disappointed me. I guess some people might need lesser of a dose reduction to be able to stay on the lowered dose but that's at least a good starting point. No reason why you couldn't adjust this protocol to make it feel comfy for you.


Edit: First of all you'll have to find out what is the daily dose that allows you to feel ok and stable. Only after that you can start tapering. Stop alternating your daily dose.

Oh, tht's what I suspected. Many thanks for your hoest reply. Yes, I'm at the moment taking it whenever I start to feel low, don't really know how much I'm on.

I was thinking about waiting tilll I really feel it, get all shaky, can't sleep anymore, feel mpending doom and anxiety and then try something like 0.5 mg.

It could be my imagination, but it seems to kick in quicker when I pour the powder under my tongue and let it dissolve before swallowing (it's bitter, but I kind of enjoy it for some reason).  The capsules dissolve pretty quickly though, so I doubt there's much of a difference between swallowing the powder or swallowing the whole capsule... I generally give it a couple chomps anyway just to get it going if I don't feel like opening it up to get at the powder.

Eek dropping 25%... I'd aim for less if you can supply it, but this is.. bad advice probably.  Chip off 5%... coupla days, chip off another 5%... keep it steady... another 5.  I dunno.

IDK about that. Dropping down 5% every other day sounds worse to me. It's a lot faster rate than 25% dose reduction and staying on it for 2 weeks before the next drop.

Thank's for all he support.


So I need .6 mg twice a day to feel "normal". As my Pregabalin has just been increased, I'll try to trop 25% and see hgow I feel. Hope the Pregabalin can mask or reduce most of the synptoms.

Absolutely. I try to exercise at least every 2nd day.


I didn't expect the cravings to be so horrible, though. I mean: I came off diazepam, etizolam and alprazolam in the past, but had never cravbings like this.

Ok, guys, I slipped up tonight. Took something around 3.5 mg Clona at once (can't say exactly how much, but must have been 3.5-3.8 mg), 225 mg Lyrica (my regular dose is 150 mg twice a day) and prior to all of this about 2 g Phenibut, about 1 our earlier. I feel terrible, in some way, but of course it;s not a problem, all my fears, anxiety and lonelyness is gone. I sometimes think I might be os panicky bc I'm feeling so lonely, don't know. My Psych doc and GP know about my benzo habit and that it would rather help me to get clean pharma benzos at the right dose, but are not willing to prescribe anything in this regard (yet). Lucky enough I got lyrica and am up to my dose so quickly, considering I'm in the south of  UK.

I guess as I have it in my system now, I shoiuld just enjoy the effects and not give so much thought about this mess, but try to be better tomorrow. Tomorrow will come. What do you all think?


Oh, I will be on the phone with my GP tmrw. She appreciates and rather rewards honesty. What should I tell her, you reckon?


Many thanks for yiour greatsupport!  :giggle:

PS: The phenibut was meant to mask my mild benzo-wds, but it was, assume,  the disinhibition of that which lead to the other stuff. NExt time I'll try Promethazine instead.

If the 25% drop seems too steep there's no reason to try a lesser amount.

Don't think it's to steep. I just bthougt the phenibut would helk, but ultimatelty lead to the opposite of what I was hoping it'll do, in the end.

And Why do ytou say that? Maybe 10% with some promethazine might be appropriate for me? Or whart about just cold wd with lyrica only? People slip up. I washoping you'll give me soime more constructive advice here, to be honest ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png) .

(without getting intoxicated) On day 8, you start the taper. 25% is too much for a lot of people. The Pregabalin will help you feel more comfortable. Look up the Ashton Manual.

Ok, so I am now on 1.2 mg twica a day, again. Must say my life cicrumstances aren't great either atm. But neither are they worse. Anyway, I upped m,y dose to 2 x 150 mg officially now and my GP just gave me another script for three weeks at 300 mg per day. I still have my pack of 150 mg per day for 3 weeks. So I've got quite a bit extra. Do you think the extra pregab might help me to get off the benzoes?

the 150 mg arre original lyrica, the other one is some off-brand.


Thanks very much and I appreciate all of your nice and heart warming support.


EDIT: I've got the standard meds, tooo. Like promethazine, scopolamine in low dose for motion sickness (maybe to enhance my methadone during WD (?)) and DXM.

As others have stated, lyrica combines well with just about every substance out there. I just ingested 30mg of adderall and 300mg of lyrica an hour ago and I’m feeling as if I’m in a state of complete zen. They both accentuate the euphoric effects of each other. I’m focused and alert yet calm and collected. Later on I’m thinking of throwing in a couple of somas and see where that gets me. Lyrica is such a versatile little substance.


In a couple of days I’m going to drop a tab or two of lsd and mdma with a low dose of Lyrica to round out the rough edges. I seem extremely prone to bumpy acid come ups lately and this seems to be a great way to alleviate that.

I mean: Saying something about 150 mg, I clearly mean lyrica, not clona ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png) .


So yeah, things are not going as I wished they would atm. I feel I just can't get opver the cravings with my current life... Any other ideas? Would any of the medis I've listed help me ore just make it worse?

Or should I use something like legit Diazepam to get sobar from benzos?


P.S.: Sorry about my last few threads, I was high on Lyrica plus Clona and might have posted some stuff that's hard to read and to understand. Sorry about that. You are a great community and I appreiciate every single positive word or any help, especially as things seem to be getting worse, not better, though I use less clona oer the day.


My GP had the great idea to prescribe me a double dose of lyrica because they thought taking one pill would be more easy than taking two with my old prescritpiopn. So I've got an extra 56 days of lyrica at 300 mg a day I don't need. Tempting.


> Some people have had to reduce Valium intake 2.5-5mg every week because the withdrawals and rebound effects are too much.  Personally I would find a dose that eliminates WD completely for 1 week.  (without getting intoxicated) On day 8, you start the taper.  25% is too much for a lot of people. The Pregabalin will help you feel more comfortable.  Look up the Ashton Manual.

Sounds like a great idea. Might hopefully work. Though I still think I should try to switch over to clonazepam or diazepam.


This all makes me feel like a terrible looser. Why can't I just taper down like everyone elese and like I did before????


Anyway, there is no damping effect from the lyrica regarding my benzo habit, though mood and sleep have clearly increased since I started pregabalin. I callled it a "wonder-drug" a first because it is the only thing that can help me sit still for a prolonged period of time without restless legs. Nothing else, including all kinds of opioidsand antidepressants, could achive this. So long story short: pregabalin seems to help me welll in therapeutic doses and it might be the right drug for me. But I need to get of these nasty benzos.

No point taking the powder out of the capsule, the capsule dissolves pretty quickly so I doubt you'll notice any difference in how quickly it kicks. Much more to do with how empty your stomach is.

Probably sublingual will make it kick faster but with no difference in bioavailability so I don't see much the point as the taste is quite disgusting IMO.

I just ingested 30mg of adderall and 300mg of lyrica an hour ago and I’m feeling as if I’m in a state of complete zen. They both accentuate the euphoric effects of each other. I’m focused and alert yet calm and collected. Later on I’m thinking of throwing in a couple of somas and see where that gets me. Lyrica is such a versatile little substance.

Never tried stimulants with pregabalin, but what you say reminds me of the combination of stimulants and benzos where both of them get rid of the undesired effects of the other. Not a very healthy thing to do though.

Ok, obviously I h gave up for  now. But willl try again , latest date next week and I'll keep you updated. Do You think Etizolam might be of any help what about Pregabalin? What about talking to my contact person at my methadone clinic? Any chance they replace it with  Clonazepam or Diaepam  to collect in ever degreesing doses at my chemist (UK)?

I believe my lyrica usage has gotten a little out of hand. I went through 60 300mg pills in about a month or so. I’m now working through another 60. I started with 600mg a day, but tolerance is starting to manifest itself.


I also just finished 100 somas in a month and am now concerned about withdrawal. I skipped my lyrica for a day and preceded to have terrible nightmares filled with physical pain. I woke feeling depressed and anxious. My muscles felt as if they were on fire and my nerves were fried.


Im currently on 600mg and still have what appears to be withdrawal symptoms so I believe the somas may be the main culprit. I’m about to take another 300mg. Down the rabbit hole we go. I got to get my act together before I return to school.

There is a lot of info on people tapering down from strong benzos.  I notice only a few replies and I hate when someone is trying and is twisting in the wind.  But also I am not experienced to give tapering info but if I needed it I know it exists.  I went two several different methadone clinics.  a few of them private. One was owned by two brothers.  The one a business man and the other the clinic doctor.  If I were honest with that guy he would for sure help me taper down and prescribe me something.  The public or state clinics, not a chance.


I think you are determined palimm and you are not the only one to get in a jam. (We all get ourselves into jams all the time lol).  If it were me I would go slow and easy, stay on a certain amount of meds without increasing and slowly go down.  From what I have read if one goes very slow in a benzo taper it is healthier for mind and body.  And it seems you got the poly drug use going on which pile up.  But I can't see how any of this is a problem if you go slow.

I was on fairly high doses of lyrica for a year or 2 and the withdrawal wasn’t as bad as others report it to be. I was a bit uncomfortable for a week or 2, but that was about it. That was 4 years ago and I notice the more I age the more I’m susceptible to withdrawals and rebound symptoms, so perhaps this may be salient factor.


I have 55 300mg pills left. I’m going to begin to reduce the frequency and amount I consume. I didn’t take any today and will try to keep my usage down to 1-2 times a week.

No, that just means it is a hard capsule opposite to a soft capsule like the ones of Omega 3 and the like.

Not all hard capsules dissolve at the same rate, but I really wouldn't worry about that as I feel it is negligible.

if you use pregablin / lyrica as prescribed, is it less likely to have issues like withdrawel and addiction ?


Lets say for example they put me on 400mg per day and i take only as instructed 

I have a medication review coming up and im not sure where to go ive been on 100mg a day for nearly 3 months now tho

I WILL stop from tomorrrow morning (last dose tonight for sleep), I wait till my body-related symptoms can't be tolerated anymore and will give me my first "mini"-dose then and so on tilll I hopefully, arrive at norhing. Willl ask my GP for something for sleep which should be temazepam, if they know the enemy, but

Your best bet is to find balance and stay at a certain level and lower slowly.  One of the things that stuck with me is people that went too fast coming of benzos had issues with lingering side effects.  Then others that went slow had it better, some even clained it was much easier to go very slow.


Stay well Palimm there is a lot of info here.  Go searching through the threads.  It can be done safely so don't hurt yourself.

As noted, clonazolam at 3mg, let alone 5mg, is actually a high dose, as clonazolam is very strong.  A non-tolerant individual will be high from 0.25mg.  Your best bet is to find the minimum dose that will keep you well, and stay on that dose, VERY strictly, for 2 weeks.  If you slip up and take more, it will set you back even if it's just once.  If you need to go a little higher and feel it a little to avoid slipping up, that would be the best thing.  Clonazolam lasts a long time so if you can manage to dose just once a day, that would make it easier.  If you can do once a day, take it later in the day so you can sleep.  


Once you find a good maintenance dose, stick with it for a couple of weeks, and then drop by 10% (this is the number I see used most often).  Drop 10% every 2 weeks.  It will be a long taper because 10% becomes smaller and smaller the lower you go.  You can't just drop by 10% of the original amount every week because the percentage of the new dose becomes smaller as the dose gets smaller.  Eventually dropping by the same amount will result in 50% reductions, which is going to be hellish.  So it would be like this (let's say 2mg is your starting maintenance dose):


Day 1:  2mg

Day 14: 1.8mg

Day 21: 1.62mg

Day 28:  1.458mg

etc


It will take a while but this is the way you can avoid experiencing withdrawals and eventually get off.  Benzo/gabaergic withdrawals are very dangerous and it causes excitotoxicity, which essentially causes brain damage.  A long, slow taper will result is less lingering side effects.  Oftentimes people who go cold turkey or drop too fast will experience a long period of recovery even after getting past the acute withdrawals.  Slow and steady wins the race when it comes to benzos.

I was prescribed 450mg a day for about a year or so. I then gradually tapered off within a few weeks and didn’t experience much in terms of severe withdrawals. I may have been slightly uncomfortable for 7-10 days, but nothing incapacitating or anything. After subjecting myself to benzo and opiate withdrawals countless times this felt like a walk in the park.  It appears that some are more prone to pregabalin withdrawals than others so keep that in mind.

I have some questions about Lyrica. I used all kinds of shit, but stopped using all kinds of shit 2009. Lyrica became popular around here after that. I have never tried lyrica, not a single time.  I still drink coffee, smoke tobacco and weed, drink beer and there are benzo seasons. I have not had a single benzo for like 2 weeks, regarding that, i am fine. I only used 10  tablets of 10mg temazepam in like 3 days, to help me with my anxiety and insomnia. Doc's prescription. Seems like i am heading to outpatient care in the near future. They should contact me any day now, ER psychiatrist told me so a couple of weeks ago. Maybe i could talk to the doctor there about lyrica option? I am not going to get this stuff from the streets, if i get it, it will be from a pharmacy.


1. Could i replace the occasional benzos with lyrica? (i know everyone is different, but generally speaking) I am not addicted to benzos, but i "cure" hangovers with them sometimes, i might drink if i feel better afterwards and make it to the store and have money. So the benzo is still in my system while i drink beer, not cool.


2. Lyrica combined with a paranormal amount of beer. Dangerous? I mean yeah, a paranormal amount of beer and chain smoking is dangerous in itself, but will it fuck me up big time?


3. Have i understood this correctly, Lyrica is a little bit like benzodiazepines but not so addictive and not so harmful to the user? Not looking for "kicks" of any kind, unless you count being able to sleep and no anxiety "kicks". I do.


I could google all of these questions, but there are real wizards here who know, and who offer help, regarding harm reduction. I trust them more than "trusted sources" of google.

[@Ghost fart](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/547475/) i can only tell you from my experience cause i've just started taking pregabalin instead of benzo/tramadol and after one capsule 100mg i feel like being slightly drunk but controlling everything. It's not causing me a problems in daily life.

Okay. Thank you for the reply. I am pleased to read that you are doing well with pregabalin. I have to study this thread more. Tons of pages ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Many thanks for your input. Well 3-5 mg would be maxima over the whole day on extreme days.


I meanwhile replaced it with Etizolam 3 times a day, 3 mg. I know, still a lot, but I'm going down from here.


EDIT: I also use some lyrica at night for sleep and sometimes for egneral relaxation. Have to be careful here not to swap addictions.

I have never tried lyrica, not a single time.  I still drink coffee, smoke tobacco and weed, drink beer and there are benzo seasons. I have not had a single benzo for like 2 weeks, regarding that, i am fine. I only used 10  tablets of 10mg temazepam in like 3 days, to help me with my anxiety and insomnia. Doc's prescription. Seems like i am heading to outpatient care in the near future. They should contact me any day now, ER psychiatrist told me so a couple of weeks ago. Maybe i could talk to the doctor there about lyrica option? I am not going to get this stuff from the streets, if i get it, it will be from a pharmacy.

(i know everyone is different, but generally speaking) I am not addicted to benzos, but i "cure" hangovers with them sometimes, i might drink if i feel better afterwards and make it to the store and have money. So the benzo is still in my system while i drink beer, not cool.

2. Not necessarily dangerous but a really bad mix as alcohol seems to block pregabalin effects for me. Not only that, even if they say pregabalin is not a gabaergic it is for me. I don't recover from pregabalin physical dependence until I stay free from alcohol and benzos for some weeks. The minimum intake of any of those brings back some of the stomach upset, smelly farts, running nose and depressive thinking which is the pregabalin withdrawal profile for me.

3. I would say that in terms of anxiety. If you are not looking for kicks and just use it occasionally in low doses to fight anxiety and insomnia. In any case, pregabalin is much inferior to benzos in the insomnia department, especially in low doses.

OK atm I seem just to be fucking up. I gave me Clonazolam IV 2 times  this Day (really nice, kicks in fast, unlike alpra. Don't try at home!). And now, welll, I hope I can go back to my Etizolam as needed or should I just try to get help at my regular clinic do be tapered slowly with clonazepam I(don't know if they do)?

If you ask me Clonazolam has NOTHING  in commmon with Clonazepam, though peoopple keep claiming that. It really is a much stronger and more sedating version of Xanax... I think I should try a proper Etizolam taper one last time and then open up to my worker and kindly ask for clonazolam for a smoooth taper. You see: I can atm have nothing that kicks me out of my job or would leave me on sick pay. One week sick pay = not affording rent for me.

No, even if you look all the data available, clonazolam is some super--cersion of alprazolam. ie slightly faster onset, similar pharmacokinetics and -dynamics and action. Its just more sedative due to the chlorine, as far as I understand, But I'm not a cooker or a chemist... I'm just a poor guy with as habit wanting to get off plus its metabolites seem to be super potemnt and long-lasting.


So tyhe plan: Try eti. Not a nice shot of eti in my morning  coffee (which I really love, btw), but only when I really can't function otherwise. I have promethazine and low-dose pregabalin to sleep to.

If this shouold fail its no final: off to the doc.

It's cool that you're enjoying the stuff you're taking. Though your original plan was to taper and get off benzos completely. Now you're going to the opposite direction. Especially IV use will undeniably deepen your addiction.

1.  I am prescribed lyrica for pain caused by nerve damage in my knee--it is effective for this purpose--but I find myself taking it more often as an anxiolytic.  It seems to have myriad psychoactive effects, but one of the strangest things about it is that it seems, somehow, to be capable of acting as an upper and a downer at the same time.

2.  Lyrica and a beer or two mix very well.  Lyrica and a 'paranormal' amount of beer... you'll probably fall down the stairs.  One of the side effects of Lyrica (in recreational doses anyway) is vertigo.  I can attest that alcohol does intensify this effect.

3.  Lyrica is not necessarily 'less harmful' or 'less addictive' than your average benzo.  I think both are great in moderation and potentially disastrous in severe excess.  The addictive potential for pregabalin, like benzos, obviously varies from one individual to the next so keep that in mind.  I think I've noticed more of a mental dependency on pregabalin than a physical one (though I've never gone for more than 6 or 7 weeks without taking a break).  Whenever I do take a break from it I do crave it, but I've never gotten physically ill like I used to with opiates.  I take benzos (xanax) occasionally, but I simply don't think I've ever liked it enough for it to get its hooks in.  As far as insomnia goes, benzos are definitely more effective... though I do tend to get pretty regular sleep while I'm taking pregabalin (much better sleep than I get if I take nothing at all, anyway).  Strangely, it seems like I have a tendency to wake up like clockwork after around 6 hours when I take Lyrica, whereas I might be able to sleep 9 or 10 if I go to bed with a xanax.  Some might even find that preferable, but I find it a bit irritating sometimes.

The effects are similar, but I definitely like Lyrica better.  They are similar enough that a dabbler might even get them confused in a 'blind taste test' (or at least similar enough that it's difficult to describe the difference), but for me, gabapentin seems to have more side effects in recreational doses.  I'm not generally bothered by the brain static and vertigo (it's part of the experience) but somehow gabapentin just feels a little bit 'dirtier'.

Lyrica gives me anxiety and that's it. It does the opposite of a benzo . 

I'm surprised/jealous so many get high from them.

it does kinda suck when someone describes a sought after experience and we try it and are dissapointed. kinda like seeing the look on someones face riding a roller coaster and thinking 'i need that'. we get on and instantly realize that its a kids ride and we dont fit.

 we need standardized global effects from our substances.

I was told gaba is stronger than lyrica, but the first one only calms my nerve pains and sort of stops anxiety while the other kinda fucks me up, i knock things off the table and run into walls and stuff, until im super dizzy and even fall asleep. So when im feeling worse than usual i take lyrica, otherwise i just take gaba. Idk really...

Yeah I take them daily for sleep but they lose there effect after about a week so then I take zopiclone 7.5mg and that doesn't put me to sleep. Maybe if I take another 7.5mg I'll get some sleep.


Yeah maybe I was just imagining things about it getting smaller I did notice less libido.

Hey boys,


Yeah I know another thread about Pregabalin and stuff but here Gabapentin is not that cheap so I want to really know which one is better? 


I have read somewhat mixed opinions: some prefer Gabapentin and others do not change its Pregabalin?  Which is better in your experience?  The issue of tolerance with Pregabalin (so fast) is so severe with Gabapentin?  Is withdrawal that severe?Euphoria wise which one is better?


Blessings My Friends!!

Hey man!


As you know, I'm on gabapentin here. I've never tried pregablin before unfortunately.


I will say tho, that gabapentin tolerance raises pretty damn fast. And I had withdrawals after only 4 weeks of taking them daily. The withdrawals consisted of severe body pain (or maybe this was the body pain I had before I started taking gabapentin and just didn't realize how much pain I was actually in until I stopped taking them again). The pain is very similar to the achey body feel of opioid withdrawal. The mental aspect sucked. Everything felt very boring. Although it was not the same excruciating "cry your eyes out" type of pain/bored that opioid or heroin withdrawals can bring, but it was bad enough to immediately make every day feel shitty.


I also had hallucinations, like seeing trails, colorful blobs, dark spiders running around, etc.. I've never had this issue before until I went through gabapentin withdrawals. I'm guessing that gaba B withdrawals could produce delirium or hallucinations.


The withdrawals lasted for about 5 days. By day 5 I was okay but I ended up taking them again anyway. So I'd say tramadol withdrawal was still worse than gabapentin withdrawal, but it was close. The pain & bored & mental depression felt... different, than those same things you get from other withdrawals. Not sure how to explain it because it's a subjective experience. I'd imagine gabapentin or lyrica withdrawals could be pretty brutal if you're on them long enough.

Just about everyone here prefers pregabalin over gabapentin due to the strength and that you don't need to stagger it.  It is stronger for sure.  Someone like me gets side effects from pregabalin, head shocks and a form of dizziness that scares me over 300 mgs.  Pregabalin seems to effect my head stronger.  But I do take gabapentin and have utilized that one better. That one takes longer to hit but I feel it deep down in my body as opposed to a strong head high.  The head aspect of gabepentin is much genter and has a subtle euphoria that pregabalin does not have for me. So I stuck with that instead of switching.  I also have some generic pregabalin from Canada that I just save and test once in a while.


I get a very light dose for nerve pain.  But not daily. I do not want to get addicted and I do not think I even come close.  I mean 2400-2700 mgs once a week (sometimes twice) has not produced any dependence and I have never been addicted to any gaba drug so I would not know.  I have not had sciatica since doing that routine so whatever it does it is working at that level.


I do see people recommend gabapenitn for pregabalin withdrawal.  But I thougt since they are similar it would keep the dependence going but it seems easer to stop for some people.  I have seen a lot of credible people on here say they took 600 mgs of pregabalin or 2400 mgs of gabapentin daily for 2 years and quit with no withdrawal.  Then I have seen others say after only a month daily they had withdrawal  And I will swear without proof that people also taking benzos have a different dependency that arises than just the pregabalin and benzo alone.  After all I read the people that had the hardest time coming off also were on benzos.

I have to say I have read every staggering post here too. lol  I do think metabolism factors in. I have tried 150 mgs every 40 minutes but it was not as strong as taking 600 mgs every 40 minutes.  I tried 300 mgs but that did not end up as strong either.  So I settled in 600 mgs ever 40-45 minutes.  I have a fast metabolism have been the same weight for 25 years. But I want to try 150 mgs every 45 minutes again and see. I don't want to waste any.

Take 1500 mg of pregabalin at evening, 2 mg of alprazolam, 20 mg of diazepam and 800 mg of tramadol at night yesterday. Fuck. It was too much, I couldn't even speak and I was conscious I think for an hour and then I blackout. But while it lasted I enjoyed it very much. But it is definitely not recommended and I would not do it again.

I feel infinitely lonely, though. Waiting for my diclazepam which takes a while bc of the planet ban in uk, but stuff gets through it I are smart about it. Hope I'll be able to migrate and my lyricsa might help, too. I'm not really ready as you pointed out currectly, but which me luck. It won't be a farewell to benzos, this I can assure nevertheless.


Edit: LivingonValium: you have no idea.what your.support means.to me. Thank you so much for alll your lines!

I tried pregabalin recreationaly, first at 200mg, then 300mg, and then 450mg (with at least 2-3 weeks in between doses).


Finally my assessment is that, for me at least, this drug is only mildly recreational. Notes:


- All trials were taken in the evening and mixed with weed.
- Good: I had a good/fun/lazy night for each of these trials.
- Annoying: I was less articulate on this drug. At 450mg I kept losing my train of thought when trying to explain something.
- Good: When it was time to sleep, I slept easily and slept well.
- Bad: The next morning I was still having trouble with coordination and was sedated.
- Good: The next day had noticeable anti-anxiety effects.
All in all a very tame drug. If I did it again I'd stick with ~300mg or less, since 450 was too much for me (i.e. more sedating with no benefit), however I probably won't bother.

Just found out that Pregabalin won’t be available on prescription in NI (UK) soon but don’t know exactly when. Apparently GP’s are contacting patients soon who are on to get them onto an alternative med.


I take it for GAD and sleep issues - are there any alternatives that provide the same relief?

gabapentin is very similar, but less potent and more difficult to dose (you can't take your dose all at once, it's even often prescribed in a way that makes it not absorb well, it needs to be taken at 300mg every 30-45 minutes, with food in the stomach, as it is an unusual drug that is absorbed via an amino acid transporter in the small intestine).  But it has the same mechanism of action, the effects are less powerful but quite similar.  it is less intoxicating and less addictive, though still produces withdrawals.  It fully substitutes for pregabalin and vice versa, so you won't have to withdraw from pregabalin.  I am nearly certain that is what they will switch you to as it is the closest drug and the only one that will fully substitute without issues, and it is considered safer and less prone to abuse.

If ya in the US it is Rx only these days. The "lock-down" on pregab is popularly tied to the following perspective:

Anything goes good with pregab imo/e; thought the same with gabapentin but to anotha leva fo sho. lol

And a hells yeah to weed and pregab. Nothing better than taking a few puffs on some good weed a few hours afer the pregab starts kickin in. Just amazing to me. Need someone to splice genes from the two and come up with some preg-anja or summin.

UK has always had a time with this chemical for some reason... I thought it used to be super expensive in the US (when it was lyrica and no generics) until I saw what they were paying. Cant remember the numbers but outlandish.

In the US it is scheduled.  My doc would have switched me from gabapentin to pregabalin but I wanted to stick with gabapentin.  I get weird head twitches on pregablin over a certain amount. I also feel like I am going to lose consciousness. Goes right to my head. Gabapentin has a deep down body feeling for me.  Relaxes me.

yeah I get that too, at high doses.  I even fell down once.  it's kind of alarming, but I rarely take it so I don't need to dose that high to get the effect I desire.  I love pregabalin, the first time I ever took it, I had one of the best and most pleasurable highs of my entire life, it was insane, like a strong opiate combined with GHB and something weed-like (in that it was pretty trippy).  It is hands down the best thing to help against opiate withdrawal, too.  Gabapentin is quite similar but just a lot less intense... gabapentin is more functional and smoother.  Pregabalin is quite intoxicating at sufficient dosage but gabapentin remains pretty functional even at higher doses.

Hahaha ![😂](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f602.png) I'm sure it was because of my intoxication face (tramadol, alprazolam, diazepam, codeine, tapentadol plus I ate nothing) and red eyes.


Anyway man, I've always wanted to try Gabapentin, even though the staggered doses sound like a real pain in the ass, but I'm used to doing it with tramadol by now.


And about the myoclonic jerks, they are scary, especially if you took it with tramadol. It's like a disaster waiting for it to happen.

I understand the myoclonic jerks.  I get that sometimes with gabapentin.  But with pregabalin it seems more sinister and shocks my head in a way that scares me.  I think I just may get these side effects.


I do have pregabalin around too.  I have to say as long as gabapentin works for me I am all about keeping tolerance low.  Gabapentin can get rid of about 90% of kratom withdrawal for like a whole day or two so for now it does me good.

Well when I do gabapentin I do have a lot of food available. I make it my treat day so as I stagger it I eat too and even get a large Coca Cola to chase it.  Both gabapentin and pregabalin make me hungry but not in a benzo way.  With benzos I can wake up the next day and realize I stuffed my face and fell asleep but not remember.  ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) But I am aware I eat when i have gabapentin or pregabalin. It does not kill my memory like a benzo.  Much gentler.

I don't mind the delay i get for finishing on Pregabalin, it's obtainable unlike with Opioids for me. Haven't had Benzos in time though.

Never during my junkie time did I feel that I needed benzos or gabapentinoids to potentiate my high. Apparently, either I was getting good shit, or junkies these days throw harm reduction right out the window and make stoopid choices to take other heavy duty CNS depressants on top of heroin (let’s be honest, it’s dangerous fentanyl now), and decide that they want to potentiate their nod by adding benzos or gabapentinoids. Then your friends get that nod they are looking for and never wake up. I’m sorry dude but fuck them. This is a harm reduction site, and if people are too stupid to not do their own research about what will kill them getting loaded, they don’t deserve to do drugs, and in your friends case do anything else either.

Fuck my friends? Wow classy! 

They where all prescribed pregabs by there doctors who knew they had heroin addictions so it was never about adding anything to increase the affect of the gear. Also most of the addicts I know dont have computers let alone internet access so sites such as this only reach so far.

Pregbalin/gabapentin shouldn’t be prescribed for nerve pain now when there are other more appropriate meds.


Northern Ireland is FLOODED with pregabalin and yes it has contributed to lots of deaths. It’s indicated on a lot of autopsy reports. The kids mix it with whatever else they are taking and don’t realise how potent it is when mixed with benzos/alcohol/tramadol and whatever other prescription meds they are taking.

Pharmaceutical are out to make money.  In the US there are commercials for Lyrica 10 times a day telling people to "ask your doctor" about it.


So this does surprise me,. I can't really make logical sense of it yet.

Yeah, the reps in the north were out in force, it’s why it was handed out like smarties. Absolute joke, there were many ignored recommendations to stop prescribing going back years. ![🤷🏼‍♀️](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f937-1f3fc-2640.png)

Pregabalin is not meant to be taken in conjunction with fucking heroin (fentanyl, let’s be honest). For Christ sakes, I have zero empathy for doctors that completely disregard all aspects of harm reduction and give these junkies a drug that is deadly when it is used in conjunction with their drug of choice.

Bro 99% of harm reduction is having access to the unadulterated drugs you seek. Doctors prescribing gabapentin OR ANY DRUG EVER is not against harm reduction. Gabapentin does help with opioid wd. I used it to quit kratom. I have also quit IV heroin, IV Meth, IV coke and smoking crack etc etc etc. Mostly by harm reduction. and let me tell you... Harm reduction is not what your young mind thinks it is at all. It's not blaming doctors and perpetuating the war on Drugs or interfering and limiting ones supply. It's 99% about having access to the drugs you seek and not being poisoned by unknown ingredients. It certainly has little or nothing to do with regulation of drugs. You my friend are the harm reduction idiot. Sorry for anyone who has to deal with you

ah yes "buds"  another one of my ex-addicitions.


About 5 years ago when I was a addicted to 1200mg a day it was so easy to get prescribed 2 boxes of 300mg and get them put on repeat too.


didn't have that much trouble getting off them though, tapered quite easy with zero effects really, unlike bupe which I am struggling with................

What's wrong with this drug? I tapered from taking 450 mg/day to taking 150 mg/day for anxiety, and I can't really tell a difference in my well-being. Now I tried what would happen if I would take a single dose of 225 mg. Nothing! There really seems to be a terrible tolerance to the effects of this drug. Maybe I should stop taking it at all for a while and then try again?

Daily use makes it so you can't feel a thing in terms of a high/euphoria with gabapentinoids.  Even 2 days in a row and I need like 3 times the dose to feel the same effect the second day.  So I will only take gabapentinoids once every few days, I leave at least 2 full days between doses and I can experience the full effect every time.


If you've been taking it daily for a while, you probably will have withdrawals if you stop suddenly.

I take it every day as migraine prevention for nerve damage in my neck (and anxiety and sleep purposes) and the only thing that stays the same is its ability to make me feel drowsy at the end of my staggering. Every once in a wihle, for some reason, I'll feel it pretty pronounced in the evening hours. I'll think "damn I feel kind of fucked up and wobbly". It's a strange one just like phenibut. I'd be lying if I said I didn't completely miss how it was when I started but taking days off isn't really an option for me as I take 2400mg/day.


It is a godsend for keeping my neck injury-caused migraines away though. In fact, it's about the only thing that works.


Edit: Forgot this was a pregabalin thread, was speaking on gabapentin. I definitely do not take 2400mg of Lyrica a day... ![:LOL:](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f606.png)

Recently I've been experimenting with pregabalin and phenibut. I'm trying to determine exactly what subjectively distinguishes the two drugs, and how they work in combination with each other. One interesting thing that I've noticed is that pregabalin pushes me towards hypomania. If I take it with phenibut, for some reason the phenibut militates against the hypomania, but it might augment the anxiolytic effects of pregabalin. Anyone have any experiences with this?

I only have experience with gabapentin and phenibut but I too notice more hypomania with gaba but phenibut has some too.  It’s been so long since I had gaba that I should give it a go again.

Na unfortunately not.  I both often use them as adjunct drugs to mix with other more dominant substances, like alcohol, stimulants, MDMA, etc.

Interesting.. I have been planning to use it with MDMA but I am afraid that it will mute the experience. I have taken GBL with MDMA, and it works with the raw euphoria, but it subdues the 'magic'. I don't like to waste MDMA experiences since I limit myself to 4 times per year

Adding phenibut to pregabalin just made it feel dirtier in my experience. Personally i enjoyed the hypomania from pregabalin

Nah, just gabapentin. I would love to switch to pregabalin though. It costs exactly the same through my health insurance.

I used to know this lady when name brand Lyrica was first hitting the big time and she would give me her entire script for 20 bucks because she thought I was nice and I offered her help when she would come into my work. I was amazed by how fucking floored I got from it lol

This sure is a weird drug, love the pain relieving, anxiolytic and hypnotic effects but hate how much it scrambles my brain and how wobbly it makes me. was trying to write as i felt compelled to from its other nice effects. Handwritig was fucked! The next day I was up early and had penty of hours to get ready for work. Time distorted and I was nearly late, a few hours felt like 20 mins.. 


Also not liking the research I read about it destroying neural pathways in some way, makes sense, I feel chemically retarded on this, more than benzos or phenibut. I also only need about 75mg for decent effects but have tried 650mg once, always wise to start low as it hits me way harder than most people describe on here and other forums.


Im only using this very infrequently to help taper off subs and benzos, it s helpful for that but i'm kind of glad I don't enjoy a lot of its effects, less addictive for me.

One side effect I've always hated that has also never completely gone away with full tolerance (gabapentin and pregabalin) is their ability to make me forget what i'm about to say as I'm about to say it. That can be very frustrating when you constantly forget shit and have it on the tip of your tongue. It's better now but still happens from time to time where I'll just sort of blank out. Kind of fucked.

I've actually been transitioning to a lower dosage due to running low and using... let's call them Eastern versions of Neurontin and it has been essentially unnoticeable. (2400mg to 1800mg to 1600mg to around 1200mg). I receive my normal script from a psychiatrist who gave them to me for fragmented sleep issues due to erratic work schedule (plus he knows about my neck and how I used to take it in high doses) and, ironically, as I lowered my dose my problems waking up every hour or two during the night have all but disappeared. Last 3 days I've only woke up a total of twice in the night. Probably gonna just stick on a lower dose and hoard the extras.

I take ONE 150 MG of oregabalin daily and get a high for a few hours after it kicks in which takes a couple hours, after the initial high (makes me feel stoned but with lots of energy) I get sleepy and if I take just a 30min nap I wake up feeling no drowsiness or anything as if I hadn’t taken it. You’re taking a LOT of pregabalin. I’ve been on it for over a year and one pill a day still gets me a nice little buzz and it says if I just started taking it I haven’t built a tolerance or anything to it to where I need more than one a day whatsoever. It’s not like gabapentin where you need three or 400 mg Steven file. One 150 mg capsule should do you just fine.

I find that one 150 mg capsule of pregabalin gives me a nice buzz every time and I take one a day and have it for over a year. If I take gabapentin I need about 3 to 400 mg to even feel it. It’s much weaker than pregabalin.

Gabapentin is mostly not used by the body and I think the highest one could expect from it is 30-40% (and that is with eating with fats and using other otc to help absorption) and piss the rest out. A waste of space and time, imo.

How about calibrating the doses in a way that reduces the sedative effect. Perhaps 300mg pregabalin and 1 gram of phenibut

oh i will dose 1.5g phen and pop a coupla three hundred mg of pregab but there is a weird timing thing with these two that has changed after a few years that I just hope they (peak) at the same time it got thrown off somehow. Like phenibut hcl: Used to hit in five hours like clockwork. Now it is 8-10. The other day I dosed and started feeling it in about an hour. 

Pregab takes about three to four hours to start peaking so ya see where I was? I did was on purpose... i just said fuck it just dose as usual and whatever. weird.

kratom is about to be out of the equation as i am out and have dropped from 12-15g a day to like 5g a day scattered throughout. hasnt been to rough have to admit. barely notice. be out in maybe another day but not scared been through some rough shit, right? lol

Anyone ever taken a high dose but using the low dosed capsules?

I've just got 67 x 25mg capsules, thats 1675mg which is an ideal if anything liiittle high dose for me, my sweet spots around 1400mg id say.

I'd like to take 1400mg so thats a LOT of capsules to swallow. Is there anything that i should be concerned about swallowing that amount of - whatever the capsule is made from-? Talking 56 capsules here lol.

It'll be on an empty stomach.

Thanks!

Oh yeah and they're all expired from 2019/2020 if that makes a difference to the capsules? I know it wont to the chemical itself, they've been stored well and are still in blisters.

Honestly I would dump out the content of capsules and either parachute or mix with water and down it.

You should be fine swallowing that amount of capsules, but I would also personally dump the contents out and swallow.  That's just me though, you won't hurt yourself consuming it, it's just gelatin.

Cheers peeps. 

I did think about emptying them into a drink but then remembered how the mixture went when i tried to IV the contents of 2 x 150mg capsules in 2.5mg water (didnt really dissolve into solution even with heat), plus couldn't be bothered to open up and empty that many capsules, it was annoying enough just popping them out of the blisters lol so ended up just eating them. It was fine ![👍](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f44d.png)

yo i finally got my refill on this. pharmacy gives me three months at a time, which is actually a pain. my dose was recently raised to 150mg/day. of course that's not how i take it. 


i get a visual effect from this. maybe because i am also on an ssri. brighter colors. empty space looks more significant.

Just got my lyrica the other day. It’s been great to have around to quell my anxiety and general pain. It’s one of the only substances I can use without running into issues of dependency. . Not sure why, but even after using it extensively for a month or two I don’t get agonizing withdrawals. Perhaps I’m uncomfortable for a few days, but that’s about it. Now if I use benzos for 2-3 days in a row my next week or two are wrecked with rebound anxiety and depression. I try not to use

It too frequently as it does reduce my cognitive abilities.


I ingested 150mg of lyrica and 45mg of adderall roughly 5 hours ago followed by 450mg 2 hours ago. When amphetamines are used in conjunction with lyrica all of its rough edges are smoothed out. It feels vaguely similar to the bursts of energy I get with ghb though more drawn out and subtle. These amphetamines have me bouncing around various threads on here like a pinball machine.

^Does it really work with such high doses? I've tried taking double the usual dose, with no significant effect. Haven't taken more than that, though.

> I would say 300mg would be a good starting dose for someone not tolerant to GABAergics. Also, this isn't an anti-depressant, you don't need to wait a long period of time to feel its effects. We're talking about recreational drugs, lyrica takes a long time to kick in and that is 1-1.5hours oral. I have a mild GABA tolerance and find 900-1200mg a good dose but have taken 2400mg before and had fun so I wouldn't say you are at risk of ODing and having a bad time. In any case you sound like you would really benefit from some drug/lyrica education so read the lyrica/pregabalin megathread and whatever you can on here. The only real negative side effect I have experienced when you are at the 1000mg plus range is joint pain.

> 
> I would think 450 would be recreational for someone like you with 300 being conservative but hey if 300 or 225 (I gather you have 75mg tabs) even works for you then great. The problem with starting low is that the half life is 5-6 hours and it takes a while to kick in so by the time you wait and don't feel much then wait for it to kick in your system has eliminated a decent amount, so start somewhere reasonable. Definitely don't start below 200 and feel free to go up to 600.

That was after I had been into GHB, Benzo's an Kratom.  Had even tried Phenibut. So not that that say's anything about another individual. As i took the next cap when the first kicked in. As it takes 1.5 to 2  hours to take effect ime.

Damn, even after a 2 month break tolerance seems to still be there a little bit. Though It may be due to the fact that I take 600-900mg of gabapentin daily. I get the 300mg pills so It’s easy to over do it. I need about 450-600mg to really experience it’s effects.


I work at a crisis stabilization unit that treats the mentally ill a couple days a week. Needless to say this job can be extremely stressful as many patients are prone to fits of violence induced by delusions. Lyrica has been very helpful in dealing with such an environment. I already have issues with incapacitating anxiety, so I’m glad I have these around to alleviate those dysfunctional symptoms.


I don’t know how Ken Kesey dropped acid at a psych ward. From what I’ve experienced  here there is no way I could endure such an event and maintain my sanity.

Ugh I really don’t like how lyrica interferes with cognition. Long term memory doesn’t seem to be effected all that much, but my short term memory is severely compromised. Just now I opened my backpack to retrieve something and then totally forgot what I was looking for. Earlier I walked into a room and couldnt remember why. Definitely not the best substance to use all the time while attending school. For this reason I try to limit my usage to twice a week. Otherwise it’s a great tool to have around.

Pregabalin is reasonable for treating neuropathic pain (I get prescribed 450mg a day, for phantom limb pain), but when it flares up, the only thing that works is an NMDA antagonist (eg ketamine). My wife has a friend who has diabetes induced peripheral neuropathy, who was getting frankly ridiculous amounts of oramorph (120mg of morphine a day), and it didn't work that well (the only opiates that work are those with some NMDA antagonism eg dihydrocodeine, tramadol, oxycodone or methadone. There are others that work, but that's all you can get on the NHS).

Try using cannabis (orally, to avoid being obvious from the smell) and 4-FMPH, while actually a patient on a psyche ward. Then again, for the few weeks I was in there, I mostly just kept to my room, either reading or watching videos, on my laptop, mostly only going out for meals, walks outside (wasn't sectioned), or occasional times I had to talk to psychiatrists (since then, I mostly have no time for the self opinionated, experts in absolutely everything, even if they'd just been questioned about things 10 mins earlier. Except for one, arseholes who seemed to have more psychological problems than most of their patients). Best thing was someone I made friends with, who had a Ph.D. in psychology, who hated psychiatrists (he was bipolar, but when on form, was funny as fuck), who had copies of letters he'd written to various psychiatrists, including one of the funnest things I've ever seen - a photoshopped picture of the picture on the box of 'Connect 4', with a line underneath, "Connect 1, a game for psychiatrists everywhere". Reduced me to uncontrollable laughter, for a good 15-20 mins. Was certain my room was going to get searched, but it's amazing how many people are so uncomfortable asking me to take my prosthetic limb off, for examination... ![🤣](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f923.png)

It appears I may be experiencing benzo withdrawal. At first I thought it was just rebound symptoms, but I think taking etizolam 1-2 times a week has finally caught up with me. It's been 3 days and my whole body is aching unbearably. I also have this fever, my anxiety is through the roof, and my cognition is severely impaired. I thought I wouldn't be at risk if I limited my use to once or twice a week, but alas here we are.


I was trying to get through the day without consuming anything, but I have an organic chem exam coming up so I felt compelled to take the edge off. 300 mg down the hatch and 2 hours later most of my symptoms have been reduced minus the cognition as lyrica seems to make that worse. Not great for studying, but at least I don't feel like hanging myself.

Made it two weeks without etizolam. Felt terrible up until day 13. It definitely wasn't full blown withdrawal, but I was suffering quite a bit. Lyrica is a godsend for alleviating issues associated with benzo discontinuation. It didn't resolve all discomfort, but it helped a lot with anxiety. 


The only drawback with lyrica is it's insanely long onset. I don't really feel anything until roughly 2 hours goes by. At least it's overall duration is extremely long. 


A few hours ago I took 60mg of amphetamines, 600mg of lyrica, and treated myself to 1mg of etizolam. Absolutely love this combo. Pure bliss.

How much etizolam were you taking on those 1-2 days a week, if you don't mind? 


I'm curious because I gave up benzos as a drug of addiction years ago but came back to them eventually, with a more pragmatic attitude this time. But I've still have had periods when I used them up to 3x in a week for several weeks in a row and it never seemed to bring back W/Ds, not even when skipping them for a couple of weeks. However, my dosing was usually pretty low (like 0.3-0.5mg etizolam or equivalent).


I also concur whole-heartedly on the 60mg amphet + 600mg pregab combo + 1mg etiz for 8h later.

I have a similar situation. From age 18-26 I had an atrocious benzo problem. Going through grams of etizolam and other benzos at an extremely high rate. Hell I was even IV'ng etizolam dissolved in propylene glycol. Wreckless behavior that I'm still paying for. I've had countless seizures and I feel like I'll never be quite right as if I caused irreparable damage. 


Fast forward a bit. I'm now 31 years old and after about a 4 years of abstaining from benzos I started cautiously using them again. For the past year I've been taking 2-3 mg of etiz usually 1-2 times a week. There have been some weeks where I'll do it 3 times, but rarely. The days in between using etiz started to become more difficult as time went on. 2-3 days after a dose I notice I'm extremely anxious and agitated. My body aches and I have trouble concentrating. And the nightmares... oh man they are absolutely horrid. Vivid and lucid projections of all my fears and insecurities accompanied by sleep paralysis. 


I truly believe my past benzo abuse permanently altered my brain chemistry which makes occasional usage difficult to do without experiencing intense rebound symptoms.


I wish I didn't love this god damn class of drugs. They just work so well. Insidious little fuckers.

Oh boy, I just unnecessarily plugged another 20mg of adderall and it's 8:40pm. Perhaps I overdid it. My heart rate is quite high. Amphetamines destroy my ability to contain my compulsive behaviors. May not get any rest tonight but I know the lyrica and etiz will help.


Maybe it's because your doses are pretty low. Did you often give yourself 2 week breaks? I think that's crucial if you want to avoid benzo withdrawal or rebound. This was probably the first 2 week break I had in a year and it was pretty rough. From now on I have to reduce my intake down to once maybe twice every two weeks.

I seen this coming but what I find just as if not more scary is the fact that benzo dependant people are simply refused a script to taper off and are left to source their own BM benzos. I pushed my GP and local addicion clinic about this and no one will budge, same thing with others I know who are unfortunately in the same predicament. Im told to taper off slowly yet thats not possible if supply is all over the place with tons of fake benzos around. They have blood on their hands, as more and more people are stuck in this predicament leading to suicide, siezures or overdoses.

This will just increase the internet trade of drug sales from dubious (mostly) sources.

Banning a substance usually just has the opposite effect and causes more deaths.

Yee! Just got 60 300mg in the mail. Took a 3 week break so my tolerance should be relatively low. Initially I was concerned that my avid consumption, over the span of a few months or so, would lead to some withdrawal symptoms. For whatever reason abrupt discontinuation of Lyrica doesn’t leave me in a state of unbearable withdrawal. I may feel a little irritable or achy for a week, but nothing debilitating.


I’ve been trying to limit my benzo usage to twice a week, but even so I still experience rebound anxiety and other nasty effects in between my off days. Lyrica has been a perfect tool to mitigate these effects and doesn’t prolong or exacerbate benzo withdrawal.


I’m so glad to have these little guys in my arsenal. It’s the one thing I’ve been able to use without negatively effecting my life.

Hi dear lighters this will sound confusing but I'm dealing twice a month explaining this and it's manipulating which makes me hating myself and frustrating that pregabs are not only for my anxiety, pain,( 2 surgeries). It's addictive and hard to maintain( Rivotril-klonazepam was great but I'm somehow allergic)

I do not fear anything as this f...substance, as my familly doc is old and she's been helpfull in matter of thing that as I ran out earlier she was prescribeing me more cause Pregabs was tool that kicked benzos out. And that was on like for a year and now she just don't or wont understand that is addictive as hell, atleast I tried to say to make plan to taper to stable dose but then she prescribe me xanax or lorazepam to not feel wd symptoms. My psych which gave me termin in like a week and she prescribed me 750mg daily dose cause my benzo wd and that is higher than HDD., she understands. And psych is like big boss and we get allong as I'm clean every month

I dont drink alcohol only smoke cigs last 3 years.

I'm on 2mg bupe maintenance( tramadol, morphin, bupe)

750mg pregabalin

Lorazepam as needed.

I have some Concerta which helps me with fatigue and to focus but is on special presc. Which means it's expensive but I have it. Legally

The only thing what bothers me,

Why am I feeling scared and frustrated when I have couple pills of pregabs. I have 600mg Lyrica left for couple days, have a new job interview.

Obviously I have Xanax and Lorsilan( lorazepam), subutex, Concerta

Is it possiblle that Lyrica makes me miserable even near all those meds? Why?Is it possiblle because I need to repeat myself to my doc like I'm a new guy every time i come.?

I know it's vol.call.chann.blocker and not Gaba agonist,antagonist!?, Will mentioned meds can help me this week? As i dont wanna explain her again which was said and agreed. 

I will definettely try to taper plan with psych but something about benzos makes me forgetfull, and I have rash from Xanax and Diazepam not big but weird.

Phenibut is out of the option.

Am I being scared for no reason?

Sorry for long post

Love, peace

Pregabalin (and other gabapentinoids) tend to really fuck with my mental state when withdrawing. Doesnt have to be a major wd. There is depression which brings a host of other woes like agitation, anxiety, poor appetite, no energy, thoughts of being the biggest fuck up on the planet and maybe I shouldnt be here kinda stuff. Cannot say why these states come on but if one has experience(s) these or other extreme downs maybe one is freakin out cause this is to be avoided at all costs. IDK. I have dropped every substance I am on to the point where they are effective but will offer the least crippling withdrawals if they suddenly are gone.

It seems that pregabalin (or the lack thereof) has been a major contributor to my lowest states of mental wellness. I do not want to go there as it scares me and I no longer fret unduly if they are low.

Maybe it's the *fear *of withdrawal from pregab that is causing the reaction...?

thanks man it's exactly that. it's only thing in these couple years like 3-4 years never have I misplaced or took too much buprenorphine, xanax-yes but I wasn't happy with xanax and truly I never felt that euphoria only from loraz and that's small like trippy then fall asleep, but I never blacked out, no incarcerated, or even in E.R. And I was partying hard before and driving but never when f...up or even slightes( ok thats a lie but trust me or not I don't have a ticket) but that has to do with when we were going gome like in mid day after after-party)!

And like you say I'm not even feeling good when I had like stash for month cause of the tollerance, but man when I have those 3,4 pills left and I need to go to Groundhog day with my 80+ familly doc, I think i may be having PTSD just from going to her.8( (She actually prescribed me 75mg first time in 2 years) my dose is 750mg

I dunno will try again with L-theanine, maybe Kava, Taurine

If I order Phenibut by by me for a couple week till I burn stash, cannot control Phenibut but with all those years of pregabalin I think there is some cross.tollerance cause last time I needed like 6 grams to feel any warmth which lasted 2-3 hours then was puking(maybe was bad batch)

I would go to detox but they are not that good from others exp in that field and have a daughter, need to work and stuff...

i would say there is but its not exact imo. although phenibut is considered a gabapentinoid; i feel it to be different than gabapentin or pregabalin. more subtle but also more enjoyable in public. problem is imone would have to at least tripple the dose of phenibut to keep pregab wds at bay and that is just the most it can do at this ratio. to stave off wds from 300mg pregab i would have to dose about a gram of phenibut  not too bad. but if i am at 1g pregab it would require over 3g phenibut which is getting into doses of phenibut that i wouldnt feel healthy for me. 

a t the below dose:

i would be seriously tired and ill. 

i like phenibut but can only dose every few days and keep the magic. still at the same dose or lower than where i started about 4 or 5 yrs ago. as a matter of fact i had been dripping to 600mg the last month getting ready to give it a rest for a while but received a free package in the post (from manufacturer) of phenibut and know that when i dose the usual 1.5g again i will be in flight. lol

your dose is at 750mg or 75mg a day of pregab? 

i use to dose up to 900mg over a few hours and eat valium. what a trip had to stop as shit was going sideways.

First aff all I see you joined bluelight at my birthday but 30 years later exactly![:cheers:](https://www.bluelight.org/community/data/assets/smilies/845B817C-7A16-4D71-947C-7AD878633057.gif)

My dose is 750mg daily, was till thursday, now is 150,150,300 which is 600mg. I went to my pdoc earlier, so like she's reading my mind cause now she gave me Clonidine and I asked:

We don't have Clonidine in Croatia or!?, She says yes you smartass but the two or three pharmacies can order or have sometimes cause hospitals order them for opioid crisis.. so She gave me 2cnd special.prescrip. for CATAPRESAN(only German intructions but I already knew about clonidine nevet tried it) Concerta is something that she prescribed me a year ago, cause last antidep. Venlafaxine (effexor-US, in my country is Velafax or Alventa, I cold turkey that from 225mg a year, also mirtazapine-which was great but I couldn't believe how real can be dreaming pain-like being stabbed by some pipes and...uhhhh, and then realize that is a dream and couldn't snap out off it still.(was in whitdrawall hell about a week with zaps, than MPH helped me and is still,(you need spec. prescription cause ADHD is not and can't be cured for adults, I know only one more person who has Concerta prescribed and only from online forum....)

 the thing is I went through a lot SSRI's before and SNRI's, tramadol for pain from two knee surg, but I'm not depressed, or bipolar I only have addictive personality but towards my meds(pregabalin).

I now tried clonidine and I can't believe how I slept like a rock but again it's not that sedating, and I'm good with 225mg pregabalin and 2mg Bupe foe now, actually I have some time now and saved some benzos I will try kick bupe out-I'm prepairing for this and will ty if not I will see How bad and how taper will go.


As of Phenibut, Before pregabalin I also would be like knocked out( just saw my history of ordering from ND)to remind myself and I first order in 2017. as I was fooling around with GHB cause it was everywhere in dance-techno.afterparty's, my wife was also adored cause we had the sex all over the space-time![o_O](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f635.png)

![:alien:](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f47d.png).

I found Phenibut cause I won't in details but was NaGHB no GBl addict was using 6months, stopped everything when wife got pregnant, and Phenibut was a Godsend, albeit tiredness was battleing with amp.sulphate, and I always ordered like 3x180 bottles was affraid of the law-it's still grey area but powder would be more suspicious.

So I was lucky or not still debatting myself which is worse but I always look intoxicated on phenibut(but euphoria, music appreciation all that Gaba-b and in large doses I think is Gaba-a agonist,)beat the pregabalin in Hedonistic me but Pregabalin helped me not using drop of alcohol, nothing

Back on Phenibut I also had couple months of ordering capsules and I wass in more like physical withdrawal...but to not lie myself and others i think I had some benzos at the time and as i look at my history of ordering I ordered some when was on pregabalin and then effects changed like I only would be in like manic state(listening music, or watching some videos, movies) and in 2-3 hrs i would need to redose till I puked cause of acidity you know. But those last were from another vendor(European which were not that good as ND.

So for now I'm good and will see how it goes

I find tolerance to pregabalin rises quickly but that's not to say it wouldn't still help with anxiety but you may not "feel" it as when you first start taking and it sort of feels like a drunk feeling without sedation. People do report pretty bad withdrawals from long term use. Personally I'd say they should only be used as needed, like benzos. Taking them habitually is only going to be problematic long term. As it's prescribed I guess you can have some reassurance of supply but it doesn't mean the problem of dependence is any different.

It's surprising how pregabalin feels completely different if I eat a light meal beforehand. On an empty stomach it's an intoxicating, tense, manic and mildly psychedelic experience. With food it turns into a much longer lasting clear headed stimulant, with a touch of cognitive euphoria. Physical euphoria is higher on the empty stomach, but cognitive euphoria and feelings of wellbeing are significantly lower. I've repeated this experiment quite a few times, it's a consistent experience of mine.

I've abused Pregabalin for 3 and a half years, and I'm prescribed it now for nerve pain, and I've never ever experienced "intoxicating, tense, manic and mildly psychedelic" effects that you just spoke about. I've also never had an effect you describe as a "longer lasting clear headed stimulant, with a touch of cognitive euphoria" if taken with food. The max I was taking was 900mg per day but the effects don't really change after 600mg. Now I only take 150mg per day but sometimes order more to mix with opioids etc (which can be lethal so watch out). So what I'd like to know is, what doses are you taking? and are you definitely taking Pregabalin?

It's very subtle, some ppl(like you) don't experience the euphoria at all.

It's more mildly drunk if you're lucky, which isn't...to my understanding of the word "euphoric".


That feeling would only be euphoric to someone who's never taken anything.

I have bipolar disorder, so that manic euphoric feeling for me is most likely related to that. I also get closed eye visuals from it too. It's definitely pregabalin, I've tried many different sources and suppliers. I get a vaguely similar effect from phenibut, but less manic and not as enjoyable. Oh I also lose the effects completely if I take it two days in a row. Every 3rd day seems to keep them.

hi mate nerve pain patient here too unfortunately ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)


Can you please tell me how are you coping with nerve pain? for how long have you been suffering? is pregabalin really an effective cure?


I tried it but really can't bare it so much that prefer little heroin to relieve pain and I switched to vitamins and other supplements as a cure, I'm a little disheartened so I'd like to hear your experience.

Yeah pregab give me a drunken feeling and like I smoked a doobie on top of it. Also I get "shaky" if taking 300mg or above. After a couple years on pregab (at 100mg twice a day) it still gives me a "buzz" as I do not take it every day. I take kratom too so that helps also with the "high".

Eating fatty foods before or after definitley increases the effects. seems the more I eat the "higher" I get. Strange drug, IMO.

Come up time between eating and not before/after dose is not remarkable enough to remark on it. lol

Just my experienes. 

Best wishes and be safe?

Peace

Hi mate,


I've had nerve pain in my left calf for 20 years from an accident. I've got nerve pain in my left shoulder from 2 failed operations on a left bankhart repair (torn), and I've got nerve pain in my left arm as the result of cortisone steroid injections from a pain specialist that was supposed to make my shoulder better but actually introduced a new problem. The way I manage it, though not fully, is 150mg Pregabalin, 10mg Amitritilyne and 200mg Tramadol per day. This combination honestly provides the best relief for me personally. However, you should be aware of a couple of obvious things which you may or may not know: once your body has got used to these drugs, particularly the pregabalin, it is extremely difficult to come off of..even with the tiniest increments in a taper this shit does wild things to your brain like voodoo and you wouldn't believe the consequences of trying to come off of it. But, my nerve pain was beyond being manageable with any one or two of the other meds I  mentioned so I will be on them for life. My physiotherapist told me even the smallest of nerve damage can take up to 9 years to heal. I'm 42, and I've got it in 3 places..so I aint stopping these meds for love nor money. I would honestly suggest trying low dose amytritilyne first, that works for a lot of people, 10mg is really low, I was on 50mg but brought it down. I should mention I had chemo last year and that made everything worse, so I know even more definitely that I won't be stopping the meds.


Hope at least one piece of information gives you one progressive thought.


All the best!


S.A

That's interesting because my experience the opposite. If I take it on an empty stomach I get shaky like the other poster said, and I have this weird feeling of inner tension which ruins the benefits.

 How often do you take it? If I take it for 2 days in a row, I seem to lose all the good effects. So I always leave 1-6 days in between doses.

I take them once a week now i you are right past day 2 it loses its value because of tolerance. I was taking at one point 60 300 mg a day 15 just to start the day 31 years i had been using and even 10 years of continuous meth use did not mess me up as much as pregabalin nearly destroyed my kidneys mind was gone . Once a week is good you will not get addicted I can do a heroin wd standing on my head but a pregabalin wd scares the fuck out of me

How on earth can one abuse pregab for years? I was prescribed it twice, first time 300mg were like being drunken, first time 900 I got all this manic dissociative goodness and I am not manic by nature. But after some time of 600mg/d all the effects were gone for good. Up to 2g nothing, then a grand mal like seizure. You are lucky to survive 18 fucking grams...


But what might answer the OPs question is that pregabalin gets actively transported into the blood by a transporter in the gut, so taking it with a meal will change the absorption.

I was one of the ones who got very easy withdrawals and had doubts believing the horror stories about pregabalin. After ten mild withdrawals or so in a 3 or 4 years period, I got very uncomfortable paws that seem to last forever. It is around 7 months from my last dose of pregabalin, the paws consist of probably a glutamate storm that makes me feel anxious and uncomfortable in general, tiredness, difficulty concentrating and bad sleep.


My common recreative dosage of pregabalin was 225mg+150mg, though I got up to 600mg+300mg at the peak of tolerance a couple of times. I used to do quick tappers every time I wanted to quit. I tried slow ones too and didn't experience much difference in the resulting mild withdrawal which no matter the slowness was unavoidable but mild and short-lived. The problem for me never was the withdrawal if not the paws that I have now.


I believe the problem is with the GABAergic system because any amount of alcohol or benzos brings back mild withdrawal for a few days (increased tiredness, even worse sleep, headache,  tinnitus, bloated stomach, diarrhoea, sweating, depression and smelly farts). I have been as long as 3 months without a drink or benzo and after that, a double whisky brought back the withdrawal the next day. The alcohol didn't seem to kick either giving an extremely mild effect with no tolerance at all, this reduced effect from alcohol started before and it has to be related to my abuse of pregabalin. Never had any withdrawal of benzos or alcohol before and I abused them very very rarely. Anyone has found this is happening to them? Never heard of anyone in my internet dips explaining that paradoxical relation between alcohol and pregabalin paws and that worries me. Any advice on treatment that anyone has tried? I do exercise and eat well and all. How long do you think I should be away from any gabaergic before I can be in the clear.


Interestingly even very weak things with some GABA activity like bacopa monnieri or ashwagandha bring back the withdrawal symptoms too. They seemed to help in the beginning but it was just postponing the unavoidable.


Quite a shame because I loved pregabalin, which put me in my best mood and it is probably my favourite drug for abuse, but it seems the price got too high for me.

Above 450mg preg became toxic for your body, you we’re taking 600mg as a single dose, may be that’s the issue. When I’m on preg run for couple of weeks sometimes months I never take more than 300mg in single dose and I’m taking 1-0-1. When I’m on lower doses mostly 150mg I take 1-1-1

I very rarely took 600mg in a single dose. Just in the beginning when I was doing it very often and got quite a tolerance and build it slowly up there. The problems and paws came to in the tenth or so withdrawal much later when I was not taking such high doses anymore as I wasn't taking it many days in a row anymore as I found it to be a waste of time with the rampant tolerance, and with experience I found 225mg to be the sweet spot for me. I blame it on the number of withdrawals more than the few times I took too high of a dose. Not saying high doses are innocuous and don't cause harm, they sure do to some extent. Pregabalin has been shown to be extremely variable in different individuals in effect, effectiveness and harm.

But well, I am looking for solutions and related experiences and I know very well my use of pregabalin was far from ideal (it was abuse really).

Good luck! I hope you will find a solution and you will recover fully! Try to do extended morphology test, urine etc. I’m doing regularly just to be sure if my body is alright. Maybe there is something else that cause that and preg was just helping you to not feel any uncomfortable things you have.

Thanks. I already did. Everything is normal besides some monocytosis. The doctor said it was because I had been ill recently. I haven't, but really I didn't feel like explaining to him my life and I don't have much trust in doctors with these kinds of issues, normally they know close to nothing. If I haven't found the right paper I doubt very much they are going to find it. Sad to have to trust a drugs forum before a doctor, but it is the reality in which we live with those matters.

I took 600mg at about 2pm. It's now 9pm almost and I feel like I've plateaud.

I realise I have to be careful with this drug as I've felt their withdrawal from stupid high doses back in my 20s.

This drug gives me so much motivation. I can't help doing useful stuff, I can't walk past a sink and see dirty dishes in there, I frantically clean them; I'll tidy the house, do laundry, feeling great all the time.


I've managed to resist taking any more as I simply do not need it, and I know from experience I'll be wonky as fuck all day tomorrow if I take another 300mg capsule.

I have the memory problems too, they stayed with me long after stoping. The main difficulty is with finding words, no problems with episodic memory. I have a friend who takes it as prescribed for anxiety issues and he has them too.

Not worth as an occasional recreational drug IMHO if you already got those issues. You will be sabotaging any chance of healing that way.

I understand very well how difficult is to give up completely on pregabalin when you get wonderful effects from it. It took me ages to be able to give up one of the best drugs I have ever tried. And I don't really know if I will fall for it again, the danger is very real. But at this point, we are trading our cognitive abilities for a few hours of blessing.

You are just feeling helpless right now which is understandable. If you cannot do it alone you might be able with some help.

When drug use gets as irrational as ours it is very likely that there are underlying issues who take away our resources to deal with it. I believe most times drug abuse is a symptom and not a problem per se. Kind of a bad solution for some very real issues that need a solution.

You clearly want to stop and are in the contemplation phase of the change process. That means you are conscious of the problem but you haven't developed determination to solve it. It might help to look at the advantages and disadvantages of the situation at this point to help build determination to take action.

Not saying any of that is easy. Just explaining you the theory of the Prochaska and DiClemente model for change process. You might like to look into it to understand how the process works, where are you at and what is relevant at every phase of the process.

Only tried pregab for the first time this year to help with opiate withdrawal which it was fantastic for. I have since been using it off and on for "fun" i guess and sleep or to improve mood. Usually 150mg at a time never more than a full 300mg capsule. I like it at these doses but the side effects are very annoying, loss of verbal fluency, bumping into shit as if wasted on booze but not feeling any sedation. Very strange. If taken at night I find it provides a very deep restful sleep. I do worry about withdrawals so I try not to take it with regularity but like many on this forum, im no saint. Tolerance rises faster than benzos by a large margin in my experience but also seems to return quickly if you take a break. But yeh, in the final analysis good for a mood lift and reducing anxiety if you keep your tolerance in check.

This leaves me very worried....my doctor just retired and my new DR will not renew my clonazepam script even though I only take it 2-3 times a week max for sleep...he instead put me on 150mg Lyrica everyday which I seriously have to question the logic of....I have yet to even go the pharmacy to pick it up....benzos taken a couple times a week seems far safer than daily pregabilin. 

Maybe I'll not follow directions and only take it 2-3 times a week for sleep when I really need it....though it was prescribed for anxiety and sleep.

Very very concerning for me!!!!

Hi everybody, after 15 years of lurking I have decided to make an account & share a story.

 I’ve been reading this thread a lot as I recently got prescribed a bunch of 150mg Lyrica. The first time I took it, I took 300mg in the evening and ended up feeling groggy and falling asleep. Woke up a little loopy but after about 15 mins I was ok and felt a nice anxiolytic effect throughout the day.

 The following day, I wanted to see how this feels during the daytime while being out & about. At 3pm, I took 3 capsules totaling 450mg. This was after a rather large meal. I hopped in the shower & felt it creeping up as I was finishing up. When I got out the shower, I felt what I would describe as a light MDMA type afterglow. I noticed that what I was seeing was a little more saturated too. As I was leaving I decided to take one more capsule which brought the total to 600mg. 

 As I was walking to the train, it felt like I was just flowing with the breeze. When I got to my spot downtown where I like to sit around, I noticed that the effects seemed to be fading. Despite reading about mixing alcohol & pregabalin being risky as alcohol is strongly potentiated, I wanted to give it a go. I bought a 24oz twisted tea which is 5% alcohol. I downed the can in 3 mins and after about 10min started to feel a slight loss of coordination & a light drunk feeling. I spent about 20 mins walking around and I decided to get another drink since I wasn’t feeling much. 

**This was a mistake.

**I got a a can of 24oz can of 8% abv Mikes Harder Lemonade. As soon as I left Duane Reade, I cracked it open and started downing in within a few mins. I started to walk uptown and it felt like as soon as I drank that can, the first one started to really hit me. I was walking & feeling really talkative so I joined a group voice chat. 

 15 mins after drinking the Mikes, my balance became fucked as well as my vision. Every 20 steps or so, my feet would just twist & have me stumbling from one side of the sidewalk to the other. I was really into my walk & the conversation over the phone but I couldn’t really form coherent sentences & as many people note, my memory was bad. Time seemed to fly by but I attribute that to the drunkness. 

 I ended up walking about 36 NYC blocks stumbling around the entire way. Eventually I sat down in Washington Sq. I was sitting on a bench looking through my phone & after a little while I got a strong urge to take a nap & I did exactly that. I just leaned back, closed my eyes and almost instantly fell asleep.

 I woke up to 2 girls talking to me which seemed very concerned about my well being LOL. One was asking me if I’m alright and shoving my phone into my pants pocket & telling me not to lose it. I assume I had dropped it when sleeping or it was just on my lap. Both the girls were asking me if I’m gonna be ight & if I live far. 

**Just wanna make it clear that they seemed genuinely concerned & I doubt this was a flirty move.

**I laughed everything off & thanked them. One of them dapped me up & they left. After the nap I started to feel like I was sobering up a bit so I started heading for the train. I ended up falling asleep on the train, missing my stop & having to wait on a train back. By now, I started to go back to that “afterglow” type feeling. I took the train to my stop & had to wait on a bus for about an hour. The entire time I felt calm as a Hindu cow, up until I got home. I went to sleep with no problem and slept for about 10 hours. 

 It was hard to open my eyes when I woke up, but other than that everything was normal. 

 Sorry for such a long post, just wanted to share my experience as I find it interesting how everybody’s account of using this seems to vary in various ways. I was also wondering if anybody has noticed that using Pregabalin causes bloating? Anyway, cheers.

Anyone have any experience with 4-methylpregabalin? I’ve heard it’s 1.5-2x as powerful, buT in terms of the effects produced im not so sure. I lost my regular lyrica source so bought 6 grams of 4-methylpregabalin to give it a go.

I'm an idiot. I was coming off from preg, i was already on 2mg diazepam daily coming long way from alpra and clonazepam. I've started to take sertraline cause i was diagnosed recently that i've got PTSD and it started 13 years ago!!! So i thought coming off from preg slightly wil make first side effects of ssri less problematic. And 3 days was all fine and what i did today? Yesterday before sleep 25mg sertraline, 300mg preg, at work 12mg bromazepam, after work i've sniffed speed (with ssri wtf), took 20mg diazepam and now 300mg preg to fall asleep before work. Fucking monday, i hope tomorrow will be all back on track. When i'm not taking preg im going with benzo but pregabalin is the issue, god mode feeling.


Because of speed i will pass tonight with sertraline, i've seen friend with serotonine syndrom, aint taking that risk. Stupid me.


Only good thing i'm already clean from opioids, i had problem witth tramadol and oxycodone 5 mg prolongest with 1ml ampuls with morphine helped me a lot to go as low as possible and be able to work and only problem i had for a week always not enough loperamid xD

At least one problem for now solved.

Damn guys and gals. I find Gaba and Lyrica one of the best drugs at high doses. 4000mg Gaba, fantastic for anxiety. I melt in my recliner at 1200mg of Lyrica. Crystal remains a little edgy smoked and hot railed (I don't use sharps anymore). H is God, as we all know. The effects of Lyrica at 1200mg, for me, is like a baby dose of H. I've been an addict since 18. I'm 53 now and people react differently with the Gaba type drugs. It's a positive for me. P.S. ...never, ever, ever start methadone or Suboxone as a daily regimen. Sorry for the rant....

At one point I felt that 900mg was almost like an H overdose. My pregab tolerance was almost nil and had about 50mg diazepam as well as few beers in me. One of the best buzzes I have had to date.

Welcome to bl, bud. How'd ya happen upon us?

Hey, thanks for the comback. I've been on the sidelines, reading other people's experiences and advise for a couple years now. Life's been a wild ride and I too have  much to offer. That beer/Lyrica thing is the cats ass. A melting kind of experience. Mental and physical. It is H like, but I believe people react differently to the Gaba type drugs. A couple of my peeps hate it.

And to be clear, I don't recommend these high doses. I have a high tolerance. 300 Lyrica is where I began. 900 of Gaba. But, this too may be different depending on the person.

Found isotonic drinks or the sachets of isotonic powder helps a lot. Also I’m on a gut relaxation med and the name escapes me at the mo.

I was reading the first post on this thread by the late, great Capt. Heroin. We miss him. Interesting how every individual differs with Lyrica. Lyrica at doses 450mg plus a day made me hyper. Gabapentin 300mg every 45 minutes makes me euphoric (plus the pain relief from nerve pain/neuropathy) but gave me serious nods/sleepiness later in the day, no matter how much coffee I drank.

That is my experience too.  But gabapentin can also make me hyper.  I end up more relaxed later on though on gabapentin where as pregabalin can have me restless.


I like both drugs, but really in lower doses, 1800 mgs of gabapentin or 300 mgs of pregabalin I can not tell any difference until it comes time to sleep.  I sleep a little deeper on gabapentin.  I have jerked awake on pregabalin where on gabapentin I am in a deep sleep.  But I think it is my individual body chemistry.  But I also see there are other posts comparing the two and people like on or the other a little better.  Probably all due to body chemistry.  What really trips me out is people on say about 300 mgs daily of pregabalin that stop and do not get a withdrawal.  Strange class of drugs.

This is wierd to me as well. It is the only drug that causes a deep depressive state in withdrawal. Others I feel more homicidal than the suicidal. 

Some get no wd at all.

I'm finding it extremely hard to get off this shit. I can go 3 days/nights without it then I start to crave it for sleep even if it only gives me 5 hours of sleep a night. Used to give me a full nights well rested rest even felt really good in an awesome mood the next day, now nothing I just feel "normal"

Prolly shouldnt dose this every day unless prescribed so from a doctor for specific issues. Just my opinion. Its a gabapentinoid iirc and these are notorious tolerance boosters. Only way I found to keep the magic is to do it less than twice a week and as I understand it this may be pushing it. Works for me.

Of course tolerance is an issue with everything I have run up on. 

Any depression after a couple days without? Just curious.

Peace

I will try my hardest to keep it to twice a week and see if the magic returns.

I don't think I get depressed after a couple of days without....just annoyed that I cant sleep, and irritable. I used to take 300mg, now I take 450mg but I still don't get the good mood the next day.

Well I just tried 100mg seroquel plus 100mg Lyrica prescribed by my psychiatrist and I just woke up from the vividly realistic nightmare that I've ever experienced ever!

Had to even call my sister (long distance to another country) to make sure she was indeed alright and she was fine ![😅](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f605.png)

Interestingly she said she was also prescribed Lyrica when she was recovering from cancer a d had to stop due to severely weird dreams that caused her extreme distress when she woke.

It did give me whst feels like a good night's rest....but I simultaneously feel like I experienced some sort of trauma because I could not distinguish the nightmare from regular reality even after waking up.

I usually dream quite vividly even on heavy doses of benzos and THC but I can always tell I'm dreaming ...it's like Lyrica removes the filter that let's me know my dream isn't real....the even stranger part is that right before bed I had this amazing idea for a movie/TV series/book about a guy who lives 2 lives and in each he thinks the other is a dream but the plot eventually intercedes into both realities and the point of the story was that the main character was actually living 2 lives and could affect things in each reality thst would have an impact on the other.

I'm guessing (without bothering to look it up) thst vivid dreaming is a known side effect of Lyrica???

As someone who only smokes weed with the bit of recreational usage of.. Everything(although very sporadically) is this drug worth having around? 


I've been offered it and turned it down got an injury I have. I've never really tried many pharmaceutical drugs. Wouldn't mind having something else on the shelf to indulge in that's 'different' if people reckon its something worth doing? 


I don't have an addictive personality, I'm past using drugs daily besides weed. I don't know what that is like regarding this but removing that issue if it is one, would anyone here recommend I bother getting some next time I see the doctor?

why the hell not, bro. it can provide a break in the monotony. as long as you skip days (3 or 4) before redosing pregabalin it should remain fairly reliable as far as effects and helps keep tolerance and addictions at bay.

i wouldnt go above 300mg on the first dose. 200mg may get it but....

please read upnon some takeaways. like potential loss of coordination, sudden jerkiness or uncontrolable movements, blurred vision, etc. if dosing above what is prescribed dont plan on driving or operating machinery or other potentially hazerdous objects. 

its like drinking, weed and benzos all in one at higher doses for me. but without most of the downsides to alcohol... dehydration, headache, suckness etc

i see ya dont mess with anything but weed.  

dont mix with opiates.

I don't know about long term. For me it lowers  disinhibitions and anxiety but makes me seem slightly intoxicated, as my balance goes to hell on large doses.

I have heard of memory problems appearing in people who take it daily.


What do you mean by turnin into my mush?

Yes, my experience is this is very much the case. Even on therapeutic doses. I don't think it is as bad for memory as benzos, you will remember the previous day but the loss of verbal fluency is quite annoying.

I could stick exclusively to Lyrica forever if it were practical. Too bad tolerance increases unlike any drug I know. I swear that shit rises exponentially or something, in the literal, mathematical use of the term. Even after tolerance breaks it quickly rises right back up, and it's never quite the same experience as the first handful of times again anyway. That and the obvious withdrawals.


Still love it, and can I say coke and Lyrica is a godly combination, imo anyway.

Sorry I read it wrong. I would say I am still waiting for tolerance from an eight day bender with a day and a half tolerance break in between. IF I even remember correctly. Still not doing well from it all. I would say pay attention and do let us know when possible.

I kept reading about pregabalin and recreational use so I've ordered some Indian generics. First 300mg were like a new variant of feeling drunk. Then some times later I should get it offered by my doc against social anxiety, he titrated me up from 75mg, this way it had no recreational properties at all, I barely felt a difference - it might have reduced anxiety a bit but nothing spectacular. Was on 600mg/d for some time, then titrated down without problems. Some time later I decided to give the leftovers a new recreational try - 900mg without tolerance. This remains to be one of my top 3 drug experiences ever, and I couldn't recreate it even long time after. Was like a dissociative, a stimulant and something unique at the same time. Disinhibiting as fuck.


Later I opted for pregabalin again, helped me to cut down on morphine but as before, no recreational properties even when I started on 600mg and went to 1.2g pretty quickly. Just gave me weird electrical zap feelings in the extremities which should be the foretaste to full on seizures when I did 1.6  or 1.8g because of no real effects.


This stuff is the single most rapid and lasting tolerance inducing agent I've ever met. Wonder if it really retains its therapeutic properties when staying at 600mg/d.


Also it has 3 mechanisms of activity: First the alpha2delta calcium channel antagonistic one which is most known. Then the induction of an enzyme which converts glutamate (the most abundant excitatory transmitter) to GABA (the inhibitory counterpart) thus being an indirect GABAergic and probably what causes withdrawal. And last but not least in high dosages a GLT-1 glutamate transporter antagonist which will be how it causes its stimulatory and possibly dissociative-like effects.

This raises the possibility that therapeutic (lower) dosages might be more withdrawal inducing than higher ones which will upregulate GLT-1. At least I didn't experience any withdrawal once tolerance was built.

I never got tired from it, was rather taking all in the morning to feel at least some anxiolysis. But low dosages should theoretically work, and I've read often that it helps to sleep while withdrawing from opioids.

How much pregab and seroquel are you taking?


I felt some brain fog the first weeks on 600mg/d which is more pronounced when taking as recommended vs. all at once. But it was pretty light. It's a weird drug..

I have read of many accounts of this but cannot cite them atm.

But I havent had issues but then again my use is sporadic at best.

Gabapentin was a dif story. Been years but got to where Gs would provide nada.

Well my 4-methyl pregabalin never arrived sadly. I heard it was roughly 1.5-3x as potent as lyrica and is indistinguishable in its effects, so I’m bummed I was never able to try it out. Fortunately I was able to procure 60 300 mg lyrica capsules a few days ago. 


It’s been about 2 months since I’ve last used it. I had gone through 120 300mg caps over the span of 3 months or so, using it nearly everyday (300-900mg). For whatever reason I’m one of the lucky ones that doesn’t experience debilitating withdrawals upon discontinuation. 


There does seem to be a slight lingering tolerance that occurs with lyrica, albeit I do have quite a long history of GABAergic abuse, but it’s nothing too extreme. I tried taking 300 mg yesterday and it definitely did the trick. As someone who suffers from severe anxiety and depression, lyrica has been a great tool in alleviating both ailments without creating issues that normally go along with drug abuse. 


I plan on studying for my summer calculus exams today. Just popped 300 mg of lyrica and 30 mg of adderall. Great combo for studying as long as the lyrica dose stays below 300 mg. Anything above that and my cognitive abilities start to diminish.

How is lyrica when used in conjunction with cocaine? Does anyone have any experience with these two?


I’ve heard that you shouldn’t mix cocaine with ca2+ blockers as it will increase the cardiotoxic properties. Then again I’ve read reports stating otherwise.

Phenibut worked really really well for the social anxiety / shame energies inbalance that I have been experiencing for a LOT of time. Problem is I had to stop because It would feel so caustic for my stomach. 


I am looking for a substitution, ideally that I can do 2 times a week (going out/socialization). But if 2 is too much in the long run 1 time a week can do it for me too. I´ll find other med to rotate it with.


How would you say it compares to phenibut in terms of A)Mood elevation/ego inflation B) Anxiety reduction ?


Is it safe to use it in such a way for maybe 1-2 years?

Pregabalin is far superior to phenibut in terms of mood enhancement and anxiety reduction.


I would stick to once a week at most though.


Some find it to be a bit more sedating than phenibut however.

I think they are in the same drug class (gabapentinoids) but I find phenibut at ones optimal dose is much more energetic, empathetic and social.

Prebabalin is more effective for getting "high" and can cause some serious issues with balance/coordination at higher doses (but feels great lol) like alcohol and benzos kinda mixed.

My take anyway.

They both seem to have *long *half lives so no need to keep re-dosing once you find your "sweet spot".

In my view, while Phenibut is a Gabapentinoid, it is notably different then both Pregabalin and Gabapentin (both of which are very similar).


Phenibut in my opinion is closer in some ways to a muscle relaxant, having some of the properties of Baclofen (Gaba B receptor agonist activity).  It also builds tolerance more quickly then other Gabapentinoids in my view.  It’s duration of action is longer, but it takes about twice as long for the effects to kick in, so that delay can cause you to redose too soon and overdo it.  ALL three drugs bind to the a-subunit, causing anti-anxiety and anti-seizure effects.


Do I think it’s overly harmful? Not in standard doses, but I *do* think it’s safety profile is inferior to Pregabalin.  I also feel it’s effects are inferior by comparison, possibly due to its poor blood brain barrier crossover (Gabapentin is notably better here, which is why a much smaller dose is effective).


I see it in the same way that I do cough syrup compared to gold standard ketamine.  One *does the job* while the other is notably safer, with more medical effects, uses, and euphoric effects.


I think Phenibut (obviously using responsible doses), is ok for occasional use, for example on the weekends over a solid period of time.  However, I would *STRONGLY* caution against frequent daily use.  Sudden withdraw after using for multiple weeks can cause not only similar effects to Pregabalin withdraw, it can also cause a baclofen-like withdraw.  Because of its activity at the Gaba B receptor, this could be very unpleasant and at high doses over time, a sudden withdraw could be dangerous too.

I think (but don't know for sure) that one difference is that phenibut has a different tolerance curve than gabapentin/pregabalin. These can't be sustained as recreational substances, you need to continuously increase the dosage, worse than with any opioid, and some time soon you'll reach complete tolerance where even an increase in dosage won't bring the effects back. Pregabalin is the single worst tolerance inducing substance I've sampled so far. Even when sticking to therapeutic 600mg/d it lost its efficacy very soon.


Phenibut is a GABA-B agonist quite like baclofen if I'm not wrong, while pregabalin/gabapentin lack this but have affinity to glutamate decarboxylase (or something similar) which converts glutamate to GABA and to the glutamate transporter GLT-1.

I had to quit phenibut as I said because of too many stomach issues. Also apart from that it just felt overall toxic. I don't know why but It just felt like that.

I would compare phenibut more to gabapentin although it works on different receptors bu I find it not that different. Pregabalin otoh is much stronger than those 2 with a normal low dose being possible to bring you into dangerous situations.

I find pregabs to kick in faster on empty stomach but feels the same as taken with food, maybe not so manic and energetic. I always get tons of energy and i can't stay still when took enough pregabalin (450-900mg), i'm like people who took meth when i take pregabs, very social, happy, energetic and i talk a lot, and i'm horny, very horny ![😅](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f605.png)

I would take it with a friend.  He said it was named Lyrica because it made him wax lyrical.  Lotta thought goes into the branding.  I felt like it was like molly lite.  Making me super chatty; euphoric and a little giddy.  But too much and feel staggering drunk, like fall on your face drunk.  I took 450mg daily for years; it wore off due to tolerance.  Now I just take 150 a day to maintain without withdrawal symptoms from yet another drug.  Prescribed it for nerve pain for about 15 years.

I like the mood lift and anxiolysis of pregab but tolerance rises too fast to use regularly and I am scared of forming a habit with it so haven't dabbled for a while. Its a wonder drug for withdrawals or comedowns tho. Also it seems to tank my verbal fluency which makes it not very productive if I have to be on my game as it were. It seems "safer" than benzos but thay might not actually be true. I'm talking specifically about seizure risk from overuse.

If i need a norco I am not sure substituting a pregabalin  instead would be such  a good idea.

I did a few doses of pregabalin and was much too and way too strong for me. Is a very potent medication

most definitely for me.

And much more potent than just the gabapentin ever was.

Gabapentin was worthless; I never even took it; couldn't tell if it did anything so I binned it.  Although I learned about the stacking doses in order to feel it much later ; after I paid thru the nose for 10 years of retail pfizer scripts of the much more potent lyrica.  Yes I also found myself searching for words curiously on it; which is why I lowered my dose as I felt the odd impairment it caused couldn't be good.  I learned it is a very cheap chemical that pfizer priced as gold.  Then extended the patent for years excluding generic suppliers.  Then they absorbed the biggest generic supply company which jacked the price, again.  Now, finally, I get it for 18 dollars a month.  Hundreds of $$ a month for years to Pfizer from me cuz my doc said it may help and then I found out I was addicted to it as well.

I just took 450mg pregabalin with 1mg alprazolam. I also just smoked a bowl of nice bud and am already on buprenorphine. Considering that i have almost zero tolerance to gabantinoids and benzos, so that combo should get me in really mellow head space. I also have more bud to smoke and one equal dose of both pregabalin and alprazolam. Today will be an ok day.

Yeah I've been through this. Gabapentin substitutes for pregabalin in the sense of covering any withdrawal symptoms. Granted gabapentin isn't nearly as enjoyable as pregabalin but it will cover all withdrawal symptoms.


I don't recall what the dose conversion was but I was on a hefty dose of pregabalin (900mg/day) tapered down to 150mg and switched to gabapentin, I believe 1800mg/day.

That's the same as me, dose wise; I was on 450, tapered to 150, now switching to 1800 of Gabapentin.  I don't get much fun out of the pregabalin at this point anyway; but I will save what I have left over for a rainy day; I certainly do feel high from like 450mg, I just don't do that anymore.

Thanks

The general point of reference is:


100mg Pregabalin = 600mg Gabapentin


I believe in this for the most part. The biggest problem would be the complicated pharmacology/pharmacokinetics of Gabapentin (Neurontin), especially compared to the relatively simple pharmacokinetics of Pregabalin. All I can say is, try to keep all variables the same when taking Gabapentin so you can expect a relatively straightforward experience.


For instance, if you are taking it three times a day, specifically take it after each meal. Stomach contents are the most important variable and can easily lead to a doubling of potency with Gabapentin. If you are able to take your pills at the right time, I don't think you should have much trouble.

Thank you and since we are on the subject *again* about gabapentin and also pregabalin for withdrawal synptoms I feel like the Pregabalin helped me much better through withdrawals because of the fact that it can help with anxiety. And is much stronger than gabapentin. Smoother. 


I did take Pregabalin a few days in a row for withdrawals. 


I took gabapentin one time for pain and it did not help and I didn't like gabapentin that much either.


They both can cause seizures and and have side affects because they are junk medicine's. And they are nothing I am too interested in. 


However, for withdrawals I would take a Pregabalin now. My question is :  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 

How long do I have  to wait for Pregabalin to be able to work after being on my favorite drug and doc NORCO ?? I stopped Norco because I ran out. Maybe I am withdrawing, I don't know but I am still wanting to use the PREGABALIN. PROPERLY ( i mean as a harm reduction tweek, to feel better ) ?


I took some  Norco and it really helped me now that I am going through my Methotrexate therapy. I was up and doing great mixing Methotrexate with Norco. Thanks DOC !! 


(the pain management situation is a whole different story. but Norco isn't around too much anymore. it's okay i smoke weed for pain too) 


But right now I am wanting to use Pregabalin for withdrawals. So how long do I have to wait for after taking the Norco for the Pregabalin to work properly ????

I found this on the Internet so far.


"Some medications, however, can interact with methotrexate and cause adverse effects. 

It's important to be mindful of these potential drug interactions to make sure you reap the 

benefit of the medication and keep side effects to a minimum."


Also it is saying that Methotrexate and Pregabaline causes malaise. When I took the Pregabalin previously, I wasn't taking Methotrexate.  


Maybe the gabapentin would be *safer *then !

Just on Lyrica at the moment, 225mg twice a day - 450mg total but tolerance to twice this amount a day all at once seems to do nothing recreationally now. Probably need more like 1200mg once a month instead of once a week lol.

Omg I took another Pregabalin, I think this is the fourth one. I took the other three, maybe four I hope not . . I can count the bottle quantity,  over a week ago but over a five day period. It has been more like a trip report than anything. I took one at night last night. One more and I should be able to write up a 'report'. 

And honestly I took some Pregab to try to feel better, and now I have to put up with the 'effects'.

I need a drug. I am sad.

Oh but the pregabalin helped me stop coughing.

From having to mole too much MM.

True story. Sweating.


I guess I will keep reading all of the side effects and eventually I will catch on.

Hope you feel better soon. I am scared of Pregabalin too. I mean me. I am. Pregabalin put the fear in me. I know eventually wears off though. Then other problems like sweating. Probably proves just that. I haven't completely recovered yet. It's worse than my origianal medication could have ever been.

I just took a Pregabalin. Maybe I will just lay here and watch t.v. Maybe I can be better in the morning. 

I am having fresh mandarin juice in water and some creme brule. I wish I could get up. I doubt it though. 

At least colors look pretty and I can just focus on sleeping some more. That's it for now. 

I will do some work tomorrow. And maybe when I can, when ever possible.

No but it helps for a mild cough suppressant. And some relief too. And it said helps with social anxiety. And I can do more with it. But I'm really all drugged up and like high or something. And helps a bit to get more work done. 

It probably helps with . . . .  everything except maybe acne and heart disease. 

But when I try to quit, I smell. Kind bad. Isn't it. 

I'm blasted on this shite right now. It's Nasty. I will tell you.

I had a brain little bit of zap when I first tried it, pregabalin,  Again. That scared me too. My brain din't like it imho. 


I didn't even realize this was the Megathread. I thought i was somewhere else. 


I research It too a lot. I just wait for someone to slip up and say what garbage it is. 


It is a very dangerous medication that promises pain relief imo. Lol. 


Not too good because of complications of withdrawal and adversities. 


And also just great is that I am bombed out of my mind right now after taking this. !!

No I mean I used to abuse it with big quantities once a week - now it’s more like once a month. Since taking it regularly tolerance really skyrocketed.

Unfortunately, I have allowed myself to become dependent on this shitty, demon drug.  I have been taking it off and on for 4 or 5 years to potentiate oxycodone.  I can take or leave the oxy but, damn, I can not quit the fucking Lyrica!  I used to take 150mgs twice a week.  Now, I’ll just gobble down 150mg capsules hoping to feel something.  i don’t think I have ever gone over 900mg in one day, though.


I now need to take 150mg everyday to keep withdrawal at bay.  If I don’t, I am extremely irritable, sweat profusely, can’t sleep, rls, and deep depression.  Oh yeah, I forgot about the lack of motivation and the hot and cold spells.


I want my life back.  I never thought I would become dependent on pregabalin.  I’m going to get some gabapentin and switch to that.  Hopefully I can then taper that.

Damn mate, that's really a bummer :/ Yeah, switch to gabapentin it might be easier to step off that just keep your doses low and roll off it. You can do it! You're def not an idiot, it happens to the best of us.

Pregab does have its downfalls.

Keep conscious of this.

I know they say it takes time to enter the system (weeks possibly) but found can be used as needed.

The only grug that put me in a space of not feeling wothy of being around and better off not being here.

Darkness like no other but quick to realize it and take action. 

Staying conscious and observant of effects of any substance are crucial imo/e.

Please do not just cease this med it is a mind fuck worse that benzos ime/e.

To some it seems to have no repercussions but to others a nasty and possibly deadly outcome.

Even going over 225mg isn’t going to do much. I take 1 150MG a day and it takes an hour or so to kick in and then I get like a sensation of being stoned in pot without the paranoia or overthinking stuff and it stays for a few hours even after taking daily for a couple years now. Anything more won’t do much. It’s a weird drug that way. U like gabapentin which you can take Luke 1000-1500mg if. The Oregabalin is about 2.5-3 times as strong so you need a much lighter dose for same effect. It wasn’t generic for years so I was on GABA for a few years at 800mg twice a day but the PRE GABA is definitely stronger and once became a generic option my insurance covered it. It really helps both my neuropathy as well as anxiety both and I’ve never had a withdrawal from it although they say you can and not to quit without a tapering off.

Strange. I’ve never once got a depressed or mental mood change whatsoever after 4 years of 150MG a day. It’s different for everyone but start low at like 75MG if it’s pregabalin and about 350mg if gabapentin. Higher doses such as 600/1200 respectfully can definitely be far too much. I’m 52 and weight 175lbs and it’s been a wonderful drug for my neuropathy and anxiety both. I’ve stopped it for a couple weeks at a time cold turkey and never had any symptoms of withdrawal either. Definitely different for everyone but just sharing my experience FYI. Cheers.

Yep... seen many posts like this.

Just to give a heads up to those who *may *experience symptoms akin to these of sudden cessation and recognize it for what it is.

Glad that this doensnt have an effect on you in this regard as I and some others find it quite a pickle.

Be blessed and stay safe.

I've been taking 900-1200mg 3x week.  The other days I take 150mg just to drag my self into work.  I am really too old for this shit.  I am so sick of feeling like crap.  I am going to get clonidine and gabapentin and do a proper taper.  

How do I fight the cravings for Lyrica though?

No but I’ve heard of it causing neurotoxicity (is that the right word?) in chronic kidney disease patients.


It didn’t cause the disease though.

Ya may not feel the cravings if gabapentin is used and the other.

Ya can also taper off pregabalin rather quickly.

Just my experiences.

I took some powder out of a pregabalin this morning trying to take only half the capsule. I did that last night and took 25mg's. Because I took half out of the capsule.

So I tried again this morning and too much spilled out so I ended up taking almost the whole capsule.


The thing is I put the powder on my tongue. Yes it's bitter but I get the effect immediate that way. Wow it really worked fast. 


I have never tried taking Pregabalin before. And it is interesting. Whatever it is. Some really weird powdered medication for sure !!


It is so ridiculous on how little get's me so wasted. It's almost embarrassing and is even difficult to explain I find. 


I am taking it for my cough and for my pains. (( Physical ones))  Help's me to get up off of my arse.

Anyway 25mg's was the perfect amount for me. I didn't have to stumble through the hallways if I had to get up !!


I slept real well. And I work up and was energetic. Not too bad. So far. ![👍](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f44d.png)

Hi everyone

So I was completely clean from every substance - even caffeine - for 2.5 weeks in August prior to returning to college because I knew I'd be using stuff here and there.


I used to be a heavy binge drinker, but managed to completely stop drinking (1+ year alcohol free) by using Phenibut. Phenibut has become my true love for socializing, euphoria, relaxing and basically everything alcohol was doing. It is also good for nerve pain which I have and excellent for stimulant comedowns, which I also deal with. I take Adderall therapeutically as a pre-med at a very competitive university.


But phenibut has some glaring downsides. The high/afterglow lasts for a long ass time which is great, but the rebound also lasts a while and can make it really hard to function. Not ideal when u need to be high functioning basically every day.


I requested pregabalin from my doctor this past July, and he prescribed it. At first, I found it was almost everything i'd hoped for: phenomenal for nerve pain, excellent for getting to sleep after using Adderall. Unlike phenibut I don't experience much euphoria from pregabalin but also have not felt any hangovers/rebounds. I think this is the reason I got a bit cavalier w/ my pregab dosing schedule, seeing that it would let me get to sleep and wake up fully functional the next day.


I started taking pregabalin 1-2x a week during the 2nd week of december at doses from 200-600 mg each. Similar situation 3rd week sept, but more like 200-300. However, I've had a ton of tests the last week of sept and this first week of october, which means I took more Adderall than usual, which means I took pregabalin more like 3-4x/week. In hindsight I should have just dealt with some shitty nights of sleep and megadosed magnesium, but pregabalin seemed so benign and I was never exceeding 350 mg during this time.


I last dosed on sunday night. Monday I felt normal, Tuesday is where I got concerned: some brain fog, lethargy, increased nerve pain, and insomnia. Bizarrely, I had burning leg skin when I was trying to sleep which I;ve never had before; however, I took adderall at 3 pm for an exam, and adderall comedowns always include bizarre, unpredictable effects.

I ended up sleeping for 5 hours last night and feel pretty blegh today. I just am having trouble distinguishing this from my usual bleh self.


**So, my question: after taking pregabalin 1-2x/week for 2 weeks and 3-4x a week for 2 weeks at doses of 250-400 mg, what's my likelihood of experiencing withdrawals? I should note I have not noticed any tolerance develop: even the lower doses will still hit me quite strong.**


also:

I have one more exam tomorrow before a 5 day break with a pretty low amount of work and obligations. I’d like to take adderall for this last exam before taking a break, and probably phenibut afterwards so I don’t feel like absolute fucking shit all of tomorrow during the comedown, and because I have an event that night that will be a million times easier with phenibut. Then I will just get raw dogged by the comedown and accept that it is what it is and take a long break from everything.


**how much worse is the phenibut comedown likely to be than normal given my pregab dosing?  And would taking phenibut tomorrow possibly push me over the threshold where I risk developing kindling where I’ll basically have issues with GABAergic/gabapentinoid drugs for quite a long time?**


thanks everyone

My eperience was a bit like yours. There was a prescription of Dextro-Amphetamine of 35 mg a day. And at the same time i was precribed Pregabalin at 225 mg a day. 

Could have been i took less of both sometimes as i had a surplus when it ended. 


But I was on Pregabalin a lot longer then you. I cold turkeyed it. Didn't have a clue it could be addicting and felt fine. No WD symptom's, same for D-Amp I CT-ed and had none. The thing that will be something to consider is the cross tolerance with Phenibut which would mean your on this class of drug's a lot longer. 


Do you still have some incase you need to taper?

If you do experience withdrawal, I believe the symptoms will be manageable and not enough to render you completely non-functional. That is the only thing that could be said with certainty. The best educated guess is you'd have something like a common cold for a bit coupled with heightened anxiety and insomnia. I know these terms are probably pretty scary, but I don't believe they will be severe enough for the average person to find a way through. We're here to help you if that happens.

Pregabalin does enhance opioids in a perfect sinergy. 600mg with 280mg methadone Gave me a 3-4hour flash. Pregab taken 2 hours before. Mixed with benzos algo kicks in and you have a knocked out for a couple of hours.

Anybody has take with amphetamine?6. I did today I have my belly inflamed. I took 300mg i cant remember when but I worked all night and Im still  drugged. Im alone at the office and Ihave been trapped to bluelight.org hahaha listening to good techno. Now its 5am and Im Gonna take my sleeping pills to stop the amphetamine effect. Fuck amphet is strong. Im new in amphetamine paste and IMO its só far stronger than coke. But Im surprised cuz I IVed and I felt nothing.

Have a nice dreamings.

Lots of LOVE to the bluelights users.

I read all of the bad negative warnings about pregabalin and just didn't want to get involved with it . . . . 

because they made it out to be so dangerous. It almost helps me like the hydrocodone did nut 

omg it gets me so wasted. like how others drink a whole six pack of beer. 

And it sure doesn't make me tired. Yet ! Not real sure yet. But had some good times at the end of Summer. !!

Tell us if you get some weird dreams. I always found gabapentin gave me weird but cool dreams.  I'll always remember a dream about Randy Rhodes and Randy Savage racing at watkins glen, and they were like rhe same person though, like my brain had fixated on "randy" and racing, lol.  Not unpleasant though, never a nightmare, just interestingly weird dreams from gabapentin.

I've also never had an effect you describe as a "longer lasting clear headed stimulant, with a touch of cognitive euphoria" if taken with food. The max I was taking was 900mg per day but the effects don't really change after 600mg. Now I only take 150mg per day but sometimes order more to mix with opioids etc (which can be lethal so watch out). So what I'd like to know is, what doses are you taking? and are you definitely taking Pregabalin?

Is it better to take Lyrica with food or without ? 

Or does't it really matter that much.


*Also*, I wait longer than three hours to dose. Much longer. Over six hours and 24 at times.

I thought fat helped absorption?  Or that food helped because it slows down the speed it goes through your intestines.  Im asking here, not pullin an "akshually".  Of course obviously a nice clean and pristine intestinal tract will be good at absorbing too.

according to studies i’ve read, food has no appreciable impact on lyrica bioavailability. but it has a significant effect on rate of absorption.


i take it the second i wake up to give it bit of empty stomach before breakfast, or it takes forever to get me where i want.

I'm just gonna jump in and go.


I am currently starting pregablin again and increasing my dose monthly til I get back to what worked when I stupidly decided to switch back to gabapentin for literally no reason.


I've been an opiate/benzo addict many years and I'm on methadone which helps me keep my opiate issues under control but I've fucked up my gaba system sooooo much with a couple of years of really severe alcohol abuse followed by years of extreme benzo use that when i am not actually taking benzos I become so crazy anxious it's unbearable. I literally white knuckled it 2 years just using methadone and hoping my brain would heal and my gaba system quit acting like my hair is on fire 24/7, it was horrible. Then I linked up with a psych prescriber who put my on Lyrica and quickly bumped me up to a pretty decent dose, forgive me for not remembering the exact amount. Finally I had some relief, I can't take benzos while enrolled in methadone but Lyrica is allowed and while it's far from completely fixed, my chronic anxiety is muffled somewhat. 


So I got a wild hair up my ass and last spring told doc I wanted to try gabapentin after I read someone on Reddit who was super against pregablin and looved gabapentin. 


Cut to me relapsing hard on street drugs and spending the summer in that familiar insanity with new actors like fentanyl performing the same play. So I got out of rehab in late Sept and immediately was like "doc I fucked up going off my pregablin, it precipitated my relapse and I bet it was linked to it %100, get me back on that shit like yesterday " 


Now I'm impatiently waiting to get back to the therapeutic level that I was on before and annoyed about the entire learning experience I turned summer into.


Also, I get munchies worse on this chem than any other out of the dozens I've ingested over 34 years of life... Anyone else take one or two and suddenly feel like it's been a week since you ate? ![😆](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f606.png)![😆](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f606.png)![😆](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f606.png)![😆](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f606.png)

Lyrica is really helpful *most of the time*, however, I still have days and moments when I get anxiety. Are there other Lyrica users who also take something "as needed" for anxiety - a benzo perhaps?

***** Not only does it keep me from being hungry it gives me incredible energy. And it definitely makes me calm and not have anxiety. But isn't that called being high. 


Anyway I do bumps of it as needed. I don't know what this stuff is but it's like a notch away from tripping on all kinds of stuff and all at the same time. I can't believe I went through a bottle of 26 capsules like they were evaporating. 


Wow. I hope this new doctor just dopes me all up like the other medical doc's back in the day. I sure wish we still had pain management around here again. 


I wish there was a place for pain management to still fit in here somehow in the community.  I hate the thought of driving forever and across the county line just to get a godforsaken pill. The stupidity of it all and everything. 


Well my doctor has to treat me before I start begging for treats. Loool. I'm going to need them with pain management out of town. So yes it's tough to have anxiety when I'm bombed out of my mind with Lyrica bumps.  And it comes and goes in waves and sometimes I'm in a drunken stupor. But basically it works. Good. 


*I haven't really been through the quitting part yet . . . . ever ! . .  and so far. Soo, I am probably going to need some help. And somehow, if I don't know how to ask properly.


Thnx !! ******

The pregabs totally cover the phenibut withdrawl . With pregabs unlike heroin the metal torture lasts at the same level for 6 or 7 days for me then like a switch its over. I went from 60 300 mg cut that by half straight away then a six month taper jumped at 100 mg with help of phenibut and valium and it was quite easy never just jump from high doses.


I have had countless heroin withdrawls never thought of suicide with jumping of high dose pregabalin i actually had the belt ready to stick on top of door

I just took my last Lyrica. I saved a little bit in the capsule for later but my bottle ran out. 


I just took it to get it over with finally and of course I had a headache and still do.   


This medication is not one that helps me out at all. The benefits do not outweigh the risks to me either.


To me it is completely recreational. And at least it will get rid of my headache. 


I will be quitting lyrica until I can find some more of this good stuff. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


It's very trippy so I don't have to worry about falling. It doesn't take long to hit.


I am going to taper from it with gapapentin. lol

Wow I must be getting old. Damn headache. I am so glad I had some pregablin to take today.

So I just bumped through a prescription of **25 Lyrica **capsules recently.


I am sweating pretty profusely and I don't sweat because I'm kinda fckin skinny so I never ever sweat. I keep spraying my under arms with a spray bottle of rubbing alcohol

because it stinks so very horrible . . . like skunk and I **hate** it . . . since i'm so f'ing hateful today ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) ![✌️](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/270c.png).  It happened immediately from my first bumps and I know it was because I have recently -----been able-----to stop taking hydroocodoneeee   yer knoh.


I am wondering if I can take **gabapentin** as a recreational bump or is this going to prolong the withdrawal even more **?**


And I am wondering if I should just sweat it out and how long does the **Lyrica withdrawal** last for **?**


My symptoms are making me hurt or maybe it is just the autoimmune disorder itself that is just the hurt and maybe the withdrawal is just some sweating and that is all **?**


And if I did bump some **gabapentin** tonight . . . how long do I have to wait until after taking **Lyrica** to -----be able-----to take thee **gabapentin** without it being too adverse of an effect. . . . I am seriously wondering** ??**


I took **Lyrica** yesterday morning.

Or wait . . . maybe i'ts because I never really used to sweat at ALL.


I do feel really sick right now . . .  like maybe I really could die in a few years . . . .but if I am NOT going to . . then I don't want to be addicted to all kind of drugs.


I mean if I can avoid it. 


I am going to see my doctor some time around next week.

So stressed out going to the supermarket with wife and kid. Only had 75mg Pregabalin this morning as prescription low so phoning tomorrow (usually take 225mg in the morning.


It really does help in these kinds of situations.

Take enough and ya get jerky, lose balance, thought processes etc wouldnt mix it with *anything *at high doses.

Be careful when on this substance.

The withdrawals consisted of severe body pain (or maybe this was the body pain I had before I started taking gabapentin and just didn't realize how much pain I was actually in until I stopped taking them again). The pain is very similar to the achey body feel of opioid withdrawal. The mental aspect sucked. Everything felt very boring. Although it was not the same excruciating "cry your eyes out" type of pain/bored that opioid or heroin withdrawals can bring, but it was bad enough to immediately make every day feel shitty.

The pain & bored & mental depression felt... different, than those same things you get from other withdrawals. Not sure how to explain it because it's a subjective experience. I'd imagine gabapentin or lyrica withdrawals could be pretty brutal if you're on them long enough.

Important post this. 


Mixing substances can be bad enough but for some reason with Pregabalin can be even worse (nodded off/blacked out on this with stuff like Diazepam, Alprazolam, Tramadol, Soma, umm what’s those giant orange pills called? They’re an Opioid too) ugh my life over the past year has been bad enough to think back.


Anyway not demonising Pregabalin, can be great after all and I do appreciate what it’s done for me def but just the mixing (just my opinion of course).

Nucynta?  Tapentadol or something is some powerful stuff IMO.  I would mix it with Lyrica and be high, oh so high.  But a babbling idiot, as if on some dreamy nodding -while-talking trip

I used to take 450mg/day of lyrica; made me chatty and a little manic, and also feeling like a vague MDMA high.

However, my doc switched me to gabapentin with my consent; seems a good way to avoid withdrawal, but it doesn't get me noticable high, but no empty vessel withdrawals anhedonia is how lyrica withdrawal hits me.  Gabapentin is ok for a replacement which is nice.

Now I am addicted to Gabapentin


Lyrica, in high doses was like being fall down drunk;  I couldn't ride a bicycle last time I had a 1g dose,

Am I the only one who really enjoys snorting like 75mgs at a time?  Tastes good enough, is smooth, and gets me high.

That's how I blew thru my last 10 pills or so. now I miss it.

But hydrocodone is another beast to slay; trying not to lament my lost Lyrica, as there is always something to get me high!

I guess Im a druggie.

Tapentadol.


Yeah pregabalin withdrawal is horrible but you can mitigate it a lot by tapering down then going on benzos for a week when you jump off the pregabalin.

but pregabalin seems pretty useless (as well as just about anything) to help with benzo withdrawal.

Sure it may help but it doesn't take the edge off like the other way around

I wonder if my doc would really prescribe librax for benzo w/d.

I like to combine all three gabapentinoids….


Gabapentin 300mg

Pregabalin 150mg

Phenibut 1500mg


Plus….


Methadone 80mg

Methylphenidate 30mg IR

Cannabis Indica 10mg

Etizolam 1mg


All of these pulverized powder in a glass, ounce of warm water to melt everything together in a single solution, then orange juice to mask the sour pungent flavour and make it palatable

I found pregabalin pretty effective for Benzo withdrawal; here's how I did it.

1) Switched fast acting Benzo (Xannie) for Diazepam

2) Taper Diazepam until you reach 10mg/day (depending on your Benzo dosage, this step may take a lot of time)

3) Stop Diazepam, start pregabalin -> 150mg morning/midday, 150mg evening, a total of 300mg/day (if this seems too low, can increase pregabalin evening dose to 300mg)

4) Keep taking Pregabalin for 4-6 weeks, preferably taper it too


Some additional points


*morning dose must be kept as low as possible, esp. if you're a high functioning person (have a job etc.)

*unlike Benzos, pregabalin is beneficial for sleep (positive impact on sleep architecture), hence you can take more at evening/night & interesting/funny dreams

*no need to open caps and take powder; bioavailability is ~90%, if possible don't take right after meal


Regarding librax, I don't understand how taking it will help with Benzo withdrawal since it's a medication which contains Chlordiazepoxide which is a Benzo itself; doesn't sound like a good idea.


Overall, I think pregabalin is a good medication when not abused and used in therapeutic doses (up to 450mg/d); I must say that unlike Benzos, it's effect is pretty "floaty" for a lack of a better word, I think working is better on Benzos.


That's my experience with it; I guess like all meds YMMV.

Seriously you can get high from Lyrica? I've been taking 300 mg every day for years now for fibromyalgia to be honest I never really noticed anything! I'll have to try higher dosage or something I usually mix it with my Dilaudid and ketamine open up a capsule crush up Dilaudid mix it together to make that line stretch. I know some people are really into the Lyrica type meds like gabapentin and others but personally never really noticed too much of a altered state with it might just need an up in my dosage. IMO it always helps to add something in the mix when taking meds to stretch other things so you're not using just one compound as long as they're not interfering with each other and you're playing it safe it helps stretch some medications so you're not rapidly developing a intolerance for one specific compund. I did that with opioids now 100 mg of morphine a day orally doesn't even cut it. Helps a LOT to mix it with other stuff like muscle relaxers benzodiazepines Etc. I try to have a balance with getting high and dealing with pain since I really do need the medication and I don't necessarily always have to get high.

Blown away high. ![:eek:](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f631.png) Dangerously so, imo.

Of course do not mix with anything else in higher doses of pregabalin (or any other gaba drug) I can still get a buzz from 100mg but rarely do I imbibe. @300mg I am sailin. 600mg drunken. 900mg and ya have weekend at bernies content. This is just me, though.

Ya have a tolerance to 300mg for years... dose 600mg and see what ya feel.

We'll keep that in mind thanks for the suggestion sometimes I just end up in withdrawal from other things because I have a hard time getting access to doctors my family sucks and I don't usually get rides to my appointments and trying to save up for a car but difficult with all my health problems. But for sure we'll start saving up more of my Lyrica and get that dosage up and next time I'm experienced any opioid, benzo or ketamine withdrawal I'll add in a few extra that day to see if it combats any of the withdrawal effects and will report back if I experience any unique experiences.


Like always thank you so much and I'll do the best I can to stay safe and you take care of yourself too! Sending positive vibes!

I can give tips and tricks how to quit this evil drug. Was at around 2 grams for 2 months and tapered to 0 in two months with the help of clonidine, propranolol,phenibut, gabapentin and kratom. Taking just the kratom and gabapentin today. I have 0 motivation, life is shit but much better compared to how it COULD have been.

im sure it does skyrocket. havent gotten to that point. dont really want them anymore. 

again i think it has to do with ingesting fractions of mgs than grams to keep "me" right. 

hard sometimes finding exactly what works for a specific "issue(s)". 

docs will throw grams of lyrica at me if i want just not needed atm didnt work well for pains/aches relaxation for me but know that shit will kick a mf ass if abused. both way going in and coming out.

They want to prescribe this one to me for neuropathic pain/fibromyalgia. Not sure yet if I wanna do it or not. They all say it's basically non-addictive, but then I read a lot of people who think otherwise...

Recent blood tests have shown I have reduced kidney function which could be due to me abusing high doses of Pregabalin for the last couple of years.


So I'm giving it a long break.

Good thing or getting it for free every 14 days for 3 years, sometimes I think if the price is just not covered by insurance by employment, maybe I would be free of it!

couple months back when I started loosing feeling or tingling above the knee,(fybro-neuropathic) It started getting real purpose as real help with the some of the pains are gone!

With that in mind skyrocketing tolerance sometimes just go baseline! Who will know with those "gaba-modulators" VGCC or whatevers!


I didn't take any a week last week as I tried to cut back the dosage with Phenibut which is something I do like couple times a year

What happened is that I was like in this loop of Anhedonia but thinking I know a thing or two on all those Gabapentinoids, and what happened is Phenibut this time made 2+2=5, couldn't get the right dose, was vomiting and I think I first time got like manic state where I couldn't have couple straight thoughts I could just call my doc to refill my lyrica but on friday we had the Vukovar comemo day which is national holiday and doc didn't work!


Then on saturday I felt fine took 2gr Phenibut and bam anxiety, boiling blood for the lack of better term, racing heart, I didn't slept 8 hours in total that week just, I lost vitamins, maybe low blood sugar. 


He who walk the road of Gaba-meds knows or can relate with the mad curvy road with CEVS, Oevs, hypnagogia, 


So yesterday I collect myself in the head like lyrica is my demon and saving grace or at least devil I know!

Phenibut is from now a NO-NO in my collection cause side effects are there! with no effects!

Good thing I don't work one more week, I was alone most of the days which was another good thing.

This is something I will need also get looked at, but in my case when I just hold back a little they work like turbo!


Pregabalin is addictive and it work better than any benzo in my case for anxiety made by anxiety meds in the first place and I will deff. continue to take it till it stops working


Baclofen was a long time ago but it was unpredictable also,


Maybe Mirogabalin which should be what like 10x stronger when it hits the market!, till then 

O and I could have change it to gabapentin but my psych said, You can but you won't do any good just will have more side effects, 450 mg Is deff best sweet spot if taken at once with coffee followed by 150mg later for sleep, my circadian rythm is f. so

In my own experience, having been addicted to nearly every substance possible and enduring their withdrawals, lyrica is the one drug I can use for a month or so straight and stop without experiencing severe withdrawals. I felt mildly uncomfortable for a week perhaps, but nothing like opiate or benzo withdrawal. However, everyone reacts differently to various compounds as it’s quite evident that  some have had trouble with withdrawals. 


Lyrica is always in my arsenal of drugs. It’s highly effective for neuropathic pain and anxiety disorders when used in therapeutic dosages. It’s also very recreational when used in higher dosages and combines beautifully with other substances.

In a brief search using Google, Google Scholar, Bing, DuckDuckGo I failed to find ANYTHING. Safe dose ranges, studies, case reports of nothing, but there are warnings of this combination (which seems pretty obvious), including official ones from drug regulation agencies, but usually not backed with any scientifical data, only some wild guesses. In general any evidence about gabapentinoids safety, safe dose ranges, short-term and long-term toxicity, physical dependence potential and withdrawal, and so on, seems pretty scarce, in comparison to, for instance, most benzos. And as I'm now in pretty steep taper from high-dose pregabalin and have to take opioid analgesic (100-150mg codeine tid-qid), I don't really feel safe in this combination.

You will not find such data. These sorts of things are rarely studied in such an explicit fashion (ie, what dose of pregabalin is safe to combine with opioid x), unless said combination is particularly toxic, or the interaction has therapeutic implications (for instance combinations of antiviral medications). This is because, if there hasn't been an especially significant problem with the combination (or if there isn't a potential economic gain knowing the results), no one will fund the research.


Generally gabapentinoids increase the risks posed by opioids to a degree (though significantly less so than benzodiazepines). There is some research on this risk (they defined high dose pregabalin as above 300mg): [https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M18-1136?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub 0pubmed](https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M18-1136?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed)


Essentially you have to evaluate your own risk factors (age, respiratory function, etc) and tolerance to both drugs to assess the risk. This is what also makes such research difficult and unattractive since it is almost impossible to conduct research and conclude, "a safe dose of codeine and pregabalin is X mg and Y mg" since risk factors vary widely, and ignores the phenomenon of tolerance.

I thought i should bring this up, as i don't seem to see it specifically addressed, and i feel like we should because someone could easily dose phenibut with heavy opiates and die.

##### Combining phenibut and opiates?

Does anyone have any experience combining phenibut with opiates, specifically heroin but any true opiate as opposed to kratom? And if so how where the effects? Did you find the respiratory depression to be greater or lesser than with benzodiazepines?   I have combined it with kratom before and I...

That's bullshit. GABAergic euphoria can range from subtle to overwhelming and nauseating, and to say that you must be a druggie n00b if you get euphoria from it is ignorant at best, insulting at worst.

Today I took 900mg pregabalin with 240mg methadone and I feel almost nothing. I have trembling hands and tics in limbs.

Im dissiluniosed with this drug. I take at night to help sleeping and one day a week to potentiate methadone. But  today only feel side effects.

Got this too, at high dosages (<900mg) and then I got a seizure from 1.6g, dosed so high cause I was desperate for a high and the lower dosages didn't do anything anymore. I think this is a warning for seizures to come if you dose any higher.

Yeah, convulsions. Didn't see a doc so Idk what specific kind of seizures it was. I passed out and my girlfriend who was with me said she watched me having convulsions and talking weird stuff. Couldn't walk for two days after this incident and first had some difficulties remembering things so I was afraid of having damaged my brain but thankfully stuff recovered rather quickly.

Hi, for the past 12 days I have been dosing around 900mg. Should I expect some gnarly withdrawals? I won’t have any for 15 days.

I’ve never taken lyrica but I take gabapentin daily, usually exceeding my prescribed dose. 12 days 900 mgs I understand is a lot that is like 2,400-3,000 mgs gabapentin I think (I may be wrong). You should be fine unless you just finished withdrawals from pregablin and restarted for 12 days, in that case maybe. 


It might be uncomfortable at most I’m guessing

Well shit, I ran out of lyrica a few days ago and am concerned customs nabbed my package.  Was shipped from overseas on the 3rd so it can just be the holidays, but usually it’s here in 9-13 days tops. Have had Covid and the lyrica seemed to really help with the body aches, nausea, and appetite, but now I’m having mild lyrica withdrawals on top of Covid.

I felt mildly uncomfortable for a week perhaps, but nothing like opiate or benzo withdrawal. However, everyone reacts differently to various compounds as it’s quite evident that  some have had trouble with withdrawals.

My ability to build up a tolerance to lyrica has been kind of all over the place. I’ve been using it relatively consistently for past couple of years in stints of 3-4 month binges with some breaks in betweeen. Dosages have ranged from 300-450 all the way up to 1200mg daily. Sometimes tolerance doesn’t build too rapidly and goes back down quickly. Other times it seems like it’s the inverse, so it’s been quite of unpredictable in that regard. 


I think it mixes well with all substances, perhaps not in excess with alcohol, but especially with benzos, somas, stimulants (in low dosages), psychs, and dissociatives. 


The past few months I managed to stay below 600mg, but that was mostly due to being in school. Seemed like anything of 300-450 mg would start to inhibit cognition, so I tried to keep in lower range. Now I’m completely out. Usually the withdrawals are pretty mild and manageable for me, but I think the fact that I have Covid is making it more difficult.

I got to the stage where I was using many many grams in one go to achieve that pleasnt trippines effect (something I've never experinces from Benxos). I know that is a crazy amount, but even when I abstain for weeks it doesnt seem to reduce my tolrence for it

A question for those with experience with both or every day users or ex-users. If someone was using this in purpose like daily 450mg pregabalin with occasional benzo in terms of day after lowering dose of pregabalin on 150mg with alprazolam or Lorazepam.

My flatmate tried it yesterday and had no effect at all, very strange drug. I reckon what's going on here is that these euphoric manic-like feelings from pregabalin happen in someone who has a natural bipolar tendency - a tendency towards mania. A personal friend of mine also gets stimulated and manic from it, but she has diagnosed BPD. I myself have BPD too.

I think that these two drug classes are too different to fully substitute for each other. Meaning you'll eventually still get withdrawals but you might get away for some time by cycling. But you'd have to cycle like 3 days on benzos, 4 on pregab, or every second day on the other if you can do that but it sounds messy to me,


Wonder whether RLS drugs like pramipexole or ropinirole would help with the akathisia on days w/o pregabalin.

What dosage did he try?


Without tolerance one should absolutely feel anything of 300mg or more. I knew somebody who couldn't resist the urge to sleep from maybe 250mg. I got a drunken state from 300mg (w/o tolerance) or a dissociative/stimulant/empathogenic like effect from 900mg's.

2.5g a day?

May I ask why this dose is so high, how long have you been on it (at this dose) and the reason why pregabalin was prescribed in the initial decision to Rx?

Thanks and welcome to bluelight.

Will be around a while but others will be along, surely. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

Did you try to use less or to skip a dose and what withdrawal effects did you get?


I was using 900mg/d at the end and quit it without adverse effects. But I know that most people get quite nasty withdrawal from stopping pregabalin.

You can drop fairly quickly to 2000mg and then 1.6g and so on. The hardest part is the same as in buprenorphine: its easy to drop 8mg->1mg but the 1mg to 0 is some tough shit.

This 


This is absolutely accurate 


IME tapering isn’t difficult; the jump off is.  


For example, I had no issue dropping a methadone dose from 80mg to 4mg; and in a different year from 75mg to 6 mg.  The last few mg were the only ones i noticed the drops.


When i had to stop methadone due to long QT syndrome, they switched me to morphine in the hospital.  Knowing no doctor would maintain me with morphine, I requested that they cut my dose in half every 48 hours   


I went from 120 mg per day to 7 mg per day in about a week and a half.  A doctor agreed to write a prescription for the next week so I wouldn’t jump off of 7 mg

I couldn’t jump to 0   Started using small amounts of dope  


Back to your question:  at the mega doses youre taking I strongly suspect you can cut down quickly to a lower dose without much issue  


When you are at “normal” /common dose, you will probably have to go a bit slower, but if I read your question correctly you have only been taking the pregabalin for a few weeks


Therefore it shouldn’t be built up in your system as it would if you’d been taking it for years 


So I really think you should easily be able to just taper quickly and painlessly

Yeah. I was able to taper from 600mg/d morphine to 90mg/d with little discomfort but then it became increasingly difficult. Memantine changed this though, and I didn't have to go through withdrawal. Maybe dissociatives can help with pregabalin taper as well, at least I'd say it would be worth a try if you can get any of the long acting ones, preferrably memantine but also e.g. deschloroketamine or even DXM as a last resort if you can get nothing else but I'd be careful with DXM because of its SNRI activity (and those high trapping dissos are no joke, I know of more than one person who overshoot the dosage and encountered stuff like the devil with eyes open). I never got such eerie stuff from DCK but it helped me to do a cold turkey off 4mg bupe.

I used to take 60 300 mg capsules a day first cut that by half 30 300s enough no wd then did cuts every 4 days until i got to 10 300 mg a day then a slow months long taper until i jumped at 150 mg a day with help of diazepam and it was so bearable i was thinking I'm going to get a wd but it was easy. When i have jumped from massive amounts it was hell

You were taking 18 grams of pregabalin a day, this is not a typo right? Fuck, I got a grand mal seizure from ~1.8 grams. Always interesting how individually different biochemistry is. And glad you made it through the taper.

Oh yeah, pregab's tolerance curve is insane. Worse than any other drug. Back in the day I got sort of a drunkenness from my first 300mg's. Exactly once. Later I'd jump to 900mg and got a dissociative, stimulant kind of effect. Was never able to reproduce these effects even after long periods of abstinence. At last even 900mg did have exactly zero effects so I jumped to 1.8, paid the price and quit the substance. It still pops to my mind every now and then given that it's OTC in the country here but I don't buy more because it's just not sustainable.

Yeah, it's a good aid for opioid withdrawal. Interestingly this effect appears to be there even with tolerance, I was prescribed 600mg/d morphine and 600mg/d pregabalin for months, the pregab had no more noticeable effects for a long time but I could still do a rapid taper of morphine down to around 90mg/d without suffering which I attribute to the pregabalin. It's a weird substance. But I got it prescribed for social and general anxiety and it definitely stopped working for that. The effects I got from my first 900mg's, many years ago, are still under my top 3 drug experiences but could never been reproduced. I just kept taking it because I was afraid of the withdrawal which should prove wrong in the end.


Major side effect I encountered was a fucked up short term memory, I remember watching the newest Spider Man in cinema and couldn't follow the plot because I kept forgetting what just happened. This was on 1.2g if I'm right but even 600mg/d felt kind of stupidity inducing.


Did you get stimulant and/or detached effects from these high dosages?


But I think you're lucky to having survived this high dose habit. My DOC I was primarily abusing were dissociatives (deschloroketamine) and at some point of ridiculously high dosing I began to encounter alarming physical effects, like water retention in the legs, pain in the testicles, eventually stuttering and slightly yellow-ish skin color, I think it could have killed me but I didn't think a second about quitting.

For opium wd it is a miricle pill put it this way day 3 of heroin wd i was on my lorry high on pregabalin rocking to led zeppelin in euphoric mood . The reason i flirt with addiction on them still is because i love the buzzz massive euphoria like a meth or coke high without the edginess on them


Memory is so bad on pregabalin when i was on 60 300 mg i could not recite band members from led zepp or pearl jam and i love rock for a day i could not remember jimmy pages name . 


On those crazy doses i would say anything that i thought of crazy talking shit i felt a really great detached from the world feeling . I feel ashamed now but i once got out of my lorry after a load of 40 ton and thinking how fucked am i . And i would be super horny on them was lucky never to have an accident my joints hurt water on lungs retained water in stomach and my piss would be so foamy . In the mornings i could hear water squishing around my body and my wife got so worried she said when i was snoring it sounded like a death rattle . I thought i would have to spend my life get kidney dialysis my kidney function was low high levels of other chemicals creatine something like that and piss that was reddish color

I personally fall for detached drug experiences, I once worded my natural state as being too 'attached' with permanent worries and anxieties, not the OCD variant where one would check 10 times whether the gas was off but intrusive throughts of similar intensity about all possible shit and specially occasions in my life where I failed to do my best and being emotionally overly sensitive in general. As drugs are notorious for impairing judgement, this became a downward spiral of more drug use leading to more mistakes which I would numb with more drugs. But even when happy I love feeling detached, and dissociatives give that to me. Pregabalin shares some activity with dissociatives, both being Ca channel inhibitors but I read conflicting stuff about that, there's one thread about how pregab was a disso and another one that it wasn't one. Also nobody knows why it has such an unbelievable tolerance profile (at least not to my knowledge). I gave up about pregabalin when I had that seizure, had difficulties walking even just from my bed to the toilet after that for 2-3 days, it's definitely nothing I want to experience ever again. Up to that incident I thought not to get seizures easily because I snorted my way through e.g. at least 10-15 150mg bupropion pills which are known for seizure risk and I got none. In retrospection I was just lucky I guess. I'd rather trade that luck for other stuff in my live though but that's like reversing time, makes good movie plots but impossible in reality.


Would absolutely love though if somebody came up with an analog substance which had a more favorable tolerance curve. This would be a success on the legal highs market for sure.

Not so good tbh, fighting for my life but still I'm getting by. Thanks for asking.

Damn, well yeah good point if you're buying 1k of pills the least thing u can do is test em first. The bad thing about gabaergics is the tolerance, it skyrockets and fades away so fast. After the 3rd day you're doing 5x as much as the 1st day to catch just a mild buzz, oh and the wds are super nasty. They resemble opiate wds alot but don't last as long, crazy cool experience for the books tho. 300g of pregabalin ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png) ![😂](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f602.png)  cheers man

After the 3rd day you're doing 5x as much as the 1st day to catch just a mild buzz, oh and the wds are super nasty. They resemble opiate wds alot but don't last as long, crazy cool experience for the books tho. 300g of pregabalin ![:p](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png) ![😂](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f602.png)  cheers man

The only better thing about the pregab wds are that for me after 7 days of the worse wds i have ever had it just like a switch being flipped its over . First pregab wd i ever had was after taking them for months at high doses i needed relief . I thought i drive to Punjabi butcher to go get ground poppy pods in such torture and just so much anxiety i was crying . I stepped out of my car brought a small box of pods and some water to do a water wash down with as i got out of the shop it was like a miracle the worse of the wd was over and within hours i was back to normal no paws little bit of insomnia but that was it.


Also unlike pregabs for opium wd poium does nothing for pregab wd might take some anxiety away but i found diazepam not big doses 30 mg a day when tapered of pregabs does bring relief . Pregab wds for me make me suicidal the mental torture and anxiety are so bad every opium wd i have had i at least could drag myself out of bed twice a day to shower because showers would be the only time i could get warm but during one pregab wd i could not get out of bed it felt like i was not part of my body i was thirsty as fuck but could not even sit up from bed to drink anything . But i just love the buzz and that's why i buy so many along as my prescription for 600 mg a day i know I'm going to regret it but i think that's months into the future lets worry when the time comes to panic

Ikr, pregab works wonders for opi wd but not the otherway round. The only thing that I've noticed that works for gabapentinoid wds is Ethanol, [@Xorkoth](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/77889/) confirmed this and gave me the reason on a previous post and gave me the explanation. It had something to do with calcium voltage channels or something like that and alcohol has the same effect.

Last time I quit gabapentin, I drank a few beers for a couple days to take the edge off and also tried some DXM(although I'm not sure if this helped at all). After 3 days of drinking, most of the nastier symptoms like the horrible headaches were gone. So I was able to tough it out the remaining days ti complete the week of gaba wds with not much discomfort( funny how gaba wds take EXACTLY a week and then BAM its gone haha). Cheers buddy. xx, stay safe

Look after yourself my brother health before everything. Its the weirdest thing first time i was expecting paws like with opium wd but no once its gone its over but those 7 days from high dosage jumping to people who not been through it its like its only a week but that week is so draining mentally . I much rather come of heroin then pregabs but pods or raw opium that another level of month long wds and months and months of paws

Personally I think this is doable.

If benzos are used for a few days and then pregab a few days there is no dependence or severe tolerance building.

They are different classes of drugs and affect different brain receptors in different ways. If both can be used to treat whatever it is being treated then this may well work out in a fortunate way.

Just my opinion being Rx-ed pregab and self medicate with benzo.

Personally I never had WD's from Pregabalin. Even after a year of using 225 mg a  day.


Benzo' s will cover any possible WDS imo, but are way more adddicting.

Not everybody is susceptible to pregabalin withdrawal. I was on 600mg for many months then even increased to 900mg/d, stopped cold when I didn't get any more effects and got away with it. I guess we're lucky as we have so many reports of strong withdrawals.

yea was on pregabalin solo 600 mg but then overnight the doctor stopped prescribing it and i didn’t have any significant withdrawal either, only the kratom seemed a little weaker but i just can’t cope without bromazolam at the moment and with the pregabalin it helps me to take a little less im prescritpted 2x 225mg/day. pregabalin is really weird when it comes to withdrawls.

I wonder whether Kratom helps with pregabalin withdrawal because I was taking that too during the time when I quite pregabalin. I didn't think about it, Kratom was fairly weak for me but who knows.

And a wonderful weekend to you, too. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I dose bromazolam 3 times daily at around .2mg per dose. 

If I dose kratom I pretty much forget about the brom with no issues.

Been on this brom for close to 8 months I think. Started at maybe 1-2mg per dose a few times a day. It was a mistake as my info was wrong regarding the volume of solvent used and the weight of brom that went into it. Once I realized this I started dropping doses quickly to get under 1mg a day max.

Rx does stand for prescribed. 

I took 100mg pregab yesterday afternoon and by 8pm I was asleep like nobody's business and slept great. Skipped night dose of brom and will wait til noon to dose today as I feel fine.

Lots of remodeling going on in wife's building and we were shifting things around and found a small container of phenibut faa and downed it so I could trash the container... maybe a gram of it (don't have scales here). This (from personal experience) will stretch any substance I may add for the day... it'll take about 5 hours for the phenibut to start to kick in.

yeeeah, my first time with phenibut was really the best feeling ever, but after a few times it didn't work so well for me and triggered a strong rebound. Unfortunately I never had faa, that should be nicer again because of sublingual. thanks for your answer that gives me hope with the brom taper ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) all the best to you!

It took a while for me to find the right dose for my needs/wants but when I did; wow. 

I found using phenibut every third day will produce consistent and sustainable effects. These days I may dose once a month maybe twice... depending on what's going on.

Do you have enough brom to do the slow taper?  May not need being said but these gabapetinoids have a notorious way of building tolerance quickly.

It certainly can be *done *but is it worth*?* While tolerance and physical dependence might be lowered somewhat by mix and matching those two, a whole plethora of problems of poly-drug (ab)use comes into play that way and I would recommend people to stick only with what they are prescribed.

-4 months later and I with the help of psychedelics and one mdma session and a lots of quality weed some dissos. I don't need benzos as a matter of fact I have lots of them just sitting there 2 months not using them and well alcohol and benzos never made kindling now with Kratom 2weeks without buprenorphine! 

-only Kratom tried 2 days ago or 3 asked xoroth for advice, Thank him

-phenibut or f-phenibut helped with pregabalin lowering so now there are no inter-dose withdrawals cause I have spare

-only for pregabs will see cause it helps with my backpain and whatever is causing my acl surgery knee from 2017. and arthrtoscopic meniscus same leg first 2010. to not feel quadriceps and my right ass 

-meaning there is no feeling except sometimes when sleeping like it gets on fire and the only thing is for it to stop is just move the leg which is funny and said to 3 docs without some more knowledge but here in CRo all are covered with insurance when working so they sometimes forget Hipokratic oath and those new ones selling their MRI-s, CT-s, or EMNG-s are still expensive like hell cause they won't get back their profit in couple years now and that is scandal here 

but that is another story

I've been reading some posts in this thread and I'm really concerned about my use of Lyrica. They prescribed it to me a long time ago, maybe 6 years, today I took 1200mg and I feel relaxed... I have a cocaine abuse problem that I have been maintaining for about 8 months in doses of more than 1gr per day. How fucked up can my brain and my body be, if we add to that my use of ketamine, tramadol and mdma, I can simply think of a very early death... April 1st is my 24th birthday... I don't want to live anymore .

Important thing is how fuck up do you feel?


1g is still within limits of “normal” doses and it’s not that damaging but I can imagine it’s a hard habit to kick at high doses after many years which isn’t reason to not try it, at least to lower dose and make a use of “brightens” it brings..

I was so fucked up before. But I feel worse than ever, controlling my impulses and consumption, in addition to my very dark way of seeing life. Saying 1gr of coke is to give an example... during the weekdays, weekends are triple of that. in addition to the multiple binges in the last few months... today I did not consume, here I am seeing what else I can sell, to this I mean. It's bullshit.

How long are you doing coke? I was on multiple grams daily for half a year - year.. One of worst mistakes of my life.


You’ll feel much better when you stop, and stopping it isn’t easy but WD’s aren’t really bad and cravings can be sorted out in a plethora of ways.


Your not fucked up for good, I guarantee you! Hell, you are still young enough to discover whole new levels of fucked up, and that’s good, that’s life! While you fall you gain a lot of momentum and fall trough the lowest point and pop back up on top...doesn’t sound logical but neither does superpositioning and loads of things...but they just are...

I know the feeling. Almost killed myself and managed to properly fuck up my life cuz I WANTED IT SOOOOOOOOOOO MUCH. But I tell you when you ditch it, it’s not like with benzos where WD’s last for months, possibly years or like with opiates where hell is not that long (well idk about shitty bupe, methadone or fent) but it’s intense and cravings aren’t as strong as with coke in fact but they stay! With coke you push trough initial WD’s and after that avoid places where there’s coke and you’ll manage it, feel better week by week and one day wake up and get trough day without even thinking about it.


Do you snort, smoke or inject it?

I snort it, rarely smoke it. But I feel screwed in many ways, I've also used benzos for years therapeutically. I took a large dose of different drugs now, hoping to feel better without feeling anything...it's stupid and bitter.

I'm sorry for not being able to be optimistic right now, but right now I can't think that I want to continue with everything around me.. everything that happens in my personal life is also a big fucking part of this thing.

THIS!


And whatever it is, it’s life! It’s normal for you and me to reach for (insane amounts of) drugs while our world is collapsing. Is it the best thing, surely no. But it’s far better than killing, raping or watching reality TV..


First think on your list should be getting out of – I can’t get high hell… I thought about making thread about it. About all the drugs with which you can reach that hell. But in most, if not all cases, you can rather easy get back to high as a kite hell and than drop toward somewhat sober life… Some time far in the future? Somewhere far from your continent? Doesn’t matter, you are high so kite will drift far far away..and it’ll become a good ride once again, even if for a moment, it’ll be a glorious moment.

Hey. I have been taking lyrica at doses of 225-525 mg for six months. I have been on lyrica 1-3 times a week and there have been weeks in a row where I have only taken it once a week and then there have been weeks where I have taken it twice and a few times I have taken it three times a week and I have had no withdrawal symptoms other than maybe mood symptoms, but I think I've avoided physical addiction at least for now.

Well if you abuse it and don’t have it prescribed, I guess rather stop than risk problems. How to stop? Well you can just stop without any mambo jambo… And it’s not really a big dose so you shouldn’t feel too bad.

If u have an rx; I found taking a single dose of 150mg every morning to be a good mood boost or generalized Anxiety.


Going down to one dose a day; had zero adverse effects from a subtle intoxication at 300, 450mg doses.


My friend takes a dose every day as well; he uses it for a sleep aid at night.

Better than a(larger) benzo habit as it kinda tickles the same itch as benzos only better if only easy to obtain

sorry but what does the abbreviation rx stand for? apparently a recipe??

I have been taking 150 mg for a few days now and maybe I'll take 75mg for a few more days and stop there. really, I've only been on mostly 300mg a day for a few weeks. (+6 months 1-3 times a week 300-525mg) the life situation is just so difficult with anxiety, even the smallest withdrawal symptoms are scary and of course I want to land as smoothly as possible.

i don't have a recipe but i have enough that i can reduce my dose and not have to go cold turkey

Hello guys. My question is a simple one: does Lyrica have any effect, adverse or beneficial, if taken with Escitalopram? I have recently started taking it with Escitalopram (10 mg), previosly I only used it occasionally, like maximum twice per week, never going over 300mg. 

But recently, I started to notice that its effect are not as they were: I am only able to notice them if I drink energetics or coffee. Blunts help too, but the effect is still fleeting and not as big as it was. 

So is this tolerance, or Escitalopram prevents it from metabolizing or something?

Disco - years ago, I was briefly on both these meds you mentioned. The side effects I experienced was extreme sluggishness when waking up ( which lasted only 20 minutes) & blurry vision for 20 minutes.


Back to the Lyrica thread....


I was just prescribed Lyrica 400mg daily from my pain management doctor. It has been 2 years since I last used Lyrica. I took a 100mg capsule each hour 4 times (12pm, 1pm, 2 pm, 3pm). I could start feeling effects about an hour after the first dose. After all 4 doses I was feeling VERY good. I was very talkative, very productive (kind of a light drunk feeling but not overwhelming), & of course my neck nerve pain reduced to wonderful levels. It was hard to go to sleep, even 8 hours (11pm) after the 4th dose. I also got the serious MUNCHIES!


Overall, a wonderful drug! Very long lasting effects! I realize how the tolerance level builds so quickly, so I may skip a day between doses to save my meds. Having a pain management doctor has its pros and cons as far as getting meds. Some people may judge my titrating Lyrica, but it works for me. I used to even titrate Gabapentin every 45 minutes many years ago. Our Blue light friend Keifer has great info on Gabapentin. I'm even thinking of trying titrating Lyrica every 90 minutes to lengthen the med experience. Anyway, how do you all feel about titrating Lyrica?

If the benzo is bromazolam I have had the same experience.

I fucked up thinking my solvent was 100ml when it was actually 50ml. I was putting 200mg of brom in the solvent and thinking it was 2mg/ml. Nope it was actually 4mg/ml. 

Went into a very unwell state of mind with no inspiration, no energy, no cares for anything and deep depression.

Once I figured out my mistake I dropped doses drastically and saw the light shining again almost immediately and was able to get on with life in usual (for me) fashion.

Maybe it is time to drop dose levels? Not berating but this will undoubtedly (IMO) give some relief from the stagnation it seems you are experiencing.

Be well and try to get back to a brighter place, please.

Most welcome.

My doses are at maybe .1mg at noon and before bed (twice a day). Takes some serious dedication I know to get a grip on benzos but it can be done and you can do it for sure.

I just cut out 1/5th of dosage a couple days ago so kinda waiting on the effects of the drop but not dwelling on it. If it wasn't for the superior muscle relaxing properties of the RC I really feel that I could just quit them now without issue.

For perspective I started my doses at around 2mg three to four times a day by mistake and trying to keep back issues in check and being a general dope fiend was pleased with the anxiety relief. Turned on me quick and left me in the lurch. If I recall correctly I dropped doses by a third to see if withdrawals would kick in... they did not. It was only when I started getting below .5mg in dose that I started feeling withdrawals and raised it slightly until stable. Waited a couple weeks and started dropping again slowly. It seems to me that I would not feel any real issues until a week after dropping doses so would stay at the lesser dose for three weeks before dropping again. I also feel that bromazolam can accumulate and linger for a lot longer than other benzos but this is just my take on it.

About where are you as far as doses and how many times a day?

I have been on lyrica 1-3 times a week and there have been weeks in a row where I have only taken it once a week and then there have been weeks where I have taken it twice and a few times I have taken it three times a week and I have had no withdrawal symptoms other than maybe mood symptoms, but I think I've avoided physical addiction at least for now.

Well,you have taken high doses but you were smart enough to not take it EVERY Day ![👍](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f44d.png)![💪](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f4aa.png). If you want to stop completely like your post sounds, just do it, i guess youl be fine, just keep some at hand just in case ( + a few benzos if you can) and let us know how it went. You can do it!!

I just went through a big benzo taper and pregabalin helped alot, just had to really take care not to trade one addiction to the other. Only abused pregabalin in the beginning with +1200mg upwards. For me,i noticed i get the positive effects at lower doses like 400mg morning, 200- 400 mg at night and this avoided the sideeffects i had on higher doses like sweating, weicht gain cuz always hungry and it stores water in body,dont know how that called in english. Good luck ![👍](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f44d.png)

No,i dont think so. Your smart to pause a few days with pregabalin. 2 days without always brought my tolerance down to nearly Zero. I know its nice with beer. 

With a few beers, good opie dose oral and weed had me melt into the Couch, unable to get up and if,not able to walk straight. 

Alcohol is a heavy beast, much respect 2 you and much ![💪](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f4aa.png). You can do it.

No, I'm from Finland. Well, I still haven't stopped taking lyrica and now I'm mainly on it at 150 mg a day and some days I've taken 225 or 300 mg once - twice a week. I'm in line for rehab because I can't seem to stop this. Fortunately, I have kept my dose relatively low and have been using it daily for about two months. At the same time for the last month I have also been taking 1mg clonazepam or 1mg depot alprazolam almost every day but last week I only took 1mg clonazepam in total and now they have run out except I have four 1mg depot alprazolam but at the moment I don't feel like I have benzo withdrawal symptoms.

no need to rush taper slowly if you need 

If you feel that somedays are just from my experience, like time fly fast and before sleep I would be like "o i didn't take any today and worked fine" but the reason that I remembered is back pain and pissing a lot of the same thing as 90% go unchanged through you, me everybody as I understood" feel free to correct me If i'm wrong on this.


Don't rely to much on 2 most intense benzos apart from RC's, as they don't do much on pregabalin withdrawal! and that is one another addiction

So sorry I haven't red all posts you are trying to quit pregabalin?

L-theanine helps

Beta-alanine helps 

Taurine helps 

A lot of vitamines and minerals as first phase when jump or CT or lowering by 200% will make you pee like:

I lost like 3-5 kg just stoping phenibut and after lowering pregabalin to a point that now I take once or twice a week when I need it and tolerance is here the same

As for kindling, that I think never happened to me because it eat reverse every benzo withdrawal was lighter than previous because I was prepared as you can be and anyone, you know what to expect, comfort meds et cetera....


But job that I now work helped a lot as that is something I also enjoy, well 50% of the time but that is something, no overthinking or browsing pregabalin through various forums

Howdy!


TLDR;

These capsules taste like paint, anyone else noticed this with this particular brand? Does anyone know why? 


Please skip to "NOW" if u dont care about the prelude of my question.


I got a few blisters of pregabalin capsules by the brand NERVIGESIC from the DN (The 300mg, red and white with "signature" printed on them).

I have ALOT of "experience" with these as they basically are the only ones available on the black market going back a few years now. 

I used to get pfizers with the "300" printed on them before they disappeared but thats neither here or there.


I normally just buy the preg powder/crystals "straight up" as it is cheaper, plus I noticed a while back ago that the amount of pregabalin in the signature capsules can vary from everything between 260-320mg (majority contain 300mg on the spot though).


So my source was out of "loose" powder and only had the nervigesic product available and my stash was running low, so I bough 4 blisters (60 capsules). 

I wanted to compare the loose powder I had left to what was inside the signature capsules. For some reason the signature capsules cant be opened, the two parts are "locked" or "stuck" together (probably to prevent people from opening them and putting something else in?). Anyway I took a pair of very tiny scissors and tried to gently cut the capsule open but when i cut into it, it exploded and let out a white cloud of pregabalin. I took the 250mg of preg that was left and compared it to my other powder and it looks and tastes pretty much the same.


I usually take pregabalin by mixing the powder with some coffee or energy drink because I feel like it hits faster that way. 


NOW:

I decided to lick the capsule in one spot until the gelatin got soft enough to cut into without having it explode again and noticed a very strong, chemical taste. It straight up tastes like paint (to me).

I have noticed that they have an unpleasant taste before when I for example put one in my mouth and realize I dont have anything to drink and have to swallow it "dry" but I have never basically been sucking one before..


I decided to do some "research". 

I took an empty Elvanse (Vyvanse) capsule that is colored orange and blue, sucked on that and it had 0 taste (or flavor if u will) 

I did the same with a Omeprazole capsule (colored light blue and white) and again, tasted nothing.


Then I dropped the signature capsule in a glass of water and observed it for a few minutes, then repeated the same thing with the other capsules.

They all behaved the same. They expanded and turned into a fragile, gross and slippery version of themselves. One exception was that the signature capsule immediately "let of" the red coloring into the water, I could see the red color leave the capsule BEFORE turning the water to a reddish color. The red part of the capsule was still as red as it was before dropping it into water several minutes later though. 

With the other capsules the water just changed color over time but I could not see the color leaving the capsule. 


Are they maybe (probably) fake and coated with some shit or made out of some cheap, unhealthy shit?


It says that they are made in India. I heard most Hindu people are vegetarians and did some research on HPMC (vegetarian) capsules. 

Some articles say that HPMC caps contain or affect some enzyme that affect the bio-availability in certain substances?


So should I avoid swallowing the capsules?

Or.. this is a stupid thought but, maybe that chemical taste is something that is supposed to be there? to help absorption or something?


To anyone sitting on the same product as me, can you please lick one of them shits and report back to me if yours also taste weird?

To anyone reading this, can u please check if u have some medicine in capsule form and check if they taste anything? everything I have at home is tasteless except for these signatures.


thank you for reading, I tend to write a frikkin essay just to ask the most basic question. I dont know what condition this is a sympton of, I refuse to go to a doktor, they have only made my life worse if anything..   


Oh and one final thing. The blisters say to not chew the capsule. If that means anything.

Is it water soluble if your really concerned  could hypothetically maybe just drop in a bunch of water mix poor off the liquid or maybe filter with a paper towel then wash that down with a second glass of water that way your not exposing your mouth and throat to to as high concentration of chemicals and the second glass might help the throat go quickly back to clean and normal. And no capsules vs toilet paper which I assume could get stuck in your throat and open up esp dry swallow. 


Idk just an idea not. A doctor lol

the stuff I have right now is a mix of water soluble powder and crystals that are not water soluble (if the crystals are crushed they become water soluble). It might sound sketchy but I have seen LYRICA straight from a pharmacy look and behave exactly the same. sometimes it comes in 100% powder, there was a period when it came in 100% crystals. it all smells and tastes the same tho. when crystals are ingested they just have a longer onset. sometimes I buy empty gelatin capsules, crush the crystals in a "mortel". when crushing the crystals I can really smell that cotton candy smell. 

overall I actually like the powder/crystal mix because when ingested, I start feeling a slight buzz after like 30-40 minutes from the powder and the crystals come into play like 60 minutes later.


Crushing it into fine powder and putting into capsules is a lot of work but it definitely hits the hardest, and is probably the healthiest way.

I have noticed the lower dosed capsules (75-150mg) always contain fine powder while the 300mg always contain some crystals (sometimes only crystals)


Like I said earlier I have a years of experience when it comes to the pregabalin itself ![:p](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png) . I just have a weird feeling about these capsules ATM.

I wish I could post a link. I just found an article where "terrorists" in mexico got caught with several millions in drugs and there are pictures with literal MOUNTAINS of nervigesic pregabalin boxes

I don't live in the U.S though so luckily that is not my stuff lol. :D


I feel bad for american drug users that never know when stuff is contaminated with fent.. over here fentanyl is IMPOSSIBLE find and if u find it, it is not worth the ridiculous price. So yeah, there is zero chance of something being "cut" with fent over here because that would make no sense economically for the dealer ![:p](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)


I apologize for rambling, Im currently surfing on a mix of preg,sub,beer, and speed :/ ![:p](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)


Oh and the ROA you suggested is exactly the way I do it lol. When I parachute stuff I swallow the paper ball and poor a waterfall of liquid directly after swallowing.

1200mg is a lot.  As far as tolerance goes, it depends on how long you've been taking it.


1200mg is still a lot with a tolerance, maybe start with 300mg and redose if you feel like you need to (lyrica is pretty good about redosing).


You can always take more, friend; you can never untake drugs though.

I've taken a lot of gabapentin (prescribed @2400mg/day for 10+ years off and on) and a fair amount of pregabalin, and gabapentin has 100% lost all of it's magic to me; I take it mostly at prescribed doses for anxiety.  Even when I've taken breaks from it, it's *nowhere near* as good as those first few times, or even first few months; I would have to take upwards of 6g over the course of like 5-6 hours to get any kind of buzz from it these days, unfortunately.  


Pregabalin on the the other hand is still a pretty good time at 600mg for me, but still not comparable to the first few times.


I guess to an extent that's every drug right?  


Maybe it's because I've been harder on my GABA receptors, but the development of tolerance and "loss of magic" associated with GABAergics compared to other drugs is WILD to me.  


Once again, it may be just me. idk

No, it just works on some of the same receptors.

I used to get a subtle, but nice euphoria from it and a little bit different of a head space.


I know that regardless of how much I take, or how I stagger it, I will never again get that out of it.


I think I get what you're saying with "dirty", especially compared to pregabalin, but DXM has a pretty high affinity for lots of different receptor types/multiple mechinisms of actions and is also *highly* dose dependent; I think this is generally what is meant by "dirtiness".

No point in snorting pregabalin as it has a very high oral bioavailability, and is rapidly absorbed following oral adminisration.

Dear All

Is there any other drug other than pregabalin or gabapentin that gives the same euphoric effects and can be obtained easily?


Thanks

You may want to look into Phenibut hcl. It works on both the Gaba A and Gaba B receptors in the brain. Here is a megathread that should have all the info you need: [https://bluelight.org/xf/threads/ph...-and-usage-guide.804928/page-19#post-15728994](https://bluelight.org/xf/threads/phenibut-10-years-experience-a-comprehensive-long-term-synopsis-and-usage-guide.804928/page-19#post-15728994)

Gabapentin and pregabalin both work on **voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC), **and I'm unaware of any other substances that are the same in this regard.


Phenibut has two mechanisms of action; it works on both VGCC and GABA-B dose dependently, so there are definite similarities.


Baclofen may be an option for you.  It's a GABA-B agonist, and although I'm unsure whether it works on VGCC, but anecdotally I can tell you that baclofen has in the past given me some significant relief from gabapentin withdrawals.


GHB is also a GABA-B agonist, I'm not sure whether it's availalbe where you're at, but at this point I'm kind of grapsing at straws here.

Thanks for recommending .GHB is illegal and banned. Anyways I have tried  Gabapentin and pregabalin is pretty much the same. Baclofen is fine not that great though.

if you you ever find anything that can give similar effects please keep us posted. i live in a country where we can get most pharms that are not opiates but heavy laws on illegal drugs so im often searching for recreational pharms but now im just horribly addicted to pregabalin and starting to slowly start a tapering plan

Pregabalin is used to produce relaxing GABA effects it is not producing at any dose or I might have messed up my gaba level by having too much GABA. Please help. Pregabalin used to produce effects like benzo before but now it does not produce at any dose.

How long are you leaving between each dose (days, weeks)? It won’t produce much if any recreational effects if used every day in my opinion, although the therapeutic effects would still be there.

I take Pegabalin raw powder near daily….for over a year. 300-600mg on an empty stomach STILL produces potent anxiolytic effects similar to a benzo 


Valium 10mg tablets…..300+ of them…..and a single phone call, another 300+ 


Diazepam & Diclazepam. Two of the most useful benzodiazepines on earth (Delorazepam & Lorazepam are active metabolites of Diclazepam) but genuine Valium has unmatched muscle relaxant properties and a potent anxiolytic 40-60mg for a 240 lbs man on an empty stomach 


Pregabalin (Lyrica) MUST be taken on an empty stomach …..1 to 1.5h full onset & peak serum levels 90% oral  bioavailability. After a large meal …..4-6 hours is onset & peak serum levels …make a huge difference

Yes, benzodiazepines do indeed act on the GABA (Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid) receptors in the brain. Specifically, they bind to a particular subtype of GABA receptor known as the GABA-A receptor. When benzodiazepines bind to these receptors, they enhance the effect of GABA, which is an inhibitory neurotransmitter. This enhanced GABA activity results in sedative, anxiolytic (anti-anxiety), anticonvulsant, and muscle relaxant effects.


Pregabalin also has an effect on GABAergic neurotransmission, although it does so indirectly and via a different mechanism. Pregabalin binds to a protein known as the alpha-2-delta subunit, which is a part of voltage-gated calcium channels in neurons. This binding reduces the release of certain neurotransmitters, including glutamate, noradrenaline, and substance P, among others. Although it doesn't bind directly to GABA receptors, the net effect of pregabalin also results in reduced neuronal excitability, and it is used for some of the same indications as benzodiazepines, such as anxiety disorders, epilepsy, and neuropathic pain.

To reverse the effects of excessive GABAergic activity, such as in cases of benzodiazepine overdose, healthcare providers often administer a medication known as flumazenil. This medication is a selective GABA-A receptor antagonist, meaning that it competes with benzodiazepines (and other GABA-A receptor agonists) for binding to the GABA-A receptor but does not activate it. By doing so, it can effectively block or reverse the sedative effects of benzodiazepines, but it must be administered with caution and under medical supervision due to risks like precipitating seizures, especially in individuals with a history of benzodiazepine dependence or other complicating factors.

I currently don't know anyways to increase the effects of pregabalin or any other GABA reuptake inhibitors, however potentiating medication like pregabalin or GABA reuptake inhibitors could lead to serious side effects, including but not limited to dizziness, drowsiness, difficulty breathing, or even life-threatening conditions, result in unpredictable interactions. I'll let someone else answer who has had success of potentiating pregabalin. You can try mixing pregabalin with substances like alcohol or opioids to potentiate its effects, but be warned, it can be extremely dangerous.

 You could also consider taking substances that stimulate your nervous system, like amphetamines or certain nootropics, to counteract the effects of excessive GABA. But keep in mind, it's a risky path with potential consequences for your health and sanity.

You can explore nootropics that stimulate your central nervous system and counteract excessive GABA. Here are a couple of options to consider


1. **Modafinil:** This wakefulness-promoting agent can increase alertness and energy levels without directly affecting GABA. It's available in some places without a prescription.
2. **Phenylpiracetam:** This nootropic is known for its stimulating effects and could help balance out excessive GABA activity. It may not be readily available in all regions, so you might need to look for sources.
3. **Adrafinil:** Similar to modafinil, adrafinil can provide wakefulness and alertness, potentially helping to offset excessive GABA effects.
4. **Flmodafinil:** This is a more potent derivative of modafinil, which may have a stronger stimulating effect.
5. **Noopept:** While not a direct stimulant, some users report increased mental clarity and focus with noopept, which could help counteract the sedative effects of excessive GABA.
6. **Phenibut:** It might sound counterintuitive, but phenibut can stimulate certain aspects of cognition while still acting on GABA receptors. However, it can be addictive and have withdrawal symptoms.
Remember, acquiring and using these substances may still come with risks and consequences, so proceed with caution, or not, it's up to you. And they may not be readily available or legal in your area. Proceed at your own discretion.

The thing about this gabapentinoid is it build tolerance really fast and if taken daily/regularly chances are you will be at 900mg in a week or less.

My normal dose that is effective is 600 mg otherwise if I take 300 mg the high gets over quickly but before I had zero tolerance Even If I took 300 mg or 150 mg it used to work like 600 mg but now even 600 mg gets over quickly. Now it has stopped producing its GABA effects. all of a sudden it stopped working.

In that case there are a couple options:

Raise the dosage yourself (I would add 100mg only for starters), taper down the dosage that you are used to to drop tolerance or just taper off and be done with pregabalin.

Not much else to offer re: suggestions so maybe someone else comes along and offers something I am not thinking of. 

Maybe find a different drug to treat whatever it is that pregabalin is being used for... even just for a while.

I've been on Pregabalin for years, the name says it all, "Pre" Gabalin, it's an gaba analogue, but it doesn't effect the gaba receptor at all, it binds to the alpha 2 Delta receptor. Zero gaba affinity, I read some people say indirectly it does, yes, but that would be just as much as when I'm laying in the sun in my backyard with my dog at my side. Pregabalin was not invented as an anxiolytic chill pill, at higher doses is actually quite the opposite resulting in somewhat manic effects, like feeling energetic and having problems acting relaxed lacking control to relax in conversations almost like people on mama or powerful stimulants. When combining Pregabalin with an gabanergic substance like benzodiazepines these manic effects get even more powerful, and  when combining with baclofen, you'll can actually get so high that it feels extremely similar to ghb, this last combo will even take extreme Ghb withdrawal effects 100% away  instantly.

It surely does imitate the effects of GABA but tolerance killed all it effects.

These receptors indeed have similarities, and the alpha 2 Delta receptors do work more closely together with gaba receptors than Dopamine or serotonin, and that's what I try to state with my previous message, there are so many more receptors and neurotransmitters than those we most of us know about, simply because people are barely aware or their existence or not at all. Gaba and α2δ bound to each other closely but like brother and sister, closely related but with different behavioral mechanics. I've been prescribed Pregabalin for over 6 years and just quit taking it a few months ago, they do have anti anxiolytic effects but instead sedative effects such as certain gabanergic meds,  Pregabalin acts more like a mood stabilizer/uplifted, that why in high doses people actually experience traits of Mania, in most cases people experiencing significant effects are usually on dosage that's to high (except recreationally xD) therefor I can imagine that it can scare some people because they loose some control over themselves. I dingen mind it but the people around me did notice my enhanced enthusiasm and hyperactivity at the point inwas dosed to high, which is something I didn't like being aware off.

That depends on the reason you need it? You're afraid you damaged your gaba receptors right, how come? Benzodiazepines stop working for everybody within a couple of weeks or months.


What I do know is when we use certain medications who force control over certain area's in the brain like receptors, those receptors can indeed get damaged, but most likely they get lazy before they get damaged, our brain luckily is very flexible and can heal, reactivate and build new synapses which takes time. And yes there are things that can speed up this process, for example the Mushroom Lion's mane, it doesn't give psychoactive effects but it's a powerful full with agonistic traits on certain adrenaline and dopamine receptors. Let me give you an example If a person took benzodiazepines for a long time it can effect certain receptors like norepinephrine (noradrebaline) and makes it lazy because the benzodiapines didn't provide much of a reason to do it's job, so when a person quits the benzodiapine this receptor need to learn how to work again resulting in over activity, over activity of norepinephrine which results I an increase of cortisol (stress hormone) which can lead to depression etc. When something in the brain is effected by a substance it starts to effect many other mechanisms that are not gabanergic for example, time is an very important factor that the brain needs to balance itself out when sudden changes happen and it's not always necessary to counter it with another substance. 


Lions mane, can be bought as growkit and is a good tasting mushroom with lot's of proven benefits that accelerate the process you are looking for. Here is a link, about its effects on depression but this is just one of the many traits it can benefit. Stay away from the powdered capsules they are very inefficient compared to the fresh lion's mane mushroom.

If something isn't done soon one will find oneself in the lurch to be crushed beneath the wheel.

The harder you chase those gaba effects the worse it will become.

I suggest cutting back usage to lower tolerance but so far we are adding to the issue of tolerance by inducing another drug to bring back those nice feelings.

Look... not judging In any way just shootin from the hip from many experiences with many substances. There just are no short cuts in life. 

I only hope the best in this situation as I always root for those of my ilk... we just misunderstood. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

Pregabalin Is strong downer with relaxing effects but if i don't take benzos with or without it Its not completely make my body relaxend or my brain carefree. Definitely only low pregabalin effect caned sa a result of other mechanisms.

I just used pregabalin 600 mg for five years and never had issues. I recently just used clonidine .3 for sleep with pregabalin and then I started having tolerance issues. Other than pregabalin I never really used any other substance. been on and off Benzo but only for let's say short periods of time maybe like once in three months.Thanks for your reply.

I looked up Clonidine, and what receptors and it binds too. I think it's safe to say combining it with pregabalin is resulting in the effects i described earlier when combined with other meds like Benzodiazepines and Baclofen, and in that case i think you are right about what you experience. 


I was on Pregabalin for 6 years, but I quit because it case braindamage, I was experience well know and proven side effects like forgetting words multiple times a day. Long term usage of pregabalin can result in Alzheimer, just like benzodiapines can. Your also on the max dosage used when a doctor would prescribed this medicijnen, 600 MG a day is only given to people to battle pain case by nerf damage or epilepsy, the ma, dosage for anxiolytic effects is 450 MG a day. People should not compare its effects to benzodiapines as this drug only makes you feel high during the first days after that it should fade away making the med do it's job without intervering to much with your cognitive functions like benzodiapines do. This is the reason I quit the drug completely and I believe this drug shouldn't be prescribed for longer than maybe 2 years. Long term damage resulting in Alzheimer and memory impairment is also well studied in Benzodiazepines especially when taken on a daily base and the dosage. My advice would be to quit this stuff. 


I was able to quit within a week, and at day 1 I dropped from 3x 450mg a day to one dosage of 150 mg 2 hours before bedtime. The withdrawal effects aren't as bad as some people claim, 150 before bedtime is plenty to be able to sleep, after 4 days I dropped to 75 MG before bedtime and I quit after a week.


I'd also like to share that I'm not against chemical meds, but the Lion's mane mushroom studies shower significant effects in cognitieve improvement and binds to a brought spectrum of receptors, a lot of superfood claims are bullshit simply as a business model.. good news this isn't  the case with Lion's mane, studies showed its very effective in combating the damage caused by Benzodiazepines, Gabapentinoids, and similar substances. It's also easy to grow with a kit, the fresh mushroom can be fried and than stored in the freezer, and it's best taken with your breakfast (omelet or whatever) and before drinking coffee. 


I'm very tired and my writing ATM is a bit all over the place apologies for that (Im Dutch). Feel free to ask me anything. I can only say my life improved since I quit taking antidepressants, pregabalin occasional lorazepam and introduced Lion's mane, which btw also has positive anxiolytic  effects ![😉](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

I definitely have trouble thinking. It is exactly how you described it. I will slowly taper down because I think I am going through withdrawal and tolerance is just messing up. I  used dxm with pregabalin recently I heard it stops the development of tolerance which it did but makes a small difference. I have checked Lions Mane and I am going to order it. You understand gabaergic drugs way better Many people did not understand what I was asking you understood.

I just listed all GABA analogs 


GHB is a member of the family. Google it. Gabapentinoids and/or GABA analogs and on Wikipedia you’ll see a pic of all these molecules and GHB is there 


Gabapentin 

Pregabalin

Phenibut

Baclofen 

GHB

GABA (which is unable to cross the BBB as a supplement. Adding a Phenyl ring to its molecular structure gives you Phenibut)

How’s everyone doing from this last post in May?


My usage has went up and down the past while, mixing with other substances (Taps and Diazepam) which is def not recommended. Only two I can take together is the Pregabalin and Diazepam - and the benzo in low doses like under 40mg.

Can one just dump the powder from the capsule and consume it? I mean if it is the capsule causing the issue do away with it. The capsule has no merit in the pharmacology of the drug within.

Can anyone else chime in here? You can do it with other medications and mix it with like purée type food so I don’t see why not this (but please don’t take my word for this particular one - plus you’re still taking the fillers too from the med).


Also I’ve never done this and take the capsules as is.

No, what is the point?, that is almost like chasing the Dragon you will spike your tollerance even higher or you will binge on high doses couple of days and than diminishing returns, or mental why did I do it?  


you will stretch your supply and achieve nothing if you take more on the job.

So you can try with maybe anoter 300mg or even higher if you know what you are doing meaning tollerance, don't drive, don't take another downers or if you go in that seizure mini jerks state take 5mg diazepam If you work with people try to forsee that manic state that can come with higher dosages so if you feel ok

Don't take another dose, If you feel uncomfortablle on 600mg, you shouldn't if you are nor addicted to very high dosages?


pregabalin in sweet spot and if you know where you at with meditation, or astral projection can put me in a very let's say that sometimes helps when you find another way of using med that is prescribed to you and that gose with a lot of side effects to tunnel it for expanding your awareness


patterning was somethinh I saw and could never express to anyone and it's only with pregabalin and Phenibut moreso Phenibut withdrawals that are like these forceful entries to seeing these energies or glutaminergic storm, that creates gut inflamation where well with substance abstinence chemistry of brains and body's is showing some interesting colors and patterns that I saw cause I was glued to a TV while I was in those withdrawals


Btw sorry for a little navigational turn in topic but I think there are some of you out there that experienced these and that is only with Gabapentinoid type withdrawals not benzo as much just Baclofen, GBL-H, Phenibut and pregabalin as gabapentin


stay safe and wait till you are done with work mate and then enjoy at home with another dose, you will stretch your supply and achieve nothing if you take more as you will get more from enjoying the dose from home.

I'm not at work? I'm sat at home watching TV. And as i already stated i'm not using daily or addicted to this drug. I just enjoy sometimes having something to chill. I am trying to avoid benzos and other drugs.

You've had 3000mg in the last 2 hours? Surely that's getting a bit ridiculous dose wise.


Anything more than 600mg a day just started to seem quite pointless to me. Like it wasn't adding anything good to the experience.

I concur once i got above 600mgs i started to get these weird side effects that really took away from the experience and made it less enjoyable. Ive found that Pregabalin should only be used one day a month in around a 600mg dose and doing so provided such a euphoric high, one of my favorites.


 But even after just second day on it the magic is so much less its just not even worth it, kind of makes it anti-abusable to a degree. Was thinking about ordering another 10g of powder soon, really miss it i havent taken any in like 6-8 months if i had some now it would surely be amazing. Really loves mixing it with FXE, it was incredibly euphoric.

Yeah I was mainly doing it for the anxiolytic effects as they’re more pronounced in higher doses but the main effects diminish after 1500mg or so for me. 


Addiction I keep thinking ‘am I’? But I can go for weeks or months without it and then binge it for a while. Hard to pin done this one. Prescribed it twice a day and it does help yeah,  helps with anxiety great.

Thats good and try not to be on it if you can and you do!!

dou you feel any rebound anxiety after?,,,or bettween those binges?


So it help with anxiety than that is the biggest issue that bothers me cause anxiety is hell for me, I was in some heavy pains but anxiety is the thing that makes me incapable of executing tasks, even watch TV I loose concentration......let me just rephrase that all in past sense but you get the point!


pregabalin was intended for pain which is not very very good in that as tinittus and those jerks, later it was I think became GAD mad also, but when taking for years I tend to also loose track but that is like once or two days in a row maybe twice a month break

  otherwise i get very agrressive, than those frickin RLS worse than from buprenorphine, similar to benzos.


But now all may think look again horror story and it is cliche cause there are times I could easily stopped, as also fast tapers only worked on me. slow taper is just torture for what??


So do you take any med inbetween?

Hi all


Can i just ask, has anyone taken Pregabalin with Gabapentin? Whats it like? I take the highest dose of Pregabalin and have built up tolerance. Just wondered if anyone had taken Gabapentin and Pregabalin together and if it can make you feel that happiness and motivation that Pregabalin used to? Or anything else? I cant take opiates as im on Esprinor (from opiate issues). I m getting help and accept that i have issues! Any advice would be helpful, but please be kind! Thank you in advance!

I would say that since Pregabalin in my opinion is very similar in Gabapentin at least in the receptors that they affect. I wouldn't expect you to feel much of anything from the addition of Gabapentin to your Pregabalin regiment as Pregabalin is basically Gabapentin on steroids. I am unsure how tenable it would be for yourself, but the only way that I have found in order to get the magic back is to take a reduced dose of the Pregbalin for a shorter period of time or take a break from it for a little whiles and your body will eventually reset/reduce your tolerance to the compound.


P.S. I think you may have double posted this thread.

Thank you so much, thats great, i really appreciate it! Do you think then that if i took Gabapentin on top of pregabalin not much would happen? Ill have to reduce/have a few days off! Do you know the effect of diazepam on pregabalin because obviously thats a benzo but pregabalin often speeds me up but then gradually makes me really tired. I suffer really badly with anxiety and whilst i am getting to the route cause, i also really need something thats going to help me...not just sedate me!

In regards to combining the gabapentin and pregabalin... I would predict the pregabalin to be more competitive at the same receptor sites as gabapentin, such as VGCCs (voltage-gated calcium channels) and other GABA receptors sites. Since both gabapentinoids target similar receptors I can only forsee that the pregabalin would overshadow the gabapentin's affects. So I wouldn't expect the gabapentin to really do much. I wouldn't recommend combining gabapentinoids with other sedatives such as benzos. Even though these two substances are in different chemical classes and don't exactly target the same receptor sites. They will certainly potentiate one another in terms of 1+1=3. Both pregabalin, gabapentin, and benzos are all sedatives. Combining sedatives can be very dangerous and result in fatal respiratory depression. So caution advised. If you have been taking these for a whiles now you most likely have a tolerance to gabaergics. And if you are attempting to switch from pregabalin to gabapentin there is likely going to be a a cross-tolerance between the two. Meaning that once you have a tolerance to one it's likely that you will have a tolerance to the other. I would recommend tapering any of the substances that you have mentioned above in order to avoid withdrawals and other unpleasant side-effects or adverse affects as you may be either physically or psychologically dependent. 


What other methods or substances have you tried previously to treat your anxiety?


However, what is most important is to identify the cause of your anxiety. Every time you use a substance you are only simply pushing off your symptoms that your suffer from without resolving them.


In terms of anxiety, I have dealt with it extensively so if you would like to talk about it sometime I am here to listen.


Best of wishes!

You'll find no kindness here [@charbucks](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/430290/) ![:p](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)


These two drugs are extremely similar. Pregabalin (Lyrica) is approximately six times the potency of Gabapentin. This would make 100mg Pregabalin = 600mg Gabapentin. Things can become complicated as Gabapentin is highly variable in bioavailability while Pregabalin is not. Assuming you haven't made any serious dietary changes recently, than this is not important.


The big issue here is your tolerance. Gabapentinoids, of which these both are, are notorious for their fast-acting tolerance/dependence. The tolerance to the psychological effects will occur before the physical effects. Most people, myself included will tell you that you have at most, a couple of weeks of good Gabapentinoid euphoria before you start getting hit with rapaciously diminishing returns (taking 50g Gabapentinoid in a single sitting for instance).


For you to have the experience you're looking for, you would have to severely cut back on your daily dosage for a couple of weeks. If you took 3 days off, on the fourth day, you'll have some euphoria etc., but the following day will be 50% as good and the following day you'll basically be right back where you started.


If you went cold turkey; no Gabapentinoids for 4-5 days, you could probably get a few days of euphoria. The main takeaway here is that it's extremely difficult to reclaim that feeling and when you do, it's fleeting at best. The honeymoon period with any drug is always going to be the best. You can never really revisit this time and attempting to do so is usually just a maddening exercise.

I read a different article which I don't feel like chasing down which said that there was a problem with patients combining Gabapentin and Pregabalin since it would give them euphoria(??!!). The horror.

Anyway, I like combining the two (in low dose situations, anyway) and the sum seems greater than the parts. A little greater than the parts. It's kinda like one hits things the other does not.

Nice combo, but nothing to write home to mom about.

Hey sorry if this is off topic kinda… but since you seem to have experience with both… do you think if a person didn’t like the way gabapentin felt, that there’s any chance that pregabalin would be different. I have chronic pain & tried gabapentin a while ago with hopes that it could help …. but really didn’t like how it felt. I’ve been wondering lately if I tried pregabalin if it would be better or I could tolerate it. Some stuff I read seems like they are similar but others say there are differences too. I figured I’d ask someone that has had experiences with both. I wouldn’t blame you if you couldn’t really answer since all our body chemistry’s are different

Maybe. They both can make you feel numb, but Pregabalin feels a little cleaner and more stimulating. Worth a shot anyway.

I agree with pregabalin being 6 times stronger than gabapentin.  300 mgs of pregabalin is my high end these days as is 1800 mgs of gabapetin. I am not sure in a taste test that I could tell the difference if I did not know.  I personally like gabapentin better probably because of low tolerance and what I perceive as a gentler body high than pregabalin.  But if I want to spin my head I reach for pregabalin.  If I want to slightly spin my head and also have a calm body I use gabapentin.


I have been prescribed this since 2016.  Never took daily or even close and I can confirm taking it once a week (or even twice) keeps the effects that I like in tact.  i admit these days I usually only indulge twice a month. I also have a superstition that if I go too long without it the shoulder pain and sciatica I have been given it for will resurface.  But honestly I am very happy I did not take this daily.  It is much better as a utility drug.


Still waiting for that plant we will find in nature where a nice cup of tea made from it feels like gabapentin or pregabalin.  I think all we have seen is synthetic gabapentinoids.  But Nature will produce I am sure.  I can't wait.

I have chronic pain & tried gabapentin a while ago with hopes that it could help …. but really didn’t like how it felt. I’ve been wondering lately if I tried pregabalin if it would be better or I could tolerate it. Some stuff I read seems like they are similar but others say there are differences too. I figured I’d ask someone that has had experiences with both. I wouldn’t blame you if you couldn’t really answer since all our body chemistry’s are different

I have used baclofen, gabapentin, pregabalin, and phenibut. Phenibut I find the most enjoyable. Pregabalin is great, but even if I take it early in the evening I will sleep straight through my alarms. For me baclofen doesn't work without combining it with another substance. When I first tried gabapentin it was phenomenal, but just as [@Keif' Richards](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/161552/) said don't expect those effects to last in the long run without tolerance breaks.


Best wishes!

Am prescribed Mirtazapine same Pizotifen to be taken at night but that's about it. 


Used to abuse benzos but try my hardest not to get them these days. If I stick to Pregabalin then it's all good.


Anxiety kills me, physically and mentally. For example the other day was terrible I was a mess with it. Couldn't focus, couldn't do simple tasks ugh fuck anxiety.

Not being funny but depending on dose it may dampen effects of most things... cept those substances that are suggested *not* to be taken with it.

It's definitely dose dependant imo/e.

I love the effects but know it is not sustainable for recreational purposes.

Be safe, yes?

I never noticed Lyrica blocking caffeine. Had my caffeine today actually, along with some TAK-653, bromantane, and then I had some Lyrica. And some weed too. Coming off of what I think was Covid, and today was the best I've felt in about 5 days. The chemicals helped I think.  ![:ROFLMAO:](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f923.png)

I'm prescribed 75mg capsules. It's fun to dose for a couple days, but you need to take breaks since the tolerance builds. I'll take it and take 2-3 days off and take it again at various doses. But I also take Kratom on days off so it doesn't bother me.

I do as well and take long breaks from gabapentinoids. Pregab once a month maybe and stopped the phenibut way back.

I do enjoy the buzz of a few hundred mgs occasionally. Nice to feel "drunk" and not drink. lol

 Anyway ... thinking it's time for a cig and dose of bnz.

Best to ya.

I can't even imagine those azolam's like clonazolam or bromazolam, as alprazolam is a week thing as oppossed o it!

I hope you are doing fine?? 


So I was those 5 days and 5 days home thinking i can do this I'm a man well, fuck I thought to myself still I don't feel like I would kill myself, but again thought If someone was to walk in and said It's time for you to die and point it in my head I would be like I't must ve been that angels sent you just please do this or give me some drug!


I was convulsing than adding hellish migraine and hearing neighbours watch on the wall ticking seconds I emptyed myself meaning no more vomiting and no more diarrea had some loperamide and come paracetamol with codeine as it's OTC here than went straight to ER drove myself!, I advise not to drive but I had GF sitting next to me, so there they said why the hell you haven't been here 5 days ago?

Why torture yourself as they saw buprenorphine 2mg daily, pregabalin 150,150,300mg daily, xanax xr 2mg 0,0,1? and I said well I tried and I came!

 but was out cold on sunny day, pale face, and there I layed as ER was frickin full of people and in 10 days I had my first seizure there in ER, well I thought I had one mini at home but waiting there for 5hrs to be given 5mg diazepam I said you asked me why I waited and now you but I saw that here there is shortage in good employees, staff like nurses, drs!


They said we don't have pregabalin here and no buprenorphine and they asked me what Should be the best should I stayed there as it was sunday or ? I said just write on paper that pharmacy can give me pregabalin but me paying the full price, which will be given back to me day later when my script went through! That helped!


So to this day I with Ketamine and MXE, with some Kratom powders couple bags of 100g green malay and one or two red vein went zero on buprenorphine and with diazepam when needed I wnet zero on benzos but....


Pregabalin is some shit out of this world i tell you all! I ordered Phenibut HCL as F-phenibut which I saw is fluorinated baclofen as it is but better as I tried baclofen to and it carries shittier comedown or rebound than phenibut..

But I can now go a day without pregabs and next day with 300mg and I cannot always get K as no more Phenibut well I can't find any as Liftmode won't ship it to CRO but even better.


as plumbus here stated

I think Kratom helped as who knows to this day pregabalin is a very strange mofo: we all saw what went down in Ireland or NI Belfast, 


And yeah when i quit pregabalin cold turkey of course i have to take more kratom but i dont remember having any withdrawl from the pregabalin and i was on 600-900mg/day.


Maybe it's my fybro and two surgeries from playing football on my right knee and by back is only better as that tinituss(however it's spelled) as 5th year on pregabalin I think to myself well what the heck? OO and I have 72mg Concerta script for only ADHD on adult as I don't have other mental disorder as my therapist said which is me talking to her 5mins twice in last 36 days she laughed when I told her please don't forget to write on that Concerta script code for ADHD she said OO you have that actually and I said well pharmacist won't gave me if not listed and she wrote it and said deal with that fybro with orhoped and go to another MRI's and EMNG's and see ya in half a year!

Yeah I got lucky during a fent wd attempt about day 3 or 4 I was about to checkout of life(never would i. I’m too big of a pussy to ever do it but I say it to get my point across or maybe scare 1 person who reads this) or get high. I was so sick, stuck in a room at my parents house and they had no idea wtf I’m going through they just thought i slept a lot and was on my phone cuz I am just a crazy tard when I’m in withdrawls, I just let my head wonder off sometimes it’s just the anxiety that needs to chill to be able to get through being sick, I went on a mission to check my old script bag I had when I took care of my dad for 2 months when he had a 5way bypass and needed time to get better. Anyways, I also had norcos that he was prescribed and I was hoping maybe I forgot one, even tho I was 100% sure I didn’t I just said

Fuck it I’ll look, I found a few gabapent and took them, so 3 300 mg and I also found like almost 60 pregabas and looked them up and some doc said they are the Budweiser of opioids which I was like yeah ok, I took 400mg 50mg pills cuz I always think shit during wd doesn’t work and those fuckin things were great. It’s hard to not take them when you are not feeling wothdrawls. I sadly went out tho and broke the 4 day clean to get some blues to mix and party once more cuz I felt like I had the magic cure of wd, I ended up taking a few more days of ill start tomo syndrome but I tried to quit and used them, my tolerance went up crazy fast from just taking 800mg  within 3days, the 2nd day I was still feeling them from the night before and I didn’t even go or need to get blues that 2nd day the high to got from them helped me sleep for a few days, I also wanted to try to withdrawal and take the pregaba with enough sleep so I didn’t feel like a fucked up idk how to explain it but it was stilll hard to get off the fent but using those pregaba which I thought was better than gabapentin idk why why but the pregaba seemed to get me high faster than gaba and also slower tolerance build up, gaba took forever to hit and feel like your doin better than it also sucked even when I took an insanely amount during peak wd like day 3-4-5 one of those days i think it was day 3 cuz the craving to go get somthing to feel bbter was up there so I took 3000mg of gaba and it just was okay, wasn’t trying to get High off it cuz I knew I was too sick I just wanted to B able To sit

Still and my anxiety to think of addict ways to get money and stuff would stfu for awhile lol

If ghostfreak says tolerance goes down in a couple of days, I believe him!  While I have never taken these things daily, I suspect the tolerance portion is a lot like THC. It goes away with just a few days of abstinence.

Why thank you! Haha. Extended breaks are good but sometimes after a few days I just need *something* to take the edge off. Even smaller amounts (600-900mg) makes me a bit wobbly but anxiety is totally gone which is amazing. 


Maybe I should do a longer post about Pregabalin and its uses and effects?

Anything you type is of value GF.  You certainly know pregabalin.  And it shows occasional use keeps the effects fresh.  Although my high end with this stuff is 300 mgs. And I end up taking gabapentin over the pregabalin I have.  But hey if it keeps tolerance low I am all for it.  I use to take gabapentin like twice a week a few years ago.  Now more like twice a month.  I think gabapentinoids can be very useful substances.  On occasion I treat them like any other special drug.

And I end up taking gabapentin over the pregabalin I have.  But hey if it keeps tolerance low I am all for it.  I use to take gabapentin like twice a week a few years ago.  Now more like twice a month.  I think gabapentinoids can be very useful substances.  On occasion I treat them like any other special drug.

Certainly if one keeps chasing that "high"... tolerance builds fast with this substance.

I also find 600-900 with 2-3 days apart still gives me that magic (heavy eyes, head, and rushes down the legs and arms). Also mad social skills.

I’ve learned a lot the past year about my own use. Anything from 900 to 1500mg can produce the same effects and for the same amount of time. I think I wasted a lot by going over into the 2000mg amount.

I take a gram at a time; give so many darn away it sucks. My mom is badly addicted to these - IDK what too do


And NEVER take these if you have epilepsy unless you have plenty of strong anticonvulsant.  We are talking lorazepam or clonazepam

Well I only take doses that large a couple of times a month, usually starting at a gram and slowly taking another half gram or more (total 1.5-2 grams at MOST) and, with my usual clonazepam and opioid, it feels fuckin' fantastic; sometimes even in opioid wd it, with benzodiazepines of the potent type and (for me personally) the nitro subtype, almost completely eliminates opioid wd, though again, despite being called an anticonvulsant,  pregabalin and its analogoues and brothers and sisters are only effective at treating partial seizures,  that is, myoclonic seizures,  as opposed to full blown Tonic-Clonic


Even then it is a secondary treatment,  as in, taken with another anticonvulsant 


Another warning ![⚠️](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/26a0.png),  Keppra (leviteracitam) actually causes and/or increases anxiety, yet Depakote is actually synergistically relaxing, though Keppra is effective for grand mal (tonic clonic according to the latest DSM) amd petit Mal (Myoclonic)


Aside from those couple of times a month, I take 200-300mg, for secondary analgesic effects and because of the nice synergy with my primary RX meds (of which Pregabalin is one)


Although the next day after a binge take half a gram or at least a few hundred mgs to avoid a crash


BTW, anyone else heard about ketamine nasal spray? One of the enantiomers...

Start with half a gram, wait 40 minutes,  then go up every half hour or so by 100-200mg till you get to where you want to be; this is advice for LYRICA (Pregabalin) regular, not CR


Have actually taken both generic and Brand name, because an addicted relative also gets them and Medicaid makes you get name brand (in GA, it also makes you get Brand Name Suboxone strips; it will not pay for generic strips or tablets


It does (or did) pay for the buccal one, Bunavail,  I think


For gabapentin, it is more complex and, there is a reason gabapentin is not a federal controllled substance (only a few ridiculous states) while Lyrica is a CV RX only at the federal level.


Start with 800mg-1.2mg, depending on dosage strength ![💪](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f4aa.png) (there are 100.g, 300mg, 400mg, all capsules, and the "Arnold's " (sic) 600mg, tablets only


After initial dose, wait 30-40minutes, amd redose, several hundred milligrams 


Keep on until you feel better, though do not expect Lyrica results,  amd for some people it takes massive amounts mixed with DOC to get any significant response. On the other hand, everyone I have ever known f'ing loves Pregabalin/Lyrica 


If mixing with hard drugs cut dosage in half for either, OR for Lyrica go much slower until you know how your body responds  - YOU can always take more, never (almost) less


Hope that helps 


We should be going dark soon, hope you are well, Captains Heroin, Chris and all the fallen soldiers who selflessly helped so may people so much. God bless you all


Peace,  hoping to enjoy some Pregabalin myself in the next 24 hours amd make headway on my FFV ultra LLG run ![😎](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f60e.png)

Great info, thank you.


When you talk about this dosage protocol for pregabalin and gabapentin are you talking about them separately or combining?

Hi, nice advice from Lorne, just want to add, i have years of experience with pregabalin and doing wonders for my stimulant addiction and general wellbeing, currently im taking it around 3 or 4 times per week, if i feel "good", or "normal", i just try to skip´that day dose so i can keep my tolerance lower (incredible how pregabalin creates tolerance fast, and how it gone fast too).


In any case, i should wait aprox. 90 min. to feel the first effect of my dose, and i preffer to take it all at once (after know my optimal dose, and the minium possible at the same time, right now, 450mg., then 150 mg more when they kick, some times, not always), and if i have food in my stomach it will take 2 hours or more to feel the first mood lifting and anxiolytic effects, so, be aware of that, becouse all people i know start to feel any effect in the 90 or 120 mins after ingestion, dont redose before 120 min. if you dont know exactly how your body react to the drug.


Hope you can find what you are searching in pregabalin, cheers ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Separately, though the same would apply to combining except you must take no more than a gram (or 1.2 grams tops) every 30-40 minutes with gabapentin due to LAT issues causing BA% to drop with high doses taken all at once; this dies nit matter with lyrica/pregabalin,  except the more you take, the longer it takes to reach peak plasma levels, though this does not effect AUC 

(Example 100mg Tmax 50 minutes, 1 gram Tmax 3-4 hours)


Also with regards to gabapentin, both fatty meals and high protein meals have been demonstrated to significantly up the BA%, something to think about

In that regard it was almost worse than having sex on MXE. I mean it's kind of cool being able to go for 20-30 minutes but at a certain point you just want to finish.

Haven't had it for ages but yesterday I'd taken small doses through the day and it really helped with anxiety etc. Late at night I popped one and forgot what a potent and weird drug this is. I was walking like drunk by the time I was going to sleep. Felt good, creative, euphoric and stimulated but also drowsy. Such a strange drug.


Took 600mg tonight, wild ride. Was listening to some music I've been working on with the visualiser (on iTunes). Fucking trippy as well - all the music sounded good including stuff I was listening to on YouTube. Weird ass drug man. 


Also I found it to be highly effective for opiate WD/s.

I wanted to give some cautionary advice to anyone thinking of taking pregabalin recreationally. I hadn’t really messed with this substance before and you can buy it over the counter in Mexico, so I thought “why not?” I feel like I made a terrible mistake. The first day I took 600mg, followed by another 150mg when I was feeling the effects. What resulted was a very strange, almost opiate like psychedelic high that lasted several hours. What’s so bad about that? Aside from a strange feeling in my body, and some headaches/heart palpitations, it was enjoyable. I decided to repeat the experience the next day. So I did the same thing and dosed 600mg with 150mg shortly afterwards. I was then stupid enough to do it a third day in a row, this time being brash and taking 900mg. It was a different brand and I didn’t feel it as much. The day afterwards, in the afternoon, holy shit did I start feeling a comedown. Pregabalin also has anti anxiety effects and the rebound anxiety was something else. This was accompanied with a nasty feeling in my head, like I could literally feel the drug leaving my brain. I would forget things easily and over the next few days rebound anxiety and depression became worse. It is now Friday, five days since I ended the three day binge and I still don’t feel right. 


I realize I was stupid for doing such high doses three days in a row, but the comedown still seemed especially intense. I have had an easier time recovering from binging on opiates. So please be careful if you intend to use this substance recreationally.

I truly believed this was going to involve a seizure at some point and was gonna say "yeah me too kind of, except it was a mix of its little bro gabapentin along with caffeine" and I'm happy it didn't actually end that way. But five days after your binge and you still feel messed up (especially THAT messed up) makes me think you might actually be going through withdrawal. Surprised it could happen after just three days.


FYI on that third day of use though, I can't speak for whether that brand would work well for you or not, but pregabalin and gabapentin tend to be useless or at least very near to it after the second day of recreational use. It's a tolerance thing.

Is there any method to potentiate pregabalin? Any supplements or how to consume it? 

I have been using pregabalin recreational since 2010, have been dependent from it severeal times and thats why that substance is very familiar to me. But, even i don't take pregabalin very often these days, maybe once a month I have kinda permatolerance to it. I def can feel good with 300mg but to get desired effects I need to take 750 to 1050mg total in 6 to 8 hour span, i know it is pretty big dosage, not fatal though. If i take Gabapentin, i need to take 3200mg in 10 hour span.. . And here where I live, pregabalin is expensive. 

So, do you guys know how to make it feel stronger with smaller dosage?

There isn't a way to directly potentiate pregabalin.


I mean you could combine it with phenibut, gabapentin or even benzos, but this wont result in the potentiation of pregabalin. Instead you'll just experience additional effects from the combo.


I once had a 900 mg per day pregabalin prescription (3 of the 300mg capsules). There was no good reason for me to take it, i just sort of convinced my psychiatrist it was a good idea. The effect of the pregabalin was very unique; I would take the 900mg all at once in the late afternoon (around 5pm) And it would produce this weird sedated mania, with some empathenogenic qualities. It had an unusual nihilistic headspace where nothing mattered And that was okay because nothing mattered. It killed any ambition i had in life due to this existential mindset. Once i finally quit pregabalin, along with some other psychiatric medications I had no business taking (like huge doses of pregabalin and the antidepressant mirtazapine), i felt suddenly awakened and had urge to do something with my life. Not long after I applied to graduate school and was accepted, thereby moving forward with my life.


While phenibut and gabapentin have ambition killing effects, they do not produce a headspace like pregabalin, which is almost psychedelic like at high doses. And I have never felt much of a high at all from phenibut or gabapentin, although both can produce a similar mania, and phenibut has some music enhacing effects. But pregabalin was very different, producing both a high and unique mindset.

Xanax doesn't have a super long half life, but still that's a lot to take and it may have built up in your system more than normal and be there for a minute. I would probably wait at least 12-18 hours after you last dosed Xanax before taking any more sedatives.

Thanks for the help, to be safe ill tough put the leg pain until my shift starts tomorrow then ill use the pregabalin. I think i have a fast metabolism atleast for benzodiazepines, xanax for me starts working in less than 30 minutes, sometimes much quicker if i chew them, but the myorelaxation only lasts a couple hours, so i redose often. Your right for sure, that the duration of action isnt as long as the halflife so it probably compounds on itself. 

I receny (10 days ago) blacked out hard on GHB because i forgot i took baclofen and robax hours prior (i take them almost daily for muscle pain, i work in labour and am not as strong as i used to be)

Well unexpected things just happend, i slipped into psychosis again and injected narcan because i beleived a street chick sold me laced drugs, despite having no opioid like effects whatsoever i was terrified about (not dying) but how hospitilization would further alienate me and id lose my job (i was psychotic the day of this manic mishap because of bath salts and self destructive sort of muscle memory) i took one quarter xanax and dustings of a 75mg lyrica intravenou 5 times at most 3 atleast and it was stupidly just shots of dissolved tablet filtered with cotton and now i have what i can only describe as chronological dyslexia, i can not put together a timeline of what events happened in the order they happend regarding the last 4 days, i also had the worst panick attack of my life and was calling hotlines for 6 hours to ground myself from a full psychotic crack up. 

It took 8 hours of staring out blinds and calling hotlines before i could man up and find my abilify, was this because of my spontaneus benzo and lyrica abuse, or did the un needed narcan trigger my psychosis

Jeez. You gotta put the needle down, at the very least. Being safe and sanitary is the last thing you're thinking of when you're twacked out on bath salts. I've definitely been down that road, but it doesn't end anywhere good. Get back on your abilify and get some rest, eat some food, drink some water. 


For right now, don't worry about everything you did. That will come back in time. Just keep yourself safe and rest, that's what you need right now. If you can try and recollect exactly what it is you took, that would be a start.

That is a really hard cycle to get out of. I've definitely experienced powerful delusions first hand, and there are few things as painful as struggling to distinguish what is real or not. Try something, anything that can just ground your senses. Something to take up your attention. A movie is the first thing that comes to mind, but it can be a game, anything like that, that will will take up your focus a little bit. 


Do you have any stronger antipsychotics? Seroquel, something like that? There is no shame in going to the ER if you have to.

New users should start slow. First time I took Lyrica (100mg) I was in a state of panic for hours. Clonzepam didn't even help. 

Most don't have that reaction but be careful because it does effect some people like it did me

Im still having psychotic symptoms after a single dose of 150mg lyrica and in a delusional haze beleived a fellow street walker dosed me with pcp and fentanyl and robbed me because he thought i was an undercover (this almost certaintly did have some grounds in reality as im missing some clothes, and my debit card and cant remember 12 hours after i asked the dude if i could bum a cig.

But thinking i was fent poisoned i injected narcan 3 times and ever since ive been experiencing the overwhelming and vivid feeling that everyone can read my thoughts by making eye contact, and they know im a junky and want to hurt me. I can tell myself its all in my head and take my abilify and seroquel but the fear is real fear despite its artificial birth into my nervous system. I see people who love me and thier eyes strike fear into me i cannot ignore. Is it because of taking narcan with no opioid use for the prior 4 months?

How long ya been up? I don't believe it's the Lyrica at play here (could be wrong) but what else do you currently have in your system ATM?

Get plenty of fluids (optimally clean water), focus on breathing and try to stay calm. 

If shit ain't right call 911 or the equivalent to where you may be located.

Keep updating please. 

Thanks and best wishes,

This is concerning to me.

Can you see a doctor, therapist or if you are open to it maybe a rehab stint?

I just dont wanna see a "bad" outcome. Seems you're red lining already. No judgement just trying to keep the motor running....

Give it a break...? Get some food and nap in as soon as you can. Stay hydrated, yeah?

Peace

Me too.


Bluecollar, the goal is to feel centered, clear, healthy and aware in order to be the captain of your own ship.  Feel better, and when you make sense of your life come and clue me in.  There really is no glaring sense.  All you have to do is be present.  The biggest gift to all.  Come back in the next days and make us feel better after you feel better.

You have to take regular t breaks on gabapentinoids. Even 3 days since u last dosed can do the trick if your not hammering stupid amounts

Yeah pregabalin makes me feel manic too, extremely energetic and somehow sedated at the same time. And very horny.

Closed eye visuals are pretty intense with large dosages, especially in dark.

And I sleep like a baby afterwards.

I don't like benzos with pregabalin, i used to take speed with it, got extremely speedy, super horny and restless at the same time.. ![😂](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f602.png)

I only wish to make pregabalin more potent, i have noticed it works little bit faster and harder when taken to empty stomach at morning and a lots of water with it and eating 2 hours after consuming it. 

Little bit of alcohol potentiates it too (maybe 2 to 4 beers/cider/Vodka shots) but it can make you feel nauseous and tired if you drink too much.

Well, pregabalin is pretty interesting because if you take with a depressant it increases it's depressant effect, but if you take with a stimulant it increases its stimulant effect as well.

I have noticed that too! It boosts almost every other drug, but it's hard to boost it with something. Only taking more pregabalin I guess.

I see closed eye visuals a lot, flashing colors, geometric and caleidoscopic shapes, strings, it's very unique and havent seen them on any other substances.

Interesting thing to note, a lower dose of Pregabalin gave me the same effects as 900mg. This was 2 days after although a dose of like 1800mg gives me the same effects as 900mg so I don’t know what to think about this - probably won’t be as long lasting but we’ll see.

Lyrica (Pregabalin) is a very effective anxiolytic medication 


Pregabalin 150mg capsules - 450mg is the recommended maximum daily dose I believe 


It is essential in my beloved Brompton Cocktail 


Methadone 100-125mg

Ritalin (Methylphenidate) 50-70mg IR

Valium (Diazepam) 20-30mg

Xanax (Alprazolam) 1mg

Lyrica (Pregabalin) 300-450mg

Ethanol (Gin) 2.oz X 4-6 drinks over 4h or so 


For serious chronic pain...fully tolerant to this Cocktail 10+ years....it's a blessing 


My beloved hybrid Brompton Cocktail / oral Speedball lol

there is this constant cycle of dopamine rebound and meth and aripiprazole like hitting gas and brakes at the same I knew someone who was frustrated why speed is bad by ignoring the fact that he takes two antipsychs daily 


as for pregabalin if you have it from that ghb pain in the ass short duration it will give you some sleep and relief as baclofen, but get 


some sleep and eat something just like you said man up 


if IT didnt came for couple days it police or any fear there won't be just relax and rest collect your self till you have train of thoughts or 

just write here do'nt take anything maybe eat, water, sleep....you know


take comfort in fact that I myself was ghb dependant and gbl like 2yrs 10 yrs ago give or take as know on pregabalin prescribed with Concerta and functioning 

!


Some days I take more and the demons come but some meditation breathing and TV or writing brush that off

Been experimenting lately to see if a lower dose will give the same results as a higher one. Been consistently taking 900mg but have lowered it to 600mg. Due for a refill this coming week so will continue on and see if it helps.

Hi, i have experienced the same, or something similar.


After rest just one day, 450mg would give me the same effect of 750mg, but thats the roof for me, any more and i will fall asleep randomly when they kick, even with 450mg i would fall asleep at my work randomly (i have my own business and sometimes take a beer, then have someone with me hours later worried becouse i was sleeping without response to anything, but breathing and live.


Im methamphetamine addict like from 10 years ago and at least 5 without a single day pause i guess thats very relevant, but even with a nice sleep last night, i have taken 450mg in the night confident that i will not fall asleep cuz im smoking meth and working at the night, and most times they knock me out at least few hours, specially in the night, so i cant take so much even with tolerance and i would really like to have good efects of it with tolerance. Thanks god i have that "limit", or i will be much more addicted to lyrica for sure.

Hey, new here, so I hope Im doing everything right. I got a couple of questions:


1) Is there a ceiling for when taking more doesnt really change the "high"?

Like, is it a waste to take more than [...] mgs?


2) Does anyone else have the strong urge to redose and redose and redose? Does this just extend the high? It doesnt make the high any stronger, in my opinion.


3) Ive been taking 2400mgs at once, always with 2-3 day breaks inbetween (or else it doesnt get me high anymore). Ive been doing this for 2 years now. How long do I need to stop to get high with fewer mgs? Maybe 1800mgs would get me high now, I havent tried, thats why I asked question 1)


4) Will I ever feel the therapeutic effects (been taking it for GAD, when I first got it) again, or am I shit out of luck because Ive been abusing it for years?


Thanks a lot!

1. I don’t find any change from taking 900 and upwards tbh. Took double and the feelings were relatively unchanged. 


2. Yeah redosing doesn’t seem to work (at least for me anyway). I can take 600mg at 1pm and then take another 600mg 3 hours later and feel nothing. 


3. I usually take 600-900mg with 2-3 days off and can easily feel good again from 450-600mg. You’ll probably need at least a week or maybe two to fully feel your tolerance drop a bit. 


4. You could try a month off to feel any real benefit from therapeutic doses.

I've been using 1500mg sometimes for tramadol withdrawal... now I'm scared I'm from Argentina. It's really hard. The box of pregabalin I need costs me 15 dollars, and it's very difficult for me to get that money now. I'm really scared.

Youre overdoing it. Clonazepam, Diazepam, Tramadol, at the same time, at those doses?


Listen, Pregabalin withdrawal can be bad, but its not deadly. Youll get through this. Dont waste all these drugs to not feel the withdrawal. Its pointless and a waste of money.


The only drugs that could kill you when you go cold turkey, are benzos, alcohol and barbiturates. Dont throw in more benzos, for the love of god.

Exaggerating?? This is hell. And yes, I am taking those doses, and yes, I know it's a waste of money and all that shit. I've been taking benzos and opioids for years, don't tell me I'm exaggerating.

I have to deal with opioid withdrawal tomorrow, along with pregabalin withdrawal. Don't tell me I'm exaggerating.

Wasting more drugs on it, while you dont have money to stock up on Lyrica, is a mistake though.


Youll go through it either way. Youve taken two benzos and Tramadol, which is like the shittiest opiate you can take, and yet youre stsill suffering.


Dont throw more drugs into your system. Suffer these couple of days, drink a lot of water, eat, if you can. Youll be alright.


I know it sounds harsh, but youll get through this.

I for one feel your pain bro (Imma ramble for a bit but I will give u some recommendations further down as well). 


I am also horribly addicted mainly to opiates and pregabalin. I am talking over a decade long addiction and I honestly find people that underestimate the withdrawal from pregabalin offensive and even dangerous. I have experienced withdrawal from a long pregabalin-only addiction before, I have experienced withdrawal from a long heroin, fentanyl, -name the opiate- addiction before. I have experienced withdrawal from a long alprazolam and diazepam addiction before as well and; 

the pregabalin withdrawal is fuckin WAY worse than anything else I have experienced. And I ran out of new drugs to try a long time ago.. Opiate withdrawals are very bad. mentally as well but the main hell is the physical part. If you are withdrawing from a serious, several gram a day pregabalin habit, There is basically a CONSTANT panic + anxiety attack type feeling going on in your head and chest. I could NEVER imagine going through full pregabalin cold turkey withdrawal. When I tried, I was in the constant panic attack I mentioned (I know what a real one feels like) and my body was jolting randomly like I was being electrocuted. I could not move because every fucking nerve in my body was hurting. Not in the way opiate wd hurts, not less just very very different. I felt like I was going into psychosis because of the TOTAL inability to sleep and the constant SEVERE anxiety. My friend told me that the jolting was exactly what he was experiencing right before he suffered EP from lyrica wd so I could easily have gone into EP, choke and died. don't tell people to cold turkey.. ffs. 


I have managed to get through opiate wd with very little "help". Its bad, "but it is possible", like someone said about the lyrica. I could NEVER and would never quit lyrica cold turkey. Its a totally different.. astronomically different animal. If I ever ran out and the shitty "doctors" in my country refused to help me I would 100% find the nearest fucking train track and wait for the express..". "lucky" for me I am able to buy several Hg's at once of pregabalin powder/crystals MUCH cheaper than the finished, expensive as fuck pharma product is sold for "on the streets" because I could never afford my addiction that way.


So, why I say it's dangerous to suggest anyone to quit pregabalin cold turkey is; because IT CAN be fuckin dangerous. Pregabalin differs VERY little from "benzos, alcohol and barbiturates" that certainly are not the only drugs that are dangerous to cold turkey on. A serious GHB withdrawal can also kill you, for example. The pregabalin high is actually very similar to GHB in higher dosages.

benzos, alcohol and barbiturates.. AND Pregabalin, GHB, gabapentin are all drugs that in some way or another have something to do with the GABA system. and they are all dangerous and they are all a real fucking bitch to wd from. Benzos are no different but pregabalin wd is basically like benzo wd on steroids with a side of heroin wd.


I have no personal evidence of pregabalin withdrawal actually killing anyone I know, personally (like I have with GHB) but my friend suffered his EP seizure while at the hospital where they were refusing to give him any treatment despite him begging for his life, telling them that he was dying. And as mentioned I have also been on the brink of possible death from this.


SO.

My friend. Not only is it not a "waste" to take benzos during your wd. you SHOULD use benzos during your wd. Diazepam and Clonazepam especially, because those two are frquently prescribed as "antiepileptics" (or whatever the fuck) and will help to keep you from suffering EP and possibly choke to death on your tongue. They obviously also help prevent the severe anxiety from turning into a full on panic attack. The hard part is not overdoing the benzos. You are detoxing after all, you will and u should feel like shit. only use the benzos when it gets really bad.. which will be, all the time honestly for a good little while. This is also a part that is different from heroin. The wd is much longer as well. with heroin I always feel like the main struggle is over after like 2 weeks. Its not over then but its generally down hill after two weeks, in a good way. When I was wd'ng from lyrica two weeks was just the beginning with no end in sight. I just could not do it. Like I said, i feel you and I am sorry you are going through this. There 100% is no other way to do it then tapering of SLOWLY. I dont remember exactly how my friend did it but it was something like lowering your current dosage by 10% every 3 weeks. or even longer, you will know if you lower it to much to soon because that panic attack knocks on your door as soon as you dont have enough pregabalin or benzos in your system. Like this; If u dont feel like shit you are taking to much. If you feel like you are about to die and your body jolts randomly, you are in the danger zone. Tramadol on the other hand is a very big no no because it LOWERS your threshold to EP. I am saying tramadol can kill you while in serious pregabalin wd. Sell your tramadol and buy benzos and or gabapentin. those two are your friends in this situation. I am not sure actually if gabapentin lowers or raises the ep threshold but I am thinking that it at the very least does not effect it at all. what I do know is Gabapentin and pregabalin are very similar drugs. Gabapentin is basically Lyricas weaker twin and works like a perfect substitute to pregabalin so you should be good. pregabalin has been confirmed to be 6x stronger than gabapentin so, dose accordingly (6:1).


As we are in the same boat basically, feel free to reach out. Ive been through this more than once. 

I am currently trying to taper down my pregabalin and opiate usage. I was on mainly heroin/bupe and pregabalin along with every type of downer you can think of. I still am, minus the heroin which I managed to quit completely a while back by tapering my dosage and eventually replacing it with kratom. I buy a gram of heroin here and there very sporadically but I feel like I have that beast under control. My personal goal is not to quit doing drugs. My goal is, being able to live life without HAVING to do drugs all day every day. I want drugs to be enhancers of my life on occasion, not a requirement in order to get out of bed. I know this does might not be a popular opinion but I belive I can live life like that. I think the idea of "always in recovery" is a bad mindset to have. And sure, some people just naturally lack self control and for real cant smoke a joint or have a beer without spiraling into disaster in less than 24h. even after 20 years of sobriety. I am not looking down on those people but that is a type of personality that simply should not do drugs and never should have tried drugs. 


I digress;

am currently working on tapering down the pregabalin and eventually the kratom. I am not in a hurry tho, taking my time because I have the privilege of not being drug tested at work and having a steady access to the drugs i need. Im not some drug kingpin, far from it. haven't sold a drug in my life, honestly.. its 2024, drugs are everywhere if you know where to look. and if someone has survived as long me doing this, one has not have to look far. It's a bless and a curse. I would have 100%  commited suduko decades ago if it werent for illiegal drug use and that is just a fact. I owe my life to drugs and that is, just what it is. Anyway.


every time my tapering goes to shit is when I go to low to soon. my lyrica dosage at its highest was up to 5 grams, often more than 2-3 times a day. Right now, some days I feel fine with 300mg every 12h. some days are harder and I have to take more. I am kind of stuck at 300mg though I have tried taking 200mg and some days even 150mg but I can never stay there. Eventually (when the surplus pregabalin in my body wears of or something) that panicy feeling slowly creeps up and I have to go back to 300mg or add a bens/gabapentin. but I will not lie it has been a long road leading to where I am at right now. I assume your situation is not as bad when it comes to the amount and time youve been on your particular constellation of substances. 


Regardless,    

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions. I am a certified expert in feeling like shit due to detox or lack of drugs. And I am not "one of those people", who are into the whole 12 steps, AA, come to jesus .. stuff. not knocking on people who are, or if you are. But what I am saying is if you feel a need to talk or have questions I will try to help you, not try to recruit you or brainwash you. Im not saying everyone in AA does this but a good amount does. some people are damn near predatory on here I have noticed. Being in AA is an addiction/cope mechanism in itself and one should also regulate that usage. In my opinion.


Anyway, unlike some people I DO know what it feels like and you CAN get through it. It just takes some planning and a lot of determination.. and strong self control in order to not just become super addicted to the "helpers" instead. or even worse ADD more stuff to your addiction. 


And my man (I assume you are a man), if you are not able to get a hold of the "helpers" or can't afford them, and your usage has been anywhere close to mine I order you to seek medical help. Because, again; it can definitely be dangerous, even if you are not at the point where it is dangerous physically. The evil fckin thoughts that can pop up when it is at its worst, are obviously dangerous. just as life threatening.


I am not trying to scare you or be dramatic. I just have first hand, second hand, fuckin ten hand worth of experience in precisely the situation you are in. One does not simply cold turkey from pregabalin. And one does certainly not simply cold turkey from pregabalin AND opiates at the same time![:facepalm:](https://www.bluelight.org/community/data/assets/smilies/C823789D-FB54-4A70-9808-5E6478A9926D.gif).


Oh and by the way. I am mad depressed along with a general anxiety disorder even when I am not tapering down. Sooo yeah, I told you to reach out if u want but I can't guarantee I will be logged in here when you do. Sometimes I am here everyday, sometimes I don't log in for months at a time.  Make sure you have someone to call when shit gets bad, call the hospital if you have to. 


and yeah, good luck man. I will end with this in case you are in a similar life situation as me as well:

TRUST me i know what it's like to not have a single milligram of need to live and it might seem like there is no way out of the tunnel. I honestly still feel like that sometimes but I realized I have people that depend on me. shit, at least A person would be devastated and all alone if checked out from this life and I could never leave them alone here with all the shit.. all the shit people and just all the overall..shit. This fact keeps me alive and i promise that there is something, probably many things that are similar in your case. It does not even have to people; if u dont have any in your life. when you are done with the worst part of the wd things will start to brighten up if only just a tiny bit, and you will thank yourself for not ending it. Life has a habit of putting its boot on the neck of people that are not happy to begin with. Dont give that motherfucker the pleasure of defeating you. Fuck that motherfucker, get through the wd and THEN begin your plan of attack on life. Addicts are more often than not talented, special people that simply are not allowed to spread their wings in todays society. thats why it keeps the boot on your neck. You full potential is scary to todays society. Recover and give them hell, or it. whatever. I believe in you ![:p](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)![:peperave:](https://www.bluelight.org/community/data/assets/smilies/F4E761B5-82C6-4705-9326-CE2213B89C26.gif)

So I did a redoing test yesterday. 


900mg at 10am


600mg at 2.30pm


300mg at 5pm


Was nice and relaxed in the morning, this is my usual dose anyway so was feeling warm and comfortable. 


Second dose didn’t produce much feelings and didn’t extend the morning high. 


Third one was probably a waste and did absolutely nothing. 


This is just me and might be different for someone else but redosing was pretty poor effects wise. On a good note my anxiety was squashed but did feel a bit empty in a way.

> I once had a 900 mg per day pregabalin prescription (3 of the 300mg capsules). There was no good reason for me to take it, i just sort of convinced my psychiatrist it was a good idea. The effect of the pregabalin was very unique; I would take the 900mg all at once in the late afternoon (around 5pm) And it would produce this weird sedated mania, with some empathenogenic qualities. It had an unusual nihilistic headspace where nothing mattered And that was okay because nothing mattered. It killed any ambition i had in life due to this existential mindset. Once i finally quit pregabalin, along with some other psychiatric medications I had no business taking (like huge doses of pregabalin and the antidepressant mirtazapine), i felt suddenly awakened and had urge to do something with my life. Not long after I applied to graduate school and was accepted, thereby moving forward with my life.

And I have never felt much of a high at all from phenibut or gabapentin, although both can produce a similar mania, and phenibut has some music enhacing effects. But pregabalin was very different, producing both a high and unique mindset.

There definitely is a way. 

I never really feel the anxiolytic effects anymore but I use pregabalin to potentiate, literally any other drug / medication. 

But I am 100% positive that omeprazole, 20-60mg 30-60 minutes before taking the pregabalin potentiates significantly. For me at least. omeprazole also potentiates most benzos in my cases. again, significantly. I discovered this a few years back when my tolerance got to that point when I did not get "high" from it anymore. But then one morning I took 40mg omeprazole with my lyrica and a relatively small dose at that ,in my case. I went about my summer day sippin on a monster energy drink and from nowhere I got.. very fucked up. It was like one of the very first times I got high on pregabalin again. So today when I take pregabalin only and looking to kill anxiety I usually take omeprazole before or even just both at once. omeprazole increases / decreases, inhibits, enhances.. It has something to do with one of those CYP enzymes and I find it to potentiate some benzos as well. I think it works better then WGPJ.

Not pregabalin but I superstitiously use apple cider vinegar to potentiate gabapentin.  To me pregabalin is plenty strong.  But I guess if a person is on it daily seems logical to find a way to make it stronger.


I am astounded at the short half lives of pregabalin and gabapentin.  It seems even 24 hours later can be 5 half lives, at least at moderate doses.  That always confused me as the duration of action seems longer than the half life.


There was a thread in N&P discussing duration of action verses half lives.  Been looking for it.

But pregabalin is not subject to hepatic metabolism, the induction or inhibition of the P450 system (CYPs) should leave it unchanged? The bioavailability of pregabalin is also what? 98%? So it can’t be that it increases bioavailability? 

I wonder what the reason for potentiation could be.

I have tried pregabalin in a few ways but so far I’m happy with 600mg once of dose and it feels so good and last a long time. 


Think I will be using it more when I feel like relapsing so to speak

Hey guys, new to this thread but I’ve read a decent bit of it and there’s some useful stuff in here.


I’ve been doing pregabs/lyrica a couple of times a week, last week three days, and it’s probably getting out of control. I’m not using every day and don’t think I will but I use a lot when I do use — over a gram in redosing, I just find it so moreish, and I’ve gained confidence doing what I’ve been doing that I can handle a high dose.  Most I’ve done is 2.1g on the second time I did two days in a row since there seems to be some kind of extreme short term tolerance if I do two days in a row.  Anyway will be going to a friends and taking a week off everything but had a couple of questions.  


I tried plugging it cause why not, I’d just eaten and didn’t want to wait — 900mg done in 300 mg doses over two hours. Three hours after last dose i still had nothing. Psychonaut claims great availability and peak faster, I felt like I got a slight something right away and then that faded to pretty much nothing.


Ended up doing 1350mg in three doses orally and felt great. The first 600mg blew the maybe something from plugging out of the water. I’ve searched and seen a couple people talking about plugging it but has anyone here actually done it, was it as underwhelming as I found it?


My other question is next day after large doses, do you guys still feel affected by it? It’s almost the afternoon here and my hands are still slightly jerky, head full of cotton wool a bit tho in an enjoyable way. When I got up at 7 and went to the toilet I was bouncing off the walls. Passed out cause I hadn’t turned off tv or anything, I find pregabs + getting actually tired leads to me just passing out, even tho I don’t find them sedating really. 


Sorry to post a whole wall of text but you guys seems really experienced, I’m new to gabapentinoids.

I’m not a 100% on this as I can’t back it up, can’t find the medical research thing. Anyhow 

What it said is that there is almost like a ceiling effect between 600-900mg once off dose. There after redoing doesn’t really add or help much. Think it said to wait 4-6 hrs before redosing. If I find the article I will post it.

So I tried the omeprazole before Pregabalin (out of curiosity really) and just felt the same. The dosage was 40mg Omep and 600mg Pregabalin.


Was gonna get the esomeprazole but they were dearer than the original but same effects anyway from when I took them for acid reflux years ago.

Hi folks, I have a lot of experience with gabapentin but I'm finding my way with pregabalin. Hias dosage I've taken is 200 mg. I'm aware of tolerance develops quickly and it absorbs better than gabapentin. What's a good dose to like catch a buzz off it? Should I try like 400 mg? I'm not looking to transcend if you know what I mean, just looking to catch a good buzz.  Thought I would post it here. I apologize in advance since I'm sure this information is easily found but I thought I would just ask in the thread instead of making a new post.

There are people more knowledgeable than me in this thread but I think the general recreational dose is 300-600mg. If you’re not tolerant I think 400 would have you feeling good. 400 shouldn’t have you wrecked if that’s what you mean by transcend but should feel nice.

What's your highest dose gabapentin you do or take? Like stagger up to? And what dise does gabapentin start hitting you. Easier to answer the pregabalin dose. As I know gabapentin as well very good and know what pregbalin does I need for said gabapentin dose

Gabs are hit or miss.  I tossed my original rx because I was convinced they did nothing of value.

Then my doc said try Lyrica.  Hits every day at 450 mg; taken at once or staggered.

Gabapentin was a nightmare compared to Lyrica poor replacement

I could take 10x (4500 mg) staggered and I swear it just gets me to baseline feels like;

[@drfuck](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/586029/) why not take a tolerance break? Or drop the dosages as low as possible and then take tolerance break.


Anyhow for me I had my normal 600mg dose and every time I get heavy munchies, any one else get that?

Nothing measures up to the munchies I get from pregabalin. I can eat a whole meal and still be hungry and if I do eat more it still tastes divine. 


Very different from benzo munchies where I feel like it’s mostly the disinhibition that promotes appetite. And weed just makes things taste a lil better. I don’t get an increase in cravings like with pregabalin. 

What’s your go-to munch? 


I read a study on it a couple of years back, I can’t attest to if it’s sound. It was something to do with dopamine inhibition in a specific part of the brain if I remember correctly. I’ll try to look for it.

i take 450 mg/day.  Ran out due to pain doc/primary care doc both calling in the rx for me but then it was at two pharmacies which is a no no.

so I ended up taking mega benzos thinking I was in benzo withdrawal with akastesia (like restless legs/ but you can not sit still or sleep so pacing and walking it is.  It is a movement disorder and my son who has seen me at my worst said straight up that pregabalin withdrawal looked 100 percent equivalent to benzo withdrawal which I have now because I have extra lyrica the cure is only temporary but its always something.  At least it didn't have the pain in the legs that methadone withdrawal causes.  

I have been to the ER a few times for the trifecta withdrawal; methadone lyrica clonazepam until they told me not to come any more.

Now my pain doc is retiring and the methadone clinic don't like the lyrica or clonazepam.

My primary will give me suboxone pregabalin benzo but I have to switch from years of methadone.  I am at 15mgs/day and hate withdrawal

Also pharms are going out of business/overwhelmed so try waiting in line for hours at rite aid and walgreens only to be told no at the counter with akathesia is almost impossible but its the pharmacy has the cure

My pain doc gave me gabapentin but I didn;t like it, would of killed for some last couple days!

But it was 2008 or so and Lyrica was magic my pain doc asked me have I heard of it.

Paid 300/month for it so many years when Pfizer had the patent for it

Anyhoo took too much pregabalin and not enough benzos lol

Careful mate, you’re most likely physically addicted so you’ll get withdrawal effects if and when you stop so be careful. Just incase you didn’t know pal ![👍🏻](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f44d-1f3fb.png)

You should be ok going from 15 mgs of methadone to suboxone that’s a low enough dose, I’m on 45mgs tapering down to 30 so I can get the new subutex arm IM injection it last like 4/5 weeks without any wd symptoms 

It’s amazing, im in uk, just wondering do they have the new injection in the US ?

some observation, I was 6 days withot pregabalin and I take it for like 5 years minimum and honestly i might even felt better, a bit edgy well I had time as editing some videos for photos, weddings and commercials, also i love to mix techno, well that is the thing now I almost cannot hear the music when I took 450mg I can hear it but probably when my noradrenaline stopped spiking being elevated for a day or two like sympathetic system was like a constant I barely had a quality sleep

but at the time like yesterday I mixed progressive house morphing into minimal techno style and without pregabalin I only had a bit stomach ache higher and I think I will probably stop with tapering, cause I was going in the city for the rx and driving in the morning crowd was I had some moments of agressive thoughts and i just connected phone and listen to music which is also felt better and different


Watched dune 3rd time both parts at the weekend without meds and I felt like I watch it the first time, so after I remembered Phenibut blissful feeling is better than any gabapentinoid as GHB is to short duration. benzos are always to boring so I take clonazepam if needed. now I try to imagine how great it would be that Phenibut is instead of pregabalin or baclofen even. All gabapentinoids are very hard to maintain dose so I think only when I took phenibut last time I made the best things, and I checked with other people as high sugestibility or dellusion of grandiose or ego to the roof is something noticeable.


so long term users as occasional and those that stopped, what are your opinions on pregabs and without pregabs?

Hi everyone! Sorry im not sure if this is the right tread to ask. Anyway my question is can you iv Lyrica? I got these 300mg caps i hve been popping them alongside with my methadone orally but takes long time to kick in this way and i wonder if it gives you a rush shooting them. Is there fillings in the capsule or is it straight pregabalin

the bioavailability is very close to being 100%, there is to much of it to think about it. it 's not like f.e. buprenorphine 2mg with filtering the most of the other like Alkaloid(company) its the smallest pill I saw of BUP, pregabs 450 or 900mg than repeating you would have pregabalin instead of blood in couple days. but here are people that did or do have experience with needle as I just do not on myself nor the other...frack I meant seeing other and reading here threads posts on various IV. I still do not reccomend.


just be grateful that you have it I never did understand that I cannot wait to kick in. dont wait.

Never actually heard of anyone IV’g Pregabalin. The bioavailability is too high orally to be taken any other way.

I been off this forum for ages and logged back in reading your post cuz I feel for you. I got brain cancer and seizures due to it and ended up with compartment syndrome in my arm after a seizure and had bad nerve pain for very long after. I am fortunate and my doc is very patient oriented but she suggested bupernorphine low dose for it cuz I couldn't tolerate the nerve pain meds (could barely stay conscious) but I've been on subs in past and did well with them. That Is an off label use but I feel it helped (not 100%)

I had extreme pregabalin withdrawal; I assumed it was benzos as I had been binging.  But since I was out of pregabs the benzos would give me an hour or two of relative relief; but running out of benzos.


However once I got pregabalin back after one week I had instant relief.


For me the unbearable part of benzo and pregabalin withdrawal is akathesia or pacing.

methadone is restless leg; but I have never had puking or shitting which I imagine would elevate its withdrawal potential if I dared go without

Potentially it causes cancer but it’s only been shown to cause cancer in mice. More studies are needed. 


“[Pregabalin](https://hpr-rps.hres.ca/reg-content/summary-basis-decision-detailOne.php?lang=en&linkID=SBD00089#:~:text=It%20should%20be%20noted%20that,is%20assumed%20to%20be%20epigenetic.) has no genotoxic activity, thus its mode of carcinogenic action is assumed to be epigenetic. In summary, because of the positive carcinogenic findings in mice, the carcinogenic potential of pregabalin for humans remains a matter of concern. However, since the carcinogenic activity of pregabalin has been demonstrated only in one species (mice) at relatively high systemic exposures (based on blood level comparison of pharmacokinetic parameters with those of humans) and not in a second species (rats), the potential carcinogenic risk of pregabalin exposure in humans is considered to be small”


[Pregabalin (study)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38026843/#:~:text=Pregabalin%20is%20a%20single%2Dspecies,mice%20via%20a%20nongenotoxic%20mechanism.) is a single-species carcinogen producing only one type of tumor, hemangiosarcomas in mice via a nongenotoxic mechanism.

Is it safe to IV lyrica? And if so what is a good starting dose?

Noo don't do that [@theothersideofthehorizon](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/589452/) , it has to pass some kind of metabolism in the stomach I think

Wish me luck tomorrow guys, I'm going to hopefully be able to aske my doc to be switched to pregabalin instead of gabapentin. Would be so awesome, lyrica will forever be my favourite substance. Missed it a tonne.

Is 600 mg Lyrica + 2 mg Ativan dangerous for first time recreational use? I just took it and I’m concerned that because I don’t have a tolerance to either drug that I should have started lower. Any thoughts?

Any thoughts from lyrica users? I just started taking this med yesterday (50mg) and while it worked wonders for my pain, I'm a student so cognition is kind of important :/

It absolutely causes cognitive impairment, its palpable, starts with forgetting words; ends with all you listed.

if not taken in large doses i personally did not notice any cognitive impairment as to lyrica...did not notice any significant pain releiving properties on it's own, got weak sedative properties,not great recreational value also....good for weaning opies and benzos...probably that's why it is schedule 5 in U.S......at lot of places is even otc.....it's good med imo untill it's not overused....relatively low toxicity-that's how i feel that stuff....know this stuff from ten years

PS.......not very wise to mix the stuff with other depressants or inject the stuff
