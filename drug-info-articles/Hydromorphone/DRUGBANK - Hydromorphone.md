# Hydromorphone
*Source: https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB00327*

## Overview

### Description

This compound belongs to the class of organic compounds known as morphinans. These are polycyclic compounds with a four-ring skeleton with three condensed six-member rings forming a partially hydrogenated phenanthrene moiety, one of which is aromatic while the two others are alicyclic.

### Background

Hydromorphone is a pure opioid,
1
a semi-synthetic hydrogenated ketone derivative of
morphine
that has been available clinically since 1920. Structurally, hydromorphone derived from
morphine
in the modification of the hydroxyl group in the carbon 6 to a carbonyl and the absence of a double bond between the carbon 7 and 8. Due to these modifications, it presents a very high potency and comparable side effect profile to the parent compound.
2
Even though hydromorphone does not present a 6-hydroxyl group, it is categorized under the family of phenanthrenes and it is considered a chemical under the schedule II (medical purposes with high addiction potential).
3
The first reported approved product containing hydromorphone in the form of hydromorphone hydrochloride was developed by Fresenius Kabi USA and FDA approved in 1984.

### Indication

Hydromorphone is indicated for the management of moderate to severe acute pain and severe chronic pain. Due to its addictive potential and overdose risk, hydromorphone is only prescribed when other first-line treatments have failed.
1
The WHO has proposed a three-step ladder for the management of pain in which it is suggested to start with a non-opioid medication followed by addition of weak opioids to the non-opioid treatment for moderate pain and finishing in the use of strong opioids such as hydromorphone along with the existing regimen for cases of severe pain.
2
Off-label, hydromorphone can be administered for the suppression of refractory cough.
1

### Pharmacodynamics

In clinical trials, hydromorphone has been shown to be suitable for pain relief in patients that do not tolerate the side effects of
morphine
or that suffer from renal failure or asthma. It has been shown to be 5-7 times more potent than morphine with a shorter duration of analgesia.
2
Some of the observed effects of the consumption of hydromorphone for acute pain are complete and longlasting pain relief when compared to other pain relief agents such as
meperidine
,
morphine
,
diamorphine
,
bupivacaine
,
indomethacin
, and
fentanyl
. On the same trials, hydromorphone was shown to produce respiratory depression, lower cognitive function, miosis, mydriasis, constipation, hypotension, and vertigo but to present a reduced incidence of pruritus (which indicates a lower release of histamine) and nausea.
7
The respiratory depression is known to be caused by the effect on the brain stem respiratory centers as well as to a reduction in the responsiveness of this brain stems to increase carbon dioxide tension.

### Absorption

The immediate release version of hydromorphone reaches its peak concentration after 30-60 minutes while the extended-release version reaches the peak concentration after 9 hours.
1
When administered orally, hydromorphone is absorbed mainly in the upper small intestine with a bioavailability of 60% due to intensive first-pass metabolism. In the controlled-release version of hydromorphone, the absorption follows a biphasic pharmacokinetic profile. However, even though there are clear distinctions in the absorption pathway of hydromorphone, the AUC of both versions is reported to be of 34 ng.h/ml which indicates an equivalence.
2
The parenteral administration of hydromorphone, which is the most common pathway, presents an almost immediate absorption as observed by the presence of peak plasma concentration almost immediately. This peak plasma concentration declines rapidly due to fast redistribution into liver, spleen, kidney and skeletal muscle. In the parenteral route, the pharmacokinetic profile is log-linear and dose-dependent and to present a higher bioavailability of 78%.
2
Other administration routes such as rectal, nasal, intraspinal and transdermal present lower bioavailability and changes in their pharmacokinetic profile.
2

### Metabolism

The metabolism of hydromorphone is mainly hepatic and it is represented by the generation of hydromorphone-3-glucuronide through glucuronidation reactions.
1
This primary metabolic pathway is done by the activity of the UDP-glucuronosyltransferase-2B7.
4
The first-pass hepatic metabolism is so large that it represents 62% of the initial administered dose.
3
On the other hand, hydromorphone is also characterized by the presence of minor metabolic pathways such as the CYP3A4- and CYP2C9-driven generation of norhydromorphone.

### Half-life

The half-life of hydromorphone immediate-release is of 2-3 hour while the extended release can range from 8-15 hours.
1

### Toxicity

The reported LD50 of hydromorphone in the mouse was of 104 mg/kg when given intravenously and 84 mg/kg when given orally.
12
The reports of overdose with hydromorphone are characterized by respiratory depression, somnolence, skeletal muscle flaccidity,  cold and clammy skin, constricted pupils, myosis, mydriasis, bradycardia, hypotension, apnea, circulatory collapse, cardiac arrest, and even death.
Label
The management of an overdose might require assisted ventilation, supportive measures, as well as cardiac massage and defibrillation. It can be recommended the use of
naloxone
solely in the cases of respiratory depression. The use of opioid antagonist should be restricted to patients that present respiratory depression as they can produce acute abstinence symptoms.
Label
Hydromorphone was not shown to be mutagenic nor clastogenic and long-term studies of carcinogenicity studies have not been performed. On the other hand, reduced implantation sites and viable fetuses were noted at a 2X normal concentration.

### Drug Interactions

This information should not be interpreted without the help of a healthcare provider. If you believe you are experiencing an interaction, contact a healthcare provider immediately. The absence of an interaction does not necessarily mean no interactions exist.

1,2-Benzodiazepine
The risk or severity of adverse effects can be increased when Hydromorphone is combined with 1,2-Benzodiazepine.
Abacavir
Hydromorphone may decrease the excretion rate of Abacavir which could result in a higher serum level.
Abatacept
The metabolism of Hydromorphone can be increased when combined with Abatacept.
Abrocitinib
The metabolism of Abrocitinib can be decreased when combined with Hydromorphone.
Aceclofenac
Aceclofenac may decrease the excretion rate of Hydromorphone which could result in a higher serum level.

### Food Interactions

Avoid alcohol.
Take with or without food. Food does not significantly affect absorption.

### Mechanism of action

Hydromorphone is an opioid agonist that can bind to different types of opioid receptors. Its analgesic effect is suggested to be related to the effect on the mu-opioid receptors. It has been reported to also have a minor affinity for the delta and kappa receptor.
3
,
6
On the other hand, it is known to act at the level of the medulla which allows it to depress the respiratory drive and suppress cough.
1
The onset of action of the immediate release form of hydromorphone is achieved in 15-20 minutes and having a lasting effect for 3-4 hours while the extended-release form onset of action is of 6 hours lasting for about 13 hours.

### Actions

Binder

### General Function

Binds water, Ca(2+), Na(+), K(+), fatty acids, hormones, bilirubin and drugs (Probable). Its main function is the regulation of the colloidal osmotic pressure of blood (Probable). Major zinc transporter in plasma, typically binds about 80% of all plasma zinc (PubMed:19021548). Major calcium and magnesium transporter in plasma, binds approximately 45% of circulating calcium and magnesium in plasma (By similarity). Potentially has more than two calcium-binding sites and might additionally bind calcium in a non-specific manner (By similarity). The shared binding site between zinc and calcium at residue Asp-273 suggests a crosstalk between zinc and calcium transport in the blood (By similarity). The rank order of affinity is zinc > calcium > magnesium (By similarity). Binds to the bacterial siderophore enterobactin and inhibits enterobactin-mediated iron uptake of E.coli from ferric transferrin, and may thereby limit the utilization of iron and growth of enteric bacteria such as E.coli (PubMed:6234017). Does not prevent iron uptake by the bacterial siderophore aerobactin (PubMed:6234017)
