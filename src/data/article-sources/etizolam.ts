## Subjective Experience

Etizolam is my sleep aid of choice. I use it just occasionally, usually to kill a stim or a
trip. It works well, with little or no lag the following day. It comes on quickly, and is
effective even at 0.5mg.

However, on one occasion I consumed 2mg, and I learned the meaning of the term
hypnotic. I slept for 14 hours, and when I awoke, I was zombified. I felt good; floating
in a zoned-out headspace. A walk outside was extremely pleasant and the day passed
in a splendid haze. Despite this seductive positivity I instinctively knew that, given its
addictive tendencies, this was not a habit to get into.

That story perhaps serves as a reminder of the general nature of benzodiazepines:
overdose is a very serious hazard and many people struggle with long term addiction,
which is extremely difficult to shake off. Be careful.

Note: The general consensus appears to be that 1mg of etizolam equates to about
10mg of diazepam.

**Fatal [overdose](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Overdose) may occur when [thienodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thienodiazepines) are combined with other [depressants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressants) such as [opiates](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opiates) , [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) , [barbiturates](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Barbiturates) , [gabapentinoids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Gabapentinoids) , [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) or other [GABAergic substances](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GABA#GABA_receptors) .**
 
It is strongly discouraged to combine these substances, particularly in [common](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Common) to [heavy](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Heavy) doses.
**Etizolam** (also known as **Etilaam** , **Etizest** , **Depas** , and many others) is a novel [depressant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressant) substance of the [thienodiazepine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thienodiazepine) class. Etizolam is chemically related to [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) and acts by binding to [GABA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GABA) receptors in the brain.

Etizolam is not commonly prescribed. It has been sold as a [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) online and is commonly used as a substitute for pharmaceutical benzodiazepines like [alprazolam](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alprazolam) ( **Xanax** ) or [diazepam](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Diazepam) ( **Valium** ). Etizolam is commonly found in pellet or pill form, laid on blotter paper, dissolved in propylene glycol or as a pure powder.

[Subjective effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effects) include [anxiety suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety_suppression) , [disinhibition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Disinhibition) , [muscle relaxation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_relaxation) , [sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation) , and [euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Euphoria) . Etizolam is commonly administered [orally](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Oral) and [sublingually](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sublingual) due to the high bioavailability of these routes.

As with [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) , [the sudden discontinuation of thienodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thienodiazepine#Discontinuation) can be dangerous or even life-threatening for long-term or heavy users. As a result, individuals who are physically dependent on this substance are advised to [taper](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Taper) their dose by gradually lowering the amount taken each day over a prolonged period of time instead of stopping use abruptly.

Due to its high abuse and addiction potential, it is highly advised to use proper [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Harm_reduction_practices) if using this substance. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

## History and culture

Etizolam first appeared on the online [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) market in 2011. Since then its popularity has steadily increased. This likely owes itself to both its low cost and its abundance, and the highly dependence-forming and addictive nature that it shares with recreationally-used benzodiazepines.

Etizolam differs from most other research chemicals in that it is approved and actively prescribed as a medical treatment for anxiety in many countries around the world, commonly under brand names like *Etilaam* and *Etizest* . Its origins as a medical drug are unclear, although medical papers citing its use in the treatment of anxiety have been documented as early as the 1990s.

## Chemistry

Etizolam is a structural relative of [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) , whereby the benzene ring has been replaced by a thiophene ring, classifying it as a [thienodiazepine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thienodiazepine) . Thiophene is a five membered aromatic ring with one sulfur atom. Etizolam contains a thiophene ring fused to a diazepine ring, which is a seven membered ring with the two nitrogen constituents located at R 1 and R 4 . This forms the thienodiazepine core of etizolam. An ethyl chain is bound to this bicyclic structure at R 7 . Additionally, a R 2 ' chlorine-substituted phenyl ring is bound to this structure at R 5 .

Etizolam also contains a methylated triazole ring fused to and incorporating R 1 and R 2 of its diazepine ring. Etizolam shares this fused triazole ring substitution with certain [benzodiazepine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine) drugs, called triazolobenzodiazepines, distinguished by the suffix "-zolam".

## Pharmacology

Thienodiazepines produce a variety of effects by binding to the benzodiazepine binding site (formerly referred to as the BZD receptor) at the GABA-A receptor complex, magnifying the efficicacy and effects of the neurotransmitter [gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA)](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GABA) by increasing its ability to bind more readily to its own [receptors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Receptor) . This is known as positive allosteric modulation. As this site is the most prolific inhibitory receptor set within the brain, its modulation results in the [sedating](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedating) (or [calming effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety_suppression) ) of etizolam on the nervous system.

## Subjective effects

Anecdotal reports suggest that in terms of its relative potency, 1 mg of etizolam is approximately equivalent to 0.5 mg of [alprazolam](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alprazolam) ( **Xanax** ), 0.5 mg of [clonazepam](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Clonazepam) ( **Klonopin** ), or 10 mg of [diazepam](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Diazepam) ( **Valium** ). It is often compared to a less potent and [sedating](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation) version of [alprazolam](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alprazolam) in terms of the speed of its onset, total duration, and recreational effect.

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation)** - Etizolam is sedating in a rapid-acting fashion. At higher doses, this can lead users to suddenly feel as if they are extremely sleep deprived and have not slept for days, forcing them to sit down and generally feel as if they are constantly on the verge of passing out instead of engaging in physical activities. This sense of sleep deprivation increases proportional to dosage and eventually becomes powerful enough to force a person into complete unconsciousness.
- **[Muscle relaxation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_relaxation)** This effect can be described as similar to [diazepam](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Diazepam) , albeit mild-moderately less prominent depending on the dose. Low doses around 0.5-1mg typically cause an effect comparable to [alprazolam](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alprazolam) .
- **[Physical euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria)**
- **[Motor control loss](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motor_control_loss)**
- **[Respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression)**
- **[Increased libido](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_libido)**
- **[Seizure suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizure_suppression)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Appetite enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Appetite_enhancement)** - This effect is not particularly prominent, but is reported to occur in some people. It can have a synergistic effect when combined with [cannabis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cannabis) .
- **[Dizziness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dizziness)**
- **[Temporary erectile dysfunction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Temporary_erectile_dysfunction)** ### Paradoxical effects
 
- Paradoxical reactions to [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) such as increased seizures (in epileptics), aggression, increased anxiety, violent behavior, loss of impulse control, irritability and suicidal behavior sometimes occur (although they are rare in the general population, with an incidence rate below 1%). These paradoxical effects occur with greater frequency in recreational abusers, individuals with mental disorders, children, and patients on high-dosage regimes. Although not formally studied, thienodiazepines are assumed to share this risk. ### Cognitive effects
 
- - **[Anxiety suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety_suppression)**
- **[Disinhibition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Disinhibition)**
- **[Cognitive euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_euphoria)** - This effect is generally produced only at high doses, and is thought to arise largely from the release of pre-existing [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) in the user. Many users report not feeling any pleasurable or euphoric sensations from [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) or [thienodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thienodiazepines) like etizolam at all.
- **[Compulsive redosing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Compulsive_redosing)** - Compulsive redosing likely occurs due to the rapid way in which the substance produces its anxiety-relieving, relaxing and sometimes euphoric effects before quickly dropping off. It can be made worse due to the [memory suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Memory_suppression) it produces which can lead the user forgetting they have taken any at all, which can lead to a cycle that leads to a dangerous [amnesic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amnesia) blackout state.

- **[Delusions of sobriety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions#Delusions_of_sobriety)** - This is the false belief that one is perfectly sober despite obvious evidence to the contrary such as severe cognitive impairment and an inability to fully communicate with others. It most commonly occurs at high to heavy dosages.

- **[Motivation suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motivation_suppression)**
- **[Emotion suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Emotion_suppression)** - Although this compound primarily suppresses anxiety, it also dulls other emotions in a manner which is distinct but less intensive than that of [antipsychotics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antipsychotic) .
- **[Sleepiness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sleepiness)** ### After effects
 
- - **[Rebound anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety)** - Rebound anxiety is a commonly observed effect with [anxiety relieving](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety_suppression) substances like [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) and etizolam . It typically corresponds to the total duration spent under the substance's influence along with the total amount consumed in a given period, an effect which can easily lend itself to cycles of dependence and addiction.

- **[Residual sleepiness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sleepiness)** - While etizolam can be used as an effective [sleep-inducing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hypnotic) aid, its effects may persist into the morning afterwards, which may lead users to feeling "groggy" or "dull" for up to a few hours.

## Toxicity and harm potential

Etizolam likely has a low toxicity relative to dose. However, it is potentially [lethal](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression) when mixed with [depressants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressants) like [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) or [opioids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioids) .

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) such as [volumetric dosing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Volumetric_dosing) when using this substance.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

Like most benzodiazepines, etizolam is considered to be highly addictive with a high potential for abuse.

In one study in which multiple doses of either etizolam or lorazepam were administered to rat neurons, tolerance to the anticonvulsant effects of lorazepam but not to etizolam was observed. Etizolam therefore has a reduced liability to induce tolerance, and dependence when compared with classic benzodiazepines.

Tolerance will, however, develop to the sedative-hypnotic effects within a couple of days of continuous use. After cessation, the tolerance returns to baseline in 7 - 14 days. However, in certain cases this may take significantly longer in a manner which is proportional to the duration and intensity of one's long-term usage.

[Thienodiazepine discontinuation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine#Discontinuation) is notoriously difficult and potentially life-threatening for heavy or long-term users. There is an increased risk of seizure following discontinuation of thienodiazepines. Withdrawal symptoms or rebound symptoms may occur after ceasing usage abruptly following a few weeks or longer of steady dosing, and may necessitate a gradual dose reduction. For more information on tapering from thienodiazepines in a controlled manner, please see [this guide](http://www.benzo.org.uk/manual/bzcha02.htm) . Substances which lower the seizure threshold such as [tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol) should be avoided during withdrawal.

Etizolam presents cross-tolerance with all [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine) and [thienodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thienodiazepine) , meaning that after its consumption all benzo and thienodiazepines will have a reduced effect.

### Overdose

Thienodiazepine overdose may occur when taken in extremely heavy quantities or concurrently with other depressants. This is particularly dangerous with other GABAergic depressants such as [barbiturates](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Barbiturate) and [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) since they work in a similar fashion, but bind to distinct allosteric sites on the GABA A receptor, thus their effects potentiate one another. Thienodiazepine increase the frequency in which the chlorine ion pore opens on the GABA A receptor while barbiturates increase the duration in which they are open, meaning when both are consumed, the ion pore will open more frequently and stay open longer . Thienodiazepine overdose is a medical emergency that may lead to a coma, permanent brain injury or death if not treated promptly and properly.

Symptoms of a thienodiazepine overdose may include severe [thought deceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_deceleration) , [slurred speech](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Language_suppression) , [confusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Confusion) , [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) , [respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression) , coma or death. Thienodiazepine overdoses may be treated effectively in a hospital environment, with generally favorable outcomes. Thienodiazepine overdoses are sometimes treated with [flumazenil](/w/index.php?title=Flumazenil&action=edit&redlink=1) , a GABA A antagonist . However, care is primarily supportive in nature.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **[Depressants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressants)** ( *[1,4-Butanediol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/1,4-Butanediol) , [2-methyl-2-butanol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2-methyl-2-butanol) , [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) , [barbiturates](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Barbiturates) , [GHB](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GHB) / [GBL](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GBL) , [methaqualone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methaqualone) , [opioids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioids)* ) - This combination can result in dangerous or even fatal levels of [respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression) . These substances potentiate the [muscle relaxation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_relaxation) , [sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation) and [amnesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amnesia) caused by one another and can lead to unexpected loss of consciousness at high doses. There is also an increased risk of vomiting during unconsciousness and death from the resulting suffocation. If this occurs, users should attempt to fall asleep in the [recovery position](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Recovery_position) or have a friend move them into it.
- **[Dissociatives](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociatives)** - This combination can result in an increased risk of vomiting during unconsciousness and death from the resulting suffocation. If this occurs, users should attempt to fall asleep in the [recovery position](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Recovery_position) or have a friend move them into it.
- **[Stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants)** - It is dangerous to combine thienzodiazepines with [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) due to the risk of excessive intoxication. Stimulants mask the [sedative](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation) effect of thienzodiazepines, which is the main factor most people consider when determining their level of intoxication. Once the stimulant wears off, the effects of thienzodiazepines will be significantly increased, leading to intensified [disinhibition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Disinhibition) . If combined, one should strictly limit themselves to only dose a certain amount of thienzodiazepines per hour. This combination can also potentially result in severe dehydration if hydration is not monitored.

## Effects
Etizolam is a research chemical with anti-anxiety, anticonvulsant, sedative and sleep-inducing properties.
As it is a little-researched substance, only vague information is available regarding its effect.
Taking benzodiazepines increases the effectiveness of the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) at the GABA-A receptor. This triggers sedative (calming), hypnotic, anxiolytic (anxiety-relieving), anticonvulsant (anticonvulsant) and muscle-relaxing effects in the body. Benzodiazepines have a depressant effect on the central nervous system. The flow of information in the brain between the brain cells (neurons) is thereby reduced / disturbed and feelings and perceptions are dampened.
The breakdown of the individual active ingredients of benzodiazepines in the body is age-dependent and therefore varies from person to person.

## Dosage
0.75 mg etizolam corresponds to 10 mg diazepam

## Risks

### Short-term Risks
There is little information available on risks, toxicity, side effects and long-term consequences. Therefore, the general information on benzodiazepines applies:
When mixing with other downers (alcohol, GHB/GBL, heroin) there is a risk of respiratory paralysis!
Taking benzodiazepines can cause numerous undesirable side effects. In addition, regular and long-term use carries a very high risk of physical and psychological dependence. Benzodiazepines should only be taken as prescribed by a doctor and only for a short period of time (max. 4-6 weeks). Longer-term use should be discussed with the treating specialist. The dosages and duration of action of the individual benzodiazepines differ considerably.
Side effects of benzodiazepines may be as follows: Prolonged fatigue, gastrointestinal problems, impaired reactions, hypersensitivity reactions, headaches, dizziness, motor difficulties, visual disturbances, slowed breathing, muscle weakness, confusion, sexual dysfunction, aggression, outbursts of anger, restlessness, random movements, allergies, skin problems/rashes and speech and movement disorders. Some benzodiazepines can cause seizures in epileptics.

### Long-term Risks
Regular and long-term use can lead to psychological and physical dependence (very high dependence potential). Immediate discontinuation of the drug after prolonged use can lead to negative withdrawal symptoms (including dizziness, physical weakness, inner restlessness, tremors, sleep disturbances, headaches, sweating, nausea, hallucinations and depression).
In addition, seizures and memory disorders/loss and listlessness (hangover effects) can occur. In case of possible dependence, withdrawal should be discussed with a doctor beforehand and the withdrawal should be medically accompanied. It is extremely important that the dose is reduced gradually.

## Safer Use
- If medicines are obtained on the black market or on the internet and not from a pharmacy/medical facility, the contents are unclear. Have the medicine tested for the exact ingredients in a drug check!
- Do not rely on dosage information from colleagues who regularly use benzodiazepines. Due to habituation or dependence, their doses can be much higher and fatal for new users.
- Blisters of counterfeits may look identical to the original packaging.
- The simultaneous consumption of depressant substances such as alcohol, ketamine, GHB/GBL, nitrous oxide, opioids and/or other benzodiazepines is dangerous as there is an increased risk of vomiting and unconsciousness. The risk of suffocation is high!

Etizolam is a benzodiazepine-like drug that provides sedation, euphoria, and anxiety-reduction. It has been used medically in some regions for issues like anxiety, depression, insomnia, and panic disorder.

The substance is currently used by many people in non-medical settings, with etizolam being purchased online.

Most of the issues with the drug arise from excessive sedation, memory loss, and disinhibition. If a high strong+ dose is used or it is combined with other depressants, it could be very physically dangerous.

**Etizolam** is a research chemical analogue of the [benzodiazepine](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/Benzodiazepines) class of drugs - the benzene ring being replaced by a thiophene ring, making it a thienodiazepine. The drug largely shares the effect profile of benzodiazepine drugs (being both hypnotic and anxiolytic), however studies have shown some major differences between etizolam and the more traditional benzos used for treatments; it suffers much less from a rapid build-up of tolerance, and also has a larger range of observed side-effects with abuse.

## History

The availability of Etizolam in the more general research chemical scene began around 2011, and attention has only increased since. Its prevalence is probably due to both the low cost of the drug (with 500-1000 standard doses costing around £100, and is available in bulk powder form for even less), and the highly addictive nature it shares with benzodiazepines.

Though relatively new to the recreational research chemical scene, etizolam differs from most other research chemicals in that it is actually approved and actively prescribed as a medical treatment for anxiety in many countries around the world (such as India) under brand names such as Etilaam and Etizest. Its origins as a medical drug are actually very unclear, though medical papers citing its use in the treatment of anxiety are recorded as early as the 90s.

| Common | 1-2mg |
| Strong | 2-4mg |
| Heavy | 4mg+ |

## Duration

Note: Duration can be significantly longer with higher doses.

| Onset | 20-60 Minutes |
| --- | --- |
| Total | 5-8 hours |

## Effects

### Positive

- Anti-Anxiety

- Relaxation

- A Sense of Well Being

### Neutral

- Appetite fluctuation

- Drowsiness

### Negative

- Memory loss

- Blackout potential

- Motor skill impairment

- Headaches

- Dizziness

- Nausea

- Lethargy

- Depression

- Irritability, aggression, rage

- Personality changes

- Emotional and social dissociation or derealization (long term)

### Long Term Effects

- The effects of long-term Etizolam, as with benzodiazepine use include drug dependence as well as the possibility of adverse effects on cognitive function, physical health, and mental health.

- There are a number of side-effects associated with addiction to benzodiazepines such as depression and flu-like symptoms, though occurring in only a small amount of people.

- In some users, particular with abuse Etizolam has been shown to cause blepharospasm.

- In very rare cases, Etizolam has been responsible for skin lesions in abusers.

## Harm Reduction

- When on high doses of depressants, users are likely to black out and potentially hurt themselves through misadventure. If you are taking a hypnotic dose of Etizolam, it is best to confine yourself to your bed.

- Some users report Etizolam as given to compulsive redosing, especially when a user is 'blacked out'. To avoid this, keep doses low and be wary of reduced inhibitions while under the influence.

### Interactions

As with other depressants, Etizolam should not be combined with any other CNS depressants (such as [alcohol](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/Alcohol)), at the risk of respiratory depression, which can lead to death.

See the [Drug combinations](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/Drug_combinations) chart for more information.

## Chemistry and Pharmacology

Etizolam is absorbed fairly rapidly, with peak plasma levels achieved between 30 minutes and 2 hours. It has a mean elimination half life of about 3.5 hours. Etizolam acts as a full agonist at the benzodiazepine receptor to produce its range of therapeutic and adverse effects. In addition, etizolam, unlike most other benzodiazepines, has prolactogenic effects, leading to an increase in blood levels of prolactin, which is a protein that in humans is best known for its role in enabling female mammals to produce milk.

During a controlled clinical trial that compared the effectiveness of etizolam and several benzodiazepines for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder, it was found that etizolam became more effective over time, implying a type of reverse tolerance.

The LD50 of Etizolam is currently unknown.

*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etizolam*

Etizolam is a thienodiazepine derivative which is a benzodiazepine analog. The etizolam molecule differs from a benzodiazepine in that the benzene ring has been replaced by a thiophene ring and triazole ring has been fused, making the drug a thienotriazolodiazepine.
Although a thienodiazepine, etizolam is clinically regarded as a benzodiazepine because of its mode of action via the benzodiazepine receptor and directly targeting GABAA allosteric modulator receptors.
It possesses anxiolytic, amnesic, anticonvulsant, hypnotic, sedative and skeletal muscle relaxant properties.
It was patented in 1972 and first approved for medical use in Japan in 1984.
As of April 2021, the export of etizolam has been banned in India.

## Medical uses

Short-term treatment of insomnia.
Anxiety disorders such as OCD and generalized anxiety disorder, mostly as a short-term medication to be used purely on an at-need basis

## Side effects

Long term use may result in blepharospasms, especially in women. Doses of 4 mg or more may cause anterograde amnesia.
In rare cases, erythema annulare centrifugum skin lesions have resulted.

### Tolerance, dependence and withdrawal

Abrupt or rapid discontinuation from etizolam, as with benzodiazepines, may result in the appearance of the benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome, including rebound insomnia. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome, a rare event in benzodiazepine withdrawal, has been documented in a case of abrupt withdrawal from etizolam. This is particularly relevant given etizolam's short half-life relative to benzodiazepines such as diazepam resulting in a more rapid drug level decrease in blood plasma levels.
In a study that compared the effectiveness of etizolam, alprazolam, and bromazepam for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder, all three drugs retained their effectiveness over 2 weeks, but etizolam became more effective from 2 weeks to 4 weeks.  Administering .5 mg etizolam twice daily did not induce cognitive deficits over 3 weeks when compared to placebo.
When multiple doses of etizolam, or lorazepam, were administered to rat neurons, lorazepam caused downregulation of alpha-1 benzodiazepine binding sites (tolerance/dependence), while etizolam caused an increase in alpha-2 benzodiazepine binding sites (reverse tolerance to anti-anxiety effects).  Tolerance to the anticonvulsant effects of lorazepam was observed, but no significant tolerance to the anticonvulsant effects of etizolam was observed. Etizolam therefore has a reduced liability to induce tolerance, and dependence, compared with classic benzodiazepines.
Etizolam may represent a possible anxiolytic of choice with reduced liability to produce tolerance and dependence after long-term treatment of anxiety and stress syndromes.

## Pharmacology

Etizolam, a thienodiazepine derivative, is absorbed fairly rapidly, with peak plasma levels achieved between 30 minutes and 2 hours. It has a mean elimination half-life of about 3.4 hours. Etizolam possesses potent hypnotic properties, and is comparable with other short-acting benzodiazepines.  Etizolam acts as a positive allosteric modulator of the GABAA receptor by agonizing the receptor's benzodiazepine site.
According to the Italian prescribing information sheet, etizolam belongs to a new class of diazepines, thienotriazolodiazepines. This new class is easily oxidized, rapidly metabolized, and has a lower risk of accumulation, even after prolonged treatment. Etizolam has an anxiolytic action about 6-8 times greater than that of diazepam. Etizolam produces, especially at higher dosages, a reduction in time taken to fall asleep, an increase in total sleep time, and a reduction in the number of awakenings. During tests, there were no substantial changes in deep sleep; however, it may reduce REM sleep. In EEG tests of healthy volunteers, etizolam showed some similar characteristics to tricyclic antidepressants.
Etizolam's main metabolites in humans are alpha-hydroxyetizolam and 8-hydroxyetizolam.  alpha-Hydroxyetizolam is pharmacologically active and has a half-life of approximately 8.2 hours.

## Interactions

Itraconazole and fluvoxamine slow down the rate of elimination of etizolam, leading to accumulation of etizolam, therefore increasing its pharmacological effects. Carbamazepine speeds up the metabolism of etizolam, resulting in reduced pharmacological effects.

## Overdose

Cases of intentional suicide by overdose using etizolam in combination with GABA agonists have been reported. Etizolam has a lower LD50 than certain benzodiazepines. Flumazenil, a GABA antagonist agent used to reverse benzodiazepine overdoses, inhibits the effect of etizolam as well as classical benzodiazepines such as diazepam and chlordiazepoxide.
Etizolam overdose deaths are rising in Scotland, especially among women - for instance, the National Records of Scotland report on drug-related deaths have, "have increased significantly in Scotland in recent years, with a much greater percentage increase in deaths among women than among men". By 2018, 1,187 overdoses were officially recorded, a 107% increase from 2008, this means that this has been the highest peak to date. Although, men still outnumber women in drug-related deaths.

## Society and culture

### Brand names

Etilaam,  Sedekopan, Etizest, Etizex, Pasaden or Depas

### Legal status

#### International drug control conventions

In 1990, it was recommended that Etizolam not be placed under international control. However, this attitude has changed due to increased abuse. On December 13, 2019, the World Health Organization recommended Etizolam be placed in Schedule 4 of the 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances. This recommendation was followed by the placement of Etizolam into Schedule IV in March 2020.

#### Australia

Etizolam is not used medically in Australia but has been found in counterfeit Xanax pills.

#### Denmark

Etizolam is controlled in Denmark under the Danish Misuse of Drugs Act.

#### Germany

Etizolam was controlled in Germany in July 2013 but is not used medically.

#### Italy

Etizolam is licensed for the treatment of anxiety, insomnia and neurosis as a prescription-only medication.

#### India

In India, it is a Narcotics prescription-only (NRx) medication used for anxiety disorders, sometimes in combination with other drugs, i.e. the beta blocker propranolol.
United Kingdom
In the UK, etizolam has been classified as a Class C drug by the May 2017 amendment to The Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 along with several other designer benzodiazepine drugs.

#### United States

Etizolam is not authorized by the FDA for medical use in the U.S. As of March 2016, etizolam is a controlled substance in the following states: Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia (as Schedule IV, whereas all other states listed here prohibit it as a Schedule I substance), Louisiana, Mississippi, Texas, South Carolina, and Virginia. It is controlled in Indiana as of July 1, 2017. It is controlled in Ohio as of February 2018.
On December 23, 2022, the DEA announced it had begun consideration on the matter of placing Etizolam under temporary Schedule I status.
Later on July 25, 2023, the DEA published a pre-print notice that Etizolam would become temporarily scheduled as a Schedule I controlled substance from 26 July 2023 to 26 July 2025. On July 25, 2025, and effective the following day, the DEA extended the temporary scheduling until July 26, 2026.

### Misuse

Etizolam is a drug of potential misuse. Cases of etizolam dependence have been documented in the medical literature.  Since 1991, cases of etizolam misuse and addiction have substantially increased, due to varying levels of accessibility and cultural popularity. Pills being sold as Xanax or other benzodiazepines that are illicitly manufactured may often contain etizolam rather than their listed ingredient
