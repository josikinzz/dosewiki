**4-Acetoxy- *N* , *N* -dimethyltryptamine** (also known as **4-AcO-DMT** , **4-acetoxy-DMT** , ***O* -acetylpsilocin** , **psilacetin** , and " **synthetic mushrooms** ") is a novel lesser-known [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) substance of the [tryptamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tryptamine) class. It is structurally related to [psilocybin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocybin) and [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) , the active ingredient in [psilocybin mushrooms](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocybin_mushrooms) ("magic mushrooms"). 4-AcO-DMT is thought to produce its effects by binding to [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) [receptors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Receptors) in the brain; however, the precise mechanism is not known.

4-AcO-DMT was first synthesized in 1963 by [Albert Hofmann](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Hofmann) and Franz Troxler as part of a chemical investigation into psilocin analogs. However, it was not tested for psychoactivity during this time. It is unknown when it was first explored in humans. A paper authored by [David E. Nichols](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/David_E._Nichols) in 1999 proposed its potential use as an alternative to psilocybin for pharmacological research due to the lower cost of synthesis. Reports of recreational use began to surface shortly after its appearance on the online [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) market in the 2010s. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

[Subjective effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effects) include [geometric visual effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Geometry) , [time distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Time_distortion) , [enhanced introspection](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Introspection) , [euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Euphoria) , and [ego loss](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ego_loss) . 4-AcO-DMT's effects are considered to be nearly identical to psilocybin, with some subtle differences. It has been theorized to act as a [prodrug](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Prodrug) to [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) in a manner similar to [psilocybin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocybin) , which may account for this similarity. 4-AcO-DMT's classical psychedelic effects and favorable tolerability profile has led it to become popular among novel psychoactive substance users who seek mystical or [entheogenic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entheogenic) experiences. It is occasionally sold in capsules or pressed pills and marketed as "synthetic shrooms".

Very little data exists on the pharmacology, metabolism, and toxicity of 4-AcO-DMT. Although its toxicity profile is believed to be near-identical with psilocybin mushrooms (see [this section](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocybin_mushrooms#Toxicity_and_harm_potential) ), which are known to be physiologically non-toxic, there is no hard data to support this claim. It is highly advised to use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Harm_reduction_practices) if using this substance.

## History and culture

4-AcO-DMT and several other esters of psilocin were patented on January 16, 1963 by Sandoz Ltd. via Albert Hofmann & Franz Troxler. However, its pharmacology and subjective effects were not investigated. It is unknown when 4-AcO-DMT's effects in humans were first explored.

## Chemistry

4-AcO-DMT is a synthetic member of organic compounds known as [tryptamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tryptamines) . Tryptamines share a core structure that consists of a bicylic indole heterocycle attached at R 3 to a terminal amino group via an ethyl side chain. 4-AcO-DMT is substituted at R 4 of its indole heterocycle with an acetoxy (-AcO) functional group CH 3 COO−. It also contains two methyl groups CH 3 - bound to the terminal amine R N of the ethyl side chain.

4-AcO-DMT is the acetate ester analog of [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) ( **4-HO-DMT** ) and the N-substituted methyl homolog of [4-AcO-MET](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-AcO-MET) . It is the O-acetylated form of [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) , whereas psilocybin is the O-phosphorylated form.

## Pharmacology

Upon entering the body, *O* -acetylpsilocin, or 4-AcO-DMT, is deacetylated to psilocin by deacetylases/acetyltransferases during first-pass metabolism and during subsequent passes through the liver (evident as psilacetin is also active via parenteral routes of ingestion).

The [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) effects of 4-AcO-DMT are believed to come from its activity as a [partial agonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist#Agonists) for the [5-HT2A receptor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin#The_5-HT_system) . However, the role of these interactions and how they result in the [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) experience is the subject of ongoing scientific investigation.

Claims of subjective differences in effects between the acetylated and non-acetylated forms of psilocin vary: some users report that *O* -acetylpsilocin lasts slightly longer, whilst others report that it lasts for a considerably shorter time. Many users report less body load and nausea compared with psilocin. Some users find that the visual effects produced by *O* -acetylpsilocin more closely resemble those produced by DMT than those produced by psilocin or psilocybin. These differences could be possible if psilacetin is psychoactive in itself and not merely as a prodrug. Despite this, there have been no controlled clinical studies to distinguish among the phenomenological effects of psilacetin, psilocin, and psilocybin.

## Subjective effects

Users frequently describe 4-AcO-DMT as being extremely similar to psilocybin mushrooms. It is generally described as euphoric, gentle, warm, and colorful. Visuals are reported by some users to be brighter and more neon in a manner reminiscent of DMT. It is also reported to be less nauseating than psilocybin mushrooms, which may be due to the fact that it does not require digesting mushroom matter.

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation)** - 4-AcO-DMT is typically reported to be relaxing, stoning, and mildly sedating. This sense of sedation is often accompanied by [excessive yawning](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Excessive_yawning) and watery eyes.
- **[Perception of bodily heaviness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perception_of_bodily_heaviness)**
- **[Spontaneous bodily sensations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_bodily_sensations)** - The general "body high" of 4-AcO-DMT can be described as pleasurable, warm, soft, and all-encompassing tingling sensation. This maintains a consistent presence that steadily rises with the onset and hits its limit once the peak has been reached. Once the peak of the experience or sensation is reached it can produce feelings of pronounced [physical and cognitive euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Euphoria) along with tranquility, a sense of lethargy or sedation, or total immobilization depending on the dose.
- **[Tactile enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_enhancement)** - This effect is less prominent than with that of [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) or [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) but is still present and unique in its character. It is repeatedly described as feeling very primitive in its nature oftentimes with the small hairs on the user's arms or legs feeling slightly [itchy](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Itchiness) or even ticklish against the skin.
- **[Changes in felt bodily form](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Changes_in_felt_bodily_form)** - This effect is often accompanied by a sense of warmth and usually occurs around or directly after the peak of the experience. Users can feel as if they are physically part of or conjoined with other objects in a seamless continuity. This is usually reported as feeling comfortable, tranquil, and mindful, though it can also manifest in the form of bodily tension.
- **[Changes in felt gravity](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Changes_in_felt_gravity)**
- **[Nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea)** - This effect can be greatly lessened or even completely avoided if the individual has an empty stomach prior to ingestion. It is sometimes recommended that one either refrain from eating for approximately 6 to 8 hours beforehand or to eat a light meal 3 to 4 hours before if the user is feeling physically fatigued and undernourished. The nausea produced by 4-AcO-DMT is generally considered to be much less prominent than it is with [psilocybin mushrooms](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocybin#Psilocybin-containing_mushrooms) , perhaps owing to the fact that there is no fungal-matter the body has to digest when the isolated synthetic form is consumed.
- **[Temperature regulation suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Temperature_regulation_suppression)** - 4-AcO-DMT can cause fluctuations in the user's internal sense of temperature, which can manifest as sudden bouts of uncomfortable coldness or warmth, which is why a climate-controllable environment is strongly recommended.
- **[Muscle contractions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_contractions)** - The muscle contractions that can occur on 4-AcO-DMT tend to be transient and benign feeling in nature, compared to many other [tryptamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tryptamines) , [phenethylamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamines) and [lysergamides](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Lysergamides) .
- **[Muscle relaxation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_relaxation)**
- **[Excessive yawning](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Excessive_yawning)** - This effect seems to be uniquely pronounced among psilocin and related tryptamines. It can occur to a lesser degree on [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) and very rarely on psychedelic [phenethylamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamines) like [mescaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mescaline) . It typically occurs in conjunction with [watery eyes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Watery_eyes) .
- **[Watery eyes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Watery_eyes)**
- **[Frequent urination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Frequent_urination)**
- **[Gustatory enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Gustatory_enhancement)**
- **[Olfactory enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Olfactory_enhancement)**

- **[Pupil dilation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pupil_dilation)**
- **[Runny nose](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Runny_nose)**
- **[Increased salivation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_salivation)**
- **[Teeth grinding](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Teeth_grinding)** - This effect is considerably less intense when compared with substances like [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) when it occurs.
- **[Brain zaps](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Brain_zaps)** - This effect is uncommon and thought to only occur in those who are predisposed to them. It is much less prevalent and intense than those that occur with serotonin releasing agents such as [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) .
- **[Seizure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizure)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] - This is a rarely observed effect and is thought to primarily be a risk factor in those already predisposed to them, particularly while in physically taxing conditions such as being overheated, dehydrated, undernourished or fatigued. ### Visual effects

#### Geometry
 
The visual geometry of 4-AcO-DMT can be described as more similar in appearance to that of [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) , low-medium dose [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT) , and [ayahuasca](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ayahuasca) as opposed to [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) or [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) . It can be comprehensively described through its [variations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Geometry#Variations) as intricate in complexity, abstract in form, organic in style, structured in organization, brightly lit and multicolored in scheme, glossy in shading, soft in edges, large in size, slow in speed, smooth in motion, rounded in corners, non-immersive in-depth and consistent in intensity. They can be described as having a "natural" feel and, at higher doses, are significantly more likely to result in states of [Level 8B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Level_8B) visual geometry over [Level 8A](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Level_8A) .
 
#### Hallucinatory states
 
4-AcO-DMT produces a full range of high-level hallucinatory states in a fashion that is more consistent and reproducible than that of many other commonly used [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) . These effects generally include:
 
- **[Transformations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Transformations)**
- **[Machinescapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Machinescapes)** - This effect is a rare effect that typically only occurs at very strong to heavy doses, and not as consistently as with notably visual psychedelics like [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT) , [ETH-LAD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/ETH-LAD) , and [2C-P](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-P) , and atypical psychedelics like [salvia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Salvia) .
- **[Internal hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucination)** ( *[autonomous entities](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Autonomous_entities)* ; *[settings, sceneries, and landscapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Settings,_sceneries,_and_landscapes)* ; *[perspective hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perspective_hallucinations)* and *[scenarios and plots](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenarios_and_plots)* ) - This effect is very consistent in dark environments at appropriately high doses. They can be comprehensively described through their [variations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Internal_hallucinations#Variations) as lucid in believability, interactive in style, new experiences in content, autonomous in controllability, [geometry](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Geometry) -based in style and almost exclusively of a personal, religious, spiritual, science-fiction, fantasy, surreal, nonsensical or transcendental nature in their overall theme.
- **[External hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/External_hallucination)** ( *[autonomous entities](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Autonomous_entities)* ; *[settings, sceneries, and landscapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Settings,_sceneries,_and_landscapes)* ; *[perspective hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perspective_hallucinations)* and *[scenarios and plots](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenarios_and_plots)* ) - These are more common within dark environments and can be comprehensively described through their [variations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/External_hallucinations#Variations) as lucid in believability, interactive in style, new experiences in content, autonomous in controllability, geometry-based in style and almost exclusively of a personal, religious, spiritual, science-fiction, fantasy, surreal, nonsensical or transcendental nature in their overall theme. ### Cognitive effects
 
- The cognitive effects and general head space of 4-AcO-DMT are commonly described as extremely relaxing, profound and slow-paced in style when compared to other commonly used [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) , such as [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) or [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) , which have a distinct energetic and stimulating push. It is also generally regarded as being notably more lucid than [psilocybin mushrooms](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocybin#Psilocybin-containing_mushrooms) . 
- **[Analysis enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Analysis_enhancement)** - This effect is consistent in its manifestation with a tendency to be [outrospective](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Outrospection) in nature, but may also manifest as [introspection](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Introspection) depending on one's set and setting.
- **[Novelty enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Novelty_enhancement)**
- **[Immersion enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Immersion_enhancement)**
- **[Creativity enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Creativity_enhancement)**
- **[Conceptual thinking](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Conceptual_thinking)**
- **[Personal bias suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Personal_bias_suppression)**
- **[Multiple thought streams](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Multiple_thought_streams)**
- **[Emotion enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Emotion_enhancement)** - This effect can be described as being more prominent, consistent and profound when compared to other traditional psychedelics such as [mescaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mescaline) or [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) . This can lead to strong feelings of compassion, urgency and even completely sporadic moments of intense emotional significance that can also be periodically affected by [enhancement and suppression cycles](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Enhancement_and_suppression_cycles) .
- **[Simultaneous emotions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Simultaneous_emotions)**
- **[Empathy, affection, and sociability enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Empathy,_affection,_and_sociability_enhancement)** - This effect differs from [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) and other [entactogens](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entactogens) in that it isn't as central to the experience, feels less forced and more natural and is experienced at a less consistent rate. While the substance consistently produces heightened empathy and affection, sociability enhancement in particular only occurs rarely if at all due to the language and memory suppressing cognitive effects that accompany the experience.
- **[Language suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Language_suppression)** - This effect can be described as a perceived inability or general unwillingness to talk aloud despite feeling perfectly capable of formulating coherent thoughts within one's internal narrative. It is much more common among inexperienced users.
- **[Enhancement and suppression cycles](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Enhancement_and_suppression_cycles)** - This can be described as constant waves of extremely stimulated and profound thinking which are spontaneously surpassed in a cyclic fashion by waves of general thought suppression and mental intoxication. These two states seem to switch between each other in a consistent loop once every 20 to 60 minutes when present.
- **[Increased sense of humor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_sense_of_humor)** 
- **[Laughter fits](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Laughter_fits)**
- **[Increased music appreciation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_music_appreciation)**
- **[Cognitive euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_euphoria)**
- **[Memory suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Memory_suppression)** 
- **[Ego death](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ego_death)**
- **[Feelings of impending doom](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Feelings_of_impending_doom)** - This effect is usually only experienced during the [come up](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Duration#Come_up) phase but typically completely passes or subsides once the primary effects begin. It should be noted that this effect is relatively consistent and normal for psilocin and related [tryptamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tryptamines) which is why a [positive and well-informed mindset](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Set_and_setting) is key. Less regularly this aspect can also occur during the peak but will most often be met after with sensations of [euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_euphoria) and [rejuvenation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Rejuvenation) .
- **[Catharsis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Catharsis)**
- **[Rejuvenation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Rejuvenation)** - While this effect can occur spontaneously at any point, it typically follows a difficult phase of the experience, if not the entire experience itself.
- **[Thought connectivity](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_connectivity)**
- **[Thought deceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_deceleration)**
- **[Thought organization](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_organization)**
- **[Thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops)**
- **[Time distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Time_distortion)**
- **[Confusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Confusion)**
- **[Delusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusion)**
- **[Déjà vu](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/D%C3%A9j%C3%A0_vu)**
- **[Mindfulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mindfulness)**
- **[Ego replacement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ego_replacement)** - Although this effect is rare and more likely to occur with certain psychedelics like [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT) or [ayahuasca](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ayahuasca) , it can still occur spontaneously, typically with higher doses.
- **[Personality regression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Personality_regression)** - While this effect is not typically observed, it can still spontaneously manifest and is thought to depend primarily on the user's [set and setting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Set_and_setting) . ### Auditory effects
 
- - **[Auditory enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_enhancement)**
- **[Auditory distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_distortion)**
- **[Auditory hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_hallucination)** ### Multi-sensory effects
 
- - **[Synaesthesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Synaesthesia)** - In its fullest manifestation, this is a very rare and non-reproducible effect. Increasing the dose can increase the likelihood of this occurring, but seems to only be a prominent part of the experience among those who are already predisposed to synaesthetic states.
- **[Dosage independent intensity](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dosage_independent_intensity)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] ### Transpersonal effects
 
- - **[Existential self-realization](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Existential_self-realization)**
- **[Identity alteration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Identity_alteration)**
- **[Spirituality enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spirituality_enhancement)**
- **[Unity and interconnectedness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Unity_and_interconnectedness)**
### Combination effects

- **[Cannabis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cannabis)** - Cannabis is reported to strongly intensify the visual, sensory, and cognitive effects of 4-AcO-DMT. This combination should be used with extreme caution, as anecdotal reports suggest it increases the risk of experiencing a [bad trip](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bad_trip) , characterized by [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [confusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Confusion) , and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) .
- **[Dissociatives](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociatives)** - 4-AcO-DMT enhances the geometry, euphoria, dissociation and hallucinatory effects of all dissociatives, especially dissociative-induced [holes, spaces, and voids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_disconnection#Holes.2C_spaces_and_voids) . It may also significantly increase [internal hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucinations) , [confusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Confusion) , [nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea) , [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) and the chance of a [psychotic reaction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) .
- **[MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA)** - 4-AcO-DMT strongly amplifies the visual, physical and cognitive effects of [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) . The synergy between these substances is unpredictable, and it is best to start with lower doses than one would take for both substances individually. The toxicity risk of this combination is unknown, although there is some evidence that suggests this may increase the the neurotoxic effects of MDMA.
- **[Alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol)** - This combination is not typically advised due to alcohol’s potential to produce [dehydration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dehydration) , [nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea) , and [physical fatigue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_fatigue) , which can negatively affect the experience (for moderate to high doses). This combination is, however, considered to be reasonably safe in low doses and, when used responsibly, can often "take the edge off" the experience by dulling 4-AcO-DMT's psychedelic effects in a manner somewhat similar to benzodiazepines.
- **[Benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines)** - Depending on the dose, benzodiazepines can moderately to completely decrease the intensity of the cognitive, physical, and visual effects of a 4-AcO-DMT experience. They can be effective at mitigating [bad trips](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bad_trips) by reducing excessive anxiety and hallucinations. Caution is advised when obtaining them for this purpose due to their high abuse potential.

## Toxicity and harm potential

The toxicity and long-term health effects of 4-AcO-DMT have not been studied and the exact toxic dose is unknown. This is because 4-AcO-DMT is a [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) with a very short history of human usage. 4-AcO-DMT is assumed to have a similar safety profile as [psilocybin mushrooms](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocybin_mushrooms) due to their similar chemical structures, although there is currently no data to support this.

Anecdotal evidence suggests that there are no negative health effects attributed to simply trying 4-AcO-DMT by itself at low to moderate doses and using it very sparingly (but nothing can be completely guaranteed). [Independent research](https://www.google.com/) should always be done to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe before consumption.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this substance.

### Dependence and abuse potential

Like other psychedelics, 4-AcO-DMT is considered to be non-addictive with low potential for abuse.

Tolerance to the effects of 4-AcO-DMT is built almost immediately after ingestion. After that, it takes about 7 days for tolerance to return to baseline (in the absence of further consumption). 4-AcO-DMT produces cross-tolerance with all [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) , meaning that after the consumption of 4-AcO-DMT all psychedelics will have a reduced effect.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **[Lithium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_(medication))** - Lithium is commonly prescribed for the treatment of [bipolar disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder) . There is a large body of anecdotal evidence that suggests taking it with [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) significantly increases the risk of [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) and [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) . As a result, this combination is strictly discouraged.
- **[Cannabis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cannabis)** - Cannabis may have an unexpectedly strong and unpredictable synergy with the effects of 4-AcO-DMT. Caution is advised with this combination as it can significantly increase the risk of adverse psychological reactions like [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) , and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) . Users are advised to start off with only a fraction of their normal cannabis dose and take long breaks between hits to avoid unintentional overdose.
- **[Stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants)** - Stimulants like [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) , [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) or [methylphenidate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylphenidate) affect many parts of the brain and alter [dopaminergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) function. This combination can increase the risk of [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) , and [thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops) . This interaction may also result in an elevated risk of [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) . [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol)** - Tramadol is well-documented to lower the seizure threshold and [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) may act to trigger seizures in susceptible individuals. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

## Legal status

4-AcO-DMT is not listed under any international drug schedules such as the UN Convention on Psychotropic Substances. As a result, it exists in a legal grey area in many countries, meaning that while it is not specifically illegal, individuals may still be charged for its possession under certain circumstances such as under analogue laws and with the intent to sell or consume.

- **Australia** : 4-AcO-DMT can be considered an analog of psilocin, making it a Schedule 9 controlled substance in Australia under the Poisons Standard. A Schedule 9 substance is a substance which may be abused or misused, the manufacture, possession, sale or use of which should be prohibited by law except when required for medical or scientific research, or for analytical, teaching or training purposes with approval of Commonwealth and/or State or Territory Health Authorities.
- **Belgium** : 4-AcO-DMT is illegal to import in Belgium. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **Brazil** : 4-AcO-DMT is illegal to possess, produce, and sell as it is listed on Portaria SVS/MS nº 344.
- **Germany** : Because it is an ester of DMT, 4-AcO-DMT is controlled under Anlage I BtMG (Narcotics Act, Schedule I) as of January 24, 1974. It is illegal to manufacture, possess, import, export, buy, sell, procure or dispense it without a license.
- **Italy** : 4-AcO-DMT is illegal in Italy as it is an ester of an illegal substance. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **Japan** : 4-AcO-DMT is a controlled substance in Japan effective July 29th, 2015.
- **Sweden** : 4-AcO-DMT is a Schedule I controlled substance as of January 25, 2017
- **Switzerland** : 4-AcO-DMT could be considered an ester analog of Psilocin, which would make it illegal according to Buchstabe B.
- **Turkey:** 4-AcO-DMT is a classed as drug and is illegal to possess, produce, supply, or import.
- **United Kingdom** : 4-AcO-DMT is a Class A drug in the UK as it is an ester of the Class A drug psilocin.
- **United States** : 4-AcO-DMT is not scheduled in the United States. It may be considered an analogue of psilocin, a Schedule I drug under the Controlled Substances Act, which means the sale for human consumption or the use for non-medical or research purposes could be prosecuted as crimes under the Federal Analogue Act.
