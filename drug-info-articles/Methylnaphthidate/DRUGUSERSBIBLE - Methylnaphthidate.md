## Subjective Experience

The supply of HDMP-28 in the UK was strangled almost at birth. It was subjected to
a government TCDO shortly after it began to emerge on the markets, during the early
months of 2015. The same TCDO schedule also included a number of more
established chemicals, specifically 3,4-CTMP, EPH, IPPH, and PPH.

My own sample had been imported from Canada, by a fellow researcher, and was
forwarded after his own experiments had disappointed him.

I subsequently reported my experience, in December 2014, in the following terms:

```
My usual and preferred RoA is oral, but on this occasion, in an attempt to
reduce the anticipated period of residue stim, I decided to insufflate.
```

```
I snorted a line of between 5mg and 10mg. I then repeated this exercise
approximately every hour for the next few hours. It was a bit of a rough ride.
```
```
The experience itself was nice enough, but the body load was high.
```
```
The nose-burn was significant. It was much harsher for me than, for example,
MPA or 3-FPM. Perhaps I had too much, but later on, a mild headache
developed. I experienced the usual stim-dilated pupils, with more than the
usual jaw tension.
```
```
From reading other reports I was expecting a fairly short residue, but I found
it to be lengthy. Ending the tests at approximately 8pm, I was still feeling the
influence the following late-afternoon, and I had no sleep at all. This was way
too much for my tastes.
```
```
Certainly it was a buzz. It was intense, very strong, and long lasting, but I
think a lot of work is required to determine the correct dosage, and perhaps
the ideal RoA.
```
```
I hope this helps other potential researchers, to whom I would advise: be
particularly careful with the dose. Start lower than I did, and watch out for
compulsive redosing.
```
```
Whilst I cannot be absolutely certain that this chemical caused the general
malaise which followed this experiment, I have no intention of repeating the
exercise to confirm. Take it easy.
```
I never explored further, and indeed, I binned the remaining powder.

online source of a number of niche research chemicals
