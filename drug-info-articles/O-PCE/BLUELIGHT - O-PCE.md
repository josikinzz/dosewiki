IUPAC-Name: 2-(ethylamino)-2-phenylcyclohexan-1-one


Other names: O-PCE, Deschloroethylnorketamine, **eticyclidone**


CAS #: 4551-92-2


There has been some confusion over the identity of this compound due to strange naming by vendors. This thread will discuss the above compound.


It is structurally related to [deschloroketamine](https://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads/766127).

wtf, that's retarded. Why not just let the name and the picture match. They could just call it 2'-Oxo-PCE and everybody would get what it is.


Beyond sketchy imo.

They even said themselves that they know it's a PCE and not PCP analogue, maybe their supplier decided on that name and they have to stick with it.


One day they might change it, if it actually turns out to be 2'-Oxo-PCE and it becomes more popular, hopefully not everyone will copy that shitty brand name.

Exactly. Okay guys, I'm pretty sure I'm getting some of this as a sample. Can't say just yet but how I explained it too them if this one is a gem.....


Edit: Should be here with some MXE soon. I'll let you guys know what's up. Sek, how should I start dosing(I'm going to titration from one mg but if you say this should be far weaker than MXE, also remember I love aryl's and can handle high doses of them though clearly we don't know exactly what this guy will do...thanks!), what's your guess at its potency?

If I was sure that what I had is what they say, I'd say start with 1 mg too. PCE is actually more potent than PCP, and I don't think the ketone in that position is going to make it less potent, just shorten the duration - We will see. (maybe)

Do we know what difference the 3-MeO makes if we compare this thread's chem with MXE? Or PCP with 3-MeO-PCP for that matter as a helpful analogy? As far as I know the 3-MeO takes a little bit of the roughest edges off since I heard that PCE is far too wild and manic and I found 3-MeO-PCE only barely doable but still nice. Could be useless anecdotal information and completely a dosage control thing... but my warning would be to be a little more careful with it than with MXE since it may be a little bit more full on.


What do others have to say as far as educated guesses go? Uneducated guesses are I'm afraid more harmful than helpful?


As always, SAR is not linear but dependent on so many variables that far too often we are surprised by exception but it is the best we can do and it does not hurt to be careful.

Will surely do, I'll PM Sekio for his exact thoughts on potency. My guess 25-75mgs would be w good dose but they don't give out samples usually, so I have to make sure the grant they provide me with goes as far as it can!! But


Either way I'll most likely IM so looking for Ana hole is cake, but much who knows, husdcmmmmmmmmm

Go ahead and PM Sekio... I think your guess would be about right, the difference in potency between 3-MeO-PCP and PCP doesn't seem to be significantly (as in order of magnitude) different either.


Still why I wanted to post is: that still means you should use a decent 0.001 g scale and start very very low and work your way up steadily, allowing sufficient time in between each time. If you guys are the first to try it, then that is in some sense huge since you are pioneering, and curiosity or impatience have no place meeting the requirements for doing that safely.


**Never mind the mystery chemical factor involved until analytical spectrum results have been resolved!** (per batch at least until distribution reaches a more stable situation.)

Well, obviously I don't know, but I don't think that it's only the ketone that is responsible for ketamine's short action, so no, probably not. I think regular PCE is supposed to have the same duration as PCP - so rather long lived.


I'm looking forward to your report. Too bad you're not having it sent for independent testing but I get why. PLease be carefull and all that ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Anyway, arylcyclohexylamine SAR has proven to be a bit unpredictable imo. So most speculation can actually turn out to be wrong. Just think about NENK which was predicted to be a winner - but wasn't.


Comparing doses between the 3-methoxy and the non-methoxy arylcyclohexylamines actually gives a wierd picture too: 


PCP and PCE has a dosage of 5-10 mg,(PCE reported to be slightly stronger) and so does does 3-MeO-PCP, but 3-MeO-PCE turned out to have a dosage of 20-30 mg......That doesn't make sense at all really.

It would be nice to see some reagent results for this compound. If I is supposed to be like MXE I would worry some vendors may sell this as MXE due to the recent bans...

Are you sure about that 3-MeO-PCE dosage? I personally found about 10 mg I.M. to be enough for my tastes, maybe there is a little difference but no order of magnitudes here IME/IMO.


@your question: no not at all, was not aimed at anyone in particular, certainly can't think of something to bitch about right now ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png) I just meant that if we are going to speculate here on a compound we know all but nothing about which is not one of PD/BL's most appreciated things.. that I want people to give logical arguments for their claims. Guessing cause your gut says so is anti-HR, hence my warning.

Yeah, I'm absolutely sure, but I'll take a look through the 3-MeO-PCE thread to verify it, when I have time. But then again, I don't think the purity of the 3-MeO-PCE that was shortly available was ever verified, although there was really no reason to think it was cut either.

A good single dose of 3-meo-pce was 20-25 for me; 3-meo-pcp ~15mg for similar intensity (though different effects obviously).  3-meo-pce had a magical/trickster effect not present with 3-meo-pcp (which was just like trippy coke for me up till 10-12mg/and  fairly 'cold' dissociation above).  MXE often seemed to have a related 'magical' quality too - i assume cos it had the pce in it.  Seems weird for a vendor not to use 'pce' in the name of this with the association with mxe, and the more niche but still sought after 3-meo-pce.  I'm assuming this would be illegal in uk.

**Representative Ki values for popular arylcyclohexamines:** [[1](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0059334)]

**NMDA (Ki , nM): **

**Most potent;** **3-MeO-PCP:** ( 20 nM) >** PCP:** (59 nM) > **3 MeO PCE:** (61 nM) >** MXE:** (257 nM) > **Ketamine:** (661 nM) 


------------------------------------------------------------------------


**Affinity is not the only important value:**

Bioavailability of oral ketamine is around 20% [[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketamine)]. Oral bioavailability for PCP is 72% [[3](http://www.uptodate.com/contents/phencyclidine-pcp-intoxication-in-adults/abstract/11)] . Ketamine is a much more polar molecule than PCP. Polarity is perhaps an important factor. 

Here below you can see how polarity incrases for various arylcyclohexylamines.


**Image 1:**


![qc6LJ7o.jpg](https://www.bluelight.org/community/proxy.php?image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2Fqc6LJ7o.jpg%3F1&hash=4cf8b75fb4df419c7d9c5a41af4fb841)


[http://i.imgur.com/qc6LJ7o.jpg?1](http://i.imgur.com/qc6LJ7o.jpg?1)


PCP is less polar than 3 MeO PCP and should cross BBB much easier i guess. PCP is supposed to be less potent than 3 MEO PCP (by affinity) but the bioavailability maybe makes them equivalent.

2-Oxo-PCE is less polar than MXE and should cross BBB much easier. But the affinity for 3 Oxo PCE is not known. Therefore, it is impossible to guess the active dose anyway. 


------------------------------------------------------------------------


**Structure:**

Ketamine is structurally similar to PCM & N-Methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA). 


**Image 2:**


![VxGilVj.jpg](https://www.bluelight.org/community/proxy.php?image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2FVxGilVj.jpg%3F1&hash=424380feb26749063c537e93f72a1e4e)


[http://i.imgur.com/VxGilVj.jpg?1](http://i.imgur.com/VxGilVj.jpg?1)


And MXE is structurally similar to Ketamine & Glutamic acid.


**Image 3:**


![5oPx5Bp.jpg](https://www.bluelight.org/community/proxy.php?image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2F5oPx5Bp.jpg%3F1&hash=2caab55c5fb04b989aca80d56790f84c)


[http://i.imgur.com/5oPx5Bp.jpg?1](http://i.imgur.com/5oPx5Bp.jpg?1)


Structurally 2 Oxo PCE is something between Ketamine, MXE & PCE, and have not any similarities to NMDA or glutamic acid (that makes it much similar to PCE). 


------------------------------------------------------------------------


**Metabolism: **


If the molecule metabolises to 2,3-epoxide-2-OXO-PCE (hypothetically) [[4](http://what-when-how.com/human-drug-metabolism/dissociative-anaesthetics-pcp-metabolism-of-major-illicit-drugs-metabolism-of-major-illicit-drugs/)] then you well get 3-HO-2-OXO-PCE. which is also an MXE metabolite (more polar than MXE).


**Image 4:**


![XoyIgce.jpg](https://www.bluelight.org/community/proxy.php?image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2FXoyIgce.jpg%3F1&hash=82a7270f37e42dc2c42021f4dedf071d)


[http://i.imgur.com/XoyIgce.jpg?1](http://i.imgur.com/XoyIgce.jpg?1)


It is hard to say anything else about this molecule.

^^I totally agree. 25 mg insufflated was a perfect dose for me. And I agree as well with the "magical/trickster" thing that MXE and 3-MeO-PCE share. They definitely feel related. And yeah, it's so wierd with the calling it 3-f-pcp, and not 2-oxo-pce, I just don't get it, lol.


I just skimmed the 3-MeO-PCE thread, and from that I think I must correct my earlier dosage estimate of 3-MeO-PCE from 20-30 mg being a medium dose, to something more like 15-25 mg for most peeps, it obviously varies from person to person. But I don't think I was completely off anyway, when I said that it was less potent than 3-MeO-PCP.


Interesting post there, Friman1987. So you think polarity could be the major factor when it comes to potency? Makes sense when you put it up like that. 3-OH-PCE was a lot weaker than MXE though, but something else might be at play with that one.

probably.

Affinity and polarity should play an importent role.

I found a thread regarding 2'-Oxo-PCE on a Polish site and threw it in the translator. Here's a post I found may be relevant.


"2 - oxo - PCE was already once explored . Around the same period, which was founded METHOXETAMINE . In the notes I have written that it works very briefly 45-70 minutes. It has potent analgesic properties . NMDA receptors work poorly , mainly odzialuje receptors Opio . The dose of active starts from 20 mg . In practice , most people have to eat a lot more... 

Another frequent encountered name is deschloro -N - etylketamina ."


Obviously the translation is not smooth, but seems more narcotic like than dissociative.

yes, and what ROA? I'm very curious. Was it some Shulgin dose stuff or did you bomb a gram in an IV bolus (kidding?). I thought 2-oxo-PCM/deschlor-ketamine was active as a dissociative, just not particularly magical nor potent? So why ain't this active, then?


@OP: the comparisons to NMDA and glutamate are kind of spurious given the presence of oxygen atoms and the aromatic ring which glutamate/NMDA lack entirely... that comparison is one of the fudgiest i've seen. also, I somehow doubt it gets metabolised to 2- or 3- hydroxy compounds. maybe the 4', but I think the main route of elimination is excretion of the deethylated counterpart.

haha, It is not as precise as comparing gabapentin with GABA [[1](https://journals.prous.com/journals/dof/19992408/html/df240862/images/pregag1.gif)]. It is more like comparing 1,3-DMAA with amphetamine [[2](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/14/Amphetamine_vs_methylhexaneamine.png)] or methamphetamine with = propylhexedrine [[3](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9d/Propylhexedrine_and_methamphetamine.png/180px-Propylhexedrine_and_methamphetamine.png)].

Yes, most likely. I took that part of the metabolism just to show the similarities with MXE.

Para-hydroxylation affects phenethylamines, amphetamines, cathinones and many others compounds but i can't find the same thing for arylcyclohexylamines. The only thing i find is hydroxylation on 2 and 3 position. It is possibly because of the formation of 2,3-Epoxide-(R).

Is there anything known about the activity of this metabolite? As at least 3-HO-PCP is an opioid (confirmed, maybe it even was 3-HO-PCE, don't remember unfortunately), could this be one too?


Hopefully the 2'-Oxo-PCE makes a decent dissociative. I'm waiting impatiently for such a new one since the EU banned methoxetamine ... good old ketamine isn't bad either, but it's duration is just too short. MXE having a nearly day-long activity combined with the 5-HT made it a brilliant mood-enhancer (something I won't recommend to anyone, but it worked great for me).

2-​(ethylamino)-​2-​phenyl-​cyclohexanone


CAS : 85232-21-2

Yes it's the same thing in this case and yepp been dabbeling a bit with it. No time to write that much about it but it's really interesting, though you have to go up in doses for it to bloom. Will try to come back and write somethings about my experiences.

From what I can recall from that hazy time was that this Chem(2-oxo-PCP), had some effect at 35-100mgs when administered IM, but I was a bad boy, and for some of the later trials was using other disscociatives. IDK if what I had even was the real deal as no true testing for identification was done.... I do remember some effects, but as I titratied up I was busy, and had other better chemicals to toy with. Once I reached the higher doses there wasn't a to left as I had a little under a gram, but I guess only time can tell us...!

Please be careful with this chemical. I've tried it at 28 mg the first time. It was definitely the real deal, NMR-tested fluffy powder, 94% purity the rest being ethylamine hydrochloride. I was going to try 20 mg expecting a weak or maybe moderately strong dose. When the balance showed 28 mg, I decided "what the hell, I'll just give it a try". That was at 10 p.m. Several minutes later my body was so numb I could probably have stood surgery without any further anesthetics, my vision strongly distorted and my mind increasingly dissociated. I was still able to perform simple tasks but only with a lot of effort. Whenever I closed my eyes and lay down, I fell into a (quite shallow) hole for a few minutes. This was comparable to 60-80 mg of MXE, I guess, although I don't usually dose it that high. At 2 a.m. the intensity had slightly lessened and I remember that I had a dentist's appointment in the morning. Sleep came easily and I woke in a good mood. However, especially when biking to the dentist I realized that I still had residual effects, mostly motoric and anesthetic (which came quite handy during my dentist's appointment).


I retried O-PCE at 8 mg and found that to be a nice, mellow dose, reminiscent of 15-20 mg MXE. I had mostly come down several hours later when I went to sleep and didn't feel any residual effects in the morning. So I really don't think that 35-100 mg is the right dose range. I'd rather say it's probably around 5-35 mg, depending on what you're trying to achieve.

After reading up on Mirtazapine's pharmacology and following from what you say I'd dare an educated guess that it should be quite safe to combine with 1 mg of O-PCE. I doubt whether you will notice 1 mg of it at all, even if the required dose is lowered by the additional Mirtazapine. However, there are no guarantees there...

The 8mg is what is most concerning; it could be a sign that it is similar in dosage to 3-meo-pcp; with that I would use about 5mg to get a peaceful state. With this in mind, and harm reduction being a key thing; starting at 1mg and working my way up will be the way I'm going. Here is my question:

Would even 1mg be considered a safe starting dose or should it be started at an even lower dose to account for mirtazapine's odd effects?

^ well, NMR-chemist made an educated guess about the safety, but what Dresden wanted to say is that you can never know for sure with RCs how they will interact. I guess he could have written it a bit "nicer" but that's what he was getting at...

Guys, I have given this some thought and I'd like to propose the name "Phenoxetamine" for this. It is dissimilar to any other RC name, it makes sense as its Methoxetamine with the methoxy taken away or Tiletaminer with the Thienyl swapped out for Phenyl and the lay person immediately has the expectation that its somewhere in the Methoxetamine/Tiletamine ballpark, which it IS.


For code I like O-PCE best. Its bullshit to link this to ketamine or invoke expectations of fluorines, methoxies and piperidyls that aren't there.


Can I hear some opinions on the name **Phenoxetamine**? I think its meaningful to the lay person, the expert and the vendor. I think the name would be more commercially viable too, as it rolls off the tongue and *rightfully* invokes the image of a Methoxetamine successor.

Why must we come up with a nickname for something with such a short and easy abbreviation in the first place? O-PCE is extremely easy to say and only takes a second longer than PCE. But I could just be trippin. If their WERE going to be a nickname though, I give you credit that I would agree with that one.

O-PCE is a word to the wise, so is Eticyclidone (which I think is very elegant too) as Eticyclidine is not something the average user is at all familiar with. Phenoxetamine has that ring of methoxetamine, of ketamine and eticyclidine, known players in the field. It would be far more instructive just by name than an abbreviation would be. Theres already so much alphabet soup, lay people cant visualize the chemistry behind the abbreviations so a word with a familiar ring gives them more to hold onto.


Its also commercially interesting because you correctly appeal to famous and enjoyed drug names.  This is that I hated about "MXP" its suggests its related to MXE but it has a different effects and more importantly, safety profile. First member of its class, diphenidine, killed a bluelighter when it was just out and mindfucked more than a few veterans. To me MXP would be the propyl analog of MXE, that would make sense.


Not that I have any say in things, but bluelight is influential. I strongly recommend vendors to drop the bogus names and sales tactics and stay true to the chemistry:


Phenoxetamine

Eticyclidone

O-PCE

2-Oxo-Eticyclidine

2-Oxo-PCE


are the realistic, instructive ones so far. I think the last two are redundant. No one ever used 3-MeO-2-Oxo-PCE for Methoxetamine and the chemically inclined would "get" O-PCE just as readily as the more explicit abbreviations.


Its not a nickname we're thinking up here, its a generic name we're after. When Leo Sternbach synthesized a new substance that had tranquilizing effects he did so working for Roche so the lab code was R0 6-690. When it was viable it was christened Chlordiazepoxide, the generic name. It was still a mouthful for a little pill so the trade name became Librium. No doctor will prescribe you a R0 6-690 and nobody says, "ew I have stage freight, lets pop a R0 6-690." Its not just nicknames, theres good reason for these names, as they pass from chemists (lab code) to physicians (generic name) and the general public (trade name). It has to do with how peoples brains work, from scientific minds to, well, party people in an advanced state of intoxication. A good name cautions and educxates and thus, unites commercial interest with harm reduction. 


How is O-PCE for a lab code, Eticyclidone for a generic name and Phenoxetamine for a trade name?

I don't like it at all, makes about as little sense as the name methoxetamine ever did. To me phenoxetamine invoke images of methoxetamine with an extra phenyl added. 

it's 2-OXO-PCE or Eticyclidone. O-PCE if you're in a hurry. It's already decided really.


No offense, but your proposal reminds me a bit of nexus_tripper, with his campaign for reassigning the name MXP from 2-MeO-Diphenidine to the hypothetical compound 3-MeO-2-oxo-PCP. Sometimes bad names are decided by vendors, but rarely can we change it. And when the chosen name makes sense, it's impossible.


So, O-PCE is the name the vendors are already using, DCNEK is on it's way out because it's retarded. And eticyclidone is a name, because it was used on a polish site long before it was released as DCNEK. And it makes **a lot** of sense, since it is the ketone analog of Eticyclidine.

Please not so harsh man.


I must say Eticyclidone has its merit cause then you can have Phencyclidone, Rolicyclidone, Tenocyclidone and Propycyclidone.


My intentions are good and I seek harm reduction.

Maybe try to create a new compound and name it? For me, your ramblings just dilute real information we need about this psychoactive. Will try this in a few weeks and report about it. I'm interested to know if this one can be plugged, and how the potency vary this way. How about the duration?

I wont ggive any detailt on dosage as I went on eyeballed doses (dont follow my steps) all I can say is that the IV route is pretty like ketamine in effects, more dissociative than mxe and much more than 3-meo-pcp. very euphoric. Harder to sleep after than 3-meo-pcp for me.

No real surprise there, PCE is considered one of the most stimulating dissociatives? What do you mean by 'more dissociative' ? What are the consequences of that brand of dissociation, because there are quite a few things that can happen from dissociation... anaesthesia, amnesia, cognitive trippiness, sensory trippiness..?

Is this shit anything like MXE? Thats al i wanna knowm3-meo-pcp is shit,too manic and no psychedelia...Ive been reading and people are saying this is just chloro nor kwetamine which was doing th rounds a couple years back and that stuff was shit,they said it was going to be the new ketamine,nothing like it,just slight dissociation,nothing else,apart from dysphoria.


I really am hoping this O-PCE is the next MXE.

Well MXE and 3-meo-pcp are like funcional dissos for me, like stimulants with a touch of diss. This one behaves IV like ketamine, you go thru black and white spaces it goes down then foward, then you go past walls, like a K-hole.

You might be confused with NEK? That is N-ethyl deschloro norketamine which indeed was considered a fail..


I for one am pleased to see dissos that are actually very K-like, because while I appreciate MXE and find 3-MeO-PCP and 3-MeO-PCE nice and hardcore at medium doses and just absolutely glorious at lower doses, I don't think I liked where it was going with diphenidine tho I cannot speak for MXP or the fair sounding ephenidine (or best sounding iso)..


Looking forward to trip reports and plain confirmations or disagreements with these comparisons (with K).

Last night I did it again, and again I have no real dose here, but the trip is always the same, a very short hole if you IV it. And smoking a little dmt afterwards was really nice, tho I could breakthrou but I had really cool visuals and almost fell asleep in the sofa.

Pretty much all arylcyclohexylamines (Ketamine, MXE, 3-MeO-PCP etc.) are SRIs, somewhat safe to assume that it won't be any different here.

O-PCE aka Eticyclidone aka 2-Oxo-PCE


I finaly got my sample today, I have been really wanting to do an assay because New Year's is coming and I know people are holding it - and there's almost no good information about this drug. Hopefully my assay will help party people make better choices with their Eticyclidone.


T=16:20


O:00h -- I took 10mg Eticyclidone in 1.5ml warm water, it dissolved fast and clean, and rectal dosed it by needleless syringe.


Methoxetamine takes about 10 minutes to mostly manifest via this route, it takes Eticyclidone 15 minutes with an alert 2 minutes in.


The effect is more anesthetic/"stoning" than MXE, it feels like a warm cloak is put on me, my skin is a bit tingly, itsd very much in my eyes and my visual perception is significantly wobbly. It is more "drunk" and more "heavy" than an equipotent dose of Methoxetamine. I expected something more manic but first imression is that its more of an anesthetic than MXE. Mind is calm, solemn, not particularly euphoric, contemplative.


This is not a party drug. This is a sit on your ass or lie down drug. New year people, do this drug at the destination where you are gonna crash. Impairment is considerable.


I rectal dosed 10mg and I would equate this to 20-30mg MXE rectally dosed. I am taken in a clearly different way than I would be with MXE though.


So far its a good drug for me. I'm 45 minutes in. Its more stoning than manic to use the lingo.


THIS IS NOT METHOXETAMINE.

THIS IS METHOXETAMINE'S BIG BROTHER.


It appears a heavier drug than MXE and Eticyclidone sounds right for it. It chemically and experientally is inbetween MXE and PCE. The 3-MeO group of MXE indeed appears to be a mitigating factor compared to O-PCE


I will proceed with caution.


At +1 hour the effects had remarkably diminished, seeming more akin to 10mg MXE rectal, so I decided to plunge another 10mg. The effects were fuller, as is to be expected. Its still heavier on the body, but not in a bad way. At this point, so far, this seems a good drug. I don't know what future hours bring but this might be MXE successor people have been hoping for. I feel as good as I want to, clarity is fair, a bit heavy feeling in the head. Potent stuff. No lie, watch OUT with this cause it seems more "stoning" than MXE. I'm excited AND sedated. At hour two I feel confident to try a 20mg plunge.

At hour two I feel confident to try a 20mg plunge.


4:30h Oh wow. what can I say, what can I say about what happened to me. I had a fullblown Entheogenic experience of great significance. I'm still piecing myself together. What I did at the 2 hour point was prepare 20mg Eticylidone in 1ml water, which rapidly and completely dissolved and administered it rectally. This, for lack of better words, blew my mind. No really, I was blasted to smittereens. This was full on intensity. I like to do methoxetamine sessions where I take 30mg MXE every hour and go on for 24 hours with no sleep. 700mg in 30s every hour rectally. Thats not pussyfooting around. This 20mg Eticyclidone atop those two 10s topped that. This stuff is up there with PCP.


I had to completely relearn how to use my brain and body. It obliterated my shortterm memory, it was like I was completely rebooted.


This sounds frightening but I am not afraid, It was all good. In the intensity of it I physically and spiritually connected with the spirit of the drug. It was all loving and powerful and told me its plans for the world. It told me that it had very important things to teach to many people, that that was its purpose here, now. We interacted through all my senses for what seemed an eternity.


It was completely epic.


Please understand, this is not a casual drug. This is a BIG DRUG like DMT or PCP. This is not coddly cosy Methoxetamine, Eticylidone (and it likes to be called Eticyclidone) is a "harder drug" so to say. Dont use this casually cause it can turn your universe inside out.


It was all good, it was perfectly good. But it was a hundred megatons of good, capiche?


My body wasnt quite comfortable. I had a tendency to feeling nauseous in a chemical sort of way and there was a bit of a headache through parts of it. Doesn't really matter though, small price to pay. It might have been psychosomatic.


I quit boosting. No more for me. Not because it was bad or that I feel bad in any way, I'm filled to the brim on this grand total of 40mg. My plan, based on methoxetamine experience, was to sorta boost through the night but no, the train stops here.


Wow this is good stuff. In the intensity of it everything took on a green tinge.


I have bit off the maximum amount I can comfortably chew. 40mg, wow.


Guys, if you are into hardcore dissociatives, this is it.


Eticyclidone is the new Angel Dust.

Thanks for the report, Asante ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) Sounds like great stuff, although maybe not the MXE replacement people were hoping for, since it sounds quite hardcore.

After coming down for 4 hours I decided to start taking 10mg rectal doses again to see if the enormous effect was an anomaly, and ended up doing this all through the night until 10AM, when I decided to quit because I estimate the cumulative effects to last for the remainder of this (second) day. It was difficult at times but epic. Still is, at 1:30 PM.


I tried one rectal 20mg dose again but its too high a dose for me. 10mg Eticyclidone rectally is more powerful and longer lasting than 30mg MXE rectal. I estimate I used a total of 120-150mg of the stuff.


It does stir the bowels and bladder, but not as much as MXE.


Rectally, Eticyclidone is quite a hard dissociative.

I have a question for you then good sir. like most people I've had a long love history with MXE, but intranasal has always been my preferred ROA for some reason. I couldn't ever seem to get it right, which is bizarre because I am no stranger to rectal n foadministration..... used to do 50mg rectal MDPV at the worst(or best of depending on... yeah you can probably guess of times) and those were bizarre, but rectal administration of disassociatives seems to just completely knock me out cold from start to finish. Titrated dosages, played with it for years, it's strange. Just makes me black right out within 5 minutes... would a 5 mg solution be a decent place to start? I would like to find a way to make this last as long as possible, and maybe i'll finally be able to figure out how to not just completely anesthetize myself from a single bit. I haven't tried dissolving it in water yet, but I have clean 10% alcohol on hand.


but anyways... This compound. Wow. Even intranasal, 25mgs of this stuff is BEASTLY! unchained, manic, peripheral schizoid akin to PCP moreso than MXE. Have yet to go any deeper than that first trial, but will likely today. 


The way I typed it out to a friend of mine who is looking for something MXE like and wanted to know what it was like, I typed out to him at the time "TUE 7:48pm 25mg of the Open cereal box is just god damn fun

every single thing is there but stronger

I willl enjoy trying to stand up in a few moments, but I'm not gonna try yet. Those kids don't know shit if they're chasing a leprechaun around, Lucky Charms are the least of their worries, Tony the Tiger wants some FUCKING MEAT BRO

Whatever the fuck he is. He is indeed a tiger. I can't crawl in there right now into his den, I had to shuffle around some stuff that didn't get here yet. but I can see it from here now . god damn he set himself up pretty nice to yeah

it's a thing. it's real. hole probabably manic

Tue 11:26pm

This is a very big angry thing. Warm and coxy mexican maybe but yeah, unhinged tactile, memory and mania. Fucking beastly.  shizophrenic grade delusion. not MXE."


I know that's cryptic, I had to use social media to contact him unfortunately since my phone last died... but it is all reference specifcally to O-PCE (Open Cereal Box? c'mon. that's funny) I had some issues pop up mid experience that I had to deal with so I wasn't able to take it any closer to a hole/crawl into Tony's Den. but if you can make any sense out of that, this is essentially an unhinged, quick blast of MXE-ish magic, that goes away and leaves a big pile of manic goo. Anyone with issues with psychosis needs to STAY THE FUCK AWAY. This is NOT a therapeutic compound in the sense of 3-meo-pcp or MXE's "It was so beautiful I could cry" magic. It's the Holy fucking shit, things are moving around even though I know they're stationary objects. 


Particularly fun is watching a LED TV screen move for inches and inches around a dark room backsplash. Also particularly noteworthy was what seemed like a thin, almost soap-bubblish veneer sheen of film clinging to mid air and maneoverable with interaction. This happening around 5 hours after injestion without redose after a single 25mg intranasal administration. 


Sorry if that's a clusterfuck to read, but yeah. This one is indeed some form of Angel Dust moreso than an MXE replacement. Schizo-typical symptoms continued throughout the 5-8 hour point, hearing conversations through the wall that wasn't happenening, investigating noises that maybe were a whole lot more important that what they should have been, mild confusion and lack of desire to interact with others or the cats... took a quarter bar of Xanax and a strong drink to sleep at the 7 hour mark. This is a personal response and issue with dopaminergics i'm familiar with, but this one was much more of a problem than MXE or 3-meo-PCP ever was. To be Continued. In short, it is not the medicine I was looking for, but wow is it ever an experience worth keeping on hand for psychedelic value alone. If I can source some better quality 3-meo-PCP hBr again, that would be my preference to this compound.


Also to be noted, I have not yet had anything even close to the sort of bladder issues I was getting from high purity MXE. Best stuff I ever had was so potent that the first dose of that period turned urine almost brown in colour. this caused no discolouration or smell. likely because I don't have to do the full 200mg to get to where I want to go of course, but I shall return with many tales.

50mg rectal MDPV, holy crap you must have had a stim tolerance. I was once given MDPV instead of MDAI and I daftly ingested 300mg orally after an allnighter featuring 500mg 6-APB. A wild ambulance ride (I had a heart attack years previous), pissing myself repeatedly while holding my fathers and stepmothers hands saying my final goodbyes as the heart monitor wailed, ravingly psychotic, fear of inhuman intensity. I can confidently say the worst fear of my life is behind me.  But, I did find Jesus in the process and stopped my worrisome use of Empathogens so hey, its all good.


If Dissociatives knock you out cold rectally, kind sir, might it be a hint to reduce your dosages? :D Rectal dissociatives are best bumped repeatedly in moderate doses rather than taken in big doses.

Does anyone know if this would be lipophilic like 3-MeO-PCP? I believe I read somewhere the closed ring on PCP is what makes it lipophilic.

indeed my friend. A 100mg dose once put me into a state of complete carphologia for about 2 hours... look that shit up. it was FUCKED. receded into big beautiful trails akin to real LSD-25 hallucinations with marijuana after it subsided. it was bizzarre. Dark time in my life for sure.


and Yeah, I have tried that before. even as little as 5-15mg of MXE would make me just wake up the next day like... well, that wasn't very much fun. I ususally drink well-mixed alcohol before and during my experiments with these things, being an alcoholic and all... Not hard liquor, but 10% beer, 8% mixed drinks... I believe that's usually why I just get blacked out. I could intranasal up to 200+mg of MXE while I had my tolerances up though... so it never made much sense. I'd like to find a place for this one to keep tucked away for those people who show up thinking they know a thing or two haha.

Guys, and I'm talking directly to the guys with the lab coats now: I would really like to see Rolicyclidone. You know what I mean, make it, spread it. It would be like falling headfirst into a Hole without hitting the ground ![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif)

No dice, its an Ethyl and a Keto. In my experience its eagerness to dissolve in water was up there with methylone, the stuff practically completely dissolved onsquirting the ml of water onto it. Super water soluble. If I were disaster prepping for emergency DIY needle anesthesia this would be dirty but good choice. Like its 2-thienyl cousin Tiletamine its very anesthetic, it knocks you out. This is one you could do surgery on, it just lasts very long hich is whyt they chose tiletamine and not its phenyl cousin eticyclidone.


Really lab guys, Rolicyclidone is where the magic is at. dooo eeet. I'd buy a gram without sampling it first. Super Holey stuff.

I'm very intrigued and plan on trying it soon. Ephenidine in my opinion was the most hardcore of any dissociative I've tried but as harsh as it felt on my body I would not research it again. 


You mentioned nausea and headaches, possibly psychosomatic, so how light does it feel on the body compared to MXE? I don't want to use K often with the bladder issues and DXE feels a bit rough when used multiple days in a row. So it would be nice to find something at least close to MXE, the increased potency is very appealing.

PCE is known to cause more nausea than PCP, according to wikipedia that is. I personally would get nausea from both MXE and ketamine from times to time, not with 3-MeO-PCE though. That was superlight on the body.

I havn't been this excited about a chemical for a good while, probably since I found 3-MeO-PCP years back. I love my dissociatives. This is the next chemical i'm going to purchase for shizzle.

Hi fellow psychonauts,


This really is a warning for you all.It isn`t the first time that i`ve been in hospital because of drugs,but this is the second because of arylcyclohexamines,which i believe this compouns must be.


The day after boxing day i opened up my gram and used my old 50mg scoop,i proceeded to dump three lots into 5ml of warm water in a cup,i used to be a real hard head with MXE and thought i could easily do this,this was the biggest mistake of my life,at first after getting into bed naked and plugging the solution i didn`t feel much,then everything went completely sideways.Much groaning and moaning animal noises were coming from my room,the police were called along with the ambulance,they found me in a heap on the floor,naked next to my bed,blood everywhere after i must have bashed my head,i was contorted and in a state of rigidity with fitting intermitently...I was in such a state the authorities had to close the road off,the fire brigade were called as they needed one of the hard plastic rescue stretchers to put me on,i was completely unconcious.


By the time they got me to the ambulance my breathing stopped and heart stopped too,tubes were inserted and artifical breathing was administered.This beast works very differently to MXE,it doesn`t interact very well with other compounds like diazepam and buprenorphine which i take regularly and it certainly doesn`t like big doses.


I came to in hospital in critical care unit with a pastor reading me the lords prayer,which the ressusurtation team joined in doing,i was dying man,everything was failing.The drips must have started flushing me out and the drug must have started to wear off,or the Lord decided not to take me yet.


As i started to get a grip on things everything sounded very tinny and mechanical,everything was robotified,people spoke in layers,so three people in a room sounded like many,many more.The medical staff were fantastic and did the best they could,i cannot praise them enough,also the all the services involved,i am very grateful for what they did and am so sorry i had to put them through this nightmare,im sorry to my family too,even if they don`t understand,i don`t understand,i just do.


As i started to come back it was horriffic and humurous at the same time,it was sick and twisted in its hallucinations and completely mad,this is what i believe PCP must be like,i went through hell and stayed in hospital for five days? i came home yesterday anyway.They also gave me a shot of naloxone which as the O-PCE wore off i was thrown into withdawals,once i told them i was on a program they sorted out my meds again.


So PLEASE,THOSE WHO THINK THIS IS A MXE REPLACEMENT,IT IS NOT,I WOULD SAY MORE A PCP REPLACEMENT.Be so very very careful,i didn`t think and died,im lucky that i am here writing this,i dont want anyone else to experience what i went through.


May God be with you all.

Get a milligram scale and don't do "150mg" of a potent substance for your first time, regardless of tolerance.


Did you even read the thread? Most people here take like 10-25mg...

^^ I've done proper angel dust, dipped smoked and snorted. Only a handful of times granted but enough to know 3-MeO-PCP and actual PCP are quite different effects-wise in subtle ways.


I very much doubt that this is a PCP-esque drug though.


Still... cannot wait for this. Ill be all over this thread when I start researching this.

Thanks for the advice ROI but i was a bit pissed at the time,oh and had been abusing benzos,which doesn`t help,especially this time of year,but hey shit happens and this was the Shit.


Ive also had 3-meo-pcp and can say this is nothing like 3-meo-pcp at all.I suppose because you are all taking small doses or correct doses? Who knows it doesn`t come with a dosage chart lol,then this substance can manifest itself in many ways.I took about 4 grams orally of MXE when it happened last,but this was way more fucked up than that...Now you think about that,4 grams of MXE is a whopping dose in one shot,this makes that look sweet.


Im just saying be responsible,not like me,the only thing im doing responsible now is trying to stop others from making the same mistake.

Phoenix_Rising, I deeply feel for your misfortune and hope you will recover soon. I regret that my trip report of December 30 came too late for you. If I had gotten my sample I would have tested before. This is exactly the kind of thing I wanted to prevent. My God you went into cardiac arrest?


Plugging 20mg was in ways more potent than plugging 60mg MXE for me. Its so strong plugged.


And 4gr MXE orally? You probably puked most of that out and it saved you.

Stop being Bluelight's LD50 guinea pig. PETA does not approve of your testing ethics.


PLease get well and embrace life because subconsciously I think you either are suicidally reckless or have a deathwish.


Happy New Year. So glad you made it *hugs you*

Thanks Asante and Happy new year to you too ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png).I am trying my best to get psychiatric help because i have been doing drugs recreationally for many years,but since i had a string of misfortune and too much drug abuse i seem to be getting worse,in my eyes my future is hopeless,thats why i need help.


And alfredosause,no not bullshit,please read posts properly before commenting...I ended up in hospital and had to be resuscitated after the 4g of oral MXE,i didn`t puke it out but had a flush in the hospital,that was bad enough,but this was much darker...Much,much more powerful.


I survived 4g MXE,but there is no way in hell i would survive even 1 1/2 gram of this beast,no way!


So plese be very careful.

Okay just to follow up,if you can get the dosage right with this product then it is a exceptional to say the least.If you avoid drink and benzos and get your dose right then you will not end up in the state that i was in.


In my opinion i like this better than MXE,but much more powerful,these are the early days,stay safe and play safe guys.


(Ive just looked back on this and realised,if your mindset is right and you feel good,you can say any old shit when high...Hindsight is a wonderful thing lol.

Phoenix, it sounds like you do need help, but remember, you have to choose for yourself that life is worth living and that you want to live. I've been in the same place as you, acting recklessly, etc. etc. and it always comes down to if you truly say yes to living, or no.

He didn't took 150mg neither. He took 3 spoon of "50mg", but the scoop could have been of 25 or 75mg depend of the density of the product powder.

Are there any CEVs when in dark room on 2-Oxo-PCE? If yes can someone  describe how they look, like MXE CEVs? or more like complex, full 3D DXM  CEVs?


Also anyone know what max dosage orally would be pretty  safe? 50mg? more or less? (i know to start with lower doses but in  future they won't be enough probably and i don't want to go over safe  maximum ![:p](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png))

Ok this is odd.When i was in hospital they asked what i took,so i tried to explain...An analogue of an alalogue etc etc. What i was sold stated that it was this new 2-oxo-PCE,i had no doubt to disbelieve as the vendor has always been very professional in their practice,but having said all that i got my bloods today and it says i had in my system Ketamine like substance,cocaine,benzodiazepines and opiates.


Now i can say that i am prescribed benzos and bupe but do not take cocaine or opiates,1 because cocaine quality and purity where i am is shit and the price is way too dear and 2 i dont take opiates because im already on Buprenorphine which blocks nearly all other opiates,so either the hiospital haven`t a clue,which wouldn`t surprise me as the spelt cocaine as "coccaine" any way,or my vendor is getting desperate and making up his own shit,or being sold shit thats being made up? Who knows man? Who fuckin knows????


I just really don`t know about this one guys,i cant even communicate with the vendor as they are closed for the holidays.


The consistancy of the powder is like 3-meo-pcp,it`s fluffy and sticks like mad,when you take a close look at it,it`s more like needles than grain.Why cant they just admit that the war on drugs is hopless and that too many people are getting fucked on the way and legalise all the shit and have it regulated and done in a way that protects the users? It`s all about the money and fuck the rest,these are strange days we live in,in the future we will either fall into extremely wicked ways or we shall become more enlightened and act like the humans we are supposed to be.

> Ok this is odd.When i was in hospital they asked what i took,so i tried to explain...An analogue of an alalogue etc etc. What i was sold stated that it was this new 2-oxo-PCE,i had no doubt to disbelieve as the vendor has always been very professional in their practice,but having said all that i got my bloods today and it says i had in my system Ketamine like substance,cocaine,benzodiazepines and opiates.

Your are on bupre, so you're positive on opiate, no big deal here. O-PCE made you positive on ketamine like substances, no problem too like for benzodiazepines. The only thing that is strange is for the positive test on cocaine if you didn't take any for 1 week before the test. Did you take a stimulant 1-2 week before the test?

It sounds like I received from the same vendor, based on the vacation. 


"The stuff is active at 5 mg intranasally; highly manic, wobbly vision. Alcohol combined at the 8 hour mark produced immediate and intense vomiting accompanied by manic behavior."


I was observing a girlfriend who gave me that report. She has had copious amounts of experience with mxe, 3-meo-pcp, 4-meo-pcp (her second favorite), the xx-phenidines (MXP being her preferred as diphenidine is too compulsive). 


Be careful. Tripsitters are a nessecity on this one.


PR: I hope you get help; you are acting as if you have a deathwish. Please be careful!

Even the smallest "panel" will have bupe separate from opiates... (here at least) so yeah, very strange indeed... 


Shit's gettin' all fucked with RC market recently(ish), my "Ephenidine" from what was at the time a "reliable vendor", now known more as "selective scammers" ![:sus:](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/suspicious.gif), apparantly (i say this as the test was not done in front of me) came back positive for amphetaminyyytypish...notsosure stuff... further testing was positive for (extremely high purity) "Methamphetamine" ... ![:?](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/confused.gif)


so yeah, be careful all y'all dissoss lovers out there (basically Ket heads who don't want trouble with the law LOL) 


Damn "**Pheonix rising**" i feel for you and your familly... Over a couple of days but i've been over the 4g's of MXE sublingualled, not in one go.... renal failure, artificial coma, 8 days in hospital tubed up.... so yeah i feel for you, got a lump in my throat now... and your family) i like to think there's a reason i'm still here, some good i can bring after all the pain and suffering those who love(d) me have gone through... ![:|](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eyesclosed.gif)


My intranet dude's have got 94% purity o-PCE, please PM  me if any of you have sampled this particular batch, so i know a little more than i do now.... (also take high  dose benzos and bupe atm... so yeah... thanks to anyone who can provide some  (solid) info... thanks)

You can go very far on this one. It would depend on what a hole means to you. High doses of this are not advisable, its a hard dissociative, more like PCE than like K.

Be carefull when using this substance. Not sure why but after few days of using it multiple times (20-35mg doses) my body is acting very strange. My skin in lot of places (left hand <- most serious problem here, a bit on face, on my back, one of legs) is very dry, looks old and has red shade . Those red places are very sensitive to warm water :/ idk what is going on, any help? (i wasn't using anything else in last time, just 2-Oxo-PCE and i never ever had in my life problem with skin like this)

I used this 3 days in a row. First day total of 15 mg through 5mg doses. Second day 45 mg through a 15 then a 10 then a 10. Third day 60 mg through 15mg doses. I haven't seen any skin issues... yet? Neither has the girlfriend that tried it. Intranasally for all doses except the first dose being oral.


I notice the baseline comes rather than an after glow like with mxe or 3/4-meo-pcp. I took 125mcg of 1p-lsd on the second day. It was by far the most fun day. I found that by itself it's been rather lackluster compared to diphenidine or 4-meo-pcp.

I did have cocaine,but i think it may have been longer than a week before,it was actually crack so i would have thought it come out of my system quicker,it was quite a bit though,about £100 worth in a day.


So yeah maybe this is good O-PCE,very good in fact,but just my fault in that i had been reckless and used many drugs in a short period and the alcohol topped it off.


This definitely has a dark side and pushes hard,the afterglow though for me was very good much like Ket and MXE,i also cleared some blockages in my psychological and spiritual state,i actually got to the end of a difficult trip and everything lifted and i felt at one with myself,a feeling i havent had for a long time,almost like coming home when you hit the eye of a storm and you are at peace.


Just stay very safe and weigh your doses,please,please be careful.

Very little pain when used intranasally. About the same as 3-meo-pcp. I did use 2c-e nasally frequently when I was younger; 4-meo-pcp recently... so take the pain idea with a grain of salt. 


The main effect I'm getting is speedy. I do have a very high diss tolerance. It's possible I am missing out on some of the NMDA action or that my medications  cancel out some of the afterglow.

I think people should start with 20mg for testing the right dosage....nearly every post here with 60mg+ had some ambulance related stories to tell.... 

we should emphasize the importance of starting low with this substance.

Man this stuff is litteraly playing with fire. Doses are so small yet 20+mgs can have you going crazy after being done before. Really dangerous stuff


I would start this at 5 milligrams imo.

Yes seriously people, its time to be a little more serious.


My trip report on pages 2 and 3 is still just about the only report in this thread that used proper weighing and did adequate reporting. Not to toot my own horn but to urge people to start seriously assaying this and not taking haphazard doses.


20mg rectal was too much for me, twice, and I'm a fairly hard MXE user.


10-15mg doses rectal were STRONG for me. 


One of us subsequently has flatlined on 150mg, theres ambulances and STILL people take wild doses. Thats not how we do it guys, its not a MXE substitute its a hard dissociative.


Dose carefully. Please. With scales. Write reports. The sooner we get a good profile for this drug, the fewer people will end up on the ER out of their gourd on Eticyclidone.


Don't kill this fine analogue by getting it emergency scheduled. Thank you.

Out of intranasal, sub, oral, and rectal dosing; I would say that oral is the most interesting. 


A quick oral report: 


(8:26am) 40mg weighed on a tray on a milligram scale. Put into a plastic gel cap. 


(9:09am) Starting effects. Left side of my head feels "bigger" than my right. Noticeable visuals. Mainly visual slicing and tunnel vision.


(9:19am) Strong euphoric rush. Similar to I.M. Ketamine. Extreme visual distortion. 


(10:10am) Ability to speak begins. Start blathering on about how good I feel. Slight paranoia. 


(11:30am) Almost full return. A feeling akin to coming out of a Ketamine hole. Left with a speedy feeling, much like the second part of the 3-meo-pcp experience. Where the psychedelic aspects come in. 


(3:09pm) Feels like I am fully back to normal.


Overall I'd say after working my way up the nasal route, I'm happy I did before oral. Rectal was too quick to remember much, I consider it a waste.

Doing cocaine on it's own, depending on the amount, you wouldnt be testing positive a week later. However when you drink and do powder cocaine or crack it forms cocaethanol which has a much longer half-life and will stay in your system for much longer. It's good to know that because many people read that cocaine is undetectable after a few days which is true if you don't have ethanol in the mix. Buprenorphine is an opioid so thats why you tested positive for that. 2-oxo-pce would absolutely give a false positive for ketamine. So I think their test results are accurate.

Yes i agree with you and believe you to be right.


This is an excellent compound when used in doses that are good for the user and that could be drastically different for each and everyone,start small and proceed from there,stay away from alcohol and benzos as these will cloud your judgement and you may end up taking more than you should,like me.


Used in the right manner this compound is pretty close to MXE but has its own personality,i find you dont hole as much,the hole it takes you on is a strange one indeed,there is an amnesic property to it,very much an anaesthetic.

Quiting myself from the start of the thread, had only the pressed 20mg tabs then and founf. 60mg oral dose to be a decent dose then, but far from a heavy one.

Will be getting the powder in a few days from the same vendor as the tabs but pretty sure th powder has been brought in later and isn't what was used back then to make the tabs, so I'll tread the incoming powder with more care, perhaps a 20mg plugged dose, lyijg in bed with headphones like all those magic nights and experiences of MXE. Hoping it will be a sweet ride. Will repport back of course!

It sounds like the pills you got may have been less than advertised, unless you just have a massive dissociative tolerance.  Most reports seem to place this at 2-3 times the potency of MXE so 60mg sounds like an extremely heavy dose.

I have tried this one twice, both times taken orally.....first time was 15mg followed by another 30mg an hour later; second time was 42mg taken all at once. (My dissociative tolerance is pretty high so you may want to cut those doses by half or 1/3rd....normally with MXE I would take around 30-60mg at a time, up to 180mg in a night) I holed both times, but it wasn't a warm fuzzy hole like MXE, it was more clinical and purely dissociating. With the second dose I had pretty strong double vision and trouble walking for a few hours afterwards. I didn't feel like I gained much insight psychologically or spiritually from either dose, and I'm not sure if I'd try it again. Maybe a lower dose would work better for me.

I agree this is not as forgiving as MXE,but it has its own character.In high doses,which i don`t recommend,you do get very heavy hallucinations,very cartoonsih and plastacine like,lots of imagery,internal and external.


I had it to the point where i was completely aneasthetised,dagerously so,but as i started to come to the experience was amazing,amoebas were everywhere,red in colour like little floating dots that covered everything,then i would close my eyes and everything would change,i realised that if i wanted i could easily be frightened to death by some of the visuals,but by laughing at them they would disappear and something more beautiful would appear.


I experienced the net of eyes that one experiences when on DMT or ayahuasca,the net of eyes that cover the surface of everything,the world inbetween worlds.

I didn`t know that deschloroketamine had antibiotic properties,so i haven`t a clue,but why would you want to know? Surely take an antibiotic if thats what you want.


Just read on wiki about the antibiotic properties,interesting,about the only thing that is with that chem,i had almost no response to it at all,i did a gram in an evening and was very disappointed.

Can somebody who tried vaping O-PCE chime in? How does it compare vaped to MXE or Diphenidine? 


If you've tried vaping/smoking O-PCE please provide some feedback on dose, any tolerance you may have and time on first alert to peak, or generally how it compares to insufflation.

phoenix_rising; this is quite a serious problem if you want to use these compounds on a daily basis. If it does contain antibiotic properties, if you use it for more than a week or so, maybe a month your immune system will get used to the compound and stop producing white blood cells. If it gets to that stage it could be on par with AIDs. That's why it's important.


EDIT: Oh and vaping O-PCM works like a dream so I don't see why O-PCE would be different. I'll have the chance to try it in the next few days though so I'll get back to you. EDIT2: In fact I may be getting back to you on that today, within the next few hours (hopefully!).

Hey fellow bluelighters,

5h ago I took 50mg of 2-fa, followed by etizolam at the end. Do you think it would be problematic to try a low dose of O-PCE? My heartbeat ist completely fine and I have enough benzos if something happens.

Problem is I only have today really time for it and since I didn´t take any dissociatives for way more than 6 months I´d liek to try it now.

Hello


So I got some O-PCE today

 It's now 18:30, I'm going to try 5mg intranasal in a few min's. I'll do a trip report.


Anyone have any O-PCE to MXE dose equivalencies and via which route of admin'?


I'm looking for a similar dose to 50mg intranasal/25mg intramuscular MXE?

My plan to write a trip report whilst 'tripping' didn't happen. This compound is strange, it's very good like MXE, but it doesn't feel much like MXE at all.


 It's definitely an empatheogen at low dosage and a powerful one at that!


This trip, and I'll write more later, as I'm gonna bump another 10mg in the next few min's, has felt like a weird GHB-MXE-Opioid experience.


This is definitely gonna be big, just dose low and go slow, it's weird and great so far!

maybe think twice about that 10mg increment increase... stuff is ridiculously potent... (according to, mostly but not only, first hand accounts of an "unsuccessful" first trial....) This is potentially a dangerous one...

The re-dosing isn't the best idea. It seems like this compound gives way to negative side effects relatively quick. The mental effects, in my opinion, turn from euphoria to paranoia rather quickly. It's manageable but not very fun. 


That's just my experience. I've been watching this get used with relatively frequency. I prefer 3-meo-pcp or much more 4-meo-pcp. I like the lack of pain and the dosing amounts (my sweet spot is 40mg orally, or 2 lines of 10 spaced 4 hours apart). Other people seem to prefer lots of smaller doses though.

just new but thought i would chime in,


Im a big fan of K, its rare for me but always the best. I wasnt much of a fan of mxe until a year or so ago when i got into it and ended up loving it. dont find it anywhere near as trippy but its certainly a great aid in the hunt for hilarity of some kind. 4-meo-pcp was nice but pain to dose and i often needed to take large amount. to be fair, the best hole ive ever had was from that from an ill advised 450mg oral dose. Great luckily though. 3-meo-pcp im not so sure about, ive never got a great deal of anything tangible bar either a pleasant feeling or just bland dissociation. i tried 3-meo-pcmo, very almost useless that one. I also tried methoxphenidine which seemed to do almost preciesly nothing even at higher dose.


from all of those, o-pce seems to remind me most of the 4 meo pcp so far. been trying to dose between 15-25mg on 2 diff occasions. It lacks real oomph in the trippy aspect but has a lot more to it i reckon. I suspect oral will be required for trippery purposes.


whats the duration woudl u say? 2-3 hours?

@ blueberries


I dont think this has antibiotic properties as i had a urinary infection and used o-pce during this time,the urine infection didn`t clear and i had to go to the doctor to get a short course of antibiotics to clear it up,which they did very quickly...So no i don`t think so.


I was wondering about the old MXE and thought,would it be possible to put a hydroxyphenyl in the place of the methoxyphenyl in methoxetamine? I`m no chemist,just curious,if that worked it could be called hydroxetamine lol.

Just because it didn't cure your UTI doesn't mean it's not an antibiotic


I don't have a clue whether it is or whether it's not, im just saying that not all antibiotics take care of all infections.....that's why there are many classes of antibiotics that are specific to the bacteria they kill

Yes, there is a patent registering this compound for use as an antibiotic and antiviral at doses of 2mg per day.


I'd suggest being very careful with even semi-regular use until there is some more light shed on this matter.


Edit: Sorry the patent is for the methyl analogue. Still, this is a very small change and I would expect them to closely share properties like this.

Thats methylamino,O-PCE is (ethylamino)


 2-(ethylamino)-2-phenylcyclohexanone to be precise not 2-methylamino-2-phenylcyclohexanone


So i dont think that the link is for the same drug.

Well, even if O-PCE is more antibiotic than O-PCM, the dosage is way under any effective bacteria killing range for substances, even blogbuster drugs like vancomycin or daptomycin have to be applicated i.v.  with 250mg to 500mg and even more. For a penicilline to work you have to take about 2g for 8 days straigt. Don't think 30mg O-PCE once a month or a week should be that big issue

If not taking your word for it and wanting definitive proof that since O-PCM is an antibiotic O-PCE must be too is wasting your time then yea I suppose you are. I hope your time isn't too valuable.

My skin in lot of places (left hand <- most serious problem here, a bit on face, on my back, one of legs) is very dry, looks old and has red shade . Those red places are very sensitive to warm water :/ idk what is going on, any help?

Holy shit, that is very strange. I have been taking 3-meo-pcp for like 2-3 months and I noticed that it has popped up a few places, even has the red things, kinda like lovebite red marks.


Also I must say some of you people are a little crazy, taking that much of an unknown substance. Scales are not expensive.


Might pick some of this up, vendor will be stocking within 1 week, I only have experience with 3-meo-pcp really and that stuff is amazing, how would one compare it to that?

3-meo-pcp is extremely gentle compared to this "beast". Expect the unexpected when you try it. Have a trip sitter. It's more a problem of cognitive suppression. I find my body likes to act on its own, something in the setting is completely allowed but in a city I could see being dangerous. 


Interestingly I have noticed a significant decrease in burn healing (I do work as a cook) but that could be complete coincidence. I have stopped trials as of about a week ago. Overall I love the compound. Subjectively it is super fun, but there are too many unknowns to continue doing it. The anti-biotic effect *possibility* is "scary" until more people have tried it. 


I think the hearing effects are some of the most interesting. Hollow sounds, echos, even musical. It's just... interesting. Much different than most I've tried.

The first and only time I tried '2-O-PCE I weighed 10mg and split that into 5 lines and insufflated them over the course of 1-2h.. that way you can easily get to your desired level without the risk of dosing to high... 

For me 10mg was a light to medium experience intensity-wise. I had no tolerance regarding dissociatives.. '2-O-PCE is really potent.. I think it is almost equipotent to PCE but I have only tried a few low doses (2mg) of this one yet...

it sounds like with the (potential) anti biotic properties of this and dck, a person who can not control their usage to no more than once a week minimum should not partake in these chemicals? Now, perhaps you could say that about all dissasociatives, but I would think it especially true for these, no?

As Transform said in his post, the antibiotic patent was for dosages of 2mg. If it does have antibiotic properties, then I'm not too sure doing 15 times as much weekly is a good idea....

So have the egg heads come up with a definitive answer to the antibiotic question? Does O-PCE have antibiotic properties or not? I think it very important for harm reductions sake to get this information out there,not misinformation or supposition,but factual evidence.

There's no evidence, only speculation. Probably yes, but not a 100% yes.

I'd like to sample this intravenously. What would be a good dose for a breakthrough experience?

Here are my usual IV doses. I have no accute tolerance, but prefer to try dissociatives at 'full spectrum' doses.


NEDPEA/Ephinidin: 300mg

S-Ketamine: 130mg

RS-Ketamine: 180mg

2-MeO-Diphetidine: 250mg

MXE: 110mg


All doses for single IV shots, which I'd like to go for with this new one as well.


Thanks guys ![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif)

If you actually look at the patent for O-PCM. There is no conclusive evidence of anti microbial properties. Just that at high concentrations it killed microbials(as do many chemicals). The patent was filled in case further discovery of Anti biotic properties arose. They did not. 


According to the research done ketamine should portray the same properties. As it has been widely studied and no conclusion can be made, I personally would assume the same fro O-pce/pcm. 


In terms of harm reduction I always stay in the safer side of things. And personally will not use either of the aforementioned chemicals frequently(once a week at most). They seem to mess with my serotonin a lot more than ketamine or ephenidine

I don't think I've read any other IV report, however it seems to be about 3x more potent than MXE, depending on ROA?


You certainly don't want to start with a way too high dose, play it safe.

crOOk. O-PCE is getting close to PCP in strength. If you have to IV, start with a dose similar to the lowest PCP dose you would IV.

My skin in lot of places (left hand <- most serious problem here, a bit on face, on my back, one of legs) is very dry, looks old and has red shade . Those red places are very sensitive to warm water :/ idk what is going on, any help?

In case you should run a fever, your mucous membranes start hurting and blistering you should seek out medical attention and stop taking the respective substance immediately. Are those spots darker in the center?

Lol yeah I will be extra careful. Gonna start with a 20mg IV dose and if that doesn't get me where I want to be I will redose IM in 10-20mg doses. I am a bit of a hardhead when it comes to dissociatives (IV MXE doses north of 100mg without any acute tolerance), so these doses may still seem reckless to some.

Now that is some good information, thank you! Seems the 20mg suggestion isn't that far off. I used to start off with 10mg insufflated (PCP HCl) doses back in the days, but quickly resorted to smoking (god I love that taste) until I was loading my pipe with 100mg at a time. Good times, good times. It will have been 10 years since I last smoked PCP come June.


Would you say it is as hard to hole on it as it is on PCP? I just love the space rs-ketamine, NEDPEA (ephenidine) and even high-dose MXE take me to. I used to hole on PCP in a way, but the state is a lot closer to dreaming in my experience. Still absolutely heavenly.

When I attempted IM, accidently pulled out to soon and some entered the vein. I got a strong rush that didn't really settle down into a hole, I would compare it to my experiences with MXE I.V. but much faster and more in your face. 


The dosage was between 5-12mg. The 12 was measured out but I like to think it's lower. 


Stay safe. Use easy to put away gear. I found it's similar to 2C-E I.V. way that it hits you right in the head. Not much to do (for me) till come down. 


Honestly fun stuff, I can't wait to hear from people using it daily.

I haven't tried PCP. I'm sorry if I made it sound like I'm some kind of expert. My post was based on information gathered from what has been reported so far about O-PCE, and what I know about PCP.


O-PCE seems to be more in league with the more hard core dissociatives, and some reckless people already got their asses kicked treating it as MXE, just going by this thread. I know from your posts, that you know PCP well, and I think it's a good idea to just treat it as you would PCP, for starters - you can't go wrong that way. I thought it was better advice, than trying to compare it to ephenidine and others.

I recently had the opportunity to try 2-oxo-pce.


 ~7.5mg was insufflated, then the same another 15 minutes later to gauge the effects. After another hour, 15mg was insufflated. Only experience thus far. Seems to be a rather lucid dissociative, nothing crazy. Not quite as numbing as 3-MeO-PCP. As always, titrate up, I may have a bit of an NMDA tolerance

Another derivative of the drug that gave angels a bad name.


Pretty full-on stuff actually, much like PCP (never had PCE), much worse motor skill impairment, amnesia, much cozier and fuzzier than PCP or ketamine or any other dissociative I know though. Anaesthetic dose seems to be below 50mg IM. Had to learn the hard way when I passed out and fell to the floor after my second dose, on the way to the bed to which I was then dragged. I dosed IM this time (7.5 + 30 + 25mg), but imagine the IV rush to surpass that of ketamine in intensity since even the 7.5mg came on very quickly. Loud and strong. Time to baseline over 20h for me, if I smoked a joint now it'd be 10 times as strong as usual.


Of the dissociatives I have tried, this seems like it is probably the most abusable one of all (if you don't have a job or family life, but that goes without saying I suppose lol) and hopefully the last one I was eager to try. I told my better half I won't be doing dissociatives anymore and dumped the remaining 740mg into the trash. I've seen all there is to see in this department and my use has become plain self destructive. Well to be fair, I did chill on top of the clouds with my angel homies for a couple of hours. It's still way overdue to turn this habit into a thing of the past, just like I managed to lay off the IV stims in the past year hopefully for good.


Oh and on a sidenote, the main effects lasted 2 hours. Main effects being the time frame before the point at which I decided it'd be a good idea to top the 7.5+25mg with another 30 lol.


No pain at the injection site, very smooth in that respect. Crazy good water solubility, I dissolved it a gram in 20ml, but 5ml or even less than that might have been sufficient.


No nausea for me. I get guaranteed nausea on dissociatives mixed with ethanol, but have never experienced this side effect with any substance from this class taken on it's own.


EDIT: I should also mention that I was running a fever of 39.4 degrees the night prior to the experience (38.5 at the time of consuming the drug) and had taken 600mg Acetylcstein (oral) with the first dose. It binds to NMDA receptors I think, but I don't think that changed anything in terms of effects.


The fever was gone after the experience and I felt a-ok the next day (not manic the way I usually become after PCP use due to my bipolar I disorder. However I attribute this to the Amoxicillin and Clavulate I took the night before, not to the PCP analogue. Thinking 2'-OXE-PCE would have any clinically significant antibiotic properties is bordering on the absurd, especially with the existence of that patent everyone's talking about.

Damn right! If you include ketamine in that list MXE also belongs in it imho. Ephenidine is an absolute monster, too, made K look like a joke to me.


Btw I did listen to your advice and used 7.5mg at first which is right around the lowest PVP IV dose I would ever bother to use, far from a breakthrough for me. The feeling of that initial dose was just *so fucking heavenly * that I didn't get around lifting myself way up into the sky with this one. 


Treat this substance with respect. Newbies should use 5mg oral on their first trial and slowly work their way up imho. Redosing works just fine without (no accute tolerance), but keep in mind that this stuff tends to linger around for quite some time (in my single trial experience and judging by the way structurally similar substances behave), so you might just black out upon redosing. The best advice I can give is to keep any material other than the initial dose at a location that will be impossible to reach for you until after the experience. Same goes for other dissociatives with 'Jeckyl and Hyde' character.

Ok.  i have now tried this at 10mg, 15mg, 25mg, 30mg, 44mg (no redose) and one time doing 2 30mg doses an hour or so apart.  The 30x2 was by far the best, 44mg on its own seemed mild to me. I know its a new chem etc but it was from the 94% batch also and i tried low doses multiple times with so-so results.  im not telling people to do this but i would be tempted to go for regular 40mg with this now ive had a good go with it. Very euphoric for me, not much tripping but fairly strong feeling. Its like half between mxe and 4 meo pcp to me.  I did some drunk stupidly but whilst i was very buckled i still had a good time.  Please note even with low tolerance i always only got on with mxe around 80-100 at the least. 150 was a more common dose for fun   its far better than 3 meo pcp which barely does anything bar mood lift for me even up to 30-40mg.  This stuff CAN get you to that point where u just feel stupid but happy and loving everything and just having a very nice time of it. Ive not experienced any proper trippiness with this yet but ive not tried oral. Ive had mild generic dissociative hallucinations but nothing memorable or particularly stand out. I also had this problem with mxe, i could achieve great results lieing down in bed but whilst stilll operational and doing stuff i got very little trip from mxe, it went from being funny as fuck to that point when u dont know anything anymore and your worried ull get stuck in the lviing room if u dont latch onto that last memory of coheartness as hard as u can and get to bed in one piece.  My advice to anyone? if your a dissociative newb be very careful. even if your someone whos used to small doses of dissociatives then start very low. but i reckon a fair few that like it a bit more substantial will eventually up there dose as 25mg was probably the least i could even take to gain anything in terms of effects i enjoy.

Hey, any report on vaping o-pce?


1 toke of 1mg and titrate up regardless but at the moment not touching this until I get some reports from others who've vaped O-PCE.

Best mention your MXE doses first thing in that post before some poor guy too lazy to read goes and takes 60mg expecting it to not be trippy. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


I for my part was taken to actual dream worlds as I always am on breakthrough doses of dissociatives. The second of two 30mg IM injections (two hours after the first) had me lose all remaining motor function while I was walking, leaving me in a state of complete and utter anaestesia until I came to around 6 hours later. I have dosed 150mg MXE IV before without any adverse effects and 100mg IV used to be my sweet spot. So I am honestly a little puzzled you report 60mg to not be very trippy. 


God this one was good as fuck. Walking past that trash can with another 10 or 15 loaded syringes in it each time I went to the kitchen proved very difficult.

Seems about right, 3-4 times as potent. 200mg MXE IV would have me feel about what 60mg did to me.

So, I took this substance last Friday. I went for 15mg rectally in water. That's a rather low dose, since I naturally need 300mg of Ketamine to get to the hole.


It was a pleasant leaving of the reality. I somehow went into the 4th dimension and enjoyed the observer position. You can compare it to a place in the corner of a room, you can easily observe everything going on. I was functioning very well through out the trip. I exchanged some impression with my friend who dosed as well, smoked a bowl and even went to the toilet.

My imagination went to a whole new level and i could feel me playing the piano music I heard from the laptop. It was a smooth sailing of the inner dimensions. A vacation from the world.

The rough time scheme is as following: the main effect started after 10min, the peak was at 30-45min and the main dissociation ended 1,5h after ingestion. The afterglow lasted till the 5 hour mark.

I noticed a strong analgesic effect as well, as an anti depressive effect on par with my good old Ketamine.


This is all based on a single trip with this substance at a low dose but I will definitely do it again.

I suspect this to be amazing for depression, judging by how I've felt the last couple of days. I am bipolar and used to get aggressive and manic back when I used PCP daily. PCP doesn't inhibit motor function and memory as badly as this one though, at least not if my memory serves me correctly. Might be apparent even at low doses. The 7.5mg already did that to me, eventhough I felt like walking on clouds, almost MDMA-like in that respect. Crazy euphoric!!

On the bladder effects; you might not want to jump to this from 3-meo-pcp. I have only 2/3rds of my pancreas left so I am more susceptible to urinary retention. 


With O-PCE I feel relatively large amounts of retention. Akin to Ketamine. 3-meo-pcp doesn't do this to me, unless used for long periods. Others have reported minor effects in this range. 


I worked my way up on finding a dose since I had started using this before the thread was started. I found the low doses do work well as a compliment to my anti-depression medications. I just see more damage than good with using this one on low, daily dosages. 


I suggest pulling up the "O-PCM manic" thread that was recently posted. It's a slightly different chem but I could see similar building effects as well.

Not dissapointed in the least, there's already a fair amount to be learned from that single report of yours. Most important is that you're OK after that blackout. 


Apparently this one is going to be a very tricky beast to tame, especially for those who are usually prone to compulsive redosing...

Yesterday i tried ~ 15mg nasally (ca. 20:00 european time) and i have to admit: this compound is strange...but also heavy indeed and a very dissociative one , too.  After application of those 15mg the oncoming rush was very familiar, but also slow, maybe oral ROA is as effective as well, anyhow it didn't progressed like MXE or MXM. The high was reached within 30 or 40 minutes and lasted 2-3 hours for sure. It is not calming and sedating, more stimulant and dissociative engrossery to a distant place. You're headspace keeps clean and maybe even objective, but you are losing somehow control over it. I took a shower, not knowing if the water is cold or hot, i had to trust my experience in regulating the temperature with the position of the shower leverage. I could  have even been boiling/scaling my skin without noticing, luckily my experience was well constructured, so afterwards (i mean by now) my skin is not damaged. After showering i went to bed, because movement impairing is heavy on this one, i had to lay down or experience unpleasant nausea, so you also want to make sure you have a location for spending the trip horizontally. I also recognized optics, colours were more vivid and geometric proportions of my surroundings were stretched and shortend, wobbling in my mind but not in reality, i could for sure differentiate that. At some point it reminded me of a Saliva trip i had about 5 years ago, it removed me remarkably from my well known reality. It leads me to a place, where personality does not really make an influence on your observation, you get your information and impressions from the reality and maybe get to interpret a human perspective on those things later.


 After the peak, i was still laying around, moving is a huge issue and connected with much effort, it does really feel anaesthetic, but i couldn't sleep either, so i was just following my thoughts and looked to what dark place they lead me, one for another. I finally fell asleep at 4:00pm after watching tons of senseless youtube videos, but i really enjoyed them as well.


 Now it is T+ 15h, i still feel a little bit disorientated and also definitely lacks a good amount of sleep, therefore a little bit shattered after this strange experience. I thought i had a low dissociative tolerance, but somehow this proves me wrong, so please be careful with this substance, it is really potent. I also have to mention I was on St. Johns wort for about one week, my trip felt highly serotonergic like the first DXM experiences, measured on side effects like nausea, headache and orthostatic dysregulations ( i felt low blood pressured like on a bottle of wine)  therefore i conclude this compound is also very serotonergic, but i have to try this after a few days off St. Johns wort to verify this theory. 


I will report back in a few weeks when i have the time to gather more information on this

Be careful, folks!

St. Johns wort is an inducer of the CYP3A4, which is one of the major enzymes involved in the biotransformation of ketamine (So most likely in the metabolism 2-Oxo-PCE as well). 

I would guess, then, that after a week on said plant you would actually feel decreased effects from Etycyclidone. Keep in mind next time you dose !


EDIT: Well, now that I think about it, if your ROA was insufflation then mabe the CYP3A4 doesn't play much of a role given that parenteral administration is supposed to bypass the first pass metabolism in the liver ? Please someone correct me if I'm wrong.

Yes, but the elimination is also enhanced, so the peak may be decreased, but the enzyme inducing effect normally takes about 2 weeks to appear (from what i learned at my university). But St. Johns also seems to up-regulate 5-HT3-receptors and inhibit mono-amin-reuptake-transporters, therefore the anti-depressant effect. But i still feel afterglow effects by now, i learned through the hole day and cleaned half of the apartment. Feels like a well antidepressant boost similar to the afterglow effects from DXM. I always thought this comes from it's SSRI ability, seems like Eticyclidone is able to perform that, too. I am a little bit scared of it's effectiveness, my mind is still in a mildly way shattered, but as the day goes on, i feel more restabilized.  

Truly interesting substance, but truly have to be taken with respect and awareness...

Wow, I've had this exact same trip coming out of my body on MXE... Never heard of a similar trip before. It's one of my favorite experiences. Except I was going around my room taping on objects to make music from the TV play.


My body laying on the bed said to keep going, and the out of body version of me didn't want to show off. I said okayyyy, but this is gonna sound out of this world. And it did.

Well i was not getting a frightening fear, it is more a overwhelming state of "woah, what was this?" maybe i should try it again when i'm in a time of comfort and relaxing, not like yesterday evening with a little bit of haste and st. johns wort in my blood with toppings of oncoming tiredness...... set and setting, next time both will be better

Thanks, but I was aiming for a real low dosage. 10mg of 3-meo-PCP is a high dose for me. Also I never took anti-biotics in my entire life.


So, sorry for a repitition. What would be really low dosage (the plateau where cannot differentiate between placebo and drug-induced effects) for a disso-naive person (last low-dose disso-intake was 8 months ago).

I would like to chime in after having repeated research of this particular Chem. I really think that this is where "they" should be looking into,this chem is a gem,it really is. 


After getting the wrong dosing and fucking up in a big way I learnt that it needs ro be respected. Once this is achieved then you can really find the positive healing qualities that it has,in my opinion O-PCE out weighs and beats all other psychedelics in this field of research. Once one can handle the beast then you have a drug that is literally life changing,it seems to get to the root of problems and cleans away the detritus that has built up over the years,once you lay down control of the drug and open up to it,it is then that miracles happen.


I don't like to sound fantastical or over the top with this but rather just post my findings as they are,I must add though that I added 2-fluoro-ketamine to the the mix and belive that this has very good synergistic effects,the 2-fluoro on its own doesn't shine as much as when mixed together.


When experimenting I journey inward and use CBT and Shamanic practices. I really can then get to the root causes to psychological,emotional and spiritual issues,it has been an immense tool at dealing with these,much more powerful than the DMT's which everyone seems to be getting side tracked with,not only that but the arylcyclohexamimines are much better to work with in more ways than one,they do what all the others do any way and some more,also you do not have the legal restraints as much as they are in a different bracket.


So for the wider community I would suggest to start looking more into these than them as you will get further in more ways than one.


The powers that be have known about these tools for years but have had them locked up in a cookie jar because they know of their potential. But now,once again pandoras box has been opened and there is no stopping it now. 


Psychedelic mushrooms and ayahuasca preparations have been used for yonks as a way of getting around the situation,but now you have much more convenient ways,not only convenient to but much more rewarding.


The alchemical mix used is like two to three parts 2-fluoro and one part O-PCE,it takes some practice so be very careful,always make sure someone is around and knows what your doing. Otherwise it's a trip to hospital or the grave. 


I genuinely am trying to help myself as much as others for I see we are all the same any way,doing good good is better than being bad. It is a simple truth.


I have yet to try this with addiction issues,I believe firstly that you have to repair the damage before you can fix the problem,so this is what I am doing.


I have used many medicines and allies from nature to try and help for many years and have only now come full circle and realised the dream of what it is,so for me by using this mix of arylcyclohexamines I have literally found myself again and been baptised once more.


You could read this and just think this is delusional ramblings but I jest you not. This is much more powerful than iboga or ayahuasca or even mushrooms,these are the tools of the future for the mind and soul.

O PCE is in the US, look harder. A few places I think.


Tried a 1mg allergy dose last night.


Waited about 3 hours and mixed 30mg with 3ml water. Dissolved instantly and easily.


Dosed 5mg. Then another 5mg ~2.5 hours later. Mostly just read a book, besides the first 30 minutes or so where I meditated.


It kinda seemed more like the come on of a fullpsychedelic than a disso. Like there was the potenial for something huge to come. Seemed kind of visual. Was easy for me to have pretty vivid (for me) mental imageing of the very detailed fantasy scenesI was reading about. (Robert Jordan's "Wheel of Time" series).


Both 5mg dosez were rectal. Main effects seemed to peak about 2 hours in. Do not have too much more to add with my smallish doses


I am naturally hardheadef and have a dissociative tolerance to boot. If you do not, 5mg should be plenty for an inotial dose, of not 5, then perhaps 10.

I have used 3-meo-pcp (10 intranasal) and o-PCE(40 intranasal in two dosings) back to back. It has heart issues. My average bpm is 55-65 and this combo had my heart at about 95-115. I take measurements during, or have someone assist me with it. Also, bladder issues arose from the combo. 


I have a high tolerance and a lot of experience. I also know how to "dance in the void" as one would say, so don't take my dosing as the correct one. 


Good to hear you've had such luck Phoenix_Rising. I personally don't see that potential here. I see more recreation than deep use. I see a comparable detachment between them but beyond that they change my moods too much to feel like the progress isn't just emotional building rather than actual progress. I tried both bout 3-4 years back. I am more psyched to start trying out 3-meo-PCE or 3-meo-pcmo, instead.

Tried another line of 2-oxo-pce at 32mg, not sure where the term "heavy" is coming from. Reminds me a bit of MXE but not as numbing. Though I should say, **I do have a bit of a tolerance.** Usual MXE lines start around 80-85mg and 3-MeO-PCP 20-25mg


I find it very lucid(mentally) and not as mongy as MXE or 3-MeO-PCP

I know we don't do vendor discussion here, but you're in the US, right? I'm assuming that you're not getting it from the same source, as the rest of us in this thread.


Are you sure of the purity, of your O-PCE? It's important, because if your product isn't pure, it could cause some people to dose wrong.

I'd split that into two lines, done 15 minutes apart and it get me at that perfectly relaxed, warm dissociation. Where I'm too fucked to safely drive for an hour or two, but not so fucked up I can't have conversations, follow a movie, or browse the forum.  That's my dose to do and hang out with my fiancé after a hard week of work. 


I'd say 32mg of O-PCE was equivalent to ~60-65mg of MXE, for me. 


O-PCE is probably my next favorite disso behind MXE now. For me:


MXE>O-PCE>3-MeO-PCP= DCK=Ketamine


Only reason ket isn't that great to me is it's short duration. I love to be able to do one line and chill for a few hours. O-PCE is very good for this, definitely less mental distortion than MXE at the doses I've tried thus far

Its funny, in some ways you sound just like me.

i def share your thoughts that dissios have a very real potential that may equal that of the classic entheogens.


However i do need to point out that these kind of drugs also have a huge potential for serious addiction!


Ive been fighting to keep my use under control since i first found mxe when it came out.

Ive never had a serious issue where i was doing it daily or anything, however in the last years there havent been many months passed where i didnt touch any kind of dissio (i prefer ketamine and n20 since they feel benign in moderation although ive tried dxm and most rc dissios that has been aviable since mxe)


However my opinion is that all the long lasting dissios are toxic and not worth it.

They all leave a nasty chemical feeling crash afterwards, it takes several days for the body and mind to reset.

With ketamine (and the new 2-fket) you come back to baseline faster and they actually feel god for you in moderate doses.


Ive seen my share of delusional ayahuasca hippies sure, but they probably think im crazy for shooting ketamine and evolving in my way.

However i think the ultimate solution is to try different medicines and find different parts of the great mystery.


I try to take at least a few heavy doses of plant medicines every year, shrooms, cacti or aya usually.

Then i do some kambo every few months aswell, i feel this keeps me grounded so i can play around a bit with lsd and n20 or space travel with ketamine sometimes.


I notice that if i stray to far away from the plants and only ingest chems i get very robotic and less empathic, but if i only do plants i get to out there and spaced out.

The perfect formula is not yet out there, but im working n what works for me %)

I noticed a very steep dose/response curve for this chemical. I increased my dose from 15mg to 18mg and got way deeper into the 4th dimension this induces in me. Next time I'll try 20mg but I don't think that I'll go higher than that. I have somewhat of a tolerance since im heavy and need higher doses to take off. A friend of mine noticed the same when he went from 10mg to 15mg and doesn't want to go much higher, or only in steps of 1mg. He has no tolerance and normal weight.

Theres also an increased duration for the main part of the dissociation with increased dosage. It goes up to 2h for the doses we tried.

Is this stuff more profound than 3-MeO-PCP? I liked MXE, but 3-MeO I couldn't ever reach where I wanted to be, it just didn't have the euphoria. If I chased the euphoria I was looking for I'd end up blackout/retarded. The price of O-PCE keeps me away, but if it is like MXE at lower dosages..hmm..

Took this a bit a higher last night. Previous dose was 32mg, went up to 40mg and the dose response curve seems pretty steep. 32mg was a nice mild dissociation, with mild numbing and a slight euphoric touch. 


40mg..... Well.... Hahah. Very strong dissociation, stronger numbing but still not as strong as say 20mg 3-MeO-PCP. Very euphoric, a lot of laughing with my fiancé. Could still talk but there a little confusion here and there. Music was amazing, listening to some blues was really deep. My mind never really left me though, much less confusing and more lucid than an equipotent dose of MXE or 3-MeO-PCP, more lucid but not exactly clear-headed. Definitely got that touch of psychedelia that's been mentioned.  


By far my new favorite dissos, right up there with MXE for me. But it doesn't have that feeling of flying through space and the amazing CEV dreamscapes MXE gives when I go to sleep, still amazing nonetheless. 


Please be aware that these are very high doses and my doses seem to around double of those without any tolerance. Dose accordingly.

Havent gone higher than 10mg in a single dose so far. I really like it. Seems more lucid than 3 meo pcp, and probably mxe. Nice mood lift and euphoria. Doses 10mg and less still leave me basically able to pass for sober and be around people and go out and do shit.


Will probably try to push for a "hole" dose soon and see  how that goes.


So far oral seems about as potent and quick to come on as rectal. Main effects 1-2 hrs, diminish for another 2-3 hrs. I sniffed 5mg and it seemed more speedy. Pretty much the same as 3 meo pcp and mxe.


I think it will combone quite well with psychedelics. Especially for solo tripping/going deep. Closer tk mxe than 3 meo pcp in that regard. Will put it to the test soon

I am accustomed to dissociatives and reach an M-hole at ~60mg IM and a K-hole with s-ket at ~140mg IM.


00:00 +1 mg PO - nothing

02:50 +4 mg PO - nothing, maybe a little sleepy


00:00 +7 mg PO - nothing, maybe a little sleepy

06:43 +3.5 mg INH - nothing

09:30 +7 mg INH - nothing

10:24 +9 mg INH - nothing, maybe a little nausea

13:42 +15 mg IM - within 10 minutes some upper chest tightness, neck feels warm, still no dissociation at 60 minutes


00:00 +24 mg IM - first effects 5m, some dissoc 8m, tightness at 12m, heavy feeling & blurred vision 15m, vocalization difficulties at 18m, sleepy at 30m, turning towards baseline at 45m, too impaired to drive at 90m, fairly clear-headed at 120m


00:00 +31 mg IM - first effects 5 min, some dissoc 8m, warmth at 10m, tightness at 15m, neck tightness and flushing 20m, BP quite elevated 20m, hot at 25m, very hot 30m, very high BP sensory, very hot in the chest at 40m, still not much dissoc, significant health concern of elevated BP.


This will end my experiences with this compound.


note: my primary concern with titrating this substance is the possibility of Stevens-Johnson Syndrome or similar. ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stevens–Johnson_syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stevens%E2%80%93Johnson_syndrome))

I had 22mg sublingual last friday and my trip went 3 hours pretty intense and after all the after effects were lasting up to 16 hours. Don't think IM is the way to go, even nasal is not anything better than my sublingual trip. Only vaping is a form on it's own, it's intense and short, but nothing you can really work with. IMHO

The Steve-Johnson Syndrome is a T-Cell mediated overreaction on some drugs and causes necrosis of skin and mucosa. It is not directly linked to an antibiotic effect, despite some antibiotics can cause a Steve-Johnson Syndrome. For example some NSAR or Allopurinol can induce it.

I did relatively heavy testing when I had tried it and I found no reaction. Dosages of 60+ over 24 hour periods for three day trials. I feel as if something T-cell related would have popped up when I had a blood draw shortly after.

can anyone comment on the energy level you feel while on this one? for me, i find MXE to be fairly energetic, ketamine to be more sedating but still some energy there, and then deschloroketamine (2-oxo-pcm) is pretty sedating and i just want to sit around. i'm wondering where 2-oxo-pce compares.

Energy level is lifted. But health concerns leave it sedating, in a body load-type way. Want to get up and move around but discouraged by signs and symptoms of high blood pressure. Stevens-Johnson is of concern due to previous commenters' signs and symtoms.


SMG, what T-cell related test do you think may have been relevant? What test did you do?

Really liking this one.


Massive user of Mxe when it was about and used it in varying degrees functionally on a day to day basis and a lot deeper when I had the opportunity.

Not pushed this past the 10mg mark but build up on several 10mg doses over the course of the night.

Really nice, like Mxe you never really know what you’re going to get i.e. sometimes very stimulating other times sedating.


None the less really warm and has those Mxe moments where you’re thinking just seems to all click into place and ‘you get it’ type thing.

On the flip side of that couple of confusing stages last night where my brain felt a bit mongy but I’d had a couple of drinks some benzo’s towards the end of the evening.

Also goes great with weed and a couple of beers.


Feel great today after last night’s experiment but slightly detached emotionally for some reason.

Anyway very functional at lose doses which is great for those of us that need to fly under the radar.

I'm used to sticking to smaller forums, but I thought i'd add my 2cents:

[/FONT][FONT=Calibri, sans-serif]**Setting:**[/FONT][FONT=Calibri, sans-serif]My bedroom, Night, Everyone else has gone to bed.


[/FONT][FONT=Calibri, sans-serif]**MindSet: **[/FONT][FONT=Calibri, sans-serif]Excited,i've been looking forward to a new dissociative to hit the marketsince the MXE ban, and I managed to get a 30mg free sample of thisfrom a reputable vendor.


[/FONT][FONT=Calibri, sans-serif]**Pre-Trip

**[/FONT][FONT=Calibri, sans-serif]It'sabout 23:00 and after finishing work, eating and doing some choresi'm finally ready to give this promising new dissociative a go! I'vegot a fair amount of experience with Ketamine, MXE and 3-Meo-Pcp viaa variety of ROA's but held back from ordering any of the most recentdissociatives which hit the market (namely the diphenidine family)cause I didn't hear many good things about any one of (infact, mostof the reports seemed to be pretty negative!).


Since Ketaminehas been varying a lot in quality and price in the UK, andMethoxetamine was banned in the EU last year I've been waiting foranother decent quality dissociative to hit the market. When I heardthe first few reports of O-PCE I was definitely excited, but at theprices it's currently selling at I couldn't warrant the cash toactually buy a decent amount, luckily my a reputable vendor sent me a30mg sample. Although I new it was meant to be potent, I can't say Iwas expecting to feel much from 30mg!)


I'd been up all theprevious night after having a couple of doses of speed the nightbefore, so was quite tired. This may be why it hit me sohard.


[/FONT][FONT=Calibri, sans-serif]**T+0:00**[/FONT][FONT=Calibri, sans-serif]– I read a few reports saying to start at a dose of around 5-10mgon BL, but I stick to smaller forums and a member I trust thererecommended at least 20-30mg, so I weighed out a line of about 15mg.I contemplated doing an allergy test since this stuff is so new...but couldn't wait. I snorted the line.


[/FONT][FONT=Calibri, sans-serif]**T+0:02**[/FONT][FONT=Calibri, sans-serif]– I already feel it coming on, there was little to no burn andmaybe a tiny bitter taste. The effects of Mxe usually build up over30mins or for me from the nasal route, but this was much quicker andreminded me more of Ketamine.


[/FONT][FONT=Calibri, sans-serif]**T+1:30**[/FONT][FONT=Calibri, sans-serif]– I've spent the last couple of hours in a Ketamine like daze,browsing the web but not doing much imparticular. I didn't listen tomusic but have a feel this would definitely enhance it! To mysurprise this 15mg line felt like the equivalent of a line of around80-100mg Ketamine (with no tolerance).


[/FONT][FONT=Calibri, sans-serif]**T+2:00**[/FONT][FONT=Calibri, sans-serif]– I'm still feeling the effects, but the have died down enough forme to feel fairly normal. One of the main reasons I do dissociativesis for the 'holing' aspect. I hate having to snort vast amounts ofanything, and I only had another 15mg of this stuff left, so afterreading varying reports (from the little info I could find!) oninjecting this stuff and also reading something about another drug inthe same family having somhe weird anti-bacterial effect (I didn'treally understand what they were writing about but it didn't soundgood), I decided to prepare a shot with what was left in mybaggie.


[/FONT][FONT=Calibri, sans-serif]**T+2:05**[/FONT][FONT=Calibri, sans-serif]– I wrote a little note saying what I had taken, which ROA anddosage beside my bed incase worst came to worst (but I was fairlyconfident at this dosage range, and having had experience with otherketamine/pcp analogues that i'd be safe). Then proceeded to givemyself apx. 15Mg IM injection.


[/FONT][FONT=Calibri, sans-serif]**T+2:15**[/FONT][FONT=Calibri, sans-serif]– I put on some tribal chanting type music and with a slide show upon youtube and laid in my bed, not expecting much more of an effectthan that which I had from snorting, and then noticed myselfteetering on the edge of a 'hole'. I don't think I full holed, but Iwas surprised at how close I got with such a littleamount!


[/FONT][FONT=Calibri, sans-serif]**T+3:30ish**[/FONT][FONT=Calibri, sans-serif]– I come round enough to know I'm definitely safe and reallyenjoyed the near-hole experience. It was more colourful and evenslightly euphoric compared to and MXE hole (which is what i'd beenmost used to as of late). I take a couple of Diclazepam, which Iusually find useless for sleep, but like I said I had no sleep thenight before, so drifted off fairly quickly and without much trouble.The 'hole' effects seemed to last a fair amount longer than Ketamine,which is what I was looking for when holing with MXE, but theresidual effects seem a lot shorter than MXE in terms if difficultysleeping! So it will be very interesting to further explore it onthat front!


Overall I was surprised at how much enjoyment Imanaged to get from only 30mg of this stuff, and I woke up feelingnice and refreshed the next day. A few other reports say 2-5mg dosesare quite manageable, so there's hopefully there's potential withthis for occasional anti-depressant use (which I used to use lowdoses of mxe for). 


Though as it's so potent I'd see a lot ofpotential for it to get very messy in the wrong hands or wrongenvironment. (Just imagining some of the idiots who use Ketamineirresponsibly, or as a dance drug getting their hands on this makesme face-palm so hard!)[/FONT]

I finally tried 2-Oxo-PCE. I started with 10mg plugged (after 5 weeks off of ~20mg/4 times per week MXE usage for many months), then dosed three 5mg doses over three hours.  My limited initial impression is that it's a mostly successful MXE replacement (I don't mean to imply inferiority or superiority by "mostly"). It's interesting that our collective reference frame for judging it largely reflects (I think) a break in dissociative usage patterns. That is, I imagine most people are reporting on the effects of 2-Oxo-PCE after an involuntary tolerance break from MXE (though they may have been using 3-MeO-PCP and company in the interim). We can't really imagine what sort of splash this chemical might have made had it and MXE exchanged places in the history of drug culture.

Start with 25-35mg. This might be underwhelming, but getting a feel for a new disso when one comes out is a must. That being said, 25mg is a pretty common, moderate dose. Just don't start any higher. It is everything that ~90mg IV MXE is. (And this is coming from a former big-time MXE enthusiast.)

I completely with the last bit. The data that I found showed a break from all dissociatives for over 6 months, so no tolerance whatsoever, and the first, meager trial was sparkling, glimmering, promising. Although not with plain, blind enthusiasm. Seems like this one's a winner, barring the possible antibiotic properties.

This is a wondrous analogue that has me flying through fourth dimensional art galleries made of cotton candy. All is soft, warm and cozy with rolling bouts of laughter and the occasional tsunami of euphoria. I've blended it with MDMA and mushrooms and will soon be attempting a break through dose of DMT. It should come as no surprise that cannabis is an absolute perfect pairing as well. I will say I experienced a near unquenchable thirst and went through over a liter of water. My highest dose to date is roughly 20mg and felt that got me very near a hole (is it an O hole then?). Titrating up to 32mg next week. Having tried only MXP, 3meoPCP and ephenidine prior I'd have to say O-PCE trumps them without breaking a sweat. My word of caution is get a milligram scale and titrate up. Have fun and be safe.

My experience with O-PCE thus far has been mixed. This stuff is straight fire, like electricity. Pairing it amongst the other drugs in this class, all of them have their merits, but I'm having a hard time finding the right applications for this one as it is a beast that has yet to be tamed. It does reveal a more personal relationship to electricity. Literally it is like electricity, enhancing all sorts of electromagnetic energy senses. The come up is warm and remisniscent of MXE, a nice sheen of blanketing energy, but the tail is very long, many hours inebriatiting to the point of almost being annoying and wanting the energy to go away so that the mind can get back to its baseline current of patterns. But it does get to the heart of matter, and for that I am grateful of its message. Has anyone IV'd O-PCE yet? I want to give it a try to see it it can kill the demons left inside of me, speaking of its antibiotic properties.

Glad you enjoyed it so much. I've only tried it twice, both times at about 40mg, and I found it to be mostly dissociating but with no emotional warmth like I'd get from MXE. However I'd been taking 3-MeO-PCP almost daily at the time, so that may have interfered with it. Not sure if I'll be trying it again.

I was able to get these effects from it when I stepped up my dose, so maybe individual mileage varies. While still possessing a lowered dissociative tolerance from my five weeks off of MXE and the first trial noted above with O-PCE, I recently plugged 25mg to start and added two 10mg boosters over a few hours for a total of 45mg. I managed to achieve effects akin to those described in my thread [Sensations of highly dynamic motion/flight with coordinated visuals?](https://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads/719553-Sensations-of-highly-dynamic-motion-flight-with-coordinated-visuals-on-dissociatives) 


As far as I'm concerned, O-PCE is a "full spectrum" dissociative along the lines of MXE and ketamine. If I were to place it with other dissociatives I've used between the dissociative effect poles of anesthesia/sedation and mania/heady stimulation respectively it would fall in line like so: nitrous, ketamine, O-PCE, MXE, 3-Meo-PCP, 3-ho-PCP, DXM*, Ephenidine, Methoxphenidine, Memantine*


I strongly suspect it's the anesthetic effects that are responsible for what we call "holing". That is, I believe the brain is being tricked into thinking it's sleeping and paralyzed (not embodied) and that's where we get most of the fun stuff from. 


*these guys are sort of hard to situate along this dimension because of heavy SRI side effects and D2 agonism respectively, but oh well.

yes, what is the consensus on this topic ? 

i think it is very important to learn whats the deal with this. 


the chemical is very nice, i personally like it very much after my first few trials.

 I tried it 3-4 times and would love to try it again but the possible antibiotic properties scare me. especially because i like it very much and fear that i might tend to use it 3-4 times a month... **please if some one knows something for sure - *let us know!* **


also i found a paradox with this chemical and would like to know if anyone else has found this to be true - nasal administration is stronger for me than I.V.

i tried it 3 times I.V. with ok results - there was a rush but it wasn't strong as with mxe or ketamine but more like the 3meopcp rush. So i decided to try my last amount nasally, because i decided the so-so rush was not worth the hassle and also because i was curious to see how was the trip when taken like this. And the effects were much stronger for the same amount by injection. 

I split it in two lines in spaced 1-2 hours apart. It was actually so strong that i even got the robowalk which almost never happens to me with dissociatives anymore. Also the duration was a few hours longer which is a good thing too.


For people that have tried oral, sublingual and nasal - which ROA did you like the most ?

i recently tested 15mg sublingual and had a few hours of fun with it. next weekend i will test 15mg oral and see if this ROA through the liver somehow intensifies the trip. it is possible indeed, lets wait for results.

but also i remember that mxe was oral also nearly equally active as nasal, so by far we can't say that much.

But to the contrary just because you "feel" like it didn't have an antibiotic effect in a month and 2 grams isn't any kind of scientific evidence that it isnt

^^^ Sorry, but your data point proves nothing. I have no idea whether or not it posesses antibiotic properties, but just because you didn't notice any ill effects, even with mega dosages, doesn't mean anything at all wrt to this valid concern.


> what antibiotic in the world can you take 33.3x the dose for 30 days and have no ill effects


Do you have some specific knowledge of this experiment or are you just imaginging? It's only very recently that the serious problems associated with needless (and even needed) antibiotic use have been accepted at all. The negative effects from antibiotic use can be very subtle and long-term indeed.

Ok, so it clearly has antibiotic effects because the people who made the patent said it does with zero proof and a clear reason for saying it has effects. What does it matter? If having antibiotic effects makes zero difference, then what does it matter if it does or doesn't other than random interest.

You said you didn't notice any negative effects after like, what, a few weeks? Lots of negative effects may not be noticed for decades. Long-term gut health problems have only become recognized after many years of going mostly unnoticed by the medical community.


Anyway, as I've said, I have no idea about the true danger, but I think it's ridiculous that people take these chemicals (any of them, even forgetting about this one in particular) and preach that they are safe. They are an unknown quantity. They may be benign and they may have long term consequences for your health. No one knows. Saying that you felt fine after taking some doses is irrelevant for the discussion of long-term consequences. We are all taking a real risk (myself included). Some of us are simply in denial.

In the patent are just some positive effects on viral/protozoic infections mentioned. And i really doubt the antibiotic properties come through at that low doses. As i said in an earlier post, even the most potent antibiotic drug has to be taken at doses around 200-300mg more than once a day for many days. I don't see this substance is that big breakthrough in solving the problem of lacking of antibiotic therapy options today. 


But another interesting occurence i notice by now: I feel somehow smarter, my writing and my speech got better and i also felt nootropic effects like those from noopept. I firstly thought it was just an illusion or some wrong interpreted connotation. Maybe it still is. Can't say more about that in the moment. I took it 3-4 times in the last 3 weeks (~10-15mg). But about the antibiotic rumour i have to say: O-PCE is either a game changing antibiotic or simply this attribute doesn't matter in the dosage of our needs. If anyone is planning to do this up to 150mg and more a day ( and i clearly do not recommend this!), we can take on with the discussion of antibiotic properties. Otherwise further proofs are needed, everything else is speculation about rumours and a lot of hot air ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Antibiotics are targetted at bacteria, hence their pseudonym antibacterials. Just thought I'd mention that. I didn't read the patent and still think it's absolutely absurd to think this substance has any type of antibiotic properties at recreational doses. The entire pharma industry would be all over this, since existing antibiotics require much larger doses. Absurd. Can't believe this is getting so much attention here.

That's what most glutamatergic dissociatives do, once we comedown we have a high chance of becoming manic or at least more creative, gaining more enjoyment from our usual activities, be they cognitive or physical. I often have a focus on spiritual ideas in that state. However, trust me when I say this won't last lol. If you browse bluelight for threads on dissociatives you'll always find people convinced they just found the holy grail of therapeutical psychopharmaceuticals, but then eventually we see them end up roaming the streets naked fighting off dozens of heavily armed police officers. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png) 


It's a state I've managed to reproduce plenty of times in order to find relief from acute depressive states (bipolar I diagnosis), but if these drugs are taken daily life will quickly turn into a pile of shit. That's just my experience. On a sidenote, I find PCP a hundred times more effective than racemic ketamine (the s isomer not being worth shit in this respect - not to me anyway) when it comes to treating depression, but studies on mice seem to disagree on  this one.


This was definitely one of my all-time favorite dissociatives btw, having vast experience with PCP, Ketamine, and whichever new ones the internet throws at us - via all ROAs, but mostly smoked/IM/IV.

That's what i'm saying. It clearly is absurd. Not absurd is an antiviral component, but it isn't called antibiotic then, hence to the fact that science doesn't see a virus as living organism, it is more some kind of intelligent materia, an organic compound. Other antiviral substances like Zanamivir are used in doses around 10mg, so this is more an option. Since it is a small molecule with the ability to have a positive charge it can maybe for example block the M2-protein in the viral uncoating process.  But nearly any other drug has this ability, too. We really need to stop thinking about it :D


For the nootropic state afterwards i do not really think this substance should be taken on a daily base. Many other dissociatives make people feel likely to forget things and make them feel stupid after long episodes of taking them. I also felt "thinking highs" on MXE, but that was always during the peak. And somehow MXE and MXM made me feel stupid afterwards. O-PCE makes me feel a little bit more productive and enthusiastic at least for one or two days. While MK-801 is used in science to protect cells with NMDA-channels from dying the glutamat-induced apoptosis and therefore is actually neuroprotective,  i think O-PCE has similiar properties if it doesn't destroy cells on other mechanisms. 


But i also recognize some irritation of the urinary tract, think this should also be mentionend, though.

this stuff is no joke I took a tiny amount 4 hours ago and less than 10m after I 100% forgotten about my subutex withdrawal 3mg a day for 2 hours was borderline hole and maniac at the same time. 

Psychosis molecule. 

Does it have some potential at higher dosages ? I sadly heard u quickly feel bad with dosage increasing

This is what made me revaluate my use recently. 2nd time I tried this I got really uncomfortable bladder feelings. Super hard to piss first three hours. Like a pressure on my bladder, then a slight burning when I finally could piss. 


A few days later I experienced the same to a lesser extent with 3 meo pcp. Never had that happen with 3 meo pcp. Had some mxe and ket a few days after that, and didnt really notice anything out of the norm.


Started to freak out thinking I have now fucked myself with dissos. Starting reading up on UT/bladder issues. Startedto remember I have had trouble pissing sometimes for over 15 years. Remember gong to doctors convinced I had a UTI or clamidhyia or something and all the test came back negative. Remember some nights being up for hours unable to piss knoeing I had to terribly.


Realized I have developed a few tricks over the years to where this usually doesnt bother me. Mostly it seems to have to due with relaxation and not forcing. Like leaning over the toilet braced against the wall, or just sitting down and runming hot water.


Feel like fucking Hank Hill with a narrow urethra. I remember one doctor saying "mild prostatis" whih basically means "your fucked". Gotta figure this out because this is bullshit.

Hm, an urethra irritation is a few steps away from "you're fucked" , but it is the first step into the direction. I will now make a break for a month from now on. 3 Days after the mentioned irritation occured, it is becoming significantly better. Obviously this should prevent people from taking it every day. Like every drug some negative side effects should be there, but if taken seldom and have a healthy nutrition, much to drink and perform some sports from day to day even Eticyclidone can be a substance to live with. I have stopped drinking alcohol and stopped smoking cannabis, don't know if i traded those against a bigger evil or not, time will tell.

Someone had asked earlier about a combination with 3-meo-pcp. I in no way advocate this behavior.


Anyway... here is a quick report


So took 5mg 3-meo-pcp nasally, then 5mg 3-meo-pcp sublingually. 


+1h I am feeling pretty happy. Got a ride to grab my Eticyclidone. Take a measured (+/-5) 12mg's sublingually. Ride takes me to a bar. 


+2h [Heartrate of 89-93bpm | SpO2 97%]

The confusion starts and rambling about a trip to Puerto Rico and LSD vs ALD-52. Numbness engulfed my body. People comment on my grinning. 


+2:30h Being shuffled around from bar to restaurant is pretty fun. I keep seeing flashing lights in coordination with the music of the live band.


+6h (about 3am) Get obsessed with eating, go to a burrito place and I remember feeling like that scene in "Requiem for a Dream" when they are getting food. I have the scene play out in my mind of the powder on the paper then the eye dilates. I fall asleep in the car on the way back and wake up in my bed.


Overall the combo is actually really enjoyable. I prefer it mixed with the ALD-52 over 3-meo-pcp.

I myself enjoyed the combo also, but I went a bit crazier than you.


I took 10mg orally of 3-MeO-PCP, followed by 15mg of o-PCE three hours after. They sinergized pretty well, I had a 3-MeO-PCP manic experience until I took the o-PCE, what turned the trip into something more relaxed and psychedelic, nearly holing. 


A few hours later I added 20mg of 4-AcO-DET, and I had one of my wilder tryptamine trips. A lot of shaking and tremors (nothing uncomfortable, though) and nice eye-candy.


I don't encourage anyone without experience with tryptamines and dissos to do this, though. Keep in mind I was a long time everyday ketamine & MXE user, and my tolerance is pretty high. A combo like this could easily scare the fuck out of a newbie.

trademark disso behavioral and emotional response.. did not take me anywhere deep, was clean headed, usual dehydration and no sleep.

not quite magical but worth a lot more then the likes of ephinidine, mxm etc

Does anyone know if this substance has any active metabolites? I binged on half a gram of this a few days ago and I can still feel it now. I feel dissociated and dizzy as well as extremely lethargic. I can't stop sleeping.


Is there any way to encourage it to get out of my system sooner?

How can you binge on that stuff? 25 mg oral for me is so long (Like 6-8h of experience) and intense (mixed with cannabis and without a lot of tolerance, I for sure hole easily!) that I have got not desire to redose. This is a beast, and should be treated with more respect than MXE in my opinion!

I have an insanely high tolerance to dissociative drugs. In all honesty I blacked out for most of the period I had stuff (poly drug use). It's a mistake I won't be making again. It's far from a pleasant experience.

IME you'll feel the after effects for up to a week. Everytime I dose o-PCE or 3-MeO-PCP I can feel them on my system usually the whole week. I feel you about the high tolerance, though. I myself was a daily MXE and ketamine user, I can snort half a gram of K and don't feel a shit. But with 3-MeO-PCP and o-PCE I need to at least spare doses between 2-3 days, or I'll just feel like shit for weeks, and would have wasted a lot of precious arylcyclohexylamines on the road (And o-PCE is not as cheap as MXE for even considering binging on it!).


Again, with the intensity and duration of those compounds I can only see redosing output as a nightmare. If tolerance is the problem, just go up with your dose, but redose with those ones isn't really wise!

Good point there guys. Tbh my lack of judgement in this is rare but definitely not something I will repeat.

I definitely need to dose higher otherwise it ravages my body for way too long. I can deal with a day or two of suffering. (We all must pay a price for hedonism?

I went clubbing last night on it (Plus 2 tabs of good LSD). I found it easy to bump and I was social. Going about 10mg lines each time out of a little vial. 


The visuals and ability to move, but with "k feel". It's cheaper than k in my area, so there is no question on choice until some negative effect shows up. 


I actually found the holding my bladder kind of useful. I could feel strain but not bad. This morning there is very minor pain.


(I'm not a normal club kid, those days are behind me. It was one hell of a time though)

How is snorting compared to oral in effects? Also, it's easily snortable like MXE or does it burn/hurts?


My raver days also finished some years ago, but you reminded me I had a fucking awesome time mosh-piting to live ska high on 15mg o-PCE, weed and beer a few weeks ago. I haven't got such a good time since so many years! ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


About the bladder negative effects, I also find hard to pee on this one compared to 3-MeO-PCP (I find it easy on that one) but not at all annoying. It was worse with K or MXE

I saw someone else call it "psychedelic cocaine". I think that's an apt comparison for the nasal dosing. It reminds me more of pepper than a burn. Just a sneeze reaction that's hard to catch. 


I am enjoying these few new RC's to hit the market. I wasn't into others as first but this, ALD-52, 1P and 3-meo-pce seem to be winners.

I gave it a go last week for the first time, didn't much care for it. Used about 50mg over the course of the night (oral and rectal ROA), it's lucid at the low doses like people say and doesn't seem particularly euphoric. I got a splitting headache about halfway through the experience that lasted for like 3 days and I feel really turned off by it now. Especially considering it just didn't seem particularly "good" in any regard.


For me: MXE>ketamine>ephenidine>3-MeO-PCP>DXM>deschloroketamine>diphenidine>O-PCE


I guess one trial isn't enough to thoroughly judge a compound, but it speaks for how thoroughly unimpressed I was by the experience. My friend who was with me has some dissociative tolerance (though not as much as me) plugged 20mg in one go and holed for 2 hours, he came out of it scared shitless and said he would never try it again. I'm looking forward to trying 3-MeO-PCE, but thus far I'm convinced nothing will come remotely close to MXE for my purposes.

I almost feel like there is a split between the classic diss' and the new ones. 


These newer ones are specific to what you are looking for. Some drop you in holes (MXE, D/Ephenidine). Some are essentiallly new types of stimulants (O-PCE). Some are more euphoriants (3-meo-pce). Some are something new.... I still don't know what it is but I feel like the experiences of Iboga and MXP are similar. (*Wild speculation is the 5HT3 changes* but that doesn't mean anything)


It's like they dissected MXE and Ketamine and said these are the type of things people are chasing and separated them. Just a random thought.

Strange that so many of you consider this one stimulant. I consider it relaxing, really dissociative and easy to hole. 3-MeO-PCP is stimulant. This one is just long-lived.


I consider this one the dissociative part of MXE, while 3-MeO-PCP would be the stimulating one. A combo of both in correct dosages is insanely blissful, and I prefer it over MXE for sure!

Just after posting I thought about yourself and told myself: "Maybe this people are snorting it like StMorningGlory, who talked about psychedelic cocaine?"


I just use oral now. I know that the snorting route ends with daily use and heavy binges, at least with me, and the effects are usually more stimulating. Since China made me withdraw from MXE, I enjoy my oral doses of PCP analogues more than any common experience I would have with MXE, and my nose is clean as a whistle!!!


But I'll for sure try the snorted route the next time I party! But maybe with 3-MeO-PCP first, as it's already perfect orally for going out and socializing. I loved so much my oral o-PCE+cannabis&beer-holes (Like the first holes of ketamine or MXE that I don't have anymore since two years because of tolerance!) that I don't want them to end!


But for sure I'll try, the psychonaut that lives on me is asking for experimentation ^^

I felt really speedy the one time I snorted this. Oral and plugged both seem really sedating. Much more so than 3 meo pcp.

Couldn't resist after reading all this, and snorted 15 mg of o-PCE an hour ago. So far like a low dose of oral o-PCE plus amphetamine. I prefer it oral, but I see the potencial for parties and raves on snorting ^^


I would say potency of snorting is half than oral route, maybe. 15mg snorted really feel like 5mg oral or so.

Yes, it really is. I tried sublingual and was yet suprised, that potency and time till the first effects were somehow equally. And I was even more suprised, as I just ate it. First effects after 25min and really strong effects. That's the reason for my first experience with it, which was very intense. I thought i can lick the zip-bag out after putting the whole substance in a glass with cap. ~ 10-15mg oral more on top of my 15mg nasal should not do that much, i thought. Well, i was wrong :D

I consumed 2 doses of 5mg "2'oxo-pce" via nasal ROA everyday for the past 3 days. The title of "psychedelic cocaine" kind of matches my experience. I felt mood lifted, had a kind of lucid headspace but was still focused and felt socialized. I noticed a slight opioid activity with this one, which was drastically boosted by some codeine.I started with 5mg each day and redosed like 2-4 hours later, which lengthened my current state and kind of pushed the dissociation further. I have not tried more than 10mg a day yet and I am wondering if I will dose any higher in the near futuer. I did not notice any bad side effects yet, but I will stop my testing at this point as I am worried about bladder issues and that antibiotic story going around. I am going to advise everyone to NOT use this on a daily basis right now, and keep in mind that this one is very potent. I felt slight motor impairment at only 5mg! Play it safe.


Regards,


UA

I myself didn't enjoyed snorted route really. This one is a beast I'll keep tamed, and will only let it go wild with my mind orally those days I want to chase the paralel universes or when I feel I need to search the meaning of life.


3-MeO-PCP as refresher of the soul, orally, once a week. 2-oxo-PCE once monthly for knowing myself better, and digg into the core of the whole existence. I love 2016. Rest in peace, 3-MeO-2-oxo-PCE,  I won't forget you... But I've got two girlfriends now, and they are better than you for my life

I truly believe that the nasal route is just a fast onset and a glimpse of the effect. When I tried it orally, I would say MSK has a better description regularly. I come from an area where a gram of Eticyclidone and Ketamine are equally priced. If I'm going out to a club,  I feel the choice is obvious because of a price/hit ratio. Also the not having ketamine covering my nasal passage (we have shards here) is a huge bonus. Like I said those days are mainly behind me but I still have friends that go out and I could see this being thier D.O.C. instead. 


That is also because they, as well as myself are looking for weaker effect in that setting. The oral dose, in my opinion, is better reserved for at my cabin when I can howl like a wolf because I saw the "moon twitch". (True story, it was pretty funny) I feel that the loss of mxe was big but to me, it was a nessecity. MXE had more spectrum potentials. Eticyclidone and the xx-Phenidines are much focused in what they try to achieve. MXE is like the college dean, each of these "babies" (3-meo-pcp/pce, 4-meo-pcp, eticyclidone, desclK or however you spell it... ect) are just teachers or friends. 


Eticyclidone is like the guy who is really shallow at parties and super fun, but when it's just you and him stepping out for a smoke break, he tells you that your life is a lie and reveals all these secrets about you. Someone not to spend too much time with but enjoy it while it lasts. 


I hope that didn't become confusing, but it seems as we are explorers in such new realms that we are able to give an

anthropomorphic viewpoint applied to help speak of what the variations there are.

I feel you, trying to explain the feeling of this drug with words is just imposible, and we're doomed to try to do it with subjective analogies and poetic shit that for sure is only true and valid for ourselves ^^ Amazing mind-bending, life-changing stuff.


I'm also with you on that MXE feels like beeing the all-things-in of dissociatives, the full stack, and those new ones beeing like little bits of the dissocitiave realm on their own (If I interpreted yourself like I was suposed to ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)) 


I see the versatility of snorted MXE both for going on 3-MeO-PCP-like or 2-OxO-PCE-like journeys if you want, beeing pleasent on whatever ROA or use you want for it, compared, snorted 2-OxO-PCE really lacks something for beeing the queen of the party on recreative settings.

I don't think there's any way MXE won't make a return.  There's too much demand and it's not illegal everywhere.  I'm surprised it hasn't happened yet honestly.

It's not a street drug (unlike mephedrone in the UK for example, which is why it's still available there) and banned in pretty much all countries. It won't return on a larger scale.


Have you tried 2'-Oxo-PCE yourself? It's MXE without the 3-methoxy group. Maybe you'll like it just as much. And in every case it's better than mourning over disappeared RCs lol.

I felt more burning sensations when sublingualing this one, than when snorting it. Anyone else?

I also see addiction-potential with it.

Massive addiction potential. If I wasn't happy with my life I'd order 50 grams and waste away like I did years ago on MDPV (whatta bitch of a drug). 


I say that for the nasal route. I feel the oral is more.... fulfilling. 


I actually don't feel much burn at all. Just, like a tingling.

I think it describes the nasal ROA in specific doses very well, but "psychedelic" and "cocaine" put together seems somewhat paradox. But it will make sense after making friends with 2'oxo

Hm, it is stimulating, but i don't feel much of a dopaminergic rush. A little bit maybe. For me it is more some kind of "dissociative ecstasy". But I think, this could also be just for me that case, the serotonergic component ist strong here, because i'm taking St. John's Wort. Instant Robo-Flip. Hopefully it is not neurotoxic like DXM + Ecstasy, but I see there are some parallels in effects and feeling...

Synthetic, it's super interesting you say that. I medically went off my Mirtazapine under a doctors care. I actually feel I've lost some of the Ecstasy feeling and am getting more a cold push (again akin to coke but less.... just less). Maybe you are onto something about the serotonin changes?

The tests I made did not show o-pce to be very serotonergic. I think it may have reuptake inhibiting properties but I did not notice any kind of euphoric rush or something. It was more of a balanced plateau.. But this is just subjective.

I hear you on that man. Tbf it's the only way I can describe it to the people I know. As paradoxical as that description is.


I'm going to try this and it's cousin orally next time. I find the nasal ROA to be way too morish and thus I end up binging. With this beast that is a bad idea unless you enjoy days of uncomfortable dissociation. Not at all pleasant in the slightest.

You're right, this stuff will sooner or later lead to binges if used as  "psychedelic cocaine". It also is hard to estimate how the effects will add up after redosing. I one snorted 5mg and waited for around 5 hours and then snorted another 5mg which made the high way more than the sum of ist products.

Let me just say, yes, yes it leads to binges. My one gf has now banned me from using it around her. (This was post the month test) Turns out testing can be addictive..... haha but I found it rather easy to walk away from with the use of psychedelics, unlike trying psychedelics after PCP, Ketamine or MXE for kicking.


Point is I find the binges aren't bad as long as you have mental cushion for the comeback. 


Be safe.

In short, let's not water! Write the most worthy in your opinion dissociative after MXE. 


IN my opinion its - DXE

I've contributed about 3 reports. 2 of them were rejected by the community for me putting subjective feeling in there, so I took them down. My one report is still up somewhere a few pages back. Like MSK and I were saying, it has that indescribable effect. 


If I wasn't doing well in life, this could be the key to my failure. I won't credit my success to it. I found DXE (hate that name) to be a "fun drug"; not a novel compound like this.

I am today going to research how o-pce will interact with some codeine. I will stick to my maximum of 10mg throughout the day and will then consume about 150mg codeine later. ( I have low tolerance to both substances I guess, i had my last 150mg of codeine about 3 days ago, and my last o-pce 4 days ago and I did not use both long term and kept the doses at the same level). I have now consumed 5mg which brought the expected effects, maybe slightly weaker and I will see if I am going to consume further 5mg. 

I will let yall know if youre interested.


Regards,


UA


As like with DXM, I will give it a while to be metabolized before I add the codeine

No big synergy noted. Dissociation got stronger and I had a small panic once, where my heart rate went up. At all it was a cool night. 

I am done with testing this chemical any further because I am afraid of side effects and addiction

mh, I also thought it would not interact in a way, that other chemicals do. Stronger dissociation sounds nice, but overall it is nothing big I guess. I think Eticyclidone is not very addictive in comparison to MXE, I even think it healed me from my MXE craving. By now I tested it 4 times, ok, but at the moment I do really have no desire of do it again, especially when I think of the side effects. In 2 Weeks my St. Johns Wort reserve is empty, 2 weeks later I will test O-PCE again to see if it will have the serotonergic MDMA component I described earlier. I hope my blood pressure will stop to go up to valhalla with no AD's inside me. Normally I have pretty low blood pressures, but on O-PCE they are pretty high. Maybe also the damage on bladder and kidney comes from the high blood pressure I experienced. I also noticed, the damage on bladder is lesser pronounced as I took very low doses of Captopril (ACE-Inhibitor) on the trip of 20mg Eticyclidone. Maybe this is also important. These are just many many suggestions, but the substance has still indeed strong effects on mind and body.


Let's see where it will get us.

I used this as a background for a group trip night. 


The combos that were added were ald-52(taken right away, 250mcg), Methylone (60mg near the end to perk up), 5-meo-dmt (3 separate sessions of 10mg), bit of Diclazepam(a 2mg drink, I make sodas of them) for the end. 


The only one that changed much was when the 5-meo-DMT was added. It seemed to bring me close to the oral main effects of the 40 mg O-PCE trip pervious. I feel like there is a distinct change in effect. Like being dropped into a controlled virtual reality, unlike 5-meo-DMT normally does to me when I have to just go with the flow. 


My heart got up to 89 bpm, Oxygen levels never went below 97%. I was iffy about combos but this seems relatively safe in my body.

I am testing this O-PCE for the first time already now. I weighted 10 mg, split in three parts and put one under my tonge. My intention is to apply the other two the same way every hour or so. Is this a good pace in your oppinion?

 I am experienced on MXE and some K, but never developed a tolerance with any of them since I do not use them often.

I did the same. Also no tolerance. I split the 10mg into 2 parts, but 3 seems safer. 

It should give you a nice feel of what is coming

Well, my test was completed hours ago. This substance is strong and defnitely dissociative, interesting but in my oppinion it lacks the magic and warmth that mxe provides. Maybe I should not make a judgement from a so limited experience, but the fact is that I found it too cold, missing the well being I was expecting. Pretty fucntional at this low dose, good for sociability.

 Next time I will try 10 mg. at once and having another 5-10 mg. ready for redosing if I feel the need. Let´s see if this provides a different experience.


Underachiever: please let us know how your experience went. I am interested in knowing how different it was from mine.

I think I did so some pages ago.

It was to me a kind of neutral mood stabilizer and stimulant at 5-10mg. I was more focused and sociable but I sas strong dissociation coming up at larger doses. Definitely nothing to fuck with

Testing this 1 time 1 week since 4 weeks


Okay arylcyclohexylamine.

Still not k

Still not MXE

Have something MXE had but not K


Im currently wasted on this product and I can say the 2 first hours are cool but the neverending comedown and day after arent at all. Mxe was cool afterglow, O-PCE is crank flu hangover.


Aside that the 2 first hour are cool, first hour is basically extremely funny intellectual/physical mania and dissociation + funny body high/weird taste enhancement, and second hour is you sleeping and thinking in your bed with 2 neuron interacting with each other in your head while other one blackout or grill.


After the 2 first hours euphoria go down the rabbit hole and you are left with strong or sometime heavy annoying dysphoric residual dissociation where you feel cutted off this world/alien not in a good way hoping the next time you will find ketamine instead O-pce


In all okay product but not for frequent use


Its perhaps not that hard to synth mxe from o-pce thought ? Its just adding a 3meo group

First bioassay of the compound, after 6 months without almost touching dissos, 3mgs feels like a powerful medicine, fiendish, hole in a molecule kind of trip. Calm polyedric euphoria, flock of butterflies in the stomach, some peeks at the dark side. I would call her hollywood, for the sake of the holes in the most sacred sense.


Instant love affair, I have to see how it fades, if it does it nicely I will say this is gold. **Plutonium**. Will report after effects impresions later.

O-pce is less warm than MXE, more psychedelic, heavier body load and nause issues. Overall very heavy and cold disso. I dont get this lovely flying (gravity losing) with MXE and O-PCE, like I used to with DXM and Ketamine. I wanna fly, is there any rc dissos providing this feeling? :D

Every individual acts different.. Blah blah. 

I, for example, can relate to that warm floaty feeling of o-pce some are talking about. 

We can not give you adive on which drug will make you fly the way you want. Soak up information and find out yourself ;-)

DMT makes me fly. Haha, totally not what you're looking for though. I do like the haunting ability to just be "through" my doors after a 5-meo-DMT hit during a higher dose O-PCE trip. It's one of the closest to ketamine I've found, the combo.

Im going to say that O-PCE retains all the magic, spark and bloom of conexions that I missed from MXE. It´s heavier, less speedy but more calmed euphoria, less motor coordination. This is less party and more meditative, contemplative, reflexive, as I said, hole in a molecule.


It´s easier to sleep after than MXE as well and the next day afterglow is even more pronuncied with the antidepressive effect clearly lingering in.


To me is gold, but keep caution as is so potent that will cause trouble in the disrespectful users

I tried putting about 5mg (weighed 5mg on a +/-5 scale) on a bowl of marijuana, I felt speedy effects but I think it was placebo. That was a few weeks ago. Injection for me was too much, so I had less interest in smoking. I mean, I guess that means it doesn't kill me.... good to know. 


I felt strong anti-depression capabilities, but after I did the month test, it became dysphoria even when using sometimes.

I took O-PCE about 10 - 12 days ago the last time. With several days of abstinence and drinking every day ~ 2-3L of water my bladder regenerated and I nearly feel no effects anymore. I would recommend at minimum 2 weeks between two trips IF you have bladder or kidney issues.

O-PCE can be vaporized in freebase form. I assume o-pce freebase to be similar to freebase MXE which is unstable crystals at room temperature. I've only knocked the HCl off by using baking soda and a touch of water then smoking the oil/residue.


**update:** I was wrong. The freebase appears to be an oil at room temp (who's room are we in though? heh)


I tried vaporizing O-PCE in its salt form (HCl) once and found freebasing to be superior but it was only one trial.


Vaporizing the freebase is moreish. It's. So. Good.


Identical in taste, onset and effect to vaping freebase MXE: An acquired taste.

One question for experienced users: how does this substance affect the quality of your sleeping? I have used it only two times, at 8-10 mg doses, and both I could go to sleep after some hours (more or less at the same level as MXE), but I had a mostly restless night, waking often and not sleeping as deeply as usual. Not as terrible as with 3-meo-pcp, that did not let me sleep at all, but also anoying.

Vaporization I was hoping to save material. I like oral, but can't function at a club or bar, too much "wait, where are we?". That's why I went the nasal route which is just "psychedelic cocaine" but I find myself using 60-100mg (10-20mg bumps) a night. (I have pure product but crazy tolerance)


That's vs the single (sometimes twice in a day) oral dose (46mg is my sweet spot now) but that then wears off or leaves me too confused. 


I'm planning to do a DPT/Eticyclidone combo intramuscular injection soon. I've had a bunch of DPT that has been begging to play with diss's again. But if I can just do DPT injection and vape the eticyclidone.... then I think I would prefer that. (I'm chasing a ketamine/DPT-esqe void that I believe will be in this combo)


During the month I used it, I found myself sleeping a lot less but still feeling rested. Now when I use it here and there,  if I use it in the morning, I tend to take a nap in the afternoon or go into a very deep sleep during the night.

Im noone to judge noone else. But Im getting near hole experiences at 3-5mg. If your sweet spot is 46mgs you probably have gone a bit too far and a bit too fast... take it easy, man!

I have not tried oral so I can't compare it to vaping or insufflation. 


Insufflation requires a relatively small amount, has a fast smooth onset and no burn or other nasal discomfort. 


Vaping requires maybe half the amount (at least in my case. I like to think I'm vaping this very efficiently. Not burning it and not losing vape because I'm using a tube that's open on one end with a tiny hole so little to none gets out in between hits.) has a more jarring onset than insufflation, where I go from quickly coming up to peaking within a few minutes and an overall much shorter duration. It's more intense but shorter. It's easier for me to titrate how deep I want to go because it simply involves less tokes, waiting a bit between tokes, etc.


The main gripe I have with dissociatives is unlike nearly every other chemical, I can't tell how messed up I am compared to society's baseline. Time dilation, slurred speech, mobility, general awkwardness, is all NOT obvious while under the influence and is only evident in hindsight when explicitly pointed out by the sober (usually drug naive but nevertheless wonderful) members of society. I find I can take a lot of, say, MXE, and mumble my way through a few hours of life thinking I just aced that conversation or social event only to sober up and realize I really messed things up. 


And the worst thing is it has proved impossible thus far to get a sitter/any sober person to point out the blatant social menace that one-messed-up-on-dissociatives can be with enough conviction to cause this person to take a deep breath, say SORRY and THANK YOU and sit with head down and mouth closed in shame in the corner until sobering up. Instead I either brush this person off or feel too euphoric to imagine that this nitpicking about how coherent one sounds to be a big enough problem to address by shaming me when society has bigger problems on its hands, problems that may be very evident in the dissociative head state. "Dissociated" from society along with one's self is a pretty accurate and probably one of the desired effects of these substances. To me anyway. 


That being said, I like vaping because I can enjoy the craziness of this head space in a more controlled manner and should I overdo it (which as of now has been 100% of the time) I'll be back to baseline in no time.

Hey. I took 500 mg (do not ask me why - I do not know) and got epileptic seizure. My lower lip badly swollen, I had severe cramps, I also hit my head and suffered a concussion. After that I went to the emergency department of the hospital.

But the saddest thing is that I took a bite of the tongue, which is not able to recover, and now I have a noticeable speech impediment.

That was a really terrible idea. 2'-Oxo-PCE seems to be ~3x more potent than MXE? MXE killed ~30 people. It's certainly possible to OD on it. You were lucky to survive.

Until early 2014, 20 deaths in the EU alone. 8 of that were just MXE without any other substances involved.


[http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/publications/risk-assessment/methoxetamine](http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/publications/risk-assessment/methoxetamine)


MXE most likely killed more people than 25I-NBOMe did. But you can't mention that online without being attacked by MXE lovers & addicts 8)

Sorry but 30 deaths is almost 4 times the actual number of 8. 

A drug killed 8 people??? That's hardly seems like a dangerous epidemic. 

And I'm pretty sure 25i-Nbome has killed more than 8 all on it's own so please don't compare the two. 

I really do like MXE but if it turns out to be actually dangerous then I will abandon it like I have with 25i. 

Of those 8 deaths (Edit: also, 4 of the total deaths were due to "drowning" not drug overdose) do we no what the circumstances death actually were??? Nope. 

Did they inject? Who knows...

The other 22 deaths were from mixed drug interactions which is brutally unfair to blame on MXE. That's straight up Darwinism at it's finest. 

If MXE turns out to be dangerous then so be it but please, let's not start comparing it to the NBOMe series. 

A few people die from totally safe over the counter drugs every year. 

Everyone's different remember, but let's call it what it really is, 8 deaths were we really don't know enough about the circumstances to make an informed judgment vs how many people that have shovelled MXE up their noses or whatever with no problem.

Mxe is most definitely dangerous in terms of careless use. Don't start pretending we know anything more than real studies and statistics about the safety of these drugs. Both the NBOMe series and MXE can cause serious problems. 


My point is these are research chemicals and we don't want to push for banning. Titration and Sitters... please be safe and don't ruin the scene like meph did, and possibly mxe with all the people that chase it now in new drugs.

How do you know that all 25I-NBOMe deaths were caused by its own and not combinations with other drugs? Something as simple as caffeine could contribute to it.


I'm not saying that MXE is very dangerous, but it's certainly possible to kill yourself with it. It's not the safest drug around.

Instead I either brush this person off or feel too euphoric to imagine that this nitpicking about how coherent one sounds to be a big enough problem to address by shaming me when society has bigger problems on its hands, problems that may be very evident in the dissociative head state. "Dissociated" from society along with one's self is a pretty accurate and probably one of the desired effects of these substances. To me anyway.

To me it happens the oposite, I rarely use disociatives out of my home, and my flatmate is so used to see me either on disos, a lot of depressants, or psychedelics, that he'll point me out that I'm acting weird when I'm sober, not when I'm high xDDD

I think it's very wise to bring up that people have died while on MXE for sake of harm reduction for sure but mixing drugs isn't the same thing as taking a recreational dose of something and dying - which apparently has happened on 25i. 

People have taken staggering amounts of MXE and walked away and I'm in no way condoning that sort of thing - I've never taken more than 125mg nasally and that's my max dose. 

I very much believe in harm reduction and smart, safe drug use but I do feel that MXE and the NBOMe series are worlds [universes) apart in terms of danger if taken a reasonable (non heroic) dose once in a while.

I should have snorted more than 50g's easily of MXE in two years, with daily use and heavy binges, and I'm still here and functional. I've pushed it really far on dosage, and combos, and never had a bad experience with it. I can't imagine what crazy stuff did those people that died on MXE :S

I have to look at that report again, but I did study it, and if I remember correctly of those 8 deaths only one case listed the cause of death as acute MXE toxicity. The other cases involved asphyxiation, drowning etc. all of which could have been prevented with a proper trip sitter.


And now thanks to Sweet Share we are seeing a similar 'therapeutic index' from O-PCE, in that a dosage of an order of magnitude larger than a common dose may not be acutely fatal but does pose significant risk of damage to the internal organs as well as risk of harm due to the extreme level of dissociation. 


If you do do something stupid, at least have a trip sitter around to: a) talk you out of it, or if all else fails, b) make sure you don't leave the room, choke on vomit, bite off your tongue etc.

Which ROA is the least physically impairing ? I only tried insufflation of low doses and I found it annoying, that I did not realize mental effects but could not move without effort, anymore. So I decided to read a non-fictional book on a bench and I could comprehend the rather difficult topic okay.


Could somebody compare this to the 3-MeO-PCx in the low-medium dose range, differentiating between mental and physical effects and rating those with -10 to 10 points in terms of strength of the impairment, 10 meaning impairment on hole level ?


I only tried this three times in low doses and a comparison for low doses for me would look like this :


Dose : 5-10mg


ROA : insufflation


3-MeO-PCP => Physical : 5/10 (floating, the feet are not felt anymore, the contact with a surface feels like your limbs are melting into the material, motor skills otherwise are still okay), Mental : minus 5/10 (if anything the mind is more sharp, but not impaired at all)


3-MeO-PCE => Physical : 2/10 (very light floating, but mostly the motor skills are maintained, night vision is enhanced in my opinion, could be bullshit), Mental : minus 2/10 (the giggle-effects tend to create the impression, that one is impaired, but otherwise arguable better than sober)


2-OxO-PCE => Physical : 7/10 (felt sluggish like on a medium dose of alcohol ), Mental : 0/10 (no effects perceived)

Low doses of 2-OxO-PCE aren't really enjoyable for me, as they are 3-MeO-PCP doses. With this one I prefer to push it up a bit and go to schizofrenicland, than undertake it and just feel weird. Oral is the ROA for those ones IMHO, if you want to feel full effects, snorting those ones is weaker, and usually more stimulating. 


If I understand well, for you 3-MeO-PCP>3-MeO-PCE>2-OxO-PCE? 


How would you compare 3-MeO-PCP to 3-MeO-PCE?

First off, I just wanted to say,the DPT/Eticyclidone combo was a failure. Heart rate around 112-123bpm. I mean, it was enjoyable..... just lackluster. Not what I had expected. 


Ziiirp, I am just saying.... it kind of sounds like you dislike the class of drug.


Which dissociatives do you enjoy? 


Ketamine and PCP both impair you physically quite strongly. These analogs are all relatively light compared to those two, but maybe the diphenidine/Ephenidine types might be more your style. 


In my opinion, anything that impairs you mentally enough to be euphoric or insightful with dissociatives, you would also have severe motor impairment.

Why would you say dpt/eti was a failure? How much/roa did you end up with on both?


Mxe/dpt is combo supreme #1. Plugging them at the same time = same time onset and is amazing.

80mg DPT nasal about 20 minutes after 25mg Eticyclidone sub/oral. I got the "tremors" and my day lasted, what felt like 10 days, but not in a "normal" time dilatation...  it was different more attention on the time. I didn't get much color.

Actually that is relatively close to my break through for both. 80mg DPT (im'd) is my breakthrough, that's why I tried that dose. PCP is usually 10-12, I still kinda prefer the new way to the classic here but that could have been so I'm excited if it works out...

You just have to a bit careful, DPT(especially IM..)can be wicked! Much more so than DMT! More unpredictable! I've done both through every ROA you could think of and I'm a diss/psychedelic veteran, too much DPT on a good diss trip can turn it sideways unless your experienced to pay the consequences for tolling at that gate... I'll tell this though, DPT/ket or MXE, or 3-MeO-PCP/plain PCP gotten right, is..."Gods terroritory", it's amazing to stroll through, and gawk at, but you'll pay the price for admission, if you don't get it right...!![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

Indeed you do! Just throwing warnings out there though! DPT can be rather wicked though I love it for that! The main thing is working out the DPT doses, I always prefer them higher(80-180mgs IM), but this is where some people find..."trouble" in the waters!

further thoughts on this.


Has anyone noticed the main place for the 94% clumpy powder is now sending finer, denser and apparently 98% purity (according to packet) stuff?


It may just be my tolerance but ive last less success with this "improved" batch


My standard dose is 2 x 30mg snorted an hour apart. But now this isnt doing so good. I can still feel it certainly, but its nowhere near enough for the euphoria i get from it and doesnt dissociate as strongly.


Anyone notice these differences or is it just me?


Also - i tried a combination of 30mg 3-meo-pce (which i found lacklustre overall, if pleasant enough) with 20-30mg o-pce a few hours in.


This combination was indeed glorious , and i felt fucking mad but in the best possible way.

It would be very helpful to read some reports where people did not compare it to MXE or talk about how it is not a replacement for MXE. Yes, we know! Wouldn't a more classical comparison be ketamine anyway? 


With that said, would the consensus be that oral or sublingual is the best ROA here? I always IM my ketamine and I did with MXE (which for the record, I found completely cold and clinical unlike K and DXM) and my singular trial with 4-MeO-PCP. 


There are some troubling reports that no one seemed to acknowledge about blood pressure and heart rate increases with this one. Did anyone else notice those issues? One person experienced those problems with IM. Although it is my beloved ROA for dissociatives (except for DXM, of course), I might have to forgo IM with this one... 


After reading this entire thread, I also cannot be sure that a hole is possible. For me, dissociatives are only meant for holing. I might have to pass on this altogether if there is no hole to be found, and just stick to my beloved ketamine (which has never bothered my bladder that I can observe, not even after a gram in one night).

For my only two light bioassays with OPCE Im pretty much possitive that holing is totally factible. I would say this is the most pro-hole sustance ever.


OTOH, theres some users claiming that OPCE is a bitch raising your tolerance, pretty much forever, when you compare with K, MXE or the rest of dissos.Personally Im not taking it anymore as Im in love with dissospace and I just don´t want to burn it prematurely. If you are a moderate-heavy user of OPCE I would love to read your impressions regarding tolerance.


In my second bioassay it was clear that the trip was way less dissointeresting that the first one.

I agree that novel psychoactive substances should be appreciated for their own character, but I think that we're seeing so many comparisons to MXE rather than ket because most of the demographic interested in O-PCE is more interested in research chemicals as opposed to street drugs to begin with, and it seems likely that many of the individuals sampling O-PCE are not able to draw a comparison to ket because they haven't tried it.

I hole on it orally easier than nasally. The I.M. is a kinda instant "experience"... I don't know if that's what some would call a hole though. 


Orally/Sublingually definitely can make a hole state. My doses were very high to get there though.

I give this another try, because I did it wrong (low nasal doses). What is a threshold dose orally, in order to create an experience similar to that caused by low 3-MeO-PCP nasally applied doses ?

   Between 2-Oxo-PCE and 3-MeO-PCP you won't find any similitude, so don't try to use this one as a substitute of low 3-MeO-PCP doses. Oral dose for this one is 20-25mg. Anything under that dosage you will only find disconfort and confusion. And the high of snorted o-PCE is not really something I will do again, nothing special.  IME this one is only worthable on high doses.... And on it's own it doesn't really shine, at least for me. I need to smoke weed and drink a few beers when I dose o-PCE if I want to go to some interesting places, otherwhise the high lacks something by itself.    I think in the future I'll push this one to the 60mg oral range, without adding any other drugs to the experience, just for science, bitches. I want to know how the original o-PCE hole is like, because I experienced some crazy headspaces when I combined it with psychedelics, cannabis, alcohol, or other candies.   For me, o-PCE is a transdimensional potentiator, but by itself is really shitty...

That sucks. Low doses of 3-MeO-PCP accurately resemble long meditation sessions without producing childish serotonergic giggles or unnerving after effects. But that is illegal in U-Rope now.

Hello there, here is my state:

i stopped taking St. Johns Wort since 2 weeks ago. 

Now i can take 5-12mg 2-oxo-pce without getting terrible headaches and also the over impulsive reactions are over. Also I am no more in a phase of stress and haste due to my life situation.

The more I get to know this substance, the more I feel it has antidepressant, nootropic and stimulant properties. These are the positive effects. But no positive effect is gifted, so there have to be downsides.

I assume there are some issues with the bladder, but with enough water and healthy food this issue can maybe fixed over the time. I will from now on maybe check more organs with keto-stix or so. 


But without other psychoactive substances in my blood and brain I feel less physical downsides. So therefore I will now ask you guys if you have experienced negative effects like addiction, cognitive impairment or even issues with the cardiovascular system. The last time i checked my blood pressure on 2-oxo-pce I had 145/82 with a puls of 62. A little bit high pressure, nothing you want to have constantly, but it has to be considered none the less

  Well, addiction depends on the person that takes the drug. For me, nearly all dissociatives are high addictive, while opiates, like high quality heroin HCl  like I used to snort in the past, is something I can pass my life without trying ever again.   As far as negative effects on the long term, this is a new, unresearched substance. Anybody knows what this can unchain with chronic use.   BTW, I was a ketamine/MXE daily user for three years, and now I spare my 3-MeO-PCP and o-PCE usage between 1-2 weeks, and I work as web developer without any problems... I only have good things to say about dissos, they improved my life for a lot better. But probably, in the future, when I'm old, I'll see the damage I made to my body and mind with such irresponsible use in the past. Take care!

Well, i was using DXM a lot, but this substance is clearly damaging organs over a long period of time. But it also showed me a perspective on life i would never even have seen if i had been sober my whole life. I also have experience with MXE/MXM and now some with 2-oxo-pce. MSK: your information about your long term usage of ketamine/MXE is valuable, i would like to know more details about your prognosis.


And yes, i am absolutely willing to take care of myself, that's why I am asking about the price of this subtances on the body. I have plenty effects on my body and mind, but i would like to know where they are coming from, i would say I had used some substances in the past, there is a very wide palette. Now it is time to differentiate everything and cutting off the bad things like opioids, alcohol and cannabinoids (just for me bad things, maybe someone other has more benefits with those substances).

As far as I know my bladder was really damaged with the chronic usage, at my 26 years I go to the bathroom more times than my grandfather, and with some effort. On the mind I feel my memory is fucked up too, but I supose cannabis daily use since teenager affected me more than my disso use on that matter

Well i am planning to regenerate the memory with Noopept, since it is cleary improving my memory and learning process. But maybe 2-oxo-pce has a higher neuroprotective aspect than MXE, so maybe Noopept is not even necessary. I also will clearly have an eye on the bladder issues, avoiding alcohol and junk food are the first steps to improve the function of mostly organs anyway. 


Taking St.Johns Wort and even more the phase after taking it showed me, that substances with an antidepressant effect are useful to lift up my mood and productivity. I am 27 years old and finished my academic studies at an university despite my irregular drug use of nearly every class. I also know that prescripted AD drugs have equivalent pros and cons, maybe even better than some medical doctors since I am pharmacist. But I also have in mind to visit a doctor for documenting my case. I want to thank you guys for information and you will hear from me in the future, when i gathered more information. Stay safe and greetings

When it comes to AD medication, these don't work because over time the feelings change and both Eticyclidone and 3-meo-pcp; and I suspect 3-meo-pce all become more physical and increase the bladder issues very quickly. I also visit the bathroom frequently but I can manage that. 


I also notice a lot of heart issues but I have preexisting conditions from my MDPV and MXE addictions. They have increased a lot since using Eticyclidone to the point that I can't take 4-aco-DMT with it because my heart rate goes down to about 44 bpm at its lowest, which just doesn't feel good on the body.

I would say the stronger and longer lived the compound, the lighter in the bladder. So K and Fluoro K should be the most damaging, while 3-meos the less. MXE and OPCE would be in a medium to low damaging range.


That would be if all they produce toxic metabolites for the bladder, which only are confirmed, as far as I know, in Ket

This is a really powerful substance that should be treated with utmost respect and care. I am still feeling some after-effects about 10 hours after my last dose. As of right now I am sitting at work, comfortably typing and capable of speaking pretty clearly, although I know I am still impaired.

This was my second experiment with 2'-OXO-PCE, the first one took place about 7 days ago with a mild trial at around 10-15mg total oral in three separate doses over the course of 2 hours. That evening went by without any problems, and I had noted that this compound seemed to be a worthy NMDA antagonist, from it's effects at very low dosage considering my tolerance.


In 2014 I abused MXE fairly heavily, and before that I used to abuse DXM syrups almost daily, hence I am quite cozy in dissociated headspaces and the motor impairment is no surprise to me. In my time of MXE abuse, there were a few events where I would blackout after a large IM dose, ususally over 120mg. The usual reaction, as noted by those who were around me at the time, was that I was completely unresponsive, had elevated heart rate and tense muscles, severe motor discoordination etc. I had a similar event this night after a final redose of 35mg in my left thigh. Here goes:


4:30PM First dose, about 10mg insufflated. No burn, slight chemical sensation and taste but nothing uncomfortable. Felt an alert around 15 minutes in and the effects started to manifest at 20-25 minutes mark. Slight agitation and mild signs of impending mania, I am feeling very good at this moment because it reminds me of "the good ol' days", that feeling I once had when abusing MXE and feeling confortably out of it, having fun without a care in the world.


5:30PM insufflate about 5-8mg more. I was anxious to get the trip going on but surprisingly I was able to hold out for a good hour while I was waiting to get some sterile injection supplies. I spent some time chatting with my mother, quietly enjoying the feeling in the background while my behaviour wasn't  yet completely out of whack.


7PM First IM dose, I decide that I can definitely go for 15mg IM, seeing that 15mg oral did very little but wet my palate. Excellent call, this dose and ROA is everything I'm looking for. Clean dissociation, my mind is stimulated and my body slightly disconnected, this reminds me of IM MXE, to be quite honest, but it was different in some respects. 


First off, it is much more potent than MXE. Also I did feel much crazier while I was on 2'-OXO-PCE, my train of thought was pure confusion and mania, and I must admit that I enjoy that. 

So throughout the night I had a few more IM shots, always around 20mg; When the plateau was beginning to shoot back down, I would kick it back up again. I had a friend come over a bit later, he understood I was fucked up but I could still manage to hold some kind of conversation, nothing very deep but I could still speak to human beings. Nothing much to say here, I absolutely enjoyed that compound, perhaps even more so than I used to love MXE.


And naturally, it pretty much always ends up like that with me, once I've had a few doses, I usually feel up for a stronger shot, just to get a good feel of the raw power of the molecule I'm experiencing. I couldn't tell you what time it was exactly when I shot up,  but I did take my time and make an amusing ritual out of it, giving absolutely no thought to the work day I would have to endure afterwards.


The shot was about 38mg, injected in my left thigh. I remember completing the injection and disposing of the equipment, but afterwards there is a void in my memory. I was sitting at my computer table, watching a video and probably listening to music. The next thing I remember is my sister and mother helping me get up and giving me some breakfast food, since it was now around 7AM. 


My mother told me she was awoken by my screaming, and she found me face up against wall, loudly moaning uncomprehensibly against it for no apparent reason. My computer space was wrecked, there was pieces of glass on the floor and all sorts of stuff just laying around in a total mess. I spent some of the morning cleaning that up and sobering up before work. 

I can only guess that I tried to get up and with the utter lack of motor control I must have ended up falling against the table, smashing everything in the process. 

I can say that I have been shown that lesson more than once, hopefully this time I can learn from it. Stay safe, guys and gals. Be very careful with this one.

For what it's worth, I notice significant cardiorespiratory depression from 4-aco-dmt by itself. So much so that I've generally come to feel uncomfortable combining it with sedatives. Are you sure that what you're noticing is a reaction to the combination of this drug with 4-aco-dmt, and not something that just happens typically for you on 4-aco-dmt (but without you noticing)?

I check my heart rate frequently, I generally get the depression down to about 60bpm from an average 70-75bpm or an upping to 90bpm with 4-aco-DMT by itself. 44bpm is much lower than that, to the point of feeling changes. My O2 levels where 96% from a normal 98%. Again, that's a couple times out of the roughly 55 different days (usually with multiple doses in a day) I've taken it. I wouldn't worry TOO much, but something to take into consideration for those thinking of a combo with benzos or opioids.

Definitely good information to have on record. Thanks for that. 


Hmm. 


O-PCE does look an awful lot like pethidine or ketobemidone or prodine. I haven't kept much track of reports from this substance, has anyone speculated opioid activity? I would be very willing to believe such a claim--especially at the relatively high doses people are using this drug at. 


That would also explain why people are saying the drug is unusual suited for "holing" on, and that it's better at higher (ie. above threshold for subjective opioid activity) rather than lower (ie. subthreshold) doses.


My suspicion is that the N-ethyl chain plus the ketone make a decent enough approximation of the ethyl carboxylate chain on pethidine. Meanwhile, loss of that ethyl chains abolishes affinity (see norpethidine, norketamine), and 3-methoxylation a la MXE likely abolished affinity for the most part as well. 


If this is true, then this is one to play with *very* carefully.

I would not say, that I dislike dissos generally, in fact I see great potential for all I've tried as emotional catalysts. 3-MeO-PCP is an incredible functional enhancer for creative processing. Rational thinking and learning abilities might be slightly impaired (didn't try much formal thinking on it), but there was felt a profound connection to some inner eternal truths and the fearlessness and enhanced compassion in morbid reflections/conversations can be useful in evaluating socially evoked superficial relationships towards the concepts of life and death. That is also the reason I did not try higher doses, because this clinical morbidity is nothing to fuck with.

MXP on the other hand was less functional and much more emotional/melancholic for me. It is very good for cleansing yourself of emotional tension. For me it was the best "crying"-inducer, because the tears felt natural and not forced, opposed to sad episodes in 5ht2a-trips, which I did not like.


3-MeO-PCE is good, but a bit too serotonergic for my taste. Reminds me of 4-HO-MET (without visuals).


On the other hand I never tried high doses of any disso. So I could not experience the full mind altering potential (holing). If O-PCE only is useful for holing, then it may be not for me, that is correct.


With all dissos despite (insufflated) O-PCE the mental state could be altered, before the physical sluggishness was predominating.

Now that I've gotten over my infatuation with Eticyclidone, I must say that from the way this chemical acts: this is a gem of a chemical. 


I really enjoyed it. I also feel, unlike ketamine, that it's more of an escape or social lubricant on par with alcohol. Just in a different fashion. 


I find 10-15mg oral solution to be about the same as waking up "happy drunk". 


Don't get me wrong, I've had amazing experiences at the higher doses but it's like taking a electric cattle prod to the brain. 


When mixed 3-meo-pce, I found to be highly euphoric. 


Ziiirp, I'm sorry for calling you out. I hadn't meant to but I did. I apologize.

I'm pretty confused about the different reactions. Some people make it out to be pretty great, but others seem to strongly warn about it.


Considering I can't weigh it properly for a little while (though volumetric measurement is an option), I decided to skip my order for the time being since I really don't want to risk dangerous trips.

I do have experience in the past with schizo MXE breaks on very high doses, but am not looking for those anymore. On the other hand I have always been able to use 3-MeO-PCP safely, without hazarding into higher doses where people get severely lost... so I'm gonna return to that for now ... volumetric it is - and I'll be going on my extensive experience with it, I have even taken it supplementally and frequently eyeballed ~3 mg without fail. However I must say that I will never take any disso supplementally like that again, and should definitely report it in the 3-MeO-PCP thread because I believe it really dumbs you down + is possibly just not helpful as AD in the long run + it seems to cause something like atrophy.


But doing 3-MeO-PCP occasionally again will be a welcome resort.


Maybe will consider 3-MeO-PCE in the future, which I have *some* experience with but found to be both manic and on the comedown scattering and disturbing.. 

I wish 2-F-DCK and 2-TFM-DCK werent so expensive / unavailable, cause I miss K and 2-F was quite like it.


Is O-PCE really doable to use with moderation like I am able to use 3-MeO-PCP to just fade away nicely? Losing motor control and K-like trippiness wouldn't bother me, but I am very wary of having to 'titrate' and discover unwanted schizo-ness, or that beastliness you guys are reporting.

See, that is whyy pcp isn't as big as ketamine these days. a lot of people just don't dig it. Me, I do, oh how I do. :D


Regarding our question, I used it IM on my first trial and while 32mg was a good dose, another 20 or 25mg two hours later knocked me the fuck out for eight hours straight. I literally sunk to my knees on my way to the bed. I could not form new memories for hours after I was able to talk again. I have taken a *lot *of dissociatives in my life and this has never happened before, not even with pcp where I felt the dose response curve was more linear.

Actually I am still sorta surprised that I always have such good self control with 3-MeO-PCP, maybe it's because with K and MXE, I feel like you can get away with abusing them, even if with MXE you can still completely lose the plot, and that's why eventually I often did. But with 3-MeO-PCP and also diphenidine type stuff (but I almost haven't explored them), the reports of people having horrible things happening works so well as a warning that I make damn sure that I stay well on the right side of the police tape so to speak.

Who knows, maybe that means that the same translates to O-PCE, and taking enough care would allow me to take it safely, but for now I'm not taking that chance. The phrase 'most abusable of all' doesn't make me exactly comfortable regarding that.

OTOH, its not like 3-MeO-PCP or 3-MeO-PCE have such a huge therapeutic index either, and you almost doubled your dose... So, I'm sure you are very well versed in these, but you also seem like you love to take it very far, or compulsively do even. Anyway just thinking out loud, trying to answer whether the therapeutic index of O-PCE is doable to tackle without trial and major error.


There are some things that after years I have a hard time learning, and finding out the hard way each time. But fully realizing that with some dissociatives, especially the lipophilic stacking ones, at some point you've just had enough if you don't want accidents even if you are not really satisfied, that fortunately I learned without having to go through a trainwreck myself.

Fortunately, cause it wouldn't exactly have been a huge surprise if I was one of you wrecked guys, think of all the accidents these last years. I mean bladder damage isn't pretty either but banning dissociatives apparently only made people resort to ever more fantastical but hardcore disso's... Maybe the direct ketamine analogues of most recent will be kind of a nice welcome back. Not great for bladders everywhere, but maybe better for the psycho episodes.

Better that way... Only we, the chosen ones, seems to be able to enjoy and be buying them.  We seem also to be pretty well formed on harm reducion and with a lot of  experience in drug culture and polidrug use in general. That's why I  wish those ones don't get popular between the masses and all those  teenagers that are making that UK is making a ban now that will probably  mean the dissapearence in the future of -phenidine compounds on the  market, and that already helped to the making of the last chinese ban  that fucked all us up with MXE. So, please, people. Don't take this  ones. They're really shitty substances, they don't deserve to be  consumed. Just stick to your fucking cheap phenidines kiddos, and don't lead the goverment attention to 3-MeO-PCP, 3-MeO-PCE, 2-OxO-PCE,  2-OxO-PCM, and much more to came (I hope!)

I could see medical value in 3-MeO-PCP (possibly the -PCE too) so MAYBE the government could look at those but I really love your idea. I should stop saying this is any good...


I actually found this one somewhat easy to not go TOO overboard on once I got a feel for dosing, but I feel like you do need to find a sweet spot on this one. Not one I would suggest jumping into, even for the hardheaded. (Compared to MXE and Ketamine; and street PCP which I haven't done in a bit now)


Has anyone found any actual data on any possible serotonin (or other) changes? I am curious as I saw what the difference in serotonin did to 3-MeO-PCE and 3-MeO-PCP. Just interested in the comparison and didn't see it on the chart in the other thread.

Oh boy, the original PCP... Chasing it for years, never found it. This week I managed to find on the deep web and as I was skeptic as fuck I sent to analyze and it was 3-MeO-PCP... It could be worst, 3-MeO-PCP is a welcome, thought I paid it a bit more than usual from it thinking I was buying PCP ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)

I quite enjoy O-pce And may be acquiring 10g  for tests,  research and combinations 


10-20mg IM dose Was easily better than mxe in terms of. Euphoria, relaxation, easy to be one with the music. Different. Of course  .....Bit of a wobble , but with weed, and a stim or without at first ( easy going one  not meth nor mdpv nor crack etc. ) dancing was fantasmaical


I have not explored a hole yet, but I feel a force which could induce such a state


Oh. And. These chems. Like o-pce are giving  very interesting non scary visuals. This could be a very interesting chem,

Maybe psychosomatic but 3g in 4 weeks daily feels like a good lesson in why one should not disturb the complex symbiotic relationship our body has with probiotics.


Whether this is an antibiotic or not, I notice weird effects on skin. Feels dry, painful to make a fist as if skin isn't as elastic, dry nostrils that take a full day or two to resolve, general malaise and discomfort, random inflammation and fevers (one day one ear was inflamed, next day one hand, etc.)


I don't generally get sick and have never had such effects from drugs. I noticed that while I have a strong psychological desire to dose dissociatives, with this one the desire is there but there's something psychologically stopping me from attempting further experiments with this. Like my body has associated that the pros don't outweigh the cons here and until further reports come out I should keep clear.


A shame as this is otherwise a wonderful chem.


ROA is vaping freebase and some insufflation.


Sidenote: I see 3-MeO-PCP come up a lot here in discussion. I find O-PCE to be close to MXE in effects, if we have to compare. Can't say I don't enjoy it but 3-MeO-PCP's potency and long onset coupled with severe amnesia makes it undesirable for me personally. And I don't find much in common with 3meopcp and mxe, as opposed to, say, mxe and K. Not a fan of trying to fit one chems mold into another however.

 well, the magic of 3-meo-pcp is not beeing at all like ketamine or MXE. It can't be seen as a replacement for anything ;P The same for nearly everything, though, looking for sustitutions is looking for deception

If you take it very literally then yes, nothing is ever the same as something else... but of course it's not weird to look for a trait like for example the anaesthetic hole of K where stimulating effects don't prevent the holing, or the lighthearted prankster humor of MXE. I agree that as far as expectations go, identical replacements will always disappoint because you set yourself up to focus on the imperfection of trying to replicate something.


I'm glad that there are very close K analogues now, which have very similar qualities. I appreciate MXE as something unique and 3-MeO-PCP as well while 3-MeO-PCE is mostly a more manic version of 3-MeO-PCP that has tendencies that start out masquerading as Zen-like serenity, then MXE-reminiscent prankster mood, and soon enough delusions of grandeur.


Diphenidine felt like a fuckton of static to me but I didn't like it.


But back to the point: it is useful for people to compare because it gives quality descriptions using other drugs as reference points. I don't mind at all if people describe O-PCE's effect in that way, and wonder if it has that manic touch of 3-MeO-PCE, or that creepy schizo touch of R-ketamine.

I have to admit, while I've only experimented with 3-meo-pce once over a 3 day period, that is quite an accurate description of how it progressed for me in that short amount of time. Still, overall I loved it more than anything else in the family outside of MXE

isn't the mania/no feelings of fear one of the best things about the 3-meo dissos? idk about you but I love feeling like the baddest mother fucker alive..... cocaine mania is shit compared to 3-meo-pcp/pce + small amount of stim mania


hate the strange gait you get (but I get it from every disso), but it goes away fast if you're not dosing all the time


as for the brain fog.... the worst brain fog i had was from ssris (and anxiety, inabilty to feel anything, problems with my dick and bad wds (and I still don't feel 100% right and low dose antipsyhotics (not to mention they made me extremely aggressive (only lasted for a day or less), unable to form words (lasted a few days) and bad extrapyramidal side effects which lasted for a week after only a day on them).... oh I got them from a psych for anxiety---- didnt work...... no drug ever gave me sides that bad 


another psych wanted to up my lyrica to 300mg, asked why  since I don't get more relief but the chance of addiction/sides is higher... no explanation


another one said i'm probably anxious from taking eth-lad on the weekend before.... asked how could i be anxious my entire life from that


my gp gives me 3x25mg lyrica and low doe diazepam every so often (told her that i can buy grams of stronger and funner benzos to get high) and that the diazepan is strictly for medical issues (got 30x2mg in september and ran out this month... have an appointment tomorrow and ask for more.....

O-PCE has become the closest one to MXE for me. Tried like 5-6 times now, doses ranging from 10-40mg. Redosing is making the trip extremely long, so I'm trying to stick to one dose only. My sweet spot is 35-40mg (sublingual). I have few questions for more experienced users.


When I did my research first, the doses people were saying it is strong were like 15-20mg. Seeing that I really liked 35-40, is this too much? (Lests consider the source is trustworth and the o-pce is of high quality) Because I don't have any tolerance. 


During my last trip, I put my mask on ([https://azarius.net/images/resize/large/06377-11-mindfold.jpg](https://azarius.net/images/resize/large/06377-11-mindfold.jpg)) you can open your eyes without any disturbance from the mask, it is pitch dark. Few seconds later I lost the feeling of my body totally, it was like floating in the space, felt like I was actually in an infinite black area. Is this hole?

Holes come in different shapes and sizes so to speak ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)  They can be quite different experiences when compared, but IMO what defines and unites them all is pretty much completely severed connection with the outside world.


You took a compound that apparently has holing potential, and added sensory deprivation... that is a pretty good recipe ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) But it's not like it isn't possible to walk around eyes open and be in a hole, if the person in question is *completely* elsewhere, all but physically.. that all qualifies wouldn't you agree?


I guess semantics on this matter vary between cultures, individuals, etc - but personally I would suggest that if you wanna get technical it's best to pretend it's similar to checking off DSM criteria (in this case pertaining to severance of interaction: dissociation of the internal mental compound from sensory interaction).


Haven't holed very much as of recent (since things like 3-MeO-PCP don't lend themselves so safely for it as K which I used years ago), but I recall discussions involving people that IMO mistake the appearance of someone holing for the actual experience: you don't have to be anaesthesized lying somewhere unresponsive for it to be a hole - that is merely the expectation of a spectator. The person who is dissociated really doesn't care experientially whether he is immobilized or not - as long as it's a completely internal experience (so yes progressive unresponsiveness is certainly a big indicator thats true, since that is inevitable if interactions with the world are severed, both ways).


I liked my mindfold, but I competely wore it down ;p


There is a 'what is a k-hole?' thread if you follow the PD psychedelic Index, go to the ketamine thread and find the subtread in the OP, I'm pretty certain.

2 trials with this one and  not sure what to think


It becomes very hard to walk I know that, and I also know that it kinda killed a really good ald-52 trip, so if your thinking it may potentiate a psych like MXE it does not

Thanks so much for the thorough reply sir, much appreciated :D In that case my experience was definitely not a hole, but more like a dream like state enchanced by sensory deprivation. Yet I really liked it actually.

 that's true for you, don't generalize. I only take this one with psychedelics and they sinergize better than anything I ever tried. Also, hardcore dissociation + hardcore visuals.

As of late, when I use ALD-52, I tend to use Eticyclidone alongside it.


1P-LSD was okay with it.


Combined great with 4-Aco-DMT.  The tail end of it went great with 5-MeO-MiPT. 


Was not a big fan of it with 4-OH-MET. 


It's very fun with 5-MeO-DMT.

  I can report insane sinergy between 4-AcO-DET/4-HO-MET/ETH-LAD/LSD + 3-MeO-PCP/o-PCE. I tried some combinations and I always seemed to enjoy an awesome trip. I would never reach those highs with only psychedelics, or only o-PCE. I feel it's a tool for combining.

In my experience, 3-MeO-PCP could be seen as a replacement for DXM. I find them to be very similar, but 3-MeO-PCP has way less nausea and negative body load.

That's interesting to read, anyone can relate to this as well? Never tried DXM because I'm not into drinking excipients and nausea, but if the high is something a disso connoisseur must try, I'll probably try to score some pure powder.

the disso perspective spectrum is way wide.. mania triggers and all..


yes dxm can go the limits, yes its otc legal... wonky could say the same with 3meopcp 

but please dont equivalent and group it like that someone naive will jump from cvs to pcp.. no..no..no..

Taking probiotics with antibiotics generally doesn't do a whole lot from what I understand, I would think its hard to maintain proper intestinal flora when you are bombarding your system with antibiotic. I'm still unclear on if this compound is actually antibiotic or antiviral, and to what extent. I'm definitely not gonna guinea pig this one though, too many unknowns. Sucks cause it seems fun, but I guess I really don't need more drugs. 


Xaxex, there are many herbs that would likely be much more useful in preventing uti and keeping organs healthy. PM me if you want specific info. I've been thinking of starting a thread with a list of herbs that have traditionally been used to maintain organ functions, or perhaps an herbal tea blend that might mollify some of the negative effects of disso abuse, like frequent uti's. Not sure where to post it though and don't want to be thought of as giving medical advice. It's just that it takes years of study to even begin to scratch the surface of understanding the organ systems in the body and how to keep them healthy; even more study to understand which herbs to use and when and why, and I am worried about long term toll on all these crazy motherfuckers binging on novel dissos (myself included). Obviously drinking tea won't magically prevent illness from mashing one's body and mind, but the detoxifying and tonifying properties of certain herbs could be reallyyyy helpful here.

It seemed to be more of an antiviral rather than an antibiotic...from what I read of the original study.


I used for a month and was living pretty unhealthily.  I didn't get sick...not even a cold.  Or a cold sore.  Or even a zit. 


So who knows.  The study wasn't very thorough or convincing.   I wouldn't put much weight on it.

I was having a weird bladder pressure after using o pce. Which then started happening on 3 meo pcp. Strangely no real issues with mxe or k(although i am not using grams on grams of this)


I think I have had undiagnosed/weird uti issues for like 15 years tho. Doctors always say it aint shit and here eat these antibiotics... quit going to them years ago.


Recently i started taking olive leaf extract. It was pretty brutal. Felt like it was destroying some caked upon layers of bacteria and releasing them into my body. I would take activated charcoal as well, wich helped to mitogate these symptoms. It seemed to really fuck with my digestive system though. I cycled taking them for a week or two, then a week or two off with a few days fasting/intestinal flushing. 


Seems to havr made a marked difference. I will probably start another cycle soon.


Fuck these doctors Nd their antibiotics. There are many other ways to cure utis and their ilk.

If you are after stimulant effects just stick to 3-MeO-PCP. This one is not suited for that. Snorted high is lackluster.

40mg sublingual followed by 10mg intranasal left me with a neverending trip with countless of thought loops. Note to self, I will never go over 35-40mg again. I couldn't even close my eyes, it was extremely weird. (You know that feeling "I will stay like this forever") I had to take 2x etizolam to sleep. It's weird because the same ROA but with 30 + 10 previous week was really comfortable, not stimulating at all and I slept without any effort. 10mg made a big difference.

I experienced some bad after effects last weekend.

I ingested 8 mg  orally on saturday evening. This was my second time with O-PCE and  everything went as with my first time two weeks before (10 mg): Nice  dissociative high and that special, long lasting silence in my head at  the comedown which I also like a lot about 3-Meo-PCP.

Slept for 7h and next morning I got up feeling quite  refreshed. After half an hour I suddenly started vomitting and from then  on the whole morning and afternoon every hour. The weird thing is that I  wasn't nauseous at all. I was feeling quite ok physically and mentally  just not the 10 seconds before my next run to the toilet.

Has anyone experienced that?

Found this interesting, but nothing on ketamine and that's all it seems to be a replacement for. Much more amnesia and really felt like key parts that made it recreational are missing. Also much more nausea, was forced to lie down. 


This has had no interaction with the tolerance of 3-meo-pce or ketamine however if anyone is interested to hear.

Sounds awful. Thanks for the warning. I totally regret getting this shit. Usually I never fall for hypes.

Well that is weird. I didn't even have the slightest neusea on 50mg. Are you sure it is drug related? Considering you ingested a small amount without having any bad reaction during the trip or sleep.

 I'm having awesome effects without nausea or body load at 30-40mg without problems. Batch is pure, Energy Control says... maybe your o-PCE is not o-PCE?

About these nasty effects... I am almost convinced there is one batch around containing some kind of impurities. So is mine, purchased from an European source already closed. That is the reason I am not using this substance anymore. It was too caustic in my mouth (I got a couple ulcers from just a 10 mg. dose) and the next day after effects were more a hangover than an afterglow.

 When I have some time, I will do an acetone wash of my stuff and see if this makes it better.

I have no lab -test of my substance. All I can say is it's a highly potent dissociative (that tastes foul ![:p](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)). The O-PCE two weeks before was taken in two steps of 5 mg three hours apart. Still this time's 8 mg felt way heavier.

But you're right, maybe there was somthing else going on with me physically that made me puke my guts out. Maybe not. 

Still I'm kind of conditioned by that experience now and will stay with 3-Meo-PCP from now.

 well if you're experiencing effects at 8mg batch should be really pure, maybe impurities from synth or something? Or, as we all know, every body and mind is different and what is transparent in my body can be a body load on your case ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png) 


BTW I'm with you at all. I fell in love with o-PCE on first trial, and thought it would be my next MXE, but it turned out I'm doing 3-MeO-PCP quite often and can't remember the last time I wanted to dose o-PCE. I use it as a potentiator for psychedelic trips, but on his own, for me, it lacks something ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)

I am still loving it for adding in. I don't regret getting it, it just loses a lot after awhile. 


Last time I took it on its own I saw a show, it worked as well as alcohol... but that says something about it. 


I never really experienced neasua or vomiting much, at least that I would attribute to the drug. my doses went from small to quite large but everyone reacts differently.

I really like this one too actually. If I don't go above 40, everything is perfect. But over that point and also doing a redose kind a ruins it for me.

I abused the stuff too much and I'm in fear for my health, anyone found some toxicity from this compound ? 

I used it almost every night for 2 weeks, high dose (50 to 100mg each time, 2 or 3 25mg or more redose each time), I attained 3 or 4 time the hole (yesterday I got basically unconscious). 2 time in the two weak I feel somewhat bad and all fucked up from this compound sometime even fearing for my life (not sure if the fear was valid thought). Other was good trip.

I'm often hangover the day after, meaning I'm almost always hangover since 2 weeks. It should pass isn't it ? Any experience from regular/high doses ?

I've no more I stop use of it now.

I'm working in some "intellectual" fields and I'm in fear of becoming idiot lol I'm serious


About the product itself at the beginning I didn't really like it, but with more XP I found it's a good compound. Not as good as MXE but great.

After my month long trial I had that crispy burnt out feeling for a good (or bad in my case) week. Kinda reminded me of doing PCP daily, you're left feeling a little mad (for a week) haha. I noticed that I've bounced back after ending the trials and now I can take it randomly, and not consecutive days without ill-effects. Again, this isn't advice, it's just my experience.


There appears two be more than one batch going around though. My batch/supplier never have given my problems but I'm reading more reports of what sounds like a new batch came out and is more likely to cause skin irritation, neasua and "eye pressure issues" (pain w/ fuzzy vision). I can't say for certain but if there is a dirty batch then it could be anything.

So it seems to be common sense, that snorting this is a waste.


What would be a low oral dose for functionally using this substance as a creative catalyst ? If that is not the use case of this substance, what is it good for (there seem to be people, that use it regularly, so it must have advantages) ? Thanks for opinions.

Alcohol substitute, Euphoric Stimulant, anti-anxiety, and adding a hole to a psychedelic. Depending on dose.

Much more euphoric. Much more euphoric than PCP and ketamine as well (both of which I've respectively smoked and shot 100s of times). Ephenidine was even more euphoric though, but I've only done it a few times due to it being so har to get into solution for injection. MXE I've done around 50 times, up to 200mg per shot IV. Nowhere near this one, besides I find keetamine much cozier and more euphoric.


But then again I am weird like that, I find oral tramadol a shit ton more euphoric than IV morphine of which I've done some pretty heroic doses. The only opiate (eventhough tramadol really isn't one) that matches tramadol's euphoria is IV hydromorphone for me. I'm odd I suppose. Hmmm, I may just go and shoot some dilaudid tonight. :D

I can see how he's saying that

The only thing I don't like about o-pce is that in myself there is a kind of bad body load (didn't thought it was possible for dissos...).

Aside that I find a great euphoria in it wich don't even diminish that much with tolerance. The hole is pretty awesome too.

After reading through this thread I've seen some users mention o-PCE's caustic effects or at least perhaps the caustic effects of an impure batch. I am not sure if it's because I was using o-PCE too much and the rumors of it having antibiotic properties are true or that the batch I had was indeed impure but after a week or two of regular use (mostly daily or every other day) I indeed noticed some negative effects, namely sores in my mouth and an overall increased sensitivity of my soft tissue. Also I had some bladder retention and slight stomach pains here and there which I will attribute to the same properties of other dissociatives such as K and MXE, etc. What concerned me was the skin sensitivity in particular and I have since stopped all use of this compound. I am also unsure whether the mouth sores were caused by the o-PCE itself or rather I injured my mouth because of its anesthetic properties which seem to make my lips numb and senseless. Regardless, the sores seemed to take longer to heal than other mouth injuries I've had in my life. It could be that, because of my frequent use, I was feeling a bit paranoid in general but I am worried about this compound's possible antibiotic properties which led me to wonder if the delayed healing was due to immune system suppression or something to that effect.Sorry if this was rambling but I figured someone might be able to weigh in on it or would at least appreciate my input.

I got the bladder effects, but that's all dissociatives for me. I only got a wierd itchy thing on my hand for a day and combining it with 3-meo-pce but I could have brushed against a plant or something. I haven't found this chemical to be caustic at all. This seems to be supporting evidence of multiple batches going around....

Aphthous sores?


Seems like wrong reasoning that antibiotic properties have something to do with immune response just because the immune system fights bacteria etc which antibiotics also happen to target. But plenty of drugs are immunosuppressant like opioids, benzo's... and for a drug like ketamine there are also mechanisms by which it can be immunosuppressant: [https://www.researchgate.net/profil...uppression/links/0deec537cd6d31569a000000.pdf](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ruei-Ming_Chen/publication/235404895_Mechanisms_of_ketamine-induced_immunosuppression/links/0deec537cd6d31569a000000.pdf)


So yes it may very well be linked to your drug use, but no the antibiotic thing probably doesn't have anything to do with this. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


I don't know about the skin sensitivity... dissociatives like these do affect pain-perception and proprioception, I can't say what kind of a rebound can be expected from having such sensations numbed for a while and then discontinuing.

Now that it has been about a week since my last use I am beginning to wonder about the antibiotic thing. Admittedly, I did not read up about the antibiotic question in depth and the thought of it just made me paranoid. I feel fine 6 days out and I think that most of the nasty side effects and immune suppression were simply due to being stimulated and getting poor sleep for so long.


However, the caustic side effects are something I am still a bit concerned about and am curious if it is related to different batches' purity. One other user reported extreme skin sensitivity, redness, and pain around his joints, hands, and ears. That user went on an extreme binge of like 2-4 grams in a week's time, though.

The residual stimulation from o-pce is long and torturous. Leaves one with an inability to sleep and an apparent immunity to the usual downers. It doesn't leave as in "leave the body alone to resume normal functions" but rather "let's see if you still like me 6 hours from now, bitch!"

The things I've found to help were Gabapentin(Muscle and Heart Stim)+Klonipin(Mental Stim) or Mirtazapine (Both). I smoke weed the entire comedown. Not saying these are safe, just what worked for me.

@ MSK, Marauder


What are the doses and ROA, on which you experience this pronounced long-term stimulation ? I can imagine, that it would not be as stimulating for me, because at the moment I take stimulants too regularly.

I usually take 20-25mg oral, and I must be honest, I don't feel it really stimullating at that dosage and ROA. I usually combine some beers and cannabis into the experience, and after 4-5h I usually can sleep without the need of a benzo or GBL, like with 3-MeO-PCP whatever ROA I use. 


Snorting it, though, whatever the dosage and even if I don't redose, feels stimulating and lackluster, not the best ROA in my experience. The few times I tried snorted I needed some benzos or GBL to be able to sleep, and the effects weren't anything remarkable that I would want to experiment again.


25mg Oral + 1-2 beers + 1-2 joints + some tryptamine at +3h is my prefered way to take this one :D

What dose would you suggest to someone without any prior disso experience? 

Is 10mg to low to experience dissociative effects? I don't wanna get overwhelmed, a basic

understanding of what I am messing around with would be enough for my first time!


[This is what it looks like](http://i.imgur.com/PQ7jwMO.jpg): I assume I need to crush all the crystals first, I don't really wanna volumetric dose it though. Do you think

it's good enough to place something like 100mg on my scale (0.001g) and then remove the o-pce till the scale displays 0.090g? 

Would that be an accurate measurement (I know most scales have difficulties measuring out small amounts like sub 20mg).


Upon researching, I think I'll go for 12mg orally. That should give me a good impression, of what dissos are about!


//edit: I went with the 3-meo-pcp instead, around 10mg in a cap.

Thanks. Sounds like 3-meo-pce then (and 3-meo-pcp), regarding the qualitative differences between ROAs. I must admit, that, although orally 3-meo-pce feels a lot more recreational (basically it is instant holiday feeling, independent of actual stress level), I like it also as a stimulant, perhaps even more. I suppose, that my preferred ROA with 2-oxo-pce will be snorted as usual ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

Measure the weight of the item in question and write it down for future reference. Add your material to the bowl and weight it again. Subtract the weight of the bowl from the weight of the bowl + material. Remember to use the tare function or on/off function between each measurement and also to calibrate your scale every now and then.

Volumetric dosing anyone? Take a known amount of material (dividing a known amount by 2/4/8 etc. works well enough imho), dissolve in water which leaves the substance evenly distributed in the liquid. Then split the liquid volemetrically as needed (with a syringe). E.g. 500mg / 10ml water would equal 10mg per .2ml water or 20units in an insuline syringe. You can either use that solution orally, intravenously, rectally or via a nasal spray once you know how much liquid you get per push (not very accurate). Alternatively you dry the liquid on an even surface and scrape it up for intranasal use. Drying, say 80mg and splitting the powder into halves would also work. 80->40->20->10mg... Accurate enough imho.

Rather uneventful. There are always those holes where nothing big ever happens. I IV'ed this at 25mg, IM'ed it at 50mg and 100mg, really nothing worth talking about. It was very euphoic the first time I tried t and it was still very euphoric these last times, but not much in terms of psychedelia I'm afraid. I still value the substance highly, see my report: 

[2-Oxo-PCE - 100mg IM - Beyond experienced - Time for a Timeout](https://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads/795566-2-Oxo-PCE-100mg-IM-Beyond-eperienced-Time-for-a-Timeout)


A massive decrease in tolerance to pot, booze and stimulants was observed in the following the days.

Aren't such high doses of NDMA-antagonists considered to be neurotoxic ? It is a legit question, as I am not sure, under which circumstances those substances become neurotoxic.

Probably. I personally do not care, since I've been doing this for a long time and my cognitive functions are still intact. The way I see it - Be prepared to lose a few cells here and there. Except for a few episodes I haven't been using ketamine, pcp or other dissociatives on a daily basis, so I've never seen it as a threat to my health.


NMDA antagonists are neuroprotective up to a certain dosage level and I don't even consider my dosage that high. It was definitely subanaesthetic.

I think the PCP derivates are neurotoxic. The piperidine cannot be easy metabolized like ordinary alkylamines. And in addtion a metabolite of ketamine (3-hydroxy-norketamine or something like that :D ) is active on AMPA-receptors. This leads to nerve cell growing or at least some activated neuroplasticity. In professional research NMDA-antagonist MK-801 is used for protection of neurone cells against glutaminergic over stimulation. I am going to a MRT next month, we will see if a have olney-liasions :D

I have been iving 20-30mg o pce and I absolutely love it is so absolutely euphoric. It's my first experience with ACHs apart from k I suppose. Tolerance does raise quite fast but it is such an enlightening and enjoyable experience every single time. Gone through a gram so far last few weeks no negative side effects so to speak

What is all that stuff about 2-Oxo-PCE being stimulating? Knocks me flat on my ass and transitions me smoothly to sleep towards the end. I'll IV 50mg later today and then 50mg IM, let's see how that goes. I hope it's not as dull as it has been the last few times. I also tried 2F-Ketamine the other day and was absolutely amazed, almost as good as ephenidine and surely better than racemic ketamine (the s isomer being shit).


Btw since someone asked, my mood has been in perfect balance the since my last 2-Oxo-PCE dose.

I'll IV 50mg later today and then 50mg IM, let's see how that goes. I hope it's not as dull as it has been the last few times. I also tried 2F-Ketamine the other day and was absolutely amazed, almost as good as ephenidine and surely better than racemic ketamine (the s isomer being shit).

Yesterday, with medium/nearly high tolerance I took 30mg oral of this at 6:30p.m. plus a few lines of 2-OxO-PCM (I can go up 50mg lines without really feeling it too much), and I was able to sleep without benzos at 1a.m. with just some cannabis and two beers. I only feel this one stimulating when snorted. And not stimulating in a 3-MeO-PCP or dopaminergic (cocaine, amphetamine) sense, but just beeing awake and finding hard to sleep.

Ok well. I kinda get what people may mean I suppose. I had a bit of a hard time falling asleep myself last night, despite the whopping dose of this chemical in my blood. Maybe it was just my anxiety about that damn 30 liter fishtank I brought to it's knees if I was even aware of it at the time. Worst. Dissociative Experience. Ever. How I am still alive is beyond me. One of those very few stories that I will not even share with my closest friends for now. A story I just can't tell because it'd bring such shame upon those involved for not leaving a stupid motherfucker like me to rot.


Godamn I wish I could write a report about this. Wild. So fucking wild.


But first I wll take care of the water. Oh the damage.

I'm feeling the urge to write up my most recent experience.: As you probably read earlier, I am new to the whole disso world. I've never gotten my hands on MXE nor any other dissociative substance. I went ahead and got my hands on both 3-meo-pcp and o-pce. 2 Days ago I took a small dose of o-pce, which was around 7mg (insufflated). Nothing special happened, other than some warmth and music appreciation. 


Today I insufflated 20mg of o-pce, I want to add that I just broke my right feet, which requires me to lay in my bed. This is why I thought o-pce was a good idea... and I was right. Again, I have no prior disso experience so my words probably sound kinda virgin to you. My head started to feel kinda heavy and I was feeling like my legs where floating, even though I didn't move them at all... This was quite enjoyable, even though it actually scared me, because I thought there was something wrong with my limbs (it felt like they where cut off from my body). My arms looked different, it looked like they where a lot longer, can anyone relate to that? 


A warm feeling was taking over my whole body, but at the same time I felt super drunk. I had double vision and everything was kinda spinning, I didn't really like that but I assume it's part of the disso experience... When I closed my eyes I felt like I was on another planet, the music sounded amazing ([this is what I listened to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1vOGSG4Og0&list=LLzh92B8UK4IVjIuU-S1hZMg&index=9)). I've never heard music like this before, not even LSD or MDMA came close to that. I didn't really enjoy rap though, idk why. But the music I linked was awesome as fuck... I had some crazy CEV, I was running through a tunnel or space, I can't put it into words... It was just me, the universe and the music. nothing else. I've never felt anything like that before.


Honestly, I feel kinda "dumb" now (it feels like my IQ got divided by 2 and I am acting kinda slow), I took the o-pce around 5h ago, is this part of the afterglow? When I am turning my head, my brain needs quite some time to process what it's seeing. Has anyone else ever experienced something like this? I guess, this is what a retard must feel like. Not trying to offend anyone, just writing up my thoughts... don't get me wrong. I just took some 4f-mph to combat the negative effects, hopefully reaching baseline soon again. 


I would be happy if anybody took some time to answer, because I am quite overwhelmed. 


Also: Cr00k, I love reading your posts; I know it's OT but isn't today the day, where the new German blanket ban becomes legally valid? I am not familiar with bluelights rules, feel free to delete this but Germany is definitely taking a big step into the wrong direction... people will just go back to meth/speed and shit like that instead of all the banned rc's... /rant over

The feeling slow and visual processing delays are relatively normal with diss' use. Careful combing stimulants and Eticyclidone as it can be very speedy and hypo/manic. I usually felt "normal" about 24 hours after my last dose. Usually after a little sleep. Stay safe; sounds like you had a good time :D

I second that. Dissociatives can potentiate and prolong the effects of stimulants significantly for me. You are also bound to do stupid stuff like running over streets stuffed with cars or spilling 30L fishing tanks and the like lol.


I went to my old place today to take care of the mess. That apartment is full of furniture and cartons leaning against the walls and standing in the way with little space left to move. The mattress I laid out on the floor to sleep on actually soaked up roughly 20L. Looks like the water damage won't cost me thousands of euros after all. The place still like a fucking tornado went ballistic in there. I also found several empty syringes, placing my dose somewhere in the 200mg range. Judging by the state of my arms I tried to IV more than the initial 50mg dose, but ended up IM'ing them judging by the pain inside my muscles. it I'm still slightly impaired 25 hours later (100mg IM had me alive and kicking after 10h or so, see report). 


I remember it got so bad I didn't know who I was anymore and all the things I saw were someone else's things. I've been to that place many times and it has never been pretty. I have no idea why I still have such an insatiable desire for dissociatives. I've shot any substance I could get to dissolve in water or propylene glyycol after getting my hands on them and while I should really not have survived some episodes or events, I can usually produce the desired effects relatively reliably, but the class of drug that makes me feel the worst I've ever felt in my life on more than half the 'occasions' I use them has me on my knees begging for more (to be fair no drug ever really seems to make me feel how I want to feel when deciding to take them, not in the way I seem to remember to have felt on it before). 


EDIT: Godd I keep skipping words when typing up these posts, having to go through them more than twice until I've spotted such mistakes eventhough its been over 40 hours since I shot those 200mg. I can't remember it ever having been this bad even after the most brutal sessions. Must be a problem associated with this substance in particular if you ask me.


I decided I would not use dissociatives anymore several times within these 2 weeks since my last break of several months ended and probably a hundred times in the decade before that, but as little as a day or two after I made those decisions I see myself receiving 3 letters and shooting those little devils every free moment I get, cancelling all appointments and declining all offers to socialize, even on days I've got really important shit to do (except for the three days per week I care for my daughter on). It's been 12 years since I discovered ketamine and pcp and while both substances and their analogues allowed me to have some beautiful and absolutely mind blowing experiences, there are few things for me that are harder to understand than said unsatiable desire. 


Why could it be attractive to lose control over all motor skills and completely lose any sense of identity, all dominated by complete and utter bewilderment and alienation for the nightmare one is moving through? How in fuck's name could that be possible?! I've pondered this question a lot and will surely never find a single ultimate answer to it. 


All I can say to those who think they've found the magic cure for all their problems during the honeymoon phase of their use is to be aware of how dark a road you could find yourself walking down, a road devoid of any goals or sense of purpose, chasing after that mystical experience you once cherished so much. I'm still grateful these substances exist since they pulled me out of depressed states more than once, being bipolar and unable to use monoaminergic reuptake inhibitors for that purpose, but more times than not they plain opened the gates to hell and made death of accidental self injury a very acute and real theat.

Thank you for those words, it really means something to me. It is that day. I know customs has systematically been keeping letters sent through certain channels to keep them until this day. I have however dialed dozens of phone numbers until I found one not supposed to be called by "customers" (lol) in order to distance myself from the one last letter of mine they still have in their possession (it contained a 2-phenylethylamine which are now all banned preemptively along with cannabinoids). I can't say I am entirely unhappy about the ban eventhough I agree it's a step in the wrong direction. Possession of small amounts is still unproblematic, but sale will be pursued vigorously I suppose.

 i feel you bro, I also find myself breaking promises of sparing my usage, beeing aware how bad to my life, mind and body is binging on this sfuff. Dissos are one of the most addictive substances I've ever tried, and I did all kinds of benzos, opiates and stims. I will happily pass the rest of my life without trying meth, alprazolam or heroin again. But don't touch my dissos! The scape of reality they provide is not compared to anything

Vey true. That is the sad reality, as much as the devil in us tries to deny it (also something I don't personally see with other drugs). The craziest part is that I've barely recovered from those 200mg and already find myself craving again. Wtf?!

Since the MXE drought (I've not made an effort to ferret out any extant sources) I've used dissociatives less, though a few times I've found myself falling back into frequent, MXE-like usage, with 2-Oxo-PCE (O-PCE). 


I've never used any other class of drug so frequently (and I've been around the block), which is strange since dissociatives don't appear to be physically addictive. The explanation for this that I've made for myself is that I don't perceive any short-tern drawbacks to use of MXE or 2-Oxo-PCE. I have next day hangovers from cannabis, with short term memory issues extending for up to three days after heavy use -- and that's friendly old cannabis!  I'm fine the next day after my typical light to moderate dosages of the said dissociatives. People can't typically tell I'm on them either, unlike cannabis or alcohol. 


The problem is, in the long term, I don't want to be a person who is frequently inebriated, but the human mind evolved in environments where the long term future was highly unpredictable. Therefore, it pays lip service to the future but doesn't really "feel" in the moment like it's of that much consequence. However, in the modern world where you need to create your persona and persevere for years to achieve most interesting things in life it's usually important to stay sober and focused for long periods of time. You can't be taking mental vacations frequently because that makes the mild sober motivation to achieve long term goals seem insufficient, if not entirely unperceivable.

Not really sure what to make of it


It is similar to MXE but for sure is it's own creature 


Not really sure on duration and dosing either....I guess I should get my scales out and stop eyeballing 


Oral and nasal really feel quite similar

With regard to long lasting stimulation, dose doesn't seem to matter, subjectively anyway. If I feel the dissociative effects, I'm left unable to nap or sleep for a good 3-5 hours afterward. Preferred ROA is vaping the freebase (o-pce+baking soda+tiny bit of water+heat) but this also applies to insufflation. The stimulation from this shouldn't be confused with mania or euphoria. It's more a nuisance. As if one were wearing nicotine patches and drinking coffee while attempting to sleep.

Ive found that my fitness lifestyle keeps my dissio use under control.

I suspect that the reconecting with my body every time i hit the gym makes it less worth it to get high and disconected from reality to often.


The better i feel in my body sober the better the hole will feel once i choose to plunge in.

But the important part is that i make the choice to get high instead of the drug controling me.


But honestly i know i cant have dissios around so i only buy whatever amount i want to use in a couple of days at a time.

Hi, I thought I want to share my experience so far. 


I take ~ 20-30mg per week, especially on the weekend so I can keep my head clear during the week at work. 20-30mg at once is much for me, somehow I do not really exceed my tolerance over this barrier, so I swallow about 7-10mg at friday and 7-10mg twice at saturday. This is a scheme I inherit for about 4-5 Weeks. And by now i think my life has improved. My alcohol abuse is somehow blown away. 1-2 beer is enough on a friday afternoon. And I drink much slower than before.  My urge to smoke wheed is completely lost, because I want to do things and I can't while i am on wheed :D mostly because of lazyness^^ 

I still have my problems with depression and altered perception of social interaction, but i think i am on the right way with this stuff in low doses at the weekends. Maybe some of you wanted to hear... 


Anyhow, the discussion about antibiotic properties clearly has to end. I read it from time to time, and here are some of my thoughts on it. Spread the word :D 

 It is NOT a antibiotic against bacteria. Not in our range. Maybe at very high doses ( 500mg ? ), but that is not worth a try. Not at all, because intolerant people die at 100-150mg. If you read the patent on 2-oxo-pcm, you will only read, that the feeling/condition/status of the patients with VIRUS infections like herpes zoster improved. Maybe because it is a psycho-active? The parameters are not cleared out on this.  


About the addiction potential: yes, it is there. But I think it is not addictive as alcohol or other stuff. It is more a dependency. I can only speak for myself, i really need it. But i don't need much of it, and I am not addicted to it and it's not that i try to search some deeper truths in the dissociation or somewhat. From my point of view I am currently medicating myself on experimental anti-depressant. It is working somehow, but still risky. I will report more later on, by now i am somehow happy with my situation.  Greetings! ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I find it to be mentally addictive as MXE was. I am not sure about physical addiction. After the month I was groggy and other little things but I didn't feel like it was a harsh w/d or comedown except mentally desiring to do it again. 


I also don't drink, and have the time to play with it a good amount at the moment. I feel like if I was still drinking, I would use it as a replacement; like I did with MXE.

This substance does neither fit into the "recreational", nor the "functional" category for me.


I'm not sure, whether it is poison or medicine. ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

well yeah, this is the interesting part. 2 Monts ago i was on 10mg every day for a week,but i found that simply too much. And for now i think o-pce is a stake in my life, from which i can grow out and live without afterwards hopefully. What do you think crook?

I am really interested, what your goal was by ingesting it every day. I orally took 9mg today and one hour later I felt like having injected a few shots of Vodka for a little period, while my thinking was not impaired the slightest. I'm not sure, yet, whether it was influenced at all.


The main effect of this substance is motoric impairment, the after effects include mild (not annoying) stimulation. I cannot comprehend, how this drug can be utilized (yet).

On reading your other posts, it is likely you habe tolerance to a certain aspect of the drug. I think most the larger dose and long term users would agree it is far better when mixed with a tryptamines or lysergamide, I wonder if you are tolerant to like SERT effects or something. That's all speculation but I find it odd that you seem to have such an unpleasant experience with this one. 


Also, I consider this first and foremost a "holing" drug. If you aren't looking for a hole, or if you use this one nasally, it is kind of useless.

This drug can be taken on higher doses for a hardcore hole I'm not able to achieve with K or MXE. Also, combining it with psychedelics is one of my favourite current drug experiences, insane visuals, awaken lucid dreaming and ego loss.


By itself and at low/normal doses, for me it's what you describe. Motor impairment, dizziness, not a lot going on the mind... Don't worth taking it. Cannabis seem to add some magic to the experience as well.

@StMorningGlory


I get good effects from low doses (2-5mg) of 3-MeO-PCP (functional pleasent effects) and low/medium doses (5-15mg) of 3-MeO-PCE (recreational pleasant effects). While it is likely, that I have a certain tolerance to stimulants, I doubt that it has anything to do with serotonine transporters.


I also got subpar effects from this months ago, when I did not have a high stimulant tolerance and zero disso tolerance (disso tolerance should still be low from once a week medium dose use).


But thanks for your food for thought. I never aimed for a hole. I used MXP as a "medicine" and 3-MeO-PCP as a util and 3-MeO-PCE for recreation. Holing is not on my todo-list (,yet).


@ MSK


Thanks for the confirmation. It seems to be a combo-drug. Not suitable for me then I guess. It is not utter rubbish. It is just the least useful dissociative I have taken, yet. And as I wrote, I am not sure, whether it is a medicine, i.e. having preferable after effects, while the onset is unpleasant or (mild) poison, i.e. having undesirable after effects overall.

For taking with no-holing purposes, and as mood lifter or pain reliever, 3-MeO-PCP or 2-OxO-PCM would be my choices. 3-MeO-PCP for stimulating mania, 2-OxO-PCM for sedating numb.

Until now I must conclude, that it has preferable short/middleterm after effects. So I'm leaning more towards "medicinal" applicableness of this compound, while the onset effects are neutral/weird for me.

Ingested 2-4 mg (tiny eyeballed dose) orally today and it works suprisingly well in accordance with the intention of inducing a mild dissociated mind state without the physical impairment and exuberant euphoria. There is still hope for this compound. :D

Oh yes I am. I remember thinking the same thing for months. Shit I even tried to use ketamine as an antidepressant after years of use. Now there is no class of drugs (except for cannabis) that I am more addicted to. The costs and risks I've taken to use dissociatives are absolutely shocking to my non-fiending self.


I've seen this happen to many others eventhough I've seen more people who were perfectly fine with their recreational use. For those doing them on a regular basis that ratio seems to shift towards the former group though. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


One thing I would recommend is keeping of your use in a calendar, especially if you are seriously using dissociatives on a regular basis regardless of whether it's intended as self medication or as a recreational thing. Try to find rules for your maximum frequency of use and minimum distance between doses. Then try to stick to those rules be astounded by the ability of your brain to rationalize breaking them. :D

So easy to break self impossed rules about disso use for me... The only thing that works for me is, once I realize I started a binge and that I won't be able to control my use at all (Because once I start to hit it hardcore and daily, I'm not able to stop!) is to give my flatmate my disso stash and tell him not to give it back to me until 2-4 weeks. 


You see, I need to have two different stash boxes: one for all my dissos, one for all the other drugs (Opiates, stimulants, psychedelics, benzos, GBL...) I can live without touching any of the non-dissociative drugs easily. I'm not able to control my use with any kind of disso ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)


So stay safe, everyone has got his poison. You may think you are controlling it using it once weekly, but before you could realize you would be upping dosages, and doing it daily, justifying yourself because of taking it as a "therapeutic compound".

The only thing that works for me is, once I realize I started a binge and that I won't be able to control my use at all (Because once I start to hit it hardcore and daily, I'm not able to stop!) is to give my flatmate my disso stash and tell him not to give it back to me until 2-4 weeks.

I hear you!! I feel there is not enough information out there about the absolutly insane addictive potential that this vclas of drugs poses for some (!) of us. Ironically I never used much aside from psychedelics and cannabis when I was introduced to ketamine as another distinctively different type of psychedelic called a dissociatve. 


That's why I thought of it as my personal gateway to 'hard drugs'. However I've come to realize it wouldn't get any more problematic than abusing  dissociatives. They were also what got me started on needles.


I suppose they aren't objectively more addictive than opiates or stimulants, but fuck me if they aren't in my case.


EDIT: These threads clearly belong to the other drugs section. That's that place where people die for those unaware of it.

Well shit CrOOk that is dark. 


Opiates were actually my gateway to dissos (I tried k and DXM a few times between 2000-2009 and it didnt do much for me), a stepping down in 'hardness' as I discovered they were more therapeutic, recreational and cost-effective compared to the opiate-life which was in fact a place where I would have died without the spiritual thirst-quenching effect MXE (and K to a degree) impressed on me, and I chose life.

Re: making a calendar for use, during my most effective periods of use I stuck pretty well to a calendar, at first non-intentionally, it was circumstantial as much as it was my intuition helping me. I always found myself having really strong peak experiences on Full Moon nights., and when the moon was new I was likely to be in an abstinence period. So if You break down 28 days into a recurrent cycle, there are lots of ways to do it, some I detail in my book in the 'yin-yang dosing' section, but for instance you could do 2 or 2 and a half days a week, keeping it to the weekends. You could do more consistent dosing for 5 days in a row (if daytime, lower doses, if evening then higher doses but watch for the long stimulant tail with Eticyclidone), and then a 9 day abstinent period. Just some examples, and everyone will be different with their unique intentions and balancing techniques.

I wish the same was true for me. Like I said none of these classes of drugs are objectively more addictive than the others. I am glad they were a lifesaver for you. Me I am just perplexed they haven't cost me mine yet. You just never know what's gonna happen when you start to use a drug.

So no goals. All right, then.


Didn't know, that academic studies can be finished, ever. :D


In my view, this substance is the perfect pure dissociation device without noticable side effects (euphoria, sedation, stimulation) in the onset, after the comeup is over. Of cource the after effects are stimulating but this goes with every dissociative I've tried.

Maybe I should better say i made my pharmacist's degree.... turned my hobby into my profession :D 

Anyway, i find the onset kind of annoying by now.....it creates a trip none the less and also a speaking, thinking and moving impairment comes with it. For leaving reality it can be nice, but if you don't want to it is just a interesting side effect, in which you can't be productive or social...

I consumed about 13mg of o-pce last night and had terrible nausea and barfed a few times over the night. I ended up taking an etizolam to just relax and lay in bed until I fell asleep after a few hours of the drug wearing off. My partner took two doses of 16mg spaced 5 hours apart with zero negative reactions. I am wondering why I had such an adverse reaction this time. I've tried this drug twice before with great results but this time was way different and I still feel off this morning. I did not mix with any drugs except drank one beer at dinner a few hours before ingesting the o-pce so maybe alcohol had a weird reaction to my body chemistry? It's really frustrating because my bad reaction last night has turned me off to testing this one ever again. I think i'll just stick to my stash of MXE from now on... Anyone else get sick from this stuff?

I'm not sure, but I remember in the MXE days, we'd occasionally have trips that just weren't the same, quite jarring or unpleasant.  Dissociatives are tricky beasts.

Exactly my thoughts. This compound cannot be utilized as well as other dissos. It feels like your life turns into an first person RPG game (without weapons in my case) and everyone you meet is an NPC and most of the time I am overwhelmed by the dialogue choices, because I cannot get any pleasure from conversations and nothing does really matter. Until now I am not sure, whether it is not slightly useful as utility for concentration in ultra low doses.

I only took 9mg orally (my highest oral dose) and also felt incredibly sick during the comeup. Did not have to vomit, but it was close, and I rarely get sick. I have to add, that I was not in the best physical condition beforehand (had diarrhea but without nausea), at all. Did not have physical side effects via nasal ROA.

I drank a redbull beforehand and those drinks have 2-3x daily vitamin B so maybe thats why I got so sick? Next time I will have to be totally clean from everything even vitamins I suppose. My partner loves the chem though it is definitely a gem.

I do, too! But not at all with 3-MeO-PCP, and MXE also was fine with a few drinks for the most part from what I remember. Not exactly sure what's up with that.

But I'm betting that for example deschloroketamine / O-PCM is terrible with alcohol - Not sure about O-PCE because it is harder to imagine for me than O-PCM, but whatever it is, I think it is also the correlate of the physical anaesthetic component. Not all dissociatives are big on that.

Would you agree?

Well you could be right. I'm ok combining alcohol with dissociatives these days, but that used to be different during the firsts few years. I don't get dizzy or nauseous on O-PCE, but it fucks my motor skills worse than any other dissociative lol.

When my partner drank before taking it, she puked during the trip. When she drank after consuming the Eticyclidone, she found it to be slightly more euphoric with no vomiting.

I've had a few experiences with this drug now and it's really weird for me. I have no prior experience with dissociatives, no K and no MXE.

I've gotten myself a gram of 3-meo-pcp and .5g of o-pce. I have no real disso tolerance, I limit myself to one trip a week. I've always 

liked the upper scale doses of the dissos, sometimes 15mg 3-meo-pcp or 12mg o-pce (insufflated) haven't gotten me any effects. That's why

I am only going to orally consume those drugs from now on. It takes my body around 1.5-2h to feel any effects from o-pce, which makes me wonder

if some individuals show poor interaction with certain drugs. My sweetspot with o-pce has been around 20mg+, I usually put on some headphones and

hop into my bed and experience some journey. I don't know a lot about dissociatives at all, neither about holes. But I usually notice that there is nothing around me,

everything is black and I feel like I am driving around somewhere. Or getting driven, to be accurate. I don't feel like being in a different reality however, or anything like that.

My usual experience goes like this: Ingest the substance -> watch some youtube videos till I feel effects -> put on some nice music -> close my eyes and get driven around.

My vision always starts to get different: Everything looks like I am drunk, I get double vision, when I move my head it takes some time for the vision to change. Most of the times I get kinda

confused, I don't know what I've taken or when I have taken it. The music sounds awesome, I am the music. Is it possible that I am experiencing a hole on those o-pce doses? As I mentioned earlier,

my usual dose is around 20-25mg, everything below just feels nice but not worth the one week break inbetween, I limit myself to. If I am not holing, what dose should I take for a hole on o-pce? 


Is it common not to feel anything? One time I insufflated 15mg of 3-meo-pcp and didn't feel any effects, not even 4h later where I decided to go to sleep.

Tolerance builds quick with dissociatives, but even with tolerance that's not really normal to not feel anything. Remember 3-meo-PCP takes quite a while to come up, but you should still feel it. 


That sounds like the edge if a hole, I get the "driving" feeling usually at just under the hole, and in it. Also, I mean, I don't usually get the "feel like being in a different reality however" from anything expect breakthrough doses of like (5-meo)DMT/Ketamine/DXM.

I took 25-30mg per day each of the last two days. Didnt sleep much last night and had a long drive back into town for work today. Was feeling pretty dead. Decided 5mg o pce (had a PG/o pce solution so dose is accurate) might numb me/give me stimulation around the 2 hour mark. Felt more intoxicated than I had either of the two previous days. Sitting there like "ma n this just made it worse"

> That sounds like the edge if a hole, I get the "driving" feeling usually at just under the hole, and in it. Also, I mean, I don't usually get the "feel like being in a different reality however" from anything expect breakthrough doses of like (5-meo)DMT/Ketamine/DXM.

I was under the impression that dissociatives like o-pce and 3-meo-pcp also provide some breakthrough experience. Apparently I am wrong with that one, I've never felt like this either and assumed I just need to push the dose. Is there anything I can do to fall into the hole faster/more efficient? Can I control my trip?

IV is always more likely to produce a hole but I'm not going to suggest IV, because it's not really harm reduction to suggest needles. 


Breakthrough experiences are different from holing experiences, imo.

Do dissociatives also offer the chance of a breakthrough? Or is it limited to holes? I'm a new to dissos, are there any threads that you suggest to read? I'm really interested!

Breakthrought and holes are totally different experiences, and kind of zenith ones. I love them both.


With 3-meo is next to impossible and quite dangerous to pursue a hole, don´t try that. 3-meo is more to be in the flow. 


To hole, o-pce is, in my opinion, the holy grail, together with k(the father) and mxe (the holy spirit)

So how much o-pce does it take to hole?

Orally - and nasally

With no tolerance

curious too considering the difference in the four holes @Hexagon Sun just mentioned..

maybe its tolerance.. def not ROA but have not hit a 'hole' in the sense mxe or k was but it was definitely more like 3-meo

I found 30mg to be enough to hole with, just dissolve it into a drink and gulp it down, it doesn't even taste as bad but you could just put some flavor in it if you wanted (I really like the "MONIN Grenadine Sirup"). But it's definitely not necesarry ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png) When dissolved in a drink it only takes me around 20 minutes to feel the initial effects, when taken in a capsule it takes 2 hours on average, that's why I prefer dissolving. I feel like o-pce is worthless when snorted, does anyone agree on that one? Orally feels a lot more sedating and a lot more "holey". 


Yesterday I drunk 30mg in a drink and somehow got busy texting people, which was a big mistake. I only texted nonsense, I don't know why I kept texting because I should have just sat back and holed. That was a really weird experience and I feel like I wasted the o-pce this day. Has something like that ever happened to someone? I couldn't even read the shit I was texting, it took me a good 20 seconds for each sentence to read, while typing took even longer. 


I have another experience I wanna share with you guys: Me and a friend both took 20mg (it was his first experience), everything went good but in the end (t+5:00) we both snorted a small amount of 2cb (5mg each) which is considerably low. We where out of our world, we where convinced my whole room wasn't "straight" anymore. My bed was supposed to look like this | | but it looked like / /. Idk if that makes sense but we fucking rearranged my whole room, until we noticed that also the walls and doors where / /, we came to the conclusion that it's either caused by a drug or the house I am living in was built / /. I took a glass of water and put it on the ground to check if the water surface would be _ instead of ~ or /. Fortunately it was even and we just laughed it off and just put the carpet back on (the carpet itself was a little uneven, we both think this greatly contributed to our "uneven reality" We both thought we broke "something" in our reality and had no idea how to fix it. This whole experience felt on the edge of a psychosis, even though we both totally enjoyed that experience, it was sooo fun. We noticed that we made the whole thing even "worse" when talking about it, we got more and more involved into those thoughts when speaking about it. But we kept complaining, because we both wanted to push it. We smoked some weed in the experience, hoping it would calm us down, but it only potentiated everything (both o-pce and 2cb), just as I assumed (and told him before). It was a 10/10 experience though, has anything like that ever happened to somebody? If not I would probably consider taking a break from dissos, because I wouldn't want to be stuck in that mindset, even though (as pointed out numerous times) it was a really nice "trip".


Another general question: I always see you talking about "spiritual holes", have I never holed when I just felt disconnected in a black room/tunnel? I never got other thoughts or stuff like you are talking about, I am pretty sure I got clean product (both o-pce and 3-meo-pcp) but I have little to no experiences with both. A combined 8 trips, if I had to guess. But I am getting more and more interested in pushing the doses. In the beginning I wanted to only have one experience each week, but is it possible for somebody without a tolerance to trip like twice a week, without ruining the magic?

These are addictive chemicals iRavage. You are showing a pattern of abuse, be careful because they are very hard drugs to get off. The "mental vacations" are something that I got more, the more I used it during my month testing. I found less ability to have a meaningful experience, which is what I expected but yes I could get more trips without ruining the magic but it was raised doses and diminished returns. 


From my experience you can only hole through injection of 3-MeO-PCP and injection or oral of O-PCE. Nasal always is more just kinda an euphoric stimulant for both.

this maybe.. but in a cross thread discussion on how taxing the combination can be in general even for the naive or novice, and experienced.

i have i.m. and plugged 100mg of o-pce.. I had holed once, and it was with 3meo at the time, I found habit in spiking 5mg-10mg of 3-meo to any disso

but i feel my body is tolerating it as more of a stimmy sided experience at this point.


-currently have not been using any dissos for a couple weeks. but what i do love is some o-pce/3meo with an hydrocodone .

I'm pretty sure newcomers to the disso world will find it easy to hole on this one. With what I can consider a low tolerance for myself, I had hole experiences with just 25 mg of 2-OxO-PCE and some ganja... Oh boy, I miss those first doses!


For hardcore and experienced drug abusers I can recommend a mix with tryptamine or lysergamide. Fucking amazing transdimensional experiences out of this world I didn't know even could be possible until I found this drug..

This is the truth. This one really seems to show its colors to the newcomers much more than the hardheads. I'm pretty sure I mentioned this before but it seems that the tolerance from this doesn't just make it require more, it also loses its magic. Similar to K and LSD when abused. I didn't find this with 3-meo-pcp/pce, mxe or PCP. 


Once I was mixing lysergamides (my preferred over tryptamines, favorite being ALD-52) then I had some of the most euphoric experiences of my life. My favorite tryptamines so far is 5-meo-DMT but the body load can be overwhelming. 4-ho-met is also very fun but had dark moments. 


I have noticed that there is more of a nostalgic ("long term moreish") factor once I haven't had eticyclidone than the 3-meo's. This reminds me more of MXE and Ketamine in that sense. A just kind of random "Oh man, I wish I was on that right now" here and there; opposed to ending the trip and wanting more immediately. This is definitely an addictive one.

I agree with you, with this one I find it is best to spare usage, or it could easily became boring with binging. On 3-MeO-PCP I don't see that happening, I can repeat and repeat and repeat... Comedown from 3-MeO is longer and harsher, though. I'm still feeling a bit light headed from my last 3-MeO June megabinge and nearly 2 weeks has passed...


I tried this one combined with ETH-LAD, LSD, 4-AcO-DET and 4-HO-MET. All amazing and unique experiences.


I feel 2-Oxo-PCM and 3-MeO-PCP are more addicting for my personality than this stuff. Amazingly, I was able to dodge that "oh man, I wish I was on that right now" bullets better than with the other ones ^^U

That's the way I enjoyed my combos most. First the disso, and 1 or 2 hours later the tryptamine/lysergamide. If I do the opposite I tend to become more confused. This, with the long lasting/stimulating ones like this one or 3-MeO-PCP. With ketamine or 2-OxO-PCM I like the opposite, to dose it at the tail or the end of a full psychedelic experience.

I picked up a gram of this stuff and so far I don't really care for it. 10mg got me wobbly, another 10 a couple hours after that had me confused and then I lost an hour or two after the second redose. Fortunately I was just playing a video game online, and I guess I was still reasonably competent, as the friends I was playing with don't seem to have noticed anything was amiss. Figured I'd shoot straight for the hole the next day. Took 30mg and lay down in the dark with some trance on, definitely holed but don't remember much beyond that.


MXE is the only other dissociative I've tried, and O-PCE feels like its obnoxious kid brother. The dissociation goes from mildly confusing straight to overwhelming, the euphoria isn't there, there's no magic. And the next day I feel hung over, no afterglow, with only scattered and vague memories of the experience. One night on MXE I was completely convinced that the universe was a simulation with quantum behavior being evidence of the limitations of the computer running it, and couldn't decide whether I wanted to give up everything I'd ever known to see the "real" world, or to stay with my familiar happy existence in the simulation. Other times I felt my existence completely merge with the music I was listening to. I don't feel too confident that O-PCE will take me anywhere like that, though I still want to try low doses with cannabis and with psychedelics.

^Have any MXE memorialists tried mixing it with 3-MeO-PCE? MXE is 3'-MeO-2-Oxo-PCE. I'd think that your best shot at making a whole from the parts at the moment -- a convenient and somewhat interesting pharmacological theory to test anyways.

Amazing combo but not even kinda like MXE. I have talked about that combo a few times but that's because I like the good like 10 hour trip that's full of dissociatives properties rather than just holing. Heart rate goes way up when in combo though...  so careful.

3-meo-PCP and 2-oxo-PCE is amazing too, the 3-meo providing the euforia this compound seems to lack. If you are looking for a MXE like experience, though, sorry, only MXE itself can provide that

Yep, that is for sure. Tinnitus has been really bad here and there. The full month on had it grow a lot. This is something I found common with certain stimulants and opiates. 


Wierd thing, benzos seem to help. I have no idea why.

Hey guys! Anyone know long this stuff last for? I had taken around 11pm. And I woke up at 630 (because my crazy brain wants to wake up early.) No matter how long it last. When I woke up and started the coffee and then i just went into office/guest room so I wouldn't wake up anyone. Considering it was like I had 2 left feet and I was l having problems  holding things.


but now it 8:49 and I am wonky feeling weird. Im OK with feeling wonky. I just feel stupid, and I am cool and with stupid but not when I have stuff to do. Which all can be put offuntil at least 3:00. Hopefuly

by then I will more functional. Just hope I can get to baseline by 3ish 


ah... Oh well

2-OxO-PCE, and nearly every disso I tried can linger on the body for some days until you feel baseline again. I myself still feel wonky and slow after nearly a month of 3-MeO-PCP usage, and 2 weeks had passed. 3-MeO-PCP lingers on the body more than 2-OxO-PCE IMO, but you'll still be able to feel after effects next day from use.

Ok so I tried this stuff out. whoa! It is potent. I insufflated about 17mg (used Gemini scale to measure and it may be off .001-.002)

I took on Wednesday night, and I don't have a lot of recollection after about 11:30 pm. I am even having a hard time remembering what I did all day that day. When I woke up Thursday morning, I was walking strange. And was really off all day. Then i started remembering all the things I needed to get done before Friday. And felt really panicky. 


I don't know. Kinda freaked me out. I blame the Xanax I had taken earlier that day for the loss time, even though I took 1mg Xanax around 2pm due to some anxiety.


oh and also my vision was messed up the next day, most of the

day.  I had a hard time seeing clearly. It was really strange

Would you recommend this substance as a "fun" shortime sleeping aid ? In my opinion on medium doses this always feels very sedating for the first 3h and then slowly the stimulating part (monoamine rebound?) sets in. So I'm wondering, whether it can be utilized as a nap aid (if you aim to sleep for 3h and want to be awake after that).

I would use (and I use) GBL for that . at +6h you will be awake because of the dopamine rebound, and fresh as you can get. I don't think 2-oxo-pce would work at all

In my experience it acually can work like that once your body gets used to it and you use a benzo. (I prefer Diclazepam or Flubromazepam due to the longer half-life making it less likely to be anxious or manic on the rebound) Obviously I can't actually recommend that because I feel the combo is dangerous, my heart rate got pretty low. The main problem is, by that point, you feel pretty wonky all the time and I can't recommend driving at that point. 


The monoamine rebound is actually what I assume it is because I kicked my 3-meo-pcp habit after taking this for a couple days, it made it much much easier to kick.

That's interesting, I usually take some alprazolam and snorted 2-oxo-pcm for 2-3 days after a 3-meo binge in order to shut up the craving, and it works pretty well ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

And you find the 2-oxo-pce/pcm does not lead to the same redosing pattern? I'm wondering how you find it works using a disso to chill out from another disso without just leading to more using. I could use a break from the 3-meo-madness. (*Says to self every night*)


I haven't tried this one or it's -PCM cousin so I can't compare.

I can take 2-OxO-PCM without falling into a redosing everyday pattern because for me it's a so light an lackluster experience that I don't really feel like wanting to take again the next day. With 3-MeO I'm always wanting more the next day. 


2-OxO-PCE doesn't seem addictive for me as well, last time I dosed was some months ago and I don't have the desire to take it again, I have got full respect for it so I treat it like psychedelic. 3-MeO puts me in a state that is difficult to not want to be there everyday.

15mg of O-PCE with 9mg of 5-MeO-MiPT was lovely. Oddly more lucid for me than either on its own; had a couple of really useful insights and felt great the next day. Was difficult getting to sleep though.

MSK, I am the complefe opposite. 3 meo pcp wears on me after a few days. I like it more out doing something than at home most times.


Dck and o pce, I like more frequently. Probably moreso the dck. Maybe because it is the more lackluster. Just easy and smooth mostly.

I can relate to that, from all the dissos I have got, the one I take like if it was candy is the DCK. 


Lackluster sounds bad as word, but the "lacklustering" of 2-OxO-PCM is pretty enjoyable, if you get me ;P Just chillout, disconnecting the brain, smoking a spliff, opening a can of beer and beeing in a zen state ![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif)

Yes, I was always snorting it! With 2-OxO-PCM I fell in old MXE/Ketamine abuser patterns, snorting it trough the day, with mild experiences due to high dissociative tolerance. Today I'll try it orally and see if the experience changes, rectal is not my thing at all. I bet things will improve with oral dosing, as they did with oral 3-MeO-PCP or 2-OxO-PCE vs snorted.


It's not lackluster at all, maybe that was a bad word to describe it. Friendly, and uneventful, at least with a massive disso tolerance. A good one for chilling out after a hard day of work.

Had an amazing time with 20mg of 2ci (years without taking a 2c, I forgot how well they combine with dissos) and 30mg 2-oxo-pce. More friendly than when I take it with lysergamides or tryptamines. Take in account my tolerance is massive and 30mg of o-pce, or the combo itself could be very intense to non experienced folks

I have fell in the hole without noticing with o-PCE a few times while gaming, interesting and inmersive experiences xP loved to snort a fat MXE line and launching Skyrim back in the time ;P

I had a few times on MXE with Skyrim, good times, becoming so emotionally immersed in that universe.

The immersion is what I was going for, but I don't think it's as good for me on O-PCE as it was on MXE. With the right dose it was like being in my own movie. I'm wondering if DCK would work better - that one's next on my list to try. Regardless, I clearly need to get things set up how I want them before I start dosing (and clean my room).

 for gaming purposes I would say 3-meo-pcp is the best, with the stimulation it's still an inmersive, but grounded experience

Recently took a high (for my conditions) eyeballed insufflated dose (overall 3 bumps) and it resulted in one of the best drug experiences in my life. I'd say it was the transition to a whole hole. I could barely move (had to piss once) but I recognized my room still when I concentrated on it. Understandably I preferred to lay in my bed and let my surroundings move into clay textures with ancient symbols and tried to have a conversation with god, which ended in a monologue, because they does not like me apparently.


Just saying, that this drug should only be used in full/non functional doses in contrast to 3-Meo-PCP/PCE. It is awesome.


It is also a supreme pain alleviator during the onset. After the comedown the pain increases but the next day it (chronic pain, whose level is changing constantly) is better than before taking it (could be coincidence).

I dosed 33mg... Whoa.. That was at 6pm yesterday. Still not feeling right. I don't usually do many dissos, So I really don't have tolerance to them, I would say. I try things here and there. I was looking to escape reality. 

Not sure what I escaped into. But I was sure out of reality. 


Still not right feeling..

There's a new type of confusion and it's called O-PCE, a rather oh-peaceful name for an anvil. Hear me preach, dear choir.


1mg oral allergy dose already flew within radar, the general radar of mood and the particular alerting from the kidney. Though no such renal trouble noted through the subsequent delivery of 4 x 10mg through the rear. This is a good intuited estimate, though under the respectable standard of actual recollection of exact number. It's reasonable to expect a couple of seconds of retention in memory after turning off the scale with about every other chemical, but this one is different, making an idiot-proof paper record of action a future method to madness to be considered.


Good people drink good beer, but there's only so much amplification of hangover even the saint is willing to accept from a mere two pints of good act. Maybe it's the dissociative itself? Further experiments needed, hopefully not too soon. Who wants frequent surprise visits from a virtuous psychoanalyst. 


Lastly of interest is the sudden appreciation for otherwise unimpressive tryptamines. For one, they remove the effect of leathery aged skin, either hallucinated or physiologically actuated. Though why dissociate terms on a spectrum instead of consciousness.

Sorry, your message is too cryptic too me. Either too poetic for a non native speaker or just crippled because written under the influence.


You saying, you got kidney problems after rectally administrating 40 mg (or already with 1mg?) ? Thanks for clarification.

Only if you consider hangover an influence, or include long term influence, to which I can't plead innocence. I'd like to be more uptight about driving a wedge between poetry and butchering the English language, but I'm not sure this is the right chemical setting for doing so, as a live trip report has been attempted and abandoned. It seems to be pretty harsh on verbal faculties, more so than MXE, DXM or ephenidine.


Funnily my kidneys complained about 1mg oral, but didn't with the subsequent 40mg rectal. A bit reminiscent of other dissociatives, but the disproportion is notable. Pain killing properties might of course be totally skewing bodily signals, but my bet is yet again on the stomach converting this stuff to something unnecessarily renally caustic.

Thanks for the info regarding kidney strain. IMHO this substance lingers too long in the organism and possibly is predetermined to interact with other compounds taken days later.

I found it not to be worth vaping, I'd need relatively big amounts and the effects quickly fade. I only tried vaping amounts up to 14mg though, should I push it any higher? It became some kind of a black puddle, when heated for to long, so watch out to only slowly apply heat to your bowl.

I've been meaning to write up my recent experiences after speaking somehow unfavorably about dissociatives in general when I last joined in on the discussion. This one has been the toughest of all to get the dosage right with, but I have finally figured out that anything past that threshold around the 30mg mark (IM/IV/rectal doesn't seem to make a huge difference) will have me black out, while 3mg less than the sweet spot might not produce the desired reaction. The desired reaction being a fucking riot!! Had a deeply mystical experience with the misses on this last night when coming off MDMA. After years and years of dissociative use these substances still hold so much spiritual value (when they do work as intended for once).

How long does the total duration of vaping it last?


That's the biggest turn off to this one for me (well that and the increase in tinnitus)


I still feel weirded out 12-14 hours after dosing....if I ever use this one again it will be early in the day


It is a beautiful substance...closest thing to mxe I have experienced so far...I bet a combo of this and 3-meo would be really excellent

I bet it would be pretty MXE-like, and even moreso if you used 3-MeO-PCE instead of 3-MeO-PCP.  I realize that this doesn't mean the effects would necessarily be the same, but MXE is 2-OXO-3-MeO-PCE, which is basically o-PCE and 3-MeO-PCE combined into one drug in terms of structure.  When I trialled 3-MeO-PCE I found it to feel just like a certain baseline aspect of the MXE state minus all the intense heady/trippy stuff.  I haven't tried o-PCE (2-OXO-PCE) but peoples' descriptions seem to suggest it is similar to that part of MXE.

3-meo-pcp is pretty good in combo. 3-meo-pce was the best dissociative combo I've ever had.


I'm havin a rough time so I stupidly took drugs, 6am 15mg 2c-e. 3pm 20mg O-pce. 


My skin has never felt better. Like better than mdma but mentally there a ton of loops. I can't stop thinking about what was troubling me. Anyway o-pce extended to 2 hours so def some synergistic effects.

The after effects of this one (24-36h after intake) are nothing to underestimate. Honestly the best parallel I can draw is a low dose of some shitty, apocalyptic stimulant like 2-DPMP.

Well then. I've used something between 1 and 1.5g these last 2-3 weeks, in increments of rectal doses between 10 and 30mg. Returns eventually diminished, as obviously expected, and physical discomfort became prominent in the form of headaches, typically preceded by a metallic taste of sorts (vitamin B12 deficits? Just guessing, not a doctor..). Combination with tryptamines sometimes led to blackouts and intense experiences of "universal reset" which may or may not equate to holing, and rather defy description. Combination with alcohol has been notably free of negative consequences, though I must admit to tolerance in this regard. The combo with acid documented above has been the peak experience.


All in all, physical consequences have been of seemingly minor importance during the whole adventure, creeping dysphoria being the largest drawback, brushing too close to mental breakdown for comfort, having to deal with the embarrassment of having made a fool of myself all too often yet again. On the positive side, old hobbies left behind covered with negative associations were resuscitated. In concreto, there have been intensely insane cesspits of chess played these last couple of weeks.


Conclusion: bumpy ride, would repeat. Though this whole ordeal of pioneering crazy new chemical experiences fills me with a yearning for the simplicity of cannabis, which legal and cultural structures make so impractical to enjoy. Feeling pierced right on the edge of the fence here.

Yes, life hasn't been faring in the spirit of harm reduction lately. I have a group DMT flush planned later this month, so it's in this context I'm rather recklessly indulging. Replicate the described behavioural patterns at your own risk.


I posit though that there is something to be said for going for what feels right, rather than maximizing health, health in the sense of the summum of principles extracted through science and laid upon oneself as greatest common denominator virtue. Of course that's a discussion beyond the scope of this forum.


Here's an example of a dissociated chess game. Just to show that the aforementioned headaches might be mediated through rather insane situational circumstances rather than attributable directly to the 2-oxo-pce. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I only played chess as a child. I know its a shame. Which is the best entry game, that also explaines advanced strategies (more than castlings). Did you perceive any mental enhancements during the game ? I feel mentally pretty sober on that compound. Moreso than on psychedelics at least.

This is the Eticyclidone thread; "O-PCM" would be Meticyclidone, better known as Deschloroketamine (DCK, 2'-Oxo-PCM).

Well there were mental enhancements in the sense that it keeps mood stable in circumstances so disgusting they would otherwise turn off cognition, but other than that I'd like to reinvoke that image of an anvil to the head! ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png) 


But it's still better than psychedelics, yes. The corners of the chessboard squares need not to be wiggling all over the place, with infinity showing itself in the grain of wood. I still want to look whether there's a nootropic sweet spot with microdosing acid though, where creativity is enhanced without hopelessly scrambling the visual field.


I imagine stimulants to be more suited to boost performance in chess, but I'm just not interested in chess when I'm on stimulants. Barring caffeine.


I'm happy to answer that first question of yours, but I'm afraid I can't understand it. Could you please rephrase?

So last week I tried this lovely new dissociative RC. Had some pretty sweet experiences with this so far. Reminds me a lot of MXE, but less stimulating. It gave me the same feeling of flying, but not much CEV's or anthing. This could be because of my tolerance to dissociatives. Works almost like a sedative painkiller, with some mild stimulation in the beginning and lots of dissociative wobbliness. Main effects last about 4 to 6 hours for me, with a lot of residual aftereffects, lasting to the next day and half. Very heavy bodyfeeling, as if gravity itself was multiplied. I kind of love it so far. Very moreish in my experience, but definitely not for everyday use. Kind of hard to nail the dose down with quite some tolerance. I think around 25-30 mg insufflated is my sweet spot. Maybe next time I'll try oral instead of insufflated to see if there's a big difference in ROA. I must admit, after pushing this one for four days, it made me somewhat apathic and slightly down. 


Most lovely part of the experience was the feeling of being wrapped in a soft cotton ball while laying in my bed. Very enjoyable to say the least. The euphoria for me is also a big turn on. I was laying in bed and near the end of the experience after higher dosing I felt like heaven. The only down part is that the experience isn't very rewarding. It feels very nice, but there is no edge to it... It just gives this great feeling without any sort of profound epiphany dissociatives tend to give me. Maybe this is because of my dissociative tolerance to ketamine. I feel like this one works on some different levels of neurotransmittors. Great chemical nonetheless. I would love to combine it with other psychedelics and dissociatives.

This shit is very psychedelic at high doses, eye opening i would say, but almost non visual. Great mood booster at low doses, especially when mixed with low doses of 4-aco-dmt. Potentiates stimulants like nobody's business.


Bottom line: body load, comedown

I haven't tried PCP yet, so I can't comment on your question.


However I have combined it with ketamine, makes it even more wobbly and gives some hallucinations. Even the day after when smoking weed was pretty trippy, like a light N2O trip. Great chemical, terrible comedown. Not too intense, but it just makes me lazy as fuck. Though the pleasant moodlift continues in the days after for me if you're not using it for days on end. Reminds me of DXM in that way.

3-MeO-PCP is considered to be pretty pharmacologically similar to PCP, fwiw... haven't tried PCP to confirm that but there you have it.


Is PCE existant there then? If so, that's interesting.. it sounds pretty stimulating. 3-MeO-PCE is pretty freaking manic I can tell you, if 3-MeO-PCP is so similar to PCP, possibly 3-MeO-PCE is quite close to PCE.

Why does it have to be like PCP rather than just a promising dissociative? 3-MeO-PCP definitely has promise anyway.


I think the distinction between hallucinogen and dissociative is faulty.

Finally tried this one. I´m pretty experienced with dissociatives and tried MXE, Ephenidine, 3-MeO-PCP, 3-MeO-PCE, Ketamine, DXM and MXP. 


O-PCE rocks! So far the closest to MXE. Started with 10mg and redosed 5mg at +1:00 and +2:00. Got some mild dissociative tolerance and the dosage was just fine to chill out, watch simpsons and relax. Vaped some weed during, which greatly boosted the O-PCE. Music sounds lovely on this one. Wish you were here by Pink Floyd was fabulous to listen to. The bodyload was pretty MXE-like.


At +4:00 a friend surprisingly visited me. Social interaction was no problem, we vaped some weed and had a few beers, great fun. 


Overall I really love this new compound.

Anyone got experience with o-pce + ketamine? Just did a 19mg line of o-pce and got 3x25mg Ketamine and 1x 10mg o-pce ready as a booster.

do those substances contribute to the same hole?

I am pretty sure I have done ket on top of o pce. I always just figured ot was one "hole". Even when i have 4-5 chems pulling me out "there", even though they fight a little sometimes, its always more of a combo of the same thing than 4 different directions.


I think I am going to get 500mg of this soon. Was thinking 250 o pce and 250mg 3 me pce, but I am broke and what I have read doesnt entice me to be spendy with 3 meo pce

250mg of O-PCE? Is that a typo? Isn't this compound fully active around 20mg-40mg?

Never tried it myself but your dose sounds way high, even with a tolerance.

yeah it was a cool experience (ketamine + o-pce for clarification), but I found that the o-pce kind of "dulled" the experience...

now I am currently trying 16mg 4-ho-met and will add some k later on, I actually think 4-aco-dmt would work 

as well in this combo, but i think I will keep that for another time!


//well that was weird. it was my first time mixing psychs + ketamine and boy, this was spacey. I cant even put this in

proper words. I wasn't seeing any shaped forms or anything, more of a dusty cloud being. idk. the body feeling was ORGASMIC,

but I was nowhere near my body to take advantage of that. wierd, that I am "back to baseline" after only 2:30h... I typed "back to baseline" before

closing my eyes and seing some fractals, I think some ket would bump this up. see you around ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

Took like 7mg etiz to knock me out by 8am. Add im the 5 beers and two hours sleep and im hungover as shit. Need to work on my car. Solution, hit a pizza buffet, get a 4 loko, take 5mg o pce and soldier on. Fuck it.

Okay, so nobody ever do this. Being hungover, sleepless, pissed, and rushing, i fucked up and undid the damper bolt (one thing you DO NOT do). Now my strut dropped onto my cv joint possibly breaking it. In my idiocy I tried for a day and a half to fix it myself, butits just not happening. Now my car is at the shop and I am waiting to here what all shit I broke being a moron.


Guy at shop is like "thats what happrns when you do it yourself." Ive saved 2k plus on car repairs in the past two years doing it myself. This is what happens when you are a dumbass. Fuck

disso head here. IM'd 3-meo-pcp to limited effect at 40mg (although the vendor's quality is in question, but oral dosing seemed to be in line with what was expected from research). 3-meo-pce might as well have been inert. i would shoot my mxe at 50-70mg (never was fond of the stuff though). k 120+mg. 4-meo-pcp at 200mg IM once (that's all i had of it). dck upwards to 90mg. thinking of trying 20mg IM with o-pce. should i start lower? i don't actually have a tolerance. i don't do dissos often, but i like  to go deeeeep on them. i don't like partial dissociation. holes or bust.

I've said it a few times in this thread. Oral is a strong hole, nasal is like really bad slightly psychedelic cocaine. (stimulation, mild euphoria, sometimes bouts of talkativeness)

Ah okay. There's something I really enjoy about bumping dissos, but if the effects are more worthwhile then oral it is!

What is your oral dose for holing? Do you use dissociatives often? 

I have some on the way.  I love bumping dissociatives and chilling with friends but I also really love being by myself in bed, in a dark room with some good music on while I'm deeply dissociated.

When I was first trying it out I would take 30mg in water, consumed at once. If you do redose, the lethargy and semi-negative effects increase dramatically. I've taken up to 85mg in a single dose after using it with some frequency. 


I don't really use many at the moment and last time I did 30mg and it had a similar hole to the first time.

After finally figuring out my sweet spot (25mg IM or 30mg rectal with a redose of 5mg and 10mg respectively as soon as I am able to) I can say with certainty that this is my favourite dissociative. I've had K a few times in the past months and have no desire to ever use it again since it has lost it's magic for me. One of the biggest issues is 2-Oxo-PCE's duration, but at the same time this has kept me from abusing it. No redosing until I pass out as I tend to with ketamine.


Another thing that makes this a standout substance is the fact that it is the most empathogenic dissociative I have ever tried. Using it with my wife (yes, I am finally married!) every 3 months or so has been nothing short of magical.


The after effects can last up to two days with impaired vision and motor skills being the predominant symptoms so best have some good movies at hand for that. Planet Earth II was awesome. :D

This stuff is very pleasant. It reminded me a good bit of DCK and of MXE but with its own unique flavor. 

I tried snorting 28mg divided in to 2 doses 30 minutes apart. That trip was a bit underwhelming so I ended up supplementing with a little 3 meo pcp to spice things up. The combo is very nice and can get pretty psychedelic. 

Two days after that I tried the oral route. 20mg then another 15mg an hour later. It takes a while to peak but once it does it's such a nice calm dissociation with a definite positive push. I didn't reach a hole at this dose but it was lovely to just just lay back with eyes closed and get lost in the music.

 I could tell it certainly has the potential to reach a hole. Next time I'm going to go for a larger oral dose all at once, probably 30-40mg. I'm excited to do it again but the lasting effects of this drug are no joke. I still felt dissociated this morning, over 12 hours after taking it.

This one has some overpowering euphoria ime. It isn't functional like 3-meo-pcp but I got on fine just sitting around with my blue LED light illuminating the room, thoroughly enjoying the ambience. Couldn't ask to feel anymore content then I do on this stuff, I feel fine just taking it all in while chilling like a monk, appreciating the moment.

While I didn't find the euphoria overpowering it was significant and very pleasant. The rest of my trip trip sounds remarkably similar to yours.

I think I prefer.this to 3 meo pce after about a gram of each. To be fair I have done most  of the 3 meo in about 3 week. The o pce was probabpy closer to a year I would say. I do recall liking it more earlier in my trials.


Either way bth have more euphoria than 3 meo pcp I woild say, but golly do they have have fucking legs. Redose and its like 8mg etizolam to go. More so the 3 meo pce I think. I will hopefully save some of the 3 meo pce until I have more o pce eventually)  so I can have a more timelyi frame of refernce for observation.


I think o pce is probably better for me though.

3-meo-pce doesn't worth enough yo pay those insane high prices per gram IMHO. I did 500mg in doses from 20 to 100mg without enjoying it very much, I would choose between 2-oxo-pce or 3-meo-pcp usually, won't restock the 3-meo-pce again.

A few days ago, out of the blue, I had an intuition. Possibly, if o-pce and 3-meo-pce were combined in the right ratio, it could produce the closest simulation of MXE we have available. Just a bunch. But if anyone has a good quality material of both, feel free to experiment!

I've tried this combo 4 times, it was a little too intense once (o-pce taken 2 hours after 3-meo-pce), one time it was super fun and very "mentally blanking" (o-pce taken 1 hour after 3-meo-pce) and the other two I think I messed up the times since I took them at the same time rather than 3-meo-pce then an hour late o-pce. Interesting combo though.

I actually did a base of 3-meo-pce with bumps of K a few years back.

It remindended me of mxe but better IMO.

Since that way i could regulate the intensity with the ket.

This weekend I had one of the most trippy experiences of my life combining 30mg of 2-oxo-pce + 25mg 4-ho-met. Was holing hard for about an hour and was left with an ayahuasca-like high for about 6h after that. Needed to put myself to sleep with etizolam because I couldn't take the intensity anymore and the high didn't showed signs of wearing off soon. But fuck, it was like an 8h DMT experience, will repeat for sure with better set&setting

Always oral. Nasal is more stimulating and I try to avoid that ROA because it's very morish and could lead to innecesary redoses. Also oral last longer and it's stronger, so double profit. Tryptamine + disso is currently my drug combo of choice. Or if I want a less psychedelic and functional high 3-meo-pcp + lysergamides is awesome on it's own too, more recreational though.


Please report back when you try it. I was trying to pull out a trip report for those experiences but can't find the way of putting them into words in my mother language (spaniard hardcore dissohead bastard is what I am) so trying to describe them in english is even harder.


Be sure to be near a bed and in a safe place when doing. The first part of the experience is intense, confusing and out of body like, so you will want to put some music or film on the backgroud and confortably fall into the rabbit hole in your bed. Enjoy and be safe! ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

So... that was ahhhh... an experience. I'll update in the morning. 


23mg of 4-ho-met and 30 o-pce. It hit really really fast. 


Main note for the future, maybe I shouldn't take heavy drugs during a break up. Very positive still, super excited for my future!


Chose "We all want to fly" by Inspired Flight and it was the perfect choice.

Alright well the best way I am going to try and describe that experience is... blanketed. You know that MDMA warmth? It was like that but opposite. Instead of loved up, I felt like love was some obsolete and almost repulsive idea. I turned off all the lights and tucked myself under a blanket. Music was under my pillow blaring. The odd thing was I felt so free in the blanket that getting up to put more wood on so I wouldn't freeze was like having this weird tightness wrap around me. 


I kept seeing lights appear under the blanket and dance for me. Just dancing and dancing and dancing, happy little lights. Then I closed my eyes and let the music really enter me... that's when I felt this just explosion of positivity and my vision had tiny little fractal lines. Now I am kinda shaky a day later but I am really excited to trip again. I started taking 3-meo-pcp about 8 in the morning after being up since last night. It just seemed right. That's when I started posting all over bluelight. So, I have actually had a rather social day after that. It left me with that DMT-esque "Fuck yeah! Let's life right now!" feeling. 


Overall I'd say an 8 out of 10 because of the oddness.

Took 15mg orally a little over an hour ago and effects are present, but mild. Was hoping for a little more at this dosage, although I did do a little bit of DCK and 3-MeO-PCP over the weekend so tolerance may be a factor. Just smoked a bit of oil to see if it amps up the effects.

Hello, all. Just some quick thoughts. It seems like my experiences don't match up with a lot of the posts I'm reading about eticyclidone/O-PCE. I know that the product I'm getting is indeed O-PCE.


I have tried two batches of O-PCE so far. 1g each. My previous experience with dissociatives includes:

-nitrous oxide, of course, of course

-ketamine, only a few times, but significant

-methoxetamine, I went through a lot of that stuff when it was still easily obtainable

-methoxphenidine, I tried it once, hated it, felt like nasty PCP world (I have never actually tried PCP, I just imagine that there are good dissociates like K and O-PCE, and then there are bad ones like PCP and methoxphenidine, just my opinion)


So I guess I have a little bit of residual tolerance. But at the time of taking both batches, I had little to no dissociative tolerance. I had to titrate my way up to my full doses, being extremely careful and clean, of course.


I started O-PCE with nasal dosages, very small at first, like I said. I took notes and worked my way up to 35mg doses. My notes from those doses describe entering a peaceful dreamlike world, where everything was very soft. I was reminded of something vague that I couldn't put my finger on, just a general sense of calm and quiet. I felt like I was gently wrapped in cotton. With incense burning, and some quiet music on, it was very lovely. I noticed that there was a bit of auditory distortion or improved appreciation for music. It was like hearing my favorite music for the first time, noticing new things I hadn't heard before. I got that a lot on methoxetamine.


After establishing a firm ground with nasal dosing, I began to try IV shots of O-PCE. Please note, I am not a needle freak, I have a supply of fresh, clean sharps, and I do not use them more than once. I don't go through a lot of them because I do not use them often. (I just always feel like I have to defend myself on that point.) You will never notice any tracks on me, either. I do not go overboard, never have, never will. That's all.


Anyway, the IV doses were just supreme. They reminded me of IV shots of about 125mg of methoxetamine, at the dose of about 30mg of O-PCE. The rush would come on immediately, a sense of excitement and importance, like "something major that involves the entire world is about to happen, and I am at the center of it." Grandiose ideology. I knew to watch out for that because it is so common with methoxetamine. But that's just the rush. What followed was a nice, kinda light trip. Visuals would come in and out. One day, when one of my friends came over to do laundry, we were in my laundry facility, and I noticed that, growing on the walls was a vast mound of grayish-green mold with bright, shining jewels embedded in it. These images would basically disappear if I concentrated and tried to do something. They would come back on if I just relaxed and cleared my mind. In total, the longest trip from an IV dose of O-PCE lasted about an hour and a half for me. In general, they would be the rush, a bit of trippiness and music appreciation, some dissociation, and pretty much done by about an hour.


That has been my experience so far. I enjoy it very much and hope to get more very soon. I have thought about trying larger IV doses. I mean, once I titrate up to that level. But, for me, O-PCE is wonderful. I am given to enjoying dissociatives, but I swear by O-PCE. I have a friend or two who will, too. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

30mg is ideal for me as well. However the rush doesn't set in quite as intenselely or fast as it does when IV'ing ketamine.


I IV'ed 100mg MDMA (tested) along with 30mg 2-O-PCE the other week and it was absolutely heavenly. MDMA combines exceptionally well with this one.

This is the king of comboland, I don't consider taking it without mixing anymore. 


At least I mix with weed and some beer, I reached ego loss with just smoking a spliff.


Tryptamines as well mix nice with this drug, amazing experiences very similar to high doses of smoked DMT

Smoked some 5-meo-dmt on it last time and ended up vomiting a good bit. I think it was a little less then 10mg 5-meo-DMT and 30mg O-pce about an hour before. Felt good after the initial rush but didn't enjoy the puking.

Oh, man. I bet. Kittyflipping with this one would be amazing. I have 125mg of MDMA in a gelcap in my fridge. I will try this once the O-PCE I purchased just now arrives.

Yesterday was the day for my monthly tryptamine + 2-oxo-pce trip. 20mg 2-OxO-PCE + 18mg 4-AcO-DMT


Instead of taking both at the same time as I usually do I chosed to dose the 2-OxO-PCE first and take the 4-AcO-DMT 3h into the dissociative experience. That way, instead of the out of body experience I usually have when combining both at the same time, I just had an awesome and recreative disso high followed by a not really potentiated 4-AcO-DMT usual experience (but less mindfucky because of the "I don't give a fuck" disso component). 


I think I prefer the effect of combining both at the same time, a lot more spiritual and hardcore experience. Also I usually dose it with 25mg 4-HO-MET instead of 4-AcO-DMT, maybe 18mg was a low dose as well.

I.M.ing it is by far my favorite method. It helps end the legs. 


It's a dissociative, so I guess that is like MXE... I don't really see a reason to compare it to MXE much though because it has a lovely effect and so does MXE but they aren't the same.

does anyone know why this particular drug has such a different effect profile, depending on the ROA?

I took a loooong break from dissos and snorted 27mg o-pce + some leftover DCK and haven't really felt much (I am at +3:00 rn). 

It's either my tolerance (which shouldn't be much of an issue) or the ROA (nasal). I remember (kind of xD) that I got knocked out when I took 25mg orally, but that

was before all my disso tolerance was present. o-pce feels like a cloudy K for me, if not less. I've never gotten my hands in MXE, unfortunately. btw:

how likely do you see 3-Ho-PCE become any relevant in the disso scene? I don't like to much stimulation with my dissos

I found nasal to be very lackluster. Stimulation, spacey feelings, and some good vibes. I always do oral or I.M. since nasal seems such a waste. I figure it's that first pass that brings out the golden effect.


I am putting in for my 3-ho-pce today. I'll let ya know haha.

damn I just put my order through and didn't go for the ho-pce due to the stimulant properties, what if it's the next MXE? :D imma ask if they could hook me up anyways ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


is there any way to find out what your disso tolerance is at? I mean I did lotsa K to the point where 200mg wouldn't hole me, idk about the purity though... I should have felt something with the 

27mg opce+dck though, right? it was both nasally, hopefully my tolerance isn't fucked up in the arse


//edit: wouldn't the new compound feel somewhat like MXE? since it affects the mu opioid receptor?

if you had 60% pure K a 200mg line would only be 120mg of actual K. So if you think your shit is cut.....


I just sniffed 35mg DCK about 2 hours ago. Feel less than the 25 oral I took before that. I've been through multiple G's of it, I know sniffing it sucks but still do it on occasion becuase I'm an idiot. 


I remember O pce being about the same. Sniffing it was a waste and a shitty high. Oral etc is where it's at. You might feel more from an oral dose of 15mg than you did snorting the 27mg.

Thx for the info, because normally it is the other way round. 

Deschloroketamin was a little bit more effective when i sniffed it than with oral application.

I snorted like 100mg of 2-oxo-pcm with little effects yesterday, while 50mg oral does the job.


With 2-oxo-pce snorting seems a waste as well. With 3-meo-pcp it worths to snort on some situations, but the dose needed is higher as well.

I like all dissos except ketamine that I've tried better orally, and I also find them more potent orally.  The only one I take nasally is 3-MeO-PCP, usually, because I don't like to get dissociated on it, I like it for its stimulating properties which are better snorted.  But I agree it's more potent orally.

That's the point, I tend to snort 3-meo only if I want to use it as a stimulant (better than any real stimulant BTW), if I'm socializing with other people taking the substance snorted as well, if I need to do work the next day and should sleep earlier, or if I want a lighter and shorter experience. 3-meo really worths and shines a lot in those situations.


But with all the other ones (Except ketamine) oral seems the way to go, snorting is just a mediocre less potent experience.


What makes me wonder.... Why the fuck ketamine seems to be the only arylcyclohexamine that is more potent snorted than oral?

I love this stuff! Yesterday I started with 16mg, added 5mg at +1:00 and added 10mg DCK and vaped some weed for some sedation at +2:00. Beautiful dissociation, adding some nitrous made me travelling through the multiverses. Near hole territory.  Music was awesome, Dark Side Of The Moon by Pink Floyd was incledibly good to listen to. My cats got some kind of contact high during the experience, they made me laugh multiple times during the experience and cuddling was super smooth.

No way. Route of administration always has an influence on the qualitative effects of a dissociative experience. IV, IM, inhaled (in the case of PCP) is usually my preferred ROA.

I  couldn't try that one jet, IV/IM will obviously be the most potent route. But snorting 2-oxo-pce/2-oxo-pcm doesn't work very well for me, lackluster experiences vs oral route. Of course every body is different and that just could be true for me.

I have a question for the people who have accidentally ingested more 2-OxO-PCE than they meant to. During my heady days of MXE use, sometimes I would wind up utterly confused. This tended to happen towards the end of sessions after multiple redoses. The most particular time I remember, I was chilling in *MY* apartment, with a lot of close friends. And I didn't know where I was, or who anyone was. I was looking at these people I knew very well and all I could do was say, "who ARE you?" over and over. Is that kind of like what happens when 2-oxo-pce gets "beastly"?

  The experience of a high dose of 2-oxo-pce can be like that. I woke up from the hole very confused a lot of times from this substance, without recognizing my own room or beeing able to recognize who I am. I always trip alone, but if any friend or my flatmate were at that time with me, I wouldn't recognize them at all.  


I'm looking forward to trying this in combination with a lysergamide this Monday, any tips arround? I usually combine it with a tryptamine, but can't remember if I tried the combo with acid. I have got LSD, ALD-52, ETH-LAD and AL-LAD. I think I'm going to do it with 300ug ETH-LAD and taking 30mg of 2-OxO-PCE 3h into the lysergic trip, and maybe some 2-OxO-PCM lines and weed joints, and I'm going for a whole month drugs break after that, I was taking dissos and psychedelics very frequently this month. Wish me luck!

I notice a lot of people take dissos after taking a psychedelic. I've always done it the other way around. First load up on disso, let it hit and peak then take the psychedelics. Hits pretty hard this way IME, perhaps a bit unpredictably so. Curious if anyone has an opinion on which order is preferable for those who have tried it both ways [i.e disso then psyche or psyche then disso]. More of a general question, haven't tried O-PCE. And yes, good luck MSK!

Little warning 150mcg ETH-LAD and 150mcg AL-LAD taken 2 hours before 30mg O-PCE resulted in a  4 hour vomit fest. I usually love the ALD-52 and O-PCE combined but these ones don't seem to play as well together.

O-PCE is quite good plugged, I usually plug 15-20mg doses, 20 may be much, and a grand total of 250mg over 24 hours or so. I only take it plugged because it works so well. Its a reasonable substitute for MXE.

Hits pretty hard this way IME, perhaps a bit unpredictably so. Curious if anyone has an opinion on which order is preferable for those who have tried it both ways [i.e disso then psyche or psyche then disso]. More of a general question, haven't tried O-PCE. And yes, good luck MSK!

I'm finally taking your advice just for the sake of changing my habits. Took 35mg 2-OxO-PCE an hour ago and dropped 300ug AL-LAD just now. Will update and the end of the day with conclusions on this matter, as I have different patterns of taking dissos and psycedelics I want to share, but I'm a bit dissociated right now for keep typing. See you in a few hours! :D

Just so that people can nuance copying habits like yours, what do you think makes you able to keep taking dosages of drugs like that and remaining functional (bearing in mind your regimen on a normal day)?


And I do truly mean in a very neutral way to share more about our different patterns and abilities to tolerate our habits.


This instead of having to wait for everyone with their habits to escalate into problems - or not at all.

It's helpful for people to have more insight on what can work and what just does not work - and why! :D


I found O-PCM to be very burdening on a very long tail-end and others have said the same thing. O-PCE doesn't seem to be too different. So how can you still go about your business, combined with psychedelics and/or weed or G etc when it is not even weekend? How active are your business then - I have heard of just a regular job with enough duties.


Again, not judging, it is just good for others who might take this as an example to realize what makes this work or what makes it exceptional. Cheers.

I actually find O-PCE to be functional under 10mg or after 5 hours below 35mg. 


I find all of these dissociative drugs to be very useful for post-trip pain relief. I have used 8mg for helping me at work as I have to walk about 12miles for my job everyday.

I always forget advising after posting my dosages that I'm a disso and psychedelic hardhead. **DON'T TAKE MY DOSES AS AN EXAMPLE OF ANYTHING!**


My disso tolerance is fucked up because of many years of daily use of ketamine and MXE, and this past month was a bit crazy and I did some kind of disso nearly weekly, so 35mg was not a high dosage for me, judging that the day before taking this combo I was snorting ketamine and 2-OxO-PCM like if it was the end of the world.


Psychedelics, I don't know what it is, but it seems to be a natural tolerance to the effects, I never manage to have got a lot of mindfuck or visuals from my trips, even when I was beggining and there wasn't any tolerance to talk about. I'm taking psyhedelics no more than once a month, and always combined them with dissos since last year, so it's a familiar feeling for me.


The combo wasn't hard for what I'm used, the 2-OxO-PCE barely was felt and the 300ug of AL-LAD was a mild trip, not very potentiated by the 2-OxO-PCE. Was really functional the whole time, managing to surf the internet, understand films, and move trough the flat, but a bit slow at work today. Yesterday I had a day off because of carnival ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) Though, my intention was not to be functional at all, but be smashed by a "dissodelic" punch.


I just need a break, that starts today and ends on the first of next month.

I guess tolerance isn't a complex explation.. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) My confusion may be from the fact that I have pretty much permanent K tolerance but O-PCM still floored me and gave me almost nothing good in return.

Yeah, I don't like 2-oxo-pcm very much, but snorting it and smoking some joints is my way to return to the K-land without needing ket. 


At low/medium doses it feels pretty similar. 


At higher dosages you can feel it's not the same at all and it lacks some magic. Really lackluster by itself, but nice as an ingredient for combos. 


My 2-oxo-pcm holes were confusing and amnesic, without a desire to repeat the experience.


With ket, oh lord, I swear I tried really hard to get some effects again from it, but nothing works. Maybe IM will do the trick, but don't want to ride that horse until I'm way older ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

If you mean O-PCE, I really wouldn't worry about any stimulant properties. At doses of around 30-40mg nasally (after building up a slight tolerance), I felt very calm, serene, spacey but collected, and very content. With IV doses, I could hole pretty frequently and consistently with around the same dose. That is a bit more manic-y, although I hesitate to use that word; it is not manic like MXE. As far as it being the next MXE, I think that seems kind of in reverse. Both substances are analogs of PCE, which is itself an analog of both ketamine and PCP. O-PCE shares a bit more in common with ketamine than with PCP (thank god). But my point: MXE is 3-methoxy-2'-oxo-PCE. O-PCE is 2'-oxo-PCE. This makes O-PCE a lower homolog, closer to PCE; it seems like it should have been the one to come out first. But thankfully, it didn't, and it's still around!

I don't have any experience with DCK and limited experience with ketamine due to where I live, but I know 200mg is getting up there. I would take a break for a while, a month at least, but I don't think your tolerance is permanently destroyed or anything drastic. I personally find that it's easier, or at least more reliable, to hole with O-PCE, even if the hole is a bit different.

> 		
> Click to expand...


Well.. first off, it feels a bit like MXE, especially when IVed. I like the effects more than MXE, and it doesn't stick around for hours and hours like MXE. As far as the mu opioid binding, that was mostly an urban legend with MXE. Its effects at that receptor are negligible, although I did notice that when combined with pharmaceutical opioids, there was definitely a synergy with MXE. I have not done the same kind of experiment yet with O-PCE, but I know it has even less, if any, action at the mu opioid receptor. Some arylcyclohexylamines have weak activity at the kappa opioid receptors, but to say that O-PCE affects them would be speculative at this point.


Just to be clear and up front, not trying to be a jerk here. I'm happy to answer any other questions that I'm able to.

Good question. I don't really have an answer, but I've always noticed that ketamine kicks in IMMEDIATELY when snorted, like cocaine. MXE was not like that, O-PCE is not like that. Maybe ketamine bonds more rapidly or easily to the mucus membrane? Anybody's guess..

This tended to happen towards the end of sessions after multiple redoses. The most particular time I remember, I was chilling in *MY* apartment, with a lot of close friends. And I didn't know where I was, or who anyone was. I was looking at these people I knew very well and all I could do was say, "who ARE you?" over and over. Is that kind of like what happens when 2-oxo-pce gets "beastly"?

Hey. I can definitely relate to your negative MXE experiences. After going through almost 300mg one night (lots of redoses after starting with 80mg nasally), I ended up very confused the next morning, having small crying fits. I tried to go see my parents but didn't recognize any of the streets at all, streets that I travel daily.


I have done enough O-PCE in an IV shot that, by the time I needed to go do something, I was functional socially and physically, but I could not for the life of me remember how to tie my shoes. That happened frequently with MXE, too. However, I would not compare the two in this regard. MXE could get scary if you tested it. O-PCE is not as more-ish, for me. It may be because I generally go with the IV route and don't like to poke myself, but I've never found myself redosing O-PCE. It is very potent by mass, especially compared to MXE.

I IVed mxe occasionally (and the first time I did it is the only time a drug ever, beyond a shadow of a doubt, convinced me that I was dying. But that's another story.) I much preferred to IM though. Have only ever IMed O-PCE?

I have done nasal and IV doses of O-PCE only, so far. And I have to amend a previous statement. On one occasion, when giving a starter dose of O-PCE to a couple of friends who greatly enjoyed the MXE I shared with them a year before, I was given a smallish amount of H, maybe 0.085g. Enough for me, as an extremely rare user of H. It did have some synergy. Nothing like what I got from taking methadone with MXE, though.


Honestly, I really don't know how to administer an IM shot. I have a totally irrational worry that it wouldn't be as potent or kick in as fast as IV. There is definitely a rush right before the hole with O-PCE. I make a game out of how quickly I can go wash the barrel out, wrap a warm, wet towel around the injection site, and get back into my chair before it overtakes me.

That's not irrational, it's true. I just found IV mxe unpleasant, the slower (but still by far faster than any roa besides IV) comeup of Im was much more pleasant for me.

Well IM certainly does not kick in as fast as IV, there will be less of a peak rush.  IM is a a good ROA though.  I for one have decided to never IV, but I will IM on rare occasions for things like ketamine and DPT (the combo specifically, or maybe with MXE instead).


IM is more likely to produce an abcess if not done in sterile conditions, though to me IV is definitely more dangerous overall.

Combined 3-ho-PCE and 3-meo-PCE and 2-oxo-PCE recently and had one of the greatest trips so far (a very schizophrenic hole so to say).


t+0 : Insufflation of 5-10mg 3-ho-PCE

t+10 : Rode the bike to the grocery store chain (had to go a bit further because it was the last one open at 11:30 in the night). Did not feel much, in fact it felt like a typical insufflated dose of 3-meo-PCE

t+60 : Took 3 big bumps of 2-oxo-PCE (~20-30mg), wholed hard, not much recollection, many voices in my head, awesome visuals, a sense of a presence of entitites

t+160 : Took 10mg of 3-meo-PCE and 10mg 2-oxo-PCE and set in full lotus in front of a wall for the remainder of the trip (about 100 min ?), the main theme was complete emptiness with visuals and black outs

t+240 : I went to sleep with the help of melatonine (prepared beforehand).


Yeah it was fun. The next day I could barely walk straight but after a good long run through the woods I sweated much of it out and after that I felt fucking GREAT.


Resume of the story for me is : Abusing dissos is much more forgiving if you prepared your environment (because moving is incredible difficult) beforehand than abusing psychs. Mental trainwrecks are very unlikely with good dissos (i.e. the PCEs). I would never abuse 3-meo-PCP because it seems to have more potential for psychosis because of the dopaminergic affinity profile.

I'm so excited to try that combo. It's the one I've been eyeing for awhile. 


On the IV vs IM, I have found the IM is more "full bodies" as the amnesia hits strong after first effects. With IV it's the same time for me.

I'd say I was lucky, that the 3-ho-PCE did not hit me that hard. So beware the dosage, it could end in a disaster.


low dose 3-ho-PCE felt like between 3-meo-PCE and 3-meo-PCP but further solo experiments are due.

Be careful moving around after having IV dissociatives. 

With mxe you very easily wake up on the floor sometime afterwards, if you stood up after administering it.

I wouldnt recommend standing up for at least a minute or two after injecting drugs like dissociatives or hallcuinogens.  The effects sneak up on you very quickly, and anything approaching an anaesthetic dose or hole would be a bad thing to still be standing or walking when it kicks in, because your body may just collapse under you.

You should always be seated when IVing anything, but these drugs - especially.


Admittedly, i've not tried this chem.

Sounds pretty interesting though.

Hands down my favourite dissociative. I've said this before about others, but this one is the fucking shit. If it was only a teeny tiny bit more sedating, on par with ketamine, I'd like it even better. Ketamine ain't shit compared to this though. I don't even bother using it anymore even when free vials were offered to me on two occasions lol.


Yes, it's that good. Been also warning extensively about the IV dissociative issues myself in that report I just posted. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

Yeah after I talked it down for a while after the first trials I also must say it is the most utilizable disso around. A hole is always guaranteed, if the dose allows it and it has very few negative after effects.


Plus it excels in combination (keep the dose lower then).

Speed of absorption and metabolic factors. If a substance is converted to an inactive one or to one that has a different effects profile, the conversion will happen at a particular rate dependent on the plasma concentration, genetic factors, state of your liver, kidneys, other medication etc.


Generally speaking, faster absorption will maximize the effects. 


Not only will there be a higher peak plasma concentration, simply because the body usually can't metabolize a substance as fast as it is being absorbed, but the reaction of your cells will usually also be stronger. This is due to the cellular adaptive mechanisms that take place upon activation of a target cell. 


There are usually negative feedback mechanisms involved when it comes to monitoring the activation of receptors. You flood your receptors with a substance, the target receptor proteins will cause a reaction, this reaction is registered and measures are taken to decrease the impact like downregulation.  A cell can for example move transmembranous receptor proteins to the inside of the cell in order to desensitize itself towards the incoming ligands. This is part of why a tolerance to most drugs develops.

Other possibilities are that a factor important to the metabolization is being produced or released to a greater extent, e.g. many substances induce or inhibit production of enzyme proteins from the CYP P450 family, but this mechanism is not limited to them. Maybe some coenzymes that were kept back before will now be released and make processing of the substance easier for enzymes that are already produced.


These feedback mechanisms are often not limited to the targeted cells alone, but possibly to other tissue in your body as well.


So when a substance is absorbed very quickly, the body doesn't have sufficient time to 

1) adapt in order to desensitize 

2) metabolize or excrete the substance


A great example for quick desensitization is MDMA which causes MUCH stronger reactions when taken rectally or when it is injected intravenously. It releases MDMA from the serotonergic presynapse which then floods the postsynaptic serotonin receptors. This desensitization NOT only happens at the target cell, but also in the cell that releases the substance (into which it is transported back by other transmembranous proteins).


An example for quick metabolization is heroin (desensitization also plays a big role though). It's metabolized so quickly that before a full oral dose has been absorbed most of it has already been gotten rid of. Therefore the instant flooding via inhalation or intravenous injection means that when a person has finished his shot/smoke, most of the heroin is still active.


Most arylcyclohexylamines undergo extensive metabolization by a large number of different proteins, resulting in a plethora or different metabolites. One of ketamine's metabolites for example is responsible for it's antidepressant action, despite not causing you to trip.

It is not clear how exactly 2-Oxo-PCE is metabolized afaik, but the usual suspects (CYP P450) are known to do catalyze small number of chemical reactions better than other reactions. E.g. one is very good at N-demethylation of monoamines, another O-demethylates or deacetylate. You can therefore make assumptions that protein X catalyzes process Y at a position Z of substance XYZ. I think you get the idea. Most RC's are never really investigated for what is their fate inside the body. What is relatively common is just throwing them in a dish with various enzymes and look at the results or deduce from the metabolites found in the blood, urine and stool.


One more thing is distribution throughout your body. The substance might be present in more or less equal amounts across all tissues after entering the bloodstream, but are taken up better by some tissue over other tissue and therefore the activity in the different organs can start varying greatly after that. In some cases this is due to the body's intention to metabolize them or simply keep them out of other tissue (think glia cells that contribute to the BBB), in other instances the physical properties of a substance dictate where they end up, simply because different tissue has different properties. E.g. some substance dissolve better in more polar environments than others (polarity or logP O/W).


Lol I was only gonna write two sentences.

First time with this, ingested 10mg. Very mellow and sociable,uninhibited mood. Totally functional, but if i just sit down and keep quiet, it gives me a "submarine" feeling, and there is a pronounced feeling of wonkiness very reminiscent of mxe. I've been cruising with 3-meo-pcp so long that I think my nmda receptors need to attune a bit to get most out of this new substance...


edit; 5 hrs later... Plugged 10 mgs more. What warmth... PCE is the Lady and PCP the king... I guess PCM the court jester?

Eticyclidone kicked my ASS last night! I snorted ~15 mg, and that was fun and wonky. I went along for a car ride (did not drive obviously) and just enjoyed it. When I got back, I snorted another ~20mg, and that's when shit really hit the fan. I think it may be the highest I've ever been on a disso. I think I holed, because there was a moment where all of a sudden lucidity returned to me. I was still tripping balls, but I looked to my friend and "I think I just came out of a hole." There was all this buzzing noise, and I asked my friend if he heard anything, he was like "no." I turned off his space heater, which was making a lot of the noise, but still, I could hear the buzzing.


Man, I really can't describe it. I was just fucking obliterated.  It was so fucking intense. I wish I could articulate it better. If 3-MeO-PCE is going for a nice swim in a placid lake, O-PCE was like being tossed about it a tropical storm.


I tried vaping a little bit, like ~20mg total. It hurt my throat, but I'm pretty sure it worked. Not worth it, though. Insufflated onset was pretty damn quick.


Honestly I think that was one of the most intense trips of my life. It wasn't quite the time I snorted 80 - 100 mg DPT (eyeballed, my first RC). But it earned a spot up there, for sure.


Edit: I remember popping a couple etiz, and I also remember going to bed. But when I woke up this morning, there was only one left in the blister pack. So  I may have felt compelled to keep taking them, and then blacked out. I don't still feel tiz'ed out this morning though, which I think I would if I had actually taken 6 or so mg. I just remember taking the first two, because things were getting so fucking intense.


Also, I snorted ~8mg at some time between the first 15 mg line and the 20 mg line. Will definitely be more patient next time! Not that I had a bad trip or anything, but JESUS. It was fucking heavy.


I'm also a bit nauseas this morning. Anyone else get that?

After some few experiments with o-pce I can say I like the effects more than others' substances. The euphoria and magic depth is quite similar to MXE, though also diferent.

 But, for me, the problem with this substance is that it has no afterglow like MXE and others. Instead of that, what I get is a couple of days feeling physically and mentally drained. I am not sure if it is the substance to blame, or just this specific batch.

 Anyone gets the same nasty after effects from o-pce?

I have got hangover effects from all the current generation dissos, but I'm also usually mixing them with alcohol, weed, tryptamines/lysergamides, GBL and benzos, so it's not surprising for me to feel like shit for days after.


Anyone reading, don't try this at home! I have got permatolerance to dissos, and a high tolerance to all the substances that fuck with GABA.

Benzos with O-PCE make me feel drained the next day. Weed and O-PCE leaves me with stomach problems the next day. Other Dissociatives and O-PCE usually leave me with muscle aches. O-PCE and Opioids are stupid and don't do it but it totally enhance the poo effect. 


Hope that helps.

I have the most hangover effects from 3-meo-PCE. (sensitive to serotonine depletion). I never had hangovers from 3-meo-PCP, just a lingering stimulation feeling (slightly tight chest) the next day. After deschloroketamine I have a little worse mood but nothing to write home about. After MXP iI feel very overstimulated and angry the next day, can get into seneseless arguments rather easily. Similar with 2-oxo-PCE I have excessive energy the next day, that sometimes manifests itself in anger issues. (speculation is, that it and the other NMDA-antagonists have effects on hormone balance, and sometimes a testo boost can be triggered).


Weird thing is, that after escalated combo trips like with 3-ho-PCE, 3-meo-PCE and 2-oxo-PCE  I did not have a hangovers but glowing after effects but I'm very sure, that it is extremely unhealthy to do that more than once a month

Interesting answers... I guess there is some subjectivity on the hangover effects with these dissocitives, since some of the comments coincide with my experience but other are diferent. As a summary on my side, sorted from better to worse after-effects:


-MXE: nice afterglow the days after, positive mood, euphoria and maybe a bit of tiredness if the dose was high, but nothing to worry.

-3-meo-pce: it has the cleanest afterglow for me, a functional positive mood for a couple of days or more.

-Ketamine: nice afterglow, but also a more noticeable tiredness.

-3-meo-pcp: positive afterglow for some days, but very subtle, almost neutral.

-ephenidine: some tiredness for a couple of days, but not very worrying.

-DCK: tolerable tiredness, more or less like ephenidine.

-2-oxo-pce: clear hangover for 2/3 days: tiredness, low mood and emotional coolness.

I conducted some more experiments yesterday with O-PCE. 10mg orally, followed 1,5 hours later by 7mg rectal dose. I don't think I'm missing that much MXE (my introduction to this new bright world of ACH (arylcyclohexylamine) ) anymore, as this compound has  the same magic, but in a form that is both regal and wild. This "magic" must be a property of the pce molecule, as it is lacking in pcp, which has no similar "magic" but instead a "light", a power of its own. 


As for PCM, I would not go so far as to call her a peasant <grin>, but it is true that there is not that much profundity, not at least on the dosages that I employ (I have experience with O-PCM, which I liked, and ketamine, which I don't like that much). I only use what might be called psycholytic doses, the idea is to get as high as possible without impairing speech and motor coordination to a such degree that it becomes noticeable to others.  


Rectal works very good, as with mxe, there is a very pleasurable rush where your brain melts with happiness of being just where you are, and whatever it is that you're doing at the moment. (In contrast, with 3-MeO-PCP there is hardly any rush, instead it seems to work as if from below to above, in more slow and mysterious manner, and the effect is much more spread in time.) As with other ACHs, once the feeling starts to plateau and you begin to suspect that your latest series of world-changing epiphanies might have been a little more chemically enhanced than what you suspected only an half hour ago, there comes a temptation to redose immediately, but thus far the desire to preserve the magic has prevailed over greed. 


After 9 hours had passed, I decided to try a combination of 2 mgs of AB-FUBINACA oral with 6 mgs of O-PCE rectally. Once the O-PCE rush subsided and the fubinaca started to take over, things were very weird for some time, and I felt I was definitely getting near of the limits that I described, namely reality started to liquify a little too much at the edges, so this combination is definitely something that is better explored at nighttime in a reclining position with headphones on. All ACHs are greatly amplified by cannabinoids, and one can have a real trip on very conservative doses, and this was no exception to a rule. This time I played my guitar for a long time, coming up with motifs and sequenced that moved me to tears with their beauty.


I can't wait to get around combining O-PCE with 3-MeO-PCP, to me that sounds like an alchemical wedding!

Once the O-PCE rush subsided and the fubinaca started to take over, things were very weird for some time, and I felt I was definitely getting near of the limits that I described, namely reality started to liquify a little too much at the edges, so this combination is definitely something that is better explored at nighttime in a reclining position with headphones on. All ACHs are greatly amplified by cannabinoids, and one can have a real trip on very conservative doses, and this was no exception to a rule. This time I played my guitar for a long time, coming up with motifs and sequenced that moved me to tears with their beauty.

I'm pretty sure it is. In case of MXE, rectal is almost as powerful as intramuscular, and it seems that O-PCE shares the same property.


With all ACHs I've tried, oral, taken into empty stomach is by far the best ROA, with rectal as good second best option. Intranasal/sublingual filter out too many "frequencies", resulting a little more than a heady fizz. Or so it feels to me.

I agree with you more or less, oral is by far my favorite ROA with MXE.  But I tend to like 3-MeO-PCP nasally because I use it in low doses and I like the stimulating properties.  It's more dissociating orally for sure, but I like to use other things for dissociation.


I think I'll try O-PCE soon, looking forward to it, it sounds nice.  I actually have a tiny bit of MXE and I used like 20mg orally last week, wow, now I remember why MXE is the best.  It's just got that magic feeling.

Getting some O-PCE soon. Hopefully ALD-52 as well if I have enough money. I can't wait! I love what haltia speaks off. It's so beautiful IM'ing things like this and MXE. It's like the ultimate feeling of contentedness. Bliss just washs over your entire body. I'll have some nitrous and JWH-122. I'll most likely IM 10-15mgs of the O-PCE, then 5-10 minutes later take a blast of 122, and then do some nitrous. Super excited! It's been a few months since I've IM'd any disso. I know I'm going to melt into my seat with bliss. Can't wait to get weird and traverse the cosmos of my mind with some good music plus friends! I'm in need of this!

Help, if you have the disso perma tolerance 10mg won't do much for you. I can't remember for sure but I think my dose was 30-40mg and I felt like I could easily take it higher. 

10mg is probably a good place to start though.

Yeah I was thinking about that. I am IM'ing it though. I was leaning more towards 15 honestly. I'm not to sure where my tolerance is at. I know it's probably still pretty high. I'm going to be vaping cannabinoids and I'll have 500-1000mgs so it's not a problem. If it's not enough I'll wait a bit and move on up. My go to dose for IM MXE was 80-120 mgs so I'm sure it won't be a problem. I've also done O-PCE before a few times. What was your ROA Del?

Niiice. This is the kind of hole I always try to achieve. I feel like really good holes, on good dissos like K or O-PCE, are extremely similar to DMT flashes. I only have a couple of friends who have agreed with this analogy, but I think it stands.

I feel the same way. Thankfully, I have very limited experience with what I consider to be "bad dissociatives." I place DXM and methoxphenidine in this category. I suspect PCP (and its most closely related analogs) would also fit in there, but I have never tried it, nor had the opportunity to. As much as I loved MXE when it was readily available, it seems like kind of a not-so-great disso in retrospect. It was lots of fun, but I think it had more in common, in terms of effects, with DXM/MXP than with K/O-PCE.


Definitely the arylcyclohexylamines have a certain magic about them. Like you said, especially the PCE analogs seem promising on the whole. But everyone is different, and everyone likes to trip/dissociate differently. There's no accounting for taste, especially for disso fans who don't like to hole (wtf?!).


Also, thank you for the report, extremely interesting combo. I've never combined dissociatives before; I guess I've been wary of excess confusion and lack of synergy.

I appreciate and understand your concern. I didn't begin doing this until I was thoroughly familiar with O-PCE. And if I felt I had a dose that seemed more potent than normal, I would definitely keep myself planted. I certainly would not try to do this under the influence of K.


Thank you, though; I didn't mean to encourage any harmful activities.

Interesting. I think I tried one oral dose of MXE, way way back in the day; I don't really remember the effects. I also more than likely redosed intranasally within an hour or two. I've read interesting reports of oral O-PCE experiences here on Bluelight; I just feel like I have a stubborn side that's telling me I won't reach the hole with oral/nasal. I've never plugged anything. I'm not opposed to it, necessarily, but if I can reach the hole in another fashion, I'll take that option. However, all the talk of oral dosages has me wondering. Is there any kind of rush or intense onset with oral/plugged doses of dissos?

MXE is a PCE derivative - it is O-PCE with 3-MeO slapped on, so there is a very close relation. I would speculate that the 3-MeO group actually tones down some of the effect (magic of PCE)

There is no rush with oral, but you get a full-spectrum experience. It comes heavier and is in "technicolor". I wish I had better metaphors.![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


With O-PCE and MXE there is a beautiful rush when you take it rectally. Not so much rush with O-PCM and 3-MeO-PCP, but still you get a nicer and richer experience than what you get when you insufflate. My opinion only, and I'm not looking to hole. 


Also your stomach needs to be totally empty, morning is the best time. With rectal, evacuate bowels properly first.

I'm on the tail-end of my first real ride with this one and I've gotta say I love it. It's the first real taste of wonkland that I've had since MXE. I'd done smaller doses before, using as I do 3-meo, but not like this. Woah momma. 5-15mg plugged (all the powder that would come out at the time) and then maybe half the original amount 70 minutes later. Everything from holing to the fear to syncing up with alternate timelines and connecting to the source. This stuff is amazing.


My one addendum, realizing/connecting the dots after reading Haltia's post, is that this one is messy. It feels way more blaahwwahahwwh than MXE ever did so far as I can tell.

There is really no reason to inject it intravenously over intramuscularly other than the rush. You don't want to become too attached to any rush whatsoever because for most people things end up being all about the rush. It's tougher hitting your sweet spot with IV injections, amnesia becoming a more pronounced problem with doses being less forgiving. Just my experience. If you absolutely have to IV dissociatives, try preparing IM shots for consecutive injections because otherwise you WILL fuck your veins due to impaired motor skills and vision. That being said, there are few things that match the wonkiness of a dissociative rush. May not be as powerful as the psychedelics rush, not as orgasmic as that of MDMA and surely not as overwhelming as that of cocaine, but shit is it loud - You will hear the waves come crashing over you.

Yeah, fuck MXE. Never liked it as much as ketamine or PCP anyway. 2-Oxo-PCE however is the shit! I haven't done any PCP in years, but I would like to do so again to see if it still is as profound and lovely as it used to be now that I've met this relative of his.

To attempt a somewhat elaborate illustration - MXE is like a prim, pretty princess, all courtly manners, very sensitive to beauty and engaging in deep thoughts, an utterly magical and fascinating person to hang out with. 


Whereas O-PCE is the Queen Mother Herself, invested with tribal, archaic sacred powers, much given to throwing sumptuous banquets, long hunting expeditions and running an empire on which sun never sets.

Definitely. I was of the assumption there were no MXE-like compounds available whatsoever, nothing to even come close to replacing it, yet here we are and now I know. I'll definitely be stocking more.

This thread is encouraging. Like many, I've been mourning the loss of MXE. I tried 3-meo-pcp, but I found to be an incredibly poor alternative. Flushed the stuff, it was really dirty feeling. Yes, all drugs are different and I should never expect anything else to be just like MXE, but let's not bullshit things, many of are missing MXE and are longing for something that scratches that itch. 3-meo-pcp certainly did not. It sounds like 2-oxo-pce just might.


I've gone through, easily, over 500 grams of MXE over the course of a few years. It was the first and only time I found myself achieving a lot in life (fuck, I'm basically retired at this point in life thanks to the motivation/ideas it brought me). It was the ultimate teacher, a tool that gave me so much.


Question, can you redone on this one like MXE? I was accustomed to 5-6 redoses per night on mxe. Wondering if this one has the same qualities.

You will be running a high risk of suffering amnesia if we are talking hole doses. It's not easy to extend the hole without that happening, but it's possible. Just when you think your 2nd dose might be too low, cut it in half and you're good.

@send where is your tolerance to dissos right now? 500g sounds like quite a bit and I was wondering where my ketamine use bumped my tolerance. I probably used around 5g over the past 2 weeks and

I know I should slow down. But it's niiice :D

I can relate to that, as I too originally turned to 3-meo-pcp as a MXE surrogate and found out right away that it was altogether different kind of experience. However, if one reads a bit about it here and elsewhere, a pattern shows up; it takes a couple of trials for brain to get "used to it". It works differently from MXE, ketamine etc, as it seems to affect some "deeper" neuro-level, and unfolds from below, so to speak.


At first times I felt like a junkie forced to do with an inferior product, then I started to appreciate the still, almost atemporal quality of consciousness that it seemed to provide. I soon had a kind of spiritual breakthrough experience that was definitely aided by 3-MeO-PCP, and yet I believe it transcendended the usual mania-illusions that are the well-known effects of arylcyclohexylamines. After that I began to see these compounds as occupying the same lofty level as the classical "plant teachers", that is, I tend to picture them as entities with personality traits. Of course I might simply be starting to get unhinged ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) In any case I regard 3-meo as more powerful than MXE, and although it does not have the unspeakable sweetness of PCE-based chemicals, it has a light of its own and that light is partially present in MXE too.

3meo it's just not a poor mxe alternative, it's not alternative to anything at all. It's a different beast on its own, for totally different purposes.


Honestly, I don't miss MXE at all. Compared to 3-meo-pce, 3-meo-pcp, 2-oxo-pce or 2-oxo-pcm it was just a cheaper more recreative compound than any of those. Long life to the new dissos, people need to move on and forgot about dead past glories, fuck nostalgia.

I tried IMing eticyclidone last night. Muscles are a little sore. It's so much less forgiving than MXE. My last injection was around 9 PM, I blacked out / went catatonic until I came to at 3 AM. Was still disso'd out at work 5 hours later but thankfully was able to keep up appearances.   


Do not fuck around with the queen!


Muscles are a little sore today. Is that normal? I was using a 25g 1 inch needle.

Right now it's probably at nothing. My last run with mxe was a few months back, and even that was simply a recovered 300mg or so, which was about 3 doses spread out over one night. 500g sounds like a lot but when you spread it out over 4 or so years, its about 125g a year, or roughly 300mg/night. That probably still sounds like a lot, but to me it wasn't. I've experimented with 3-meo-pcp a bit but ultimately concluded it wasn't for me (just as some concluded mxe wasn't for them). I'm all about the hole, and the euphoric afterglow that even spreads into the following days. I know that's a trait of mxe (and mxm) that few other dissociatives can compete with, including 2-oxo-pce, but these benchmarks I'm looking for in a perfect dissociative aren't enough to dissuade me from seeking out new chemicals that could offer something even better, hence my curiosity with 2-oxo-pce. 


As it stands now, I still consider mxe the ultimate drug that has ever existed. That's not to poo on the personal preferences of others, it's just how I feel. Hopefully one day I cross paths with something that changes my mind.

IM onset tine?


Seems slower than mxe to me, which would make itself known after 5 to 10 min. Eticyclidone seem to have a gradual come up, not a rush, even via IM.

Never had any soreness whatsoever from 2-Oxo-PCE. In fact, I can't even figure out which site I used when I come back. Been wondering more than once whether or not I had more than one IV injection. Shit has to be really unhealthy for such a low dose to cause pain. I would assume it's impurities.

I have a bruise on my shoulder from yesterday, and there is a splotch of what could be redness or just bruising. Blood did come out when I removed the needle. None appeared when I registered, so I'm guessing I must have pierced a vein.


I'm kind of anxious about it, though. I'm hoping the soreness and bruise will be significantly diminished tomorrow.

Part of why this substance is so amazing to me is the fact that it requires a low dosage while hitting you like a train when IV'ed and being really smooth on the muscle from where it also elicits rapid action.

Favorite disso combo so far :


- low hole dose 2-Oxo-PCE at t+2h after snorting 10mg 3-Meo-PCE.


It seems low doses of 2-Oxo-PCE make light trips (with psychelics or dissos) MUCH more interesting without increasing the side effects to much

I would agree with this but I like IM 15mg eticyclidone repeated, and sublingual 15mg 3-meo-PCE.

I only take O-PCE and MXE rectally. I typically use 10-20mg O-PCE rectally and 20-60mg MXE. O-PCE dissolves readily in a boit of water, more readily soluble than MXE.


To me O-PCE is the only current dissociative that in my view can serve as a valid MXE substitute. It is rougher, more potent and a bit longer lasting. On a 2 day session I typically use either 250mg O-PCE as rectal 15-20mg doses or 500mg MXE as rectal 30mg doses. I consider both binge amounts to be roughly equivalent. I would never use 500mg O-PCE in 2 days but I have used 1gr MXE in 2 days. I find a 2 day binge ideal for these substances, you dose from noon to noon then drift off from non to midnight, at wghich point despite residual stimulation fatigue wins it and sleep takes hold.

This has been my fave between 3 meo pcp/pce and this. I think instead of 3 ho pce (reviews seem like a more expensive 3 meo pcp) I will just get more of this.


It really seemed to fuck with my UT system the most out of any disso I tried. So much so that dosing two days in a row wighout Olive Leaf Extract leaves me with urinary difficulties that ruin the trip.

I get insane urinary retention from this one. Like up to a day later. 


I also have a medical condition that makes me prone to it but with O-PCE it is still of note because it is so strong.

Recently I only snorted the doses, nevertheless had great results (for me) and no after effects, despite maybe insomnia and light mania the following days.


The strongest urinary difficulties I noticed with 2-Oxo-PCM (and maybe 3-Ho-PCE, but that it is a weird one anyway IMHO).

I really only can praise that substance right now, although in the beginning I talked it down (I was expecting a 3-Meo-PCP substitute).


It is incredible how fast it puts you in a hole and how well the short term after effects (insomnia, detachement, mania, minor concentration problems) can be controlled and even be enjoyable, because you can choose to a certain extend, how the reconditioning of your rational mind will be implemented.


With 2-Oxo-PCM for example the after effects take much longer (compared to the peak) and the benefits are basically non existent, because there was not really a reprogramming setting. Just a little hedonistic mind trip.


Not saying that 2-Oxo-PCE is the answer to all problems, but it can get really addictive to have a 100% proof non-monoamine wasting substance available, that provides a guaranteed escape from egocentric perception and associative thinking.


TLDR : I did not like it at first but now it is one of my most respected psychedelic tools.

I actually just read a study that says otherwise. Scientists have found out that 2-Oxo-PCE is in fact the answer to all of humanity's problems.

What is the physical appearance of this stuff? Would it look like little beige pebbles? I expected a pure white powder, crystalline/sugar-ish like 3-meo-pcp. Anyone ever received some quantity of 2-oxo-pce that was smallish pebble sized semi transparent beige pieces? Almost like molly without any of the pink hue. Any input would be appreciated!

Ive had. fuckdd UTI system since birth I think. I remember being 14 in school with a full bladder and not being able to pee. First discovered lean over and rest on wall trick. I think a lot has to do with relaxation, but something ib me was weird/narrow (cue Hank Hill urethre reference) way before I fucked with drugs 


Mxe outta all dissos was easiest on me. K bit worse tied with 3 meo pcp (days on end use). Then 3 meo pce. Not a superb drug and more problem causing UT wise.


2 oxo pce for whatever the fuck reason hates me. About this time last year there are probablg post from me on tge same subject. After the second day in a row it was hard to pee MDMA style during the trip then after not much better.


Spent a few days reading and trying shit. Olive Leaf extract is supposed to be good for persistent UTIS. Somsthing about penetrating biofilm in bladder and killingbacteria. Supposed to be taken with food  then two hours later take charcoal capsules to help soak up whatever bacteria is released etc. All I know is 2-3 caps extract can make me feel sick as fuck (with a wide open urinary stream) but the charcoal helps about 95%. Just a PSA for any lurkers out there. People wanna be ashamed fo talk about body healgh, but fuck it. We need to help each other because...


Yes I have gone to DRs. Multiple. It feels like it burns when I pee sometimes, and sometimes its hard to pee. Yes I had an STD test last month. What? No UTIS? You will send iff some bloodwork. Oh, nothings wrong with me.


Evenfually some specialist told me I had mild prostatis (aka annoying shit a large amount of men get/have Nd cant do shit about...supposedly) and a veracoscle (sp) on my left nut, which is also common. I told my brother and described the pain and the lok on his face... Hahhaa "Man i have that same shit". 


A bunch of money, run around and bullshit for "Yeah youve got problems, cant really do shit about em, yeah I know your young lifes hard. Want another prostate exam?" Now many a prostate rub like the PROs know how to do and we talkin...


 Just put it in Health Books. "Common embarasing shit you wont wanna get checked out but a lot of people get"

@yepyepwoah

Ugh I'm sorry man. It's crazy what kind of strain on our body we tolerate just to get high. Ketamine is one of the unhealthiest drugs of abuse there are, I dare say the unhealthiest of the popular ones safe for alcohol.


Funny post though! :D

It was love at first gulp? (I think I tried oral first) here.


From the structure I was expecting something hole friendly (notice how the hole friendly achs have a 2'oxo part) and relatively strong which is exactly what I got.


2'oxo-pcm just doesn't do it for me...... I get a slight dissociative buzz but it never gets much farther, thought it was a dose/tolerance thing but taking more didn't improve it by much and other dissos affect me at normal doses so my tolerance can't be that fucked up. Oh well, to each his own, right?

Mine was always very white (much whiter than 3-meo-pce/pcp, dck, mxe, ...), the powder was very fluffy and didn't stick to anything nor form clumps. It definitely didn't look crystalline like 3-meo-pcp/pce/dck/mxe/3-ho-pce. Have you ever seen a-pvp powder? Now imagine that but much whiter and not prone to sticking to everything. Idk it's kinda hard to describe, but it definitely looks different than most dissos.


Btw does mixing this with 3-meo-pce (especially at low doses of each) remind anyone of mxe?

I was wondering if mixing the two would be reminiscent of MXE.  I find 3-MeO-PCE to feel very much like that sort of base, underlying feeling on MXE, the part that comes through to feel enabling and sociable, usually from lower doses.  Haven't tried O-PCE yet though, but I want to, sounds great.

I've always had difficulty peeing when not relaxed or if people were too close to me, and also I've always had to pee more often than most people.  Dissos have never given me additional problems, but on serotonergic stims, it's crazy, really hard to go, and I have to go a lot more often.  Also, alcohol, especially beer, makes me have to pee so fucking much, it's so annoying.  If I drink fast, it's like every 10 minutes, no joke.  It doesn't make it hard to pee at all, just the volume.  It's weird too because it will be a lot of pee every time.

Mixing o-pce and 3-meo-pce kinda sorta maybe feels like mxe if you stick to low doses imo. But it's not a replacement for mxe, hell I prefer o-pce to mxe (not that mxe is bad but I just like o-pce more).


Speaking of peeing I haven't really gotten any such issues from dissos, but I do have that whole can't pee in front of others thing (unless really drunk/benzed out/on ghb then I'll piss anywhere and probably regret it later) which is really annoying sometimes... like when you have to pee for various medical exams and such (no nurse I'm not holding it in just to annoy you.... I you want this done fast go grab me some beers and benzos). Luckily my bladder can hold a lot of liquid so......

Yeah I've had times where I had to pee SO BAD but the only option was an open area and I couldn't do it (there was this one venue/bar that only had a single men's room downstairs and not only did the only stall have no door, but the bathroom itself had no door and was right by the entrance.  Really weird.  They had a second women's bathroom upstairs that was rarely used so me and my friend would run in there to pee).  If I get drunk enough or on 3-MeO-PCP sometimes I reach a place where I don't give a fuck and I can pee in front of others.  My theory is that I got picked on in grade school in the bathroom a lot, and it made me start using stalls, and then they'd all make fun of me for using a stall.  Banging on the walls, calling me a girl, etc.  Kinda traumatizing, leaves an impression.

I also have a nervous bladder, Xorkoth. Pretty much everything you've been saying I can relate to. For me though there's definitely a threshold I cross of how bad I need to pee where if I need to go bad enough, I can go anywhere, privacy or drugs be damned.

Short from sending in a sample for testing, what ways are there to know the difference between 2oxoPCE vs 2oxoPCM for someone who has tried neither? I have some o-PCE to test but it comes from a vendor who, at least once in the past, has acknowledged to accidentally sending someone DCK instead of o-PCE. I'm curious to try either chem so, regardless of which one this is, I'll be ok with it - just wondering what I should look for. I'm very experienced with MXE at high doses and some brief 3-meo-pcp experiments but have never tried either 2 oxo PCE or PCM. Thanks for any help.

o-pce is much more potent (plugging 30 mg is almost guaranteed to cause a hole unless you have a lot of tolerance), o-pce isn't caustic at all while all dck I've touched was somewhat painful to snort, o-pce lasts a bit longer and the feeling is not the same (but since feeling is highly subjective this doesn't really help you... dck for me always feels like just short of actually getting somewhere and o-pce is like dck on steroids that actually reaches that place but a lot of people enjoy dck so....), they don't look the same (o-pce is whiter and fluffier while dck is more tan and crystalline), the melting points are highly unlikely to be the same but I doubt you have the equipment necessary for a melting point test


short of a lab test or someone who has tried both trying it and telling you that's the best you can do imo

This shit made me sleep through my alarm when I tried it, as in my alarm was going off for 6 hours before I woke up. maybe I did too much and hit full blown anesthesia, I generally don't get this effect from dissociatives though.

When I tried the combo 3-ho-PCE, 3-meo-PCE, 2-oxo-PCE I basically lost 2 days without much recollection. (got a few days off work) But I felt great afterwards (and I guess also during the trip, nothing broke, nothing bad happened).


Being able to sleep a lot is a big privilege after experiences with (individually adjusted) high doses of those drugs. It should be part of the resetting process. It is essential imho. Hence no workday fuckery for me, unless I can shit on my job. ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

That doesn't mean you don't have O-PCE and have DCK necessarily. The O-PCE I have is tan/yellow and crystalline. There's different batches of everything going around, appearance means nothing if comparing to another chemical.

you can just feel the difference. small insufflated doses feel completely different. dck is rather weak.

I actually don't insufflate anything and prefer oral. I'll try 15mg and see.. I'm guessing very weak effects @ 15mg would indicate DCK, whereas more pronounced effects at that range would indicate o-PCE. Guess we'll find out.

I've yet to try O-PCE (that will change very soon), but O-PCM/dket is much milder in my experience than mxe, in terms of mental effects and euphoria. While some of the classic dissociative effects can be found, it doesn't check all of the boxes that mxe does. A 15mg dose of dket will likely be more notable in a physical sense than a mental one, but still relatively functional.

DCK is the worst arylcyclohexylamine I've done. (I've tried 3-meo-pcp, 3-meo-pce, o-pce, pcp, dxm, ketamine, dck. Missed out on the MXE wave, wish I'd tried it but good for my life overall taking a long break from dissociatives.) I also like MXP better, although I had a semi-violent response to that (making death threats, didn't lay hands on anyone however.) It is better than diphenidine.


So out of all the dissociatives I've done it is second lamest. I think you will like O-PCE, I can't fuck with it because (as posted here) it made me sleep through alarms which I dislike, I generally have something to do during the day.

I actually rather like DCK. As a full on dissociative experience, it definitely leaves something to be desired. But as a low dose near - daily, occasional moderate dose mixed with weed and good music, I've found it to be just right for my lifestyle - at least as much as incorporating dissociatives into one's life can be. I should say though that by the end of a week of regular use, the delusions begin to crop up and I've got to get down on myself a bit to discontinue use for a while.

Also it's worth mentioning, to date my fondest experiences of any dissociative I've tried have been had with MXE. I was binging through 5g bags with 1-2 month breaks in between for 2 years, so I'm pretty familiar with the range of effects. If you ever get the chance, I definitely recommend getting a stock of it. Just, you know, be more careful than I was with it.

I can get it at (edited for price discussion,) don't know purity or anything. Have you ever tried ketamine? That is cheaper (per gram.) Or other dissociatives for that matter (to compare it to.) 


I'm interested in it but that price is so much more than I used to see it not sure I want to pay (I'm aware it has become vastly more difficult to source.

Ketamine, for me, is one of my least favorite dissociatives. I rank it above dxm... It is enjoyable but with my tolerance, chasing anything worthwhile is prohibitive, so it usually amounts to impulsive lines that just put me out of it for an hour. For me, ketamine becomes pretty expensive very fast, and unless I combo it with a psychedelic, pretty lackluster and very fleeting. 


With LSD it is nice, but MXE & LSD is exponentially more rewarding.

Take it easy, I quit quite a while ago and I still have spots that don't fully stop scabbing and causing trouble, with plenty of the rest of my nose feeling just dry and eroded. I should do nose washes more often and apply some moisturizer.

I got some pure glycerin - probably best to mix it with vaseline but that shit will put a stop to such dry spots...


Got the glycerin for cryo storage of cultures, like champagne or bear yeasts... ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)

Vaseline really shouldn't be used on skin/orifices, especially on open "wounds". Parrafin oil is not agreeable with biological organisms, no matter what companies may say. If I remember it's an endocrine disrupter as well as affecting other systems as well.

Mine comes in fat crystals and the dealer has some NMR results on his site (tired of calling them "vendors"). Pretty sure it's the real deal. I just received 2g and it came as a single big fat crystal.

Well if you have a tendency towards atopic dermatitis which is very common, then lotions containing mostly glycerin, vaseline and paraffin have been proven to work very well in keeping the skin moist. Still shouldn't be used excessively on mucosal membranes.


The thing is, you may very well be right (got a journal article? I'm curious), but even if this happens to a clinically significant degree those are still just side effects, but those substances will still keep the skin moist. 

Millions of people take topical corticosteroids periodically which surely has a profound effect on endocrine functions and fucks with the skin big time (at least where applied, but some enters the blood, too) . Still these patients will usually be very grateful they have corticosteroids available to them.

Taking any type of medication or even ointment is usually a trade-off between getting symptom relief and suffering side effects. That being said, there isn't much else I can think of that Solipsis could do.

30mg of this motherfucker taken at the same time of 4 lsd blotters knocked me. I blacked out for 4h with amnesia, don't remember a fucking thing but I didn't moved from bed or that seemed at least.When I came out from the blackout I was left with some hardcore lysergic experience very maneageable, without anxiety and a lot of OEV and CEV. I wish I was able to remain conscious on the peak, that should had been amazing. Will try a lower fose of the 2-oxo-pce next time.

I love to read your posts treezy, but you have to be careful man. Get rid of the overboarding anger issues (had them myself, even without drugs, but not that escalating), before you take uncontrolled doses of those types of drugs (or any drugs). Battle someone stronger than you soberly or something that has not so much pain conscience (like trees) instead of bullying around sheeple, even if they provoke you.


Otherwise it can end bad for you and the provoking person and you both dont want that. Anyway your posts are very entertaining. ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

Do you find this info accurate? Is 2-oxo-PCE really that much of a stimulant?

That info doesn't seem to be accurate. It's more like the phenidines precisely because it's on the sedating side effects, but not at all stimulant like 3-meos. It doesn't cause amnesia at normal or hole doses, I only blacked out once on the substance and because a high dose mixed with lsd and a lot of ketamine and 2-oxo-pcm before the pce.

It's from here: [https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2-Oxo-PCE](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2-Oxo-PCE)


Anyway, I went super cautious and took 5mg (orally) just to see what I was working with. Very light, but enough that I can safely discard any worry that I had DCK instead of o-PCE. I'll try 15mg tomorrow evening.

The thing is, that DCK orally is much stronger than insufflated (subjective perspective). So this approach is not as reliable as you think it is.


Better approach would have been :


- 1st day allergy test of 1mg insufflated

- 2nd day small/medium dose insufflated of 10mg wait for 1 h what happens (not so much with both substances, but the motor impairment should be much more pronounced with 2-oxo-PCE)

- 5th day big insufflated dose (20-30mg) and lay in bed, if you hole then it is certainly 2-oxo-PCE, if you just notice a big enhancement in mood, then it is probably DCK

That's really dependent on what your intentions are. If I want to hole I would go for 2-OxO-PCE/PCM. If I want to be functional, I would choose 3-MeO-PCP/PCE.

Do people really find the phenidines to be sedating? I've only tried ephenidine but it was the most stimulating disso I've ever done, with the possible exception of 3-MeO-PCP (my experience with that was too long ago to accurately compare).

I still have to try ephenidine, I've got half a gram since some months, but everytime the disso cravings get me, I never thought about it and instead take some of my beloved 2-oxo's or 3-meo's. 


But diphenidine is sedating and amnesic as fuck. MXP is more stimulating than diphenidine, but I still put it in the sedating side of effects, specially comparing it to the available ACHs.

Man I have about killed this 500mg in 2 weeks basically just snorting it. Ive eaten a few doses and plugged a few doses (w/ psychs 2-cc OH MY GOD). Its a little bit stimmer snorting but not as much as I remember. I like this 500mg way more than the first 1g I got. That was from a US reseller, bc as far as Ive seen only one company has had legit O PCE. His O PCE  was legit and part of his stock list made it obvious he was reselling...


Anyway. About a year into production I seem to like this chem more. Maybe its just me, I dunnno. Ive gone into some nod like opiate hole things, but no real mxe/k type hole. Havent dosed above 15mg at a time either tho.

3 meo pce is stimmer for sure. A gram dissappreared on me in like 3 weeks I was like wtf? I would maybe get it again before 3 meo pcp (have too much and dont really like it). When I got it, was closer to 3 meo pcp $ than OPCE $. Dude said China made a big batch so I dunnom wasnt really a fan my $$$ will prolly go to K and opce


Yah o pce is more prone to putting you out so 3 meo pce prolly  better for you.

I look forward to adding my experience in a week or so.  I seem to be in a minority of people here in that I did not like MXE...or rather I found it pretty lame compared to 3-MeO-PCP and Ketamine....no other dissociative experience, still have not tried DXM.  Sounds like oral is the way to go...though obviously I'm gonna IM it at some point...not much of a IVer, snorter or plugger.  Anyway, nothing more to add other than I am excited to get to try this soon  ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  Yay!

well, just different strokes for different folks.  I find 5-MeO-DMT and ibogaine the holy grail of grails, but many find both difficult and arduous.  I love 2C-T-7, but others like 2C-T-2.  I find phenethylamines on a whole to appeal to me more...others find them shallow and prefer tryptamines.


I never got to experience MXE in combination with a psychedelic...but I am sure it would be a grand experience.  All in all, MXE was a pleasant drug but I found the M-hole to be absent much of the useful content that I find in a k-hole.  And it had none of the superman dopamine stuff I enjoy 3-MeO-PCP for.  On the other hand, I'd be glad to reevaluate MXE should I ever come across it again.

Yeah MXE with psychedelics is incredible... IMO it's the best to combine with most psychedelics of any disso (that I've tried).  The exception is LSD (and probably other lysergamides)... I find that 3-MeO-PCP combines the best with that.


I love MXE personally, more than ketamine, I find the holes to be similar except MXE maintains more of a connection to the self and the body.  But it goes to similar places for me, in fact my best hole experience reminded me of all these moments I forgot from previous K-holes.  The main drawback of ketamine, for me, is that I find it quite amnesic at high enough doses for a full-on hole experience, I never remember very much of it.  Plus MXE has this additional psychedelic/colorful quality that I love.  I have a tiny bit left and I save it to use as a launching pad for psychedelics, most notably tryptamines which it combines incredibly well with.

LOL DPT + MXE (or most any disso I imagine) is a direct-injection of comical cosmic joking, a salivating drool of spiritual salvation on the etheric-all plane. 

To ' that guy' that didn't like MXE, every time I hear someone say that I have to chime in my experience, that half the batches I researched didn't strike my fancy. Also set and setting are a thing. I've had great experiences on sub-par batches just because I was doing the right thing and in the open mindset, but those batches in the middle of the ratings are a little harder to work with overall. The batches on the lowest end were void of value for almost any application.


Sorry for off-topic'ing. O-PCE is a winner in the good batches but also seems to be susceptible to the weird variables of other arylcyclohexylamines. I have heard from many people recently combing O-PCE with 3-MeO-PCE is a quality combination. The 2 3-meo-pce batches tested were quite different comparing, the most recent one being that less expensive China crystal.

Agree with K+DPT.....probably the best combo ever....not counting LSD/MDMA.


Agree that ketamine can be amnesiac, and MXE was less so...I think this was why I found MXE lackluster at the time....I was expecting something as cosmic and out-of-body as ketamine and MXE did not offer me that.  I have no idea of the quality but it was an early batch, or one of the first batches to be released commercially.  I know many other BLers at the time were using the same source and enjoyed the same MXE I found lame....so I dunno about the quality but I think it was pretty good...since it was the same stuff everyone else was doing back then.


Obviously quality can vary from batch to batch...I've noted this with 3-MeO-PCP....I had some in 2014 that was mindblowingly good, potent, beautiful salt-looking granules, and literally made me feel like superman and I could do anything....2.5mg was enough to get a ++ and 12mg or so would give me a hole, where I was taken to the gears and grinders of existence, where everything is unwavering and unchanging, and "this" reality was just a figment of the mind....constructed to provide amusement from the boredom and unchanging existence of the gears and grinder world.


  I've had samples of three other batches of 3-MeO-PCP since then and none of them gave me the superman thing, none "looked" as clean (yes I know that means little, just saying)....and I could not reach the same 'hole' with 12mg.


So yeah quality varies but I know I had a very early and (I believe) good batch of MXE....and just did not care for it.  Only bought the one gram and never got it again....except a few odd samples from friends in 2014...same time I was into the (awesome) 3-MeO-PCP (peace be upon you), and still found MXE to not be the holy grail of dissociatives for myself.


Ok, I am rambling too, it is nice to be on a PC where I can really type, so I am enjoying the ramble....usually only a kindle and it is not so fun to ramble.

Glad to see you being able to ramble again. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


Yeah everyone is different.  My good friend hates all dissociatives, he hates the feeling of being dissociated and will turn them down every time (well the first few times he didn't, and that's how he determined he didn't like them).  I have never had a good experience with DCK, but a lot of people really like it.  I mean it wasn't bad, but was just boring and content-less, and lingered on annoyingly long.


I'm kinda curious to try diphenidine and especially ephenidine.  Just because, different class of compounds, that interests me.  But honestly I don't like getting strongly dissociated very often at all, the last time I went for a hole dose of anything was like 2 years ago.  I use 3-MeO-PCP regularly but only because I use tiny doses to give me that stimulation/inspiration, I ideally avoid the dissociation part of it entirely.

My good friend hates all dissociatives, he hates the feeling of being dissociated and will turn them down every time (well the first few times he didn't, and that's how he determined he didn't like them).  I have never had a good experience with DCK, but a lot of people really like it.  I mean it wasn't bad, but was just boring and content-less, and lingered on annoyingly long.

But honestly I don't like getting strongly dissociated very often at all, the last time I went for a hole dose of anything was like 2 years ago.  I use 3-MeO-PCP regularly but only because I use tiny doses to give me that stimulation/inspiration, I ideally avoid the dissociation part of it entirely.

Some people can't enjoy the void, I'm the opposite myself, I love to be able to leave my racy mind behind and enjoy the fade to black. I fucking hate stimulants and that's the class of drugs that many people seem to enjoy. I'm just tired from myself and suffer from insomnia so taking stims is asking for troubles (Except my daily low dose methylphenidate that makes wonders with my ADHD)


About MXE+LSD, I loved it even more than with 3-meo-PCP. Crazy OEV potentiation. 2-OxO-PCE goes very well with any psychedelic as well, the best disso for combos IMHO. I was a big fan of MXE back in the days, but I don't miss it at all, we have got a fucking huge spectrum of novel dissos to keep researching ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


Diphenidine, MXP and ephenidine worth to be tried for the sake of the novelty, but I won't spend money on them never again, they are very cold, disphoric and amnesic.


Back on topic, my 2-OxO-PCE stock is starting to get low (And by low I mean I've got 3g left, I start to get anxious when any of my favourite dissos reaches the "I still have got powder for another year at least" mark since the China ban). I bought 5g last year from the first lab that brought it to us, and the quality couldn't be better. I'm worried now because I see there is a lack of stock everywere, just one lab seems to be pumping it out and the pricing is crazy... Also they don't ship to Spain. 


What the fuck are those chinese labs doing pumping out shit with names like 4-CL-PVP, mexedrone, or so many many crappy stims and emphatogens instead of making the good shit? I can't get it.

It's pretty crazy the drought has persisted. Must be at least a year now? Maybe more? Even crazier for a chemical that is still legal in many places. Whoever gets the first batch to return to the market is gonna make themselves very rich very fast. I'm baffled as to why the stuff is still nonexistent. And don't hand me that nonsense about how nobody knows about MXE. I meet random people all the time in the drug world who know of and love it. It's not nearly as obscure as people in the mxe community think it is.

The synth is extremelly complex, and after the ban chinese labs will refuse to custom synth it. It's also banned on some european countries, and when talking about labs that do custom rc synths they are not many out there. Labs in Nederlands are focused on trypts and phens for legal purposes, and MDMA, acid and speed for illegal stuff. Dissos don't get much attention.

Not many disso heads explore the RC market. Most of the ones I know think there is no world after ketamine. I even heard a few hard ketheads say that MXE was shit. Well no point educating who doesn't want to be educated.

Suppose the chinesse market has its focus on stims as probably the synthesis is cheap and easy. On top of that a stim abuser can consume amounts that are out of the reach even for the most deep disso lover. I stopped trying new stims myself. They are getting worse and worse.


Just remembered we are in the o-pce thread. I haven't tried it but I read that has some alarming lingering effects. Do you guys feel is much worse for your health than MXE? If you had MXE would you find any point in getting o-pce besides pure curiosity?

Well, this was nice. I took about 5 mg of this yesterday, maybe a little less. I wrote the following comprehensive notes about it in my phone:


2:25 - 5 mg 2'-Oxo-PCE

4:10 - Start smoking

4:30 - Boom, tired

7:15 - Mmm​

I dosed not very long after receiving this molecule, with my primary goal, other than just exploration, being to numb a toothache. This goal was achieved.


I was surprised by how hard I was hit by this dose, but that may be because I have no idea what to expect from arylcyclohexylamines as my only experience with them before this was a high dose of ketamine once half a decade ago while already on a psychedelic. I have used other dissociatives, but just DXM, memantine, and nitrous oxide. This was not overly similar to any of them, though it did share qualities with all of them.


I very much enjoyed the high, which peaked for only a couple hours but then left me still feeling pleasant and pain-relieved for the entire rest of the day. There was no discomfort other than a slight queasiness when moving too much during the peak. As indicated by my notes, I smoked some cannabis a couple hours into the experience and this both increased the effects and made me feel heavier. I could see how this might enhance its hallucinogenic effects at higher doses, but at this dose I think I liked it better without the cannabis, it took away some of the fun energy and drunken feeling. I did however experience another slight boost of energy some time after the primary effects of the drug wore off.


Notably, while I felt great the whole rest of the night until I went to bed, I had a somewhat restless sleep full of bizarre and sometimes violent dreams. My dreams are already pretty crazy though so this may have just been a general consequence of lingering manic stimulation. Also it's worth considering that multiple people in the household including myself woke up with problems like diarrhea, so there may have been something else sinister at work there....


Other than that I'm still feeling good today, mostly in an afterglow kind of way. I'll definitely take this stuff again at a higher dose, though not without proper planning, as even this was already getting a little confusing during the peak.... Definitely not something I intend to take lightly before I have more experience with this class. But certainly something I am excited to get to know better. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

If MXE was available I would still bought it just for replacing 2-oxo-pcm. I used MXE for chilling and soft experiences and since the ban   I replaced it with 2-oxo-pcm, but it's a shittier compound compared to MXE. 2-OxO-PCE is still my favourite disso and if I needed yo choose between it and MXE my money would go to 2-oxo. Crazy potent and hole friendly, and better for psychedelic combos than MXE.


Intense experience for such a tiny dose Kaleida ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) but not having disso tolerance that's easy to understand. I had my ass kicked with 2-oxo-pce at 25-30mg and I suspect upping more the dose will end in blackout, and my permatolerance is insane. I suspect that 10-15mg will put you in oxoholeland for sure ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)

Suppose I was asking for someone to push me into the void. You both did a great job. I think I am sold. I am getting a very small amount of 2-oxo-pcm this week just because it cost peanuts. Probably 2'-oxo-pce would be next on the list. Truth is I cannot keep with the market.

I'm thinking about taking this again tomorrow night.... First time was a test and I had things to do, this time it'll the beginning of my weekend and I can really get into it. I'd love to see more of what makes this chemical genuinely powerful and not just fun. I don't really have much concept of how to work up with these molecules but I was thinking I probably won't go over 10 mg.

Hmmm, need to do more research I guess before jumping in.  So you guys are saying a cat and kitten like myself and Kaleida (with no dissociative tolerance) are gonna hole on just 10-15mg o-pce taken orally? 


 That is a hella potent compound!  Still cant wrap my head around the idea that these things work so well orally...been programmed to think you take your psychedelics orally (cept for base tryptamines of course) and your arylcyclohexylamines via IM injection.


I guess a equipotent comparison of oral O-PCE to an IMed dose of 3-MeO-PCP would be silly but feel free to do so!  The original 3MEOpcp from 2014 was 10x as potent as ketamine in my body....ie 12mg IM felt like 120mg ketamine IM (quantitatively... Not qualitatively)  ...though Ive been gifted two samples in the past year or so and they seemed maybe only 1/2 as potent as what I had 3 years ago.


Or how about a comparison of O-pce to a dose of ketamine?


Either way...I cant wait to try.   Haven't been so excited about a new substance like this in ages.

In my book the O-PCE high blows K out of the water. But the aftereffects are kind lengthy and I find it annoying, as apposite to the delicious afterFXs of, say, MXE.


10-15mgs is strong hole territory for a pair of cats without tolerance. You are going to deploy all the dimensions of the reality and a pair of new unsuspeted ones. Oh, sweet non tolerant pair of virgins...

Makes sense, well your judgment is pretty accurate. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) I ended up taking 10 mg with some cannabis last night and it was pretty interesting. It wasn't in a hole, but I could tell it was very, very close.


There was a slight but noticeable drop in the "wow" factor of the high from last time, but it should be kept in mind that last time was my first dissociative high in months and this was my second one in less than a week. Aside from that everything was stronger than the first time: more euphoric energy, more analgesia and anxiolysis, more drunken feeling, more desire to remain still with my eyes closed. I spent the first hour and a half waiting for it to fully come up and having fun listening to music, and as soon as I felt confident that it wasn't going to get any crazier on its own I went into my bedroom to lie down in the dark and smoke.


It still wasn't anything stable, which is why I say it wasn't a hole... but it was real. The first thing I recall is suddenly realizing that for a second I thought I was lying in a hot bath instead of in bed, that really tipped me off to my altered sensory perceptions. I also recall seeing some vague visual distortions in the dark that reminded me of my one experience with ketamine, mostly transparent, tiny trees with rainbow auras floating around like they were beginning to generate a landscape. After I let myself start zoning out and getting into the heavy feeling, I started getting more vivid, quick flashes of scenes for at least the next hour and a half or so, things that I didn't feel a part of but were so clear that I felt like I could have been standing right there watching them go down, if only for a second before they became nothing once again. Given that I'm not very familiar with this kind of state it's hard for me to pull any particularly significant distinguishing qualities out of these scenes, but what I will say is that I noticed that there was a slight hedonistic edge to them that was not unlike what I get with my favorite psychedelics, and that's what made me really understand their potential. Even just the hints of it were so appealing that at present I can't imagine myself ever wanting to take this drug for any reason other than to seek them out more fully, the high is nice but not nearly enough that I'd want to take away from my chances to experience more of that.


I pretty much just ended up lying there like that until I feel asleep without issue, and had a peaceful full night of sleep unlike my first one. This morning I feel slightly lighter than normal still, less burdened, but otherwise sober again.


Still not too much to say on this one yet, I'll write a fuller report when I've had a fuller trip... but it's definitely interesting. At this dose I found it very comparable to my one experience with ketamine (while already tripping), and less but still significantly so to my higher dose experiences with DXM. I am surprised to say that on the whole it was still tremendously different from memantine, because if anything I thought that this might be one of the dissociatives that shows me how memantine really does fit into the big picture after all, but on the contrary I'm now more convinced than ever that memantine is just unique. That practically feels like some kind of psychedelic-dissociative hybrid to me, whereas this just felt more like a dissociative likely to be enjoyed by psychedelic fans.


Anyway, smoking cannabis and listening to music is still a little nicer right now than it would normally be, so I'm going to go make the most of that. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Has anyone ever made a dosage equivalency chart for dissociatives?  In my own experience, I can say (for instance) that 12mg 3-MeO-PCP is equivalent quantitatively to around 120mg ketamine (when both are taken by IM injection).  It has been a while, but if memory serves around 50mg of MXE was equivalent to perhaps 100mg ketamine (both by IM).  Obviously, since many of the dissociatives are orally active, and since most people don't use needles, a chart may be somewhat hard to accomplish but I still think it would be an interesting exercise.

I've seen many people commenting about the long and annoying aftereffects of this disso. What exactly are you refering to? Is it that "mental impairment" sensation you get after, say, DXM ? Is it dizzyness? Long-lasting confusion ? Gastrointestinal issues ? Just a general uncomfortable feeling? Hangover ? Dehydration ?


And how long does the annoyance last ? Some people here have claimed that the after-effects are so long as to make this one unusable. But how long are we exactly talking about?

My dissociative tolerance is seriously fucked. Last week I IMed 35 mg of this and could still talk. And I know it wasn't bunk.

Well I haven't tried O-PCE yet, but I have tried O-PCM (also known as DCK) and I found that, after the first few hours of acute, desirable effects, I was left with this sort of "off" feeling, like still slightly dissociated, but no content to it, not really unpleasant per se but annoying because it was getting in the way of stuff I wanted to do.  This lasted for a good 8 hours I'd say.  I was barely able to sleep that night because of it, fell asleep around when the sun was coming up after laying there for a long time trying to sleep, and feeling tired, but just unable to sleep, and I took the DCK at like 7 or 8pm, can't remember exactly.


As for oral arylcyclohexamines... yeah, seems like many of them are best that way.  MXE for example, I've taken it orally, IM and nasally and oral is *by far* the best effects I've gotten from it.  It feels much more complete and warm and magical, and it's actually less potent nasally by a good bit, maybe equipotent by IM but qualitatively different.  3-MeO-PCP is also more potent orally than nasally and the only reason I use it nasally is because I like the less dissociating aspects of it more.

I find the undesirable lingering fx much worse with opcm than opce. I don't really notice them much with the latter tbh. Maybe I feel a bit foggy cognitvely after especially with large doses. But pretty much all dissociative do that to me.

So interesting oral would be stronger.  Ive not yet tried 3meopcp orally but did try a dose sublingual.... It was not stronger than a dose via IM injection...maybe only half as strong.


As stated earlier, I never much cared for MXE....but I always IMed it.  Maybe those of you who like it so much are basing it on a route of administration Ive not tried?


Fascinating sfuff.


I can say for sure with ketamine that no amount snorted could do what a standard 120mg in the arm or thigh would do... or not till Id get to 200mg anyway.

Well 200mg is a pretty standard dose for racemic ketamine, right? I started off with 250mg clean racemic ketamine per experience in 2004 or 2005 and never felt the need to increase that dose. Still it will never do what 60% of that amount does when I IV or IM it.

And neither ROA will ever come close to the magic of 2-Oxo-PCE. I was handed a vial of s-ketamine yesterday and while I did accept the gift and pretended to be happy about it, I am not excited at all. 2-Oxo-PCE is what it's all about now and ketamine is just... so fucking lame now. 


The only advantage ketamine offers over 2-Oxo-PCE, if you even want to call it such, is the short duration of action.

I dont really know to be honest.  Snorted ketamime twice (first two time) and my girl at the time was dispensing it to me.  Second time was a lot, easily could have been 250mg.  I holed but (as you note) it still never quite did what a full IMed dose would do.


Wow, you guys are sure making me excited to try this 2-keto-PCE.  ? 


Please Mr Postman look and see, is there a letter, a letter for me?  Ive been waiting an long long time for this dissociative to blow my mind!  ?

I injected 125mg s-ketamine this morning (sealed vial) and godamn was it boring. Ketamine isn't worth shit to me anymore, especially s-ket, not since I started using 2-Oxo-PCE. Oh and my unquenchable desire to use dissociatives was completely gone throughout the last month or two since I last used 2-Oxo-PCE. Ketamine will never get me to that point I want to be, it will instead just increase my desire to give it another and another and another try. So fucking worthless. It's also not nearly as euphoric as 2-Oo-PCE, not to me it isn't.


So many days you passed me by, see the tears standing in my eye. you didn't stop to make me feel better by leaving me a card or a letter.


EDIT: On the plus side, I couldn't have done this with 2-Oxo-PCE. I injeccted right after my wife left for work and had to pick up my daughter from school 5 hours later. I was fully sober after 4. Go me! Still a waste of time. There is absolutely nothing I gained from the experience other than a nice short-lived rush.

From my experience, and the dissos I tried, normal dosages without a lot of tolerance, and talking about snorting:


150mg K ~= 100mg 2-OxO-PCM ~= 75mg MXE ~= 25mg 3-MeO-PCE ~= 15mg 3-HO-PCE ~= 15mg 2-OxO-PCE ~= 10mg 3-MeO-PCP

You rock for that.  Wonder how many people even know of brilliant music like that anymore?  Wont say I should have been born in the 60s cause....well...no internet, no bluelight...but damn they just dont make (popular) music like that anymore.  Im sure there is plenty of great music now a days with lyrics such as that but....I sure as heck never hear much on the radio. If it exists, it must be obscure.


Its always fun at work playing for everyone Beatles and Velvet Underground and Jefferson Airplane and Dylan and Dead and Big Brother Holding Co and (all the good stuff) with some Ween and Radiohead and Gwar and LL Cool J and music from Gabon (iboga music) thrown in for fun.  I try n keep an open mind when its other peoples' turn to dj but lately I have given up, and put on my headphones for some talk radio nstead.  Guess Im a snob.


Ps, your talk about 2-keto-PCE is literally making me horny.

☺???????


Oh yeah, oh yeah.


Mr customs man thank-hank you.  For passing my letter on without further ado.   And Allah bless USPS, your tracking system is the best!


I just got the word today-a-a that my letter from so far away, is gonna be in my hand...it made it through to my home land.


So mr postman look and see if there is a letter, a letter for me?  Ive been waiting for such a long time.  For the chance to blow my mind!


I will exercise some self control and wait till saturday to warm my soul.  Responsibilities must come first, before the o-pce can be dispersed!


But when saturday finally arrives, I will no longer be deprived, from first hand knowledge of the effects, of the dissociative that crOOk says is the best! ?

Pffft.  Woke up from a sound sleep after a dream and typed that out.  Im a silly goose.


I just wanna know when the good music is gonna come back on the radio/be popular.  How long till the next Nirvana?


I think society as a whole suffers greatly when popular music is awful, a disaster, a disaster....believe me.  Its very, very bad,

very bad (sharp nasal inhalation).


Anyway, going off topic here as my koffee and exotic tree related to koffee kicks in.

No they dont...well 3meo *can* but that is why I said quantitative similarities vs qualitative similarities.   For instance....25mg of ketamine taken via IM doesn't make me hole...and 2.5mg 3meopcp taken IM felt very similar to that dose of ketamine...just lasted many hours instead of 45min...thus where I got the "3meopcp" is approx 10x the potency of ketamine.


Similar to a benzo equivalency chart.....xanax and valium dont feel anything alike...well they are different in action and duration...but you can say that approx 1to 2 mg of xanax is equivalent to 10mg valium.  Same principle would apply here.


Consider is advanced dissociatives musings.

I don't think there will ever be another nirvana. The music industry is different now. Now it's all about a variety of niches due to the democratizing nature of digital distribution. For thus same reason there will never be another Beatles.

There can never be another Beatles.... It is blasphemy to even think there could be.  The Beatles were sent by Allah to bring color to a very black and white world.  Their story is beyond the music.   But soooooo off topix...a mod is gonna spank me.

Hey @all!

I just wanted to chime in real quick, as I think this is pretty important in regards to harm reduction.

Generally, I'm more the thread-observer/reader type of person, and I've only started a few threads, then deserted them pretty much. So sorry about that!


On topic:

I have been researching this compound for actually a few months now, then paused a while, and recently got to try some more.

I'm on Buprenorphine maintenance therapy (8mg per day), and that is the important part:

I saw several posts in this thread where people complained of high blood pressure and similar issues. I had the exact same issue. I'm 23 years old, and when taking O-PCE/2-oxo-pce my blood pressure sky-rocketed to about 150/95 (which is regarded as hypertonia or high blood pressure). This got me worried since, even though I'm a smoker, and substances like this are bound to increase blood pressure by a bit, I thought this wasn't normal.


Especially since the dosages I took were rather small (upto 10mg). My friend (about same age) is experimenting with this substance too, and even though his blood pressure rose, it didn't rise that dramatically. He told me to calm down since he thought it was due to me being a smoker, and generally a nervous person.


Then I found this thread on bluelight: [http://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads/658561-Suboxone-Patients-at-High-Risk-for-Serotonin-Syndrome](https://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads/658561-Suboxone-Patients-at-High-Risk-for-Serotonin-Syndrome)


I'm **assuming **that O-PCE is a triple reuptake inhibitor (Serotonin, Nor-Adrenaline, and Dopamine). So naturally, taking this in combination with Buprenorphine (I'm taking Subutex, without Naloxone if that matters to anyone) will drastically increase the potential for **Serotonin syndrome**, a potentially life-threatening group of symptoms which occurs when you take too many drugs that directly, or indirectly increase your Serotonin-levels.


Just wanted to get my message out there. BTW, I am not a physician. This is purely speculation, but it makes sense to me. It may have been mentioned on this thread by other people, I'm not sure, since I obviously haven't read every single page.


So please be safe, guys!

P.S.: There doesn't seem to be a massive amount of information out there in regards to Buprenorphine and it increasing the risk of Serotonin syndrome. If anyone has any more info on this topic, please share it here, or on a more suitable thread (topic-wise)! ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


P.P.S.: I didn't mean to say that 10mg isn't a high dose, but compared to some crazy people on here (sorry! No offense) who took huge amounts, it isn't a very high amount. Peace!


P.P.P.S.: Sorry for the constant edits. Still a little bit manic, and keep forgetting important (I think) details: Apart from the high BP, I also experienced LSD/Mushroom-like hallucinations - Like my curtains were waving/moving (just like on Shrooms), even though the windows, and doors were closed; the heating was switched off, and I was lying still on the bed. That to me is pretty evident of a slight Serotonin syndrome. Am really impatient to read what others have to say about this.

I imagine 10mg would be a high dose for something without disso experience/tolerance when I can barely stay in this world with a 25mg dose with my massive permatolerance ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


You can tell from 3-meo-pce or 3-meo-2-oxo-pce (mxe) that there is for sure a lot of serotonin action going on with -pce like drugs.

That's why I really want to try base PCE, seems like it would be an incredible drug.  Never seen it available though for some reason.

When you guys say serotonin action....you mean because the drug's action on serotonin makes you *feel* serotonin effects?   Are these in the visual sphere or in the (spiritual) heart or body?

Sorry, but I don't really understand your question...


I just suspected serotonin activity because other similar substances (e.g. Ketamine) act as a serotonin reuptake-inhibitor. And the symptoms I experienced (pretty high blood pressure/vasoconstriction, visual hallucinations similar to LSD/Mushrooms/any 5-HT agonist, Tremor etc.) at least to me seemed to resemble similar symptoms to those experienced while experiencing serotonin syndrome.

Sorry. Yes, I agree. 10mg is indeed a high dose, especially for someone with no tolerance!

I was talking about the headspace and body feelings, that "everything is allright" chilly mindset with that warm bodyload compared to something like 3-meo-pcp, that feels that haves more dopamine than serotonin action. But if I remember well 3-meo had a high affinity  for NMDA but no so much on dopamine...

I always think it's hard to tell whether a subsance activates a specific type of receptor system stronger (or influences it in any way), than another substance.

Like for example how do we know, what pure serotonin action feels like?

Hope you understand what I'm trying to say. Didn't mean to offend or anything.


Edit: An example: Psychedelics like LSD or Psilocybin/Psilocin don't necessarily always leave you feeling a warm and comfortable body feeling, I find. The bodyloads can sometimes be very uncomfortable.

To me, it's pretty easy to tell when a substance is a releaser of something... for example, serotonin releasers feel very... a certain way.  However, it's not all so easy when you get into agonism/etc.  Most people (myself included) find 3-MeO-PCP to feel quite dopamine-y, but I believe it's actually doesn't act very much on dopamine.

Science told us MDMA keeps releasing serotonin until draining it at a hardcore style, so we can imagine what the effects of serotonin release might feel.


Also, about 3-meo-pce, we know (quoting from psychonautwiki) it has Ki values of 61 nM for the NMDA receptor, 115 nM for the serotonin transporter, 4519 nM for the σ1 receptor and 525 nM for the σ2 receptor. 


So we know 3-meo-pce at least is having some kind of action going on with serotonin. I can't find any info about Ki values for 2-oxo-pce, but I suspect it messes with serotonin a bit, and a lot with NMDA.

It's indeed a lot like a low dose MDMA body high when talking about -pce substances on the market. I could easily compare the body highs. A lot softer though.

That's true, I suppose. But MDMA doesn't just have an effect on serotonin release. That's just it's main pharmacodynamic profile.


But I admit, that I haven't really thought about differentiating serotonin agonists from serotonin releasers, which does make sense!


I know O-PCE acts as a serotonin reuptake-inhibitor, I'm assuming it's a triple reuptake inhibitor.

I guess, that serotonin releasers feel a lot different to serotonin reuptake-inhibitors, as well as different to serotonin agonists.

I've tried Venlafaxine (an SNRI) once, and it just made me feel really weird; very different from a Mushroom trip, or MDMA...


I also admit, that IME, O-PCE does share some similar traits to MDMA in the way that it feels, but I'd describe it more like a kind of dopaminergic/coke-ish feeling.


Edit: Apart from O-PCE, I don't have that much experience with Dissociatives except for Ketamine, Deschloroketamine, and Methoxphenidine. O-PCE to me feels a bit like a mix between Ketamine and Methoxphenidine, but there is something unique about it, just like with pretty much any substance imho.


I'm assuming O-PCE probably has a rather complex pharmacodynamic profile, just like Ketamine for example.

I did 500mg in the course of 2 weeks, ran out of the stuff the day before yesterday.

I took at least one dose every day, 2-3 doses per day regularly. My standard dose is 10mg 

either orally or rectally. 


The first batch I got was fluffy material, this one was in form of cloudy crystals. When I took 

this new batch couple of first times, I was disappointed. The experience seemed to take me into 

somehow neutral and anesthetized headspace. Where was the warmth and euphoria? It seemed almost 

like some other drug, but still I recognized the "signature" as belonging to O-PCE. Oh 

well, that's "batch polymorphism" to you. 


I remember coming across the same phenomenon with MXE, where different batches gave wildly varying effects, 

some being very mellow and euphoric, while with others the prevalent effect was kind of synchronistic magic

with meaningful coincidences. Some batches put me initially off, yet in the end I grew to like them.


Same thing with 3-MeO-pcp, which felt to me "meh" in the beginning, but soon I learned how powerful 

it was. So I persisted with this patch, and sure enough after few day's use it started to become hugely euphoric.

I wonder if there is some kind of learning process for receptors, so that they need to become "attuned" 

to the molecules, although this does not explain why the experience varies with the physical macroscopic 

form of the product.


I did not plan to use O-PCE so often. I confess that I have fallen to its moreish lure, it is so easy 

and tempting to turn an ordinary afternoon (or morning, for that matter) to a magical one, just whip out your scale 

and your bag of powder. The past week felt like a continuous slow binge. In a civilized culture, O-PCE (and the other ACHs) 

should be part of psychotherapists toolbox, or perhaps incorporated in some religious context (like ayahuasca) to ward off and balance

their negative aspects - addictiveness and tendency to mania. My worry is not addiction though - MXE played a 

great part for me being able to give up nicotine addiction that had lasted for 3 decades, and I'd rather be addicted to

arcyclohexylamines than to cigarettes again - but it's about getting too detached from reality, or more precisely 

the (rather drab and dull) reality that the majority of my fellow human beings seem to inhabit.


For my part I feel I've have almost lost fear of death, because I've seen how life and death are the two sides of one existence.

And we are all one, we are only having this grand masquerade, and will have it forever, because it is the point of the game we are having.

I have always been, and I will always be, and so will you, because our individualities represent eternal stations 

in the mind and body of the divine being. The other recurring Terence McKenna-like theme in my experiences is that some massive global

 change is coming and the emergence of arylcyclohexylamines are somehow closely connected with that - but I'm not that sure about whether 

this represents something real or manic delusion. But this "conviction" appears very regularly in my inebriated state. (On the other hand, it 

is trivially true that technology has massively changed the planet while giving us some interesting substances in the 

process.)


I've become more productive than ever, and have finally engaged in certain very ambitious creative project that my 

doubts in the past have prevented me from accomplishing, and this is all because of O-PCE which instantly detaches 

you from unjustified self-criticism.  Of course one needs not to act on impulse, because not all ideas you get while high 

on the chemical are good. Or more accurately, they are not realistic at the moment. But the energy one gets can be put 

into good use with some sober and rational thinking 


Will order more. And while wonderful things are happening I'm continually keeping watch for negative aspects to 

show up.

The main (only) source of this states an in house synth will be upcomming bc china cant seem to make or right. I copped two 250mg orders (came bagged sep. So I assume prebagging for ease of sale). Def. Seems a little different from the 500mg I got from them two months or so back.


Hope the inhouse comes through, hate to see this fall off like mxe

I honestly don't think serotonin syndrom is very likely to occur on this one. It potentially could, even buprenorphine on it's own has been reported to cause serotonin syndrome, but there are plenty of other explanations for rising blood pressure. Hypertension alone is not very selective for the phenomenom. If your pupils start twitching and your body temperature rises by more than 1°C you'd have a point.


However I have noticed that the visuals I experience on low to moderate doses are very similar to those seen on serotonergic psychedelics which I can not say about any other dissociative drug I've tried.


This is still the best dissociative I've ever tried. Not just breakthrough doses, but low doses as well which I don't usually enjoy when it comes to dissociatives.


Something noteworthy: I experience very intense open eye visuals on 2-Oxo-PCE, something no other dissociative has ever caused. If I keep myself from blinkin it will take a few seconds for my vision to become engulfed in a sea of quickly moving objects. It looks like I'm lying under a cherry blossom tree with the wind blowing through the leaves and flowers or butterflies covering my field of vision. Stunningly beautiful!!!

You guys are making me me drool.... I haven't gotten open eye visuals from this one yet, but I want to. I have only tried so many dissociatives but this was definitely the most impressive and psychedelic for me too.... My last 10 mg dose I would have guessed was just some new class of psychedelics if I didn't know what dissociatives were, not even just the subjective effects but even things like tremors and yawning while coming up. I'd really love to see an in-depth pharmacological profiling done on this one.

I would be suprised, if 2-oxo-PCE had significant affinities for serotonine-receptors. 3-meo-PCE for sure, though.

I very much doubt that either of them do based on past arylcyclohexylamine binding studies. I'm much more interested in seeing the ratios with which it binds to different NMDA receptor subtypes personally.

I got a new batch of this stuff. It's kinda beige/tan/yellow/offwhite and Sandy. Very potent though. I had a bad trip and semi blacked out. I thought I had a nightmare but nope. When I woke up everything was unplugged from my comp, my TV was on my bed (not damaged though!). I remember thinking I was trapped in like a crawlspace or something. But it was just a room in my house. I was feeling The Fear that night. Gonna have to be careful with this new stuff.

Ive had so many disso trips where i felt i became lost and traveled to another dimension. Like trapped in blackness forever and there is no way out you are waiting on rebirth. 


At this point I welcome them and ask to talk to any entities based off LOVE to see whats up. I just start chanting auuuuuuummmmmm, if you dont have love leave, hate is banished from here. If you wanna help me help others lets do it.


My balls have grown after so many of these type experiences. I do yoga, meditate, chakras etc. Usually do white light protection around myself three times. Rapid heart chackra breathing. Flood my room with light and basically Gandalf "YOU SHALL NOT PASS" negative energy thieves. After facing the same fear so many times ypu realize the only power the neg. energy/entities have is what you give them. 


Just start chanting aum at fucked up moments and concentrate on your heart and love and see how fast the negativeshit flees. Be forceful. Say fucj you, you have no power over me I am one, we are one, youre oneness is not needed fuck off..


Its amazing how the whole rooms vibes change when you assert yourself.


Death? I fear death no more than life. What do you have to offer or say. If ots not what I want BE GONE

I've given this chem about a dozen or so test-drives over the last few weeks and while it's probably the closest there is to a MXE replacement, it lacks the magic. I know people's feathers get ruffled when anything is compared to MXE, but if people are going to assert this is the greatest dissociative then it's only fair to share my opinion pushing back on that. Either way, everyone is entitled to their own opinions, but I feel the best batches of MXE are still head and shoulders above any other dissociative out there.. at least any that I've tried.


Come back, mxe. I'm tired of test driving inferior cousins.

yup, i got 4 of those 250mg baggies. I have another batch that is white and crystalline. some suspect it's not actually opce or that it's cut with DCK. I kind of like the fact that it's a little less potent because it makes finely titrating the dose easier. When I dip back into the tannish batch, I'll probably have to start with under 10mg and redose in increments of like 2.5 mg / hour until I figure out precisely what I'm dealing with.


It's hard to have the presence of mind to implement your advice when I'm so fucking gone. But I'll keep it in mind. Arylcyclohexylamines really are something else. It's amazing how broad the spectrum of affects of even the same compound can be.

I find O-PCE to be extremely recreational, except when I overdose. I just wish 3-meo-pce didn't take so long to kick in.


I keep on saying this, but combining O-PCE and 3-Meo-PCE really gives you the best of both worlds. Such an amazing combo. I like taking them at the same time because the O-PCE makes the time pass faster while waiting for the 3-meo-pce to kick in.


I wonder when we'll start seeing even more novel ACH's. The fact that bromazolam just came out gives me hope, that there is still interest in pulling a Shulgin and releasing new things.

Sober practice makes for ease of doing while fucked up. Even do a ten .inute meditatiin before you trip, white light yourself and room, and when bad times come.go back to that force.


2 years locked up gave me 7 days/week exp doing these things and the results are paying off


Seriousky, the easiest thing to do is chant AUM loudly wheb she gets sideways. Then verbally/mentaly yell "If you dont love truth, light, and love BE GONE". Work wonders. Ill even admit its hard to remmeber to do somethimes

Btw 20mg of o-pce taken orally before bedtime did not promote  sleep.  I was up for many hours but I enjoyed it.  I suspect that when IMed I will find my hole...and that it will not promote sleep.

I notice the exact same thing. No vomiting, but feeling like I will vomit. Kind of a queasy/upset stomach feeling, occasionally a mild pain but mostly just a 'something feels off/wrong' feeling.

No vomiting or gastrointestinal issues whatsoever for me. I used to occasionally puke on dissociatives though during my first few years, especially if I combined them with even the smallest amount of alcohol, say one beer.

That's awesome news man....glad domestication is working up good things for the psyche.


I must say, the one dose of O-PCE I had last weekend seemed to have a rather dramatic anti depressant effect upon me for many days.  It definitely broke me out of a rather dysfunctional place I had found myself in....and I had a sorta emotional catharsis the next morning.  Not saying I'm cured or anything, just that it seemed to give me some needed breathing room.  I didn't get a chance to try O-PCE via IM this weekend and too bad.


maybe the gods will let me have an acetyldelysid and ketopeace session next weekend when I visit the extended adopted family for the weekend.    Hmmm that would be stellar actually.

Hmmmm.   Well if 2-oxo-pcm is the "2c-d" of dissociatives, then 2-oxo-pce is the 2C-E.


All the information was there for me to know this could happen, sure its obvious combining high dosages of power dissociatives in a fragile mind can make it break.  Thankfully it ll came back together ok but...

Last nite I took a dose of 3-MeO-PCP (10mg, orally) and when I was not where I wanted to be I added 25mg 2-O-PCE (orally).


It took me to a place where I had at one point attempted to wrestle/tackle my sitter.  My sitter reports they had trouble restraining me at points, that I kept getting up, and that I was screaming.  In my mind it was a Christmas ww1/you have turned 40/you know where you were when kennedy was killed type of trip.....and I remember most all of it, but the dissociation was so strong that all the messsages were scrambled.  I suppose in a personal and shamanic sense I "got something" from the trip (namely that I am too fragile to keep playing with new drugs/might be time to move to the point C place in my life) but really this was an experience I will be glad to put behind me.


As the literature suggests...there is a distinct anesthetic action to ketamine where you are immobilized....not so with some of the PCE analogues it seems. This "hole" was the deepest I had ever gone with a dissociative, I will never repeat.  All of the bad things you hear about happening to people could have happened to me...thankfully I did not wind up on the streets naked but I now see first hand how that can happen and its not pretty.  :/


Maybe I can break the years long writers block Ive had, and make a proper trip report.


Careful kids with these things.

Wow man, I'm glad you're okay. ![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif)  This highlights the importance of having a sitter.  


I find that 3-MeO-PCP really blasts off other dissos to a tremendous degree.  I remember one time I had 2 5mg bumps separated by an hour or so of 3-MeO-PCP, and then I added 20mg of MXE, and then 20mg of MXE a bit later.  I was at a show, and I became utterly unable to understand what was happening.  Visually nothing made sense, I would look at what I realized was the stage after I came down some and it was a field of lights and shapes, the music I wasn't even registering as music, I had no idea what was going on, I just knew something was.  I remember after I came down a little, that this person I sort of know was talking to me but all I could do was give her the thousand yard stare, speech wasn't only impossible, it was unknowable.  I knew she was trying to communicate with me but it was just sounds.


Either of these doses by themselves is pretty mild for me, but combined... good thing my friends were there.  I didn't freak out or anything, I just had no idea what was happening or where I was.


Indeed, be careful with these things.  They're not toys for sure.

I don't understand why this one isn't more popular. I like it a lot more than DCK. I just took 30 - 35mg, with a little bit of 3-meo-pce on top (although I won't be feeling that for a couple hours). It's crazy how high my tolerance has gotten since I started fucking with this stuff. 20mg used to be enough to send me into a manic episode. Now I'm wondering if that 30-35mg will be sufficient, or if I'll want to top it off with 10 more mg once I start to feel it.


When my micron filters get here, I'm going to try something new: o-PCE and 4-aco-dmt together in one IM shot.

Wow MGS, sorry to hear about the fuck-up. 25mg is quite a hefty dose if you aren't very familiar with that place. Seen a few people freak out. I take roughly 25 IV or IM and it's about as much as I can take without blanking out. I would say 25mg is too much for most, especially when you combine it with 3-MeO-PCP. Come to think of it, that might actually be the reason why you lost your shit, not the dosage. Bit of both I suppose.


Anyway, did I mention this is my favourite dissociative in every respect? :D

this thread is a messy clusterfuck alphabet soup that is hard to follow. too many people mentioning their trips on other chemicals with similar abbreviated, hyphenated scientific names i can't really get a good idea of what this chem is supposed to do, or feel like. 


morninggloryseed says that this stuff is less sedating than K when it comes to hole dosages, yet a lot of people say that they like this much more than all other dissos out there, including ket. i personally find S-ketamine to be my favorite disassociative, so i would like to hear more from people who have holed on this stuff and how and why they find it better than K. this thread is 30+ pages of posts talking about how different this is from 3-meo-PCE/P/M/O-WHATEVER maybe has been great chit-chat for all of you, but it doesn't seem to be explaining that much to those of us who have not tried this chem out. 


it's intense, potent, not very sedating, I get it. but you can hole. and it's possibly more fun than ketamine. please go on. i'm listening. thank you.

So, I've been a ketamine user since 2004. I started IM'ing it in 2006 and have gone over to IV'ing it in 2014. I have used countless dissociatives excessively, a lot of PCP, some MXE, some DXM and a lot of analogues. usually IV'ed and almost exclusively at breakthrough-doses from day 1. For reasons that elude me I never developed a significant dose-dependent tolerance or an inability to experience nearly full sensory shut-down. In fact my experiences have become even more profound and spiritually stimulating.


I've used around 3g 2-Oxo-PCE so far spread out between the time of it's release onto the scene and today. When I first injected 2-Oxo-PCE and experienced a full dose I knew that I would lose interest in ketamine. I had said I would have found my favourite dissociative more than once in reference to other substances, but most of the time the euphoria quickly faded and I came back to ketamine. 

I've received free s-ketamine both in (seemingly uncut) crystalline form as well as in pharmaceutical aqeous preparations made for injection purposes since my first 2-Oxo-PCE dose. Every time I took it I found it completely lackluster. A fucking joke actually. Not worth my time. I'm not shitting you!


As for the pros and cons of 2-Oxo-PCE:


Pros:

It's extremely psychedelic and what I call spiritually stimulating - my religious beliefs have been developing at a higher pace. 

It's extremely euphoric especially at low doses, one of the most euphoric substances I have used (and I don't exaggerate when I say I've mainlined a very large number of them). 

It seems to be quite empathogenic and I have gotten extremely colorful OEVs from it a few times (which no other dissociative ever caused).

It's not significantly less sedating than ketamine, albeit very slightly so.

It lasts much longer than ketamine, abolishing the need for repeated injections.

It's active at a much lower dose than ketamine, possibly less toxic reducing the strain on the tissue I experience. Ketamine acts as a local vasoconstrictor and will often cause some ischemic necrosis for that reason. 2-Oxo-PCE injection sites do not even hurt .


Cons:

It's after effects can last more than a day. You really need time for this one, not any less than say for a DOC experience.

It causes heavy motor skill impairment, much worse than ketamine in my experience.

It can cause psychotic symptoms at higher doses more easily than ketamine. 

It's still slightly less sedating making it riskier.

It has a lower 'recreational index'. The ratio between a dose which will cause full amnesia and a dose that induces a breakthrough-experience is very low, slightly less than 0.8 for me. Compulsive redosers beware!


If you ask me a direct comparison to ketamine makes a lot of sense with this one, since they feel very similar. This one is so much superior to ketamine though when it comes to the desirably effect, at least it is in my opinion, but it requires much greater care and a lot of time to use it recreationally. I could get home after dropping my child off in school, inject a dose of ketamine and would experience no more effects by the time I headed off to pick her up. The endeavour of taking this one on the other hand needs a considerable amount of time dedicated to it.


Now why in god's name do you prefer s-ketamine over the racemic drug?


EDIT: I made a slightly angrier but very similar post to yours in the ETH-LAD thread to good effect. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


EDIT2: **It is everything I had ever hoped to find in a dissociative.** While the thought of it being outlawed in my country is very saddening and almost overshadows the joy of having found such a wonderful chemical, it also made me realize that we will keep seeing novel recreational drugs surface that are far 'superior' to those we know. At the moment the only use I have for ketamine is combining it with short-acting serotonergic drugs like MDMA or 2C-E. That being said, 2C-E combines extremely well with 2-Oxo-PCE as well.

With a long break in between doses you can take two hits and enter a DMT style 0-PCE level type experience and then that fades in twenty minutes to an average plus 3. Then 2-3 hours later you are down with way less effects on the stomach or urinary track. As far as harm reduction it is now one of the main way I use the drugs. I would like to IM this tan 0-PCE through a micron filter but wonder the safety of that as I have never used needles ever and always wanted to try IM ketamine but then sealed K vials from Mexico became more scarce. Safety for IM micron filtered 0-PCE or DCK. The IM DCK was something a friend wanted to try as I dislike DCK for the most part. I have not tried well made DCK base to be vaped off a glass pipe. The thing with smoking the base is more is required but heck for the hangover resulting from oral use and the stomach concerns it is worth it. Someone more versed in chemistry should come up with a really good tek. Mini AB maybe with lye or sodium carbonate then pulling with? VM&P would be my go to.

I've yet to IM the tan batch, but I should be getting more micron filters tomorrow. I'll let y'all know how it goes.


I've found the experience to be drastically different now that I have a higher tolerance. It's less psychedelic, less mindfucky, and more recreational. I usually dose between 20 and 30 mg orally.

Will be receiving a couple grams of this one. Can't wait! I want to combine it with ALD-52 and maybe 6-APB. Sounds amazing! MGS it was almost defintely the 3-MeO-PCP that caused your freaking out. I took a higher dose of 3-MeO-PCP, 10-15mgs, then about 50mgs of MXE, and then I proceeded to feel like I was going insane for two or so hours. It toned down around then though but for those first couple of hours it was insane. I'd never experienced something like that and it wasn't fun but I knew it was my fault. Now a days I have awesome times with 3-MeO-PCP! It's because I learned how to dose. You take a couple mgs maybe a tiny bit more every while. It makes it so much more enjoyable in general but also makes combining it with 3-MeO-PCP with other disso's and psychedelics. It's sweet that way. It just adds a little 3-MeO-PCP flavor and potentiates but dissociatives and psychedelics. It's still super strong but not as just insane feeling as dosing a larger dose of 3-MeO-PCP. 


I cannot wait to IM this one. I'm sure it will be really peaceful resolution of some of my problems and the things that happened to me in the last few months. It will be amazing to get into that true antidepressant effect and remind myself that nearly all problems have solutions and I was too worried about it for to long.

I agree...it was combining two full dosages of dissociatives that sent me adrift.  I had O-PCE two weeks earlier without incident.  Obviously I got hard headed but certainly learned a hearty lesson.  If I ever return....it will be at a very low level.

In regards to 3-MeO-PCP mixed, yes. 7mg 3-MeO and 20-30mg MXE had me fighting for my life on my bed against a demonic force. Real or not, doesn't matter, but it was one of if not the scariest experiences of my life. I don't mix 3-MeO unless I'm using tiny amounts of it, or tiny amounts of whatever else (if it's a psychedelic, if say MDMA then whatever).

It's a keeper for sure. In addendum to cr00k I would just emphasize again the strong psychedelic nature of this one compared to K. If you've done MXE, think the way that can be psychedelic. As soon as it hit I was absolutely elated to find the magic and as cr00k said, spiritually stimulating, side of it so strong.

I don't recall any fucking good day that a decent dose of 3-MeO-PCP went well with another disso, except with maybe 3-MeO-PCE. 


The times I added ket, 2-OxO-PCM, 2-OxO-PCE, MXE or a combination of them I never got any fun.


The only disso combos I consider nowadays are 2-OxO-PCM + ketamine, or 2-OxO-PCM+K as a preload for a dissohole with 2-OxO-PCE. Also any disso with any psychedelic, some beer, and some cannabis in moderation.

Yeah 3-MeO-PCP seems to cause a tremendous ramp-up in the effects of any other disso, for some reason.  Like overwhelmingly so.  When I did it I actually had a pretty good experience even though I barely remember it, I didn't freak out or anything and it felt pretty incredible, but the doses I used were really low for what I experienced.  Also I remember now doing a bump of 3-MeO-PCP (like 2-3mg), and then doing a maybe 5-6mg bump of 3-MeO-PCE, and I got really fucking dissociated too, way more than I expected and it made me nervous until it chilled out.

You prolly should listen to cr00k, as he is kind of a Vet in this, but if you got stomach problems I suggest insufflation. It may require a LITTLE bit more (5mg?) compared to all other ROAs but still you can easily hole with insufflated 2-Oxo-PCE in my experience. I personally found it awesome via insufflation.


In general I do not understand the fuzz about oral vs. insufflation when it comes to comparing the ROAs of psychedelics/dissos. With psychs you usually need a much lower dose (especially with phenethylamines) via insufflation. With dissos you need a slightly higher dose, but the experience is better controllable and you get to the same stage with the right dosage. Titration is one of the main keys to understand any psychoactive substance, so I prefer insufflation with most synthetic compounds, as I have full power over the strength of the effects, when applied via nasal ROA.

Alas, I've just taken the last of my O-PCE.  Order another 500mg last night though. Really starting to worry that the magic is gone.  I don't even really remember getting high from 30 mg last night. Don't remember anything, to tell you the truth.

What do you mean by saying "you don't remember getting high"? I've blacked out on dissos many times without checking the time and concluded I experienced no psychedelic effects, as absurd as that may sound. Sometimes less is more, especially when approaching that blackout threshold.

But then if I dose 30mg without tolerance in four 7-8mg doses spread out across a few hours I would experience next to no effects at all, even when injecting them intramuscularly.

I was already very experienced when I ran into similar issues with DCK. I eventually used 5x50mg IM because it just wasn't working lol. Should never have happened. Less is more my friend! It's not easy finding the sweet spot with 2-Oxo-PCE, but once I found it I could rely on the intensity of effects I'd experience on that same dose.

Well it's moving time again and I decided I needed a pick-me-up a little stronger than coffee today for the task of organizing and packing so I folded a cute little rectangle of aluminum foil up to lay some O-PCE on(weighed the foil on my scale then dumped the O-PCE on top and subtracted the foil weight from the weight of the drug). The total dose comes in around 13mg or so but i've been dipping my pinkie on the foil every couple of hours rather than taking it all at once. I noticed a nice initial pick-me-up around the hour mark with some slight euphoria and coordination issues but not much. As I pack my belongings some memories pass through my mind accompanied by some comedy. Thinking about the side-effects of sobriety gives way to some much needed laughter. If sobriety was a drug it would be a dangerous one due to the risk of suffering from any number of maladies ie. depression, anxiety, boredom, ignorance, death. That's where the train of thought headed, amusing abstract thinking. There was slight disassociation on the come-up of the first finger-lick than just a continuation of stimulation on subsequent administration, taste was not so finger-lickin' good. No tolerance was noted as i've abstained from dissociative's for 6+ months until today. Feels like the magic is there for me to discover again, I plan to keep it around now ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

Stilll never tried this by IM nor have I ever used a needle in my life. As far as harm reduction I find vaping the  freebase to be the safest. You can gage your doses more as the effects come on immediately and I find it does not mess with my stomach as much. 


In all honesty though I really do not need people to tell me not to try a  pure grade dissociative say like K from a vial or pure O-PCE through an IM route. With precautions and a good scale it could be an amazing experience that I do want to try some time in my lifetime. Is IM K safer  or less harmful then snorting large amounts of it. Can not be good on someones nose, stomach or urinary track to snort large amounts of dissociatives. Using less by IM could possibly be less harmful to the urinary track if less substance is entering the stomach and passing through your urine. 


As to the idea that if I IM'd O-PCE I would enter a state in which I could not control my intake is something that no one but myself would know. That is not my relationship with dissos. I use them sparingly. Like 2-3 times a month. I see people using these substances such as 3-meo-PCP daily as maintenance tools. I don't judge them. I also see people with insane tolerances to these substances. I don't judge them either. Thats there issue not mine.

Have to say that O-pce just may not work well for me.  Tried a small dose via IM injection...15mg.  Didnt seem much stronger than had I just eaten it.  Moreover, I find the substance way too stimulating and confusing...IMing it did not change those aspects. Guess this one is just not for me.

I have been going all over the web looking at the very few Tiletamine reports there were. Almost all of them, including many who said they had the real thing, were Telazol (Tell Us All) type mixtures of half Tel, half Zolazepam, intended to have a benzo blackout overshadow the dissociative experience to prevent animals freaking out. This obviously causes excess zombification, memory holes, enhanced addictiveness and compulsiveness, diminished entheogenic effects.


I got a big observation I saw mentioned nowhere online, here it is:


**Tiletamine is the thienyl version of O-PCE. It is O-TCE.

Likewise, O-PCE is the phenyl version of Tiletamine.

Tiletamine is to O-PCE what TCP is to PCP**


O-PCE is big, now that MXE is out of the picture.

Tiletamine is likely similar to O-PCE, a tad more potent and a bit shorter acting (thiophene metabolizes faster than benzene) that O-PCE and likely a tad more stimulant.


**Tiletamine = O-TCE**


Its probaly not nearly as fun as MXE and definitely "not for everyone" but I think that people appreciating O-PCE might appreciate O-TCE if it came without the ubiquitous benzodiazepine wallop.


I don't want to be in a benzo blackout, but if I have to be, then certainly not on a strong dissociative. This is why we keep benzo doses very low on dissociatives, to avoid going off the rails.


Interestingly O-PCE is rapidly soluble in water, so Tiletamine will likely be also.

You sure made tiletamine sound like it could be worth a try after all. It shouldn't be that hard to separate the time travel essence from the truth serum, right?

I appreciate Asante's posts greatly - in fact I think one of them originally inspired me to try MXE and so put me on this route ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png) but I don't understand... Tiletamine, is that even an ACH? Why would it have any affinity to O-PCE?

Tiletamine is indeed an arylcyclohexylamine; the only difference between tiletamine and 2'-Oxo-PCE is that the aryl is a thienyl instead of a phenyl.


Interestingly, there is also [this very recent scientific paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28577066) showing that tiletamine has anxiolytic properties that ketamine does not in rodents. I would certainly be very interested to hear what people think of it....

Fresh from the works:


I see it - namely, I see how it is possible that a molecule can flip around the page and reveal the cosmic machinery, which is sort of a parlour trick. But the very act of trying to enunciate it conceals it. And that is exactly the trick. 


In fact, the very act of trying to grasp it, conceals it. Paradoxically, the revelation of multitudiousness of life that emerges from static stillness is identical with the discovery of the stillness, the emptiness. 


It is inbuilt in this thing that we call existence. It has been there always, it will always be, there is no escape from it, neither is there any entry into it. It is static, self-sustaining, reposing on itself, never ending conundrum that is pure bliss and yet terror too.


Each and everything is just a variation of the other, and if you look closer, the variation is kind of optical illusion. I am a kaleidoscope that is somehow peeking inside itself. 


There is a tinge of fear when you open up to the possibility of total solipsism, that everything is a simulation brought forward by yourself starting from some immemorial epoch and which goes on forever with no possibility of ending - because by definition nothing can exist outside the simulation of itself. But you are always overwhelmed by the next successive realization that you are just a small atom in the immense game of self-concealment and self-revelation, and there is no other way how things could possibly be. It's like that. You are everything that is, and yet, you are a but a mote of dust eternally travelling down the corridors of eternal existence.


Indeed, the possibility of anything existing seems impossible. And the probability of that occurring is equal to the impossibility of making anything possible. Yet this thing goes on and on and on. Or so it seems..

Okay, so, warning/learning time about O-PCE. Although this story has much less to do with O-PCE than with sketchy-ass people.


So, I had one of my acquaintances over. Ten years ago I would have called him a friend. He's been sketched out on shooting up meth for a couple years now, and the social effects are insanely noticeable. He will try to come to your house or apartment, then plant himself until you offer him a bowl  or something. When this story takes place, I was not totally aware of this change.


We both did a shot of O-PCE. Different needles, different spoons, of course, etc. We both did about 35mg, which is common for me and extremely strong for him. When he was about to leave, I decided to shoot the moon with O-PCE. I weighed out 58mg on my scale and dumped it in my spoon. The next thing I know, I woke up with water spilled all over my table, my phone missing, my laptop charger missing, 1/4 of my monthly prescribed diazepam missing, the vial of my last 180mg of O-PCE missing, and a lack of memory after that second shot


Yes, he stole my phone. Yes, he stole my laptop charger. Yes, he stole my weekly Valium. He also spilled the water on the table in a grab for the vial of O-PCE. He also accidentally took a video on my phone, about four seconds long, of me sitting in my chair, BREATHING, with my dog in my lap. I just had my eyes closed. He came back later the next day with those items (except for the O-PCE and Valium) and claimed that I begged him to take them. This is after he claimed that I lost consciousness, stopped responding, and stopped breathing. He didn't call emergency services, he just robbed me.


Friends of his say this is a pattern, and they can't tell if he's lost his mind or just wants attention. Whatever it may be, he is completely gone from my life.


I guess the moral of the story is: if you're going to do a heroic dose of O-PCE, do it around someone whom you can trust. And only increase your doses by 5-7mg at a time... ![:|](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eyesclosed.gif)

I've heard stories of people getting into K-holes in raves, then waking up find that everything is gone..


So sad.


And one more thing -  concerning "heroic dose", that has no place when it comes to dissociatives.


Terence McKenna coined that term long time ago to distinguish those who were serious about psychedelics and those 

who were looking for distraction.. But I think the term has fallen into misuse. 


With ACHs, less is more, sparser is longer...

Fuck what kind of raves do you attend? I always end holing on the floor 99% of the times when I go to a rave, but the people that also attend it care about me even without knowing me. Peace, love, unity and respect are still valid values in the raves I attend. I supose it's a totally different thing in mainstream ones.

Snorting 10 mg of this substance resulted in annoying mania bordering on mild psychotic symptoms. The following day there was still a lot of energy left, but not the good kind. 


Could this be the roa? Should I give this another try orally or stay away from O-PCE altogether? 


For reference; I also experience some mania on MXE, but in a way more limited and positive form. 3-MeO-PCE has some similar properties like O-PCE, but is a bit more mellow.

I feel that 2-oxo-pce is very lackluster snorted. I only would snort 3-meo's and 2-oxo-pcm, but also those ones are more potent orally.


Try 20-25mg orally and you'll reack the rabbit hole for sure ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Here's my approach, I'm not sure if I can recommend it to anyone, but it is what I do these days.


Decide a smallish dosage, according to tolerance. Aim just for feeling something. Then repeat the dose, say after hour, and continue like this...

Eventually you'll start to experience non-ordinary dimensions, while still capable of functioning in "real" world. At this threshold, I stop and perhaps 

smoke a joint, which changes it to a kind of trip which goes very deep, while not being overwhelming. I usually receive "revelations" of a sort, which 

are like variations on the theme of non-duality.


Then next day, I take my small dosage again, but I increase the dosing intervals, and decrease a little the dose. I muse on my most recent revelations,

digest them, try to integrate them. When that is done, I revert back to step A, as described above, and get new "revelations". 


And so on until I run out of O-PCE (my consumption is about 300mg per week now). Then I spend some time without, just to acclimatize myself to the 

"ordinary consensus reality" and do some self-criticism also.. Then, I put an order for more....

It really does not eat away that much from my other time. Doing household chores is really neat on ACHs ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) I have tried to calibrate it so I can function normally at any time. 

Once . so far only once - I miscalculated. I had to locate a bed and near-holed for some time. The lady of the house wondered a bit about such sudden nap (Oh well, maybe she guessed) On weekend nights I also took some extra doses with MJ and meditated.

I had a very negative experience on this a few days ago at a festival. 


Throughout the day I was already ingesting a variety of substances - about 5 hits of LSD, a little bit of coke, ketamine, DCK, weed of course, and a few hits of opium. 

I went off by myself to the second to last show of the night. At this point I came down a lot from the acid and was mostly feeling the DCK. I thought this would be a good time to take the 2-oxo-pce capsule I had been holding on to. This would be my second time taking it - the first time was at home a few months ago. At that time I first tried an oral dose of around 10-12mg, and when I didn't feel much I snorted a bit more (can't remember exactly how much). The effects were not overwhelming at all and were reminiscent of MXE (one of my all time fav substances). 

So I took the capsule, which I think had around 15mg in it, and started feeling it about 2/3 of the way through the show. It felt good at first. I was already really vibing to the set, and feeling a little bit heavier and looser only made dancing more fun. When the set ended I felt a bit disoriented, but mostly sad that it ended. I then walked back to my friends who were at the main stage, not at all a far walk. However the walk felt very long and I felt increasingly more heavy. I focused on getting to my friends and to a place to sit. 

Once I sat down it felt like I would not be able to get up. I wanted to talk to my friends and tried to participate in conversation, but it seemed that my body wanted me to close my eyes and drift away. I was worried that I was worrying my friends by not acting like my usual self. My vision became blurry and at some point while sitting there I thought to myself, "this is what dying must feel like". I think my vision being affected is what worried me the most. All I could think about was getting back to the campsite and laying down, although the prospect of walking all the way back was daunting.  

When I did close my eyes it was basically just blackness, so if this was a hole, it was not a very interesting one. At some point during this last set I felt very nauseous. I managed to get up, walk a distance from my friends and dry heave. I guess I had not been drinking or eating enough all day to actually throw up. This did make me feel a bit better though, and I was able to talk to my friends more easily. However a couple of times I thought I was coming down, just to fall back into the overwhelming effects. It didn't even feel much like dissociation and it did not feel MXE-like at all. 

My friend helped me walk back to our campsite and I almost immediately excused myself to my tent. Even though I was finally comfortable, alone, and lying down, the effects were still not particularly fun (as a hole on another dissociative would be). Mercifully I was able to drift off to sleep, which was nice because usually I cannot sleep without benzos if I've taken LSD that day. 

The next day I felt fine, although when I smoked later on I felt a hint of the heaviness return. Although maybe that was from getting minimal sleep throughout the course of the weekend ![:p](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png) 


Maybe it interacted negatively with one or more of the other drugs I put in my body that day? I'm normally very good at handling high doses of substances, so the effects really alarmed me at the time. However I do plan on continuing to experiment with this. But maybe I'll save it for fun times at home.

Perfect festival drug lol - especially in combination with acid. You wouldn't be the first time to ingest such a combo at a festival just to find himself strapped to a bed in the local hospital. You were lucky.


And that was not a hole as far as I can tell. 2-Oxo-PCE holes are very 'colorful' and exciting.

It's always a gamble to experiment with new substances at festivals. I kind of can't bother anymore, and just stick to the few classics I know really well. That's at festivals only, off cause. Great that you managed to get back to the tent at least, and that you didn't embaressed yourself or made you freinds worry to much.

Three buddies of mine recently went to a festival (Syndikate) and dropped 8mg DOC each on top of whatever ketamine/MDMA/cocaine cocktail they were already on. The story starts off with "A doctor, a lawyer and a chef..." and does not end well at all. They're all very experienced with psychedelics, especially DOC. Festivals are the worst place to push the boundaries, especially when it comes to dissociatives. Even if you are in fact able to handle your shit, paramedics and police may disagree. Convincing them that you're fine can be tough once you've lost your ability to form words. :D

O-PCE holes are somewhat similar to MXE holes with an even more dangerous potential for overdoses and blackouts due to a higher potency than mxe, I haven't found a sweet spot dosage with o-pce, 130mg mxe sublingualed used to get me where I wanted to be, however that's a dosage adapted to my tolerance to NMDA antagonists at the time. 


Whereas I found deschloroketamine closer to ketamine o-pce has that stimulating effect that brings me to find it's effect closer to say 3-meo-pcp.


That said, if you plan on messing around with this cyclohexane, do it with a trip sitter, in a safe set and setting, and don't combine with anything else. Oh and have an accurate scale, as well as knowing the purity of your product (the 94% is strong ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

Lol, nice short anecdote. If you are used to be on the higher tiers of the social pyramid I can imagine you can get carried away with your own attitude towards what you can handle and your own judgment vs. that of professionals. I personally would try to not get involved in any type of potentially uneasy combo (other than maybe one of the above mentioned together with moderate booze/weed abuse) in a festival setting.

So my wife is gone for 4 days and surprisingly it was her who suggested for me to use this opportunity and dive into the great beyond.


Has anybody combined this with 2C-B? I've mixed 2.2mg 2C-E into a 15mg IV dose twice (topped up with 2-3 5mg IM doses) and it was hands down the best drug combo I have ever had. Now since my buddy has a gram of 2C-B I am wondering if I could further improve on it.


Maybe somebody has mainlined 2C-B on it's own and has dosage suggestions? I'd play it safe with 3mg.

I've combined it with 2C-B, 2C-I and 2C-D with amazing results. As those 2C's are toy psychedelics and very lackluster IMHO by themselves I just took my usual dose of disso with my usual dose of 2C at the same time orally.


20-25mg of 2C-B/I or 30-35mg of 2C-D + 25mg of 2-OxO-PCE = awesome time.

Aaah thanks for the info, too bad you haven't combined it with 2C-E, despite being probably being the only bluelighter who's tried it with 2C-B.


I've personally injected it along with 2C-E twice and was absolutely amazed. Gonna have to repeat that instead of taking risks since I rarely get to do this these days. Considering throwing some MDMA in the mix, but that's probably a bad idea. Last time I woke up 6 hours later with 50mg 2-Oxo-PCE and 200mg gone with no recollection.


EDIT: Drew up 1 syringe with 2.2mg 2C-E and 22mg 2-Oxo-PCE for IV use and two 5mg doses for IM injections just in case. Left the rest kilometers away from home, so I'm more or less safe. I really hope I'm not gonna redose before I hit the bed and end up with amnesia...

I've f*cked around with ACHs. 3-MeO-PCP was one of them.

2-Oxo-PCE is something different. 2-Oxo-PCE scares me.


At least I should say I've got some serious respect for it.

Yes it went well and I remember most of it, but alas it was pretty lackluster. Can't expect a religious experience every time, no matter how rarely I use it. I should have probably used a higher amount of 2C-E in that first shot, going to aim for 2.7mg next time. I'm wondering if I messed up the last time 'it worked' and actually used 4.4mg instead of 2.2mg, but nay, 2C-E is very potent when used intravenously. It didn't quite come through yesterday. I remember the rush earlier this year and the 2C-E clearly dominated then. Hmmmmm, 

during 

I could give it another try since I have time until Sunday... Maybe more 2C-E, less dissociative, wee biit of MDMA... Tempting...


EDIT: Oh btw I ended up using 22mg 2-Oxo-PCE with 2mg 2C-E in the first injection that was I had planned to be 15+2.2 because I slightly messed up during preparation, but that should not have been an issue. Or was it? Maybe I did actually dose too high and can't remember the first two hours, there's just no telling. I think that is unlikely though.


The only major downside to 2-Oxo-PCE is that it's really difficult to get the dosage just right. I can't trust myself having it around after the first dose and 25-30mg are where I have found my sweet spot, but sometimes it just doesn't do the trick the way it should. Oh well, I had a good time anyway. ![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif)

Yeah having a spiritual experience mixing dissos and psychedelics is really tricky, you need to have some luck. Also blacking out with 2-oxo-pce is an easy thing, one day 25mg will give me an amazing hole and next time with same dose I won't remember anything ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)

On the theme of trying to get a religious or spiritual experience with psychedelics and in 

particular, with O-PCE, I've found that trying to trying to "force" a specific type of journey is 

not possible. Of course one would like to duplicate some nice thing one has had in the past, 

but it ain't going to happen. There is a paradox here though. In a way the experience is always 

the same, yet the associations and intepretations that you come up with tend to vary. Then there 

is this weird synchronistic magic that is the hallmark of ACHs in general, and when things go 

happen like that you can't help but being caught up with what could be called awe.


The bottomline is, don't expect your trip to conform into a pattern and miraculously you will 

in the end get what you wished for.

Anyone realized a pretty significant impairment of their hearing abilities as the sole obvious effect of a low dose combo of this and/or a 3-meo-PCE ? Don't get me wrong, I really like both substances, but in my last trial I had the loss of hearing as the most prominent predicate to note. I had to push the volume very high in order to listen to acoustic messages. Impairment of movement was insignificant.

I dare say I enjoy rectal administration as much as IM injections. I also don't get amnesia with those roa's as easily as i do when I mainline it.

I've been theoretizing this! I've given up on each of them individually really, because one's too "cold" and the other too "warm" for my liking. Though that indeed begs the question of combining.


Anyone else anything to say about this particular cocktail?


(edit) So to corroborate my hunch with cringy amateur psychopharmacology: take MXE's chemical skeleton. Remove the methoxy group, it gets too cold. Remove MXE's oxo group and it get too warm. Therefore with the forces of both these fallen angels combined, surely they can't but somewhat compensate for each other's shortcomings?

I've done maybe 1.5g's of o pce, and have never holed. Also, never plugged it, which is crazy for me. Dunno why. I just kept taking smaller doses orally/nasally. I think I will give it a go soon with hopefully some 4 aco dpt. I have been wanting to try that for a while.

It's drug better than DXE? More like MXE?

I tried DXE and I did not like it. No euphoria, but great mental embarrassment...![:|](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eyesclosed.gif)

uff....this statement is now over a year old. I posted something about needing this stuff on 23/06/2016. I used a lot of dissociatives in the meantime, about 1,5 g oxo-pce, 1 g oxo-pcm and surely about 2 g of 3-meo-pce, even though i went through a medical anti-depressant therapy. But now it is a month since i used the most recent disso, i am not taking ADs anymore and atm i'm not looking forward to use some again...i just wanted to tell you guys there was a way out for me...  And i am doing fine so far. Greetings!

I did 2 grams of 2f-ket, so far, so good so far from what i remember, then that genius voice, yours truly, though it would be a good idea to rack up 3 lines (each 20-30mg) so a total of nearly 100mg o-pce....

This doesn't end well all though it could have been worse.

I remember finishing the 2t-ketamine 2,g, sniffing the o-pce 100mg.

Then i wake up

Tied down to a hospital"bed" 

Apparently I was trying to get a job..... AT THE MORGUE!!!!

In my dissociative state i wanted to work at the MORGUE lol.

The hospital is just by mine btw

My amazing girlfriend managed to get the five oh to chill out and talked to various doctors so this time they didn't drive me back to Paris by ambulance, tied down.


Props to my girl, my old man and all yall that show love

I had a couple days of trials with 2f-dck, o-pce and a touch of 4-aco-dmt this weekend. Great fun and didnt end up at the morgue or even black out at all. Although with the current availability of O-PCE, I dont feel the value equaled the price. Also I have noticed this time and in past trials that O-PCE has a weird after-effect for me that aggravates nerve pain for a day or two afterwards. The 2f felt more kind in that regard.

Much, much deeper. I've done a lot of dissociatives in excess and the only ones that get me deeper are the phenidines. It's not as easy to get it right wtih this one though though, not as easy as it is with ketamine. I'm entirely satisfied with one successful experience every now and then, easily makes up for all the lackluster ones.

I messed with some of this shit last week and had an extremely morbid couple days thinking about death, murder dismemberment etc. I think it started because I read a nasty news story shortly after the first dose. But I don't blame the o-pce I've gotten sick thoughts from time to time on pretty much every dissociative I've tried.


I also did 500mg in 2 days, after not doing any dissociatives for a couple months I think my permatolerance is starting to make these drugs not worthwhile.

you have a history of getting violent on dissociatives and now you go one a binge obsessing about murder. do you really think you can handle it? what if one day after a dose you kill someone for real?

Treezy, yes please take heed, these drugs are about set and setting, and it sounds like you need to hash out a lot of things on that end before getting back into that land. And that dosing is equally reckless. I have a bit of a base tolerance and still get where I want on a quarter of that amount in 2 days.

That's a hard one UserNAN. If you have intestinal inflammation maybe better to take it intranasally. As for antibiotics...I don't see how it could adversely interact with antibiotics, but I'm definitely not a professional. Would be good to know though!

I plan this to be the next dissociativum in the next few months. Which dosage do you recommend for an MXE hardhead? And do you recommend nasal or rectal administration? Intramuscular is a no way to go for me for a research drug. Or is it smokeable? Although this actually should be a no-go, as smoking tends to increase the stimulant effects of dissociatives.

Rectal. No idea on dosage when it comes to being a hardhead. I'd start at maybe 17mg plugged if you're a hardhead.

I've had some of this chemical for a while, tried it once by itself and once in combination with Deschloroketamine and enjoyed it both times. Unfortunately my Eticyclidone is very clumpy and moist textured and tends to stick together, which makes it a lot more difficult to handle and to weigh confidently. Is there a way to dry it out or to make it more powdery/crystally for ease of use without negatively affecting the chemical? Could cooking it in a similar way to ketamine work or would this be likely to destroy the chemical? Apologies if this is am ignorant question, but with such a potent chemical anything that could make it easier to use safely would be helpful!

Yo street halo, yeah the last batch I got was a sticky sludge. Apparently though it was powder when shipped. Because it is very hydroscopic it will accumulate ambient moisture. Packing with silica gel should help. Anyway, if you want to make it easier to use, we put the sludge on a plate on top of a pot of boiling water and it crisped into a nice powder easily. I don't think it reduces potency/ integrity of the chemical

Following the tail end of a hexen binge, with some ethanol (vodka) ingested throughout, all totaling no more than maybe 3 shots, unmeasured doses of O-PCE caused a series of full body seizures. Will link to more detailed post shortly. Careful!


I have NO history of seizures except on high doses of dissocs

Someone mentioned noise dampening or "hearing loss" as a side effect of dissociatives. I view this as a positive effect and one I prefer due to living in a noisy home in a noisy city. Psychedelics feel like they heighten perception, esp sound, while dissociatives seem to make the pauses or silence between sounds more noticeable. I noticed 2F-Ketamine does a good job of reducing the over stimulation from noise one gets after a stimulant binge. I can't recommend taking dissociatives when in that state due to my previous post (I had a series of seizures sleep deprived mixing hexen and o-pce)

I was thinking about getting this but then I remembered last time I did it I got so paranoid I thought about shooting a mouse because I thought it was a demon, caught myself and paced back and forth ranting for hours.


At this point I've hung up the boots on dissociatives other than DXM because it's mild and ketamine because it's relaxing.

Treezy Z is a BL-hero. Not to say, that you shouldn't change your attitude towards the semi-conscious intake of mind poisons (that we all crave).


Out of all of the hyped dissos 2-Oxo-PCE is my least favourite because it causes - sorry for the least scientific approach - fainting for me as an after effect. Even 24h after low doses occasional fainting guaranteed for me (until about T+48h). Weird shit.

Very interesting, I didn't even know dissociative induced seizures are a thing.


It's even more surprising that it would happen while you are on a GABAergic drug like ethanol. Then again... Ethanol, too, is an NMDA antagonist.


If I was you and if this had been my first seizure I would clearly blame Hexen for the event. It's what stimulants do. Few cocaine or meth users whoo IV or inhale their drug of choice have never had or at least witnessed a full-blown tonic clonic seizure.

I agree. It was most likely the sleep deprived state with the ingestion of seizure reducer that caused the seizure. Ethanol isn't like benzos because of its dirty pharmacology plus I don't believe it activates gaba receptors like bzds do. Not to mention its quick elimination from the body...

Not like benzodiazepines, but it has been shown to increase seizure threshold in mice, especially when combined with seizure inducing drugs, relative to their administration without ethanol.

I fucked up. 


This last week, I binged on O pce and 3hoPCP, no more than 30mg Opce in one intake and 10mg of 3hoPCP. It was a very long time I didn't took a disso before that. I experienced some sort of bad trip (no dissociation but feeling very bad physically) at the end with tolerance. 


Since sunday, I'm all fucked up, with increased tinnitus, feeling slowed down, some sort of depersonalization, headache, on/off strange sensation over the mouth, and more alarmingly sort of tingly feeling in low side of my body. Aside this kind of dp/dr, Ive nothing if I take diazepam. Since it's the first time Ive these symptom, I'm scared that they will not go away and that's my new state of being. 


Am I fucked forever ? 


Ill not take disso anymore, too dangerous, Ill stick to 5ht2a psyche.


note : 3hoPCP is a fucking good drug, even better than 0pce imo. This have been confirmed by a friend who tested these stuff with myself and is absolutely not versed into RC.

No you're not fucked up forever, you just overdid it.  Dissociatives are known for causing tinnitus.  It's only been a few days it sounds like, just give yourself time to recover.  No drugs, etc.  Including no weed.

strange sensation over the mouth and tingling scare the shit out of myself, I'm fearing excitotoxic damage. Tingling stay in my comprehension a proof of neurological insult.


The trip was really bad, I was feeling like there was a periodic wowowowowowo inside my body. Seriously I feel fucked. Ive no emotion anymore. Currently fearing for the rest of my life. 


This never hapenned previously with disso, I was thinking in fact it was a quite benign substance while you don't overdo it (I don't think Ive that overdone it, I took it 4 day on 1 week, never exceding 20 or 30 mg a day)


omg


Obviously Ill no take any drugs aside my treatment wich is subutex.


What make me a bit bad is that dissociative hangover never took more than 1 day to clear for myself...

Obsessive fear can cause all sorts of issues... when you believe you're permanently damaged, you can end up feeling permanently damaged.  The mind is a powerful thing.  Please do your best to try to chill out and let things come as they will.  Chronic anxiety actually causes health problems but it's a state of mind that you can decide to not participate in.

got some dck from a (fairly) reputable and well known source, and this stuff was not dck (at least not alone)


the effects are very close, aside from dck having a deeper couch lock, and this batch being active at 5mg. 20mg is a complete hole dose, and i would not be able to tell the difference between the hole states of each. 25mg prolongs the hole, but REALLY prolongs the comedown (to the point of drawn out discomfort and a lack of satisfactory cognitive ability)


i perfer deschloroketamine, while my partner prefers this batch (doesnt make her throw up from dizziness like dck does... i like the dizzies i get from it)


im wondering if there is anything this could be besides o-pce... my first guess was that it is a mix of opce and opcm, but theres a lot of online chatter about what presumably is this same batch of ultra-potency dck, and the general consensus seems to be mislabeled opce. 


any input? i am willing to move on from dck (cause this stuff stacks so well with other dissos anyway, i dont think id miss it) for my partner's health, but i want to be sure i can get this stuff again.


thanks for any help

A lot of the DCK going around right now is o-pce. There was a batch tested by Hamilton recently which proved this. It?s talked about a lot on reddit, I?ll see if I can find relevant links when I?m on my computer. 

The o-pce batch looks different then DCK I?ve had. The o-pce is is smaller clear white crystals while DCK seems to be large chunks of tan crystal, similar to ?moonrock? MDMA.

ive had the big chunky rocky tan dck, and ive had plain white powder dck,


reading through this, everyone was talking about snorting o-pce, and i realized that ive never tried snorting this mystery batch (i rarely, if ever, snort my dissociatives). 


came up in half the time, and although it was nothing like 'psychedelic cocaine', i will say that there was some (possibly psychosomatic) numbing of the gumming, and i was quite talkative. 


insufflation lasts just as long (overall, including the dumbed down taildrag of a comedown, which i hate), except the peak was over in barely any time, solidifying my impression of snorting ACHs as being pointless ('cept good ol' k, of course)

Hey, quick question. I've tried searching the web, but was unable to get any info.

I searched through BL threads as well.


Can anyone tell me the boiling point of O-PCE Hcl? 

Is O-PCE soluble in Propylene Glycol? 


Please excuse my brevity, and any crappy formatting, I'm using my phone at the moment. 


Kind regards, 

Mude

End of this story & more detail about it : 


"End of the story : I stopped using drugs aside subutex (4mg a day) after 2 week after this post (I binged a stim on these 2 week). I'm back to normal, aside the lack of emotion due to subutex (wich fade when I reduce my dose or when I'm not high anymore hours after the intake).

I think the lack of emotion was due to too much subutex, I was taking 8->16mg at these time. Since I reduced things got way better. I don't know what is attributable to Subutex (as I know it do bad things for me, Ive even needed to stop working for tapering) and to O-pce. I know that when I was firstly at 4mg months ago, if I tested 8mg at these time, I felt like junk, detached, strange. But tingling was due to O-pce, I'm 100% sure. It got better then finally stopped."

Honestly Ive even forgotten completely about that last month, even thinking that it would be cool idea to order a dissociative (my mind don't registrate negative experience in a normal way as I'm bipolar III). I'm fully back to my previous self. Finding back these post made me hesitate.

I think remembering only the good parts of past drug use is a normal sign of addictive tendencies/addiction, it's why people relapse after they quit things.

Why do you want to know this? There may be better ways to approach whatever you're doing, if you care to elaborate.


O-PCE HCl is a solid at room temperature and will first have a melting point, which is already quite high. Like with ketamine and MXE it should be expected that thermal decomposition already occurs at that point, and toxic fumes are produced by this.


I assume you want to vape it... it should work just like it apparently does with K and DCK and use of PG appears to be a bit better, but you should expect some buildup of residu on your coil / wick considering decomposition and of course the toxic fumes are a problem. Neither of these things are likely to be immediately apparent if you were to try but you should definitely expect them.

The way I think about it, is that I've always had tinnitus but never really noticed before intense dissociation. Brings you right back to the mother note - a single pitch. The highest and lowest pitch at once. I associate the sound with serenity and have learned to love it.

Dissos give me tinnitus too.  3-HO-PCP does it the most of any I've tried.  But yeah, any time it's quiet I notice it, always have.  If I concentrate I can even hear it faintly right now through the keyboard noises as I type.

I'm not a believer in clinical ADHD, but even low doses of this one morph myself into the most unfocused bundle of energy for at least 24h after intake. Hate that. May be coincidence, though.

Tried this substance for the first time. Did 20mg, followed by 10mg, followed by 20mg over 5 hours and went straight through a hole. To the people who say they don't hole on this, I can't imagine it because this is a hole drug. Maybe our definition of hole isn't solid, but my entire universe sort of flipped inside out as i titrated up to 50mg. I assume 30mg oral would be my hole dose with this. It's a short hole, and the after effects are long (12-24 hours). Probably not the best before bedtime. I will experiment with it more in terms of low dose stacking/A-D quality and see what happens after a few days. Definitely not going to stack this one through the vast expanses of spacetime to the origin of existence like i did with 3-meo-pcp, I think o-pce will sit one on his ass a lot faster than 3-meo-pcp will. This stuff is more like, strap in and hang on and don't forget me anytime soon! 


It is refreshing to have more of a 'normal' dissociative around. 3-meo-pcp is in a league of its own and I probably got everything and more out of it than a person ever could. This o-pce is just what I needed for now, but it's warm disso rush has me dreaming of a good batch of DCK. 


O-PCE me of a drug that lies between the heavy stoning of K and the white-washing of MXE, with none of the visceral face-melting wrath of 3-meo-pcp. Fun, intense stuff.


Side note: 10mg of this stuff politely escorts the entire contents of my bowels to the door. Not typical of dissociatives for me, but surely adds a welcomed bonus.

I have a batch of what *might* be this or *might* be O-PCM or *might* be a bit of both (probably the same batch as mentioned upthread). I haven't sampled it, and don't have any batches of known O-PCE or O-PCM to compare it to (nor am I going to go out and acquire any without knowing what I already have). Is there a reagent test that will neatly tell the difference between the two?

Not sure, but I guess theres no reagent to diferentiate between the two, but looking at the dose/effects tables you could discern more or less what?s there

DCK is MUCH less potent insufflated.


Also DCK kind of feels like a low dose of 2c-c (additional to the dissociative effects), if that helps. 2-oxo-PCE not at all.

If anyone's interested: Marquis and Mandelin tests will tell the difference between O-PCE and O-PCM. O-PCM turns red, and later orange, on Mandelin, and doesn't do anything on Marquis. O-PCE does nothing on Mandelin, and turns light yellow on Marquis. The sample I was confused about was all O-PCM, no O-PCE.

I forgot I even had a big ol bag of this garbage. I tried it a handful times but then went back to ignoring it. How are people so obsessed with all these various bootleg MXE chems? Honest question. This stuff offers nothing deep or insightful. It's just a fruitless avenue to mania.

I like the effects of this substance. It is not exactly like MXE, but very smilar in some aspects, and much more potent by mg.

But I have stopped using it because of the hangovers. I feel a severe energy and emotional draining for two days after. That is very similar to a serotonin-releaser hangover, really nasty feelings.

Nobody here has got these hangovers with this substance? Maybe it is a problem of sub-quality batches?

I have only tried one batch (I don't want to risk trying others without guarantee) and I even did an acetone wash on it, but that only improved the experience slightly.

I have only tried o-pce twice or trice. The first one was incredible similar to MXE, same euphoria but way more physically holly, you know some difficulty to walk, etc. Wonderful material. Potent as hell. But the comedown is loooong. Too long. You could find yourself lingering the effects the next day in a non pleasurable way.


The second time I tried id didn?t got me to any interesting place and honestly I don?t remember the third time if there even I tried.


It?s a wonderfull molecule but with some long and boring/nasty afterfxs. Im guessing you could bypass the afterFXs just taking piracetam. Any people trying this to report would be most welcome.


You defenitively want to test waters if you like MXE.

It's definitely the most similar compound to MXE I've found. And, it doesn't hit the sweet spot in so many ways. It's sterile, clean, a bit harsh and metallic, and generally just doesn't have the magic that MXE has - the psychedelia where everything is full of magic and wonder. After effects were a bitch too. Oh, and it's super stimulating and the hole seemed to not last long at all. I plugged a decent amount, holed relatively hard, and then as soon as I was really into it, it started letting up and in my mind, seemingly demanding more to get back there, because I wasn't done yet.


Definitely don't combine it with LSD either, the stimulation is over the fucking top, and clarity of mind goes out the window.


It's ok but not great.

So it is pretty certain, that the magic of MXE comes from the 3-MeO chain. 3-MeO-PCE for me is "magic" pure, but it gets overstimulating and a little bit psychotic if you take too much. 2-oxo-PCE is clinical and causes an overwhelming amount of physical restlessness and mania the next day.


2-Oxo is great in combo with low-dosed psychedelics, though. Taken solo it causes long-lasting holes for me though (2h as far as I remember).

It's really interesting to me that the most widely liked and "magical" arylcyclohexylamine RCs all have a 3-MeO sub. Fascinating. Makes me wonder about 3-MeO-PCM?

Does IM injection of O-PCE reduce the unpleasant after effects the next day that seem to inevitably come with this substance? I noticed that MXE hit much faster and left much sooner when IM administered, and left even less of an afterglow the following day. In fact IM MXE felt closer to K this route of admin than I was able to ever get any other way, but that's off topic. DCK still lingers rather badly the next day after IM so I don't assume it's magic bullet ROA but if anyone out there has noticed a difference with O-PCE please share. Thank you.

One persons "overstimulation and mania" is my "get out of bed and do shit". haha.


got a g of this. I have been on/off dissos for 6-7 years on a pretty daily (when possible) basis. I flushed my entire stash (what a dumbass mistake since I haven't even tripped in like a year) . Took me about a month to say fuck it and get some more.  I dunno. dissociatives make me just not want to kill myself so much and give me the mindframe to get things done. 


That being said Immediatly noticed the bladder feeling come back and my memory slipping. Like within a few hours my short term memory was fucking up.


I don't have any desire to hole or anything at this point. I just want like 5mg in the morning to get up and not lay in bed until working wishing I was dead. I need to get up, get a car, make a lot of money, go skydiving and base jumping until i die ;-)

I’ve tried numerous times to find a use for this. 


Its tricked me twice with redosing, which didn’t result in anything bad.  Just amnesia. 


I love K, loved MXE and used quite a bit of DXM in my opiate days. 

i like 2-fdck, but find it a tad mild (only insufflated). 


I’m pretty close to putting o-pce in the museum due to not getting what I want from a disso. 


So my last try with these pce/pcp analogs is going to be 3meo-pce. 


Anyone out there who found no worth for themselves with o-pce but then succeeded with 3meo?

3 meo pce to me felt real speedy and I didn't really like it. Even harder to hole than o pce . I went through a gram of 3 meo pce and never felt like getting more. DCK and o pce were my next gen dissos. 


What is it you want from dissos. If it's the floaty nice k/mxe type hole then yeah I never really got it on o pce. I could holeish, but it was so short and then followed by sooooo much stimulation.


I've still been through grams of it, just mostly daily smaller dosing. Also comboing with psychs when I had no K

The 3-MeO-PCXs are no good for holing.  I personally really like 3-MeO-PCE, probably more than 3-MeO-PCP because I find the latter to be kind of cold and edgy whereas the former is warm and even empathogenic.  I've still only tried 5mg of O-PCE once even though I have like a half gram.  For some reason.

I didn't really like O-PCE.  I tried it at 10, 20, and 25 mg.  The stimulation during the comeup felt uncomfortable to me, in contrast to 3-MeO-PCP.  I holed at the highest dose, but I didn't want to repeat the hole like I did with MXE or ketamine.  It wasn't particularly euphoric for me.  I remember walking straight into my wide-open door when I was trying to walk through the doorway once.  I threw the rest I had away because I thought I might have a bad synergistic reaction to it (I've had problems controlling my usage of dissociatives moreso than any other class of drugs, especially while already high on other drugs).

Thanks for the input folk. 


Glad im not the only one that finds it, well, uncomfortable. 


.25g that I’ve just been researching on occasions nearly been thrown out twice. 


I seem to only indulge in it when there’s nothing else around, or waiting for something... yes. You all know what I mean.


i like holing. But I also like to have some memory of it, and feel comfortable. 


Low dose one of o-pce was good for some depression one day. But being the idiot that I am I ended up redosing and getting to a point of severe amnesia. The day went ok. But when I begun to gather my thoughts I felt ripped off in some way. 


Pushing it a little to far on 2fdck seemed great if it counts..?

I've been microdosing this after having it again and at 1-3mg the stimulation is very noticeable. I'm surprised how much I was able to take this daily for a period of 2-3 weeks last summer. I don't even have a desire to dose a full dose without some downer in addition.


EDIT: And not just stimulation, but what feels like mental almost confusion or overloading. It's like it's mentally so fast things begin to get scrambled a bit.

20-25 mg OPCE rectal daily is just a perfect "heroine-like" feeling to relax and numbing feeling at home.

Almost functional and creative if you don't go outside, it's a gem.

MXE was fun with some "cardboard head" feeling and sparkles.

OPCE with tolerance is just cool tender fluffy someway dumb but OK day.

So much potential for end of life once you have passed the psychedelic/mania period that form your mind to acceptance of yourself, after that its all bless and calm.

One year and nothing bad to say, body and mind are better than ever, a premise of paradise serenity for the elders.

I love o-pce, possibly even more than the famed mxe (although I guess I need to have both on hand and try each on it's own day to be sure.... but that's not happening with the current rip off mxe prices.


Usual doses are 30-60mg snorted or plugged sometmes on it's own other time with other dissos, psys (or both) or a-pvp (if I can get it... vaped o-pce + a-pvp = mania that makes cocaine cry) depending how far I want to take it. 


I wonder how o-pcpr would be like (Chinese chemists please listen ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) )


@psy997 surprised you can microdose this. I either feel nothing from a few mg or get too high from higher doses.

Dekey - I wanted to ask a couple of questions about your experience seeing those Entities if You have the time and don't mind. What made You feel like they were a Visual/Literal/Physical part of your Universe...What did they look like out of Curiosity (If Anything....)...Did You have or notice any form of Physical Contact with the Entities...Could You hear them through your Auditory Senses, or when They would Communicate - Was it more similar to just hearing People Conversing, except it was internal, strictly inside your Head, not originating in your Ears??       


I've had a few very very unique experiences with O-PCE - (or O-X-O) as I prefer to call it. I saw a form, that most wold refer to as an Alien/Entity/Form from another Dimension. I told a friend exactly what happened and He said it very well could of been just that...Or it also could have been My Brains Personal Visual Interpretation of an Experience going on Internally within myself - but being displayed to Me, not only Visually, but thru other important Belief Building less common Physical Sensations that I never could have guessed would be possible. Like Your personal brain is building a little "Show" so to speak to communicate with You at different points on this Compound. I personally had experiences like this, while all entirely unique, but still ongoing in a way of the previous Intense Visions/Delusions/Alternative Realities that these "Entities" come from or reside in. I had MULTIPLE more intense FULL BLOWN OEV'S like nothing I'd ever seen on some Travels. The entire side of some Bills of Money - having the words twist, bend, distort, melt, change colors as they swirled and then REFORM back to something comprehensible. 


Another time I felt like I was being given an Interview by a Court/Classroom/Professors room full of "Fellow Forms" who could only communicate when My Eyes were kept Closed and I focused my attention on My Mind. It was like seeing a small Visual Crowd behind Your Eyelids when You closed them. They gave Me some form of 20 Questions Description Requests about bizarre and out there concepts as well as some more Classic Forms of Christianity - It was just weird if nothing else. The Strangest Part...I felt like I had taken and studied for this test that I never previously knew about existing until the Moment it was sprung on Me, and that it was VERY Important and something that I had been waiting for a long time to give these "Answers" of all types. I was instructed to keep my Legs Crossed (Indian Style) and sit on the floor while I addressed the mental room and shared my "Earth Experience".


Dekey---Was what You experience in any way similar to this?


Also, I legit feel bad for people that are not getting to Enjoy the full experience of O-X-O, it sounds like there are some VERY mediocre batches going around. That's a super bummer! Both Batches that I got a hold of appeared to be of Incredible Purity just off appearance, it was almost as clear as Glass, and in Very Well Formed and similar crystalline Shapes. It was straight up amazing and turned into a 6-7 Months Daily Adventure Quest. Clean as Fuck, Clear Headed (Sometimes), and MASSIVE Energy to just big a Kid. I fucking loved it. Even 5-10MGs of what I had was a good time and Excellent Anti-Depressant. THANK YOU to that Chemist for doing his job Proper.


I found this random Article about what these could be Referred To : A form of daily Disassociation that take places and gradually builds over years called - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maladaptive_daydreaming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maladaptive_daydreaming)  "Maladaptive Daydreaming". I've had every symptom of this condition at various points since 10/11 years old - My head stayed in the Clouds. Very wild to think - depending on what everyone else's perception about this circumstance is...O-PCE could create this condition or intensify an already present world of Mental Illusions. Just wanted to share. Strange Shit!

I wanted to ask You Dr Mamba - if You felt at different points in Your trip like it was almost a Mental Intelligence/Self Awareness/Wordly Awareness TEST being given to You in your Mind/Consciousness or Auditory Senses as well? I made it quite far past the Psychedelic/Mania Period of O-PCE and into another world for a bit, but whatever "Test" I was given - which had some fucking dark and hard to handle questions and circumstances at different moments, it supplied me with a level of Self Confidence and a NEW take on Life in General that remains to this day. And once the Test was over on June 6th,2018 - I've never again felt the semi-intense at times Questioning and Exam that I felt like I participating willingly or unwillingly in at times. Since it ended after the strange Synchronicity of WAY too many days, nights and otherwise - I've been at Peace, Mentally, Physically, and Spiritually. It was a beautiful Journey that may have finally helped me Grow into the "Adult" version of myself if You will at 35.


Any Similar Experiences? This compound is a fucking speedy HEADTRIP! Safe Travels and Disco Daydreaming - Don't get too Lost.


Peace - Mr. Meowfish....

I'm very inexperienced with disso's, and at first I didn't like 'em. Too confusing, heavy bodyload, not really euphoric for me in any way.


But I took 12mg orally, and about 2 hours later I snorted about 4mg more, I liked the manic edge the snorting had, and it sort of allowed me to put the headspace O-PCE has to use I guess.

I could evaluate my life from a very objective standpoint, like what is in store for me in the future, my relationship to some people, what I want in life etc...

It was actually quite rewarding, in a very different way to serotonergic psychedelics, which I'm much more experienced with. 


I combined it with weed, which I normally NEVER smoke, simply because I don't really enjoy it like I used to anymore, it certainly made it even more confusing.


One 'complaint' though was that talking was incredibly difficult for me, I have a little stutter anyway and almost all drugs make it much worse, but this one takes the cake, couldn't form sentences at all ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I would consider myself a disso lover even though I've really only tried a half dozen different ones. The vast bulk of my expereinces being with ketas and also MXE which I would say are both gems and had many great times with. I still get some theraptic benefits in terms of depression and anxiety with the other few dissos I've dabled in but they seem more like specialised research projects that are a bit hit and miss or a plan for the end of the world kind of thing like if everything goes t!ts up and MXE and Ketas are not available can I still get some theraputic benefit from the newer dissos?!?


2'-Oxo-PCE so far I've used 3 or 4 times. At 10mg and one 20mg dose. I've even had one 10mg dose with combos of MXE. So far it rates at 2nd from the bottom of the half dozen dissos I've tried. It's not as good as I was expecting. Kind of a weird somewhat smashy feeling. I think it feels a little warmer and a little more guiding thoughts than 3-MeO-PCP (not that I've tried that one more than once or twice though) but probably not a hell of a lot. I've not been game to try holing on this yet though just becuase on it's own so far with my current set & setting there is a level of uncomforatable weirdness or slight anxiety that I'm not sure if it will get worse.


The combo of the 10mg 2'-Oxo-PCE with small bumps of MXE (around 15-25mg each bump) was very positive but this isn't saying much as I already find MXE generally very positive. If anything there was still some distinct visual and emotional weirness I associate with the 2'-Oxo-PCE but just smoothed over more from the MXE. The only really weird part happened was when I decided to benzo out and get sleep early only to realise that I was not able to sleep and there was weird side effects in my body. I was really having to constantly stop myself from flailing around in bed. Like I mean my limbs just wanted to flail around and do the drunken monkey. Also my mouth and facial expressions wanted to do the "messy raver". Like I had to consciously make myself stop or my mouth would do weird gurning movements like as if I'd chewed way too many disco biscuits. I put this one down to trying to sleep much too early on in the disso expereince with benzos, the benzos and the dissos fighting eachother and the benzos not winning. In a foolish choice I ended up finally getting up and smoking some shard until I finally felt sobre enough that my balance and composure was fully regained and no more spastic limb movements or gurning was going on. I quickly regretted it though like most m-amp experiences end up for me. M-amp athough fun and maybe somewhat even theraputic and for sure social on the outset quickly turn me more deflated than I started out and often with more anxiety or depression than I started with. I guess I've come to realise maybe it's called "shabs" for a reason, not just becuase it's short for shabu but also because it's short for how I often feel when it's at the tail end which is pretty shabby. ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)

I personally haven't tried this one over 5mg, though I have some.  Not sure why not, I guess I just don't care for dissos nearly as much as I used to (except MXE... god I love that drug).

What do we know about the metabolism of eticyclodone?  Do we know what this breaks down into, and by what pathways?


  Also, do we have any information about the max solubility, say in something like propylene glycol?  


The literature is scant, or else paywalled, so I was hoping some of you might have something to say.

The combination of 2-Oxo-PCE and 2C-B/E is by far the best drug combination I've discovered to date. Total brain hack.


I've been into this combo for years now. It's great via any ROA, from oral to IV (my two preferred MOs, but it works well with any ROA).


It can be complemented by a little MDMA, the only issue with that is TOO MUCH EUPHORIA.


It makes shooting any combination of meth, coke and heroin look ridiculously dull. There's just nothing like it. Pure ecstasy at lower doses, deeply spiritual when using 2C-E and a dominating 2-Oxo-PCE dose.


I recently ran out of 2-Oxo-PCE (bought 2g years ago) and had to resort to using pharmaceutical grade racemic ketamine from the pharmacy for my monthly adventures. Worst thing that's ever happened to me, to give you an idea how much I love this stuff.


Found another 85mg. Best thing that's ever happened to me in my entire life. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


I'm not sure how many times I've mentioned this or if ever at all, but it can't be said enough:


This combo is the fucking shit. The one drug combination to end all drug combinations.


Disclaimer: I have a tendency to use superlatives inflationarily when it comes to dissociative drug preferences (but this shit really is the shit).

MXE changed my life, and was my favorite (and main drug) for about 7 years. When it went away, and I had to resort to K, things went to shit as well.

It was ok (though inferior) for a while, but then after some life events when it was more "needed" it became hard to manage.


I still use K, but only get a gram at a time. Any more just turns into a destructive binge and any benefit is far overridden by turning into a fiend. Easy access has it's downsides.


O-PCE is the only thing I've found in the ballpark of MXE for treatment resistant depression and compared to K, I don't find it fiendy at all. Yes, it calls to me, but I won't continually do it until it's gone.


Unlike MXE, where I've gone into some very far out places, I've kept the dosage pretty low with O-PCE, around 12-14mg, with minimal re-dosing (I have a decent tolerance to dissos).

Partly it could be from getting older and being less experimental, but I tend to think this compound shines in the lower dosage. Reading this thread has also made me more cautious.


One main difference with MXE, is for me, I find the effects happen in reverse.

MXE is a dissociative state followed by an extremely clean/clear mental stimulation, whereas O-PCE is the opposite,


Both have advantages/disadvantages. One of my favorite things about MXE, especially by itself, is that I usually feel better, and more clear-headed at the end of a night. At Shambhala (back in the day), I only took MXE 3 nights in a row, and it was perfect. Taking anything else just seemed like a downgrade.


But when I've taken MXE after alcohol, the initial dissociative effect makes things very sloppy. I'm a non-smoker (totally now), but at the time I socially smoked and a few puffs of a cigarette with MXE/alcohol would have me unable to stand and in a different world.


In contrast, I find alcohol, then low dose O-PCE very synergistic, almost "magical" as the alcohol loosens the mind and inhibitions, but O-PCE makes it razor sharp. But make the mistake of re-dosing O-PCE as more alcohol is kicking in, and the initial dose is fading to the dissociative aspect and shit can go downhill really fast.


Another issue with MXE and likely O-PCE is that it's pharmacologically more complex than ketamine (NMDA only for the most part). The problem is that the NMDA tolerance builds first, which leads to re-dosing, and the secondary (serotonergic, etc.) effects seem cumulative. I've experienced some scary states when re-dosing MXE and mixing with other monoamine releasing/re-uptake inhibiting substances (my sample size is large). Sometimes, even when I'm comparatively sober something just clicks in my body and I quickly get confused and panicked (not just a panic attack). Trippy states I can handle, but this feels physical. I got some cyproheptadine (serotonin syndrome antidote), which seems like a very useful tool for the "toolbox", but as I've had similar states with K, I have a hypothesis it might be due to a change in the body's potassium/sodium balance (some research seems to support this). I went to the ER one time (thanks universal health care), and the only thing I remember was something related to potassium. In these confused states when I know I have little time to think clearly I've instinctively eaten a banana. A confounding factor in my case is possibly adrenal fatigue from long-term kratom use, stress/trauma (and minor amphetamine usage) causing a dysfunction of aldosterone which regulates potassium/sodium balance and fluid balance. Total "bro-science", but I'm posting this for posterity, in the off chance I'm on to something. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


My appetite for experimenting with random RCs has significantly reduced since my early days, so I could be missing out on some great new chems, but for me, MXE in 2010, and O-PCE in 2017 have been my last great discoveries.


I really hope this one hasn't gone the way of MXE. MXE is banned in China and also by the UN so unlikely to make a comeback (synth is too hard to scale), and while O-PCE hasn't been officially restricted as far as I know, it's possible that it became popular in China (as the obvious successor of MXE), and a domestic crackdown will lead to it's demise. The Chinese government even tried to remove Ketamine from the UN's essential medicine list, so they won't hesitate to take action when something becomes "popular" domestically (another random theory).


(Btw, if anyone's experienced this very distinct state I mentioned, let me know, I really want to understand it from harm reduction/pharmacology perspective...)

e1evene1ven, can you tell me more about cyproheptadine and why it should work as an "antidote" to serotonin syndrome?


On topic, I've found that it's incredibly important to take care of basic health and nutrition while using dissociative drugs. Keeping a regular sleep schedule, exercising, eating a healthy diet.. when the basics are taken care of, I never get any real negative effects from binging these drugs.

That's easy. It's because it's the standard pharmacological treatment for serotonin syndrome that hospitals use for moderate to severe cases.


It's an old school drug with other effects, and there are more targeted serotonin antagonists which may be better suited, but this does the trick.

In Canada at least, it's also easy to get. OTC, but special order. I just went to the nearest location of the largest pharmacy chain, they put in an order, and it was there to pick up in a few hours.


For my own piece of mind, I think it's a useful addition to my psychonaut toolkit. Risperidone, ketanserin, and actiavated charcoal are others which I hope to never need, but feel better having (the latter would negate the former).

In nearly all situations benzos would still be the initial go to, unless the shit really hits the fan. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


Since I don't actually know exactly what's causing things, I usually resort to a little bit of everything. I'd take half of less of a 4mg pill. Over the years, I've become better at recognizing the early onset of this, but when it fully kicks in I know I have a very limited time before I'm too confused to think clearly  Most of these these alarming experiences involved re-dosed MXE with other monoamine drugs which had me leaning towards the mild serotonin syndrome hypothesis, but having the same thing with K led me more towards the idea it could be related to non-addison's adrenal deficiency and lower aldosterone (which regulates potassium/sodium balance) amplifying K/MXE's effect on potassium which probably isn't a problem for most people. Both ideas are pure speculation.


Another huge thing that I don't think many people know about is Hapé (properly spelled with an R, and pronounced haa-pay, but ya know). Amazonian mapcho based snuff. It can pretty much kill a K trip in 2-3 minutes (similar to how tobacco is used to chill aya trips). I haven't tested with dissociatives with more complex pharmacology than K, but it's reliable for me and close friends (discovered after meeting a random smart person at a festival that accurately described it as "ketamine's kryptonite"). Based on my experience Hapé would be my first choice before benzos. A cold shower (or head wetting) also can be very helpful. Buckets of cold water over the head is something I first experienced in Peru, and based on Wim Hof related reseach it seems to be a decent way to help the body reset. 


> The serotonin antagonist cyproheptadine is the recommended initial therapy, although there have been no [controlled trials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled_trials) demonstrating its efficacy for serotonin syndrome.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome#cite_note-Isbister_Buckley-7)[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome#cite_note-Graudins-54)[[55]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome#cite_note-55) Despite the absence of controlled trials, there are a number of case reports detailing apparent improvement after people have been administered cyproheptadine.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome#cite_note-Isbister_Buckley-7) Animal experiments also suggest a benefit from serotonin antagonists.[[56]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome#cite_note-56) Cyproheptadine is only available as tablets and therefore can only be administered orally or via a [nasogastric tube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasogastric_tube); it is unlikely to be effective in people administered [activated charcoal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activated_charcoal) and has limited use in severe cases.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome#cite_note-Isbister_Buckley-7) Cyproheptadine can be stopped when the person is no longer experiencing symptoms and the half life of serotonergic medications already passed.[[57]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome#cite_note-57) {/quote]

I am not sure which state you are referring to in the end, the alcohol 2-Oxo-PCE combo? All I know is that it makes me feel like it's Christmas Eve. Seriously. I'm not into low dissociative doses though.

Thank you! Eventhough I may not be around much, it always feels like coming home. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


So I had like 3 IV doses of 2-Oxo-PCE (85mg) left and 40mg 2C-B as well. I was gonna go for two more rides before I ran out, but made a mistake preparing the combo, ending up with a surplus of 2C-B in the mix which made it impossible to inject. However the solution was still very much suited for oral use.


I didn't like the idea, but boy did I miss out in these past years. Fuck needles.


I came to decide to brew a magic potion, consisting of various psychedelics, dissociatives and maybe low dose MDMA/opiates. So far there are 7 substances in there and my wife and I absolutely loved our first experiment. This is gonna be my project now lol. It shall never run empty and hopefully there will be dozens of substances in there when I leave it to my grand children some day. :D Go harm reduction.


Anyway, the experience was so good in fact, that I decided it's time to turn my back to needles (not categorically and indefinitely, just for the time being until I change my mind).


I started experimenting a little with 5-MeO-MiPT which is good in it's own way.


However a couple of days ago I had a few friends who I have known for almost 30 years over at my place. They had their wives with them. I don't see them very often since one of them lives abroad. We cooked, ate and drank and I ended up slightly drunk when they left.


So... What do I usually do when I'm drunk? Yeah, you might've guessed it: Drugs. 2C-P in this case. It had me crying for ten hours straight until I could barely breathe, the entire nasal passage clogged with thick slimy snot., that's how beautiful it was. GOD


Long story short... I'm back to where I started 20 years ago. Psychedelics. Why did I ever get started with needles and blackout dissociative doses when these beautiful serotonergic chemicals have always been in my possession? This, too, feels like coming home. God I've missed them.


[@Xorkoth](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/77889/)

I've had this 2C-P laying around for years now and I can say that there are few psychedelics out there as amazing as this one. It puzzles me that it's so underrepresented in terms of experience reports. If you ever get the chance, GRAB SOME! I never had the time to go for DOC which has always been one of my favourites. This one is every bit as intense though and will be my go-to psychedelic until it's gone (not much left).

It took me roughly eight years to try it, since people didn't give it much credit. Also because it is supposed to last an eternity, but I suppose those are exaggerations. You can easily go to sleep at night if you take it early in the day. I could imagine going hiking on a lower dose sometime. But well... Summer is nearing it's end. GOnna have to hope for some nice sunny autumn days and I'm off into the woods. 


Thanks to that app "komoot" I finally found plenty of beautiful spots in Germany's north where my wife and I (and sometimes my daughter) can go walk/hike for hours on end without coming across any people. Never knew this region could be so beautiful.


It's funny how most people (me included) always long to leave the country to find beautiful places, when so many stunning landscapes can be found right at our doorstep. Well almost, I rarely have to drive for more than an hour.

O-PCE is likely in my top 5 drugs of all-time despite having only used relatively low doses (~10-14mg + a similar redose with a decent disso tolerance). I have a close friend who feels the same.

Interesting anecdote, when I met very well-known psychonaut/chemist last year (to remain unnamed for privacy), it was the only thing I had to offer, and while he didn't partake due to having an early flight he also expressed it being his current favorite drug to my surprise.


After finding a small stash of MXE recently, I think I actually prefer O-PCE, at least in lower doses. It feels more functional and clear-headed. But after a year of regular K issue however, I'm unable to compare things at baseline.


Also after reading some of the speculation on O-PCE being potentially risky with regular use do to hypothetical antibacterial/antimicrobial properties, I'm a bit more risk-averse with it. If anyone has a definitive rebuttal to these claims, I'd love to know (probably discussed to death here, but I've been out of the loop). The study published in HK showing a large cluster of adverse effects is another reason I want to be cautious and not assume it has same relative safety as MXE.

##### Cluster of acute poisonings associated with an emerging ketamine analogue, 2-oxo-PCE - PubMed

Ketamine and phencyclidine are well-known drugs of abuse of the arylcyclohexylamine class, the backbone of which is used for the synthesis of new psychoactive substances (NPS). In October 2017, a cluster of acute intoxications was encountered where patients presented with ketamine-like...

					www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
				


At that this point it seems to be a gone for now, so I've been dabbling with 3-MeO-PCE. My initial impression is that it lacks much of the magic of O-PCE, and has less of the perfect hypo-mania (in contrast to the more forceful and less forgiving raw power of 3-MeO-PCP), it's still quite well-rounded, and may be the best thing available (for me at least at this point).


Based on the receptor affinity studies, 3-MeO-PCE/O-PCE seem to share MXE's far more complex pharmacology compared ketamine which make them 'deeper' in many respects, but with more room for unexpected interactions and risks when the tolerance to the NMDA effects builds rapidly, while the secondary effects can be cumulative with re-dosing...


(Btw Xorkoth, I wrote you a long PM, but it got lost before I sent it ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png) I'll try again soon)

Found my sweet spot at slightly below the doses Of take when using the substances on their own. IV 17mg with 3mg 2C-E right after 8mg oral/rectal.


Comes out to roughly 35mg+12mg orally, the latter of which is a pretty standard dose for people who aren't used to tripping. So for 2C-B I'd use 4.5mg IV or 18mg orally. 


Anymore psychedelic and I'll vomit, anymore dissociative and I'll get amnesia. Any less psychedelic and the trip won't be colorful enough for my taste, less dissociative will have me 'remain in this world '. It's very tricky to get the doses right for the type of experience I'm usually seeking. It took a lot of trial and error to figure them out, which took many months filled with disappointments, since I can't use them as often due to having to have my wife be ok with the frequency. She hates seeing me on dissociatives, understandably so. 


Back when I first met her she had never come in contact with psychedelic drugs. The third or fourth time I saw her I arrived bleeding from my broken elbow after crashing my bicycle into a traffic light lol, without even realizing the damage. 


It's a miracle she didn't reject me after that happened, since I always considered her slightly out of my league. It sure took some fighting to have her marry me and it was a rock road to get to where we are now, but I digress.

Is it just me, or does O-PCE induce tinnitus more than other dissociatives?


I'm starting to grow fond of it, but if the above is true then I need to get into benzos again to knock myself out at night, because the sounds are keeping me up and CBD ain't cuttin' it..


Thoughts?

Really weird substance, i tested various dosages 10, 20 and 30mg. On its own you will walk around in a grayish world of wonder with weird insights and stories around the corner. It feels very gentle, very spiritual, to bad it takes so long to wear off. I feel it is less safe than ketamine.

However when I combined 20mg o-pce with 10mg of 3-ho-pcp I had a massive hole, ego death and all and got physically raped by a beautiful futa(!?) demon for my sins. I dunno what to say, this was the weirdest experience ever. I submitted to it and I am on team light bringer now apparently.


Back to reality I feel fine though. I guess I will use this sparingly from now on. It truly shattered my ideas on reality.


EDIT: I haven't gone psychotic btw I am working and feeling fine, the experience just was very, very, very real. Been a few days. I dunno.

Did some more tests with this substance. It is a very fun, but heavy substance. It truly is a DRUG and not just a drug. It is what you think a drug should be if you are 8.


I did 40mg, which is the highest I want to go for now. Going to take a break on it though. I have quite some time on hand and work is not that demanding due to the crisis, so why not.


Ok, so my experience. I haven't got a timeline, but it was, I guess, very spiritual and very personal on many levels. I am not a spiritual person btw, I am an agnost. And while this experience did change me, it didn't change that.


I was walking in the garden and I thought I died and was in some sort of Eden. Everything was really beautiful. The trees were shaped like females, in the sky the clouds where laughing creatures, also very beautiful. I talked with a lot of them in my head and we talked about the nature of human experience and morality, which was really interesting. Apparently there are two factions, which have a quarrel. The first faction believes morality is an external thing, something which has to be learned from others. The other faction believes that morality is internal and you should define your own values. They both agree that you should make yourself better according to your own morality.

They also explained that while the internal path is more dangerous, it is not wrong perse. It is a valid choice. It is more dangerous, because you have no real reference if what you think is right is actually right. However most of the what we consider bad people are from the more dangerous path, so there are more people straying and that is a sad thing. I learned I am of the latter category and should be extra alert on how I think about the world. They also revealed some very personal stuff. Something really clicked here in my head.


I guess the take away was, it is ok to not be religious or believe in an universal morality, but you are on you own then. You have to be careful, try to be the best you are and try to become better.


I thanked them and just watched the sky, see them play around. Then I was purified somehow after I made a deal and this has had lasting changes on me.


When the effects died down a bit and I felt not so out of it, back to reality. I decided to interact with the family. I had fun with the kids. We had discussions about mathematics and philosophy, something they seem to like. We had fun building a hut and I then slept very well.


It was a great day really.


EDIT: I build up quite some tolerance by now, so 40mg is no way a good starter dose!

Wow, sounds like an intense experience.  I have only tried this up to 5mg... I'm not the biggest dissociative fan overall and I'm not too keen on a really heavy one, and everyone pretty unanimously says this is very heavy stuff.

I have a 5-6 positive experiences with small doses of powder PCP (mesc/mess, as it is known in eastern canada....everybody knows it is not the cactus thing though...it was the meth before meth pills showed up, it's gotten a lot more rare after the '00s). A friend has some 3-meo-PCE and some O-PCE and some DCK. Which is the mildest and least long lasting? I haven't had a dissociative trip in a very long time, it was either DXM or PCP, so I want to go and have a small kick at it. I had one line of K in 2011 that was about 150mg, I felt it, I got the PCP vibe where I turn so good at games that require precision, pool or even guitar hero, I would empty tables and beat scores when I got in that strange ultra confident/no-shaking zone that PCP and apparently K also brought me to. You can put them in order, that would help. Thanks.

Damn guys, it's tumbleweeds quiet here since 6 months. My friend won't be in town for more than 2 days, he's gonna give me a little of each if I can't decide. It seems O-PCE is one that is easy to take too much and pee-holed big time and that in "microdoses" it acts like PCP, stimulating by dissociating you from your insecurities and such. 3-meo-pcp seems to be manic inducing which isn't too good for me, so unless I figure out what dose is a safe one that won't send me into mania (Bip 1) big time, especially don't want any hypomania. If benzos help, then I'm fine with that, I got my bromazepam and diazepam scripts, I can take more than the doctor ordered a few times a week without too much issues. The DCK, he's really not into giving me more than one dose, as he doesn't know if he'll even be able to get any again.

3-MeO-PCE is for sure the most mania inducing one, although hypomania is a 'risk' with all dissos ime. 


O-PCE is very strong and long, trust psychonautwiki in it's dosages. Never tried DCK so I can't comment on it, but I imagine it to be ketamine like.

Thank you both. I wish I could find a place that would sell 3-HO-PCP to me, it's as easy to cut with lactose as with the classic powder pcp we had in the streets for decades in Canada, I guess it's still around but pretty rare, I don't hang out with 15 year old punks these days so I wouldn't know :D . I think I might get O-PCE and just go for slight doses, PCP-like doses, 5-10mg and see. I'll give some feedback. I tripped only once in 18 months, last fall, had some 4-HO-DPT and had a blast, we made a fire on top of a small mountain in town, a spot psychonauts enjoy a lot around here, it takes some effort to get there, but we get one hell of a view of almost all of town. Right now it's too slushy from melting snow and not very warm, dissos do well with stayin at home, I'm not in some complete ridiculous lockdown US state, my province is sending primary school kids back in a week, but temperature has been cold AF until about 3-4 days so there's still a lot of snow that would've melted had the temps not gone down below 0C for 2 weeks. I desperately am waiting for summer. Anyways, thanks again. More info welcome meanwhile. I intend on taking the O-PCE (likely) saturday.

The weird thing with o-pce is that you don't feel drugged in low dosages, you feel normal, but that is a lie. Don't believe it for one bit. For the rest it is great stuff, really deep.

That being said, I am still not touching it for a long while. I am still gathering the pieces of what I think of reality. On high dosages it can change you, not in a bad way perse, but be careful.

Don't worry, I've seen what was my best friend go cray-cray from just plain old school canadian PCP paste (the thing used to make 15g of powder) used everyday for a couple weeks, with 15 LSD blotter thrown on top, it was both hilarious when told as a story but awful for his friends to deal with, thankfully he wasn't afraid of me and of his girlfriend's friend, so we calmed him down but he still ended up "giving himself up" to the cops so that "they would remove the mics and cameras from the cracks in the walls of his apartment and that he flushed all his hash and weed" and that's the short of it, I told that story on here before a few times likely in full detail. Let's just say the cops laughed at him as he walked to the station to give himself up, they just sent him to the hospital to have his blood detoxed and be fed some food for a few days. That was in 2001 before 9/11 so I guess it was different times then, not sure what cops would do now with a similar case. I've been a bit cray-cray from a bit too much DXM powder too back in that time frame back in 2001, nothing like that, just sayin that wanting to reach that "fourth plateau" is not fun at all, the fun with DXM sits with "2nd plateau" dosages and weed, which changes its character a lot, and preferably from pure powder put in capsules, meds with just the thing now all have insane amounts of sorbitol that will make one sick. I managed to get some of this but also DCK, too bad for the 3-meo-pce, I don't feel like having any hypomania, so goddamn uncomfortable...

MXE will always be my favorite


That said o-pce is the best hole I ever hit.....just insane.....just lasts too damned long.....the tail on it is very uncomfortable and lasts hours.....


Of course I also consume ethanol every day and cannabis, so....

Was never the same...a tried and true hole that was just glorious.....

O-PCE is the phenyl analog of Tiletamine (O-TCE). everybody has ragged on Tiletamine about how horribly inferior to Ketamine it is. While that may be, I found in my personal experimentation O-TCE superior to O-PCE. Both hover around "90% as good as MXE" (I had access to MXE until november 2019). What I like better about O-PCE is the longer plateau, what I like better about O-TCE are the clean anesthetic plunges you make with rectal use, its like collapsing into a singularity, and the stronger hallucinogenic effects.

What is the most efficient method of storing these compounds long term, friends? Looking to make it last, volumetric dosing would be nice too but if powder, and dessicant is better for like longevity...? Anyone

It's always better for longevity to store things dry.  Keep away from light, heat and moisture.  Small amber vials is how I roll.  dissos in the ACH family (like this) are quite stable.  


If you want to use volumetric dosing, store dry, and make solutions with, say, 50-100mg at a time, and store those in the refrigerator.  I have several grams of DOC as I was able to get it cheap and it's one of the best drugs in existence IMO.  I make 1mg/mL solutions with 30mg at a time and keep the rest dry.  I could pass it on to my great-grandkids, if I had any kids.

dear  Friends, can you give me some links to receptor afinity and metabolism for o-pce, i research the microcosmos with this mystical molecule and need more input.

first: especially on the hypothetical possibility of immune modulation


and I am interested in the osmotic facts about the possible metabolites due to possible aggression against the bladder tissue.

Unfortunately I don't have a laboratory and have to collect everything.


which metabolite has the strongest AMPA affinity?


and finally:

there could be neuroprotective metabolites / derivatives that, like memantine, stop or slow down Alzheimer's dementia.


I know there are a lot of questions, but you are the best crush knowledge internationally.

IMO best stuff around, just in the middle of ket and PCP, very potent, can be mystic and give delusion of grandeur, the "trip" is not to short- not to long, can sleep after, stuff to stock.

It's similar to MXE only in that a kind of hole is possible, and more stuff happens behind the eyes than happens with K, or 3-MeO-PCP. Personally, I'm not a big fan. It's really cold to me, unnecessarily confusing (though not as much as MXPr), far too stimulating for a more hole-y kind of disso, and generally just leaves me feeling inhuman in a bad way.

Really? This stuff has legs for me and is so hard to sleep after. If I remember correctly, it's like 8+ hours until I can sleep after a nice dose of it.

**What is the most efficient method of storing these compounds long term, friends? **


I found that, after 8 years of storage in essential oil vials in the freezer as dry MXE.HCL, there was NO potency loss. Likely, if you store any arylcyclohexylamine dry and airtight in the freezer at under 20'C, it keeps for decades.

Thing is, you can toe the line only so long with dissociatives before you cant use them anymore because of compulsive redosing, addiction, physical and psychological complications, peeing out your bladder or weirding out.

You're finding this stuff easy to sleep afterward???

I've read on reddit about 2 different batches that were synthed...one was "slow" o-pce (sedating) and the other was "fast" (stimulating).

Dont know what to make of the reddit post honestly.

With quite a tolerance I found surprisingly easy to sleep  on this, but with no tolerance it can get quite insomniac. YMMV. What other users thought?

I'm debating whether I should buy o-pce or 3-Meo-pce. Which one is more clearheaded and euphoric? I enjoyed 3-meo-pcp when I would received the brown/tan batch, but the pure white one felt like a different compound entirely as it induced a Clinically cold Experience prone to nasty side effects.

3-MeO-PCE is definitely more clearheaded, but I think on euphoria both are a safe bet. O-PCE is just devilishly moreish, and it will kick your ass if you don't respect it enough. 3-MeO-PCE for me was a bit lacklustre, it had some euphoria and most of all made time race by.


O-PCE is very potent, kind of feels like a mix of psychedelics, downers and stims. The hole is really intense, and long lasting. Interesting but dangerous to anyone with a high disso tolerance, imho.

I find for myself that the hole only lasts around an hour or so I did 40mg rectal last night and had a glorious hole thst was very quantum mechanical and biomedical in nature but I was out of it after around an hour ...this stuff is soooo clear headed except during the peak. 

This is my favorite material even more so than MXE because if I dose at midnight I'm.nearly back to baseline by morning.  And I can still accomplish tasks after the hole even though im.sluggish and get confused. 

But this stuff takes me to the exact same place in the hole every single time.

Thoughts of quantum mechanics,  microcosms and macrocosms, beings existing  in between dimensions and the purpose of all this (life) consistently ruminate in my brain while I'm holing on this stuff.

Makes me feel like I'm in a futuristic dimension that's only accessible via this chemical though I've gone to the exact place a few times on MXE.

This is a sacred technology....this not a typical drug. This is something extraordinary and special. 

It also consistantly motivates me to self improve immediately following the hole....like I jump out of my caccon of bed covers and just start working on projects even though I'm still heavily fucked up but I typically spend the rest of the night getting shit done.

Never taken a chemical that brings such motivation on the come down.

Just magical material!!! I think I like this more than my beloved 4acodpt!!!

I'm feeling pretty satisfied right now. Ordered 5 tabs of al-lad, 250 mg of 4-ho-met, 1 g of 5-mapb, and to top it all off 1g of 3-Meo-pcp  How friendly do you guys think these compounds are to each other? I've heard various reports about these particular combos and they all seemed worthwhile.


 Invariably I'll have some Etizolam as well because I forgot how to navigate my trip like a normal person. 10-11 years ago I could devour copious amounts of various psychs with impunity. I'd be completely content with the chaotic madness unfolding before my eyes. Now, after many bad trips and a worsening anxiety-depression disorder I can't take the plunge without one.

Had another profound hole on 40mg rectally administered..

For some reason the entire hole was centered around this movie which I watched on regular acid years ago...

The themes in this movie (in terms of gestation, life cycles, what's really real..., control, manipulation,  freedom,  independence,  cellular growth,  new life forms, etc, etc,..

I'm not entirely sure why yet but scenes   and concepts from this film  keep occurring in my arylcycholhexelamine holes....

Especially MXE and O-PCE...

The hole seems to be trying to tell me something thsts thematically related to this very strange film.

For some reason I feel.that there is some strange correlation between the chemicals MXE/ O-PCE and the film UPSTREAM COLOR thematically...

Hey guys, hope things are good.


I'm really struggling to get anything out of this after it popped up with a generally legit UK connect who does good MDMA and psychs (including some now rare 2cx's which popped up from the same  guy). Looking at what the incredibly active dosage charts portray I don't want to have some kind of entity hole when I was just expecting a bit of dissociative stimulation/euphoria/weird thoughts etc). I basically want pre-hole, not a hole. But I can't find either.


I do have ketamine tolerance from this year, especially since lockdown, but I find it resets after about a few days to a week. Then I can go from doing a few decent sized lines amounting to a few hundred milligram to feel a bit ketted, to having a break and a little bump & having total cognitive impairment, existential thoughts, etc.


Unfotunately wedinos is currently un-operational:

Anyway I will report what I've been feeling since Monday, after perhaps 4-7 days ketamine abstinence.


60mg O-PCE in 60ml Propylene glycol


Tuesday: 5mg/5ml: Possibly a light uplift?

Wednesday: 7.5mg/7.5ml: possibly another uplift. Felt nice, floaty. Hard to tell both times from placebo as it was so  borderline.

Thursday: Getting bored of the oral dosing/titrating. plus I love snorting and this stuffs easy on the nose. if 30mg~ is a hole, I figure I'll weigh out 20mg, split it into four and snort each as the other kicks in. I did this over 2 hours. Even threw in a 10mg morphine to see if I could move things along. Pretty much nothing. Felt Okay but it was late and I had to go to bed. Still not sure if I'm just struggling to know what I'm looking for.

Friday (today): 10ml/10mg orally in the morning. Nothing much. This afternoon, I took this intranasenally, all about 15 minutes apart:


Weighed out 28mg:

1. 7mg nasal 

2. 7mg nasal

3. 7mg nasal

4. 7mg nasal


Nothing much so made another 28mg.

1. 7mg

2. 7mg


I think I can feel something very slight. My headspace is perhaps changed. 


3. Just had another 7mg and have another racked up; unsure what it will do. Finding this so frustrating. 


Any advice?

Hey Tranced, long time no see. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


That sounds suspect, honestly.  7mg of this stuff nasally, and I start getting wonky, it's really potent.  It kinda sounds like this is a bad batch or misrepresented.  But maybe you should try doing a larger amount all at once before writing it off?

Yea 7mg is a light to medium strength dose for me, if I remember correctly. 15mg was a full enough experience.

Looking at what the incredibly active dosage charts portray I don't want to have some kind of entity hole when I was just expecting a bit of dissociative stimulation/euphoria/weird thoughts etc). I basically want pre-hole, not a hole. But I can't find either.

I've honestly not even bothered trying this stuff intranasallly because it's so magnificent via rectal admin that I dont have any desire to explore other ROA's (though I initially started trials orally).

I dont feel.that this chemical has any recreational potential honestly....this is not a functional disso whatsoever. 

In my experience,  it's purely for holing which works 100% of the time via rectal administration. 

I'm curious about how it might combine with psychedelics bit I havent had the time to do psychedelics at all this year (I make hospital equipment and covid has ramped production up like crazy).

No idea what's up with your batch though 30mg should have you at least near the hole...I typically take one single 40mg dose rectally and hole within  15-30 mins and I'm out of the hole in 60-120 mins then start coming back to baseline....and immediately begin cleaning, organizing   working out  thinking about what I need to do get my life on a better track and I've been intensely focused on self improvement since I've explored this chemical. 

My opinion  is this is not a party drug or a mood enhancer   it's like going to the Oracle of Delphi and asking for advice and you actually get it every single time....tonight the Oracle told me I should be careful not to overdo it with this chemical, that I'm standing on the shoulders of many, many,many who came before me and failed by abusing this sacrament. 

Imho this stuff is like the disso version of DMT.  Or that the hole that I have experienced on this is spiritually on par with my spiritual experiences smoking DMT.

With this material you truly need to think about what you experienced in the hole and integrate it before your next trial.

Deffo powerful stuff. 14mgs should put you near hole or directly in hole territory even with decent tolerance, so your 30-50mgs doses with barely effects points to bad material

One of my favorites. Kind of went overboard with it at the start where I dosed near 100mg and ended in hospital completely fucked.


Since then I am interested in low doses daily as well as the vaping/IM roa.

I yet again ruined my life with this and am now homeless. Obviously it was my doing. I had etizolam in my system and i for some reason decided to snort a very decent amount of it. Id say fuck i don't know at least fifty milligrams. If not more probably more it was quite big. And stupid. I woke up in hospital.


I won't say the whole report here unless anyones interested in more.


So yeah second time since June. Why do i keep doing this to myself? Wish I knew...


O-PCE is the most blackout inducing disso I find, benzo or not. Its very potent. Don't do what I did and mix drugs. Especially these classes. I could blame the etizolam clouding my judgenent but it was ME.


Extreme caution must be used with this disso. Its the most "hardcore' of dissos ive found.


Obligatory i miss you know what....

Let me just say that I've been using O-PCE since april 2016 on and off. I've had some overdoses, one that led to a seizure when mixed with 4-AcO-DMT. Actually bad things happened pretty often when I mixed it with tryptamines, even if the bad was just a bad trip. I've had reality do some weird shit. I used to plug this drug a lot, but eventually I stopped holing and started just blacking out. 50mg is a black out-come to dose for me. 


Overtime, I've decided to just stop plugging dissos. I've also learned to be more cautious. An unknown dose of insufflated 3-MeO-PCP in 2020 led to kidney failure and a NDE that resulted in multiple seizures and a coma that lasted a few days. Wild experience. I've become much more tame since then. The only dissos I've plugged since the overdose is MXPr, which is fantastic when mixed with 5-MAPB. Absolutely incredible. Also mixed 2F-DCK with 3-CL-PCP last fall and that was an amazing ride. I believe it was 200mg 2F + 30mg 3-CL-PCP. I digress...


What I'm trying to say is that as someone which lots of experience taking big doses, I've found my life changes in very positive ways when I stick to small doses instead. Some of the best progress I ever made in life was in 2018 using O-PCE exclusively. I'd wake up every day and snort a 5-7mg little line, then weight two 10mg doses, wrap them in foil and take them with me to work. (office job) throughout the day, I'd open the foil, press my finger on a small shard (I had little rock of it) and take another 5mg or so. I'd save the last bit for yoga after work. 


This went on all of summer into fall. In that time, I found myself in the best shape of my life. I stopped drinking alcohol entirely and smoking weed entirely. I got my credit score over 600 for the first time in years. I started reading books again and stopped going out to party as much. This all fell apart once I started mixing it with 4-HO-MiPT then eventually had a series of bad experiences and threw away what I had. After that I started drinking again and everything went back to the way it was. When I started using dissos again in 2019, it was 3-MeO-PCP, 3-MeO-PCE and DXM, all of which I overdosed on at some point. None were nearly as clean or productive. 


The last disso I did was DMXE, which was very similar to MXE, but way too greyscale and gloomy for me. I forgot MXE can be like that, for me anyway. I blacked out after snorting over 100mg at once about a week into using it. Then threw the rest away. 


This month, I've picked up O-PCE again and it's the same as in 2018. I have been drinking every day, not exercising, ordering lots of food via ubereats, pretty much being very lazy and unmotivated. I've decided to use it again as a tool to get back in shape and cut back on my alcohol consumption. I still snort doses of about 7mg when I wake up. Then redose 2-4 times a day on doses ranging from 3-10mg oral or insufflated. I have no desire to plug it, no desire to redose after about 7pm, far less interest in drinking, and I've started exercising again. Exercising on this drug really improves mental focus and stamina. It's great for power yoga and help you push past your limits. 


The only downside I run into is that it takes a tool on your body. I get very fatigued when I'm not on it. I know I have to catch up to myself. But it makes me very productive without getting manic or delusional the way I do on 3-MeO-PCP and others. I've gone really deep with this drug and I don't wanna abuse it anymore. I know where it leads. But if you can control your impulses and use it wisely, it's just as functional and productive as adderall, but cleaner and more euphoric. 


I'm chiming in here because I was combing this thread to see what people had to say about hangover effects, and I'll be taking a break from it in July. But I read so many posts about heroic doses, I figured I would add my experience over the years and let you guy and gals know that if you use this drug in doses under 15mg and just stay busy, you can really turn your life around. 


Use it as a tool and monitor your dose and frequency. Find a regimen that works and stick to it. Don't chase the high; let it be a catalyst to concentrate on your artistic, financial, athletic or career goals. Don't keep more than 500mg around. Don't mix it with other drugs regularly. These are the rules I've adhered to with this drug, and it levels me up every time. Try smaller doses and go about your day. It might change your life! Hope this insight help someone. All love

Sure, you are facing a sustained saturation/downregulation they day you dont take it, so pretty normal to be quite tired they days you dont take it.


I spent the pass summer similar to you, microdosing 3-meo-pce and 5-meo-mipt mostly dayly. I had a blast, I enjoyed it amssively and got super productive as well. Did not have probems to come back to normal (stop taking ) in fall/winter. I plan to do the same this summer, maybe with even less dosage and more spare (not drug) days in between. But looking as that days I mostly spent sleeping gand doing basically nothing, maybe is even better to keep microdosing to ramp up productive and fun time.


I dont think it´s advisable to do this regimen... probably is full of quirks and dangers but personally to me makes wonders. Probably only a few experienced psiconauts can do it.


I would say my dosages were even lower than yours, tho

Glad to hear it's also worked well for you! I've never gone deep with 5-meo-mipt. I could see it being productive thought. 3-meo-pce had too long of an onset for me to properly redose, and there was something about it that felt more cumbersome. The doses I take are kind of high for functionality though. I seem to have a permanent tolerance, cause I haven't done dissociatives in months but even 18mg of O-PCE was functional for me (insufflated). 5-7mg removed anything in me that wants to stop whatever I'm focused on. I'm very ADHD and can be lazy, but when I take a small dose it feels like anything us possible and I make things happen quickly. Lower doses like 1-3mg don't give me enough push, but dosing the sweet spot a few times a day for a month or two out of the year is totally transformational. 


I hope whatever regimen you choose this year works for you! Stay safe!

Wild, did not know this chem had been around for so long, recently discovered it this year as a free sample with an order of some other dissociatives. Went through the 100mg bag over a weekend, all IV'd and fell in love. I ordered 3gs but moved away from needles shortly after so have mainly been experimenting with intranasal, though may try plugging to see if that's more effective for holing. Tolerance has definitely been steadily climbing, as I can do a 15mg line and feel only mild dissociation. The real appeal for me though has been the after effects, once I've gone 30+ mgs deep. While I enjoy the increased musical appreciation from the peak effects, it's after the peak and dissociation has worn off that it truly seems like a wonder drug to me. It seems to shift over into a full psychedelic mode, where I become hyper aware of my body and its movements. My vision warps as if I'm seeing through a fish-eye lens at a completely novel and mildly alien world, and my thoughts become more cyclical and questing. Laughing attacks have been a common experience when dosing in a group, with one friend commenting that his ribs still hurt a couple days later from laughing so much the morning/day after. The after effects themselves for me usually last a full 24hrs, give or take. A friend that unintentionally snorted what I would guess to be 80-100mg was experiencing after effects for about a full week (unpleasant ones mind you, an inability to reintegrate back into reality properly, hearing the "background generators of reality" nonstop, and general bizarre discrepancies with the distances of sounds).


I plan to proceed in a more controlled manner with this substance going forward so I can have something to report with more precise dosing and effect profiles. It has been a wonderful drug for dancing, similar to the mixture of mdma and ketamine for me and I'd love to hone in on the different sweet spots I believe it possesses for the wide range of applications I have thus far encountered. The only discouraging aspect I've noticed so far has been when mixing with 1P-LSD. Paranoid thoughts seemed to fester easier, especially with the increased intensity of visuals the O-PCE helped induce. I wonder if this is due to the general mania I feel from the O-PCE. May try 1P-LSD with DCK to see if that is indeed the case (no mania from DCK as of yet, by itself at least).

a 80-100mgs line to a non tolerant user could easily kill him or produce some serious fuckups. I would easily blackout at this dosage and Im not naive to dissos at all

O-PCE has gnarly after effects, even with low doses. Do watch out.


Also, re: 1P-LSD + O-PCE, that was my experience, too. Though, it was LSD + O-PCE. The combination was much too prone to psychotic and delusional patterns of thought, and felt too stimulating for comfort.

Hey everyone I got O-PCE today and wanted to test if it could be a good study aid, in small doses of course.

I did 2.4 mg  orally and after 30 minutes I felt like I just drinked a beer or two, but  in contrast to ethanol - this felt energizing! 

However, I couldn't study becase of the drunk-like feling, but I cleaned up my apartment  like crazy. It;s good for physical work definitely. 

Very nice substance, can't wait to try normal doses.

Yea I've been playing with O-PCE again and it's quite altering of attention and focus unless the absolute smallest amount possible is taken. 3-MeO-PCP is much better for studying, etc.

I love psychedelics, I had many great experiences throughout the years. But nothing comes close to a 2 Oxo PCE and 4 HO MET combo.

It was the most euphoric, life changing experience I ever had.

I'm not sure about 20202/2021 batches, but the batch I have (from earlier) looks like small grains of rice as crystals, white/clear, very dense.


Also we can't talk about origin, really.

I'm not a big dissociative user but 2'-Oxo-PCE was my favorite arylcyclohexylamine. It's a very powerful and trippy drug which in my experience is also rather clearheaded for what it is, though not so much right when the anesthesia is first really kicking in. I preferred it to methoxetamine for feeling similar but being more psychedelic-like, less pushy in an addictively euphoric sense, and significantly longer-lasting.

Is not the best disso out there but totaly deserves to try it


For a novel disso user around 5mgs should have a good effect. Better take it in the morning or not too late as it will produce insomnia for a good 12 or more hours. Delicious insomnia where you are mentaly active enjoying inet or films, but unable to sleep if you have to work the next day

I got a free sample of this stuff with my final few orders of Etizolam before it gets banned, and I've been reading all these reports. I'm gonna go ahead and try a 1mg allergy test and then see how 5 mg goes. Sounds like it does exactly what I'm looking for, like a psychedelic coffee or something at low doses. Pretty pumped fam! I'll report back

So it's been about 2 hours and I started with ~1 mg insufflated dose waited for 5-10 minutes. Nothing going on at that point.


Did another 5 mg, walked around the block, took about 20 minutes to kind of feel it out. Still not really much going on, so I took the last bump for a total of about 11 mg at 45 mins in.


The total of 11 mg was insufflated in a total of about 45 mins. Not much happening until the 1.5 hr mark.


It really takes a long time to develop. It reminds me very distinctly of how 4-ACO-DMT takes quite a long time to actually hit. I have a lot of energy, things are very clear, I feel really good, and I can tell I have a little bit of cognitive euphoria and a little bit of mania coming on, because I feel like responding to YouTube videos in the comments section, which is something I try to abstain from because it just does no good for me.


Knowing that, I can stop myself before I start doing it. I cooked dinner, I've eaten and I'm about to go for another walk after my high protein low fat meal, and then I'm going to continue studying. I think this is a great ergogenic aid, however I feel like where it might be a little bit disadvantageous is taking it later in the day. I believe from my past experience with most dissociatives (and from reading other's experiences with this one) that this will almost certainly cause insomnia, and for that reason I'm very glad to have some etizolam on hand. Tonight is going to be a 2.5 mg night so that I can get to bed on time. The next time I touch this stuff it's going to be first thing in the morning, and I think I'm going to order more because it is quite pleasurable. I would love to grab some before the Dutch RC ban really takes hold.


I think it's advantages are the very tiny dose required to produce a very strong effect, I have yet to measure my blood pressure but that is going to be something I will do probably before my last meal of the day as to try to avoid obscuring the results by eating a large meal right before taking the blood pressure. I did take my blood pressure before dosing and it was 120 over 70 with a resting heart rate of 64 beats per minute. This is dragging on way too long, but I will report in detail at the end of the day when I'm there.


So far though, 10 out of 10. I love this s***. It delivered exactly what I was looking for, a boost in motivation and drive with minimal dissociation and a little bit of visual sparkle. Beautiful stuff.


I would imagine higher doses would be a lot more serious and way less of an ergogenic study aid.

Yeah higher doses are extremely dissociating and heavy, from what I understand from reports.  I have yet to try a higher dose of it, because people often report it as rather cold and clinical and it doesn't sound up my alley.  I have taken up to 7mg and found it quite dissociating even at that dose, personally.  I didn't feel like I could do anything useful, I just sat around and watched TV at the time.

[@Xorkoth](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/77889/), it's super nice to see you around. I'm transiently in and out of BL, getting my College on, but I still like to dabble in the dark arts here and there. Missed ya dude, I wish I had more online time to hang with my BL fam.


Checked the clock at at the 4 hr mark, the climax has definitely rolled over into the slow comedown. I went for a good long walk and listened to whatever YouTube stuff I was into, crossing the road required a little extra attention, but all in all manageable and enjoyable. I definitely feel like I'd want to keep to myself on this stuff and not be very social as to avoid embarrassing myself by being overly social and losing my filter as the euphoria sometimes does to me. I'd definitely avoid driving for the first 4 hrs, but after the peak, it's just a strange stimmy kind of ordeal. Quite nice still, I can feel everything clearly.


Getting up and moving makes the effect feel much more obvious, sort of like when on DXM. Seated, it hides, walking it wonks a little in a nice way.


Blood pressure is 112/66 RHR 66. Noice. Been working on getting that down consistently through lifestyle and diet. Nice to see that a little hedonism doesn't blast it super high or anything!

O-PCE is definitely stimulating, and has a stimulating and long tail to it, also.


I've recently decided that I do not like the nature of this chemical, as it keeps taking me to weird places - and not at high doses - just at low doses mixed with other substances. I'll likely retire this one.


Glad you're enjoying it, Working_Class

Yeah, not the most rounded disso out there. I like the mix of energy plus anestethic traits. I dont like it´s cold and void nature and the long tail.

I've gone up 25 mg with 2'-Oxo-PCE and it was one of my favorite dissociative experiences ever. It's highly psychedelic (especially for a dissociative, and somewhat in general) at that level for me, and feels somewhat comparable to an indole psychedelic specifically for me, in contrast to, for example, memantine, which also feels highly psychedelic for a dissociative for me, yet reminds me more of a phenethylamine psychedelic so far. My only real complaint is maybe perhaps in line with what [@psy997](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/250483/) was saying, which is that it's... weird. It's not the most pleasant aesthetic, although it doesn't make me feel bad in the moment.


10 mg was my favorite alcohol replacement ever. I completely disagree with the idea that 2'-Oxo-PCE is cold personally, though I feel like I could understand why people would feel that way if they were rating it as relative to something like methoxetamine and were really craving something that was more like the latter, but that wasn't my concern. For me methoxetamine has this intense, stimulating high that is somewhat comparable to oxycodone, MDMA, 4-HO-MET, or 2C-C, while 2'-Oxo-PCE is much lighter in this way, and that's one of my favorite things about it, because without all that it feels super lucid and controlled by comparison, yet it still feels like being unbelievably and euphorically drunk except with greater body comfort and lasting for much longer (plus, there's already methoxetamine for the other stuff too when it's wanted). Methoxetamine has a component that feels like being drunk on alcohol to me too, but its other effects kind of take things in a more distinct direction for me, whereas 2'-Oxo-PCE feels more completely similar to just being at the perfect level of drunkenness for me, and still just different enough in a way that still makes it a lot better than that too.


I don't have either anymore but I miss them sometimes.

Thanks for the detailed response! I've been reading your trip reports for years and they're still some of the most detailed articles online. Jems of information ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


I found it (O-PCE) to feel fairly similar to the 4 subbed tryptamines in character, albeit more intoxicating and a fair bit more stimulating. It's claimed it's spot among my favorite low dose drugs in the collection, higher doses I'm looking forward to experiencing. 


One of my next acquisitions will hopefully include 3-MEO-PCE. I've read lots about these but never given them a whirl yet. It's just about time.

I can't remember how high I've gone with it as I haven't used anything more than low doses since 2017. I did experience some pretty out there states, though. They were profound, but they were also extremely busy and chaotic, and had strong potential for getting lost, or finding oneself in unwanted places.

You're very welcome, and thank you too! I really appreciate you saying that. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) I try to make them thorough, and I have fun writing them.


Yep, that definitely agrees with my observations too. I also find methoxetamine similar to a 4-substituted tryptamine, which is why I included 4-HO-MET in that comparison above, but it is specifically similar to that more blatant or over-the-top euphoria for me like what 4-HO-MET as well as others like 4-HO-MiPT get into, whereas 2'-Oxo-PCE reminds me more of psilocybin mushrooms as well as 4-HO-DET, with the latter also being what I tend to use as a point of reference for comparing the weirdness of it. Both 2'-Oxo-PCE and 4-HO-DET are kind of creepy for me, getting into a bit more twisted of an area that is most often expected of psychedelic substances. I'd love to know what you think about the higher dosages when you try them, I think they're pretty interesting, though certainly powerful.


Good luck with the 3-MeO-PCE too! I've never taken it but I've heard a lot of good things.

That's equally true for me, but I personally find 5-HT2A receptor agonists and NMDA receptor antagonists to have a decent amount of overlap. I don't consider them interchangeable but I can easily compare and contrast them.

Last night I smoked 8 mg O-PCE which provided a little rush and comfortable dissociation. I am not all that great with the meth pipe yet though so this round was pretty inefficient. I followed it up with 14mg smoked an hour later and this was the sweet spot. I sunk into my chair and dissolved out into the world while listening to Mogwai. No sense of unity or wholeness, just pure obliteration. The hole lasted maybe 10-12 minutes before giving way to a gentler dissociation. Unfortunately, I decided to push it and smoked 22mg another hour later. While the hole was exquisite, the next two hours just felt like I was brain-damaged. Not all that fun of a time and reminded me of other times snorting high dosages of O-PCE. I think that medium dose was perfect and in the future will stick to a single 14-15mg dose.

why is it that O-PCE is one of the main dissos that people can instantly tell we are on?


like I can sometimes sneak some 3-HO-PCP by my significant other, but if i mix in even a speck of OPCE she instantly knows.


is there anyway to hide this?

It's because it's really strong and dissociating.  It makes you intoxicated, speech is changed, movement is changed.  So no, it's gonna be obvious.

Can anybody give a comparison of dck and o-pce? I suspect dck to be more rougher. Is that the case? I only have experience with dck.

My experience has been that O-PCE is rougher than DCK, and colder.  DCK is very intoxicating and sedating but it feels softer and more comfortable to me.

They both feel more stupefying than other dissociatives I've tried, but DCK is quite warm and sometimes quite euphoric. O-PCE reminded me a lot of high dose 3-MeO-PCP. Cold, clinical, and very dissociating, but without much content.


I've never enjoyed O-PCE the handful of times I tried it. I've had some good experiences with DCK, but it's hit or miss.

Ok I’ll stick to dck then, it’s a really useful dissociative. Good on it’s own but also no problems with combining it with other substances.

O-PCE is an open eyes hole. What a trip. What a fucking weird drug, considering its so chemically close to other aryls. Lower dosage make me feel like an android, while higher dosages it's always "bad" mind-bending trip which tells me to get out of this limbo and hole i've been stuck in life. I wish i could carry-over some of these sensations / feelings into the sobriety so i can actually make a change in my life.


Edit: to the person that wanted a comparison to DCK. It seems O-PCE is pretty much the same nasally or orally. While oral or nasal DCK is quite different to me. I always take it orally in order to hole. It's like an ambrosia which takes you to beautiful places.

I would like to make a correction. On saturday i took a big dose (30mg) intranasally, a step up from 25mg dose described in previous post, but 5mg isn't THAT much. I don't know what was the reason for high being different, other than fact i took 1cp-LSD the day before and there was a death of a family member involved. Either way i doubt how these 2 variables could affect the high to become a lot more closed eyes-holey, dreamy and a bit of CEV. It became a lot more similar to DCK, altho still distinct in it's own way. I also felt somekind of feminine (?drug?) presence which i do on DCK but i don't think it was the same one.

i had a strange ach sold as o-pce from the netherlands. it felt like an phenyl but somewhat like glue in the brain, a bit like the aminoalkylindoles but it was a dissociative. i suppose it wasnt an keton rather an oxime.

Well....I made the infernal leap and tried an IM shot of 30mg last night and barely felt anything after zn hour.....so I plugged 30 more and bam worked like magic....very strange how different ROA's affect this class of drugs....rectal administration is SOOOOO much stronger and euphoric than any other.....no idea why???

I'm beginning to second guess myself and wonder if I put the wheel filter on backwards???

It looked like it should obviously go on one way but I was reading that wheel filters typically are meant for particles to move through it one way and not the other?

And I was very careful about how and where I made the injection exactly in the correct spot in the shoulder according to the diagram I downloaded....I do remember thinking godamn this needle seems longer than it should have to be but it was purchased from a medical supply store as a IM needle tip and I definitely slowly and carefully inserted it all.the way and very slowly plunged....it definitely gave me an alert but very little of that o-pce magic.

The rectal dose put straight into the hole....I actually HATE needles so that experiment won't be repeated especially with o-pce....it feels like a completely different drug depending on ROA.

Rectal is just absolutely next level and if you only do 1 single large dose and don't redose there is no crazy long lasting tail end ....you actually sober up pretty quickly .

However   if you take even 1 redose after your initial hole, I've noticed strong lingering effects into the next day.

But 1 huge hole dose seems to rival any experience I've had on MXE...it's just thst the o-pce hole is very short like 30mins and you come out of it and start to rapidly return to baseline.

In this sense to me it's like the dmt of dissos....you take one massive dose, immediately are in o-pce land for half an hour then shot back to reality....I also don't find it terribly amnesiac unless I redose.

I can remember my holing experience on o-pce with great detail.

I feel like this doesn't get a lot of love because people are just not using the right way and for the wrong reasons... every other ROA has been pretty MEH....

And if you have plans to do anything other lay in bed and holing to crazy music then this I don't think is the disso for anyone who wants to do anything beyond that.

It's been quite a few years since my O-PCE trip, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. It was much colder and rational compared to MXE, and to be 100% honest, it was more visual than LSD. I did find it to be rather long lasting and manic on the comedown but I would def try it again.


For whatever reason, my interest in arylcyclohexamines has grown stronger over the years. Possibly because of the time I holed on MXIpr and lived in a torus field for like 10000 years.

For a dissociative, I find 2'-Oxo-PCE to seem notably similar to psilocin in its psychedelic qualities. Very visual although sometimes in weirder ways than psychedelics do.


I really enjoy 2'-Oxo-PCE. I take it late at night and stay up lost in the wonkiness until I get too tired and then wake up still feeling nice and loose the next day.

Have you tried plugging it yet???

It's like a completely different drug snorted vs rectal.admin.

Boofing it in a mil or 2 of distilled water (its CRAZY water soluble)

Will hit you like a freight train and have you holing strongly within 10mins....the hole this way only lasts about 30-45 mins but it's the most psychedelic disso I've ever experienced.....my holing experiences on o-pce have rivaled my strongest DMT trips by a large margin.

40mg is my standard holing dose....depending on your tolorance it will put you in the hole at that dose unless yiu have massive tolorance to dissos.

Just in case you DONT want to hole (which I think is what I aim for in every o-pce session) but be wary...40mg rectally is a POWERFUL dose for most.

Dont know but with dck i go up to 45mg and dont really hole. Also 3meo-pcp, Standart Dose is around 25mg and then i redose 2 times. No tolerance, its always this way. Dxm is more normal, I think 570mg was my highest.

was on a bit of a reckless binge with this stuff went through 250 mg daily often in 30 or 40 mg doses insufflated. I noticed I would hack up this blue covered fluid and now have the same color present in two lines like a thread across my pointer finger. no clue whether this is a cut or impurity or what. but I think its safe to say im staying away from any PCP and MXE analogues for a long time, just stick to to good old ketamine

I have given up searching the thread as I can’t find the info I want. Is oral an ok ROA for this monkey? I don’t want to sniff because I want to be able to dilute with water to dose more precisely, and would prefer leaving my bum out of the drug game, as it hasn’t done harm to anyone so I dont want to do harm to it…

##### O-PCE

2'-Oxo-PCE (also known as as Eticyclidone, and O-PCE) is a lesser-known novel dissociative substance of the arylcyclohexylamine class that produces dissociative, anesthetic, stimulating and hallucinogenic effects when administered.  It is structurally related to arylcyclohexylamines like MXE...

I wouldn't go higher than 5mgs if you are not a disso head. That´s a quite potent one. 3mg if you are not very into dissos, maybe redose 2mgs later if you feel like

Definitely but my question is about ROA. I always start on the light side of dosage, and I have a cheap mg scale so I prefer diluting at least 50  at a time to dose more precisely

Oral is perfect with this one. Or sublingual. I never tried to snort it but should work too. Sniffing dissos us to work less optimal than oral normally, except K, you get higher quality/magic effects via oral or sublingual

Yes, oral is a gret ROA for this one.  In fact, many people, myself included, find it both more potent, and qualitatively deeper and "better" when I eat it, vs snorting it.

I have finally got my hands on some of this for the first time  & I am deep in the midst of my first foray into the field with it. It would be a little premature to try to evaluate it just yet but I think I am going to be very fond of this one.

I found o-pce to be the most visual of ACHs, maybe not so much OEVs, but the CEVs were on par with or stronger than 200ug of LSD.


Would probably try again but I also had strong mania on the tail end

I finally have some of this on its way. I've been wanting to try it for years and am very excited that I now will get the chance. What's a good starting dose for oral? I am very experienced with dissociatives and have a bit of a tolerance from years of abuse. Was thinking of starting with 15mg oral with no redose to see how it effects me, but I figured I'd ask

Just snorted 12mg of O-PCE. My first foray into this chemical. I have good hopes for this chemical as I'm a huge fan of dissociatives and I love the manic push that they provide me. Recently they've enabled me to make some positive changes in my life while under their influence. We'll see how it goes! I do have a perma-tolerance and have been on a bit of a bender this past week, so I don't think that 12mg insufflated will be too much to handle

I finally found o-pce. I’m pretty sure I haven’t tried it, but 6 years ago I think I had a little sample that I snorted when I was on Al-lad. It was one of the best trips I had. I remembered it was particularly potent.


I’ve heard that some people vape this compound. Is it a viable roa? I only nabbed 250mg and have a tolerance to dissos, so I wonder how much I’ll need. Ill prolly plug it if not IM or IV it.

Works quite well vaped, strong rush. Quite potent, 10mg had me falling through the couch without tolerance. Start with 20mg vaped if you have a big tolerance? Easy to add more...

Yeah I purchased a small amount as I have a few grams of fxe coming in. I wonder how combing those 2 in low doses would be like? 


Is O-PcE really that stimulating? Psychowiki describes it as one of the more stimulating dissos and lacks warmth and is rather clinical in its effects. Is that an accurate characterization?

I would say that is an accurate description. If you've tried other dissociatives, you'll understand what people mean by coldness, although it's not always there, not necessarily unpleasant, and definitely dose-dependent. Residual stimulation can be a bit much at higher doses, so you might want to make sure you have nothing too important to do the next day. You may also experience an increased heart rate. No idea about how it combines with other dissos.

To me it felt like the essence of "holing" but little else. Extremely dissociating but without any of the extra effects that I enjoy. Very cold and clinical, I could see vaping some while using FXE being a nice experience. 


I did not find it stimulating, I just laid around when I tried it.

So do you actually enjoy this substance? Lol

Glad I ordered a small amount. Been investing in fxe more than anything. Does o-pce mix well with other compounds? I know cannabis increases the effects of all dissos, but I can’t handle weed on its own. I’ve flown off the handle a few times from that combo. Perhaps a small dose in conjunction with lsd would be nice.

I only had it once, it wasn't a great time to be honest. Some people absolutely love it. I'll certainly use it again, the rush of vaping is pretty incredible. I am not sure how I would combine it with psychedelics...

Combined with 2C-B-FLY and 2C-B was one of the best days of my life hands down. This was my dosing regimen, ir worked well.


25mgs O-PCE

20mgs 2C-B-FLY


Tripped hard super euphoric, took dissos nasally and the orally. Did not hole tho, feel like sniffing it isnt the best method. When you eat the stuff it easily feels twice as potent. Id never sniff it again if i had HCL.


5hrs later.


25mgs O-PCE

25mgs 2C-B


Both taken orally at the same time, about 30-40mins later i fall right into one of the most powerful holes i ever been in. Beautiful beyond words and it felt like it lasted a lifetime. Once i came out of it the visuals were insane and it was so pleasurable. Seriously one of my best drug experiences and ive had a few.

I’m fairly certain I tried opce like 7 years ago as a sample sent with my Al-lad. I snorted some right when my 450 mic peak was starting to fade and damn, it really launched me into a new realm, one filled with ineffable beauty. It was a while ago so recalling the details are hard, but I remember when it began to kick in. I was out in my porch smoking a joint and the branches of various trees started to envelope me and I became connected with everything. The psychedelic landscapes were changing so rapidly and I was  left in a state of pure awe. Shit got lil weird too, but it was still amazing.

it seems that many don’t like this compound, while others love it. Haven’t seen many reports using it IM/IV though. I got a bunch of micron filters, sterile glass vials, and everything necessary to make a solution. Just made one with a g of fxe.


Really interested in how different the experience is if vaped instead of consumed orally or intranasally


I have some lsd and dmt as well, so I have some research to conduct.

Dude I know. I’ve been scouring the globe searching for this compound which is particularly difficult to procure in the US. I only got to vape a small amount and I just got lil taste of its effects. Thing is this guy sent it in a 1.5 mg microtubule, so not exactly the best receptacle for such a substance, but then again I was quite obliterated from fxe when I tried to weigh some of it out. Thankfully this source came back around and I have 500mg on the way.

People say this substance has a long tail. When I take a large shot of fxe I can feel it’s after effects or glow for most of the day. It leaves in a great mood and seems to help with productivity. I’m wondering if o-pce has the same properties.

Thinking of grabbing half a g. The first batch I tried was poorly synthed or was in freebase form. The dosages I tried should have had exerted some strong effects but didn’t get anything really.


Or get 3-meo-pcp or 3-ho-pcp hmm…

Well ended up getting g of 3-ho-pcp and glad I did. Love this lil guy. Now just placed order for half a g of o-pce. This source is verified so I’m sure his o-pce won’t be a dud this time. He also had lsd and Al-lad as well as 750mg somas. Was sure to swoop some of those lovely compounds too. Got some awesome substances coming this next week. Had a gram of 2c-b hcl, 0.5g of 4-ho-met freebase, and 2 g of 5-mapb shipped yesterday.

It is true....is it legal? Depends who you ask, the loophole being argued has never been tested in court. You wouldn't believe what else is popping up on the clearnet up here, some vendors are really pushing it.

You may want to grab the 3-meo-pcp while it's still available. Even if you don't like it at first, that might change years down the road. A gram could last you a lifetime. It's literally the favorite substance next to MXE for many of us. I'm assuming you don't know about it because you ended up grabbing the 3-ho lol. 

Anyways, 3-meo-pcp is more stimulating than regular PCP. It's harder to achieve a hole, though I have holed on it and 3-ho-pcp(I don't recommend holing on either even one single time, it's not the reset that ketamine is).

I am telling you this because I can't find 3-meo-pcp that ships my way. I am certain it's on it's way into retirement and only available from a few EU countries. It's no longer available from China or NL. Perhaps I'm completely out of the loop, but I've been trying to stay up to date on the current state of 3-meo-pcp for a few months now and I'm afraid I may have to find that manic dopaminergic drive from my brothers up north who only carry opce & fxe.

I’m actually in the small minority that enjoys 3-ho-pcp more. I like that it’s a bit more mellow, warmer, and shorter acting. Also, I find that it combines better with stimulants and psychs

I meant to tell you that 3-meo-pcp is extremely difficult to source right now, it might be the last chance you get to own some. I love the stuff dearly, but I'll have to settle for 3-me, 3-ho, and maybe even o-pce

May I ask you, is o-pce the type of drug to a ruin a life? There are people saying they were unable to speak properly for days after holing. I'm experienced with dissos, but some anecdotes are scary lol. I want my dissos to enhance my life, no fuck it up on accident.

Have you consumed a very large amount in a 24hr period? Is it safe? I mean, I wouldn't be scared if I had a friend who I found out had just done 500mg+ of DCK via IV/IM, but a few opce anecdotes speak for themselves. I was never afraid of 3-ho-pcp binges and redosing, though lol.

btw get this, I seem to have a biological mechanism in my veins that makes them collapse immediately after starting to IV anything at any dose, including highly diluted ultra tiny doses.

How do you feel about it now?

I am hoping it's all just the same lol

You are absolutely playing a role in my decision to obtain this over any other available arylcylco

Did you know it's an analogue of Tiletamine?

Do you love DCK? I loved dck holes, but I suppose it never had too much hypomania. It was very unfunctional of course.

Well now I'm extremely overly excited about the fact that even though 3-meo-pcp isn't available, I can (likely) create healthy hypo-mania and an improvement in quality of life similar to that brought about by Mushrooms via O-PCE.

I have a feeling 3-**me**-pcp(not 3meo) is going to be heavy, heavy on the sigma receptor(if that means anything) and much riskier for becoming WET AF(riskier type of mania) for the next few weeks ***after cessation

"I did some stupid shit on this drugs, which I mostly don't remember but the ting i remember is that it kept getting crazier and crazier every day. I mean like really nasty stuff. I mean I almost cut my penis, almost. I heard voices. I almost when to my neighbors house to burglar them, got into fights, saw spirits in my basement, broke into a store. Anyway, to be honest it's difficult to say if all this shit was dream or reality but I got arrested once in the last 10 days and have lots of bruises and scars. Needless to say I threw this 5g bag away and quit that shit. "*

3-x-pcp compounds have never disrupted my life in a negative manner. I have insane tolerance to dissos so, 15mg of insufflated  3-ho-pcp with 1-2 10mg redoses a day enables me to be perfectly functional and alleviates depressive and anxiety.


 I had to actually dump approx 800-850mg of 3-ho-pcp Thursday night as I crashed my girls car into someone’s front gate in order to avoid hitting deer. They charged me with a  DUI but I wasn’t actually under the influence at the time, I just failed the field sobriety test due to a spranged ankle. I’m a lil worried about the blood tests and what will show, but the cops were so inept it’s almost laughable. They failed to read me Miranda rights and I had 7 tabs of 25b-nboh, 10 g of pregabalin, and like 600mg of nitrazolam in my wallet. I thought they most definitely documented those items, but when they released me and gave me my belongings, everything was in the ziplock bag. 


Dissos are one of my fav class of drugs and I’ve had serious issues with iv/im ketamine, mxe, and fxe that began to lead to some serious consequences. I don’t have too much experience with o-pce, but seeing how it’s more like the aforementioned substances, I can see the potential for disaster. 3-x-pcp vs other dissos are completely different imo. I can’t sit around and hole out via IV/IM with 3-ho-pcp, at least not in a manner like ket or fxe.

Ahhh man that is unfortunate, fortunate, and wild! Glad you got out as you did!

I actually have holed on 3-ho and 3-meo-pcp and 3-meo-pce(and others).

I love being able to plow through a bunch k or dck IM/IV, but all those others are absolutely not for holing on, though I did it way too often as a pretty depressed person abusing benzos or being lost in life.

Yeah I find high doses of 3-x-pcp compounds highly unpleasant when doses in high ranges. Gives me crazy anxiety and other negative side effects which incentivizes me to keep the doses low.  Conversely ket, mxe, fxe, etc. are great when dosed high enough to hole, which make them even more addicting. I was dosing 3-ho-pcp daily for past month and when I threw it out Thursday I really haven’t had much cravings since. When I was getting fxe all the time things began to spin out of control. Would have blackouts or go catatonic and injure myself.

I'm certain I read that plugged is great... but now I'm thinking maybe that's o-pce, ugh... Well if anything, I believe oral and sublingual are great and if you can shift your dopaminergic IV/IM injection & rush receptors into remission, you'll feel the better dopamine high of accomplishing goals and riding out any injection cravings.

I often get the dopamine itch, or whatever it is that the delta fos b gene expression does to consciousness, from anything; even tryptamines with body loads and side effects lol.

Any update you can provide? Last I checked the MXE big and dandy it hadn't been updated.

Have you tried subcutaneous? It's definitely different, slow***er*** and long, but fully bioavailable.

lmfao it also took me like ya know awhile to find the final MXE bnd [https://bluelight.org/xf/threads/th...-south-kansas-is-going-bye-bye.768572/page-43](https://bluelight.org/xf/threads/the-big-dandy-methoxetamine-mxe-thread-part-17-south-kansas-is-going-bye-bye.768572/page-43)

How is IM compared to Nasal and Oral? 

Does anybody know about the current batches floating around? 

Supposedly some are white and MadeInTheEU. I try to imagine that everyone who said this compound isn't great had a bad batch because some people are writing about this compound like it's as impressive as DMT, MXE, 3-MeO-PCP, etc.

I've read ~95% of the comments in this thread lol

Unless you're a disso veteran desperate for a religious experience, oral will do the trick.


I haven't taken any for years, but was notified that there's a package waiting for me. Will know more about current batches available in Europe soon. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Been experimenting with this form of O-PCE recently and found it to be excellent, and potent! I usually insufflate my disso and this stuff hits very nicely. 20mg is a nice spot for a medium-heavy experience with a good tolerance. Got some more on the way as I type this.

O-PCE small (live) report: about 30mg. Insufflated.


I’m usually not much into writing trip reports, but I’m currently still fully in the experience, writing is difficult. I feel like I need to capture this.


Time is weird right now…


It’s my first time trying this, I had it laying around for a good while.


I thought about trying it occasionally, and after I got home from work early, I decided to finally give it a go. Impulsively, but responsibly impulsive.


I read up on it, a lot, many times, but I didn’t expect this…


I have a lot of experience with psychedelics, but not with dissociatives.


I expected to be mildly stimulated, and chilled out, but I did read about the manic characteristics of it.


I guess I understand now.

Boy, this is a weird one for me.


It’s definitely psychedelic.


I started with around 16mg, insufflated.


Got a light buzz, waited 20 (??) minutes, and I doubled it up, and took a shower.


I knew this is a quite heavy dose. Still caught me off guard.


It turned into some deep dreamy psychedelic trip to memory lane, quickly.


I don’t know how long I was in the shower, but my entire youth, where it (I) went wrong, the bad friends I hung out with, the teen angst, growing up, (that was a long time ago), the things I did, choices I made, … my whole life trajectory from about twelve year old me, to 40 year old me played off in my mind like an interactive movie…


Guilt/remorse/shame… relief(?)


I could, and probably still can I guess, I’m still fully in there, grab a thought, and be zapped to that place in time instantly…


I usually don’t really go to those long past times/memories anymore, but now I was just pushed out there, to relive it.


Makes me feel like I need to make better choices.

It’s so utterly weird. Very interesting though…. Very.


The weirdest part is that I feel like I never want to touch drugs in my life anymore, with the absolutely contradictory feeling that I want (need) to do this much more often.


I think that means I better be very careful with this one, I feel like it’s easy to get dragged out on a path I don’t necessarily want to go. I have an addictive personality, and for sure a messed up dopamine system to begin with. So, it’s wise for me to keep this stored away for a good while.


I do think it has a lot of potential in a therapeutic setting.


Very interesting first encounter with O-PCE


EDIT:

The double feeling of wanting to do it more, and never again is new for me, very confusing.

Yeah, be careful, give it time or at least limit yourself very much with use otherwise as you have addictive personality the bad will out-weight the good. It (almost?) always does with sweet NMDA antagonists no matter what some of us try to believe.

Not at all! I didn't even add any lidocaine.


Using this stuff intranasally opened me up to a whole new world of pain.


I guess my technique was very clean. Used 1.5ml along with around 15mg 2-Oxo-PCE.


Redosed 2-Oxo-PCE twice rectally, 15mg each.


I've IV'ed quite a few substances - and combined them via other routes. IV 2C-P was a first time for me, but I've IV'ed 2C-E+2-Oxo-PCE dozens of times.** It's hands down the best drug combination I have ever tried**.


It can be enhanced further by sprinkling in some MDMA, but it really isn't necessary. I could've done that since I had some at home by chance, but at some point the euphoria just gets to a ridiculous level and I'm more after the psychedelic aspects.


EDIT: It doesn't work with 2C-B. That's just a completely different ride. 2-Oxo-PCE and 2C-E/P is where it's at. It's like injecting god.

I’m sure it is but it *might* be one of more dangerous too.


Interesting how you say 2c-b doesn’t work. I had a lot of luck with 2c-b in many combos, with K, MDMA, nitrous, LSD, DOC and some others too.

Did you get anything useful out of this 2c-p dose along with the o-pce? I had 2c-p once at 5mg with some weed and I could only describe it as a torture psychedelic…

I never tried a serious dose of 2c-p (my most intense non-combo 2c-x experience was probably with around 35mg of 2c-e) but body load wasn’t bad and it felt closer to a bit more relaxing 2c-i with a really long duration than rest 2c-x I tried. Didn’t got that – “it’s an LSD of 2c-xs” experience but can imagine trip can get deep and really mental at high doses. Obviously can become a torture too.


I think some of the compounds of 2c-x family produce diverse responses, even much more so than DOx relatives and for just about any but 2c-b (which wast majority of people love) seems to have people really loving them, finding mediocre or even totally bad experience. Even 2c-i and 2c-e that are still mostly loved by psychedelic lovers have fans and those really not liking them. I really liked 2c-e but not so much 2c-i. I found 2c-t-x and 2c-c much better and 2c-p about on par with it.


Going further to stuff like 2c-b-bk some find it on par with 2c-b, some find it significantly less shiny and nice (I’m in that group) while some find it totally shit. I guess with that one it’s cuz it gets metabolized to another active compound.

2C-B and ketamine are okay together, but it's more of a hyped up state to me than strong psychedelia. More of a rollercoaster ride type of fun, but unlikely to ever result in a religious experience. Huge fan of 2C-E, which would be my favourite synthetic phenylethylamine along with 2C-P. I've done plenty of DOx and they aren't where it's at for me. Especially in combination with 2-Oxo-PCE, 2C-E and 2C-P are just perfect. I've combined so many dissociatives with psychedelics and some of these combinations are just awful. 5-MeO-MiPT and ketamine even made me puke, but I kept shooting up more, feet in a puddle of vomit, completely spaced out. Absolutely disgraceful. No magic there. It really took me many years to figure out my go-to combination, along with the whole dosing schedule. The 2C-E/2-Oxo-PCE shot just works every time. Easily 10 hours of the most intense disso/psychedelic state I can be in without giving me amnesia when redosing the 2-Oxo-PCE rectally. It took more than a day for my motor skills to return to almost baseline though and another 2 days until my thinking was not impaired anymore. Never observed it this badly with 2C-E before, but maybe the 2-Oxo-PCE was a bit cleaner or my tolerance is just down since I last used it a few years back.

Wow really? I remember taking at intranasally at 10mg (~20mg oral) the first time and as the horrible pain this caused was beginning to grow weaker after 15 minutes I was already melting away. I probably cried for 18 hours straight. That trip stayed with me for many months.


I've had a lot of different psychedelics, but never wanted to try the 2C-P I had lying around after what I had read about it. I only ever took it because my options were limited, but it impressed the shit out of me.

2c-e was my second psychedelic (after LSD and MG even before but that doesn’t really count) and I had many great experiences on it.


I loved 2c-b and K together but not that much more than each alone. But LSD, 2c-b and K were really great combo for me, much more than same without LSD.


One of best and most memorable combos of psychedelic and disso for me was a healthy dose of LSD (not sure how much exactly as it was a long ago but probably round 250mics) and ether. As I huffed ether very soon I found myself laying on the bed and transforming into intertwined endless strings, like electric fabric made stretching from one side of infinity to other and dissolving into those. Could try to describe it better but I don’t think it’s really possible. It was a sort of very slow and very fast onset of ego death revolved in a very spectacular way. I also remember gaining self back and having experience that again loses, fabric so to speak, when put into words even if words or communication of sort was involved.


God I miss it all.

That are some massive doses of 2c-p consumed. I am generally not the biggest fan of 4-alkyl 2cs with 2c-e having its right to exist as a full on psychedelic. 2c-d I had no proper dose but it felt nice and, as said, 2c-p being pure Horror.

I'd say 10mg intranasal is a good dose for someone who has done 2C-E at over 7mg via the same route, but I hear some people react very badly to 2C-P. Sorry to hear you had a bad time.

I actually had this stuff lying around for 10 years before I took it. Bought it for a few Euros back then in the clearnet. There was only one friend (professional trumpet player) who regularly asked me for a dose, nobody else had ever taken it. He would take far north of 20mg (I don't remember, but much more than any sane person without tolerance should ever take), go to some bar, pick up a woman and just fuck all night long. I am aware this is not the typical reaction though. That guy was really weird when it came to psychedelics and dissociatives. And sex I suppose.

I'm actually about to get 500ish mg of 2cp in a trade, do you have any recommendations of what I should do while I'm on it? (other than going to bars and fucking), because I'm a little worried about the duration of it.Also originally wanted to say that I tried vaped opce for the first time today and it feels very very similar to a slightly more intense ket for me

Ohhh my is O-PCE good to mix, but ive only done it with 2C-B and 2C-B-FLY at this point cuz i had a limited amount of material back then. I have alot now tho i just got two grams of O-PCE hcl yesterday and i have a gram of the freebase also. 


Plan on doing a bunch of combos like with BOD, 4-AcO-DMT, LSD, Psilocybin, FXE, n2O, DMT, 4-HO-MET and probably other stuff too. Obviously not all at once just pairing one other compound at the same time. Will probably drop 20mgs orally with 200ugs of LSD for the first go around, after i test it by itself. 


Mixing psychs and dissos is my favorite way to trip, its a guaranteed breakthru everytime pretty much. Especially like mixing 2C-B with dissos it turns me into a state of euphoric bliss and the trip is always very magical, Psilacetin takes you about as far out there as you can go. 


Had some of the most powerful psychedelic states of my life mixing it with 3-MeO-PCP. When i did LSD and FXE a couple weeks ago that was wild also, 300ugs acid with 250mgs FXE intranasal. Was the hardest ive tripped in years. The hole during that was mindblowing. It lasted forever tho, like 24hrs roughly.

damnn, I found that o pce had strong sert action when combined, turning 3mmc into a highly seratogenic and rolly experience making it feel like mdma light. With the advantage being having an afterglow, and being able to go to bed an hour or two after my final dose.

very very euphoric, very empathogenic and social, and friendly but none of the couchlocky mindfuck that mdma or mda might have

Hi tryptamight, nice to find you here also.


Just leaving my 2cents here.  Be careful with OPCE, seems pretty great in the beginning but gets fucking addictive and tolerance goes up fast. It's dangerous.


Keep safe.

Maybe try to connect with people from other places, other situations, other times? Do some reading before. Pick some music that fits the theme. Get lost in emotion.


For example, the Inuit and the sufferings they've had to endure under the Brits. Music would be Willie Thrasher.


Definitely try to connect to other places, cultures and times. Pure magic.

^^^


i totally do this on dissos, especially the 'hole'ier ones like o-pce. 


they really allow me to conceptualize and internalize the experiences of others. really mentally wear their shoes.


i also love nature documentaries on them, especially ones that emphasize biome destruction and other horrible things we do to other animal, our brethren. 


also, brian eno's 'music for airports' slowed down is purrrrrrfect for near- holes.

Alright i decided to order a g of opce. haven't done it in like 8 years so can't recall much other than its quite potent. my last run with 3-meo-pce was unfortunately underwhelming. Went through a whole g and just couldn't find the magic. Last time i got o-pce a few months back, the vendor admitted it was a bad synth after he tested it. i'd try to vape it and all i'd get was some minor dissociation and a few other times i lost control of my motor skills and fell over. 


Anyways, I got a g coming from a trusted source that's been tested. quite pricey, but the potency sort of makes up for it. i have an insurmountable dissos tolerance and plan on trying to IV some. i briefly read through the thread and saw IV use was mentioned a couple times. What's a good dosage for me to start at. I was thinking 10mg. Not  quite sure what the bioavailabilities are for this compound. I'd rather go IV or vape in order to avoid the long lasting residual effects.

Dang, I haven’t IV’d opce since 2017 but I remember 10mg being more than enough back then, could be another bad synth?


I would not recommend IVing 40mg

Okay so I'm fairly certain my source provides pure o-pce. They look like little small white crystals. Now I see a lot of folks saying if 40mg doesn't destroy u it's bad material. I ate 38mg and had a mild experience, but I do have a massive tolerance. i'll try plugging 40mg later

40mg would have me in the psych ward! I believe the best roa for O-PCE is vaped, provides a nitrous like onset and a reduced duration. I have seen it referred to as "disso crack", be careful. 


Wasn't my cup of tea but many rank it as their favourite.

So the first reference on the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2-Oxo-PCE) says this is schedule 1 in Canada, but it links to a [section that was repealed](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/c-38.8/page-13.html#h-95315), and if you go the the [previous version](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/c-38.8/section-sched95819-20220831.html) of the page I don't even think it ever applied to O-PCE in the first place (Claude 3 agrees, though I'm no chemistry expert).


If there's anyone here that edits Wikipedia articles this might be a good one to look at. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Does anybody know if O-PCE vaped still provides an afterglow? Which ROA is known to provide the longest lasting afterglow/does anybody have any general thoughts on the topic of OPCE's antidepressant effect?

Hey y'all


I just checked my blood results for an unrelated issue after maybe 10 days of O-pce binging. 600mg

 First time

 Never had any negative effects from a dissosciative substance but my Eonisiphil count has been eradicated as per a blood test fhat was taken recently

 I think my last trip was 36 hours before the blood draw

 You can see previous draws there with normal counts.


I have another blood test scheduled for the 15th but missed a call from my nurse


Can anyone tell me the outcomes other people have experienced with this issue? I could have sworn seeing a post or two like that years ago but it seemed isolated, I convinced myself that it was a leaser risk thsn it was apparently


Did people stop doing the drug and recover, or did these people need hospital stays for this?


Edit/Update: my docs just say to stop all extra/supplements drugs and to come get new tests in a month. Alcohol also lowers this type of blood cell marker, so my experience doesnt prove anti-biotic action. It shows its not healthy, though.

I'm going to veer off to talk about MXIpr but i want to say that O-PCE was truly extremely visual for me, more so than any other arylcyclohexylamine, it was on par with a strong LSD trip. I remember lying in bed very calm but seeing 3d rainbow dreiduls rotating in perfect clarity. When I came out of it (quite manic) I was pretty set on scuba diving the Nile delta area in Egypt. That sadly hasn't happened yet.

I'll try and pull up the TR, but it was insane coming back. the toroid turned into colors, and the lines became like waves and then i heard the ocean and i was watching the ocean, and then I remembered the word/name "Ally" (the girl I was in love with), before I even remembered my own name.

So I dont use dissos frequently, but a few days ago I had one the most  psychedelic experience of my life.


I'd been doing small lines of 2FDCK over a few hrs, prolly 150mg or so and I walked my friend home. When I got back I felt like I could handle a little bit more, so I pulled out a 50mg sample of MXipr and insufflated it. I may have taken a toke of dmt, when I came to it had been moved.


Anyway I had a complete OBE spiritual experience. I'm honestly still a bit in shock and just exhausted but it's been about 36 hrs. Umm in a nutshell, I basically became aware that I was a single point of conciousness In the center of a massive toroid structure. Withikely trillions of colored lines that were constantly moving. I spent easily 10,000 years in a state of complete nirvana before remembering my original existence and as soon as I had a memory of it, I started to slide down one of the millions of colored lines of the toroid. As I moved I watched all the other lines moving in a different way and they started turning into these waveforms and then into water. Which I realized was the ocean. I could hear it as well. Then I remembered someone I love, and then I remembered who I was, and that I can control my body with my mind so I opened my eyes to find myself in my little house 1000s of miles away. I've never had such an experience and I've had several breakthrough experiences with 5 meo dmt."

But seriously though.


To me it sounds like you passed through non-duality. Maybe.


Well, maybe not maybe. But either yes-no or no-yes. Maybe.


Sometimes it’s difficult to tell the difference between order and chaos. But if it feels like order, it’s probably chaos, and if it feels like chaos, it’s probably order.


As far as I can tell, anyway. ![🧙‍♀️](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f9d9-2640.png)


(Maybe.)


They say time flies when you’re having fun. But you have to be careful. If you have too much fun, you may end up doing everything everywhere all at once. You can come out of the other side of infinity perfectly sane if you remember zero of it. But don’t let that make you think the voices in your head won’t remember.


I find that seeking boredom can feel like a meaningful remedy to having had too much fun. But you have to be careful. If you find too much boredom, you may end up stuck doing nothing nowhere forever. You can come out the other side of zero completely insane if you remember infinity for it. And once you remember that, it might be pretty hard to forget.


I might not be the best guide though. Sometimes it’s hard for me to tell the difference between sanity and insanity.


Incidentally, I recommend smoking salvia.

Just received a gram of O-PCE. This time it seems to be legit. The crystal formations are distinct and clean. I had 35mg of 2-fma about 6 hours ago. I used to mix stims and dissos before, but was always on benzos and i haven’t tried actual o-pce. I’ve heard it’s more stimulating than others, is this true? Planning on vaping it.

Finally, this batch is the real deal. Just tried vaping some and I enjoyed it more than I anticipated. Took me back to those manic nights I longed for. Interesting substance. 


Subsequent hits sort of pile on top of each other. Comes on in about 15 second upon exhale.

Our first experimentation with O-PCE went nicely. It was from a popular NL shop & came as big rocks of crystalline white.


(We had propably no or just a very light disso tolerance & a good amount of experience with ketamine, a lot with N2O, some with the MXE substitues & I took 3-HO-PCE, Deschliroket, DXM, MXE & MXP a few times some years ago)


After an allergy test we snorted 3mg & went for a walk. It already had a light effect. The colors seemed a bit brighter, my sense of smelling increased & everything was a bit more absurd & funny.

Slight sedation / exhaustion.


We redosed with ~4,5mg IN 1:40h later & another 6mg an hour later.

Watching a ghibli movie was magic, we got immersed into it & were emotionally opened.

N2O was fun.


The peak stayed for about 3-4h after the last dose, then a gradual decline.


The lower doses are fun.

It wasn't very stimulating or manic, pretty chill. Nice for cuddling & watching a movie or listening to music.
