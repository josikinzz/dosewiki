## SYNTHESIS
To 10 mL of a stirred solution of LAH (1 M in THF under N2), there was added dropwise a solution of 0.57 4-acetoxyindol-3-yl-N-ethyl-N-methylglyoxylamide in 10 mL anhydrous THF. When the addition was complete, the reaction mixture was brought to a reflux for 15 min. After cooling to 40 Â°C, sufficient water was added to decompose both the reaction complex and the excess hydride. After filtration through Celite (under an N2 atmosphere), the solvent was removed under vacuum, and the solid residue recrystallized from EtOAc/hexane to provide 0.18 g (41%) N-ethyl-4-hydroxy-N-methylindole (4-HO-MET) with a mp 118â119 Â°C. Anal: C,H,N.

## EXTENSIONS AND COMMENTARY
Whatâs to choose between them? From the view-point of synthesis, the cost and availability of the secondary amine will certainly be a factor. Both methylethyl amine and methylisopropylamine are available, but are quite expensive. Dimethylamine, on the other hand, is dirt cheap but it is a recognized precursor to DMT and thus is difficult to find. In any events, the dimethyl compound is widely available in the mycological arena, and I suspect it would be simplest to stay with nature.
