## Overview

### Description

This compound belongs to the class of organic compounds known as aralkylamines. These are alkylamines in which the alkyl group is substituted at one carbon atom by an aromatic hydrocarbyl group.

### Background

Methylphenidate is a central nervous system stimulant used most commonly in the treatment of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and for narcolepsy. Also known as the marketed products Ritalin, Concerta, or Biphentin, methylphenidate is used with other treatment modalities (psychological, educational, cognitive behaviour therapy, etc) to improve the following group of developmentally inappropriate symptoms associated with ADHD: moderate-to-severe distractibility, short attention span, hyperactivity, emotional lability, and impulsivity. Long-acting formulations of psychostimulants such as methylphenidate,
Dextroamphetamine
, and
Lisdexamfetamine
are considered the most effective and widely used treatment for ADHD, and are considered first-line options for children, adolescents, and adults as recommended by CADDRA (Canadian ADHD Resource Alliance).
12
CADDRA recommends the use of methylphenidate due to long term studies, of over twenty years in duration, which show methylphenidate is safe and effective.
While its exact mechanism is unclear, methylphenidate (MPH) has been shown to act as a norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI), thereby increasing the presence of these neurotransmitters in the extraneuronal space and prolonging their action.
6
There is a dose-related effect of psychostimulants on receptor stimulation, where higher doses are shown to increase norepinephrine (NE) and dopamine (DA) efflux throughout the brain which can result in impaired cognition and locomotor-activating effects. In contrast, low doses are found to selectively activate NE and DA neurotransmission within the prefrontal cortex which is an area of the brain thought to play a prominent role in ADHD pathophysiology, thereby improving clinical efficacy and preventing side effects.
8
The lower doses used to treat ADHD are not associated with the locomotor-activating effects associated with higher doses and instead reduce movement, impulsivity, and increase cognitive function including sustained attention and working memory.
6
,
7
Methylphenidate's beneficial effects in sustaining attention have also been shown to be mediated by alpha-1 adrenergic receptor activity.
9
Clinical findings have shown that children with ADHD have an abnormality in the dopamine transporter gene (DAT1), the D4 receptor gene (DRD-4), and/or the D2 receptor gene that may be at least partly overcome by the dopaminergic effects of methylphenidate, suggesting a possible mode of action.
16
When provided as Biphentin®, methylphenidate is released through a multi-layer release delivery system (MLRTM) where 40% of the dose is provided as an immediate release and 60% is provided through a gradual release. Biphentin was designed to be an alternative to separate doses of immediate-release (IR) methylphenidate by providing a biphasic concentration-time profile when given as a single dose. The MLRTM release system allows for a sustained effect for 10-12 hours, allowing for once-daily dosing that covers the major times that ADHD impairment might occur (such as school, homework periods, during the work day, etc).
When provided as Concerta®, methylphenidate is released through the patented Osmotic Controlled-Release Oral Delivery (OROS) system where 22% of the dose is provided as an immediate release and 78% is provided through a gradual release.
1
OROS is comprised of an osmotically active trilayer core surrounded by a semipermeable membrane with an immediate-release drug overcoat. Within an aqueous environment, such as the stomach, the drug overcoat, which consists of 22% of the dose, dissolves within one hour, providing an initial immediate-release formulation of methylphenidate. Water then permeates through the membrane into the tablet core where the osmotically active polymer excipients expand, allowing methylphenidate to release slowly through the orifice over a period of 6-7 hours. Concerta also provides a sustained 10-12 hour effect, allowing for once-daily dosing.
Methylphenidate contains a blackbox warning stating that CNS stimulants, including methylphenidate-containing products and amphetamines, have a high potential for abuse and dependence. This abuse potential is likely related to the effects associated with higher doses of methylphenidate, which induce surface expression of the dopamine transporter (DAT).
10
In particular, increased dopamine in key brain areas is associated with the reinforcing and addictive properties of psychostimulants such as methylphenidate, and even amplifies the potency and reinforcing effects of other drugs of abuse such as amphetamines, making ADHD sufferers more susceptible to their addictive effects.
11
Concerns about abuse potential have spurred research into medications with fewer effects on DAT and the use of non-stimulant ADHD medications including
Atomoxetine
and
Guanfacine
.

### Indication

Methylphenidate is indicated for the treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in patients 6 years of age and older and for the treatment of narcolepsy.

### Pharmacodynamics

Methylphenidate is a racemic mixture comprised of the d- and l-isomers. The d-isomer is more pharmacologically active than the l-isomer. Radioligand binding studies demonstrate that binding of methylphenidate in the brain is localized to dopamine-rich areas, in particular in the prefrontal cortex which has been demonstrated to play a prominent role in ADHD pathophysiology.
8
In a number of animal models, methylphenidate enhances locomotor activity and induces stereotypic behaviours.

### Mechanism of Action

Sodium-dependent dopamine transporter
Inhibitor
Sodium-dependent noradrenaline transporter
Inhibitor

### Absorption

Concerta®: Methylphenidate is readily absorbed. Following oral administration of Concerta, plasma methylhphenidate concentrations reach an initial maximum at about 1 hour followed by gradual ascending concentrations over the next 5-9 hours. Mean times to reach peak plasma concentrations across all doses of Concerta occurred between 6-10 hours. Once daily dosing minimizes the fluctuations between peak and trough concentrations associated with multiple doses of immediate-release methylphenidate treatments.
16
Depending on the doses provided, Cmax was found to range from 6.0-15.0ng/mL, Tmax ranged from 8.1-9.4h, and AUC ranged from 50.4-121.5 ng·h/mL in children.
16
When provided as Concerta®, methylphenidate is released through the patented Osmotic Controlled-Release Oral Delivery (OROS) system where 22% of the dose is provided as an immediate release and 78% is provided through a gradual release.

Concerta also provides a sustained 10-12 hour effect, allowing for once-daily dosing.
Biphentin®: Methylphenidate is rapidly and extensively absorbed following oral administration, with peak blood levels obtained in 1-3 hours.
17
When provided as Biphentin®, methylphenidate is released through a multi-layer release delivery system (MLRTM) where 40% of the dose is provided as an immediate release and 60% is provided through a gradual release. Biphentin was designed to be an alternative to separate doses of immediate-release (IR) methylphenidate by providing a biphasic concentration-time profile when given as a single dose. The MLRTM release system allows for a sustained effect for 10-12 hours, allowing for once-daily dosing that covers the major times that ADHD impairment might occur (such as school, homework periods, during the workday, etc).
Methylphenidate (immediate release): Methylphenidate hydrochloride is rapidly and extensively absorbed from the tablets following oral administration; however, owing to extensive first-pass metabolism, bioavailability is low (approx. 30%) and large individual differences exist (11-52%). In one study, the administration of methylphenidate hydrochloride with food accelerated absorption but had no effect on the amount absorbed. Peak plasma concentrations of 10.8 and 7.8 ng/mL were observed, on average, 2 hours after administration of 0.30 mg/kg in children and adults, respectively. Peak plasma concentrations showed marked variability between subjects. Both the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC), and the peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) showed dose-proportionality.
18

### Metabolism

Methylphenidate is hepatically metabolized. More specifically, it is rapidly and extensively metabolized by carboxylesterase CES1A1. Via this enzyme, methylphenidate undergoes de-esterification to ritalinic acid (a-phenyl-2-piperidine acetic acid, PPAA), which has little to no pharmacologic activity.

### Volume of distribution

Concerta: Plasma methylphenidate concentrations in adults decline bi-exponentially
following oral administration.
16
Biphentin: The apparent distribution volume of methylphenidate in children is approximately 20 L/kg, with
substantial variability (11 to 33 L/kg).
17
Methylphenidate (immediate release): The apparent distribution volume of methylphenidate in children was approximately 20 L/kg, with substantial variability (11-33 L/kg). The volume of distribution after an intravenous dose (Vss) is 2.23 L/kg for the racemate in healthy adult volunteers.
18

### Protein binding

Concerta: In humans, 15 ± 5% of methylphenidate in the blood is bound to plasma proteins.
16
Biphentin: In blood, methylphenidate and its metabolites are distributed between plasma (57%) and
erythrocytes (43%). Methylphenidate and its metabolites exhibit low plasma protein binding
(approximately 15%).
17
Methylphenidate (immediate release): In blood, methylphenidate and its metabolites are distributed between plasma (57%) and erythrocytes (43%). Methylphenidate and its metabolites exhibit low plasma protein binding (approx. 15%).
18

### Route of elimination

After oral administration of an immediate release formulation of methylphenidate, 78%-97% of the dose is excreted in the urine and 1%-3% in the feces in the form of metabolites within 48-96 hours. Only small quantities (<1%) of unchanged methylphenidate appear in the urine. Most of the dose is excreted in the urine as ritalinic acid (60%-86%), the remainder being accounted for by minor metabolites.

### Clearance

The apparent mean systemic clearance after an oral dose is 10.2 and 10.5 L/h/kg in children and adults, respectively for a 0.3 mg/kg dose, and 0.565 L/h/kg after an intravenous dose of the racemate in healthy adult volunteers.

### General Function

G-protein coupled receptor for 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) (PubMed:22957663, PubMed:3138543, PubMed:33762731, PubMed:37935376, PubMed:37935377, PubMed:8138923, PubMed:8393041). Also functions as a receptor for various drugs and psychoactive substances (PubMed:22957663, PubMed:3138543, PubMed:33762731, PubMed:38552625, PubMed:8138923, PubMed:8393041). Ligand binding causes a conformation change that triggers signaling via guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) and modulates the activity of downstream effectors, such as adenylate cyclase (PubMed:22957663, PubMed:3138543, PubMed:33762731, PubMed:8138923, PubMed:8393041). HTR1A is coupled to G(i)/G(o) G alpha proteins and mediates inhibitory neurotransmission: signaling inhibits adenylate cyclase activity and activates a phosphatidylinositol-calcium second messenger system that regulates the release of Ca(2+) ions from intracellular stores (PubMed:33762731, PubMed:35610220). Beta-arrestin family members regulate signaling by mediating both receptor desensitization and resensitization processes (PubMed:18476671, PubMed:20363322, PubMed:20945968). Plays a role in the regulation of 5-hydroxytryptamine release and in the regulation of dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine metabolism (PubMed:18476671, PubMed:20363322, PubMed:20945968). Plays a role in the regulation of dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine levels in the brain, and thereby affects neural activity, mood and behavior (PubMed:18476671, PubMed:20363322, PubMed:20945968). Plays a role in the response to anxiogenic stimuli (PubMed:18476671, PubMed:20363322, PubMed:20945968)

## Subjective Experience

First synthesized in 1944, methylphenidate is a prescription medication which is
widely used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and narcolepsy.
During its history it has also been prescribed for a range of other conditions,
including chronic fatigue and depression, and at one point was also sold as a pep pill.

As a generic medicine it is available under a large number of trade names, with my
own supply branded as rubifen. Given that its potential side effects include
tachycardia and chest pain in higher doses, I exercised restraint, and placed an
absolute lid on my session by obtaining only four 20mg pills.

The question of dosage is a tricky one. Having experience of stimulants like
methamphetamine, I am not inclined to go too low, but there are enough hints (not
least the Drugs-Forum reference figures) to suggest that jumping in with all four pills
would be extremely reckless. I therefore decide to initially start with 30mg.

Note also that these pills are immediate release (IR) and not extended release (XR)
versions, so I should feel their effects within a normal time frame (for stimulants)

Regarding my expectations, given that I have subjectively found phenidate based
research chemicals to usually tend towards the functional end of the spectrum, my
enthusiasm is quite muted. I certainly don’t anticipate a cocaine or amphetamine like
high.

As I begin the experiment I am somewhat tired following what was (for no apparent
reason) a poor night’s sleep. I also feel a little chilly.

\`\`\`
T+0:00 I break one of the pills in half, and on an empty stomach I pop the
30mg (one and a half pills) into my mouth and swallow with a glass of cold
water. [12:20pm]
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
My plan today is to take the other half-pill in perhaps an hour, and then go
from there.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+1:00 Over the last hour I have gradually warmed-up, and the tiredness has
been chased away. I feel much better, sufficient for me to take the next 10mg
(bringing the total to 40mg). There is a slight buzz about the head, which at
present is relatively gentle.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+2:00 I remain in a heady-stimulated zone. Within this, I can focus well
enough, and I believe that I could easily hide my status in most social
scenarios. As expected this is primarily functional rather than recreational,
although equally, it is quite pleasant, in that I feel content and energised.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
Horn is of only minor interest with no real drive or compulsion. I also notice
that the dreaded phenomenon of stim-dick is unmistakably present (as per
other phenidates).
\`\`\`

\`\`\`
I now swallow another 10mg, bringing the total to 50mg. Note that I make a
point of drinking sufficient water throughout.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+3:00 I feel like I am on a functional plateau, and that I am not going to find
any further recreation or uplift. There is also a hint that I will be exhausted
when I come down, perhaps suggesting (rightly or wrongly) that I am on the
way down already. I therefore take a final 10mg, bringing the total to 60mg.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
I am tempted to flush the rest of the supply, but resist on the basis that the
compulsion to take more really doesn’t feel that strong.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
Physically, my hands are cold, indicating a degree of vasoconstriction. The rest
of my body remains quite warm. Perhaps this is psychologically driven, but I
occasionally ask myself if my chest feels tight.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+6:00 The intensity of the stimulation has diminished: it is still clearly
evident, but is now milder. I am not in the least bit hungry, but for recovery
purposes I force a meal down, with some fruit juice.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+7:00 I am now closing in on base. I feel generally fatigued but I am still
functional on account of the residue effects of the chemical. I am a little heavy
headed, as though on the verge of a headache which doesn’t quite materialise.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+9:00 I am pretty much back to baseline now: a bit weary, a slight head
presence, but broadly back within normal parameters. I have another bite to
eat and then retire to bed.
\`\`\`
Contrary to expectation, the night’s sleep was better than usual: I dropped off easily,
and other than a couple of disturbances I slept through soundly. That the last top-up
was much earlier in the day than normal for a stim-outing may have helped, but
equally surprising is that I woke feeling refreshed and relaxed, with no hint of
hangover or come-down.

The general mood of contentment lasted most of the morning and into the afternoon.
Whether this was afterglow from the chemical or just the after effects of a good
night’s sleep is hard to tell. It could have been a bit of both.

The ride itself was rather bland in comparison to that of the usual standard-bearers
of this class, in that it lacked euphoric edge and drive. Instead it seemed to settle
onto an energised plateau of contentment. This wasn’t bad, but in terms of reward
and pleasure, it was somewhat lacking.

Whilst it is unlikely that I will ever revisit this I can see how it does have a place in
the medical arena, and why its appeal as a recreational drug is relatively limited.

Finally, again with respect to dosage, this was in fact a little hard going at times: the
dose I took was too high. This perhaps serves as a reminder that as with most
stimulants overdose is indeed a serious threat. Take it easy if you intend to use this.

## Effects
Taking methylphenidate increases the concentration of the nerve messengers dopamine, noradrenaline and serotonin in the brain. When prescribed for ADHD, the drug is supposed to act as a filter for incoming stimuli and alleviate symptoms such as distractibility, attention deficit disorder, disorganisation and impulsivity.
However, due to its stimulating, energising and drive-enhancing properties, methylphenidate is also used as a party drug or to increase performance. Due to the increased release of dopamine, similar effects occur as with the use of cocaine.

## Risks

### Short-term Risks
If prescribed by a doctor or used as directed, sleep disturbances and irritability can often occur. Eating disorders, stomach complaints, nausea and vomiting are also known side effects.
Abusive use and higher doses can lead to seizures, cardiac arrhythmias as well as headaches and confusion.
Tolerance develops relatively quickly, which is why higher and higher doses have to be consumed. In overdose, Ritalin can trigger hallucinations.

### Long-term Risks
It is assumed that no dependence develops with therapeutic use of Ritalin. When abusing higher doses over a longer period of time, psychological dependence may develop. With abrupt discontinuation, withdrawal symptoms such as lethargy, apathy, depression and paranoia may occur.

## Safer Use
- If possible, do not consume methylphenidate intravenously. Due to the substances contained in the tablets, embolism (blockage of lung or brain vessels) can occur.

Methylphenidate is a stimulant that’s widely used in the treatment of ADHD. It is also used for narcolepsy and has been looked at for many other conditions.

Outside of medical settings, it can provide recreational and work-enhancing effects. As such, prescriptions are often diverted.

The effects provided by methylphenidate (e.g. stimulation and euphoria) are generally less significant than what’s seen with an amphetamine like [adderall](http://thedrugclassroom.com/video/adderall/) .

  "wikipedia": `# Methylphenidate
*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylphenidate*

Methylphenidate, sold under the brand name Ritalin and Concerta, among others, is a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant used in the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and narcolepsy. It may be taken by mouth or applied to the skin, and different formulations have varying durations of effect. For ADHD, the effectiveness of methylphenidate is comparable to atomoxetine but modestly lower than amphetamine. Methylphenidate reduces core ADHD symptoms and may do so in part by enhancing cognitive control of behavior (i.e., working memory and inhibitory control). 
At therapeutic doses, methylphenidate increases alertness and concentration and reduces hyperactivity and impulsive behavior in individuals with ADHD. Common side effects include loss of appetite, weight loss, trouble sleeping, and small increases in heart rate and blood pressure. Long-term treatment in children has been associated with slightly slower growth. Methylphenidate can be misused; dependence and withdrawal are mainly reported with high-dose or non-medical use and are uncommon at therapeutic doses.
Methylphenidate is believed to work by blocking the reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine by neurons. It is a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant of the phenethylamine and piperidine classes. It is available as a generic medication. In 2023, it was the 50th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 13 million prescriptions.

## Uses

### Medical

Methylphenidate is most commonly used to treat ADHD and narcolepsy.

#### Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder

Methylphenidate is used for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The dosage may vary and is titrated to effect, with some guidelines recommending initial treatment with a low dose. Methylphenidate is available in both immediate-release and modified-release formulations. Methylphenidate is not approved for children under six years of age.
The International Consensus Statement on ADHD shows that the results from systematic reviews, meta-analyses and large scale studies are clear: methylphenidate is safe and among the most efficacious drugs in all of medicine; treatment in the long-term substantially reduces accidental injuries, traumatic brain injury, substance abuse, cigarette smoking, educational underachievement, bone fractures, sexually transmitted infections, depression, suicide, criminal activity, teenage pregnancy, vehicle crashes, burn injuries and overall-cause mortality, and eliminates the increased risk for obesity.
One committee from the World Health Organization (WHO) responsible for the World Health Organization Essential Medicines List rejected an application in 2019, and a second application endorsed by 51 professional medical groups in 2021, for methylphenidate's inclusion due to uncertainty about its efficacy and safety. However, in November 2023, the WHO Mental Health Gap Action Programme Guidelines for mental, neurological, and substance use disorders recommended that methylphenidate should be considered for children aged 6 years and older who have ADHD, noting specifically that, "methylphenidate treatment shows substantial effects on symptom reduction", in addition to other WHO publications. In 2024, the European Society for Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (ESCAP) and the American Academy of Paediatrics (AAP) endorsed the inclusion of methylphenidate in the WHO EML. A new application for methylphenidate's inclusion is currently pending review, having sparked debate in the comment process among researchers engaged in the evaluation of the evidence-base.
Safety and efficacy data have been reviewed extensively by medical regulators (e.g., the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency), the developers of evidence-based national guidelines (e.g., the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence and the American Academy of Pediatrics), and government agencies who have endorsed these guidelines (e.g., the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council). These professional groups unanimously conclude, based on the scientific evidence, that methylphenidate is safe and effective and should be considered as a first-line treatment for ADHD.
Since ADHD diagnosis has increased around the world, methylphenidate may be misused as a "study drug" by some populations, which may be harmful. This also applies to people who may be experiencing a different issue and are misdiagnosed with ADHD. People in this category are prone to experience the negative side-effects of the drug, which can worsen their condition.
Long-term meta-analyses and systematic reviews show that the medications used to treat ADHD are not associated with observed deficits in brain structure, but with improved brain development and functioning, most prominently in inferior frontal and striatal regions. The most comprehensive meta-analysis available (19 studies with over 3.9 million participants) found "no statistically significant association between ADHD medications [including methylphenidate] and the risk of cardiovascular event among children and adolescents, young and middle-aged adults, or older adults"; as do other systematic reviews and meta-analyses.

#### Narcolepsy

Narcolepsy, a chronic sleep disorder characterized by overwhelming daytime drowsiness and uncontrollable sleep, is treated primarily with stimulants. Methylphenidate is considered effective in increasing wakefulness, vigilance, and performance. Methylphenidate improves measures of somnolence on standardized tests, such as the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT), but performance does not improve to levels comparable to healthy people.

#### Other medical uses

Methylphenidate may also be prescribed for off-label use in treatment-resistant cases of bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder. It can also improve depression in several groups, including stroke, cancer, and HIV-positive patients. There is weak evidence in favor of methylphenidate's effectiveness for depression, including providing additional benefit in combination with antidepressants. In individuals with terminal cancer, methylphenidate can be used to counteract opioid-induced somnolence, to increase the analgesic effects of opioids, to treat depression, and to improve cognitive function. A 2021 systematic review and meta-analysis found that all studies on geriatric depression reported positive results of methylphenidate use; the review recommended short-term use in combination with citalopram. A 2018 review found low-quality evidence supporting its use to treat apathy as seen in Alzheimer's disease, in addition to slight benefits for cognition and cognitive performance.

### Enhancing performance

Methylphenidate's efficacy as an athletic performance enhancer, cognitive enhancer, aphrodisiac, and euphoriant is supported by research. However, the manner in which methylphenidate is used for these purposes (high dosages, alternate routes of administration, during sleep deprivation, etc.) can result in severe unintended side effects.
A 2015 review found that therapeutic doses of amphetamine and methylphenidate result in modest improvements in cognition, including working memory, episodic memory, and inhibitory control, in normal healthy adults; the cognition-enhancing effects of these drugs are known to occur through the indirect activation of both dopamine receptor D1 and adrenoceptor α2 in the prefrontal cortex. Methylphenidate and other ADHD stimulants also improve task saliency and increase arousal. Stimulants such as amphetamine and methylphenidate can improve performance on difficult and boring tasks, and are used by some students as a study and test-taking aid. Based upon studies of self-reported illicit stimulant use, performance-enhancing use rather than use as a recreational drug, is the primary reason that students use stimulants.
Excessive doses of methylphenidate, above the therapeutic range, could interfere with working memory and cognitive control. Methylphenidate increases stamina and endurance in humans primarily through reuptake inhibition of dopamine in the central nervous system. Similar to the loss of cognitive enhancement when using large amounts, large doses of methylphenidate could induce side effects that impair athletic performance, such as rhabdomyolysis and hyperthermia. While literature suggests it might improve cognition, there isn't evidence that its use as a study aid without an ADHD diagnosis improves one's GPA.

### Available forms

The most common formulations of methylphenidate are based on its hydrochloride salt and are available as both immediate-release and extended-release oral dosage forms, as well as transdermal patches. Methylphenidate is a chiral compound with two stereocenters; clinical use overwhelmingly utilizes the racemate threo diastereomer, with the pharmacologically active component being the d-threo-methylphenidate enantiomer. Additionally, dexmethylphenidate (Focalin) is the single d-threo enantiomer formulation approved for medicinal use. There is some evidence that dexmethylphenidate has better bioavailability and a longer duration of action than methylphenidate.

#### Immediate-release

In the Ritalin tablets series (Ritalin, Ritalin LA, Ritalin SR), the volume of distribution was 2.65±1.11 L/kg for d-methylphenidate and 1.80±0.91 L/kg for l-methylphenidate subsequent to swallowing. Following administration of Concerta, plasma concentrations of the l-isomer were approximately ⁠1/40⁠ the plasma concentrations of the d-isomer.
Methylphenidate was originally available as an immediate-release racemic mixture formulation under the Novartis brand name Ritalin, although a variety of generics are available, some under other brand names. Generic brand names include Ritalina, Rilatine, Attenta, Medikinet, Metadate, Methylin, Penid, Tranquilyn, and Rubifen.

#### Modified-release

Modified-release methylphenidate products are formulations designed to deliver methylphenidate in two distinct phases, a rapid initial release followed by a slower, extended release—to maintain therapeutic concentrations over several hours, reducing the need for multiple daily dosing. These products include a range of brand names such as Concerta XL, Medikinet XL, Equasym XL, and Ritalin LA, each with different ratios of immediate-release to modified-release components and varying duration of action from 8 to 12 hours.

#### Skin patch

A methylphenidate skin patch is sold under the brand name Daytrana in the United States. It was developed and marketed by Noven Pharmaceuticals and approved in the US in 2006. It is also referred to as methylphenidate transdermal system (MTS). It is approved as a once-daily treatment in children with ADHD aged 6–17 years. It is mainly prescribed as a second-line treatment when oral forms are not well tolerated, or if people have difficulty with compliance. Noven's original FDA submission indicated that it should be used for 12 hours. When the FDA rejected the submission, they requested evidence that a shorter time period was safe and effective; Noven provided such evidence, and it was approved for a 9-hour period.
Orally administered methylphenidate is subject to first-pass metabolism, by which the levo-isomer is extensively metabolized. By circumventing this first-pass metabolism, the relative concentrations of ℓ-threo-methylphenidate are much higher with transdermal administration (50–60% of those of dexmethylphenidate instead of about 14–27%).
A 39 nanograms/mL peak serum concentration of methylphenidate has been found to occur between 7.5–10.5 hours after administration. However, the onset to peak effect is 2 hours, and the clinical effects remain up to 2 hours after the patch has been removed. The absorption is increased when the transdermal patch is applied onto inflamed skin or skin that has been exposed to heat. The absorption lasts for approximately 9 hours after application (onto normal, unexposed to heat and uninflamed skin). 90% of the medication is excreted in the urine as metabolites and unchanged drug.

#### Parenteral formulation

When it was released in the United States, methylphenidate was available from CIBA in a parenteral form for use by medical professionals. It came in 10mL multiple-dose vials containing 100 mg methylphenidate HCl and 100 mg lactose in lyophilized (freeze-dried) form. It was also available as single-dose ampoules containing 20 mg methylphenidate HCl. Instructions were to reconstitute with 10mL sterile solvent (water). The indication was 10 to 20 mg (1.0mL from MDV's, up to one full single-use ampoule) to produce a focused, talkative state that could help certain patients break down the resistance to therapy. Parenteral methylphenidate was discontinued out of a concern for the actual benefit and of inducing a psychic dependence. This is not truth serum in the normal sense, as it does not impair the ability to control the flow of information like a barbiturate agent (Pentothal) or similar might.

## Contraindications

Methylphenidate is contraindicated for individuals with agitation, tics, glaucoma, heart defects or a hypersensitivity to any ingredients contained in methylphenidate pharmaceuticals.
Pregnant women are advised to only use the medication if the benefits outweigh the potential risks. Not enough human studies have been conducted to conclusively demonstrate an effect of methylphenidate on fetal development. In 2018, a review concluded that it has not been teratogenic in rats and rabbits, and that it "is not a major human teratogen".

## Adverse effects

The most common side effects associated with methylphenidate (in standard and extended-release formulations) are appetite loss, dry mouth, anxiety/nervousness, nausea, and insomnia. Gastrointestinal adverse effects may include abdominal pain and weight loss. Nervous system adverse effects may include akathisia (agitation/restlessness), irritability, dyskinesia (tics), lethargy (drowsiness/fatigue), and dizziness. Cardiac adverse effects may include palpitations, changes in blood pressure, and heart rate (typically mild), and tachycardia (rapid heart rate). Ophthalmologic adverse effects may include blurred vision and dry eyes, with less frequent reports of diplopia and mydriasis. In some cases, tolerance might be an issue with stimulants like methylphenidate.
Results from a 2024 systematic review showed that methylphenidate significantly improves ADHD symptoms and broadband measures but can cause appetite suppression and other adverse events in children and adolescents. Smokers with ADHD who take methylphenidate may increase their nicotine dependence, and smoke more often than before they began using methylphenidate, with increased nicotine cravings and an average increase of 1.3 cigarettes per day.
There is some evidence of mild reductions in height with prolonged treatment in children. This has been estimated at 1 centimetre (0.4 in) or less per year during the first three years with a total decrease of 3 centimetres (1.2 in) over 10 years.
Hypersensitivity (including skin rash, urticaria, and fever) is sometimes reported when using transdermal methylphenidate. The Daytrana patch has a much higher rate of skin reactions than oral methylphenidate.
Methylphenidate can worsen psychosis in people who are psychotic, and in very rare cases it has been associated with the emergence of new psychotic symptoms. It should be used with extreme caution in people with bipolar disorder due to the potential induction of mania or hypomania. There have been very rare reports of suicidal ideation, but some authors claim that evidence does not support a link. Logorrhea is occasionally reported and visual hallucinations are very rarely reported. Priapism is a very rare adverse event that can be potentially serious.
U.S. Food and Drug Administration-commissioned studies in 2011 indicate that in children, young adults, and adults, there is no association between serious adverse cardiovascular events (sudden death, heart attack, and stroke) and the medical use of methylphenidate or other ADHD stimulants.
Because some adverse effects may only emerge during chronic use of methylphenidate, a constant watch for adverse effects is recommended.
A 2018 Cochrane review found the drug "may be associated with a number of serious adverse events as well as a large number of non‐serious adverse events in children and adolescents". It stated "it is not possible to accurately estimate the actual risk of adverse events" because the quality of evidence in the 260 studies assessed was "very low".

### Overdose

The symptoms of a moderate acute overdose of methylphenidate primarily arise from central nervous system overstimulation; these symptoms include: vomiting, nausea, agitation, tremors, hyperreflexia, muscle twitching, euphoria, confusion, hallucinations, delirium, hyperthermia, sweating, flushing, headache, tachycardia, heart palpitations, cardiac arrhythmias, hypertension, mydriasis, and dryness of mucous membranes. A severe overdose may involve symptoms such as hyperpyrexia, sympathomimetic toxidrome, convulsions, paranoia, stereotypy (a repetitive movement disorder), rhabdomyolysis, coma, and circulatory collapse.
A methylphenidate overdose is rarely fatal with appropriate care. Following injection of methylphenidate tablets into an artery, severe toxic reactions involving abscess formation and necrosis have been reported.
Treatment of a methylphenidate overdose typically involves the administration of benzodiazepines, with antipsychotics, α-adrenoceptor agonists and propofol serving as second-line therapies.

### Addiction and dependence

Methylphenidate displays addiction and dependence liability similar to that of amphetamine. It has moderate liability among addictive drugs; addiction and psychological dependence may occur, particularly when methylphenidate is used at high doses or in non-medical contexts. Methylphenidate has the potential to induce euphoria due to its pharmacodynamic effect (i.e., dopamine reuptake inhibition) in the brain's reward system. At therapeutic doses, ADHD stimulants do not sufficiently activate the reward system; consequently, when taken as directed in doses that are commonly prescribed for the treatment of ADHD, methylphenidate use lacks the capacity to cause an addiction.

#### Biomolecular mechanisms

Repeated high-dose administration of methylphenidate has been shown to induce the expression of ΔFosB in D1-type medium spiny neurons of the nucleus accumbens, with accumbal ΔFosB levels accumulating over the long-term with chronic exposure due to its unusually long half-life. Overexpression (i.e., a persistently excessive level of gene expression) of ΔFosB in this subset of neurons is a necessary and sufficient biomolecular mechanism for many of the neural adaptations and reward-related behavioral changes associated with drug addiction (e.g., reward sensitization and compulsive drug self-administration).

## Interactions

Methylphenidate may inhibit the metabolism of vitamin K anticoagulants, certain anticonvulsants, and some antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressants, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors). Concomitant administration may require dose adjustments, possibly assisted by monitoring of plasma drug concentrations. There are several case reports of methylphenidate inducing serotonin syndrome with concomitant administration of antidepressants.
When methylphenidate is coingested with ethanol, a metabolite called ethylphenidate is formed via hepatic transesterification, not unlike the hepatic formation of cocaethylene from cocaine and ethanol. The reduced potency of ethylphenidate and its minor formation means it does not contribute to the pharmacological profile at therapeutic doses, and even in overdose cases, ethylphenidate concentrations remain negligible.
Coingestion of alcohol also increases the blood plasma levels of d-methylphenidate by up to 40%.
Liver toxicity from methylphenidate is extremely rare, but limited evidence suggests that intake of β-adrenergic agonists with methylphenidate may increase the risk of liver toxicity.

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

Methylphenidate acts primarily as a norepinephrine–dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI). It is a benzylpiperidine and phenethylamine derivative which also shares part of its basic structure with catecholamines.
Methylphenidate is a psychostimulant and increases the activity of the central nervous system through inhibition on reuptake of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and dopamine. As models of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) suggest, it is associated with functional impairments in some of the brain's neurotransmitter systems, particularly those involving dopamine in the mesocortical and mesolimbic pathways and norepinephrine in the prefrontal cortex and locus coeruleus. Psychostimulants like methylphenidate and amphetamine may be effective in treating ADHD because they increase neurotransmitter activity in these systems. When reuptake of those neurotransmitters is halted, its concentration and effects in the synapse increase and last longer, respectively. Therefore, methylphenidate is called a norepinephrine–dopamine reuptake inhibitor. By increasing the effects of norepinephrine and dopamine, methylphenidate increases the activity of the central nervous system and produces effects such as increased alertness, reduced fatigue, and improved attention.
Methylphenidate is most active at modulating levels of dopamine (DA) and to a lesser extent norepinephrine (NE). Methylphenidate binds to and blocks dopamine transporters (DAT) and norepinephrine transporters (NET). Variability exists between DAT blockade, and extracellular dopamine, leading to the hypothesis that methylphenidate amplifies basal dopamine activity, leading to nonresponse in those with low basal DA activity. In animals and brain tissue, methylphenidate has been shown to dose-dependently increase brain dopamine levels. On average, methylphenidate elicits a 3 to 4 times increase in dopamine and norepinephrine in the striatum and prefrontal cortex. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies suggest that long-term treatment with ADHD stimulants (specifically, amphetamine and methylphenidate) decreases abnormalities in brain structure and function found in subjects with ADHD.
Both amphetamine and methylphenidate are predominantly dopaminergic drugs, yet their mechanisms of action are distinct. Methylphenidate acts as a norepinephrine–dopamine reuptake inhibitor, while amphetamine is both a releasing agent and reuptake inhibitor of dopamine and norepinephrine. Methylphenidate's mechanism of action in the release of dopamine and norepinephrine is fundamentally different from most other phenethylamine derivatives, as methylphenidate is thought to increase neuronal firing rate, whereas amphetamine reduces firing rate, but causes monoamine release by reversing the flow of the monoamines through monoamine transporters via a diverse set of mechanisms, including TAAR1 activation and modulation of VMAT2 function, among other mechanisms.
The difference in mechanism of action between methylphenidate and amphetamine results in methylphenidate inhibiting amphetamine's effects on monoamine transporters when they are co-administered.
Methylphenidate has both dopamine transporter and norepinephrine transporter binding affinity, with the dextromethylphenidate enantiomers displaying a prominent affinity for the norepinephrine transporter. Both the dextrorotary and levorotary enantiomers displayed receptor affinity for the serotonergic 5-HT1A and 5-HT2B subtypes, though direct binding to the serotonin transporter was not observed. A later study confirmed the d-threo-methylphenidate (dexmethylphenidate) binding to the 5-HT1A receptor, but no significant activity on the 5-HT2B receptor was found.
There exist some paradoxical findings that oppose the notion that methylphenidate acts as silent antagonist of the DAT (DAT inhibitor). DAT occupancy of 80% is necessary for methylphenidate's euphoriant effect, but re-administration of methylphenidate beyond this level of DAT occupancy has been found to produce similarly potent euphoriant effects (despite DAT occupancy being unchanged with repeated administration). By contrast, other DAT inhibitors such as bupropion have not been observed to exhibit this effect. These observations, among others, have prompted the hypothesis that methylphenidate may act as a "DAT inverse agonist" or "negative allosteric modifier of the DAT" by reversing the direction of the dopamine flux through the DAT at higher concentrations, rather than by acting solely as a reuptake inhibitor.
Methylphenidate may protect neurons from the neurotoxic effects of Parkinson's disease and methamphetamine use disorder. The hypothesized mechanism of neuroprotection is through inhibition of methamphetamine–DAT interactions, and through reducing cytosolic dopamine, leading to decreased production of dopamine-related reactive oxygen species.
The dextrorotary enantiomers are significantly more potent than the levorotary enantiomers, and some medications therefore only contain dexmethylphenidate. The studied maximized daily dosage of OROS methylphenidate appears to be 144 mg/day.

### Pharmacokinetics

Methylphenidate taken by mouth has a bioavailability of 11–52% with a duration of action around 2–4 hours for immediate-release (IR) (i.e., Ritalin), 3–8 hours for sustained-release (i.e., Ritalin LA), and 8–12 hours for extended-release (ER) (i.e., Concerta). The half-life of methylphenidate is 2–3 hours, depending on the individual. The peak plasma time is achieved at about 2 hours. Methylphenidate has a low plasma protein binding of 10–33% and a volume of distribution of 2.65 L/kg.
d-Methylphenidate is much more bioavailable than l-methylphenidate when administered orally, and is primarily responsible for the psychoactivity of racemic methylphenidate.
The oral bioavailability and speed of absorption for immediate-release methylphenidate is increased when administered with a meal. The effects of a high fat meal on the observed Cmax differ between some extended-release formulations, with combined IR/ER and OROS formulations showing reduced Cmax levels while liquid-based extended-release formulations showed increased Cmax levels when administered with a high-fat meal, according to some researchers. A 2003 study, however, showed no difference between a high-fat meal administration and a fasting administration of oral methylphenidate.
Methylphenidate is metabolized into ritalinic acid by CES1A1 enzymes in the liver. Dextromethylphenidate is selectively metabolized at a slower rate than levomethylphenidate. 97% of the metabolised drug is excreted in the urine, and between 1 and 3% is excreted in the faeces. A small amount, less than 1%, of the drug is excreted in the urine in its unchanged form.

## Chemistry

Despite the claim made by some urban legends, it is not a cocaine derivative nor analog, however, both compounds contain a methyl piperidinylcarboxylate moiety with 2-carbon distance between nitrogen and ester, methylphenidate containing methyl (piperidin-2-yl)-ethanoate and cocaine containing methyl (piperidin-3-yl)-methanoate. Cocaine is a local anesthetic and ligand channel blocker with SNDRI action, while methylphenidate is an NDRI with 2–3 fold selectivity for the dopamine transporter (DAT) over the norepinephrine transporter (NET). Cocaine is also more potent in serotonin transporters (SERTs) than NDRI sites.
Four isomers of methylphenidate are possible, since the molecule has two chiral centers. One pair of threo isomers and one pair of erythro are distinguished, from which primarily d-threo-methylphenidate exhibits the pharmacologically desired effects. The erythro diastereomers are pressor amines, a property not shared with the threo diastereomers. When the drug was first introduced it was sold as a 4:1 mixture of erythro:threo diastereomers, but it was later reformulated to contain only the threo diastereomers. "TMP" refers to a threo product that does not contain any erythro diastereomers, i.e. (±)-threo-methylphenidate. Since the threo isomers are energetically favored, it is easy to epimerize out any of the undesired erythro isomers. The drug that contains only dextrorotatory methylphenidate is sometimes called d-TMP, although this name is only rarely used and it is much more commonly referred to as dexmethylphenidate, d-MPH, or d-threo-methylphenidate. A review on the synthesis of enantiomerically pure (2R,2'R)-(+)-threo-methylphenidate hydrochloride has been published.

### Detection in biological fluids

The concentration of methylphenidate or ritalinic acid, its major metabolite, may be quantified in plasma, serum, or whole blood to monitor compliance in those receiving the drug therapeutically, to confirm the diagnosis of potential poisoning victims or to assist in the forensic investigation in a case of fatal overdosage.

## History

Methylphenidate was first synthesized in 1944 and was approved for medical use in the United States in 1955. It was synthesized by chemist Leandro Panizzon and sold by Swiss company CIBA (now Novartis). He named the drug after his wife Marguerite, nicknamed Rita, who used Ritalin to compensate for low blood pressure. Methylphenidate was not reported to be a stimulant until 1954. The drug was introduced for medical use in the United States in 1957. Originally, it was marketed as a mixture of two racemates, 80% (±)-erythro and 20% (±)-threo, under the brand name Centedrin. Subsequent studies of the racemates showed that the central stimulant activity is associated with the threo racemate and were focused on the separation and interconversion of the erythro isomer into the more active threo isomer. The erythro isomer was eliminated, and now modern formulations of methylphenidate contain only the threo isomer in a 50:50 mixture of d- and l-isomers.
Methylphenidate was first used to allay barbiturate-induced coma, narcolepsy and depression. It was later used to treat memory deficits in the elderly. Beginning in the 1960s, it was used to treat children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) based on earlier work, starting with the studies by American psychiatrist Charles Bradley on the use of psychostimulant drugs, such as Benzedrine, with then-called "maladjusted children". Production and prescription of methylphenidate rose significantly in the 1990s, especially in the United States, as the ADHD diagnosis came to be better understood and more generally accepted within the medical and mental health communities.
In 2000, Alza Corporation received FDA approval to market Concerta, a modified-release form of methylphenidate that uses the osmotic-controlled release oral delivery system.
It was estimated that the number of doses of methylphenidate used globally in 2013 increased by 66% compared to 2012. In 2023, it was the 50th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 13 million prescriptions. It is available as a generic medication.

Approximately 22% of the dose is immediate-release, and the remaining 78% of the dose is released over 10–12 hours post-ingestion, with an initial increase over the first 6–7 hours, and subsequent decline in the released drug.
Ritalin LA capsules are marked with the letters "NVR" (abbrev.: Novartis) and followed by: "R20", "R30", or "R40", depending on the (mg) dosage strength. Ritalin LA provides two standard doses – half the total dose being released immediately and the other half released four hours later. In total, each capsule is effective for about eight hours.
Metadate CD capsules contain two types of beads: 30% are immediate-release, and the other 70% are evenly sustained release.
Medikinet Retard/CR/Adult/Modified Release tablets are an extended-release oral capsule form of methylphenidate. It delivers 50% of the dosage as IR MPH and the remaining 50% in 3–4 hours.
Jornay PM is a delayed release formulation that is taken at bedtime. An outer polymer coating delays the initial release of the drug until 8 hours after administration, after which an inner coating regulates the rate of drug absorption. Peak plasma concentration occurs 14 hours following administration. This formulation was motivated by the need for a pediatric ADHD medication that is active immediately after morning waking, as most long-acting formulations exhibit a delay between administration and absorption that leads to inadequate therapeutic effect in the early morning.

### Cost

Brand-name and generic formulations are available.

### Legal status

Internationally, methylphenidate is a Schedule II drug under the Convention on Psychotropic Substances. Its legal status varies by jurisdiction.

### Controversy

Methylphenidate has been the subject of controversy in relation to its use in the treatment of ADHD. The prescription of psychostimulant medication to children to reduce ADHD symptoms has been a major point of criticism. The contention that methylphenidate acts as a gateway drug has been discredited by multiple sources, according to which abuse is statistically very low and "stimulant therapy in childhood does not increase the risk for subsequent drug and alcohol abuse disorders later in life". A study found that ADHD medication was not associated with an increased risk of cigarette use, and in fact, stimulant treatments such as Ritalin seemed to lower this risk. People treated with stimulants such as methylphenidate during childhood were less likely to have substance use disorders in adulthood.
Among countries with the highest rates of use of methylphenidate medication is Iceland, where research shows that the drug was the most commonly used substance among people who inject drugs. The study involved 108 people who inject drugs and 88% of them had injected methylphenidate within the last 30 days and for 63% of them, methylphenidate was the most preferred substance.
Treatment of ADHD by way of methylphenidate has led to legal actions, including malpractice suits regarding informed consent, inadequate information on side effects, misdiagnosis, and coercive use of medications by school systems.

## Etymology

The word methylphenidate is a portmanteau of the chemical name, Methyl-2-phenyl-2-(piperidin-2-yl) acetate.
The name "Ritalin" derives from Marguerite "Rita" Panizzon, the wife of Leandro Panizzon, who first synthesized the drug in 1944. Rita was the first person to take methylphenidate and described its effects to her husband.

## Research

### Apathy

Methylphenidate may be effective as a treatment for apathy in Alzheimer's disease and other conditions. It may also be useful in the treatment of more severe disorders of diminished motivation, like abulia and akinetic mutism.

### Schizophrenia

Methylphenidate has been shown to reduce rates of hospitalization in patients with schizophrenia, although repeated, elevated doses can provoke psychosis.

### Addiction

Methylphenidate has shown some benefits as a replacement therapy for individuals who are addicted to and dependent upon methamphetamine. Methylphenidate and amphetamine have been investigated as a chemical replacement for the treatment of cocaine addiction. Its effectiveness in treatment of cocaine or psychostimulant addiction or psychological dependence has not been proven.

### Social anxiety

Methylphenidate has been reported to be effective in the treatment of social anxiety disorder in people who are comorbid for both this condition and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in small preliminary clinical studies and case reports.
