## Subjective Experience

The development of MEAI was greeted by the unprecedented: positive reports by the
mainstream media. Even the most insidious of propagandists, the Daily Mail,
refrained from its usual hysteria, with a report under the banner headline "Could a
legal high that mimics ecstasy stop people from boozing? Party drug is patented for
use as “binge mitigation agent". The more credible New Scientist led with "Could a
legal high that mimics ecstasy stop people from boozing? Party drug is patented for
use as “binge mitigation agent".

MEAI was reputedly designed by the inventor of mephedrone, Dr Zee, and donated
to Professor David Nutt's charitable research group DrugScience. However, the
chemical itself didn't find its way to the clearnet for over a year. Strangely, when it
did, despite this free publicity, the uptake was muted.

Trip reports were also extremely thin on the ground. Other than the initial dose-
unspecified sorties covered in the above media articles, I could only find a couple of
direct first-hand accounts, both of which were posted on the same forum.

The first post specified a dose of 13mg, with an additional 10mg added later. The
second report cited 15mg. The threshold dose stated on the vendor’s website was
5-8mg.

For my own experiment, I weighed 20mg on my scales, which was possibly 2-3mg
more, given my clumsiness. Whilst this was the highest single dose I had ever seen
posted, this did appear to be reasonable, given the overall context. Note that I had
performed a small allergy test a month or so earlier.

\`\`\`
T+0.00 Bombing it on an empty stomach with water, the taste is a little like
MDAI, but not quite as foul. I sit around, tinkering on my PC, and wait. I
occasionally stroll around the house. [6pm].
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+0.30 I feel nothing at all, which is expected, given the anticipated 2 hour
onset. I put the kettle on and sip on a cup of chamomile tea.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+1.00 A slight buzz-like haze has developed, but with clarity if I focus. I also
feel a degree of contentedness. It is very mild, but it is there.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+1.30 There is no significant change at this point, other than an increase in
intensity. It has a mild drifty feel, but with the ability to sharpen at will. There
is also some sort of mellow intoxication emerging. I am content, but hoping
for more to happen.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
I deliberately think about alcohol. Would I like a beer? Not really, but I didn't
want one beforehand, so perhaps this doesn't add much. Could I actually
drink a beer? Yes, I believe so.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
Is there horn? Is there any particular enhancement or additional libido or
drive? There could be something minimal, but it’s not manic by any means.
However, unlike with alcohol use, I would be functional.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+2.00 The effects appear to have become more established. I note that I have
dilated pupils, although not full saucers. Simultaneously, I feel like I am on a
plateau and that this will go no further.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
I feel a little intoxicated, and as the online reports mentioned, if I thought of
this from a certain perspective I could describe it as being slightly drunk, but
without being groggy. In other words, a mild inebriation, with clarity, and no
urge to act like an ego-inflated jerk. There is not really any euphoria, but there
is a head buzz and a little sedation.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
Would this stop me drinking if I had a nice pint of beer in front of me, as
suggested by the media? Not at this point.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
Would I drink a pint of fluid instead of beer, if it contained MEAI and tasted
pleasant? Yes, I probably would.
\`\`\`

\`\`\`
I am hungry, which has nothing to do with the MEAI: I haven't eaten since
lunch time. However, this chemical clearly doesn’t suppress appetite, as many
stimulants do. The food itself tastes normal.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
This is not unpleasant, but it is not particularly thrilling either. Quite nice is
probably a good way of putting it. There's psychoactivity there, via a hazy high
and other mild symptoms, but there is no significant oomph. I feel content
and what could probably be termed slightly merry in an alcohol context (but
with less fuzz and more clarity).
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
I'm quite capable of holding a conversation in an unimpaired manner. I am
also capable of precise and rational thought, and performing non-trivial tasks,
but at the same time I feel that I am under the influence. In a social setting
this could provide the basis for positive interaction and relaxation.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+3.00 The show now seems to be over, in that I am settling back to base.
There is nothing negative to report. I still feel well and relatively positive, but
the buzz is dissipating.
\`\`\`
This was a decent sojourn, with some parallels to alcohol, but with the worst
elements missing. This makes it fairly mild and gentle, but not particularly exciting,
at least at this dose. However, I do like its short acting nature, which presumably
could be extended by redosing.

It could be argued that these effects lie somewhere between MDAI and alcohol.

A social setting may well provide its niche, as apparently targeted. Bear in mind that
for my experiment I was sat at a PC and moving around a house, which wasn't going
to light any fires. It would be interesting to learn what it is like when used outdoors,
or in company (either with soberistas or alcohol drinkers).

Would I use it again? Yes. I might well explore in the latter scenario, or increase the
dose (although this remains tricky to gauge, as no-one else seems to be using it).

A FEW MONTHS LATER: EXPERIMENT #2
A dose of 55mg over several hours was not noticeably different to the above. Indeed,
possibly due to other factors, the effects were less pronounced, and a minor feeling of
malaise was felt. These could easily have been coincidental.

Whilst I dropped off fairly easily, the night’s sleep was a little disturbed, which again,
could have nothing at all to do with the substance. I awoke feeling absolutely normal.

On the basis of the above experiences, I suspect that had this been released by one of
the bigger vendors, and a year or so before the generic UK ban took effect, it may well
have flown. Equally, like MDAI, it may have become an ingredient of a head shop or
online blend.

*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEAI*

MEAI, also known as 5-methoxy-2-aminoindane (5-MeO-AI), is a monoamine releasing agent of the 2-aminoindane family. It specifically acts as a selective serotonin releasing agent (SSRA). The drug is under development for the treatment of alcoholism, cocaine use disorder, metabolic syndrome, and obesity under the developmental code name CMND-100.

## Use and effects

When used recreationally, MEAI is reported to produce mild psychoactive effects and euphoria.

## Interactions

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

MEAI is a monoamine releasing agent (MRA). It is a modestly selective serotonin releasing agent (SSRA), with 6-fold preference for induction of serotonin release over norepinephrine release and 20-fold preference for induction of serotonin release over dopamine release. In addition to inducing monoamine neurotransmitter release, MEAI has moderate affinity for the α2-adrenergic receptor. Based on these findings, MEAI might produce MDMA-like entactogenic and sympathomimetic effects but may be expected to have reduced misuse liability in comparison.

## Chemistry

MEAI, also known as 5-methoxy-2-aminoindane, is a substituted 2-aminoindane derivative. It is the 2-aminoindane analogue of the amphetamine 3-methoxyamphetamine.

## History

MEAI appears to have been first synthesized in 1956.
Its molecular structure was first mentioned implicitly in a markush structure schema appearing in a patent from 1998. It was later explicitly and pharmacologically described in a peer reviewed paper in 2017 by David Nutt and Ezekiel Golan et al. followed by another in February 2018 which detailed the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and metabolism of MEAI by Shimshoni, David Nutt, Ezekiel Golan et al. One year later it was studied and reported on in another peer reviewed paper by Halberstadt et al. The aminoindane family of molecules was, perhaps, first chemically described in 1980.

## Research

### Alcohol substitute

MEAI was an early candidate of alcohol replacement drugs that came to market during a late 2010s movement to replace alcohol with less-toxic alternatives spearheaded by British psychopharmacologist David Nutt rippling to the rest of Europe.
In an act of gonzo journalism, Michael Slezak writing for New Scientist, tried and reported on his experience with MEAI after being provided with it by Dr Zee (Ezekiel Golan) following an interview. Golan claimed that he invented MEAI and originally intended for it to be sold as a legal high but changed his mind, indicating plans to work with Nutt and his company DrugScience. The goal was to develop MEAI further based on Golan's patents as a "binge behaviour regulator" and "alcoholic beverage substitute".
In 2018, a company named Diet Alcohol Corporation of the Americas (DACOA) began openly marketing an MEAI-based drink called "Pace" for sale in the USA and Canada. Pace was described as a 50ml bottle containing 160 mg of MEAI in mineral water. Distribution halted after Health Canada released a warning indicating the substance was considered illegal to market for consumption in Canada due to structural similarity to amphetamine. In a December 2018 article by CBC News, Dr Zee (Ezekiel Golan) was interviewed and publicly came out as the "lead scientist" of Pace claiming "tens of thousands" of bottles were already sold in Canada. Golan claimed the MEAI featured in Pace was "manufactured in India" and "bottled in Delaware". Health Canada provided a statement to CBC News stating "Pace is an illegal and unauthorized product in Canada."

### Clinical development

On May 26, 2022, MEAI was prepared for FDA registration by Clearmind Medicine Inc.; Clearmind Medicine claims wide intellectual property holdings to Ezekiel Golan's patents. In March 2022 Clearmind Medicine announced supportive evidence from animal studies in mice attesting to suppression of alcohol consumption. In June 2022 Clearmind Medicine announced promising results from animal studies that showed promise for treating cocaine addiction with MEAI.
MEAI, under the developmental code name CMND-100, is under development by Clearmind Medicine for the treatment of alcoholism, cocaine use disorder, metabolic syndrome, and obesity. As of October 2024, it is in the preclinical stage of development for these indications.
