## SYNTHESIS

## DOSAGE

## DURATION

## QUALITATIVE COMMENTS
(with 22 mg) âThe transition into the effects was a bit difficult, with a faint awareness in the tummy. But by the second hour it was quite psychedelic, and the body was not thought of again, except in terms of sexual fooling around. Very rich in eyes-closed imagery, and very good for interpretive and conceptual thinking. But the eyes-open visuals were not as much as they might have been. At the seventh hour, drifted into an easy sleep.â

(with 22 mg) âThe experience was very positive, but at each turn there seemed to be a bit of sadness. Was it a complete plus three experience? Not quite. But it didnât miss by much. The erotic explorations somehow just failed to knit by the thinnest of margins. It was a truly almost-magnificent experience.â


## EXTENSIONS AND COMMENTARY
An N-hydroxy amine has approximately the same potency and the same action as its N-hydrogen counterpart.

Maybe the N-hydroxy compound reduces to the N-H material in the body, and the latter is the intrinsically active agent. Maybe the N-H material oxidizes to the N-hydroxy material in the body, and the latter is the intrinsically active agent. Either direction is reasonable, and there is precedent for each. The equivalence of MDA and MDOH was the first suggestion of this. And I have made a number of NH vs. NOH challenges of this hypothesis. The interesting 2C-T-X series has provided a number of amines that are amenable to N-hydroxylation, and this is the first of them. And, after all, if you put a hydroxy (HO) group on a thio material (T), you have a HOT compound.

So, as far as nomenclature is concerned, the family of N-hydroxy analogues of N-H amines is known as the HOT family.

How does HOT-7 compare with 2C-T-7? They are almost identical. The same range of dose (centering on 20 milligrams) and if anything, perhaps slightly less long lived. Lets try some other N-hydroxys!

HOT-7, also known as 4-propylthio-2,5-dimethoxy-N-hydroxyphenethylamine or as N-hydroxy-2C-T-7, is a psychedelic drug of the phenethylamine, 2C, and HOT-x families. It is the N-hydroxy derivative of 2C-T-7. The drug is taken orally.

## Use and effects

In his book PiHKAL (Phenethylamines I Have Known and Loved), Alexander Shulgin lists HOT-7's dose range as 15 to 20 mg orally and its duration as 6 to 8 hours. The drug's onset and peak of effects were not described. HOT-7's properties are similar to those of 2C-T-7, which has a dose of 10 to 30 mg orally and a duration of 8 to 15 hours, although HOT-7 may have a somewhat shorter duration. HOT-7 may act as a prodrug of 2C-T-7.
The effects of HOT-7 have been reported to include being "quite psychedelic", very rich in closed-eye imagery, not as much in terms of open-eye visuals, very good for interpretive and conceptual thinking, emotional changes, feeling "smoothly stoned", lightheadedness, alcohol-like tipsiness and wooziness, social avoidance, and gastrointestinal disturbances.

## Interactions
