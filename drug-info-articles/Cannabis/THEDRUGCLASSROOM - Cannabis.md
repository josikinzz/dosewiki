# Does Cannabis Addiction Exist?
*Source: https://thedrugclassroom.com/video/cannabis-addiction-exist/*

Cannabis, like most drugs, is something people can become addicted to and it shares some of its action with other drugs and activities that can be addictive. Addiction is more likely when someone isn’t fulfilled in their life, has mental disorders, or has gone through traumatic experiences.

Since a psychological dependence on cannabis rarely results in severe short-term consequences, there may be a comparatively small desire to change one’s use.

On the physical dependence side of the topic (which isn’t actually addiction), cannabis does produce tolerance and withdrawal. The withdrawal isn’t as severe as what’s seen with heroin, for example, nor is it physically dangerous. Nevertheless, withdrawal usually does exist for 1-2 weeks when a heavy user stops taking the drug.
