Original post:


I just recived some t2 as a xmas present and I have a few questions about it. I have done my fair share of research chems but I know t2 is not like any other one out there(to my knowledge). I have 3 questions...

1.) Should I take this while around other people or is this more of a personal type of trip.

2.) should I take it on an empty stomach?

3.) how long does it take t2 to kick in?

thanxs in advance,

~Liquid

According to erowid trip reports, it takes about an hour to feel something, maybe slight discomfort, and two hours to really be in 2t land.

I have had a handful of 2C-T-2 experiences so I will give you my 


**1.) Should I take this while around other people or is this more of a personal type of trip.**


Well this I imagine would depend on your personality and the way your body reacts to 2C-T-2.  It effects everyone differently.  Having said that, 2C-T-2 seems especially well suited for solo trips.  The level of introspection 2C-T-2 produced was incredible.  I was lost in deep thought each time I did it.  I found being alone was a great enhancement for experiencing this.


**2.) should I take it on an empty stomach?**


Hell yes.  Absolutely.  2C-T-2 produced an incredible amount of nausea.  Way more than 2C-T-7 does.  Also fasting 'let's the body flow.'  Food tends to weigh the soul down.


**3.) how long does it take t2 to kick in?**


2C-T-2 kicks in pretty quick (within a half hour) but still takes a good 2 1/2 to 3 hours to peak.  The link in my signature leads to a trip report of mine with 2C-T-2

The first time I used 2C-T-2, I took a 21mg oral dose.  Other than this time I drank almost a gallon of vodka, I think it was the sickest I have ever been in my life.  I had no chance to enjoy it because I felt like I had eaten rat poison.  Although puking into a trashcan which to me looked like a far reaching space galaxy was sort of interesting.

After that I tried insufflation.  The first dose that way was 10mgs.  Too much!  I puked a little bit at first, but it wasn't too bad.  The major draw back was moderate muscle clenching all over my body during the first hour.  It dissapated however.  By then my vision was so distorted I could barely comprehend what I was seeing.  Everything was in a fast dimensional shift and nothing would stay still.  I closed my eyes later on listening to a psytrance tape and I became a floating consciousness drifting through sound.

The next time I tried it, I was peaking on MDMA and took a 5mg bump.  Within minutes it felt as if I had eaten 10 pills when I had only eaten 1.  As the MDMA wore off, I began to have intense audio and visual hallucinations.  I abruptly left my friends house feeling uncomfortable.  I have no idea how I made it home.  I couldn't see more than 20 feet in front of me because I was hallucinating so hard and everything was so distorted.  It was a really strange night and the last time I ever did anything psychedelic.

Now, I know these are more or less trip reports, but I figured since there's very little information out there about 2C-T-2 I'd share.  Gives you a bit of an idea as to what you're looking at.

The oral 2C-T-2 took about 45-60 minutes to feel something, but about 2.5 hours to start peaking.  It had a very serious body load and a really unique body high that I felt was uncomfortable.

Snorted 2C-T-2 takes about 10 minutes to reach an insanely visual trip but keeps building for about 1 hour and then has a very nice steady long plateau.  It had much less adverse effects and the visual hallucinations were completely out of this world intense.   What made it even stranger was how clear headed I remained and able to think rationally despite the intense hallucinations.  Again, taking 10mgs this way was TOO MUCH.

It's a very strange drug and has a strong chemical feel to it.  I did't like it.


**Mod warning: be very careful with insufflating 2C-T-X compounds like this and combining them with MDMA. With the very closely related 2C-T-7 this has produced casualties.**

And for what it's worth, I know religious experiences on drugs are tended to be laughed at, what with the numbers of transmitters and receptors being altered, upregulated, downregulated, an otherwise fucked with, but this one lends me to believe more strongly in Jesus than I think drugs can account for. I dunno. Take it or leave it.

I'm still planning my Mesc+2CT-2 trip sometime soon (my last exams tommorow, Hurray!).  I do have a shitload of Pedro to exact but was wondering about 2CT-2 and Syrian rue (MAOI-A) interactions...


I know loads of peeps are gonna flame me (telling me that that much of a combo will spoil the nature of each part) but I've always been one for experimenting (isn't everyone on this board!)


Dosages considered: 2g Syrian rue, 300g San Pedro (gonna turn it to sludge) and 10mgs 2CT-2.  Call me crazy!

**D:**


Took 2ct2 while peaking mdma....Didnt hit till the comedown....Negativity land ensued. I thought it might be ok since taking lsd at the tail end of mdma has always been great. But as far as im concerned Mdma + 2ct2 = No no.

However, I did find it much more useful mentally and therapeutically than I ever found MDMA to be, when taken by myself to work through some issues.  The type of issues I found it useful for were issues with various aspects of the ego, and repression.  My computer is moving too slow now, but if you search Erowid for author name "Lightwarden" you can find my trip reports on it.  It was a very significant drug for me and it brought me to the point where I could start feeling comfortable with tripping again.

check this out, [Preliminary Results with New Psychoactive Agents 2C-T-2 AND 2C-T-7](http://www.erowid.org/references/refs_view.php?ID=1198)


*The purpose of the current trials was to take two compounds which were found to show notable promise in the preliminary group trials and check the reactions of a broader spectrum of subjects having less personal experience with psychoactive agents. The two compounds are 2C-T-2 (SHULGIN & SHULGIN 1991: 557-561) and 2C-T-7 (SHULGIN & SHULGIN 1991: 567-571). To facilitate evaluation, first time use of both of these drugs was compared to the first time use of the well-known and widely used drug MDMA (ADAMSON 1985, BECK ET. AL. 1989, EISNER 1989, SHULGIN & SHULGIN 1991: 733-739). All trials were conducted before the placing of MDMA in Schedule 1 of the Controlled Substances act of 1970 and the enactment of the Controlled Substance Analogue Enforcement Act of 1986, which ostensibly applies to 2C-T-2, 2C-T-7, and similar compounds. This legislation accounts for the limited sample sizes in the trials of MDMA and 2C-T-7.

To prevent misinformation going around (I've seen it happen before when the CS act was mentioned), this does not mean that MDMA was scheduled in 1970.

Is it dangerous to take Alprazolam with it? If I was feeling to uncomfortable and took 3mg or so to abort the trip, could I end up vomiting in my sleep?

I would think that would be safe... just don't go overboard or you risk losing memory.  But better yet would be to work through the discomfort.  2C-T-2 helped me tremendously in understanding myself, and part of its ability to do so was through my reactions to the discomfort.

3mg is a pretty large dose unless you have some sort of alp tolerance.

1mg should do the trick with taking the edge off the trip and you wont have to worry about falling asleep and pukng.

What would you consider to be a full dose of 2c-t-21?  Everyone seems to disagree.


2c-t-21 is nice, subtle, but still strong, red and green insecty hexagony stuff again as 2c-t-2.

I predict 15mg will be good for me with 2CT21, but I've been wrong before about best dosage levels for a drug.


I actually think I'll probably use it at lower doses though typically, probably only however much I need to do it rectally for a low dose (maybe 4mg-6mg?)

Eeew. 


What? Thats my honest opinion!!


btw, S_S, T2 and T7 cannot be compared in any way. I think it is because of an article on erowid studying the similarities between the two that people started linking them. 


As for T21 - it is like LSD in when it comes to doses. Low doses produce mood-related effects that are VERY different from the full-blown trips that higher doses can. I think 15mg oral is a reasonable dose to start with.


One of my screwups is that I once uncknowingly plugged a huge dose of it (I think in the 20s) along with a dose of 4-AcO-DiPT. The trip was as intense as intesnse can be. Its on Erowid under my name if you're interested.

The most consistant feature of the 2C-Ts is their inconsistancy.  I've tried T-2 four times....and just don't care for it.  First time was nice, but the other three were lacking.  Add the nausea and vomiting, and we don't add up to a winner.  With T-7 the trip is worth the vomiting...not so with T-2.

Simple Theory (from a mate): People who don't feel sick / vomit on this stuff - are you fairly big drinkers?

I dont think it has anything to do with the strength of your stomach, but rather what receptors in your brain get activated.


On my rectal t7 trip, it wasn't until after I started feeling effects/come up that I puked for about 30 minutes. Then I settled into a BEAUTIFUL trip.


point being, even routes of admin that bypass the stomach can still cause extreme nausea/puking, so it can't just be that it aggravates the stomach.

You would be correct. Twenty-five dollars per pill, I lack a good connection at my college. Basically, the kid reasoned that they were from Canada so they are "legit". All I could consider were the amount of middle men profiting off of me. It's hard to put a price too high on a psychedelic experience though...

Some people are also just really aren't affected much by certain chemicals.  I have a friend who tried the same 2C-T-2, 2C-I, and 2C-E that we have and gets almost nothing from them even at high doses, while we are all incapacitated at half the dose.  He's realized that the 2C's just don't work for him because of his body chemistry.  Tryptamines work just fine for him though.


Might not be the problem, but I'm just throwing it out there.

its illegal to possess as a drug that you intend to consume since it is very close in structure to 2CT7 (an explicitly illegal schedule I drug).

First off my apologies for bumping up some of these older threads.  After reading for years I decided to join and start typing. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


A few years ago a cap of 2CT2 was given to me.  I took the 22 mg cap and felt it within the hour.  Some strong effects were having me pace around more speeded than acid.  The CEV's were very cool as well as the OEV's.  For all practical purposes it was like a strong speedy acid trip with phen type visuals. But it was a little too speedy as I couldn't sit and meditate like I could on other phens.  I had to almost keep pacing and felt like I had too much energy.  It seemed to wear off abruptly at about 6 houts and by 8 was back to baseline, except for the residual stimulation that had me wired a bit.  In fact at 9 hours had a glass of PT mixed with scullcap tea.  That worked just fine but I'm gald I took the 2CT2 early in the day.  I really enjoyed some of the psychic effects.  My wife was at work and emailing me all sorts of news from the outer world.  It felt like the outer world was tripping and was I getting effects from situations and hearing certain things.  At one point I got an email stating my cousin in law had died.  Drank himself to death.  But I was in an expanced state of mind and made a toast to him. He had been sick for a while.


All in all very interesting but the stimulating body load was a bit much.

I've had a few experiences with this chem now, and was starting to consider it to be somewhat "tofu"-ish.  I enjoyed the experiences at 10, 18, & 23mg, but it just seemed to be lacking something, visuals weren't quite there & the mental effects were only mildly amusing.  Certainly not bad, but I didn't really see why it was in the "magical half dozen."  Luckily, i haven't experienced any of the unpleasant GI issues some people have with 2ct2 so i decided to up the dosage and tried it again at 29mg, and whole different ballgame...  All my expectations were pretty blown away.  I felt like I had surges of energy flowing through my body, visuals were bordering on overwhelming, and conversations turned to very odd topics, or at least they seemed odd to me at the time, who knows.


My first 3 experiences were certainly above threshold, but I feel like i broke through to another level with the 29mg experience.  Anyone else have similar experience?  


I was still completely without nausea, so i may up it a little more next time.  Comeup was a bit intense at this level, certainly wouldn't recommend it to the unexperienced or fragile.  Duration was still rather short though, which is a good thing.  I dosed at about 11:30pm and was asleep by ~6am.  Definitely gonna try it again at a similar level

Does anyone have any information or thoughts on whether and to what extent 2C-T-2 is MAOI? Has combination of 2C-T-2 with xx-MDxxs led to potentiation of the xx-MDxx, or to symptoms of serotonin syndrome?


ETA: Also: *how* stimulating is 2C-T-2? Can anyone offer comparisons of, say, how a given dose of 2C-T-2 compares to another dose of 2C-E in terms of stimulation?


Oh, and does anyone have any reason to think combination of 2C-T-2 with JWH-073 would be problematic? I'd imagine it'd be no more so than combination of any conventional psych with cannabis, but if anyone's found anything unusual about 2C-T-x psychedelics with JWH-xxx indole cannabinoids (or with cannabis), I'd like to know. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I've been taking 2c-t-2 semi-regularly lately and haven't noticed any odd contraindications with pot, haven't tried any synthetic cannabinoids with it though, or any MDxx's.  I haven't found t2 very stimulating, in fact, I've fallen asleep relatively easily as soon as the peak effects were over, if I was so inclined.  I'd say its substantially less stimulating than 2c-e or i, but YMMV.


Also, anyone insufflated this?  I tried it out of morbid curiosity, and it wasn't terribly painful, like it's un-thiolated cousin or 2c-i.  Granted it was uncomfortable, but I got similar effects from 30mg oral and 10mg oral + ~4-7mg insufflated @ T+30min.  In fact, within roughly 20mins after insufflation I was substantially more visually "altered" than I have been on 22-25mg oral doses, and this was well before the 10mg oral could've had time to fully manifest... anyone have similar or substantially disparate experiences?

^ I'd also say that T-2 is significantly less stimulating than 2C-E, at any dose really. The peak of a full-dose T-2 trip is actually somewhat sedative with tendencies towards dissociation.

Mmm... sounds nice. I do like a bit of dissociation in my 2C-xs (*waves at high-dose 2C-C*). ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) I have a feeling that a combination of 2C-T-2, MDAI, and JWH-073  (all three of which I've recently acquired) could be lovely (although I've not yet tried 2C-T-2 or MDAI, so I'm just going on what I'm hearing), as they all seem to approach that thing you wonderfully describe as "a very fuzzy, hazy, warping mess of yumminess" but each from a somewhat different direction. I'll work towards that combo gradually and carefully, though, given possible interaction concerns with these relatively unresearched chemicals, especially given possible MAOIness of 2C-T-xs.

My highest oral dose thus far with t2 is ~33mg.  At that level I was getting some near MDMA like eye jiggles, but not feeling at all speedy, and fell into an easy sleep at roughly T+7.5hrs.  I'd say this dose was comparable in intensity to a 20-22mg dose of 2c-e, except I'd probably be up for 12+ hrs on that much 2c-e. I've also taken a couple doses in the 20-25mg range, and I'd put that somewhere near the 12-15mg range of 2c-e, but again, that's just me personally. The 10-15mg doses of 2c-t-2 I've taken were hard to compare to 2c-e, though the feel was similar, I think the dose-response curve for these two chems differs quite a bit.


 I'll be interested to hear about your MDAI combo, as I've been considering adding that to my collection here lately.  Do tread with caution though, while I imagine the MAOI effects of 2c-t-2 are probably relatively low, I'm certainly nowhere near sure of that

Thanks for that, very helpful... I'll certainly attempt and report on a low dose 2C-T-2/MDAI combo, once I've tried each of them separately.

I had 20 mg 2C-T-2 oral (stomach empty for 3 hours; cannabinoid free during trip and hour before; caffeine free during trip and from 3 hours before; not a nicotine-user) the other night. I was impressed, but I look forward to taking it further. It was starting to get interesting, visually, auditorily and cognitively, at the peak - which was for me around 2 and half hours in. It quite quickly subsided thereafter, to the extent that - at four hours after dosing -  I was close enough to baseline (still slightly warped vision, but otherwise...) that it seemed quite reasonable to attempt a relatively careful titration of methylone; so - after an initial test dose of 15 mg insufflated produced no notable effects, eventually had about 250 mg insufflated over a couple of hours or so, with normal effects. So, in this case, there seemed to be no MAO inhibitive impact on methylone at four hours or so after dosing the 2C-T-2. 


In matters other than the exact nature of the sensory effects (visually, it's *quite* different), this was comparable to 2C-C (at about 70 mg oral or so) for me. A roughly similar time-course (funny, I was expecting longer for the 2C-T-2... perhaps at a higher dose?), and a similar confusion and dissociation at the peak. As with the cognitive effects, this dissociation (I use this word with a pinch of salt, since I'm not very familiar with dissociatives) was only briefly hinted at during the peak, so it's hard to be precise or sure about this. Another sense in which it resembled 2C-C was a very nice body-feel during the come-up. Like with 2C-C for me, a rather MD-xxish warm lovely gentle euphoric feeling. Music (I was listening to the last couple of Muse albums) was splendidly enhanced. 


No unpleasant body-load for me. No motor jitters. Some odd, unexpected brief motor movements when lying down during the peak (I'm interpreting this as motor cortex psychedelia). No nausea, no disconcerting perceived temperature changes. Some tingly face, some cognitive stimulation of course, and it's quite probable my pulse and b.p. were raised, but I didn't check them. 


So yeah, I look forward to a higher dose with this one, so I can explore the peak effects more thoroughly. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

cool, thanks for the info.  I assumed MAO inhibition by 2c-t-2 would be slight, if any, I'll probably try a similar titration once I acquire some MDAI.


And I found the effects got a lot more interesting right around 29mg

Cool, I'll try 30 mg next time, then. 


Re: the MAO inhibition; is my insufflation of methylone a sufficient test? I'm not entirely clear on whether MAO is involved in the breakdown of monoamines taken through non-oral routes.

recentlyl combined this with ketamine & nitrous... not bad at all.  Took 18mgs 2c-t-2, then another 12mgs about 1:30 later.  Did several bumps of k sporadically over about 45min, definitely gave an "other worldly" vibe.  Did a fair amount of n2o a couple hours later, nitrous did what it always does ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

would you consider 2C-T-2 more speedy than 2C-E? cause i'm planning a rave for new years and don't know which to choose... i have lots of experience with 2C-E... so would like to try something new, but its been a while since iv'e done 2C-E and i know its a safe investment (i'm not that rich atm so i can't afford both![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)) i will probably also get a g of mephedrone to go with the 2C-x to keep me going...


but can anyone compare the two for me? bodyload? speedy? OEV's? CEV's? introspective? sociable? euphoria (i find 2CE extremely euphoric)?

Well, I definitely wouldn't go hoovering mephedrone while under the influence of 2C-T-2. There's still a great deal of debate surrounding mephedrone's specific method of action since there's been little to no actual research performed on it. However, if, as many have posited, it is similar to MDMA's, then taking mephedrone in conjunction with 2C-T-2 could be pretty goddamn dangerous given the latter's established MAOI activity.

To me, both 2c-e and 2c-t-2 are stimulating, but I would say the ct2 is more so. I wouldn't advise you mixing mephedrone with any 2c, especially if you will be partying/possibly dancing.

Thats very sound advice as i did get heart palpitations from mixing high doses of 2CE with mephedrone... but i still don't find 2CE alone stimulating enough for a rave, and theres no MDMA or descent pills going around... would methylone be safer?


oh and does CT2 burn as much when snorted as 2CE? (the BA is so much higher and i enjoy the strong come-up when raving)

I would say 2C-T-2 is much more empathogenic and sociable than 2C-E, it also has a nice body feel.


I don't know about the MAOI stuff, it all seems a bit dubious IMO.

I don't think the MAOI stuff is dubious at all. 2C-T-7 is definitively known to be an MAOI, as is 2C-T-2, though I believe to a lesser degree. Regardless, don't mix either of them with mephedrone. Just don't. I can't guarantee that doing so will kill or harm you, but I can guarantee that it might. The 2C-T-x's are empathogenic and stimulating enough anyways, rendering the risk to reward ratio of combining any of them with mephedrone unfavorable at best.

Me and many others have combined 2C-T-2 with MDMA and had glorious experiences.  It's actually a somewhat common combination and I haven't heard too much about people having problems with it.


FWIW people also combine 2C-T-7 with MDMA without ill effects.  I've never had a 2C-x give MAOI effects.


Mephedrone would be dodgy though; I agree.

2 of the 3 2C-T-7 deaths that led to it getting banned were in combination with MDMA. 


MDMA and 2C-T-# should be approached with utmost caution.

Again, I don't think 2C-T-2 is a particularly strong MAOI, nor can I guarantee that combining it with serotonin releasers like MDMA and (probably) mephedrone will result in serious health problems (namely, serotonin syndrome). All I'm saying is that at a certain dose, the two are definitely contraindicated, and since we have no real way of determining that dose save individual titration, it's probably better that people not mess around with the combination, or at least understand its potentially lethal side-effects before they do. While I've not heard of any hospitalizations or deaths that have resulted from 2C-T-2 + MDMA, I believe there are reports earlier in this thread that mention seizures induced by the combination.

How do you know that you've never experienced MAO inhibition from 2C-T-2? Certainly one may notice the effects of powerful MAOIs like the Harmala alkaloids when otherwise sober, but I can't imagine being able to pick out mild MAOI effects like 2C-T-2's, especially while in a psychedelic mindstate.

From the stuff I've just read the MAOI effects of T-7 only come into play when the person has accidentally overdosed.


Myron Stolaroff and company have used 2C-T-7 and 2C-T-2 on the downslope of MDMA with quite positive results that they have published.  However, they were careful with their dosing and didn't overdose by snorting eyeballed lines.


I dunno, I've used 2C-T-2 with MDMA and it was great, no hint of hypertensive crisis at all.  It was very smooth and I had a great afterglow.


Keep your doses in the therapeutic range and I think it's probably fine.  It seems any MAOI effects are only caused by overdose.


Check out how many people have used the T-7/MDMA combo: [http://www.erowid.org/experiences/subs/exp_2CT7_Combinations.shtml](http://www.erowid.org/experiences/subs/exp_2CT7_Combinations.shtml)


The majority are positive.


Check out how many people have done the T-2/MDMA combo: [http://www.erowid.org/experiences/subs/exp_2CT2_Combinations.shtml](http://www.erowid.org/experiences/subs/exp_2CT2_Combinations.shtml)


Lots of positives in there too.


Sure approach it with caution like all research chemical combinations, but it's definitely not something to be afraid of.  Also don't go saying that an MAOI induced hypertensive crisis is surely going to occur because that's simply not the case.  Possible; yes, likely; no.


It's all about personal sensitivity and correct dosage.

PepperSocks, What doses did you use when combining MDMA & 2c-t-2?  I've been thinkin about trying this combo, but am a little wary of the MAOI potential.  I'm thinking ~100mg MDMA & 8-12mg 2c-t-2, to stay on the safe side.  If my pulse etc are fine I can always do a little more.

Ive had a lot of experience with this substance in the past. Most of it very good. Usually insufflation is the best route ive found. 10mg does the trick fine at this route. 30mg is amazing though. Usually comes on in 5 minutes and peaks in an hour very intense this route the taste is ungodly though. Most people end up puking but that just intensifies it usually. Very speedy this way faster than 2c-e. Duration still is long usually about 10-12 hours

Earlier today I was on a comfortable dose of insufflated 2ct2, mild visuals, positive head space, and decided to do insufflate a very small amount of 2ce while I was still peaking.  What happened next scared the shit out of me.  I felt like I was dissolving, and I was struggling to not panic and to be rational.  I almost called a friend up to babysit, but luckily I found the strength to stay in control.  The only thing that kept me grounded was listening to the Beatles and knowing how to control my thoughts and aura.  Once the 2ce hit, I felt like I was coming onto a heap of acid, and I struggled to maintain my sanity.

What happened next scared the shit out of me.  I felt like I was dissolving, and I was struggling to not panic and to be rational.  I almost called a friend up to babysit, but luckily I found the strength to stay in control.  The only thing that kept me grounded was listening to the Beatles and knowing how to control my thoughts and aura.  Once the 2ce hit, I felt like I was coming onto a heap of acid, and I struggled to maintain my sanity.  I was totally not prepared for such intensity, but I was grateful to know that my dose could have just been a little bit more but fortunately wasn't.  Be careful with this combo people.

Any ideas on the true doses? For what it's worth, 2c-e by itself is *more than* double the intensity for me when insufflated vs. eaten.

Sorry I don't know the exact dosage.  Because I don't have a good scale, I've been insufflating very small amounts of PEAs until I reach a desired state.  I would estimate my 2ct2 dosage was around 10mg. maybe even less.  The 2ce was just such a small pinner, probably less than 4 mg., just a threshold dose.  Normally I wouldn't have even felt that much 2ce by itself.  I really need to get a scale so I can relate to you all better.  I should have known after experiencing the insane visuals of mdma with 2ce that this one would be crazy.  The visuals reminded me of peaking on acid and mushrooms at the same time without any one being stronger than the other, but the head trip was very intense.  Its crazy how much PEAs can potentiate each other even with mdma.

Well, insufflated 2C-*'s plus the MAOi properties of 2C-T-2 = intense^2, I guess? ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

This is one of the most perfect psychedelics I have ever taken. Ballpark doses for me are between 50-75mg orally, sometimes with an insufflated dose about an hour or so in. Insufflation is the most painful I have ever experienced, on anything. But it's worth it.


2c-t-2, for me, is like a cosmic chakra shower. Music is incredible with t-2, it's like a full-out massage of synaesthesia, bordering on ridiculous sometimes. Very playful and erotic, positive cognitive enhancement, and empathogenic. Far more so than MDMA. Visuals like treacle, sumptuous colours and sacred geometries in softy flows. 


I find 2c-t-2 to be very consistent, but adaptive to setting. Body-load is not a problem if you realize the healing potential of this compound. No problems with Effexor. Consistent plus threes every time. T-2 has also catalyzed in me a plus four, a complete onenesss with Goddess Sophia. 


Absolutely wonderful.

The MAOI effects are probably readily testable if someone were to just down a bunch of DMT at the peak of the 2c-t-2 experience and see what happened.

Are you sure? It might be just a strong reversible competitive MAO-B inhibitor, which I don't think has an effect on DMT administration?

I have an opportunity to get this. The only other RC I have done is 2c-e. it was amazing but not a very fun psy, was very dark and personal. How long does t-7 last? How does it compare visually and mentally?

Because to me it was important enough to get divided into subthreads; which I did a while ago.


2C-T-2 is in my top 5 psychedelics.

A lot of people seem to report having GI problems/nausea/etc on T2, but I never did.  Body load wasn't too bad, either.


I enjoyed T2 and enjoyed it even more when I combined it with 2C-E.

The only psychedelic I used is 2C-I, which is pretty light, fun and not so deep for me. I enjoy using it and now I am going to try 2C-E or 2C-T-2. Which of them would you recommend to do first? Which compound is giving you less negative side effects?

2C-E gives less negative effects when compared to 2C-T-2, however whether its better or not is up to the consumer.

It's generally the consensus that 2C-T-2 has more body-load (particularly nausea) vs 2C-E (for me, minor discomfort with T-2 vs almost nothing with E). 


I find T-2 to be much more enjoyable though.

I'm a pretty big fan of both actually.  I would likely recommend 2c-t-2 before 2c-e, as the former is generally regarded as more friendly.  However, it does have a higher occurance of negative GI effects, though roughly only 20% of test subjects experienced nausea (with oral ingestion, insufflation nausea stats are a bit higher).  


They're both interesting chems, just make sure to start your doses low and be in a comfortable environment.

I've found that the body high from t2 can be perceived as a body load if you don't know how to let the energy flow through you.  I understand why people get nausea from it.  If you know how to use the energy from it, you might find it has healing properties.  I've never consumed it other than by insufflation.  When I was first getting used to its effects, I would expect to feel nausea because that's what I read it does.  I've found that its easy to psych yourself into feeling nausea, but its just as easy to psych yourself away from feeling nausea on t2.  Its all in how you perceive the energy.  Also at those moments when I thought it was making me feel nausea, I thought to myself, now what good would it do to throw up and feel sick to my stomach when there is nothing in my stomach that needs to come out? (I had always insufflated it) That's how I came to recognize it all as just energy from the drug and realized it could be harnessed.

Recently I acquired some amount of 2c-t-2. I was pretty excited as it is not often that I got rare chemicals such as this one. Immediately receiving the substance I ate a piece of bread and parachuted 20 mg of material. It took maybe an hour and a half to fully come on. I noticed an increase in body temp within 30 minutes. Along with this feeling of warmth came a stimulant like effect. I started speeding about my house. Then went out for a walk. A couple friends picked me up and drove me around. I was tripping hard in their car, nearly ready to puke. I had the window down and my head hanging out and the euphoria began. Smoked a little bit of weed, took my shirt off and felt the love for all things. very good vibes running around my body. my friends dropped me back off at home, and my other friend picked me up and she took me for a walk in the woods. We stayed out for a while then went to her home and I met her family. It was an awesome 2c-t-2 trip. Running around in the woods was awesome.


So after that day I weighed up the rest of my 2c-t-2 and put it into capsules. This is generally how I take care of this stuff. I don't have my own precision scale, but I am able to borrow one here and there. So I weigh everything up all at once, then write the amounts on the pill capsule. most of my capsules were between a 15 and 25mg range. A couple went past that. 


So after a few weeks of having said substance and since that trip... the friend who brought me into the woods decided she wanted to experiment with the material. We each took approximately 23 mg of the material. I noticed slight effects, and she didn't notice much at all. She took a nap during the come-up. I laid down for a while, but did not nap. There was barely any nausea. None of the body warmth from the first trip. Perhaps, there was a bit of stimulation. Not much. I basically felt very peaceful. After 3 hours we decided to swallow another capsule each. The capsules contained 15mg each. We smoked some weed a couple hours later. It was definitely a synergy going on, but still the experience was not nearly as intense. I was at a +1 all day. She isn't sure where she was at. She was expecting to shit and puke her brains out all day while tripping hard. I didn't because i got the iron stomach... haha... But still I expected a pretty potent trip.


my first experience was mostly a +2 experience, but through moments of it I flirted with the +3. Between 1 and 3 hours after dosing I was in a low +3. It was good. Pretty intense. I could not do much, but just lay there and let it happen. Good vibes... dream-like thoughts... awesome time.


Any ideas on the difference between trips? Could it be that the potency dropped so much? Is my method of storage bad? The material is capsulized and put into a plastic bag, which is then put into a jar. 


my friend was telling me that 2c-t-2 is known to be... hydraphillic? And so it sucks up moisture... and maybe from being in the gel capsule it sucked up moisture and lost its potency... I'm not too sure about what he was getting at. He's pretty science based... and I am not. 


I was also thinking maybe just from being in the capsule rather than parachuting cause the decrease in potency. Could have taken more time to break down the capsule and absorb all the chemical? Any thoughts?


I know I should not have redosed... I should have waited and experimented on another day... but we had all day planned... and when nothing happens frustration can occur. 


One last thing. I am considering snuffing the material. What amounts should I start at. How high can I go? What are the intensity levels? How is the character of the substance different and similar with this method? I recently began trials with snuffing 2c-i. I prefer snuffing to oral consumption with 2ci. I enjoy the lessened length of time, the quicker onset, and that I save a little material. I generally snuff less than I orally consume.


Please share some thoughts? I am very new to this substance... And I want to play with it right... I was thinking of orally consuming 40 mg... but I don't know if that is too high. Any thoughts?


Sorry if this post is very disorganized. My mind is all over the place at the present moment... and I don't quite feel like re-reading... maybe I will edit later if I ever go back and reread.

**2c-t-2 in shulgin's half dozen?**


i was surprised to see that shulgin listed 2c-t-2 as one of his 6 favorite phenethylamines


i took about 25mg once and all i got was sweaty and anxious.


is there something i'm missing?

YMMV, as always.  Shulgin's tastes are far from universal.  Most people seem to prefer -t-7 to -t-2, and Shulgin himself indicates that -7 produces less bodyload with the only seemingly negative comment being that it lasts longer.  Shulgin is a hero of mine, but in no way should his subjective experiences be taken as some authoritative guide to the value of different compounds.  On a related note, he seems wildly inconsistent about how he feels regarding the length of activity of a compound.  Here, he seems to suggest longer is a downside and further comments on the excessive length of one of the 'tweetio' analogs, but in at least one other place I recall him going off on a bit of a rant about how the obsession with shorter lasting psychedelics says something negative about our culture, that people feel they can't set aside the time for a full day of deep introspection and need a fast food, on demand kind of alternative.  Then again, when discussing that 4-substituted tryptamine that lasts 2-3 hours but is otherwise similar to psilocin (4-ho-mipt or -dipt i think?), he also commented that a short lasting psychedelic will likely prove important if psychedelics are to make a resurgence in clinical psychotherapy as the risks of giving a neurotic or psychotic individual psychedelics would seem more acceptable if a potential bad experience would at least be over fairly quickly.  


If *all* you got was sweaty and anxious, one of two things is probably true:

1. What you took was not actually a 25mg dose of 2c-t-2, or

2. For whatever reason, your body does not react in the usual way to this compound.


25mg is a fairly high dose and most people would experience a pretty strong +3 from it.  If you just meant it was nothing special compared to other 2Cs or something then maybe it's just not the best one for you, but if you got literally no effects beyond sweating and feeling anxious it's possible you got a much lower dose than you thought or a dose of something else entirely, or maybe just inert powder...  Or, as I said, that you just have an atypical response to this particular compound.

^This. 2-c-t-2 is a pretty great chemical when its full effects are realized although phens aren't for everyone especially this one since its got a fair bodyload and nausea compoent to it.

I would suggest to start at about 10mg if your going to insufalate it. I have been expirementing with t2 for some time, the first time I tried 20 mg oral, but seemed to only bring me up to a +1.

After that I insufalated 10 mg and it quickly launched me to a +3. There was little body load, at the beginning (first 15-20 mins) I felt very nauseas which quickly went away after throwing up. After this I was nausea free and able to completely enjoy my trip. Since then seems my sweet spot is about 15 mg.

Hope this info helps a little.

Enjoy

I plan on obtaining some T-2 in the near future... once I have it, could I orally dose 15-20mg and then sniff another 5mg once I start feeling heavy effects of the oral dose I consumed?


I have no experience with RCs, and only a handful of encounters with shrooms, acid, and salvia. RCs are available to me at the moment, and T-2 sounds like a perfect mix of visuals and introspective thinking to me. If my experience is anything like the experiences I've read and researched, T-2 sounds like it could be my most favorite drug of all time.

Be sure to get  scale that can accurately weigh in the mg range.


Taking 15-20mg orally and sniffing 5mg later on to boost the effects should work just fine but be ware of the awfull burn that comes with snorting 2c's.

I currently don't have a good mg scale, but I'm sure I can get one. If worse comes to worse, I could just divide the 100mg pile into four or five separate piles that look just about equal. The worse that could happen is that I ingest +/- a few mg than initially intended. 


I've read that 2c's burn like a bitch, but I think I can handle it. :D

Do yourself a favour and get a scale. You shouldn't eyeball RC's. The method you described has gotten people into some serious bad tripping and it may even be dangerous.

^yep.


You can never be sure the amount sent to you is the amount you ordered.

mistakes happen and you wouldnt want to find yourself in a position of having taken twice or 3 times the amount you planned especially with you neing relatively new to psyhcs.

True.


I agree with you guys, I was just saying, IF I absolutely have to... I'm searchin' around for a good mg scale right now. Is there a certain shop that might be local that I could go to, or should I just go ahead and get one online?

What is the dose response curve like for 2c-t-2? Is it as drastic as something like 2c-e where a few more mg can send you to a whole new place - 16mg being far different from 20mg, let's say. Acid is different. 1200 micrograms starts to enter a new place when you hit 8,000 micrograms.... I never went that high, but I've talked about the dose response curve with people before. This is why eating acid is a little safe, especially in comparison with the RCs. 


I've eaten 23mg of 2c-t-2 before and didn't get too far out, so I was thinking of going for 40. I'm not too sure if that is too high. I have about 100 mg left and do not know if I will be able to acquire more, so I want to use the last of the batch to its fullest potential. Maybe I should try a trial of snorting it before anything. 10 mg would probably be alright, I suppose. Then maybe I can have a better judgment. I feel like this is one of them material I would rather eat, though. I just don't want to eat 40, and have that be way too much and end up on somewhat of a death trip. If I only need 30 to get my to the next level i would prefer that 


Eh, I guess what it comes down to it is that I need more material. With more material I would be able to hit different ranges. Ah well. Maybe it will come my way once more.


Any comments?

I wouldn't recommend snorting, it gave two very good friends of mine a physically very uncomfortable ride they weren't looking forward to repeat. And the trip itself was weird as well so all-in-all it sounds like a failure as far as ROAs go.

Well to each their own, but snorting is my favorite ROA. I feel no burn from it and the come is sooo fast and effects are way mor intense than oral.

To omicamushroom,

As far as dose respone goes, yes it steep like 2Ce. First time I snorted it was 10mg and was a heavy +2 light +3, my next time I did 13 mg and it launched me sooo hard and fast into a deep +3. Vivid open eye halucinations. For a while i couldn't even find how to get out of my room. Very intense.

I could never in good conscience recommend anyone snort 2c-t-2, however, I really enjoy that ROA personally.  The not tripping to tripping switch happens so fast & crazily... also the visuals take on a more unique character than they normally have (i find t2's visuals to be somewhat atypical for 2c-x's even when taken orally, though its the only 2c-t-x i've tried thus far).  And this is also odd b/c i'm not generally a fan of snorting things.  In fact t2 is pretty much the only PEA i'll snort.

So, me and a friend plan on splitting the cost of a 500mg order of some sort of RC (since we have a legit source now), and I was wondering if 2c-t-2 would be too much for someone with absolutely no RC experience and minimal psychedelic experience. I've only done shrooms, acid, and salvia a handful of times, but psychedelics are my favorite group of drugs by far, unless you count MDMA. I've read that 2c-i is a good starter, but I kinda have the urge to jump head first into this stuff.

I'm thinking of mixing a medium dose of this with some dried cubensis mushrooms.  They are good potency mushrooms and I usually take about 2.2g for good effects.  What would you guys recommend for a ratio of mushroom to 2c-t-2?

I have tried a medium oral dose (15 mg) and i didn't enjoy so much.

I felt cold the whole trip like if i get a flu: i was always thinking to take care of myself.

Visual part was not bad: i was able to manage to make me see what i want. I even convinced myself that my carpet was made of naked women and it worked ![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif)


So currently i'm not sure i will test it one more time. 2C-I, T7, C and E were better.


Is the kind of flu feeling i get what people describe with "bodyload" of t2 ?

I decided to follow this advice. And today I got a ziplock labeld "130mg" of 2c-t-2. I usually trip with my girlfriend, so what way is better to spend this amount? I think it should be something like 16-20-25 mg. 


Are there any bad interactions with phenibut? I have been taking it for 10 days. I searched a bit but found only one positive report.

I sampled this substance for the first time today (oral, 15mg on an empty stomach). 


No nausea or any vomiting and the coming up was very mellow as was the rest of the trip. A solid (++) throughout the trip and good visuals both OEV and CEV. 


I could really see this substance having a positive influence on your creative skills as an artist.


I don’t know if I was just lucky and hit the “sweet spot” the first time, but this is definitely a substance I will explore further.  Next time I think I will try 20mg.

Those aren't bad dosages at all. Though I would try a lower one first to make sure you and your gf don't have odd reactions to it.  Not sure about phenibut, i'd be careful about that as it is pretty similar to phenethylamine.  I'd guess if anything it could possibly blunt the effects of 2c-t-2, but obviously I'm nowhere near sure about that.

Hi everyone, 1st time poster. Just thought I'd share my recent experience.


I've been lurking a little on this site lately, I'm new to psychadelics, long time pot smoker. Recently I decided I wanted to go out of my way to find and try some psychadelics.


First up I wanted to try LSD (doesn't everyone?), but I happened to be hanging with a friend who had some 2c-T2. He said it was the first psy he ever did, and he said eating it was pretty mild. 


I went home, ate 21mg after having eaten a meal maybe an hour before and smoked some bud about an hour into it. It took ages to kick in, maybe an hour and a half. It was so mild, I thought I might've fucked up taking it somehow. Put me in a really nice mood, made me sensitive to colours and sounds, but I was hardly tripping balls. 


Fast forward to later in the week I decided that seeing as my previous experience was so mild, it would be a good idea to snort 10mg with my friend. He warned me about the pain and I'd done some research, so I knew that snorting it was definitely a more full on experience. I flipped a coin to decide whether I would in fact do the deed. 


Initially the pain wasn't by any means unbearable, about 7/10. 10 being the most intense pain you could imagine. But as soon as I'd had time to think this, the world started to spin. I didnt know what was going on, while the pain seemed to be getting worse. I had tears in my eyes and I kept choking because my sinuses were blocked. I started throwing up violently, my muscles were cramping etc. I was seriously losing it. we went outside to smoke a J, but I couldn't smoke it, I was fast spinning out of control. Trying to tell my friend that things weren't right. I started throwing up everywhere and I was getting majorly freaked out in the darkness. While I was peaking, for most of the 1st hour I could barely move or do anything. I just stayed in bed and tried not to be overwhelmed by the visuals and my sickness. Going into the bathroom to throw up was the worst, anywhere else I could at least try to pretend things were fine. The whole experience was way more than I bargained for and I would definitely not recommend it to an inexperienced tripper. 


After about 45 minutes, I grabbed my friends guitar, which was a major comfort - just to have something familiar to orient me. "ok this is a guitar, I can still play guitar" and I realised that I could play flawlessly, even though I had the shakes like crazy. Then I tried to focus on my hand and it looked like it was shaking all over the place, then I looked again and I thought it might actually be perfectly still and I was imagining the whole thing. It was almost dissociative, that's how hard it fucked with my head, I did not know whether my perceptions matched reality anymore. It was scary. Amazing but scary.


Things mellowed after the 1st hour or so, and that was when I began to settle down and enjoy most of what the trip had to offer. The visuals were intense, incredible. Maybe if I hadn't spent the peak of the trip in my friends bathroom thinking I was going to die I could give a glowing review of the whole experience. But I can't even say I regret it, what I truly wanted was a psychedelic tour de force.... and I managed to get through it.  I don't think I would have done it if I'd known what I was in for. I'm not sure when or if I'll snort it again.


I have 2 questions for the board.


1) what sort of tolerance issues does t2 have? is it highly tolerant and how long does tolerance take to diminish? is it cross tolerant with LSD in any way?


2) I have 2, 25mg caps of T2, I was thinking some time I would just take one of them. I've read of some people taking pretty high dosages orally. Would 50mg orally be a bad idea? Because I can only assume that 25mg, wont be that much of a difference over the 21mg I took first. It will probably seem rather mild compared to snorting 10mg, not that I am necessarily looking to emulate this experience exactly ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)

most psych's tend to have a 3-5 day tolerance, and there does seem to be at least some cross tolerance between most serotonergic psychedelics.  I personally haven't taken more than 32mg of t2, that I recall.  At around 28ism mg I started to experience effects similar to snorting 8-12mg.  At some point I wanna try a higher dosage, but haven't gotten around to it yet... so many drugs, so little time.  Regardless, I wouldn't jump straight from 21 oral to 50 oral, maybe try something in the 30-35 range.  You can always take more in a couple hours if you're not where you wanna be yet.

2C-T-2 and LSD would definitely have some cross tolerance.  To get the most out of it wait at least a week after having any psychedelic.


50mg would definitely be overkill.  2C's tend to have a very steep dose/response curve; meaning 23mg can be worlds stronger than 20.  One of those 25mg caps should be plenty strong.

Hey guys first post on here and I just got a couple questions


Right now I can either get 12.5mg of 2C-T-2 (dont know whats up with the extra half), or else 15mg of 2c-B.  I've never done any RC's before, just smoke pot once in a while, shrooms, and DMT.  And theres an outdoor concert coming up in a month that i was thinking I'd get one of these and save it for.  So which one of those would be best for it do you think? Or basicly, what do you prefer. And if neither of those seem like something that'd be good for a concert then I'll probably just do it on a weekend sometime instead.  And with whichever you suggest, let me know if i should just take it orally or snort it for the over all best time.  Cause with both, i'm pretty sure they're fairly low doses and orally might not be that good


thanks!

2c-b is nice and would be good in a concert atmosphere at that dose. I guess it depends somewhat on your area but I would say it's harder to come by as well, so may be a missed opportunity if you don't try it while you can.

I prefer 2ct2 over 2cb for dancing. 2cb gives me a more introspective and social trip. 2cb and acid is one of my favorite combos for wonderful amounts of enthusiasm present in conversation. 


If I do enough 2ct2 dancing is awesome. 12.5 mg is a low enough dose to get some positive energy to add to your dancing. 2ct2 has a rush for me that I have not felt with 2cb. 2cb is a little more gentle. The rush from 2ct2 leads me to want to dance because my body ends up feeling more comfortable when I am dancing. 2cb I mostly just stroll around. 


If you snort the 2ct2 you will trip good and hard... you may want to cut the dose in half. snort half and then 4 hours later snort the other half. I'm not sure if there would be much cross tolerance. With 2cb you could probably snort the whole 15mg and have a pretty gentle, but awesome experience. If you blow all that 2ct2 though you will be in for one hell of a ride. So be careful. 8mg was way more intense than I expected.


Also the type of music you are going to may influence which drug you may wanna take. My friend put on some DJ Endo and some hard style music one night and I was all about it with my dose of 2ct2. Fast paced music kicks ass for 2ct2 and makes me wanna spin.

Alright thanks for that info guys.  the concert is from what i can tell, all hip hop.  like Wiz Khalifa, Method man, Atmosphere, and then some other locals that i dont know.  I'm thinking about going with the 2c-b though cause i got a couple other friends who wanna get something for it to and have never done a psychedelic so something fun and mellow sounds good for them i think

tried 2ct2 for the first time yesterday. 20 mgs oral. The whole experience I found completely neutral. The body load was not as bad as I was expecting although it wasnt euphroric either. Not particularly stimulated or sedated. Visuals decent but nothing spectacular. Some introspection but nothing too deep. The only unique thing I got from this that I haven't experienced on any other phen was auditory hallucinations, that lasted just for a couple minutes.


I think this is as good place as any 2c to start with in terms of intensity. I have yet to try  2ct7 but out of the rest of shulgin's magical half dozen + 2ci , 2ct2 was my least favorite.

I've snorted 2ct7 and found the come up scary, not to mention the burn distracting, but have not tried this ROA with 2ct2. Do those who have tried oral ROA and nasal find that the bodyload, most notably the abdominal cramping and nausea, are less or the same ? I've developed a dislike for the 2ct's in general (2ct2,4&7) because they all cause cramps and nausea for me. This is not a problem with 2ce,i,p or c (not tried 2cb yet). 2CD also gave me some cramps but not nearly as bad.

That said, 2ct2 and 7 are both some of the most visually rich hallucinogenic I've ever tried, and I usually get poor visuals off of most psychs.

How long does 2c-T-2 last?  Didn't see any info on erowid so i thought i'd ask here.  I plan on doing 15 mg this weekend so I'd really appreciate an estimate of the duration.


And how often do people puke on this stuff?

while i haven't tried t-2 myself (still getting acquainted with t-7), i find that any stomach tightness or nausea is easily remedied by fresh mint or ginger tea. also deep, centering breaths do wonders.


the only time i've ever puked on a 2c was the one time i decided to dose 2c-e in the morning after a night of drinking. technicolor in the toilet ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Its a bit more nauseous than similar compound ime.  Those who are likely to puke, will at least feel sick (that sounds stupid but you know what I mean).  Me and a regular tripping partner have cast iron guts, he's felt a bit ill a few times with it, and it is the only ever psych I've thrown up on (long drinking day beforehand mind).  That wasn't at all unpleasant; defo worth a bit of a groggy belly for a short while if thats the way it goes ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

that  all depends how you plan on doing it. Orally ive never felt like I need to puke. insufflated (which is the prefered route by my circle of friends that did it in the past) you can pretty much bank on puking every time within the first 30 mins. I was the only one that never actually puked off this and thats for two reasons. 1. I would starve myself for 8-10 hours beforehand so there was nothing to puke up. 2. a dry heave doesnt count as puking. 

lol seriously this stuffs taste will literally redefine the term bitter for you. I can still taste it in my mouth to this day and its been 4 yeears+ since the last time I tried it.

I'd say it lasts about 6-8 hours for me.  As for puking, I almost always puked coming up.  It's pretty distressing to the stomach when taken orally.  I would bet that taking it rectally would reduce this and the bodyload significantly, but I haven't tried that.

my first time was this week....for me the puking only lasted 20-30 minutes but it was not constant. I only had to go into the bathroom 2 times for a very brief period and it wasnt that bad. (not scary or anything) after the puking subsided, (this was 23mgs dissolved in Orange Juice and drank over an hour period) I actually started to feel pretty wonderful and the next 5 hours were great with  the most amazing CEV's of my life  (WOW was all i could say when i close my eyes)...as well as amazing for relationship work, insight, etc.....  the next three hours being kind of back to normal with some gas and a headache. (i didnt rehydrate well enough)


if you arent a squeamish person, i think you'll be fine. and have some gas-x on hand for later in the night. it really helped me (helps me a lot on 2c-e as well) 


by 6 hours in i was eating grapes, oranges, and carrotts and peppers.


i will be trying this again for sure


thanks for the tip on drinking tea!


thanks

I tried it on Bicycle day(14mg). It was very bright and visual experience with feeling of nature and feeling of lying near the ocean of my (un)conscious. Comparing to 2C-I there wasn't so much bodyload, but nausea was so strong that I vomited several times. Unfortunately, no body high and duration seemed to be shorter. After trip I got strong headache(aspirine helped a lot). 


Side effects were more worse for my girlfriend, she even got 3 days hangover. 


Nevertheless, I liked this chemical. Any ideas how to lessen nausea? Is it better to take 2c-t-2 on full stomach or empty?

**Dealing with body-load**


I've never had a problem with 2c-t-2 with regards to it's bodyload. I have never felt any significant nausea, never vomited. Maybe I'm an anomaly here with regards to this issue, however I have been able to work friends through bodyload issues by talking to them and getting them to focus the intense body energy into a truely healing chakra cycle.


I have to say, this is just about as wonderful as a psychedelic can get. Once you get the hang of it, you would know exactly what I mean. Let me try to explain: many people get hang-ups on body-load issues with psychedelics, and can't get past them for the whole trip making it a shitty experience from their perspective. Whilst some psychedelics (such as 5-meo-amt) can manifest very unpleasant symptoms which are clearly poisonous, others such as 2c-t-2 create an intense synaesthetic psychedelia involing both the body and the mind; in most cases, people aren't prepared to let the process flow and so they create the cramps. nausea, vomiting etc. in order to deal with these energies; they are essentially fuelled by a feedback of negative associations and energy imbalances. The point is this: because of the intense synaesthesia, and interplexing between body and mind on 2c-t-2 (and other psychedelics similar to it) there is an absolute opportunity to go the other way, back up the spiral. If you stop resisting the energy flows, and instead let them become at the front of your awareness with all other aspects of the experience, they will naturally fall into a rythmic pattern of chakra energy flow - which becomes an full out massage. (don't be embarassed to let yourself go in the company of others... this is often what fucks it up).


So instead of cramping up and worrying about the next time you'll vomit, instead you are now in a state of outrageous bliss from the exotic energies discarded and absorbed all over body, through your chakra points like a complete 'chakra shower'. This is all intertwined with your setting; the synaethsia will just keep feeding back in and out of this system, making the whole experience one of the most sensational, visually rich, bodily cleansing, and psychedelicly sumptuous there is. It really does give you the opportunity to let yourself fall back into the natural harmony and rythym of nature. ![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif)

This one does seem to give some people headaches post-trip.  In my observation this seems more common with females for some reason, have no idea why though.

As for reducing nausea, pre-loading with things such as cannabis, mint, and ginger should help.  Pepto-bismal might be a good choice if you get really bad nausea, though might want to slightly lessen the dose (2-3mg) as some phenethylamines are absorbed more readily in a basic environment

Let me try to explain: many people get hang-ups on body-load issues with psychedelics, and can't get past them for the whole trip making it a shitty experience from their perspective. Whilst some psychedelics (such as 5-meo-amt) can manifest very unpleasant symptoms which are clearly poisonous, others such as 2c-t-2 create an intense synaesthetic psychedelia involing both the body and the mind; in most cases, people aren't prepared to let the process flow and so they create the cramps. nausea, vomiting etc. in order to deal with these energies; they are essentially fuelled by a feedback of negative associations and energy imbalances. The point is this: because of the intense synaesthesia, and interplexing between body and mind on 2c-t-2 (and other psychedelics similar to it) there is an absolute opportunity to go the other way, back up the spiral. If you stop resisting the energy flows, and instead let them become at the front of your awareness with all other aspects of the experience, they will naturally fall into a rythmic pattern of chakra energy flow - which becomes an full out massage. (don't be embarassed to let yourself go in the company of others... this is often what fucks it up).

> So instead of cramping up and worrying about the next time you'll vomit, instead you are now in a state of outrageous bliss from the exotic energies discarded and absorbed all over body, through your chakra points like a complete 'chakra shower'. This is all intertwined with your setting; the synaethsia will just keep feeding back in and out of this system, making the whole experience one of the most sensational, visually rich, bodily cleansing, and psychedelicly sumptuous there is. It really does give you the opportunity to let yourself fall back into the natural harmony and rythym of nature. ![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif)

This is an insightful post.  I find many psychedelics to produce this state... a highly psychosomatic bodyload.  2C-E is perhaps the biggest example I can think of, and 2C-T-2 is the 2C-T-X version of 2C-E, so it makes sense they'd both do this.  With both substances, many users report a bad bodyload which becomes or is all along attached to discomfort being felt mentally.  I used to say that 2C-E had a bad bodyload too, and made me feel weird.  Now though, 2C-E creates a wonderful, warm, almost sexy feeling in me... I find it to have one of the very best body feelings and the potential for truly beautiful states of euphoria.  I haven't had 2C-T-2 since I began figuring out how to better work with materials (2C-T-2 was one of my early chemicals and I only had it 3 times), but I would imagine it's the same sort of thing.  And even back then, once I got past the nausea and come-up, I thought it felt wonderful.

I wanted to take a minute to let everyone know in each of the substance Big and Dandies about the community project of the PD forum which has been being worked on for the past 2 years or so, the Psychedelic Effects Profile survey.  This survey asks you a number of questions, starting with the substance taken, the dose, the method of administration, other substances (non-psychedelic) ingested during the trip, and set and setting, and then it goes on to ask about a variety of specific effects, and you can select whether or not you experienced them and if so, the intensity level of that effect on a 5-point scale.


Thank you for your help with this!  For this to be of any use whatsoever, we need as many responses as we can possibly get, so please take it as many times as you have time for, for as many substances as you have had proper trips on.  We want to gather the full range of effects possible so feel free to take it for positive as well as negative experiences, for earth-shattering and average.  Each time taking the survey is for a single trip on a single substance - no combinations please, as it taints the data for each substance.  In the future I may make another survey for combinations.  The survey takes about 5 minutes to get through so it's not too much of your time.


For further discussion of this project, please see the stickied thread at the top of the forum that starts with "Community Project".  To take the survey, please click on this link: [http://freeonlinesurveys.com/rendersurvey.asp?sid=hvw6fx9mmvzz82l599169](http://freeonlinesurveys.com/rendersurvey.asp?sid=hvw6fx9mmvzz82l599169)

Very interesting and strange. What about other side effects? Comparing to me, my gf is more sensitive to negative effects and less sensitive to positive effects.

Hm, I heared that acid environment is better for absorbtion. That's why vitamin C can help with nausea - there was a thread about it. 

Maybe I misunderstood something.

vitamin c does not help with nausea. in fact, megadose (>1g) of ascorbic acid usually causes gastric upset for people who do not build up a tolerance for the stuff. but sane amounts (50mg) of vitamin c should be completely benign on the body. of course, natural foodstuffs with vitamin c (fresh fruits) can greatly help with nausea due to the water and sugar content along with their delicious flavor.


phenethylamines (and amphetamines) are more easily destroyed in a highly acidic (pH~1) environment like the stomach, however the addition of a vitamin c supplement probably does not change the pH of the stomach very much. i believe that a large part of the reason that phens are 100-150% more effective nasally or rectally is because a portion of an oral dose is destroyed before absorption. does anyone know offhand approximately how much pH-raising power a single TUMS tablet has?


4-sub tryptamines on the other hand appear to be more stable in acidic environment than in a basic one, and most people report that they do not get an increase in potency via the nasal or rectal route compared to oral.

well me and 2 friends today all did 15 mg's orally.  Not nearly as good as i was expecting.  None of us felt sick at all off of it and had absolutely no visuals.  But it did affect my mind in some way and was real anxious and talkative and laughing alot on it so it was still a fun time.   But if i would've done this alone i wouldve been super dissapointed.


Would you guys just recommend a higher dose?  or are there people on here that have done 15 mg and had an actual decent trip?

anyone have any information on re-dosing with 2c-t2?  I have a lot of experience with re-dosing on 2c-e and i find that the body load is much less when you throw more in later.


i am planning on taking this tomorrow over a long period of time and since i dont know the safety of combining other things with it i think i will just add more to it.


also..i am trying to figure out my starting dose. I took 23mg last time in OJ over an hour but dont know if i want to go that route again. could that ROA really have reduced the nausea that much? (i still threw up three times in the first hour)


i know shulgin lists 25mg as the highest but are there people on here that safely take 28? 30? etc?


I would like to go a bit higher up but not so much so that the body load is out of control at first...as i might be outside.... and i also dont need to push it too much. 23 was quite amazing.


any thoughts on this?


thanks

Yeah you can go much higher than 25mg, I've taken 52mgs safely. 10mgs snorted gave me worse nausea than 52 oral but I think rectal is the way to go in prevention of nausea

I had an absolutely incredible time with this compound about 3 weeks ago. It was around a 15-25mg dosage and it was not only an incredible physical sensation from +2 hours to +8 hours but a beautiful mental and emotional state as well.


It actually led to some incredible and genuine psychologically therapeutic breakthroughs for someone close to me. At the same time, we had an enjoyable and "fun" time. This could be used recreationally or therapeutically for introspection in my opinion. 


So far, this is the best compound I've ever tried. There wasn't even a trace of a hangover the next day. I'm going to write up a lengthy (read: boring) trip report very soon but I just wanted to throw my hat in the ring and say I give this two thumbs up.


(FWIW: I felt no nausea and did not puke during come up - my girlfriend vomited everywhere and felt like shit for a solid forty-five minutes during the come-up... so YRMV.)

Has anyone noticed that 2ct2 is far more interesting dosed under the influence of alcohol, or did I just have a great one of a kind trip recently? Normally 2ct2 seems kind of dull with fair amount of energy, but interesting enough.  Last time I did it I was fairly drunk and the trip was as impressive and beneficial as a good mushroom trip.  There wasn't an overwhelming amount of energy and I was content to lay on my bed enjoying drum & bass all night.  It was also the highest dose I've taken nasally which was probably about 10-15 mg.  The body load was more manageable than all other times, despite the fact that I drank 3 tall Olde English cans before taking t2.  Body load has always has been manageable enough, probably cause I realize that there are no drugs in my stomach to throw up since I do it nasally).  I love t2 now and I wonder if it was the alcohol that allowed me to really get into what the substance has to offer.  The only thing about this experience was that I was extremely alarmed at how quick the visuals came on and I felt like I had dosed a very high amount of maoi.  It really caught me off guard and the only thing I could do at first was meditate.  Also I did a shit load of mda the weekend before so perhaps the maoi was like a fresh breath of oxygen for my serotonin receptors, explaining why everything in my room was outrageously bright.

So around 20mg orally is the best starting place for anyone whos not done this before, but has done other 2c-'s before?

2mg orally will probably not produce effects but in the sense that it's a good idea to take an allergy/strange reaction test dose of any new substance, yes, 2mg is a good place to start.  But for a trip it's more like 14mg orally in my opinion.  How much do you take for other 2C-Xs you've tried?

I'd actually maybe start at 16 to 18mg if you're taking those kinds of doses.  My first trip with 2C-T-2 was with 18mg and that was when I had only tried a few psychedelics a few times, and I was glad I took that amount.

This compound has been calling back to me lately. I've only worked with it on 2 occasions, and this was 3 or 4 years ago. It was stellar, though. I was just excited about some other things I was working with at that time, so I didn't give this one my full attention.


But yes. I am going to come back to 2c-t-2 sometime soon. I actually remember it feeling rather organic, though what i mean by that is hard to describe.. 2c-e actually has a mechanical quality to me, if this makes any sense.

Okay so I have only done T-2 once before... it was enjoyable and had some incredible visuals but the body load was HELL!


Does plugging eliminate the body load for the most part? The most annoying things about T-2 were the projectile vomitting (this was worse than on ANY 5-MeO-AMT trip believe it or not - it came in waves and I had to have a bucket handy for dry heaving and tossing up straight water throughout the trip), the high stimulation (not just mentally - CNS was definitely up there), and the headache...


I have an opportunity to get this again... but if plugging doesn't reduce the negative side effects, I won't even bother.


Now I know with tryptamines and other phens, plugging tends to kill off most negative side effects and drastically reduces stimulation of the CNS... is that the case with T-2 as well?

Getting a good amount on friday, wondering what does I should take. 

Is the body load similar to eating 3.5Grams of good nasty mushrooms?

No, for me the bodyload from mushrooms is very different, for me 2C-T-2 produces mild stomach discomfort, but not nearly as bad as mescaline, more of a mildly unpleasant tension. The bodyload as a whole feels more like amphetamine or another stimulant than mushrooms, its tense and my legs tend to cramp quite sporadically. I found smoking a small bit of dried flowers eliminated all discomfort quite easily ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

Dried flowers is the way to go. also, I found that moving around help keep my mind off the slight discomfort as well as took care of the excess of physical energy (riding to critical mass was exhilarating to say the least )

I found my way back to this substance again a few days ago.....been stuck on 2c-i/2c-e so long I forgot how great this one is ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) The body load is minimal for me....just some mild stomach issues as with most 2c's. From a visual standpoint this one is one of my favorite psychedelics........my stovetop(got a drink of apple juice from the fridge and then got lost) was creating a tiny army of fully 3-D cubes and pyramids that would form on the flat surface and then rise up in the air like balloons. I got those kind of results from just 20mg's oral ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) I agree with the statements above about this one being "organic" feeling and 2c-e being more of a "mechanical" feel. The main difference between the two is that 20m'gs of 2c-e would blow my world as well as my ego into millions of machine parts!

well, I'm really digging this thread so ill drop in with some input that most could not give.  I am a huge fan of 2c-t-2 and have had many experiences with it as well as other phens.  with regards to the comparison to 2c-E, I would also say it is significantly less stimulating.  


-I've done 120 mg orally (dissolved in water) and this trip was probably the best I've ever had.  The primary difference for me between this drug and 2C-E is that T-2 has a positive and euphoric push to it, in contrast to the markedly neutral and analytical nature of 2C-E.  It should also be noted that I do seem to have some remarkable resilience to body load of all kinds, as I am aware that most feel nausea at dosages much lower than this.  I, however, attribute this to my pre-trip ritual, which consists of a benadryl or two (phenylephrine; this mitigates the muscle tension and cramping wonderfully, yall should try it!), and lots of water and electrolytes.  also, ginger is phenomenal for the stomach discomfort caused by 2C's. 


 I'd be more than willing to go into more detail with advice for reducing body load, or anything regarding increasing the comfort/getting more out of this chemical.  Feel free to PM me about any specific/personal T-2 questions


happy tripping!

^^^Wow, that is a hefty dose of 2c-t-2!! You are right about the lack of euphoric push to 

2c-e, but it is always hard to say which one is "better" as they are just so different. 2c-e just commands respect in every way, even for people like me who have had many LSD  trips and took it at a very young age.

Have you by chance written up a trip report of the 120 mg experience? I would like to hear more about it. I'll be honest and say that the dose you list is alarming, although I've only ever gone up to around 60 mg or so myself, and that was extremely intense and high on the body load for me. If someone is reading this and trying to figure out a good first time dose to try, please don't start at 120 mg. Way too high to begin with...but with that said, I'd love to read more about your 120 mg experience.

I'd write everything you can down now, even just in scribbles and notes. It will get harder over time I bet...or maybe not. Some people probably frame it mentally over time and can then think and speak better about what they experienced. Either way, I'm eager to hear about it.

just tried this one for the first time last night, and all I can say is wow! Took 25 mg, was expecting a bit stronger version of 2c-e but 2c-t-2 really blew me away. The come up wasnt to bad, and I never had to throw up either, which I thought I would. For 3 hours or so during the peak I was floored, didn't really move at all, just lied on my back starring at the ceiling. Mentally I was extremely fried, I've seen some people describe the mental effects as "dissociating" and I could definitely agree with that. I didnt get any "insights" or "revelations" and actuall found the head space to be counter productive to thinking. Either my thoughts would get stuck in a loop or Id forgotten what I was thinking bout before I could get anywhere with it. Either way was a great time, may try a bit of a lower dose next time but really was impressed with this chemicals strength. 


But I was wondering I noticed on the Pihkal page Shulgin basically says 2c-t-2 was very similar to 2c-t-7, with the distinction being that 2c-t-7 lasted about twice as long. Now really my only complaint about 2c-t-2 was that after the peak ended (t04:00 and onwards) the come down was pretty quick and I was down to only a + by 8 hours in (which is shorter then even 2c-i for me). So people who have taken both, do you agree with shulgins statement or are the 2c-t's all their own monsters?

How would people who have tried both t7 and t2 compare the two?

T7 seems to be a very rich experience, with its bad reputation completely unfounded.  

Is T2 a weaker version of T7, or a compound that has something unique to offer,

if so, what does T2 offer that T7 does not, or what does T7 offer that T2 does not.

The body load for T2 seems to be worse than T7,

the duration of T7 is longer than T2.  

What else can people say about the effects of these compounds?

anyone here tried 2c-t-4? My vendor is the only one I've seen with this compound, and it intrigues me deeply for what I've heard about it bringing repressed childhood memories to life. Could be of great value to me if that's true.


Anyone? Many thanks, sorry for the OT post.

They're both good (and v. similar) but T-7 is the one to go for for sure. Everything 2C-T-2 does well 2C-T-7 does even better; even more visual, more euphoric, more sexual, more of a malleable gentle headspace. Less body load and nausea as well. Top drawer psychedelic, is 2C-T-7.

Ive only really heard good things about t7, ounce i started looking harder.  

as i said before, it seems its bad reputation is just propaganda..

I think im going to just go for the t7 and not the t2.

Im sure there is probably some benefit to t2 over t7,

its just t7 does sound like the one to try if you were going to try one of the two.

i love how in Canada t7 is still legal. or semi legal...sigh,

still available, and not too risky to order, from what i gather.

definetely deserves a top spot on my list, 

but until i get an acurate 0.001 scale, 200$ + and move out,

it will be mushrooms again this month, because tripping time is just around the corner, hehe.

I can safely say after only 5-6 trips on t2 it has earned its place as one of my favorite psychedelics, certainly my favorite PEA. I seriously cant get over how well this chemical treats me everytime I take it. Even just 20 mg of 2c-e will leave me throwing up for 2-3 hours, but Ive never thrown up for this compound, and between t2 and t7 this one is suppose to be worse on the stomache. doses between 15-20 are perfect for some down and dirty introsprection with very nice visuals and insane sensory effects. 25-40 mg, i'm much to high to get any meaningful work done but the introspective disssociated mind states is one of the most unique and entertaining I have ever been a part of. Really a great chemical. Sadly t7 is illegal here in the land of free so its put me off on ordering some but ill get to it eventually. If I had a choice I would much rather have t7 as the twice as long duration sounds like a winner to me, my only complaint of t2 being the abrupt drop off going from +++ at t5 to baseline by t7

tried 2ct2 last night for the first time. 


from what i had read a low dose would be around 8 mg, and that is what i was amining for, a short but expressive taste of what the chem has to offer.


boy was i wrong. i had planned the whole trip to be over in 4 5 hours, at least enough to function in society.

took around 8-10mg (measured 8mg but tha scale sometimes rounds down). 1h in the first effects started to appear.  followed by 2 h of dry heaving and feeling like i am about to vomit (without actually vomiting). the visuals were really innaparent at this point. i jsut wanted it to end.

relaxed a bit with some music, and watching some documentaries. i remember all my feelings (about what i saw/heard) being enhanced, and 4h in i was finally starting to enjoy it somewhat, having renounced any plans for the night and just deciding to ride the wave.

at the 5h mark things got nicer, some nice body tension and increased music appreciation. visuals were ...mild, but in a strong way. how do i put this, they were not really changing teh world but they were very hard to ignore. 

towards the end i just wanted to come down.


im starting to think this 2c is not for me. i will be leaving it for a while, but was wondering if i took a higher dose will the body load be a bit less, or more (as underdosing sometimes does this)? this is probably the worst ive felt under any substance i ever took, and im not one to vomit but the heaving gave me muscle fever....

I'd definitely recommend trying a full dose before you write it off, like ~20mg orally at least. I got pretty bad nausea from 2C-T-2 as well; you could always try plugging or snorting if it really gets to you.

Is it alright for 2C-T-2 solution to have a smell? 


I dissolved 125 mg of it in 12.5 ml of plain water, it was on bicycle day in April. Then in July I dosed 2 ml of this solution and it didn't seem it lost much its potency, but it got some strange smell slightly reminding me of H2S. Yesterday I checked the solution again, the smell was present, but it didn't become stronger.

Because 2C-t-2 has a sulfur atom in it? It's possible the water could've promoted a slight decay, some microorganisms could have eaten some of the solution and metabolized hydrogen sulfide.

Yes, maybe, but I am not sure that the smell is H2S smell. And, did this happen to anybody else?


Also, I thought that PEAs(and particularly 2Cs) are pretty stable compounds even in plain water. 

Also, it this matters, I stored the solution in room temperature and kept it from light.

well i think the alcohol is just put there to prevent bacteria from accumulating, it shouldnt affect the stability. so, correct me if i am wrong, put in some alcohol now to make it safer in the future without affecting it.


anyway, back to my body load question, does the nausea get worse with a bigger dose? if i was dry heaving for hours at 10mg, will i be doing it for 5 at 20mg? ....

Are you fairly new to psychedelics? 


If so it may be more of a psychosomatic reaction than real nausea. I've never vomited from 2ct2 (though I've read about plenty who have) I found myself to move around fairly easy on 20 mgs with a slight discomfort but not really nausea. I tried 50 mgs after that and pretty much didn't move from my bed. It felt 'heavier' than 20 mgs for sure but I didn't really feel like I was going to puke, more just like I had a fever. I can't speak in regards to 10-20 but I guess that you are either  fixated on the nausea or you are really sensitive to this chemical.

Yeah, the nausea isn't real, it is more of hallucination(but if you vomit - you vomit in reality).


Also, I found that nausea from psychedelics doesn't correlate with vomiting. If I vomit, it doesn't depend on how strong the nausea is.

I went through a 500mg sample of this with my partner, and we had a good time with it.  We had a pretty high tolerance from taking 2c-i I think.  It was enough for me to want to get some more, but I didn't really feel like I had a full "trip" from it.  I think we were doing pretty low doses, though.  Trying to decide between this and 4-aco-dipt, though .. i luvs me some 4-aco-dipt. :D

Very interested in this compound.  It seems to vary more wildly than any of the other 2cx's.  I've heard bodyload can be a great feeling all the way to that you can't move out a bed, to puking everywhere.  It seems as though the visuals are pretty much consistently good.

I get not very much bodyload from this compound(and after comeup it is pretty transparent to the body), but no other 2C can make me so nauseous. OEV are quite nice, but nothing special. I remember I get good CEV from my first trip on this chemical. 


The main thing I don't like in 2C-T-2 is its duration. I feel very sick for almost 2 hours, then somewhere at T+1:50 I really start tripping, and at T+4:00 it is already over. Ah, it also gives me the worst headache comparing to other 2Cs.


Also, I am going to try a combo of 2C-T-2 and 2C-E. I think that this combo could be a rare, unique and special combination of all side-effects I ever got from psychedelics ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

**Best Setting for 2ct2**


2ct2 seems to be an introverted experience on higher doses.  I find that its important to be in a safe place where you can meditate and not have to deal with any sort of responsibilities.  Knowing this, every 2ct2 trip has been indoors, and it happens that every trip has been solo.  I am wondering what would be the most impressive setting to really enjoy the visual aspect of the trip.  I'm thinking daytime outdoors maybe, peaking on a nice day at sunset.  What do you all think is the best way to enjoy the visual aspect of the 2ct2 experience?

Snorting probably only increases the side-effects, don't do that. 2C-T-X compounds are especially unwise to insufflate.


Micro-organisms metabolizing into H2S? I kind of doubt it...

Maybe you are just smelling the compound itself that evaporates along with the solvent in minute doses. It being a sulfurous compound it could produce the same smell by lodging into olfactory receptors similarly to other sulfurous substances. Many of them smell like they have something in common, which they do.


Nausea being psychological or fake? Hmm maybe a part of it can be psychosomatic like I experienced with other compounds as well but with 2C-T-7 it felt pretty physical to me. It can easily be tickling of 5-HT3 receptors, someone could find out by taking ondansetron with it I guess.

Well the thing with 2C-T-2 is that it is so visually involving and mentally immersive that it will always be completely fascinating wherever you take it. That said, there is no comparison for taking any psychedelic out in nature, and the further you get away from the inharmonious constructs of human civilization the more healing an experience it becomes. 2C-T-2, being a very entheogenic chemical, is wonderous for healing in Gaia's garden. 


I find 2C-T-2 to be a highly nature-bonding experience, suprising for a synthetic chemical which hasn't been found to be produced naturally. It's important to maximize this aspect of the experience by getting some experience with it amongst the birds and the bees and the trees.

Ha! I reacted the same when I first heard of it, my vote of 'funkiest name for a pharmaceutical' probably goes to ondansetron.


I only have experience with 2C-T-7 of all the 2C-T's (I have four of them), how does T-7 compare or relate to T-2?


Also, I am inclined to call the first time I will be taking T-2 'judgement day' ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

I heared this thing too, I am not sure about insufflation, but I plugged 20 mg of 2C-T-2 with great effects. 

Come up was terrible: my empty stomach was in one big spasm for 15 minutes, and I drinked water only to give some relief and some material for vomiting. Also, there was the worst muscle tremor I ever had. Fortunately, it lasted only 45 minutes instead of almost full two hours of oral 2C-T-2 come up, and the trip was worth it! 

I think about repeating this dose, and I am not sure If I go higher, but if anyone did heroic doses of 2C-T-2, feedback will be much appreciated. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I never thought that it may be the smell of chemical itself. Thank you.

I´ve only tried T-2, but as I understand it, they are VERY similar, except that T-7 has a way longer duration.


T-4 is quite alot different. I find it to be the least interesting phenethylamine I have tried, even though it does have "something" about it, that will probably make me try it again. it´s definitely not recreational though.


Let me guess.....the last one you have is T-21?

I have ondansetron's relative granisetron, and am waiting for the right time to try it with a 2C-X, which always produce nausea for me. 


Although I have no real intention to acquire 2C-T-X, I will post back here on how Granny (Dance-A-Tron's older and less mobile relative) blocks 2C-X nausea in general, for whatever insight it might provide.


As a side note; granisetron comes in a few forms, and presumably the other Trons do as well. Probably the best form for the purpose desired here in this thread is the "dissolution pellet". This form is not a pill designed to be swallowed, but is rather a pellet that is dissolved in freshly boiled water, then cooled to room temperature before drinking the solved granisetron.


My guess is that this enables the Granny to spread out and directly encounter and then antagonize the intestinal 5HT3 receptors rather than be absorbed from the gut to the circulation.

did this stuff aprox. 6-8 times. snorted it every time. the deal is with snorting is that almost every time you will puke, the come up from insufflating is soo rapid its almost instant. some of the greatest visuals ive ever had.

^I've insufflated it a few times but the overpowering burn just isn't worth it for me. It lingers a bit, and ruins the enjoyment of the peak. It also seems to get worse the more times you do it, or it did for me. Also, insufflation never really got me where I wanted to be. Ever since I discovered rectal dosing I never looked back to intranasal; it is particularly effective with 2C-T-2, especially combined with oral doses. I agree that the visuals are stunning with this compound.

At 20 mg oral me and my friend were a bit disappointed with this one. There were alright visuals, some slight trippy thoughts, and a super weird body high. 


I was wondering at what dose does it start to feel more unique. The body high, while interesting, wasn't enough to make it stand out.

Yeah 20mg is probably a tad on the light side. I wouldn't turn such a dose down, but it can definitely go higher. I usually measure out 25mg doses for oral use, similar doses taken rectally are stronger but definitely manageable. Doubling that dose orally is definitely acceptable but the trip will become fully involving. You can redose a couple of hours in with this substance and it blends in beautifully with the first dose, bringing it up to a similar level as it would have if you had taken the doses together. I would say 25mg for a moderate trip, 40-50mg for a fully immersive experience. All in all there's a lot of headroom with 2C-T-2 so it would be good to experiment with different ROAs and varying dosing strategies. The nature of the trip can change in astonishing ways as the dose goes up.

^ I'm not sure going into 40-50mg territory is a good idea.  There's a very steep dose-response curve.


25mg is way stronger than 20.  I forget exactly what my sweet spot with 2C-T-2 was but to my recolection 20-22mg put me in the right spot.


I'd try 25mg before jumping over 30.  25mg can be 2 or 3 times as strong as 20 with some of these things, especially certain 2C's.

It is much more potent. 9-11mg had me tripping extremely hard. Lots of visuals, some paranoia, and sped up mind vibe. Overwhelmed me for the first hour, as I forgot why I had done something like that. It went beyond my expectations. It was my second time snorting an rc. 5-7mg was also pretty intense snorted. 


I've done oral doses between 18mg and 35+?mg. Although only doing a handful of experiments with this chem... maybe 7-8 times it seems that snorting it presents a different trip. Not really sure yet, I haven't found the right dosing for oral yet. My doses were too varied. Snorting it, I think my sweetspot is 6mg. It doesn't overwhelm me, but still gets me feeling very psychedelic. The come-up is terror and nausea, but once that passes in 15minutes you are left with a real nice mellow trip (at 6mg). 


Snorting t2 lasts about 5-6 hours and oral doses generally have lasted upwards to 8 hours for me. Actual trip time doesn't really vary much. With snorting it you come up and come down faster. Oral doses have a gradual come-up over an hour and half and the come-down is about the same is the come-up except you actually feel pleasant. 


Just my experiences. Hope you enjoy yours. Its a pretty nice chemical. Haven't done it in a while. Recently tried t7, which was incredible. I took the perfect dose I think. Good decisions! Been meaning to do t2... Probably not for a few more months though.

Come-up time will be shortened by about 2 hours if you snort, because the oral come-up time is roughly 2-2.5 hours. I have snorted it a few times and it is not a very pleasant way to dose, although it is efficient and hits you hard and quick.


For insufflated doses, use half what you would take for an oral dose. 12mg insufflated for me is a mild-moderate trip, roughly equivalent to 25mg oral, maybe a bit stronger. I would suggest rectal dosing over insufflation. It has the same or higher potency, and the come-up is much nicer. Just try to hold it for long enough until the sensation of needing to take a shit subsides somewhat. It also doesn't burn your face off like insufflating it does. 2C-T-2 is one of the most painful chemicals to snort, it literally feels like it is crawling around my sinuses. Which is why I don't do it that way anymore, ever.

This was absolutely the most worthless compound I've tried. I won't judge it as a worthless compound in general because I know my reaction is not typical, but I found it to be somewhat visual and absolutely *empty* mentally - it was like being sober with a little bit of eyecandy. Very shallow. My dose was 30mg oral. Perhaps some other time I'll take it higher but it's made me very wary to ever buy it again.

I finally got my hands on some 2c-t-2 and I find it to be pretty empty in regards to a mindset, but amazing visuals, incredible outstanding visuals. Course, I've only taken it mixed with 6-apb once and MXE once, but goddamn, so visual, reminded me of a tryptamine. So nauseating though, incredible nausea the entire time both times and I never puked. It's probably my favorite so far of the 2c's out of D, E, I, P, and T-2, but will never take again due to nausea. And forget IM'ing it, I did with 5mg on my 6-apb+T-2 trip and the nausea was 2-3 times as worse as taking it orally.

Great mindset, was VERY excited to finally try this chemical, took it with my boyfriend on a great evening in the privacy of our apartment. Faint nausea persisted throughout the entire trip but it was entirely manageable. I felt that higher doses had the potential to bring out unbearable side effects though... which makes me even more hesitant to purchase it again.

This is a very atypical reaction. Perhaps you should try again, at a higher dose? I've noticed in other threads your general doses for other phenethylamines seem to be quite higher than the norm. For instance, you personally seem to tolerate a 13mg DOC dose well, whereas I wouldn't like to come close to that; 2.5mg of DOC can elicit a +++/++++ experience in me.


Did your boyfriend experience similar effects that you described, or did he have a better experience?


Assuming that you do actually have 2C-T-2, it may have just been one of those anomalous reactions we have from time to time on various substances. My latest experience with 2C-T-2 - 5 days ago - was nothing short of cosmic and life-changing. I will write up a proper trip report, but I'll just sketch an outline of the main points here. Please note, this bullet-pointed list does nothing to even attempt to scratch the surface of coming close to the details and full magnitude of the experience I had. The bullet points are in a roughly linear temporal order of "events":


- My dose was 30mg oral, followed by 7mg oral booster at T+1:30.
- It was somewhat vomity, with *intense* bodily energy.
- Inexplicably breathtaking, complex and beautiful CEVs, fully surround in the internal hyperdimentional space.
- OOBE, completely under my higher will.
- Music in the background warping, going in reverse and skiping and jumping, as if someone was messing around with a turntable and jumping to different points in time constantly. These time reversals and jumps were exactly correlated with what was happening to "me" hyperdimentionally.
- Realization of the Shiva-Shakti creational force of mind.
- Personal apocalypse. Witnessing and the beginning and end of creation, and becoming the timeless point of infinte light and creation. Nirvana.
- Tantric union and near-unity with the Goddess force.
- "Fall" from heaven or nirvana, and the experience of the birth-death of the universe. Being dragged through the akashic records via my own thought and lack of discipline thereof, once again.
- Re-intergration with my individual self in linear time
- Evaporation of "cosmic guilt" via the entrancing beauty of Gaia - trees, sun, clouds. One of the most beautiful and healing sights I have ever known.
- Realization of the eternal now. Realization of the eternal potential of reaching nirvana. Evaporation of anxiety.
- Resolution to become more disciplined with thought, and to take the steps I need this moment to become healthier of mind. Quit a 10-year SSRI addiction (and a 10 year beta-blocker dependence) just like that, immediately.
- I am now a much happier person than I was before the trip.


I also fully respect that you may not subscribe to any of the particularly spiritual aspects of the above. But whether you are secular or spiritually minded, the compound clearly has the potential to catalyze **intense and profound** experiences. This is why I believe that you should give 2C-T-2 another chance, to see if it really was just an anomalous experience you had.

^ Sounds like an incredible trip S.A.!! I have an opportunity to acquire some 2C-T-2 so I was checking this thread. I was already on the positive side, but your experience nails it for me & I placed the order.


I'm quite curious... did you go into this with specific intent? Did you do any pre-trip preparations (ritual, meditation, etc.)? Was this a solo trip? 

Feel free to PM me if you'd rather not reply in thread.

2-ct-2 is awesome, it's just not a "hippy fest" imo.  It's more of a dark trip like DPT or LSA, if that makes any sense.

Yes, I had firstly a conscious intent on further exploring a mild OOB sensation I had experienced a few weeks prior with 2C-T-2. And secondly, I was longing to expose what was happening in my subconscious which was making me so miserable and holding me back from actually living in the true radiance and nirvana of our imminent existence. 


I attempted to prepare for the trip with some meditation and breathing excersises. I used these techniques also after I had purged and hit the surrender stage, and that is where things started to fly.


It was a solo trip, in my bedroom late at night or early morning. My father was downstairs, but did not know I was tripping until I told him of my experience after sun-up.


I am writing a trip report for this, so hopefully it will be up in the Trip Reports section of bluelight soon.

I really like 2ct2, I usually start at about 25mg but I have lifetime tolerance to phenethylamines. How strong it is does seem to vary from experience to experience, as does the amount of bodyload I get. It combines great with 4aco-dmt.

I'll be getting 2C-T-2 for the first time soon...

Has anyone tried taking a single Benadryl (diphenhydramine) beforehand to address bodyload issues?

This has been recommended previously with 2C-E, and it seemed to help me in that case.

^ If it helped with 2C-E it'd probably help with 2C-T-2, but obviously if you find the bodyload with 2C-E less intense in the first place it might not be enough to quell it completely. Definitely worth a shot though ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I say NO to the Benadryl. It did help to a small degree with nausea IME, but it also seemed to cause dysphoria and alter my trips. I no longer pre-dose with Dramamine or Benadryl.

A light dose of 12 mg 2c-t-2 was ingested with a small amount of food in stomach.  Began feeling it within 30 minutes and a modest +++ was achieved within 90 minutes.  Shulgin said it was an "excellent tool for introspection" but I didn't pursue that.  I get a lot of anxiety now days and my first concern was that being amplified by the drug, but it didn't happen.  Anxiety took a hike and the trip was enjoyable.  I tried music, enjoyable.  Porn, everything worked as it should.  Video games, fun.  Food was delicious, no appetite suppression.  I felt no nausea or other GI activities.  I felt no body discomfort.  


A pleasant experience.  I could do 15 or 20 mg next time.

Yeah, I did 18mg last Saturday night and had quite a nice evening. Come up was not bad at all, never got too intense,  I didn't track it, but I would guess maybe 1 to 1.5 hours (last food about 6 hours prior). Smoked a little dank & had maybe 3 beers. The  trip was more body & vision than headfuck. I was totally able to do some good ritual work and stay on task. Sound was enhanced, colors vibrant, etc. Little confusion. Dosed around 10 pm & (tried to) crash about 5 a.m., and actually managed about 6 hours of restless snoozing (probably equivalent to 2 hours of totally sound sleep!). Felt fine in the morning.

What are peoples favourite activities on this one, how does it differ from other 2C-Xs in that respect? (e.g. for me 2C-B is music, art, quiet night in with friends, 2C-E is raves/concerts/parties and writing, 2C-P is for introspection and mind-journeys) 


How's the body load rank compared to those 3? 


Does it have a similar slightly slower to build than other psychedelics tolerance where you can usually dose it/other psychedelics within 24-48 hours without having to take more than like 1.25x the original dose? I'm wondering because it's one of the options for me and my friend's trip this weekend but I'm likely going to a concert later that night and wanted to trip, and don't want to take 2-3x+ more.


Finally, favourite genre of music on this stuff? :D


Thanks!

It's in with the LSD/Mescaline league for me man, top 5 material all the way.


My best trips are between those 3 drugs.  2C-T-2 is like 2C-B in body load and duration but in terms of psychedelia it's the next thing to LSD, with a huge, uplifting rush of euphoria at the peak.  To me, this one's all about lying down at home introspecting, taking mind journeys.

That sounds fantastic, I love both LSD's psychedelia *and* 2C-B's bodyload of course :D


How's it fare in a social environment then? Since I'd be tripping with my friend, rather than laying down at home taking those mind journeys.

It's fantastic in social environments too! It can be a very friendly, outgoing psychedelic if you want it to be, with barrels of laughs to be had. I've been out and about on it many times, you just need to be prepared for the intensity. Expect to be amazed at the depth this compound has, it is truly one of the best. 


2C-T-2 always has that 'magic ingredient' feel to it from me, is if there is an extra dimension which some other psychedelics lack. It has been the compound which has elicited the greatest proportion of ++++ experiences in me.


Body-wise, the body load can be an enourmous body *high* if you are in the right mindset and you surrender to it. You really do feel it in your body, but for me it is like warm healing energy arising in my body and flowing along the meridians. Unlpleasant thoughts make you nauseaus, good vibes feel like you are being massaged by the great cosmic fountain of divine illumination.


About re-dosing, I've found that in the short term (in one sitting), the trip can become even more powerful than the starter dose. Whether this is due to MAOI action or simply that you are already dissolved in the psychedelic mindset in uncertain, but it's true.

Lol just watch out T-2 is certainly amazing but in my mind I had it pegged as more tame atleast a tiny bit so than say E but damn last time I plugged 14ish mgs of T-2 I was blown full tripping balls in 15 minutes past plugging, projectile vomiting. Turned out great besides that unintended puking spree in the beginning half though. T-2 is one of those great psyches for anything you already enjoy doing especially at lower handed levels. Finely tuned but perfect for nearly whatever your doing especially physical since the load can be a bit much at times...!

The scariest time of my life was on 2ct2. I wish I hadnt been such a reckless youth.  My strongest trip with 2ct2 led to incredible insights about myself, overshadowed by the terror that followed after. Sadly much of my memory of that trip has been pathologically blocked from my mind. it causd me to shy away from being a "psychnaut". I attempted a trip report somewhere, god help you if you read that lol. latetly doing mushrooms im almost reminded of 2ct2. unfortuntatly i have never had the pleasure of deeply analyzing these amazing subtances fo various reason. 20to24 mg snorted was MUCH stronger for me than half that amount snorted. I have never orally ingested. I have never puked, though felt some minor nausea. I guess I had a strong body but weak mind. Unfortuntate, what could have streangthened my mind nearly destroyed it.

2c-t-2 was my first 2-xx compound & I was thoroughly impressed, wrote a proper trip report & everything (which is really no like me, I'm too lazy). I'd read alot about this stuff before trying it & was a bit worried about the so-called "body-load". Now don't get me wrong, it's significant, but not unpleasant provided you keep active. So in answer to your question, I like to go walking in the forest or engage in some sort of outdoor activity. I find the feel of the come-up about equals that of 2c-e, which I have puked up on. I've not puked on 2c-t-2, yet. Anyway, we fasted for like 15 hours before dosing, walked thru the park & then spent a very amusing half hour in a CEX seeking games or DVD's or something. It felt usable in a social enviroment, but I dunno about tripping in social enviroments, so I probably wouldn't. Duration also appeared about the same as 2c-e, between 8 & 14 hours total. The t-2 does seem to linger sometimes & the downward slope can last quite some time. After getting home from CEX we carefully ate some toast. Then some more toast. Then scrambled egg. Then we ate loads of fresh fruit, strawberrys etc. We didn't stop fucking eating & I ended up calling the trip report "The Feeding Frenzy" lol


Despite the fact that I'm a DJ, produce my own stuff & play a few instruments, because I like to trip outdoors, we don't often find ourselves listening to music. I think as the weather turns here in the UK I may try 2c-t-2 in the studio, I love creating on shrooms so I'm sure this is worth a try.


For the sake of amusement, the only time we did listen to music on a psychedelic, was after coming back from the park on DOC when we listened to Planet Caravan by Black Sabbath over & over & over again for about 9 fucking hours straight! What a day/night/day that was! ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

I took 8mg rectally this evening, administered over the course of 35-45 minutes. I am happily surprised by how strong this dose is. A few "centre of the universe" moments of inner light breaking through. The peak was quite profound for a dose this low. An ego dissolving experience for sure.


I'm always amazed by the way psychedelics enhance the ability to perceive things in music you hadn't really noticed before. Tonight I noticed a piano part in Happiness by Goldfrapp I hadn't consciously noted before. This is significant for me because I'm a mixing engineer, and the ability to perceive a soundstage with greater awareness and clarity is important for me. I was also listening with the left and right inputs switched round the wrong way on my mixing console. It makes me wonder how much else I miss in music. Besides being just totally awesome to hear music like that anyway which is the main thing!


Considering 2C-T-2 is strong in the 25mg range and upwards (orally) this was a strong trip for 8mg rectal. I think I'm just able to tap in to the headspace at much lower doses nowadays; I can pretty much switch in to a ++ at any time whilst "sober" anyway, so the 2C-T-2 just gave that little extra push to breakthrough. I don't trip anywhere near as often as I used to, but when I do, it's like a huge pressure valve has suddenly been released. The feeling is incredible.

2ct2 is wonderful material, I had some way back in 2009 and enjoyed it very much


It's warm and fuzzy, slightly confusing, and produces quite the boquet of rainbow halos and distortion for me... Much nicer and friendlier than 2c-e. The typical "paradoxical" stimulating/sedating phenethylamine body load is there but it's not unpleasant. (This was at anywhere from 10 to 25mg oral). To draw an analogy 2ct2 is more like mescaline (from what Ive been told) and 2ce is more like LSD.


It also lasts a bit shorter than 2ce, if memory serves.

Totally parallels my experience, except 2C-E being like LSD; found it much more unforgiving, more like mushrooms.  Timing's right, I found 2C-T-2 to be about 5-6 hours and 2C-E to be about 8-10.


2C-T-2 is probably the most similar thing to mescaline I've ever had.  With my limited experience with mescaline and the form I've had it in (extract of unknown, but low-ish dosage), I'd have to say 2C-T-2 has given me better experiences than mescaline.  On psychedelic-equivalency I found ~20-22mg to be near 150-200ug of LSD.  But LSD produces different effects of course; much more sharp and 'piercingly' euphoric.


2C-T-2 is all about that warm, calm empathogenisis, where the body is pleasantly stimulated and relaxed simultaneously, and the mind is in a state of complete contentedness.  If I could live my life in that state I would get absolutely nothing done, and be unable to procure food for sustenance, but, ya know, it'd be nice. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


2C-E never did it for me, it just chewed me out, giving emetic gifts to the porcelain god, waiting for the damn stuff to metabolize, never breaking through the come-up hell.


When I learn how SAR's work, I want to have a good look at what that two-lone pair containing Sulphur atom actually does.  The two compounds are night and day in their effects for me.  I wonder what the Oxygen analogue is like, or going the other way, Selenium?  Pretty sure it stops there though; Well, maybe I'll try some Polonium someday. ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)

Actually I'm amazed at how similar they are to one another whilst at the same time easily being able to tell them apart. The way I differentiate them is that 2C-E is more cerebral, 2C-T-2 is more emotional. The sensorial experience is pretty damn similar though, with slight differences in colour hue/saturation (2C-E lighter, crisper visuals and less warm body feel; 2C-T-2 more saturated, gooey colour tones, with a fluffier and more luxurious body high).


Funny that everyone feels 2C-E is dark and unfriendly. My experiences with it are quite different to that. I have always found it to be euphoric and a very pleasant experience indeed, if a bit egomaniacal and driving at times. It doesn't have the ever-surprising cheekiness of 2C-T-2, nor does it have the lush depth of its sulphurous counterpart - it's a more straight-faced tone of trip for me. But I do like it... 


...though I like 2C-T-2 better, because it brings me to flirting with the skirts of a spiritual ++++ almost every time (either that or a full blown ++++). It just unlocks endless depths of wonder, and is such a rich experience. This one always has been my all-around favourite psychedelic ever since I tried it, and I think it still is.

It does indeed, and that has been a factor in my desire to redose on a number of occasions. The thing with 2C-T-2 though is that the redoses seem to get stronger, and it changes the quality of the trip to something even deeper. With 2C-E, one dose is usually always enough - although I have redosed on it back in the past when my friends and I were doing daily binges.

Yuck, I hated 2C-T-2.  The only psychedelic besides 5-MeO-DiPT that felt so shitty, I just gave up/said why bother.  I gave T2 a good four tries at varying dosages too before I gave up.


2C-T-7 was the golden winner for me.  T2 was mostly a feeling of sickness and some visual effects, but missing all of the warmth and emotional enhancement of 2C-T-7, the depth of 2C-E, or general sexyness of 2C-B.

Was bored and gave in and tried 2C-T-2 (25mg) last night. Surprisingly although it had been 5 days my tolerance was clearly very significant as 95% of the trip I never got past a +, and only had a short ++ on the peak. Fun substance though and definitely want to explore it again in future.


Visuals were nice but very light at this dose. Lots of wavyness and trails, a "ghosting" effect where if I looked at text I could see a second ghost version of it dripping off. I got a similar change in colour hues that I got on 3C-P. Come up was rough but afterwards it felt very soft and smooth, with the tactile sensations being nicer than even MDMA - though it lacked the euphoria to go with it. Think this would be a great psychedelic for sex or just cuddling and opening up emotionally.


Even at this low dose there was some introspection and I dealt with some ways I've been abusing my health lately, and I've put into action ways to change those things, starting this morning ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


Worth noting, if you have a weak stomach, and don't like the idea of vomiting on a trip, this probably isn't one for you. This is the first 2C I've experienced any noticeable nausea from out of 2C-B, 2C-E, 2C-P and 2C-T-2. I have a strong stomach though so I never came close to throwing up (only psychedelic I've thrown up on is aMT) - but if your stomach is weak, you probably would.


Interesting drug and I can see why it's in Shulgin's magical half dozen. Hope I get to try it again without tolerance in the near future.

These comparisons are interesting. I'm quite familiar with oral 2C-T-7 but I haven't had the opportunity to explore 2C-T-2 yet. I have 250 milligrams of the compound in cold storage though, and I would like to test it three or four times before this year is out. While I agree with MGS' assessment here and elsewhere regarding 2C-T-7 (like him, I consider this compound to be one of the greatest psychedelics, natural or synthetic), his opinion on 2C-T-2 seems atypical in relation to what other posters have said here lately (but by no means relative to all the information readily available). Can other members that have used both more than three times each via oral ROA please post a qualitative/experiential comparison of these two substances?

JG, 25mg should have had you tripping your face off, so there was definitely tolerance at play. I would give it a couple of weeks and try again - you haven't seen anything yet! 


I agree with you about the body high being nicer than MDMA. But I disagree about it's predilection for causing nausea. It's just such a deep and expansive psychedelic, and that is the reason people tend to easily become nauseous on it. I've mentioned this before, but it's all about mind (and body) set. The transition to such a different head and body space can be disorienting and if you are caught off guard with defensive thoughts and feelings you will feel nauseous. Just chillax and allow positive loving thoughts and feelings to blossom inside, and I guarantee you will turn nausea in to a bodygasm.


I've gotten nauseous on all manner of psychedelics, and the mechanism is exactly the same in each and every case. I'm not denying the ability of exogenous 5-HT agonists to press the nausea button, but it can be transformed in to something much better when you recognize it. I've had body highs on 2C-T-2 that I can't even come close to describing. Like bathing in pure cosmic energy. Literally like a massage from the angels. I found 4-AcO-DMT more nauseating to be honest, and again the reaction was predominantly psychosomatic.

I haven't, but a friend of mine has tried them both, with more experience with 2C-T-2. He said the visuals were insane, although he may have been comboing it with 5-MeO-MiPT (I'm not sure if he said it was out of his system or not). He was with his brother who was pissing in to a bottle, and he was saying how his dick was becoming one with the bottle and all that. Pretty funny!


I too would like to try the propyl analogue, although it's hard to imagine a more visual version of 2C-T-2.

^ Sadly got no more T-2 to experiment with ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png) Hopefully I'll get some more though, but just had a single dose.


Weird because I'm smoking aMT tonight and it's giving me strong effects at tiny doses. Maybe the T-2 was just a bad batch or something? Me and my friend haven't had problems with any of this guy's stuff before but everyone makes mistakes.


My other theory is that my friend's scale was off at the time.


I dunno, I was pretty chilled and happy the whole time I just got stomach ache and nausea. It wasn't bad mind you, I never get very nauseous on most drugs, and I agree that it's mostly mind over body when it comes to it.. but in 40 something trips even the worst of my 2C-E bodyloads didn't quite reach that level. (For me that level was still very mild and easy to handle, but like I said, I have a very strong stomach, so I could see it being rough for someone else. E.g. 2C-P causes no bodyload for me but causes all my friends to projectile vomit ![:p](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png))

I've tested oral 2C-T-7 at 12mg (which was combined with 18mg of 4-AcO-DMT an hour and a half later), 25mg, 30mg (on four occasions) and 35mg. At 25mg, the OEV's were strong; at 30mg, OEV's were very strong indeed; at 35mg, OEV's were extremely strong, at times literally blinding me in a complex ocean of colored light. As you can imagine, at these three dosages (but particularly at 30mg and 35mg), CEV's were truly magnificent, perhaps the most spectacularly beautiful I've ever "seen" (if not necessarily the most "meaningful" or "cosmic"). For me, it's hard to imagine a more visual version of 2C-T-7. There are many other remarkable things that I could mention regarding this substance, but that is beyond the scope of this thread. I'll test 2C-T-2 during November and/or December and return with some observations. Thanks for the input, SA!

Man that sucks you have no more..  BUT, if you ever find yourself on a break from psychs, this is a good one to return to.  I'm sure you know all about how the best and deepest trips happen when you haven't tripped in a long time.  Next time you take 2C-T-2 try to make it one of those experiences.

You don't have to mega-dose it; I have a feeling that would just make the come-up harder and bring an element of undesired dopamine/norepi-type stimulation.  Anything from 18-25mg depending on your hard-headedness should do the trick.  The low 20s is the highest I'll go.


I agree with SA on the matters of this one being very capable of bring in the ++++, and if not, the +++ is very euphoric in the body, much like MDMA but on a calmer level. It's actually on a much higher level when you really sink into that state.  The tactile sensations on T-2 were superior to those produced from MDMA, IME.  The Somatic-Psychological connections I've had on T-2 are the best I've ever felt from any psychedelic.

And yeah, the nausea is all in the mind.  I've also had 4-AcO-DMT give me much worse nausea than 2C-T-2.  I know it's the same case for 2C-E.  Like I said; 2C-E has given me some of the most somatically painful experiences I've ever had, but I know it's just because it's a strong psychedelic and I never broke through the barrier with it.


Out of the few ++++'s I've had, the two time I took T-2, I reached a state, something above a +++.  I don't know how to describe it; I'll be lying there enjoying the calm somatic sensations, and all of a sudden I'll come back from somewhere, with a gap in my time continuum, knowing I just came from some heavenly place, but without the hard memory of it.

It's like the conscious mind isn't capable of holding onto the memory of that.  That's my experience of ++++'s anyway.

I've done low dose oral (gel-capped) 2C-T-2 at a Renaissance Faire and at a Gov't Mule concert. 12mg was lot's of fun at the Ren Faire, not at all overwhelming, I was able to hold a conversation with friends & family. No one had a clue that I was tripping. I had eaten breakfast (nothing else later except beer), dosed about noon, and was back at baseline by 7 pm.


12mg was just OK at the concert; due to the noise, dancing, etc. I could have used a bit more... but I'm glad that I didn't as my ride wanted to cut out early & I eventually had to drive. I had dosed around 7:30 pm and drove around 1 am. It took more concentration than usual but I was fine. If I had dosed higher I would have ended up staying in my car for a while. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

PepperSocks, just from the light experience I had I can tell it's one I want to return to with no tolerance when I next come across it. It had something really unique about it, and it's the extremely unique psychedelics like 2C-B, 2C-E and aMT that have given me the most interesting experiences.

Even when I was +/++ I can agree with that, even at that level touch felt much better than on MDMA and I thought it was placebo at the time but I had a shower on the come up and touch felt incredible. Then as the substance peaked I finally realised it was the drug doing that after all.


pontifex01 as I said in my posts I found it very light at the dosage I took - obviously that was largely due to tolerance and going by experiences I've read, my level of experience was something more like the 10-12mg range. I think something like 15mg or so would be a nice level if you just want a light fun trip. That's just speculation though but I'm sure others will confirm a good dose range - it'd certainly serve the purpose imo though ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I went into 2c-t-2 expecting it was going to be super hard on my body and very analytical and introspective and had the opposite reaction. My first active bioassay was at 22mgs and it wasn't very impressive but at 30mgs+ is where the uniqueness comes through and it's very much a blissed out hedonic buzz for me. And yes. The tactile is fucking incredible. Would love to do this stuff with a sexy cuddle buddy.


2c-p though was VERY introspective and analytical. At a point I caught up in some negative/insecurity thoughtloops.

I was planning on doing 15mg as a first time dose this saturday, is this a sensible first time dose? I don't have too much of this niche chemical to titrate upwards slowly that much. I'm going to be tripping with an experienced person who's only psychedelic experience outside of mdma (of you choose to count it) is 20mg 2c-b which they said was underwhelming. Would it be an appropriate dose for someone inexperienced? We're aiming for museum dose level methinks.

I have plans to do a solo mission in my new place with mostly nothing but limited decor, music, a laptop, a pen, pad and my mind. My only concern is I like being outdoors(nature), but I am in a city where I know no one well enough to chill with, nor a safe locale. I'm fine with being alone with my head, I've done it many times. Just never with these RC's. Any thoughts?

Yeah should be fine. The "RC" name is really meaningless and arbitrary. Essentially it depends on your mental preparedness, dosage and the nature of the chemical, a well as your surroundings. Don't take a crazy high dose. And good friends around are always rad. But solo trips can be cool.

Did you write this?  It's really good, explained a lot in a short amount of time.


Whoever wrote it, I know that feeling....especially the analytical mindset mentioned, and the safe place with 2C-T-2.  It was also 'sharper', less emotional but not lacking it...just less likely to inspire one to get on his knees and thank the Earth, or God, or choose your flavor...as I have seen with a few people including myself on 2C-T-7.


Unfortunately for me, whether it was my 'set' at the time, and/or lack of understanding of how to be at one with your body...which is handy for dealing with 'body load' and the need to purge but it's not the right moment..T2 just didn't seem to jive with me.  Pretty sure I gave it all away so I doubt I'll get to reassess it..  Anyways, the profound nausea was really bad with 2C-T-2...there was always a really good trip underneath it all, but whether 14mg, or whatever I took last time...on up to 30mg in my early trials....I at least once said 'never again' and by trial 4 that stuck.

I did, but none of the experience is mine.  Rather, it's the summation of my notes from interviewing the person (an industry chemist) who came to me asking for a sitter for their experience.


Thanks for the compliment.  2C-T-2 was a favourite among my old friends back in the day.  I saw it induce a single ++++ experience, and heard positive results from many others.  Unfortunately it's a material I never got to enjoy; maybe some day, time and availability affording.  2C-T-7 I have also never encountered, but it always sounded like an interesting compound.

It was supposed to last forever but oh well I tripped ALOT at high dosages (i was a lot younger and loved trippin') and spread it around my community/shared with brothers. I still had about 500mgs at the end but my youngest brother stole it Lol.


As far as dose goes usually i would take 20-30 intranasaly followed by more bumps throughout the night/day to keep that full head of psychedelic steam going. Besides my brother no one else could handle doses like that though, or no one wanted too ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

Here's a warning about 2c-t-2:


A friend and I took 10mg intranasally last weekend. Within minutes she was feeling strange and by 10 minutes she was throwing up constantly and having effects that she described later as the intensity of a DMT breakthrough but constant and unrelenting. Meanwhile I was experiencing the expected mild to moderate effects. 


She's ok and we ended up having an amazing weekend but be aware that ideosycratic reactions can occur on this compound. I imagine that if we had taken the 20mg we were originally planning, there would have been a hospital visit.

Yes my best friend had a similar reaction to snorted 2C-T-2 (which my friend believed to be 2C-T-21 at the time due to being informed, supplied and guided by a dyslexic and quaint individual). IMO people should not insufflate 2C-T-X compounds - it does not seem to agree with the metabolism corresponding to enteral vs. parenteral administration (at least that is what I infer).

Glad everyone's okay.

Bizarrely she can snort 15mg of 2c-b without a single complaint. 


I find insufflation and rectal administration to be the best ways to take the 2-c compounds because it completely avoids associated diarrhoea. I also find snorting is the most convenient way to titrate dose. I was fine with 15mg 2c-t-2 intranasally. 


I'm re-reading PiHKAL and there's a chapter about how variable Aleph-2 was between different individuals. I guess the same is true of it's 2 carbon homologue.

I'm not sure that you can compare 2C-halo's like 2C-B with 2C-T's, I've also insufflated 2C-B and 2C-C and only found the caustic nature in my nose and consequent pain a problem. With something like insufflating 2C-E and 2C-P I would advise caution regarding intensity and with 2C-P additionally the potency (you really visit single digit mg dosage territory of a seemingly unforgiving compound). But 2C-T's seem different. 

I never dared snorting any but read of and heard of so many adverse and potentially dangerous reactions that I consider it foolish to do anything like insufflation, injection or reckless combination with them. They are the main ones to potentially cause critical serotonergic effects, delerium, significant GI disturbance and death. There are a few possible explanation for that, but until we fully understand it... enough to deal with it accordingly, isn't it short-sighted to tempt fate for reasons that are hardly if ever convincing. 

I'd like to check the literature on metabolism differences to see if there are any indications on why thio's might be different..

I insufflated a large dose of 2C-T-2 once, about 20 mg.  I could see how this could be lethal in a large amount, because I could feel a feeling of "too much" if it was stronger.  But on the level I was at, that feeling was good.


The first time I did 2C-T-2 I got some strange visuals.  Black vibrations, black and green swirls in the edges of my vision, thought I saw bugs a few times that weren't there.  Hands felt like they were buzzing.  Then I got home and played some Halo: Reach and the broken debris and rock on the title screen looked like an infinitely complex space station with red and blue colors running throughout it.  It was a strange, nonmoving visual.  It remained still and profound, and as I looked closer it grew in complexity.  Surely haven't had such visuals from anything else.

My first experience on 2c-t-2 a few weeks ago (15mg intranasal with 5mg supplement after 2 hours) was one of the most magical psychedelic experiences I've ever had). And it was only a ++ with a 10 minute foray into +++ territory.

Nope, it isn't... & I'm not suggesting it is. I'm using correlation to suggest that because 2c-t-**7** has caused intense effects & health problems particularly when snorted, it might not be too surprising if a related compound such as 2c-t-**2** brought at least some of the same effects when use through the same roa... 


Other 2c's have also been used in a similar, comparative context further up.

The point I'm making is that I'm not sure you can extrapolate 2c-t-7's effects to explain the action of 2c-t-2 any more than you can extrapolate 2c-e's.


Mind you Solipsis thinks you can and he probably knows more about SAR than me.

I've tried 2c-t-2 a couple of times and found it completely uneventful and utterly boring. Didn't do anything for me. Second time I tried it, I made a short note afterwards thinking it was the first time I had tried it, only to find out I had actually tried it before, which I'd forgotten about, and my experiences were very similar. Not interesting at all.

But you can.... Just like the effects profiles of all the 2c's are fairly similar compared to other psychedelics, the 2c-t-x's appear to be a subgroup of this drug effect generality. Same with the NBOMes.

2C-T-21 is also kinda iffy, and that is basically 2C-T-EF - a fluorine atom away from 2C-T-2. (By that I mean there has been at least one death and others have gotten nasty side-effects when used appropriately, I can attest to that).

Even if we can't extrapolate here, and strictly speaking we of course don't know anything for sure, IMO the compounds are related enough to make it smart to err on the side of caution.

It's possible some 2C-T-X are tricky simply because they interact with certain receptors the simple halo's and alkyls do not, but it is also possible and IMO more probable that there are additional metabolic effects because the thio is a different sort of group that is probably more prone to certain chemical / metabolic modifications. Whatever it is, snorting bypasses first-pass metabolism and also makes for a sudden and dramatic peak plasma level and neither seem advisable with a drug that - if anything - has a side-effect profile that could be problematic when exacerbated, not to mention potentially dangerous.

It's IMO possible for example that these 2C-T-X drugs are a pro-drug of types, and active metabolites play a role in the effects while the drug itself is also active but more intense and more dangerous. As long as you don't impair that partial metabolism or cause the levels to go too high, the unmetabolized levels might not be toxic. I think that would be a good explanation and I'm interested in your feedback on it. It would be similar to MDMA and metabolism to the more psychedelic MDA only in that case the metabolite is the more active one in terms of psychedelia and side-effects, and neither are quite as dangerous.


But yeah 2C-T-7 probably does take the cake.

It seems like bad HR to downplay the dangerous potential of 2C-T-2 because it is not as extreme as 2C-T-7, just because we are not clear on which one of the mechanisms is being a problem here.

We've had fatalities from insufflated 2c-e in recent years too, though I suspect these may have been excessive dosing by idiots, like 100mg lines kinda thing. But the point I believe stands, for the sake of HR & in the spirit of the preservation of valuable life, it would be wise to snort 2c's at only the most modest of doses, should one choose to do so. 


It hurts like fuck so I personally would not Lol

It was 60-65 mg actually still that's rediculous since you were already on 1mg or so of LSD. I think we used to trip to much ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

My findings copied from the social thread:


> I liked the 2C-T-2 but I didn't love it like I did 2C-T-7. Also I got GI issues for quite some time, including two unusually painful dryheaving sessions. A buddy recommended a warm shower and that helped a lot. I had the strongest CEV imagery there, it was really unique. Very detailed fractalized images mixed with hallucinations of flowing quicksilver type textures and memories of intercourse with women in the past.
> 
> 
> 
> After my first attempt at throwing up (my stomach was empty - a banana had probably already moved on), I got a sudden rise in effects which is kind of typical I guess. Everything looked very warm, colorful, and bold. There was some writhing on the couch as well. After I had that shower, I applied some body milk since it was my third shower of the day - I had had a martial arts training session in the morning which also seemed like a perfect preparation body energy wise. The skin sensations were kind of weird, but actually really liked being so aware of my physique. For me it was pretty recreational, I did not feel like I had to do therapeutic work on myself... perhaps because I feel very good about my life now, and am used to feelings of openness and peace.
> 
> 
> 
> It was a good day to be alive, that is for sure. I might try 2C-T-4 but unless I simply don't have the time for it, will probably go for 2C-T-7 again in the future, if choosing from any of the 2C-T's. 2C-T-21 doesn't really count as a normally versatile psychedelic in my book though it may be good for other things. I was not that impressed with it, but who knows it could be an enhancer or nootropic-like for some activities or situations. A downside of 2C-T-7 by the way seems the unpredictable dose-response relationship... but IMO all downsides of 2C-T-7 are more than worth it.

I'm sad to have only had the opportunity to try this once.

Unfortunately I have no info on dose, but seemed like a small amount from effects.

Snorted it (only 2c I've insufflated), was exquisitely painful, watering of my eyes resolved into rainbow halos and distortions.  

Spent a good amount of time fascinated by textures of bedclothes, radiator, curtains etc.

Felt peaceful, open, grounded, fantastic.  I think I was gradually entering a calm meditative state that could have been very 'productive' but friends turned up unannounced.  Had a very pleasant couple of hours talking peacefully - totally able to participate, but occasionally challenged by a mild surge of annoyance that I was having to be 'present'.

Could be used for social interaction or private thinking/being.

I'd love to visit again, and it's made me intensely curious about the t7 that a friend of mine has.  He's a bit wary after reading horror stories unfortunately so might be a tricky thing to approach!

I'd like some input from other experienced 2C-T-2 users.


I've tried this twice now, once at ~5mg, and then at ~12mg. I'm really intrigued by this compound for a bunch of reasons (it's close to 2C-E, which I love, it's one of Shulgin's magical half dozen, reports seem to show it a bit on the serious side which appeals to me), and I want to like it more than I did with my two trials. I definitely liked it both times, but I wouldn't say I loved it. I didn't have any particular body-load problems that you read about. It just didn't seem special in any way, kind of like how I feel about 2C-B, a bit neither here nor there, wishy washy or something.


So what I'm wondering is, have I overlooked something about it? Maybe my set and setting made me overlook a gem? I'm wondering how other's feel about it, trying to figure out if I should give 2C-T-2 more of a chance, or accept that maybe it's just not the right key for me.


What is it that you like or dislike about 2C-T-2? What are the best ways you've found to use 2C-T-2?

I found it to be by far the most effective when listening to music, laying down with my eyes closed.  It seemed to really facilitate an experience, multiple times, where my ego/personality split into multiple component parts and I was left as the observer, watching and learning from how the other parts interacted.  I found it greatly therapeutic at the time, as I used it (successfully) to get over some lingering depression and anxiety related to recent life changes.  Post-peak, it left me feeling wonderful and contemplative and I reveled in some time spent outdoors.

For me, 2C-T-2 is 2C-T-7 lite; T-2 possesses essentially all of T-7's best qualities, but they are toned down considerably. It does yield beautiful visuals, though... I like T-2 visuals more than those of any other 2C-x. My preferred dosage range for this compound is 20-25mg (oral). You should consider taking more than 12mg the next time that you try it.

I've found that all 2C 's tend to present very differently at low levels versus higher (not 'heroic') levels, and that it takes a sufficient dose to really get to know them. I like 2C-T2 a lot, but my low level attempts have been disappointing.  In fact, I enjoy low level trypts but not so much with phens.

Heaven/Hell: An Experience with 2C-T-2 & Cannabis (ID 33667)". Erowid.org. Jul 20, 2004. erowid.org/exp/33667

DOSE: T+ 0:00	18 mg	oral	2C-T-2	(powder / crystals)

repeated	smoked	Cannabis	(plant material)

T+ 2:00	3.0 mg	insufflated	2C-T-2	(powder / crystals)

T+ 11:15	repeated	oral	Alcohol	(liquid)

T+ 25:00	13 mg	insufflated	2C-T-2	(powder / crystals)

repeated	smoked	Cannabis	(plant material)

T+ 30:45	repeated	oral	Alcohol	(liquid)


BODY WEIGHT:	140 lb


I want to start off by saying me and a close friend, I will call Z studied this drug for weeks before use. I purchased 100mg of 2c-t-2 from a reliable supplier. Listen everybody I know its dumb so I dont wanna hear shit about me not using a scale peroid. I broke the 100 mg into 5 piles. I capped up two that were roughly 18mg and me and a friend were gonna take em that night (friday).


Heaven 18mg + 3mg insullfated


T 9:45pm- we both ingested the capsules at 9:45. We like we always do smoked weed throughout the entire experience, hoping to enhance the psychedelic effects.

T 10:45- SLIGHT euphoria, muscle clenching, urges to grind my teeth, its a little uncomfortable. SO far this drug feels like a bunk roll, nothing special. me and Z watch more tv

T 11:45- Same feelings just a little more pronounced, me and Z decide to take a 3mg bump to put us where we wanna be. I get a little nausious and decide to puke. Within 5 minutes my vision starts swaying back and fourth. Its like everything came alive. My body buzz had doubled, feels like a decent roll now. The ceiling was moving aroung morphing into each other, the carpet is swaying back and fourth. Everything had this clear psychedelic entity around it, my walls were breathing, posters were moving up and down left and right. Colors were just jumping out everywhere, vines were growing all over, neon colors over everything. These hallucinations are more vivid that ANY other hallucinations I have ever recieved. This blows my 6g shroom trip put of the water, and these were BOMB ass shrooms, 2g and your tripping balls almost too hard.


This is the most psychedelic experience ive had so far.. The best part is I can think clearly, When I take shrooms I get the 'mindfuck' which makes it hard to talk and fallow conversations. Not this drug I felt completely clear minded its awesome.

T 2:00 We have peaked already. The visuals are still there just as pronounced as before, same with body buzz. Ok heres the part NO ONE ever talks about w/ this drug. The Muscle tension, clamping, and teeth grinding. It is VERY annoying and slightly uncomfortable. but well worth the trip. We put in Fear and Loathing. Holy shit, This movie is THE BOMB for this drug. We felt like we were in the movie, I felt like Hunter S. did throughout the whole movie. We smoke weed crack jokes and watch this movie until its over.

T4:00 The body buzz is back to what I felt at like at 10:30 visuals have subsided, now only slight morphing, melting, and wall breathing. I remember telling Z that I wouldnt sell this feeling for a thousand dollars,lol. Me and Z stay up talk and smoke pot all night


T8:30am- Drug is almost completely gone, but I am sensative to these types of drugs (PEA) and I cant sleep. So I start drinking beer and wine, while smoking green. Within a half hour I was knocked out.


I mean to tell the truth. This is the best drug, well psychedelic that is, that I have ever experienced. The hallucinations so vivid I could sit there w/ pen and paper and draw my hallucinations. I am definately gonna buy more of this.


Ok heres My BAD TRIP report.


Hell ! Everything goes wrong at once !!!!!!!!! 12-15mg insullfated


T 10:45pm - Me and z break out our lines after smoking a few bong bowls, to ease nausia. I do mine up two nostrils. AHHHHAHAHAHA! It fucking burns like no other. I expected this but god damn. Ok bear with me I am going to do alot of writing. I'm just trying to explain the AGONIZING DISPHORIC feeling of 2ct-2 insullfated. within SECONDS I was tripping harder than I have ever in my life. Me and Z are both VIOLENTLY ILL. The cramps, muscle tension, and teeth clenching all hit me at once, AGONIZINGLY INTENSE. This def. was uncomforable and NOT fun. Still I am hallucinating like crazy the entire room is moving, Same visuals I had last night just 10x as intense. The room moving so much is making me more sick. The walls are breathing, patterns, swirls, vines growing are so distinct, its jaw dropping. And the auditory hallucinations were out of this world. Everything sounds metallic, sounds were bouncing off each other. SO MUCH noise in a completely quiet room. It was like in the movies when they try to portray tripping, whenever someone talked it echoed 10 times.


What did I do to myself! It would repeat like 5 times. So when all these things are making noise, the noise would make more and more and more I was going crazy. Anyway back to the shitty part. To go w/ all the body problems my heart is racing at least 120bpm, out of control. I feel like im having a heart attack !!! It becomes hard for me to breath!! BTW Z is feeling the EXACT same feeling I am. We are both having panic atteacks, taking turns going into the bathroom, getting violenly ill, Projectile vomit !!! There was puke EVERYWHERE!!! We were both having such vivid hallucinations we couldnt tell what was puke and what wasnt. I just grabbed a towel and started wiping everything like my life depended on it. it looked like the exorcist was in there. My parents would have flipped. BEAR IN MIND ALL THESE FEELINGS ARE HAPPENING ALL AT ONCE! I was scared for my life. All I could think was what have I done to myself. I feel like I poisoned myself! I kept thinking I was going to die. I looked terrible, we both did.


I know for a fact if anyone would have witnessed what was goin on (mom,dad,hell even a friend) they would have immediately called 911. I wanted to so bad but I knew they couldnt do anything but knock me out, and id get in mass trouble. ME and Z were laying in bed in agonizing pain (unbearable muscle tension, teeth) We just decided to wait it out. If I was still feeling like this in a couple hours I'm calling 911. I knew by how fast it hit us it would be gone just as fast. The only way I can describe it as everything going wrong all at once! I was tripping too Hard, This feels like a psychedelic crack rock, no joke, like I injected the drug.


T12:30 a.m -We are calming down visuals have subsided to the awesome visuals we had the night before, def. not as intense as b4. now I feel like I did at 1:00 a.m. the night before. Good body buzz and visuals audio hallucinations are almost gone. The intensity our bodies had a hour before was gone. I was a little too traumatized to enjoy this any time soon. I was still nervous. Me and Z stay up until 2:30 talking about how fucked up we were and what was happening to us. I blacked out most of the experience of what happened until we talked about it. I couldnt remember what happend just that I was deathly sick and something was very wrong. Eventually after talkin about it was all coming back. We smoke 3 joints right in a row, this calmed me down greatly.


T2:30 My friend is worn out and he gets some sleep. Like I said I have a hard time sleeping on drugs w/ amphetamine like qualities. I stay up and enjoy the rest of the drug before I sleep. This actually feels fun now. I watch TV intill 4:30 then take some shots and pass out.


I cant believe people insullfate this drug, and do as much or more as I did and actually enjoy it. I just dont see anyway possible. THIS DRUG WAS NOT MEANT TO BE SNORTED! please take my word. I feel that I took anymore I might have died. Im SO suprised in the intensity of the drug just by differents routs of administration. I would imagine I.V. wouldnt feel much different. The bad effects lasted for 1 1/2 hours ( to fucked up for my liking). I will definately stick to oral. I think that if anyone I know took this drug the way we did they would have freaked out and went to the hospital. I know that I didnt go because I have tripped HARD b4 and I just wanted to wait it out.


I am posting this to warn people that decide to take T2. I dont care what everyone says, I just want it in the search engine for safety purposes. My friend is goin to post tomarrow about his psychedelic experince when sniffing it. But all I can tell you we both felt exactly the same ! this just wasnt some type of reaction.

Thank you all

Thanks for your advise guys, sounds like I need to take the dose up to give it a fair shake! Next trial will be around 20mg, maybe a little bit more. I definitely won't be snorting it.

My favorite dose was 22mg.  I haven't tried it in a long time though, it was actually one of my early psychedelic experiences.  I went through 100mg and have never had more.

My favorite dose is 22mg as well. Alright, star, you said 20mg. That should be much better than before, but don't hesitate too much about going for 22mg. That's where the sweetness is for Xorkoth and me. I'm looking forward to your future observations. Have fun. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

What's the legality of t-2 and t-7 in the US and elsewhere? I've been reading about these two for years and can honestly say that besides mescaline, they're the only two I really have an urge to seek out.

2C-T-2 and 2C-T-7 are both schedule 1 in the US. I happen to be from Canada, where neither are scheduled as far as I know. I looked up their legality last year before making a purchase. 2C-T-2 was the first research chemical I had ever done, back in 1998 so it's always had a special place in my heart.

Well it turns out that after scraping my baggie out I have exactly 22mg left (plus a 5mg gelcap I set aside earlier). I'll take that as a sign! It's going to be a little while till I get around to dosing this, but the 22mg is waiting for me when I'm ready. I think it should be a pretty immersive trip.


What do you guys do with your empty scraped out baggies btw? I think the options are:

-throw it out because there's no way to measure what's left

-dissolve the last bits out with some water, and take guess how much there is, or titrate it up. 


I'm guessing there's at most 3mg left in there.

I've done a lot of this and always liked it. It has always been a very positive experience. Very grounded, rational, centred and directable.  I can't be very sensitive; I seem to need a good 30mg to really get the full benefit and would possibly go higher. Once you find a dose that works it really is special though; it bridges that empathogen-psychedelic gap really well. Not had anything really cosmic off it - for me it's not been like that - just deeply sensual in the here and now. As I said very good to direct into activity or sensory enjoyment. The 'bodyload' you learn and gets easier each time. Indeed I agree it can be an immense bodyhigh. I think there is almost a misperception about the bodyload. For me it's almost an honest robustness, a firmness or fine solid feeling. I find it easier than the bodyload off many PEAs 2c-e much worse for example and whilst interestingly odd lacks the soul of 2C-T-2


2C-D is one of my favourites and 2C-B. But this has a real something; a bit deeper,grown up, more elegant or majestic than those perhaps. Wonderful

Glad 2CT-2 is still attracting interest. Debate will never stop but for me one of the (few)finest PEAs

2C-T-2 has got to be my favourite out of the T-X's I've tried (T-2/4/7) The only issue I found with it, is kinda what Sir Ron Pib was talking about, and that was finding the "optimal" dosage for it. Mine fell in the range of around 25-27mg's. I've had some interesting experiences with this substance, but it feels to not... really be as wild as say T-7, the results are /usually/ not unexpected and fall within a spectrum of sorts. 


It's a marvelous substance, I'm glad it's still getting the love it deserves. It's probably in my top 5, and probably one or two on the list that I've done the most out of the Phen class. (T-2 or 2C-B, it's a coin toss for which I've done more of, and also depending on how I was feeling on that particular day which one got picked) I might even go as far to say that it's my favourite psychedelic period, yet you can't really just pick one now can you? ![:p](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)

Does  plugging t2 posses allot more danger compared to oral dosing like nasal does? I'd really prefer the shorter come up since I get less anxiety when the peak hits quickly. The times I did it orally I did 20mgs which was a perfect dose that gave me a full  immersive trip but wasn't overwhelming to the point I was uncomfortable. Well the  first time when I got extreamly sick on the come but was fine on the peak. I'm thinking of starting by plugging 7-10mgs since I haven't dosed it that way before.


2ct2 has  always been one of my favorites. Love how it has the perfect balance of empathogenic and psychedelic effects.

Can't pick one, and why would we because we don't think like that. do we%) I really want to push the dose on this especially since I don't seem to get nausea and I really think about this compound .  The dose for this seems to vary , and it comes down to finding your dose. I never really had much bodyload either, slight at the most and that was towards the end. 


Is 2c-t-2 hard to synth? It seems rare and I am interested in what the chemist minded here think about how difficult this compound is to synth. Do you think there is the variance in quality from different labs such as the case with MXE?

21mg was fun/euphoric with good visuals. The headspace reminded me of LSD in the way that you can analyze things really well while you're still lucid. The CEVs were cool, but nothing to write home about, though they were definitely better than the dull C or B visuals.

I want to try a higher dosage, but the muscle tremors and clenching holds me back. A bit of xanax eased that, but that takes away from the rest of the trip too.

Fun trip overall. About 4-5 hours for the most part.

If you enjoyed the god-awful body load of 2C-T-2, then you'll love the effects when you IV even 3mg of it. Big wave of nausea + raw phenethylamine feeling body load and boring sub-tripping headspace at that dosage, but I wouldn't want to push it higher.

Bump for prune.  This is one of my favorites!  I had an early impactful experience on it which helped me to regain self-love and kick myself out of a depression.  I actually do have about 200mg of it which I will try again some day.

Maybe I'm an anomaly here with regards to this issue, however I have been able to work friends through bodyload issues by talking to them and getting them to focus the intense body energy into a truely healing chakra cycle.

> I have to say, this is just about as wonderful as a psychedelic can get. Once you get the hang of it, you would know exactly what I mean. Let me try to explain: many people get hang-ups on body-load issues with psychedelics, and can't get past them for the whole trip making it a shitty experience from their perspective. Whilst some psychedelics (such as 5-meo-amt) can manifest very unpleasant symptoms which are clearly poisonous, others such as 2c-t-2 create an intense synaesthetic psychedelia involing both the body and the mind; in most cases, people aren't prepared to let the process flow and so they create the cramps. nausea, vomiting etc. in order to deal with these energies; they are essentially fuelled by a feedback of negative associations and energy imbalances. The point is this: because of the intense synaesthesia, and interplexing between body and mind on 2c-t-2 (and other psychedelics similar to it) there is an absolute opportunity to go the other way, back up the spiral. If you stop resisting the energy flows, and instead let them become at the front of your awareness with all other aspects of the experience, they will naturally fall into a rythmic pattern of chakra energy flow - which becomes an full out massage. (don't be embarassed to let yourself go in the company of others... this is often what fucks it up).
> 
> 
> 
> So instead of cramping up and worrying about the next time you'll vomit, instead you are now in a state of outrageous bliss from the exotic energies discarded and absorbed all over body, through your chakra points like a complete 'chakra shower'. This is all intertwined with your setting; the synaethsia will just keep feeding back in and out of this system, making the whole experience one of the most sensational, visually rich, bodily cleansing, and psychedelicly sumptuous there is. It really does give you the opportunity to let yourself fall back into the natural harmony and rythym of nature. ![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif)

Eh

Anyone notice this go clumpy/flaky over time?


I got it years ago and kept doses in small epindorph tubes in a mason jar filled with other tubes/rice, no desiccant. Kept at room temp usually 16-18 C.. though I had a place without climate control for a year or so ... so it was more hot/humid. Of note other 2cs (i and e, even t7) stored in a similar manner or even the same jar showed no signs of change. Though t7 always seemed clumpy it doesn't seem any worse. Its been maybe 7 years? Always stored this way.

Yeah many of the 2C-Xs are flakey I find, 2C-E, 2C-P and the 2C-Ts I've seen have all been this way, but they were even when fresh.

Yes t2 and t7 came slightly clumpy.

But now especially t2 has changed from a flaky powder to all of one dose almost an entire large flake.

The change in t7 isnt nearly as dramatic. E and I seem unchanged.

Tried this substance the other night and it felt perfect. Really considering revisiting 2c-t-7 as well in the same setting because my experience with it was very lack luster.


Experience: Mushrooms, LSD, 4-ho-met, 2c-b, 2c-p, 2c-t-7, DMT, Changa, Ketamine, MDMA, Nitrous, 3-meo-pcp, diphenidine, phenibut, noopept, salvia and various other minimally psychoactive substances

Dosed 35MG orally after eating ~30 minutes before

T+ 1:00: Feeling nothing but expected a slow come up


T+ 2:00: still nothing head to the bathroom and start to wonder if the product was somehow degraded, my girlfriend had dosed ~18mg 2c-b an hour after my dose and was starting to feel it.


T+ 2:30: slight morphing of the walls, I considered insuffilating an ~8mg booster but as I'm considering doing this my girlfriend rolls a joint and I go outside with her to smoke it. I don't smoke marijuana regularly so I was hoping it would send me off.


T+ 2:45: Starting to feel it come on and I'm excited, I lie down in bed and turn the lights off and a psychedelic soup is beginning to overtake my vision. I become very introspective and very hard on myself and start thinking I'm letting my mind decay, I need to read more, I need to improve myself mentally, I need to make an effort to learn. All sorts of poor choices I've made flash before me and I get a bit upset,  then a wave of euphoria hits me and I start to think of all the positive changes I've been making in my life. All the things I've been becoming better at, accomplishing. I have a strong desire to go learn something but feel like I can't do anything like that right now and get a little bit upset. This would be a perfect substance on a summer night for having deep conversation with friends.


T+ 3:15: The desire to learn is still present and my thoughts flow seamlessly, effortlessly, gracefully. Wherever my mind goes great euphoria follows it. The psychedelic soup has consumed my entire vision and is beginning to chip away at real objects trying to engulf them and bring them into the everlasting void. The "soup" has an earthy hue to it, there are purples, greens, reds, blacks mixed in but they are very plain if compared to 2c-b's neon like visuals. I close my eyes and lay in bed and pet my girlfriends head and hair while she watches a movie, with my eyes closed I can see my hand and her head. It is present as a white part of the visuals, I have a vividly clear outline of my hand, it was so clear it was like I was looking at it with my eyes open. But this was only when I was experiencing touch. If I just held it in the air I could not see it. When I moved my hand across her head I would watch in awe as the white particles flew and morphed in the soup adding and changing it's complexion.


T 3:45: We smoke another joint and I note how odd it is, when I turn the lights on my visuals go back to a +1 when I turn them off and let the substance overtake me I'm at a full +3. I can type with no trouble, thinking feels amazing. Never have I experienced a substance that gives such euphoria from just thinking. I sit down and listen to music but turn the screen off to give me complete darkness. While my sense of touch effected my visuals with white particles, music throws blue particles into the soup. My strong desire to learn from earlier is beginning to be fulfilled by the way my sense of touch and emotional state alter my visual field. I'm thoroughly enjoying playing with and exploring where the 2c-t-2 can take me. I go back into bed and turn music on over speakers and go back to rubbing and scratching my girlfriends head.


I lose track of time and didn't go back to the computer after this point and just stayed in bed for the rest of the night.


We have sex and in the same way I could see my hands perfectly through my cev's, I could feel and see her body and my penis vividly and detailed a perfect white outline surrounding it almost like a sketch. The background music keeps tossing blue hue throughout the visuals mixing together with the white forming shapes rich in color, surrounded by an aura. I'm not sure of a better word for this but if you see car headlights on a dark night the "aura" surrounding the bulb is what it looked like. I usually have a problem finishing  while on substances but have no problem what so ever. The only thing I wish was that I had closed my eyes during the climax to see what kind of effect that would've had on the visuals. It felt great, but just thinking, forming thoughts, plans pushing myself for self improvement in my head felt just as good if not better. The long lasting synesthesia was the most awesome part, although not as pronounced as I've had on LSD the fact that it was present in all of my senses for the duration of the entire experience with exquisite.  I believe around the 6 hour mark I stopped peaking and around the 8 hour mark was asleep.


Minimal hangover the next morning, slight headache, oddly enough I never felt nauseous on the come up but in the morning I had a muffin and felt very sick to my stomach but suppressed the urge to throw up and drank some water. Watched some TV and went back to bed and woke up feeling a lot better.


Next time I take this I plan to take it on an empty stomach and see how that effects the potency, if it feels similar then possibly try 40mg or the same 35 with a 8-10mg booster insuffilated an hour or two in. The experience was a breath of fresh air to me because I've been playing around and mixing too many substances together looking for an outlandish experience. It just felt like it had the right amounts of everything I would want in a psychedelic for having an introspective self improvement-esque experience. 


edit: I very rarely post trip reports but just the feelings present were so amazing I thought I'd share

Hey there, welcome. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)   Awesome trip report, I really enjoyed it.  I love 2C-T-2, I think it is truly a gem.  It helped me out of a serious rut in my life.  I have like maybe 2 full doses left, I wonder if we'll ever see it again?

Whoo, that'd be a hefty dose for me! Sounds like you had a great experience, though. ![:-)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) I really like this stuff, but I don't think much of 2C-T-7. Everybody's different--Sasha liked them both ;-)

I'm the opposite. I much prefer 2C-T-7. 2C-T-2 is excellent material, nonetheless, and I regard it highly.

I've taken it a couple of times before, but never pushed the dosage above 17 mg. Though I should have known better from previous trials insufflating it, I erroneously expected it to have 2-3x potency rectally administrated, so my first dose of 8 mg rectally was much to low. Strangely, this compound has about the same strength rectally/insufflated/orally. Compensated nasally to in total 20-25 mg in bumps. The 20-25 mg is becsuse my scale is a bit sketchy

below 10 mg.


Touched the divine space I know from DMT. Beats from my speaker triggered fireworks in my mind and good sounds slmost gave me an orgasm. I really can appreciate how 2C-T-2 were in Shulgins magical half dozen. Thank you Sasha & Ann - I love you so much!


I still wait for my San Pedro's to grow big enough (my peyote I don't want to consume) and I don't seem to be able to find DOM. But always nice to have new experiences to discover. Back to 2C-2-T, I wept over having had the damaged parents I've had; loved them for doing the best they could; was awestruck by the december sunset over a lake; and (though I normally never post things while high) just want to give a big, warm, heartfelt hug to my fellow intelligent - maybe a bit damaged? - curious fellow psychonauts.


I seldom post and I've mostly been lurking for many years. I'd take this oportunity to say I"m so appeciative of so many of you that share my passion for exploring our conciousness through chemicals.


I aspire to give back what I've learned over the 34 years since I had my first psychedelic. I"m a psychotherapist and I can attest to that to a very high degree, psychiatry has no clue whatsoever regarding what to do about human suffering more than prescribe pills to numb the pain so that this crayzy hunt for more things to posses can continue. Psychedelics do pose a threat to society. A bloody good and necessary threat!


Thank You Xorkoth, img999, psy997, Kaleida, CosmicCharlie, Seiko, Cream Gravy?, Cosmic Charlie, Solipsis, lamanogaucha, Pfafffed, JackARoe, Hexagon Sun, Buzz LightBeer, TripsitterNZ, and so many others I can't remember right now. And those who have returned to the source, like MGS. I love you all!


In an utopian future we should all be able to see and touch each other like it used to be at Palenque. Stay safe and don't let the bad drugs take over control. Yours 2C-T-2 intoxicated friend, all alone (though in great company of fantastic music his wife doesn't always appreciate) in his off-grid cabin in the middle of Scandinavian forest.


May all our explorations bring us closer to god (I'm agnosic, though I've been both a beliver and an atheist. DMT has made me more unshure and less attached to the idea of an individual, separste "I". Buckminister Fuller said that "I is a verb" and Yogananda said that "Enlightenment is your egos biggest disappointment", thus I've come to take myself much less seriously and view my self more and more like Joseph Campbell's parable - we're not the lightbulb; we're the light). 


From my heart to your heart - infinite love! (I'll blush tomorrow)

Back at you PsychedelicSummer. You are appreciated more than you can know as well the others you mentioned.  I mean I see screen names but I learn a lot and sometimes it is important to tell people.  I know there are more too.  My memory is faulty. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  But many more personalities that I do appreciate.  In a way we are together everyday, or at least when I log on.


I had 2CT-2 once years ago.  I think I may have posted back in this thread. I remember as I was tripping my wife emailed me to tell me my cousin's husband died. He was drinking too much and his body gave out and I remember talking with him in my mind telling him to take care brother. But I took 2CT-2 at 9:00AM and by 5:00PM I had a big stuptifying glass of strong poppy tea. I miss that stuff but was easy to get from 1994-2009.  I also had a glass after my one and only 2C-! trip  That was very stimulating so by the time I had poppy tea the relief was amazing.


Wrong thread but morphine is my favorite opiate.  I know that is not a popular opinion but morphine fits my body like a glove and is truly Gods Own Medicine.  Oxy seems like aspirin compared.  But that is just me.

Please be wary of miss Morphine - she's a very ugly mistress if you get to know her too well.

**Theta:**


Your kind words are appreciated, PsychedelicSummer, as are your contributions. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) We feel similarly about the people here even though we go through long periods of being away at times. I don't have a whole lot to add right now (it's in the early hours of the morning now after dosing a psychedelic the previous morning and just having spent hours writing a trip report, pretty brain dead) but you've definitely made me more excited for 2C-T-2 too, we have a very small sample of it ourselves and are holding out for the best possible time to take it, it sounds grand.

**(with 8.5 mg 2C-T-2 oxalate)** I took this material quite impulsively because I wanted to see if the salt really held any magic. Analysis via bioassay, so to speak. It gradually started before the first hour already with a slight alteration of mind and noticeable body tension. At a certain point I noticed faint visual disturbances, such as colour shifting and a bit of drifting on surfaces. If I was drug naive, I would have probably not noticed, but I knew what to look out for. At first, I was really frustrated at myself and rather lonely, the character of the experience was rather stern and akin to 2C-E. However, starting at 3h20m, it shifted into a gentle warm glow, followed by a nice afterglow. Afterall, very impressive that this little material had so much effect. Really looking forward to trying a common dose of that one! I can feel this is going to be one of the great ones, very much deserving a spot on the magical half dozen. ![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif)

I just want to say that I did 2ct7 once and 2ct2 recently (20 mg) and honestly I didn't notice any difference between these two substances. Maaaaaybe 2ct2 was more easygoing but it could be because of dosage Idk

To be fair I'd say that I'd notice differences maybe after doing them over 5 times each

me too. I seem to be somewhat rare in that I detest T7 but am a huge fan of T2. They don't seem like similar drugs AT ALL to me. Maybe a little when it comes to the body high but that's about it. The T2 I found to be rougher on the body at least until I became used to it. Now it's actually pretty smooth. I also found T2 to be more visual/neon. 


 T7 at least to me... had a serious delerium component that was not present with T2.

T-2 & T-7 has that sulphur heart warmth that I love that also T-21 and Aleph1 have. T-2 seems a bit more allround than T-7 which had a bit more spark to it. Based on maybe 5-7 average doses of T-2 and one small and one average dose of T-7. Not everyone gets body load from them and at least a part seems psychosomatic and goes away once you've worked your way through it.

T-7 has more risk/potential for dangerous overdose/interactions. How they both will make a big comeback soon!

It's quite rare that I even hear mention of the ALEPHs, how would you characterize an ALEPH compared to other DOx's or 2C-T's?
