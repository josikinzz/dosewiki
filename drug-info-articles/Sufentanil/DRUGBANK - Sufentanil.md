*Source: https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB00708*

## Overview

### Description

This compound belongs to the class of organic compounds known as anilides. These are organic heterocyclic compounds derived from oxoacids RkE(=O)l(OH)m (l not 0) by replacing an OH group by the NHPh group or derivative formed by ring substitution.

### Background

Sufentanil is an opioid analgesic that is used as an adjunct in anesthesia, in balanced anesthesia, and as a primary anesthetic agent.  It is administered by the intravenous, epidural and sublingual routes.
Also known as
Dsuvia
, the sublingual form is used for the management of acute pain in adults that is severe to warrant the use of an opioid analgesic in certified medically supervised healthcare settings, including hospitals, surgical centers, and emergency departments
10
. Consideration may be made in the future for the use of the sublingual form in the US military in cases where analgesia is required immediately
11
.
The sublingual form, manufactured by AcelRx Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (AcelRx), was approved on November 2, 2018
10
.
This route of administration is intended to be a simple, effective, non-invasive analgesic option to enable healthcare professionals to rapidly manage acute pain without difficult intravenous or epidural administration
10
,
4
.

### Indication

The indications for this drug are as follows:
As an analgesic adjunct in the maintenance of balanced general anesthesia in patients who are intubated and ventilated.
As a primary anesthetic agent for the induction and maintenance of anesthesia with 100% oxygen in patients undergoing major surgical procedures, in patients who are intubated and ventilated, such as cardiovascular surgery or neurosurgical procedures in the sitting position, to provide favorable myocardial and cerebral oxygen balance or when extended postoperative ventilation is anticipated.
For epidural administration as an analgesic combined with low dose (usually 12.5 mg per administration) bupivacaine usually during labor and vaginal delivery
The sublingual form is indicated for the management of acute pain in adults that is severe to warrant the use of an opioid analgesic in certified medically supervised healthcare settings, including hospitals, surgical centers, and emergency departments.

### Pharmacodynamics

Effect on the Central Nervous System (CNS)
In clinical settings, sufentanil exerts its principal pharmacologic effects on the central nervous system. Its primary therapeutic actions are analgesia and sedation. Sufentanil may increase pain tolerance and decrease the perception of pain. This drug depresses the respiratory centers, depresses the cough reflex, and constricts the pupils
13
,
9
. When used in balanced general anesthesia, sufentanil has been reported to be as much as 10 times as potent as fentanyl. When administered intravenously as a primary anesthetic agent with 100% oxygen, sufentanil is approximately 5 to 7 times as potent as fentanyl
Label
. High doses of intravenous sufentanil have been shown to cause muscle rigidity, likely as a result of an effect on the substantia nigra and the striate nucleus in the brain. Sleep-inducing (hypnotic) activity can be demonstrated by EEG alterations
Label
.
Effects on the Respiratory System
Sufentanil may cause respiratory depression
Label
.
Effects on the Cardiovascular System
Sufentanil causes peripheral vasodilation which may result in orthostatic hypotension or syncope. Bradycardia may also occur
13
. Clinical signs or symptoms of histamine release and/or peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus, flushing, red eyes and sweating and/or orthostatic hypotension
Label
.
Effects on the Gastrointestinal Tract
Sufentanil causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in both the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine may be delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone may be increased and lead to spasm, resulting in constipation. Other opioid-induced effects may include a reduction in biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of the sphincter of Oddi, as well as temporary elevations in serum amylase
Label
.

### Mechanism of Action

Mu-type opioid receptor
Agonist

### Absorption

Bioavailability of a single sublingual tablet was 52%, decreasing to 35% with repeat dosing
5
.
After epidural administration of incremental doses totaling 5 to 40 mcg sufentanil during labor and delivery, maternal and neonatal sufentanil plasma concentrations were at or near the 0.05 to 0.1 ng/mL limit of detection, and were slightly higher in mothers than in their infants
Label
.

### Metabolism

The liver and small intestine are the major sites of biotransformation
Label
.
Sufentanil is rapidly metabolized to a number of inactive metabolites, with oxidative N- and O-dealkylation being the major routes of elimination
13
.

### Half-life

The elimination half-life is 164 minutes in adults when administered intravenously (IV). The elimination half-life of sufentanil is shorter (e.g. 97 +/- 42 minutes) in infants and children, and longer in neonates (e.g. 434 +/- 160 minutes) compared to that of adolescents and adults
Label
.
After a single administration of a 15 microgram sufentanil sublingual tablet, mean terminal phase half-lives in the range of 6-10 hours have been observed. After multiple administrations, a longer average terminal half-life of up to 18 hours was measured, owing to the higher plasma concentrations of sufentanil achieved after repeated dosing and due to the possibility to quantify these concentrations over a longer time period
13
.

### Toxicity

LD
50
:
18.7 mg/kg (IV in mice)
MSDS
A Note on Respiratory Depression
Major, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of opioids, even in cases where it is used as recommended. Respiratory depression may lead to respiratory arrest and death if not diagnosed and treated appropriately. This drug should be administered only by persons specifically trained in the use of anesthetic drugs and the management of the respiratory effects of potent opioids, including respiration and cardiac resuscitation of patients in the age group being treated. This training must include the establishment and maintenance of a patent airway and assisted ventilation
Label
.
Carcinogenesis
Long-term studies in animals to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of sufentanil have not been conducted
Label
.
Mutagenesis
Sufentanil was not found to be genotoxic in the in vitro bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames assay) or in the in vivo rat bone marrow micronucleous assay
Label
.
Reproductive Toxicity
Sufentanil caused embryolethality in rats and rabbits treated for 10-30 days during pregnancy with 2.5 times the maximum human dose by intravenous administration. The embryolethal effect was thought to be secondary to the toxicity for the mother animal model. No negative effects were noted in another study in rats that were treated with 20 times the maximum human dose in the period of organogenesis. The preclinical effects were only seen following administrations of levels significantly above the maximum human dose, which is therefore of minimal relevance for clinical use
13
.
Pregnancy
May cause fetal harm
Label
The Use in Lactation
Infants exposed to this drug through breast milk should be monitored for excess sedation and respiratory depression
Label
.

### Drug Interactions

This information should not be interpreted without the help of a healthcare provider. If you believe you are experiencing an interaction, contact a healthcare provider immediately. The absence of an interaction does not necessarily mean no interactions exist.

1,2-Benzodiazepine
The risk or severity of adverse effects can be increased when Sufentanil is combined with 1,2-Benzodiazepine.
Abaloparatide
The risk or severity of adverse effects can be increased when Sufentanil is combined with Abaloparatide.
Abametapir
The serum concentration of Sufentanil can be increased when it is combined with Abametapir.
Acebutolol

### Mechanism of action

Sufentanil is a synthetic, potent opioid with highly selective binding to μ-opioid receptors
13
. These receptors are widely distributed in the human brain, spinal cord, and other tissues
8
,
9
.
In general, opioids decrease cAMP (affecting neural signaling pathways), decrease neurotransmitter release, and cause membrane hyperpolarization, all of which contribute to the relief of painful symptoms
9
.
Opiate receptors are coupled with G-protein receptors and function as both positive and negative regulators of synaptic neural transmission via G-proteins that activate effector proteins. Binding of the opiate receptor leads to the exchange of GTP for GDP on the G-protein complex. As the effector system is adenylate cyclase and cAMP, located at the inner surface of the plasma membrane, opioids decrease intracellular cAMP by inhibiting adenylate cyclase. The release of nociceptive neurotransmitters such as substance P, GABA, dopamine, acetylcholine, and noradrenaline is then inhibited
9
.
Opioids close N-type voltage-operated calcium channels (OP2-receptor agonist), also preventing neurotransmitter release
9
.
Sufentanil and other opioids open calcium-dependent inwardly rectifying potassium channels, resulting in hyperpolarization and reduced neuronal excitability

### Volume of distribution

Sufentanil has a distribution time of 1.4 minutes and redistribution time of 17.1 minutes
Label
.
The central volume of distribution after intravenous application of sufentanil is approximately 14 L and the volume of distribution at steady state is approximately 350 L
13
.

### Protein binding

Plasma protein binding of sufentanil, related to the alpha acid glycoprotein concentration, was approximately 93% in healthy males, 91% in mothers and 79% in neonates
Label
.

### Route of elimination

Approximately 80% of the administered dose is excreted within 24 hours and only 2% of the dose is eliminated as unchanged drug
Label
.

### Clearance

The total plasma clearance after single intravenous administration is about 917 l/min
13
.
The clearance of sufentanil in healthy neonates is approximately one-half that in adults and children. The clearance rate of sufentanil can be further reduced by up to a third in neonates with cardiovascular disease

### General Function

A cytochrome P450 monooxygenase involved in the metabolism of sterols, steroid hormones, retinoids and fatty acids (PubMed:10681376, PubMed:11093772, PubMed:11555828, PubMed:12865317, PubMed:14559847, PubMed:15373842, PubMed:15764715, PubMed:19965576, PubMed:20702771, PubMed:21490593, PubMed:21576599). Mechanistically, uses molecular oxygen inserting one oxygen atom into a substrate, and reducing the second into a water molecule, with two electrons provided by NADPH via cytochrome P450 reductase (NADPH--hemoprotein reductase). Catalyzes the hydroxylation of carbon-hydrogen bonds (PubMed:12865317, PubMed:14559847, PubMed:15373842, PubMed:15764715, PubMed:21490593, PubMed:21576599, PubMed:2732228). Exhibits high catalytic activity for the formation of hydroxyestrogens from estrone (E1) and 17beta-estradiol (E2), namely 2-hydroxy E1 and E2, as well as D-ring hydroxylated E1 and E2 at the C-16 position (PubMed:11555828, PubMed:12865317, PubMed:14559847). Plays a role in the metabolism of androgens, particularly in oxidative deactivation of testosterone (PubMed:15373842, PubMed:15764715, PubMed:22773874, PubMed:2732228). Metabolizes testosterone to less biologically active 2beta- and 6beta-hydroxytestosterones (PubMed:15373842, PubMed:15764715, PubMed:2732228). Contributes to the formation of hydroxycholesterols (oxysterols), particularly A-ring hydroxylated cholesterol at the C-4beta position, and side chain hydroxylated cholesterol at the C-25 position, likely contributing to cholesterol degradation and bile acid biosynthesis (PubMed:21576599). Catalyzes bisallylic hydroxylation of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) (PubMed:9435160). Catalyzes the epoxidation of double bonds of PUFA with a preference for the last double bond (PubMed:19965576). Metabolizes endocannabinoid arachidonoylethanolamide (anandamide) to 8,9-, 11,12-, and 14,15-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid ethanolamides (EpETrE-EAs), potentially modulating endocannabinoid system signaling (PubMed:20702771). Plays a role in the metabolism of retinoids. Displays high catalytic activity for oxidation of all-trans-retinol to all-trans-retinal, a rate-limiting step for the biosynthesis of all-trans-retinoic acid (atRA) (PubMed:10681376). Further metabolizes atRA toward 4-hydroxyretinoate and may play a role in hepatic atRA clearance (PubMed:11093772). Responsible for oxidative metabolism of xenobiotics. Acts as a 2-exo-monooxygenase for plant lipid 1,8-cineole (eucalyptol) (PubMed:11159812). Metabolizes the majority of the administered drugs. Catalyzes sulfoxidation of the anthelmintics albendazole and fenbendazole (PubMed:10759686). Hydroxylates antimalarial drug quinine (PubMed:8968357). Acts as a 1,4-cineole 2-exo-monooxygenase (PubMed:11695850). Also involved in vitamin D catabolism and calcium homeostasis. Catalyzes the inactivation of the active hormone calcitriol (1-alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3)) (PubMed:29461981)
