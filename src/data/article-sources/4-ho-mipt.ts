**4-HO-MiPT** (**miprocin**, **4-hydroxy-*****N*****-methyl-*****N*****-isopropyltryptamine**, or **hats**) is an synthetic compound and a lesser-known psychedelic tryptamine. It is thought to be a serotonergic psychedelic, similar to 4-AcO-DMT, LSD and DMT. Its molecular structure and pharmacological effects resemble those of the tryptamine psilocin, which is the primary psychoactive chemical in magic mushrooms.

This substance is relatively uncommon and has only a short history of human use. It was presumably first synthesized by Alexander Shulgin. Its synthesis is described in his book *TiHKAL* along with reports by people who had ingested the compound. Shulgin’s trials and other anecdotal information suggest that 4-HO-MiPT is similar in activity to psilocin.

In terms of its chemistry, 4-HO-MiPT is the 4-hydroxyl analog of the substituted tryptamine known as MiPT (*N-methyl-N-isopropyltryptamine*) as well as the isopropyl homolog and structural analog of 4-HO-DMT (*Psilocin*).

In terms of its pharmacology, 4-HO-MiPT’s psychedelic effects are believed to come from its efficacy at the 5-HT 2A receptor as a partial agonist. However, the role of these interactions and how they result in the psychedelic experience continues to remain elusive.

The effects listed below are based upon the [subjective effects index](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effects_index) and personal experiences of [PsychonautWiki](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) contributors. The listed effects will rarely if ever occur all at once but heavier dosages will increase the chances and are more likely to induce a full range of effects.

**Physical Effects:**

- [Spontaneous tactile sensations](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_effects:_Spontaneous_tactile_sensations) - The “body high” of 4-HO-MiPT can be described as a pleasurable, warm, soft and all-encompassing tingling sensation. This maintains a consistent presence that steadily rises with the onset and hits its limit once the peak has been reached.
- [Sedation](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_effects:_Sedation) - In terms of its effects on the physical energy levels of the tripper, 4-HO-MiPT is considered by most to be relaxing, stoning and mildly sedating. This sense of sedation is often accompanied by compulsive yawning.
- [Runny nose](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_effects:_Runny_nose)
- [Watery eyes](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_effects:_Watery_eyes)

**Cognitive Effects:**

The cognitive effects of 4-HO-MiPT are described by many as extremely relaxing, profound and stoning in style when compared to other commonly used psychedelics such as LSD or 2C-B which tend to be energetic and stimulating. It contains a large number of typical and unique psychedelic cognitive effects.

The most prominent of these typical effects generally include:

- [Enhancement of current mind state](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_effects:_Enhancement_of_current_mind_state)
- [Connectivity of thought](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_effects:_Connectivity_of_thought)
- [Feelings of fascination, importance and awe](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_effects:_Feelings_of_fascination,_importance_and_awe)
- [Time distortion](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_effects:_Time_distortion)
- [Outrospection](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_effects:_Outrospection)
- [Deja-Vu](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_effects:_Deja-Vu)
- [Removal of cultural filter](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_effects:_Removal_of_cultural_filter)
- [Feelings of predeterminism](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_effects:_Feelings_of_predeterminism)
- [Conceptual thinking](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_effects:_Conceptual_thinking)
- [Direct communication with the subconsious](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_effects:_Direct_communication_with_the_subconscious)
- [Ego suppression, loss and death](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_effects:_Ego_suppression,_loss_and_death)
- [Feelings of interdependent opposites](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_effects:_Feelings_of_interdependent_opposites)
- [Delusions](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_effects:_Delusions)
- [States of unity and interconnectedness](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_effects:_States_of_unity_and_interconnectedness)
- [Enhancement and suppression cycles](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_effects:_Enhancement_and_suppression_cycles) - This can be described as constant waves of extremely stimulated and profound thinking which are spontaneously surpassed in a cyclic fashion by waves of general thought suppression and mental intoxication. These two states seem to switch between each other in a consistent loop once every 20 - 60 minutes.

**Visual effects:**

*Enhancements*

4-HO-MiPT presents a full and complete array of possible visual enhancements which generally includes:

- [Increased visual acuity](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Increased_visual_acuity)
- [Enhancement of colour](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Enhancement_of_colour)
- [Enhanced pattern recognition](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Enhanced_pattern_recognition)

*Distortions*

As for visual distortions and alterations, effects experienced are detailed below:

- **[Drifting](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Drifting)** *([Melting](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Drifting#Melting), [Flowing](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Drifting#Flowing), [Breathing](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Drifting#Breathing) and [morphing](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Drifting#morphing))* - In comparison to other psychedelics, this effect can be described as highly detailed, realistic, slow and smooth in motion and static in appearance.
- **[Tracers](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects_-_Psychedelics#Tracers)**
- **[After images](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects_-_Psychedelics#After_images)**
- **[Texture repetition](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects_-_Psychedelics#Symmetrical_texture_repetition)**
- **[Colour shifting](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects_-_Psychedelics#Colour_shifting)**
- **[Scenery slicing](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects_-_Psychedelics#Scenery_Slicing)**

*Geometry*

The visual geometry that is present throughout this trip can be described as more similar in appearance to that of Psilocin, Ayahuasca and 2C-E than LSD or 2C-B. It can be comprehensively described through its [variations](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Geometry#Variations) as intricate in complexity, abstract in form, organic in style, structured in organization, brightly lit and multicoloured in scheme, glossy in shading, soft in edges, large in size, slow in speed, smooth in motion, rounded in corners, unimmersive in depth and consistent in intensity. The visuals have a very “natural” feel to them and at higher dosages are significantly more likely to result in states of [Level 8B](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Level_8B) visual geometry over [Level 8A](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Level_8A).

*Hallucinatory States*

4-HO-MiPT and its various other forms produce a full range of high level hallucinatory states in a fashion that is more consistent and reproducible than that of many other commonly used psychedelics. These effects generally include:

- [Transformations](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Transformations)
- [Internal hallucinations](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Internal_hallucinations) ([Autonomous entities](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Autonomous_entities), [Settings, sceneries, and landscapes](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Settings,_sceneries,_and_landscapes), [Alterations in perspective](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Alterations_in_perspective) and [Scenarios and plots](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Scenarios_and_plots)) - This effect is very consistent in dark environments at appropriately high dosages. They can be comprehensively described through their [variations](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Internal_hallucinations#Variations) as lucid in believability, interactive in style, new experiences in content, autonomous in controllability, [geometry](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Geometry)-based in style and almost exclusively of a religious, spiritual, mystical, science fiction or transcendental nature in their overall theme.

**Auditory Effects:**

The auditory effects of 4-HO-MiPT are common in their occurrence and exhibit a full range of effects which commonly include:

- [Enhancements](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_effects:_Enhancements)
- [Distortions](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_effects:_Distortions)
- [Hallucinations](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_effects:_Hallucinations)

**Physical Health Effects, Potential Addiction and Tolerance:**

The toxicity and long term health effects of recreational 4-HO-MiPT use do not seem to have been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dosage is unknown. This is because 4-HO-MiPT is a research chemical with very little history of human usage. Anecdotal evidence from people who have tried 4-HO-MiPT within the psychonaut community suggests that there are no negative health effects attributed to simply trying this drug at low to moderate doses or using it very sparingly (but nothing can be completely guaranteed).

There is no current data for the LD50 of 4-HO-MiPT, but it is thought to be high.

4-HO-MiPT does not seem to be physically addictive and many users experience a self-regulating quality. There seems to be a tolerance build up when used consecutively multiple days in a row which requires one to double their dosage each time to achieve the same effects.

**Legal issues:**

- **Sweden:** Sveriges riksdags health ministry Statens folkhälsoinstitut classified 4-HO-MiPT as a “health hazard” under the act Lagen om förbud mot vissa hälsofarliga varor (translated Act on the Prohibition of Certain Goods Dangerous to Health) as of November 1, 2005, making it illegal to sell or possess.[[1]](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-HO-MiPT#cite_note-1)
- **United Kingdom:** The substance could be considered illegal in the UK under the Misuse of Drugs Act of 1971.
- **United States:** 4-HO-MiPT is an unscheduled drug in the United States. However, it is an analog of psilocin, which could lead to prosecution under the Federal Analog Act.

**Conclusion:**

4-HO-MiPT induces a generic yet worthwhile tryptamine experience which can be described as almost indistinguishable from that of psilocybin mushrooms and 4-AcO-DMT. It also has the same dosage range to that of 4-AcO-DMT and I would recommend this substance to anybody who is interested in experiencing psychedelia.

**4-Hydroxy-MIPT Chemistry** 
 **by Erowid** 
---
 
 
4-HO-MiPT and Acetoxy-MiPT are closely related chemicals. It is possible that 4-Acetoxy-MiPT is metabolized into 4-HO-MiPT in the body in much the same way that Psilocybin is metabolized into Psilocin before it reaches the brain. They will both have very similar effects when taken orally, though dosage will be slightly different.

*TiHKAL Entry #22*


## SYNTHESIS
To 10 mL of a stirred solution of LAH (1 M in THF under N2), there was added dropwise a solution of 600 mg 4-acetoxyindol-3-yl-N-isopropyl-N-methylglyoxylamide 4-acetoxy-N-methyl-N-isopropylindole-3-glyoxylamide in 10 mL anhydrous THF. When the addition was complete, the reaction mixture was brought to a reflux on the steam bath for 15 min. After cooling to 40 Â°C, sufficient water was added to decompose both the reaction complex and the excess hydride. After filtration through Celite (under an N2 atmosphere), the solvent was removed under vacuum, and the solid residue recrystallized from EtOAc/hexane. There was thus obtained 340 mg .34 g (74%) of 4-hydroxy-N-methyl-N-isopropyltryptamine (4-HO-MIPT) with a mp of 123â124 Â°C. 4-HO-MIPT discolors quickly if it is not kept in an inert atmosphere and in a freezer. Anal: C,H,N.


## DOSAGE

## DURATION

## QUALITATIVE COMMENTS
(with 12 mg, orally) âIt was just an hour ago that I swallowed the capsule, and everything is happening. I was completely developed at 45 minutes. The imagery with my eyes closed is vivid. The music is exceptionally sensual. I notice a tendency to twitch but it doesnât bother me. Everything is rollingâhow can they allow an erotic piece like the Saint SaÃ«ns second piano concerto to ever appear in public, let alone over the radio? A very rapid decline between the third and fourth hour. A rich day for love, insights, fantasy and for retreating into oneâs mind. A rich day for discovery.â

(with 12 mg, orally) âI suspended the solids in water, and a drop of HCl put it into solution immediately. The first awareness was unmistakable at twenty minutes, and from there it was a rapid and noisy development ending at about an hour. But this lasted for only another 40 minutes, and then dropped off quite rapidly. The erotic was excellent, but there were few visuals and I had difficulty connecting fantasy to music. Good appetite afterwards, and I had no trouble getting to sleep.â

(with 15 mg acetate ester, orally) âAn interesting mixture of intoxication and sedation, progressing to a very relaxed state with some motor incoordination. Just a little bit like alcohol or GHB. There was no drifting of thoughts nor any gut disturbance at any time, although I wasnât very hungry. Conversation was easy.â

(with 20 mg, orally) âEarly signs (muscle sensations) were noticed in 10 minutes. In another 10 minutes a rapid heightening of all senses ensued, reaching a plateau in 40 minutes and beginning to decline in 3 hours with a return to near normal in 5â6 hours. The intensity of the experience is marked. At the plateau, communication (verbal) is difficult with intense alteration in the sense of time and distance. Multiple and overlapping wave forms occur with an extremely intense color alteration. Drifting in and out of the body is common with an increased sense of body processes, i.e., blood flow in vessels. Muscular sense is increased and a feeling of soaring in bodiless flight is experienced. A mild vertigo was felt with attempted walking but is not associated with nausea. Some anxiety was experienced initially, but could be interpreted as a reaction to the extremely powerful onset. A curious, probably idiosyncratic effect, was of possessing the essence of sexual power associated with being a large jungle cat. The idea was prominent for some time. Conservatively, this compound is at least twice as active as psilocin at comparable doses, in terms of plateau or peak effect. External stimuli, especially light, were distracting to the point of annoyance. Sounds can be seen, words explode into showers of bright points with eyes closed. Other eyes-closed imagery is prominent with patterns (in color); at times soaring clouds dominate the eyes-closed scenery. I cannot overemphasize the intensity of the experience. I would not want to go much higher than 20 milligrams (50 milligrams of psilocin is not as intense).â

(with 30 mg acetate ester, orally) âIt was as if I had downed a few martinis in a hurryâexcept that there were eye-closed visuals in a lot of different colors, especially metallic greens. I had jaw clenching and a body tremor, reminding me of ecstasy except is was not in any way stimulated. I listened to music in front of a fireplace in a darkened room and I saw bright colorful unstructured patterns. Seven hours and I fell into an easy sleep and was fine the next day.â


## EXTENSIONS AND COMMENTARY
Here, as with the 4-HO-DMT (psilocin) and the 4-HO-DET entries, some care must be made with the use of the term âacetateâ or âphosphate.â As these materials are both bases (tertiary amines) and acids (hydroxy indoles), they are in effect internal salts. For stability, they are usually converted into salts (at the amine end) or esters (at the phenolic end), or both. In this context, the term âacetateâ can mean either modification, a salt or an ester involving acetic acid. And, of course, a phosphate can be either a salt or an ester. I will try to append the additional term âsaltâ or âesterâ whenever this ambiguity is possible. In all of these studies, the acetate is the ester, and some of these are free bases, some are the hydrochloride salts and some are the fumarate salts.

A large number of related homologues of psilocin have been synthesized and described, and some of them tasted to varying degrees, but none of them to a degree of definition to justify a recipe devoted just to them. With the 4-hydroxyl group assuring some measure of oral activity, all of these could serve as a structural structurae activity relationship gestalt to selectively, and specifically, evaluate the geometric nature of the nitrogen substituents.

If one were to be a complete perfectionist in these areas of chemistry, one should actually make the phosphate ester of 4-HO-MIPT, as this would be the exact homologue of psilocybin. But that would be a great amount of additional work, just to have the body chop off the ester group as soon as it had the chance. The current thinking is that there would be the same activity with either compound, making allowances for the change in molecular weight. But at least it might be a lot more stable for storage. What about the sulfate ester? It should be a very stable salt, and the body has sulfatases just as it has phosphatases. Maybe the ubiquitous non-specific esterases would work as well. A number of studies have been made with the acetate ester (some mentioned here) and it should whap off immediately once itâs inside you.

A careful clinical comparison of the acetate ester of psilocin with the phosphate ester and the free phenol might help resolve this question. The ideal way of resolving this would be to run pharmacokinetic studies on blood levels of these three materials, in parallel with the psychopharmacological responses. I feel that this is not likely to be done in the foreseeable future.

**4-Hydroxy-N-methyl-N-isopropyltryptamine** (also known as **4-HO-MiPT** , and **Miprocin** ) is a novel [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) substance of the [tryptamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tryptamine) class that produces [psilocybin-like](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocybin) psychedelic effects when [administered](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Routes_of_administration) . It is part of a series of psychedelic [substituted tryptamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tryptamines) such as [4-AcO-DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-AcO-DMT) , [4-HO-MET](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-HO-MET) , [4-HO-DiPT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-HO-DiPT) that are considered to produce variations of the core psychedelic effects typified by [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) .

This substance is relatively uncommon and has only a short history of human use. [Alexander Shulgin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alexander_Shulgin) evaluated its activity in humans in 1979, describing a trial of 12mg as a richly insightful and highly erotic experience. A description of 4-HO-MiPT is included in Shulgin's 1997 book [TiHKAL](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/TiHKAL) . Shulgin's trials and other anecdotal reports suggest that 4-HO-MiPT is similar in activity to [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) , the active component in [psilocybin mushrooms](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocybin_mushrooms) .

Very little data exists about the pharmacological properties, metabolism, and toxicity of 4-HO-MiPT in humans. As with [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) , there have been no reported deaths from 4-HO-MiPT use despite the existence of reports of people taking doses which far exceeds the active dose. This suggests that it is well-tolerated physiologically. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

Today, 4-HO-MiPT is either used [recreationally](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Recreational_drug_use) or as an [entheogenic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entheogenic) substance and is typically distributed as a grey-area [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) by online vendors.

## History and culture

The first synthesis of 4-HO-MiPT was published in 1981 by a team of chemists led by David Repke. Repke and Shulgin later collaborated on a paper evaluating the effects of different oxygen substituents on the MiPT structure, describing 4-HO-MiPT as the most interesting of the series and the only one to possess classical hallucinogen effects.

## Chemistry

4-HO-MiPT or 4-hydroxy-N-methyl-N-isopropyltryptamine is a synthetic indole alkaloid molecule of the [tryptamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tryptamine) class. Tryptamines share a core structure comprised of a bicylic indole heterocycle attached at R 3 to an amino group via an ethyl side chain. 4-HO-MiPT is substituted at R 4 of its indole heterocycle with a hydroxyl (HO) functional group OH-. It also contains a methyl group and an isopropyl chain bound to the terminal amine R N of its tryptamine backbone (MiPT). 4-HO-MiPT is the N-substituted isopropyl homologue of [4-HO-DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-HO-DMT) ( *Psilocin* ).

## Pharmacology

4-HO-MiPT's [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) effects are believed to come from its efficacy at the [5-HT2A receptor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin#The_5-HT_system) as a [partial agonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist#Agonists) . However, the role of these interactions and how they result in the [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) experience continues to remain elusive. 4-HO-MiPT is thought to be a serotonergic psychedelic. Like other serotonergic psychedelics, its method of action is believed to result from its partial agonism of 5-HT 2A and 5-HT 1A serotonin receptors.

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation)** & **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)** - 4-HO-MiPT is considered have the paradoxical property of both being relaxing, stoning and mildly sedating with a marked sense of [physical stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation) that distinguishes it from related substances like [psilocybin mushrooms](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocybin_mushrooms) or [4-AcO-DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-AcO-DMT) .
- **[Spontaneous physical sensations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_physical_sensations)** - The "body high" of 4-HO-MiPT can be described as a pleasurable, warm, soft, and all-encompassing tingling sensation. This maintains a consistent presence that steadily rises following the onset and hits its limit once the peak has been reached.
- **[Changes in felt bodily form](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Changes_in_felt_bodily_form)** - This effect is often accompanied by a sense of warmth or [psychophysical unity](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Unity_and_interconnectedness#Unity_between_the_self_and_specific_external_systems) and usually occurs around or directly after the peak of the experience. Users can feel as if they are physically part of or conjoined with other objects in a seamless continuity. This is usually reported as feeling comfortable, tranquil and mindful, though it can also manifest in the form of bodily tension.
- **[Changes in felt gravity](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Changes_in_felt_gravity)**
- **[Pain relief](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pain_relief)** - This effect is distinct from pain relief produced by opioids. It appears to manifest itself as a result of changes in how the user perceives their body, rather than direct suppression of pain.
- **[Nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea)** - This effect can be greatly lessened or even completely avoided if the individual has an empty stomach prior to ingestion. It is sometimes recommended that one either refrain from eating for approximately 6 to 8 hours before-hand, or to eat a light meal 3 to 4 hours before if the user is feeling physically fatigued and undernourished. The nausea produced by 4-HO-MiPT is generally considered to be much less prominent than it is with [psilocybin mushrooms](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocybin#Psilocybin-containing_mushrooms) , perhaps owing to the fact that there is no fungal-matter the body has to digest when the isolated synthetic form is consumed.
- **[Temperature regulation suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Temperature_regulation_suppression)** - 4-HO-MiPT can cause fluctuates in the user's internal sense of temperature, which can manifest as sudden bouts of uncomfortable coldness or warmth, which is why a climate-controllable environment is strongly recommended in terms of a proper setting for a trip.
- **[Muscle contractions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_contractions)** - The muscle contractions that can occasionally be produced by 4-HO-MiPT tend to be transient and benign feeling in nature, compared to many other [tryptamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tryptamines) , [phenethylamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamines) and [lysergamides](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Lysergamides) .
- **[Olfactory hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Olfactory_hallucination)**
- **[Frequent urination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Frequent_urination)**
- **[Pupil dilation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pupil_dilation)**
- **[Increased salivation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_salivation)**
- **[Excessive yawning](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Excessive_yawning)** - This effect seems to be uniquely pronounced among psilocin and related tryptamines. It can occur to a lesser degree on [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) and very rarely on psychedelic [phenethylamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamines) like [mescaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mescaline) . It typically occurs in conjunction with [watery eyes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Watery_eyes) .
- **[Watery eyes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Watery_eyes)**
- **[Teeth grinding](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Teeth_grinding)** - This component is considerably less intense when compared with that of substances like [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) when it does happen to occur, but happens more readily than with related substances like [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) or [psilocybin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocybin) , perhaps owing to the greater degree of stimulation it produces.
- **[Seizure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizure)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] - This is likely a rare effect but may occur for those who are predisposed to them, especially while in physically taxing conditions such as being dehydrated, fatigued, undernourished, or overheated. However it should be noted that there are no documented cases of seizures occurring with this compound. ### Visual effects
 
- #### Enhancements
 
- **[Colour enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_enhancement)**
- **[Pattern recognition enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition_enhancement)**

- **[Brightness alteration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Brightness_alteration)**
- **[Diffraction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Diffraction)**
 
#### Geometry
 
The visual geometry that may be experienced can be described as more similar in appearance to that of [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) , [ayahuasca](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ayahuasca) and [2C-E](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-E) than [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) or [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) . It can be comprehensively described through its [variations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Geometry#Variations) as intricate in complexity, abstract in form, organic in style, structured in organization, brightly lit and multicoloured in scheme, glossy in shading, soft in edges, large in size, slow in speed, smooth in motion, rounded in corners, non-immersive in depth and consistent in intensity. The visuals have a very "natural" feel to them and at higher dosages are significantly more likely to result in states of [level 8B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/8B_Geometry) visual geometry over [level 8A](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/8A_Geometry) .
 
#### Hallucinatory states
 
4-HO-MiPT and its various other forms produce a full range of high level hallucinatory states in a fashion that is more consistent and reproducible than that of many other commonly used [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) . These effects generally include:
 
- **[Machinescapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Machinescapes)**
- **[Transformations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Transformations)**
- **[Internal hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucination)** ( *[autonomous entities](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Autonomous_entities)* ; *[settings, sceneries, and landscapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Settings,_sceneries,_and_landscapes)* ; *[perspective hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perspective_hallucinations)* and *[scenarios and plots](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenarios_and_plots)* ) - This effect is very consistent in dark environments at appropriately high dosages. They can be comprehensively described through their [variations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucinations#Variations) as lucid in believability, interactive in style, new experiences in content, autonomous in controllability, [geometry](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Geometry) -based in style and almost exclusively of a personal, religious, spiritual, science-fiction, fantasy, surreal, nonsensical or transcendental nature in their overall theme.
- **[External hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/External_hallucination)** ( *[autonomous entities](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Autonomous_entities)* ; *[settings, sceneries, and landscapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Settings,_sceneries,_and_landscapes)* ; *[perspective hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perspective_hallucinations)* and *[scenarios and plots](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenarios_and_plots)* ) - These are more common within dark environments and can be comprehensively described through their [variations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/External_hallucinations#Variations) as lucid in believability, interactive in style, new experiences in content, autonomous in controllability, geometry-based in style and almost exclusively of a personal, religious, spiritual, science-fiction, fantasy, surreal, nonsensical or transcendental nature in their overall theme. ### Cognitive effects
 
- The cognitive effects of 4-HO-MiPT are described by many as extremely relaxing, profound and stoning in style when compared to other commonly used [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) such as [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) or [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) which tend to be energetic and stimulating. It contains a large number of typical and unique psychedelic cognitive effects. The most prominent of these typical effects generally include: 
- **[Analysis enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Analysis_enhancement)**
- **[Conceptual thinking](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Conceptual_thinking)**
- **[Autonomous voice communication](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Autonomous_voice_communication)**
- **[Déjà vu](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/D%C3%A9j%C3%A0_vu)**
- **[Emotion enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Emotion_enhancement)**
- **[Enhancement and suppression cycles](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Enhancement_and_suppression_cycles)** - This can be described as constant waves of extremely stimulated and profound thinking which are spontaneously surpassed in a cyclic fashion by waves of general thought suppression and mental intoxication. These two states seem to switch between each other in a consistent loop once every 20 - 60 minutes.
- **[Cognitive euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_euphoria)**
- **[Increased libido](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_libido)**
- **[Immersion enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Immersion_enhancement)**
- **[Novelty enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Novelty_enhancement)**
- **[Creativity enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Creativity_enhancement)**

- - **[Auditory enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_enhancement)**
- **[Auditory distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_distortion)**
- **[Auditory hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_hallucination)** ### Multi-sensory effects
 
- - **[Synaesthesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Synaesthesia)** - In its fullest manifestation, this is a very rare and non-reproducible effect. Increasing the dosage can increase the likelihood of this occurring, but seems to only be a prominent part of the experience among those who are already predisposed to synaesthetic states. ### Transpersonal effects
 
- It should be noted that these effects are reported to occur less reliably and impactfully than with the closely related [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) or [psilocybin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocybin) , and generally require heavier doses to potentially induce. They are listed below as follows: 
- **[Spirituality enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spirituality_enhancement)**
- **[Existential self-realization](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Existential_self-realization)**
- **[Unity and interconnectedness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Unity_and_interconnectedness)**
### Combination effects

- **[Cannabis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cannabis)** - Cannabis majorly amplifies the sensory and cognitive effects of 4-HO-MiPT. This should be used with extreme caution, especially if one is not experienced with psychedelics. This interaction can also amplify the [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [confusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Confusion) and [delusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusion) producing aspects of cannabis significantly. Those who choose to use this combination are advised to start off with only a fraction of their usual cannabis dose, and slow down the pace of their normal intake considerably.
- **[Dissociatives](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociatives)** - Dissociatives can enhance the geometry, euphoria, dissociation and hallucinatory effects of 4-HO-MiPT. Dissociative-induced [holes, spaces, and voids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_disconnection#Holes.2C_spaces_and_voids) while under the influence of 4-HO-MiPT can result in significantly more vivid visuals than dissociatives alone, along with more intense [internal hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucinations) , [confusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Confusion) , [nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea) , [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) and chances of a [psychotic reaction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) .
- **[Benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines)** - Depending on the dosage, benzodiazepines can slightly to completely reduce the intensity of the cognitive, physical and visual effects of a miprocin trip. They can be very efficient at largely stopping or mitigating a [bad trip](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bad_trip) at the cost of amnesia and reduced trip intensity. Caution is advised when acquiring them for this purpose, however, due to the very high addiction potential that benzodiazepines possess.
- **[Psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics)** - When used in combination with other psychedelics, the physical, cognitive and visual effects of each substance intensify and synergize strongly with each other. The synergy between those substances is unpredictable, and for this reason, is generally not advised. If choosing to combine psychedelics, it is recommended to start with lower dosages than one would take for either substance individually.

### Experience reports

There are currently anecdotal reports which describe the effects of this compound within our [experience index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Experience_index) .

## Toxicity and harm potential

The toxicity and long-term health effects of recreational 4-HO-MiPT use do not seem to have been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dose is unknown. This is because 4-HO-MiPT is a [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) with very little history of human usage.

Anecdotal evidence from those have tried 4-HO-MiPT suggests that there are no negative health effects attributed to simply trying the drug by itself at low to moderate doses and using it very sparingly (but nothing can be completely guaranteed). [Independent research](https://www.google.com/) should always be done to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe before consumption.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this substance.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

4-HO-MiPT is not habit-forming, and the desire to use it can actually decrease with use. It is most often self-regulating.

Tolerance to the effects of 4-HO-MiPT is built almost immediately after ingestion. After that, it takes about 3 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 7 days to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). 4-HO-MiPT presents cross-tolerance with all [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) , meaning that after the consumption of 4-HO-MiPT all psychedelics will have a reduced effect.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **[Lithium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_(medication))** - Lithium is commonly prescribed for the treatment of [bipolar disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder) . There is a large body of anecdotal evidence that suggests taking it with [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) significantly increases the risk of [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) and [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) . As a result, this combination is strictly discouraged.
- **[Cannabis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cannabis)** - Cannabis may have an unexpectedly strong and unpredictable synergy with the effects of 4-HO-MiPT. Caution is advised with this combination as it can significantly increase the risk of adverse psychological reactions like [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) , and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) . Users are advised to start off with only a fraction of their normal cannabis dose and take long breaks between hits to avoid unintentional overdose.
- **[Stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants)** - Stimulants like [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) , [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) or [methylphenidate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylphenidate) affect many parts of the brain and alter [dopaminergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) function. This combination can increase the risk of [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) , and [thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops) . This interaction may also result in an elevated risk of [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) . [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol)** - Tramadol is well-documented to lower the seizure threshold and [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) may act to trigger seizures in susceptible individuals.

*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4-HO-MiPT*

4-HO-MiPT, also known as 4-hydroxy-N-methyl-N-isopropyltryptamine or as miprocin, is a psychedelic drug of the tryptamine and 4-hydroxytryptamine families related to psilocin (4-HO-DMT). It appears to be similar to psilocin in terms of onset, duration, and effects. The drug is taken orally.
It acts as a non-selective serotonin receptor agonist, including of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor among others. The drug is closely related structurally to MiPT, 4-HO-DiPT, and psilocin (4-HO-DMT).
4-HO-MiPT was first described in the literature by David Repke and colleagues in 1981. Its effects in humans were subsequently described by Repke and Alexander Shulgin in 1985 and 1997.

## Use and effects

According to Alexander Shulgin in his book TiHKAL (Tryptamines I Have Known and Loved) and other publications, 4-HO-MiPT has a dose range of 12 to 25 mg, an onset of action of 10 to 20 minutes, a time to peak of 40 to 45 minutes, and a duration of 4 to 6 hours. It has an estimated typical dose of 18.5 mg. The drug has been described as at least twice as potent as psilocin (4-HO-DMT) at comparable doses, with 20 mg 4-HO-MiPT being subjectively stronger than 50 mg psilocin in one individual. However, in another person, the effects of 4-AcO-MiPT (a prodrug of 4-HO-MiPT) at a dose of 30 mg were described as considerably more modest than expected.
The effects of 4-HO-MiPT have been reported to include closed-eye visuals, vivid mental imagery, few psychedelic visuals, wave-form visuals, intense color alterations, multiple images of the same object with intense colored halos, illusory alteration of the size and distance of objects, heightening of senses, intensification and enhanced discrimination of sounds, increased sense of bodily processes such as blood flow and muscles, synesthesia of sound and sight, intense alteration in sense of time and distance, feelings of drifting in and out of the body, flight of ideas, philosophical thinking, euphoria, enhanced music appreciation, enhanced eroticism, and facilitation of love, insights, fantasy, introspection, and discovery. Other effects included intoxication, sedation, feeling drunk, relaxation, some initial anxiety, easy to difficult verbal communication, easy distraction and annoyance by external stimuli such as light, appetite loss, and insomnia. Physical effects of the drug have been reported to include twitching, muscle sensations, motor incoordination, slight lightheadedness, mild vertigo, jaw clenching, and body tremors.

## Interactions

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

4-HO-MiPT acts as a non-selective serotonin receptor agonist, including of the serotonin 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, and 5-HT2C receptors. It shows the highest potency and efficacy as an agonist of the 5-HT2A receptor, moderate potency as a partial agonist of the 5-HT2B receptor, and low potency with high-efficacy as a partial agonist of the 5-HT2C receptor. Additionally, the drug has been found to act as a moderate-potency serotonin transporter (SERT) blocker or serotonin reuptake inhibitor. Its low affinity and potency at the 5-HT1A receptor suggest minimal contribution to this drug's effects. 4-HO-MiPT exhibits approximately 7-fold selectivity for activation of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor over the serotonin 5-HT2C receptor, and 4-fold preference relative to SERT inhibition. Affinities towards receptors outside of the serotonin receptor family have not yet been assessed.
The drug induces the head-twitch response, a behavioral proxy of psychedelic effects, in rodents. Its potency for inducing the head-twitch response in mice is about 4- or 5-fold lower than that of psilocin.

## Chemistry

4-HO-MiPT, also known as 4-hydroxy-N-methyl-N-isopropyltryptamine, is a synthetic derivative of the substituted tryptamine and 4-hydroxytryptamine families. It is the 4-hydroxy analogue of N-methyl-N-isopropyltryptamine (MiPT) and the N-isopropyl homologue of psilocin (4-HO-DMT).

### Properties

4-HO-MiPT appears to be a relatively unstable compound, discoloring quickly if not kept in an inert atmosphere and in a freezer. The drug and its prodrug analogue 4-AcO-MiPT have been used as the free base, hydrochloride salt, and fumarate salt.

### Crystal structure

In August 2019, Chadeayne et al. solved the crystal structure of 4-HO-MiPT fumarate. Its systematic name is [2-(4-hydroxy-1H-indol-3-yl)ethyl](methyl)propan-2-ylazanium 3-carboxyprop-2-enoate monohydrate. The salt consists of a protonated tryptammonium cation and a 3-carboxyacrylate (hydrogen fumarate) anion in the asymmetric unit along with a water molecule of crystallization.

### Synthesis

The chemical synthesis of 4-HO-MiPT has been described.

### Analogues

Analogues of 4-HO-MiPT include N-methyl-N-isopropyltryptamine (MiPT), 4-AcO-MiPT, 4-MeO-MiPT, 5-MeO-MiPT, 4-HO-DiPT, psilocin (4-HO-DMT), 4-HO-MET, 4-HO-EiBT, and 4-HO-McPT, among others.

## History

4-HO-MiPT was first described in the scientific literature by David Repke and colleagues in 1981. Its effects in humans were described by Repke and Alexander Shulgin and colleagues in 1985. The pharmacology of 4-HO-MiPT at serotonin receptors was described by Dennis McKenna and Repke and colleagues in 1990. The effects of 4-HO-MiPT in humans were described in greater detail by Shulgin in his 1997 book TiHKAL (Tryptamines I Have Known and Loved).

## Society and culture

### Legal status

#### Russia

4-HO-MiPT is in Schedule 1 in Russia as an analog of 4-hydroxytryptamine.

#### Sweden

Sveriges riksdags health ministry Statens folkhälsoinstitut classified 4-HO-MiPT as "health hazard" under the act Lagen om förbud mot vissa hälsofarliga varor (translated Act on the Prohibition of Certain Goods Dangerous to Health) as of 1 November 2005, in regulation SFS 2005:733 listed as "4-hydroxi-N,N-metylisopropyltryptamin (4-HO-MIPT)", making it illegal to sell or possess.

#### United Kingdom

The substance could also be considered illegal in the United Kingdom under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971.

#### United States

4-HO-MiPT is an unscheduled drug in the United States. However, it is arguably an analog of psilocin, which could lead to prosecution under the Federal Analog Act.
