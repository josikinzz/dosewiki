# 5-MAPB
*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5-MAPB*

5-MAPB, also known as 5-(N-methyl-2-aminopropyl)benzofuran, is an entactogen and designer drug of the amphetamine family that is similar to MDMA in its structure and effects.
5-MAPB was first encountered as a novel designer drug in 2013 and described in the scientific literature in 2014. It has been patented by Tactogen as an entactogen for potential use as a medicine.

## Use and effects

5-MAPB is an entactogen and has been described by Matthew Baggott as the MDMA analogue so far known that has the closest effects and so-called "magic" to MDMA itself. Other analogues that lack the full quality of MDMA include MBDB, methylone, 6-APDB, 5-APDB, 6-APB, 5-APB, MDAT, and MDAI, among others.
In addition to its use on its own, 5-MAPB, along with the related entactogen MDAI, is employed as a component of the MDMA-mimicking Borax combo.

## Interactions

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

5-MAPB acts as a serotonin–norepinephrine–dopamine releasing agent with EC50Tooltip half-maximal effective concentration values for induction of monoamine release of 64 nM for serotonin, 24 nM for norepinephrine, and 41 nM for dopamine using rat brain synaptosomes. It is also a partial agonist of the serotonin 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, and 5-HT2C receptors. In addition, unlike MDMA, it is a potent agonist of the serotonin 5-HT1B receptor.

5-MAPB has been marketed as a less- or non-neurotoxic alternative to MDMA. However, 5-MAPB has been found to be a dose-dependent serotonergic neurotoxin in rodents similarly to MDMA, and might also be a dopaminergic neurotoxin.

### Pharmacokinetics

Little formal knowledge exists on 5-MAPB. It does not form the α-methyldopamine metabolite that contributes to the neurotoxicity of MDMA or MDA. A study in rats indicated that the major metabolites of 5-MAPB are 5-APB and 3-carboxymethyl-4-hydroxymethamphetamine.

## History

5-MAPB was first encountered as a novel designer drug in 2013 and described in the scientific literature in 2014.

## Society and culture

### Legal Status

#### Canada

5-MAPB is not listed itself in the CDSA but since it is structurally related to MDMA it may be considered illegal in Canada, although this has not been tested in court.

#### China

As of October 2015, 5-MAPB is a controlled substance in China.

#### Finland

Scheduled in the "government decree on psychoactive substances banned from the consumer market".

#### Luxembourg

As of July 2021, 5-MAPB is not cited in the list of prohibited substances. Therefore, it is still a legal substance.

### United Kingdom

5-MAPB was originally banned in the UK in June 2013 under a Temporary class drug order. On March 5, 2014, the UK Home Office announced that 5-MAPB would be made a class B drug on 10 June 2014 alongside every other benzofuran entactogen and many structurally related drugs.
