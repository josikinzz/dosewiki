**1-propionyl-lysergic acid diethylamide** (abbreviated as** 1P-LSD** or **1P-LAD**) is a hallucinogenic psychedelic drug of the lysergamidefamily.

This substance has little to no history of human usage. It has not
been reported upon within any formal scientific literature and is
almost entirely unknown by both the academics and public. However,
given its similarity to LSD
and ALD-52,
the structural similarity reliably suggests an extremely similar
effect profile. Due to the lack of research regarding the substance,
all discussion regarding the pharmacology of it is purely based on
its structure and subjective effect similarities to other
lysergamides.

Over the first few months of 2015, it came to be marketed as a
legal alternative to LSZ,
AL-LAD and LSD
through online research chemical vendors which are currently selling
the compound in the form of freely available blotter sheet tabs. It
is usually marketed as a research chemical which means that it is
sold legally but not meant for human consumption.

In terms of its chemistry, 1P-LSD is a member of the lysergamide family and is generally regarded as a psychedelic. It is analogous to LSD, featuring a propionyl group bound to the nitrogen of the indole group. It is homologous to ALD-52, which contains an acetyl group instead of the propionyl group bound to the same location.

In terms of its pharmacology, 1P-LSD acts as a 5-HT2A partial agonist. The psychedelic effects are believed to come from 1P-LSD’s efficacy at the 5-HT2A receptors. However, the role of these interactions and how they result 
in the psychedelic experience continues to remain elusive.

It has been theorized that 1P-LSD may be a prodrug to LSD.
 Despite this prevailing theory, however, it appears that this is likely
 untrue. It has both a shorter duration, subtly distinct subjective 
effects and an extremely close potency which are three things which are 
rarely associated with a prodrug (especially in combination).

The effects of 1P-LSD are almost identical to that of its close structural relative LSD with the differences being so minuscule they are almost negligible or primarily due to different responses within the tripper.

The effects listed below are based upon the [subjective effects index](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effects_index) and personal experiences of [PsychonautWiki](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki#Contributors). The listed effects will rarely if ever occur all at once but heavier 
dosages will increase the chances and are more likely to induce a full 
range of effects.

**Physical effects:**

The physical effects of 1P-LSD can be broken down into several components all of which progressively intensify proportional to dosage. 
These are described below and generally include:

- **[Spontaneous tactile sensations](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_tactile_sensations)**
 - The “body high” of 1P-LSD can be described as proportionally very 
intense in comparison to its accompanying visual and cognitive effects. 
It behaves as a euphoric, fast moving, sharp and location specific 
tingling sensation. For some, it is manifested spontaneously at 
different unpredictable points throughout the trip, but for most it 
maintains a steady presence that rises with the onset and hits its limit
 once the peak has been reached. At moderate to high doses of 1P-LSD, 
this sensation will usually hit its highest level and become so 
overwhelming that people may find themselves writhing on the floor in 
complete pleasure.
- **[Stimulation](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)**
 - In terms of its effects on the physical energy levels of the tripper,
 1P-LSD is usually considered to be very energetic and stimulating 
without being forced. For example, when taken in any environment it will
 usually encourage physical activities such as running, walking, 
climbing or dancing. In comparison, other more commonly used 
psychedelics such as psilocin are generally sedating and relaxed.
- **[Nausea](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea)**
 - Mild nausea is occasionally reported when consumed in moderate to 
high dosages and either passes instantly once the tripper has vomited or
 gradually fades by itself as the peak sets in.
- **[Tactile enhancement](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_enhancement)**
- **[Bodily control enhancement](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bodily_control_enhancement)**
- **[Salivation](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Salivation)**
- **[Increased heart rate](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate)**
- **[Pupil dilation](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pupil_dilation)**

**Cognitive effects:**

The cognitive effects of 1P-LSD can be broken down into several components all of which progressively intensify proportional to dosage. 
In comparison to other psychedelics such as psilocin, LSA and ayahuasca,
 1P-LSD is significantly more stimulating and fast paced in terms of the
 specific style of thought stream produced and contains a large number 
of potential effects.

The most prominent of these cognitive effects generally include:

- **[Current mind state enhancement](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Current_mind_state_enhancement)**
- **[Thought acceleration](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_acceleration)**
- **[Novelty enhancement](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Novelty_enhancement)**
- **[Time distortion](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Time_distortion)**
- **[Analysis enhancement](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Analysis_enhancement)**
- **[Personal bias suppression](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Personal_bias_suppression)**
- **[Conceptual thinking](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Conceptual_thinking)**
- **[Memory suppression](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Memory_suppression)** (ego death)
- **[Thought loops](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops)**
- **[Feelings of interdependent opposites](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Feelings_of_interdependent_opposites)**
- **[Delusions](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions)**
- **[Unity and interconnectedness](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Unity_and_interconnectedness)**
- **[Feelings of self-design](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Feelings_of_self-design)**
- **[Spirituality enhancement](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spirituality_enhancement)**
- **[Delineation of thought](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delineation_of_thought)**

**Visual effects:**

*Enhancements*

1P-LSD presents a full and complete array of visual enhancements which generally includes:

- **[Visual acuity enhancement](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_acuity_enhancement)**
- **[Colour enhancement](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_enhancement)**
- **[Pattern recognition enhancement](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition_enhancement)**

*Distortions*

1P-LSD presents a full and complete array of visual distortions which generally includes:

- **[Drifting](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting)** *([melting](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Melting), [breathing](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Breathing), [morphing](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Morphing) and [flowing](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Flowing))*
 - In comparison to other psychedelics, this effect can be described as 
highly detailed and cartoon-like in its appearance. The distortions are 
slow and smooth in motion and fleeting in their appearance.
- **[Tracers](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tracers)**
- **[Depth perception distortions](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depth_perception_distortions)**
- **[Symmetrical texture repetition](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Symmetrical_texture_repetition)**
- **[Colour shifting](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_shifting)**
- **[Perspective distortions](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perspective_distortions)**

[Geometry](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Geometry)

The visual geometry that is present throughout this trip can be described as more similar in appearance to that of 2C-B or 2C-I than psilocin, LSA or DMT. It can be comprehensively described through its [variations](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Geometry#Variations) as primarily intricate in complexity, algorithmic in form, unstructured
 in organization, brightly lit, colourful in scheme, synthetic in feel, 
multicoloured in scheme, flat in shading, sharp in edges, large in size,
 fast in speed, smooth in motion, angular in its corners, non-immersive 
in depth and consistent in intensity.

In the case of higher level geometry, this substance is [level 8A](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/8A_Geometry) dominant but is also capable of inducing [8B Geometry](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/8B_Geometry) under the right circumstances.

*Hallucinatory states*

1P-LSD is capable of producing a full range of low and high level hallucinatory states in a fashion that is significantly less consistent 
and reproducible than that of many other commonly used psychedelics. 
These effects include:

- **[Transformations](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Transformations)**
- **[Internal hallucinations](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucinations)** (*[Autonomous entities](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Autonomous_entities)*, *[Settings, sceneries, and landscapes](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Settings,_sceneries,_and_landscapes)*, *[Alterations in perspective](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alterations_in_perspective)* and *[Scenarios and plots](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenarios_and_plots)*) - Although 1P-LSD is technically capable of producing hallucinatory states in a fashion that is on par with psilocin or DMT
 in its vividness and intensity, these effects are rarer and more 
inconsistent in comparison. While traditional psychedelics such as LSA, ayahuasca and mescaline will induce internal hallucinations near consistently at level 5 [geometry](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Geometry) and above, 1P-LSD will for most simply go straight into [Level 8A](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/8A_Geometry)
 visual geometry. This lack of consistently induced hallucinatory 
breakthroughs means that for most, 1P-LSD is not quite as deep of an 
experience as certain other psychedelics. On the occasion that they are 
induced, however, they can be comprehensively described in terms of 
their [variations](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucinations#Variations) as lucid in believability, interactive in style, new experiences in content, autonomous in controllability and [geometry](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Geometry)-based in appearance.

**Auditory effects:**

The auditory effects of 1P-LSD are common in their occurrence and exhibit a full range of effects which commonly include:

- [Enhancements](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_enhancement)
- [Distortions](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_distortion)
- [Hallucinations](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_hallucination)

**Physical health effects, potential addiction and tolerance:**

The toxicity and long term health effects of recreational 1P-LSD use do not seem to have been studied in any scientific context and the exact
 toxic dosage is unknown. This is because 1P-LSD is a research chemical 
with very little history of human usage. Anecdotal evidence from people 
within the psychedelic community who have tried 1P-LSD suggests that 
there are no negative health effects attributed to simply trying this 
drug at low to moderate doses or using it very sparingly (but nothing 
can be completely guaranteed).

1P-LSD is non-habit forming and the desire to use it can actually decrease with use. It is most often self-regulating.

An almost immediate tolerance is built to 1P-LSD after ingestion,
 preventing one from experiencing its full effects more often than every
 4-7 days unless they increase their dose significantly.

**Legal issues:**

1P-LSD is currently a grey area compound within all parts of the world. This means that it is not known to be specifically illegal within
 any country, but that people may still be charged for its possession 
under certain circumstances such as under analogue laws and with the 
intent to sell or consume.

**Conclusion:**

In conclusion, 1P-LSD is an exciting new research chemical with little to no information regarding its existence within the formal scientific literature. In terms of the effects it produces, it is identical to LSD apart from a slightly shorter duration and is therefore an excellent and worthwhile alternative which is superior to that of LSZ and AL-LAD.

## Subjective Experience

When 1P-LSD appeared on the markets towards the end of 2014 it was immediately
recognised that its effects were identical, or near identical, to those of LSD itself.

This was also my experience. Thus, in logging my personal research, it is difficult,
perhaps impossible, to add a new perspective to the countless reports and
monologues that have been produced over the years. Instead, I will simply map
generic features and insights, rather than delve into the content or substance of any
single or specific trip.

As with most chemicals of this class, I procured the tabs directly from Lizard Labs,
which already had a reputation for bringing high quality and novel psychedelics to
the online market. IP-LSD was to become its most well known creation, and was
widely distributed through other vendors.

As usual with dosage, I started small and built up. In fact I started very small, with a
microdose.

Herein lies another dimension to this particular psychedelic: some people microdose
on a daily or regular basis. This is commonly claimed to enhance mental or visual
acuity or insight, to counter depression, to increase creativity or productivity, and so
forth.

That's an aside. My microdose tests were simply intended to dip my toe into the
water, to get a feel for the drug, and to gain some assurance regarding its quality and
safety.

As I built up the dose the experiences became richer and more influential. Music was
dramatically enhanced, as were computer visuals, and vision generally became more
interesting. There's something about the vibrancy of colouration on 1P-LSD or LSD
which seems to be a universal constant.

The headspace was always extremely pleasant, and a wonderful feeling of oneness
with the universe increased with dose. This is an aspect well worthy of focus in its
own right, as I found the same as virtually everyone else who has written on this
facet: specifically that nature is a truly wonderful place in which to experience it. I
frequently gazed around in astonishment, seeing, feeling, indeed witnessing, the
interconnectedness, of.... everything.

I recall, on one particular trip, stepping out into the garden during a warm sunny
evening. I was at one with nature, as the swarms swirled around plants and bushes,
all in perfect harmony. The sky was simply beautiful as clouds drifted effortlessly
across. At one point I lay horizontal on the grass and simply watched. Everything
evoked a sense of wonder, as I drank in an experience which was all around me.

Goodness knows what sort of spectacle I would have made had anyone been looking
through their window and witnessed my astonishment. It was a oneness that only
someone who has been there can possibly understand. I didn't just see it or hear it, I
was part of it, and actually felt the whole within myself.

This was an entirely different type of ego-shattering drama to the unfoldments of
ayahuasca, for example. It was beauty and bliss within its own boundless terms.

Words will always fail, and can never properly describe the quality or depths of the
sensations and perceptions which are unlocked. Indeed, I have experienced so many
beautiful moments, and I believe learned much, through the use of this remarkable
drug.

The onset of a typical 1P-LSD trip usually took about an hour, with indications that
changes were afoot beginning well before this. This was a gentle incline, barely
perceived during its early stages, with hints slowly manifesting here and there, and
steadily strengthening.

The duration was always lengthy, with the often quoted 8-12 hours not being far off
the mark. It should be noted that the peak was considerably shorter than this, and
fully functional control was always established well before the end.

Mild after effects of lassitude, and a feeling of being drained, sometimes persisted
into the next day. However, for me, these minor discomforts were always well worth
enduring, given the perceived positives and benefits which came with the overall
exercise.

## Reflection

There’s a neat video on YouTube, the chorus of which perfectly sums up the feeling I
experience following a 1P-LSD trip: “I wish I’d gone deeper but I’m not so brave”.

This is an unspoken desire to learn more, more quickly, by taking increasingly larger
doses. It is an intellectual challenge, tempered only by fear of the unknown, and the
length of the period of reduced social capacitation.

This innate curiosity and yearning to uncover mystery is what has driven me to
slowly push the boundaries, and indeed, to continue to explore this genre.

**1-Propionyl- *d* -lysergic acid diethylamide** (also known as **1P-LSD** ) is a novel [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) substance of the [lysergamide](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Lysergamides) class. It is structurally related to [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) and other novel lysergamides like [1cP-LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/1cP-LSD) , [1B-LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/1B-LSD) , and [1V-LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/1V-LSD) . It is thought to produce its effects by stimulating [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) [receptors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Receptors) in the brain, although the precise mechanism is not known.

1P-LSD has been sold online as a [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) (also called "designer drug") since 2015, but the original synthesis date of 1P-LSD is unknown. Unlike most [research chemicals](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemicals) , it has no documented record in the research literature before its emergence on the online research chemical market in 2015.

It was marketed as a legal alternative to [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) alongside other novel [lysergamides](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Lysergamides) like [ALD-52](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/ALD-52) , [ETH-LAD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/ETH-LAD) , and [AL-LAD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/AL-LAD) . In 2019, it became part of a group of molecules studied by the French laboratory Caulredaitens. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

[Subjective effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effects) include [geometric visual hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Geometry) , [time distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Time_distortion) , [enhanced introspection](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Introspection) , [conceptual thinking](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Conceptual_thinking) , [euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Euphoria) , and [ego loss](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ego_loss) . User reports indicate that the subjective effects of 1P-LSD are extremely similar to [those of LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD#Subjective_effects) . It is theorized to act as a [prodrug](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Prodrug) for LSD.

This hypothesis is supported by the results of a study that demonstrated 1P-LSD is metabolized to LSD in rats. This predicts a near-identical effect profile, likely differing mainly in its rate of absorption and duration. Its classical psychedelic effects and favorable tolerability has led it to become popular among novel substance users who use it interchangeably with LSD.

Very little data exists about the pharmacological properties, metabolism, and toxicity of 1P-LSD. It is presumed to have a similar toxicity and risk profile as [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) , although there are no formal studies that prove this. It is highly advised to use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Harm_reduction_practices) if using this substance.

## History and culture

1P-LSD first appeared on the online research chemical market in January 2015. Although it was likely discovered in an academic setting, it is unknown who first synthesized 1P-LSD, as the substance does not appear in any academic literature pre-dating its arrival on the research chemical market.

Interestingly, the future usage of 1-alkylated lysergamide derivatives as a means to bypass controlled substance laws banning [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) as a precursor was foreseen in a DEA report from 1988:

## Chemistry

1P-LSD is a semisynthetic compound of the [lysergamide](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Lysergamide) family. It is similar to [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) and is named for the propionyl group bound to the nitrogen of the polycyclic indole group of LSD. Propionyl consists of the carbonyl chain CH 3 CH 2 CO- bound to an amino group.

1P-LSD is homologous to [ALD-52](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/ALD-52) , which holds an acetyl group bound to the nitrogen instead of the propionyl group bound at the same location. The structure of 1P-LSD contains a polycyclic group featuring a bicyclic hexahydro indole bound to a bicyclic quinoline group. At carbon 8 of the quinoline, an N,N-diethyl carboxamide is bound.

## Pharmacology

Based on its structural similarity to LSD, 1P-LSD likely acts as a [partial agonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist#Agonists) at the [5-HT2A](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin#The_5-HT_system) receptor. The [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) effects are thought to primarily come from its efficacy at the 5-HT 2A receptors distributed throughout the brain.

1P-LSD also likely displays binding activity at a wide range of [monoamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Monoamine) receptors, such as those for [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) and [norepinephrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Norepinephrine) . However, there is currently no experimental data to support these claims.

It has been theorized that 1P-LSD may act as a [prodrug](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Prodrug) for [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) . While 1P-LSD shows only 38% the potency of LSD in mice, LSD is detected via LC-MS when 1P-LSD is incubated in human serum. Follow-up studies are currently being conducted to compare the affinity and selectivity of LSD and 1P-LSD at 5-HT receptors, and to determine whether 1P-LSD is hydrolyzed to LSD in vivo. Otherwise, it is possible that 1P-LSD possesses intrinsic activity.

Prior to the publishing of the above-cited research, medicinal chemist and psychedelics researcher [David E. Nichols](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/David_E._Nichols) reportedly commented on the potential 1P-LSD serotonin receptor binding dynamics in private correspondence:

A 2020 study on two human male volunteers found that the levels of 1P-LSD in the serum after administration quickly diminished within the first hour while LSD has been found consistently during the experiment, which further supports the prodrug theory. The study also found that LSD's bioavailability after oral ingestion of 1P-LSD was close to 100%.

## Subjective effects

Anecdotal reports from many users suggest that the subjective effects of 1P-LSD are so similar to that of [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) so as to be virtually indistinguishable from one another. In comparison to other psychedelics such as [psilocybin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocybin) , [LSA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSA) and [ayahuasca](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ayahuasca) , 1P-LSD is significantly more stimulating and fast-paced regarding the specific style of its physical and cognitive effects.

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)** - 1P-LSD is usually regarded as very energetic and stimulating without being forced. For example, when taken in any environment it will usually encourage physical activities such as running, walking, climbing or dancing. In comparison, other more commonly used psychedelics such as [psilocybin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocybin) which are generally sedating and relaxed.
- **[Spontaneous bodily sensations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_bodily_sensations)** - The "body high" of 1P-LSD can be characterized as proportionally very intense in comparison to its accompanying visual and cognitive effects. It behaves as a euphoric, fast-moving, sharp and location-specific tingling sensation. For some, it is manifested spontaneously at different, unpredictable points throughout the trip, but for most, it maintains a steady presence that rises with the onset and hits its limit once the peak has been reached. At moderate to high doses of 1P-LSD, this sensation often approaches its highest level and can become so overwhelming that people may find themselves debilitated with pleasurable sensations. 
- **[Physical euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria)** - It should be noted that this effect is not as reliably induceable as it is with substances like [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) or [entactogens](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entactogens) , and can just as easily manifest as extreme physical discomfort without any apparent reason.
- **[Tactile enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_enhancement)** - Feelings of enhanced tactile sensations are consistently present at moderate levels throughout most 1P-LSD experiences. If [level 8A geometry](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/8A_Geometry) is reached, an intense sensation of suddenly becoming aware of and being able to feel every single nerve ending across a person's entire body all at once is consistently present.
- **[Stamina enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stamina_enhancement)** - This is generally mild in comparison to the stamina enhancement produced by traditional [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) .
- **[Appetite suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Appetite_suppression)**
- **[Bodily control enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bodily_control_enhancement)**
- **[Difficulty urinating](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Difficulty_urinating)**
- **[Excessive yawning](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Excessive_yawning)** - This effect is significantly less pronounced than it is with [psilocybin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocybin) and its related compounds, the four-position [substituted tryptamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tryptamine#List_of_substituted_tryptamines) .
- **[Nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea)** - Mild nausea is occasionally reported when consumed in moderate to high dosages and either passes instantly soon after the user has vomited or gradually fades by itself as the peak sets in.
- **[Increased blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Increased heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Increased perspiration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_perspiration)**
- **[Muscle contractions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_contractions)**
- **[Muscle spasms](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_spasms)**
- **[Pupil dilation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pupil_dilation)**
- **[Increased salivation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_salivation)**
- **[Vasoconstriction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction)** - Vasoconstriction may lead to users feeling cold, especially in the extremities.
- **[Seizure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizure)** - The likelihood is largely extrapolated from the seizures that have been reported from the use of [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) . It is thought to mainly be a risk in those who are genetically predisposed to them, particularly while accompanied by physically taxing conditions such as states of dehydration, fatigue, undernourishment or overheating. ### Visual effects
 
- #### Enhancements
 
- **[Colour enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_enhancement)** - In comparison to other psychedelics, this effect is often reported to be brighter but not as varied in its character.
- **[Pattern recognition enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition_enhancement)**
- **[Visual acuity enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_acuity_enhancement)**
 
#### Distortions
 
- **[Drifting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_drifting)** *( [melting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_drifting#Melting) , [breathing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_drifting#Breathing) , [morphing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_drifting#Morphing) and [flowing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_drifting#Flowing) )* - In comparison to other psychedelics, this effect can be described as highly detailed yet cartoon-like in its appearance. The distortions are slow and smooth in motion and fleeting in their appearance.
- **[Colour shifting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_shifting)**
- **[Colour tinting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_tinting)**
- **[Tracers](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tracers)**
- **[After images](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/After_images)**
- **[Depth perception distortions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depth_perception_distortions)**
- **[Perspective distortions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perspective_distortions)**
- **[Recursion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Recursion)**
- **[Symmetrical texture repetition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Symmetrical_texture_repetition)**
- **[Scenery slicing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenery_slicing)**
 
#### Geometry
 
The visual geometry of 1P-LSD can be described as more similar in appearance to that of [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) or [2C-I](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-I) than [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) , [LSA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSA) or [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT) . It can be comprehensively described through its [variations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Geometry#Variations) as primarily intricate in complexity, algorithmic in form, unstructured in organization, brightly lit, colourful in scheme, synthetic in feel, multicoloured in scheme, flat in shading, sharp in edges, large in size, fast in speed, smooth in motion, angular in its corners, non-immersive in-depth and consistent in intensity.
 
In the case of higher-level geometry, this substance is [level 8A](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/8A_Geometry) dominant but is also capable of inducing [8B Geometry](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/8B_Geometry) under the right circumstances.
 
#### Hallucinatory states
 
1P-LSD is capable of producing a full range of hallucinatory states in a fashion that is significantly less consistent and reproducible than that of many other commonly used psychedelics, specifically tryptamines like [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT) or [psilocybin mushrooms](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocybin_mushrooms) . These effects include:
 
- **[Transformations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Transformations)**
- **[Machinescapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Machinescapes)** - This component is a rare effect that typically only occurs at very strong to heavy doses, and not as consistently as with notably visual psychedelics like [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT) , [ETH-LAD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/ETH-LAD) , and [2C-P](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-P) , and atypical psychedelics like [salvia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Salvia) .
- **[Internal hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucination)** ( *[autonomous entities](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Autonomous_entities)* ; *[settings, sceneries, and landscapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Settings,_sceneries,_and_landscapes)* ; *[perspective hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perspective_hallucinations)* and *[scenarios and plots](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenarios_and_plots)* ) - Although 1P-LSD is technically capable of producing hallucinatory states in a fashion that is on par with [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) or [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT) in its vividness and intensity, these effects are incredibly rare and inconsistent in comparison. While traditional psychedelics such as [LSA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSA) , [ayahuasca](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ayahuasca) and [mescaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mescaline) will induce internal hallucinations near consistently at level 5 [geometry](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Geometry) and above, 1P-LSD will for most simply go straight into [Level 8A](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/8A_Geometry) visual geometry. This lack of consistently induced hallucinatory breakthroughs means that for most, LSD is limited in depth. When they do occur, they can be described in terms of their [variations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Internal_hallucinations#Variations) as lucid in believability, interactive in style, new experiences in content, autonomous in controllability and [geometry](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Geometry) -based in appearance.
- **[External hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/External_hallucination)** ( *[autonomous entities](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Autonomous_entities)* ; *[settings, sceneries, and landscapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Settings,_sceneries,_and_landscapes)* ; *[perspective hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perspective_hallucinations)* and *[scenarios and plots](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenarios_and_plots)* ) ### Cognitive effects
 
- - **[Analysis enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Analysis_enhancement)** - This effect is consistent in its manifestation and [introspection](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Introspection) dominant.
- **[Anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety)** & **[Paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia)** - This effect is not as common at low to moderate doses and is less likely to occur when the basic rules of [set and setting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Set_and_setting) are taken into account. It should be noted that this inconsistently induced effect is seemingly more likely to manifest when used with [cannabis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cannabis) . This combination should be used with extreme caution if one is not experienced with psychedelics, meaning that the user should adequately pace themselves with a fraction of their usual amount. It is commonly reported that psychedelics can to a certain extent counteract some of the perceived mental cloudiness or intoxicating effects of THC causing the user to in turn use more cannabis than is needed which can often lead to an overwhelmingly anxious headspace or a ["bad trip"](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bad_trip) .
- **[Catharsis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Catharsis)**
- **[Conceptual thinking](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Conceptual_thinking)**
- **[Creativity enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Creativity_enhancement)**
- **[Emotion enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Emotion_enhancement)**
- **[Novelty enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Novelty_enhancement)**
- **[Personal bias suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Personal_bias_suppression)**
- **[Personal meaning enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Personal_meaning_enhancement)**
- **[Focus enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Focus_enhancement)** - This effect is experienced exclusively on low or [threshold](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dosage#Threshold) dosages and feels less forced than it does with [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) .
- **[Immersion enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Immersion_enhancement)**
- **[Suggestibility enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Suggestibility_enhancement)**
- **[Cognitive euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_euphoria)** - This component is, generally speaking less consistent and pronounced than it is with substances like [psilocybin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocybin) and [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) . The mental euphoria experienced on LSD is usually simply due to an enhancement of the user’s current psychological and emotional state coupled with its more regularly occurring effect, [physical euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria) .
- **[Delusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusion)**
- **[Déjà vu](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/D%C3%A9j%C3%A0_vu)**
- **[Ego replacement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ego_replacement)**
- **[Increased libido](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_libido)**
- **[Increased music appreciation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_music_appreciation)**
- **[Increased sense of humor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_sense_of_humor)** 
- **[Laughter fits](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Laughter_fits)** - This can manifest prominently during a 1P-LSD experience, particularly during the [come up](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Duration#Come_up) phase, often resulting in bouts of uncontrollable giggles and laughter that can form a feedback loop if around others who are also under the influence.
- **[Memory suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Memory_suppression)** 
- **[Ego death](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ego_death)**
- **[Thought acceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_acceleration)**
- **[Thought disorganization](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_disorganization)**
- **[Thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops)**
- **[Time distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Time_distortion)**
- **[Wakefulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness)** ### Auditory effects
 
- - **[Auditory enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_enhancement)**
- **[Auditory distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_distortion)**
- **[Auditory hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_hallucinations)** ### Multi-sensory effects
 
- - **[Synaesthesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Synaesthesia)** - In its fullest manifestation, this is a very rare and non-reproducible effect. Increasing the dosage can increase the likelihood of this occurring, but seems to only be a prominent part of the experience among those who are already predisposed to synaesthetic states. ### Transpersonal effects
 
- - **[Spirituality enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spirituality_enhancement)**
- **[Existential self-realization](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Existential_self-realization)**
- **[Unity and interconnectedness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Unity_and_interconnectedness)**
### Combination effects

- **[Alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol)** - Alcohol's central depressant effects can be used to reduce some of the anxiety and tension produced by 1P-LSD. However, alcohol can cause [dehydration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dehydration) , [nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea) and [physical fatigue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_fatigue) which can negatively impact the direction of the trip. Users are advised to pace themselves and drink a portion of their usual amount.
- **[Benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines)** - Benzodiazepines are highly effective at reducing the intensity of 1P-LSD's effects through the general suppression of brain activity.
- **[Cannabis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cannabis)** - Cannabis strongly intensifies the sensory and cognitive effects of 1P-LSD. Extreme caution is advised when using this combination as it can significantly increase the chances of a negative psychological reaction like [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [confusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Confusion) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) . Users are advised to start off with only a fraction of their usual cannabis dose and take long breaks between hits to avoid over intake.
- **[Dissociatives](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociatives)** - 1P-LSD enhances the cognitive, visual and general hallucinatory effects of dissociatives. Dissociative-induced [holes, spaces, and voids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_disconnection#Holes.2C_spaces_and_voids) and [internal hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucinations) become more vivid and intense on 1P-LSD. These effects correspond with an increased risk of [confusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Confusion) , [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) , and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) .
- **[MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA)** - 1P-LSD and MDMA are highly synergistic and mutually enhance each other's physical, cognitive, and visual effects. The synergy between these substances is unpredictable, and it is advised to start with markedly lower doses than one would take for each individually. There is some evidence that suggests LSD increases the neurotoxicity of MDMA, which may be relevant to 1P-LSD as well.
- **[Psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics)** - When used in combination with other psychedelics, 1P-LSD's physical, cognitive, visual, auditory, and transpersonal effects intensify and synergize strongly. If choosing to combine psychedelics, it is recommended to start with significantly lower dosages than one would take for either substance individually
- **[Stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants)** - Combined with psychedelics, stimulants can cause severe *''' [Anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , *''' [Panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) , *''' [Thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops) , and*''' [Paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) .

## Toxicity and harm potential

The toxicity and long-term health effects of recreational 1P-LSD use have not been studied. This is because 1P-LSD is a [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) with almost no history of human use.

Anecdotal reports suggest that there are no negative health effects attributed to simply trying 1P-LSD by itself, at low to moderate doses, and using it very sparingly (although nothing can be completely guaranteed). [Independent research](https://www.google.com/) should always be conducted to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe before consumption.

Based on its similarity to LSD, 1P-LSD is assumed to be physiologically well-tolerated with a extremely low toxicity relative to dose. There are relatively few physical side effects that have been reported following acute 1P-LSD exposure.

However, as with LSD and psychedelics in general, it is likely that 1P-LSD can act as a trigger for those with underlying mental disorders. Those with a personal or family history of mental illness are generally advised not to use this substance, particularly when outside of a supervised medical setting.

It is strongly recommended that one uses [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this substance.

### Overdose

1P-LSD has no known toxic dose. However, higher doses increase the risk of adverse psychological reactions. These reactions include [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) and, more rarely, [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) . Medical attention is usually not needed except in the case of severe psychotic episodes or the ingestion of [fake acid](/w/index.php?title=Fake_acid&action=edit&redlink=1) (such as [25i-NBOMe](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25i-NBOMe) or [DOB](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DOB) ). Administration of [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) or [antipsychotics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antipsychotics) can help to relieve the acute negative cognitive effects of 1P-LSD.

### Dependence and abuse potential

Although no formal studies have been conducted, it is assumed that like LSD itself, 1P-LSD is non-addictive with a low abuse potential. There are no literature reports of successful attempts to train animals to self-administer LSD — an animal model predictive of abuse liability — indicating that it does not have the necessary pharmacology to either initiate or maintain dependence. Likewise, there is virtually no withdrawal syndrome when chronic use of LSD is stopped. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] It is assumed that 1P-LSD shares these properties with LSD.

Tolerance to the effects of 1P-LSD is built almost immediately after ingestion. After that, it takes about 5-7 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 14 days to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). 1P-LSD produces cross-tolerance with all [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) , meaning that after the use of 1P-LSD they will have a reduced effect.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

The following substances are listed on the assumption that 1P-LSD possesses a similar if not the same dangerous interactions profile as [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) , and may include more due to its status as an unstudied [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) .

- **[Lithium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_(medication))** - Lithium is commonly prescribed for the treatment of [bipolar disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder) . There is a large body of anecdotal evidence that suggests taking it with [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) significantly increases the risk of [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) and [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) . As a result, this combination is strictly discouraged.
- **[Cannabis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cannabis)** - Cannabis may have an unexpectedly strong and unpredictable synergy with the effects of 1P-LSD. Caution is advised with this combination as it can significantly increase the risk of adverse psychological reactions like [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) , and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) . Users are advised to start off with only a fraction of their normal cannabis dose and take long breaks between hits to avoid unintentional overdose.
- **[Stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants)** - Stimulants like [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) , [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) or [methylphenidate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylphenidate) affect many parts of the brain and alter [dopaminergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) function. This combination can increase the risk of [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) , and [thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops) . This interaction may also result in an elevated risk of [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) . [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol)** - Tramadol is well-documented to lower the seizure threshold and [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) may act to trigger seizures in susceptible individuals. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

## Legal status

1P-LSD is not scheduled under the UN Convention on Psychotropic Substances. It is considered to exist in a legal grey area in many countries, meaning that while it is not specifically illegal, individuals may still be charged for its possession under certain circumstances such as under analogue laws and with the intent to sell or consume.

- **Austria** : 1P-LSD is technically not illegal but it may fall in the NPSG (Neue-Psychoaktive-Substanzen-Gesetz Österreich) as an analogue of LSD, thus making it illegal to supply for human consumption.
- **Canada** : 1P-LSD is not mentioned in the *Controlled Drugs and Substances Act* , so it is technically not illegal. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **Czech Republic** : 1P-LSD is a controlled substance as of January 1, 2014.
- **Denmark** : As of August 25, 2015, 1P-LSD is specifically named on the list of illegal substances.
- **Estonia** : 1P-LSD is an ainete I ( *Schedule I* ) controlled substance as of June 1, 2017.
- **Finland** : 1P-LSD is a controlled substance as of November 15, 2018.
- **Germany** : 1P-LSD is controlled under the NpSG ( *New Psychoactive Substances Act* ) as of July 18, 2019. Production and import with the aim to place it on the market, administration to another person and trading is punishable. Possession is illegal but not penalized.
- **Japan** : 1P-LSD is a controlled substance.
- **Latvia** : 1P-LSD is illegal in Latvia. Although it is not officially scheduled, it is controlled as an LSD structural analog due to an amendment made on June 1, 2015.
- **Lithuania** : 1P-LSD is illegal in Lithuania and is specifically named on the list of illegal substances since September 21, 2015.
- **Norway** : 1P-LSD is a controlled substance as of February 14, 2013.
- **Romania** : 1P-LSD is a controlled substance.
- **Singapore** : 1P-LSD is a Class A controlled substance.
- **Sweden** : Following its sale as a [designer drug](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Designer_drug) , 1P-LSD was made illegal in Sweden on January 26, 2016.
- **Switzerland** : 1P-LSD is a controlled substance specifically named under Verzeichnis E. It is illegal as of December 2015.
- **Turkey** : 1P-LSD is illegal in Turkey as of February 2016.
- **United Kingdom** : 1P-LSD is illegal to produce, supply, or import under the Psychoactive Substance Act, which came into effect on May 26, 2016.
- **United States** : 1P-LSD is unscheduled in the United States of America. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] Since 1P-LSD can be considered a prodrug for LSD, its possession and sale may be prosecutable in the United States under the Federal Analogue Act.
- **Italy:** 1P-LSD is a schedule I drug (Tabella 1).

*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1P-LSD*

1P-LSD, also known as 1-propionyl-LSD, is a psychedelic drug of the lysergamide family related to LSD. It is an ester derivative of LSD and a homologue of ALD-52 (1A-LSD). The drug originated in 2015 when it appeared as a designer drug sold online. It was first synthesized as a legal LSD alternative by Lizard Labs, a Netherlands based research chemical laboratory. It modifies the LSD molecule by adding a propionyl group to the nitrogen atom of LSD's indole group and is a prodrug of LSD.

## Use and effects

The dose range of 1P-LSD is 100 to 200 μg, with a typical dose estimate of 150 μg. Its duration is about 8 to 12 hours for most people. The subjective effects of 1P-LSD are not well-defined in the literature, although they are generally thought to be comparable to those of LSD. In a 2020 study, the qualitative effects of 1P-LSD and LSD were similar when measured using visual analog scales. The properties of 1P-LSD have also been assessed in other studies.

## Interactions

## Pharmacology

Like ALD-52 (1A-LSD), 1P-LSD is believed to act as a prodrug for LSD via hydrolysis of the propionyl group. When 1P-LSD is incubated in human serum or liver cells, administered intravenously to rats, or administered either orally or intravenously to human subjects, high levels of LSD and relatively low levels of 1P-LSD are quickly detected, demonstrating that 1P-LSD is rapidly hydrolyzed into LSD in vivo following ingestion. Indeed, following intravenous administration in humans 1P-LSD is detectable in serum for no longer than 4 hours, after which it is completely converted to LSD. These findings are supported by the similar duration and behavioral effects of 1P-LSD and LSD in both animal and human experiments.

## Chemistry

### Synthesis

The chemical synthesis of 1P-LSD has been described in a patent from 2024.

### Properties

The chemical stability of 1P-LSD has been studied.

### Analogues

Related compounds include 1cP-LSD, 1B-LSD, 1D-LSD, 1V-LSD, ALD-52 (1A-LSD), 1cP-AL-LAD, AL-LAD, ETH-LAD, 1P-ETH-LAD, PRO-LAD, LSM-775, and LSZ, among others.

## History

1P-LSD was first described as well as encountered as a novel designer drug in 2015.

## Society and culture

### Legal status

As of 2015, 1P-LSD is unscheduled in the United States and Canada, but may be considered illegal if sold or used for human consumption as a structural analog of LSD under the Federal Analogue Act in the US. 1P-LSD is a prohibited or controlled substance in Australia, France, Finland, Denmark, Germany, Estonia, Japan, Latvia, Norway, Romania, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, Italy, Singapore, the Czech Republic, and Croatia. 1P-LSD has been illegal in Russia since 2017 as an LSD derivative.
