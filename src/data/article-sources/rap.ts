## Subjective Experience

Rapé appeared on the UK market just a few months prior to the blanket ban on
psychoactives in 2016. I wrote the following forum post at the time:

\`\`\`
In recent weeks I have noticed a couple of websites suddenly offering this in
the UK. It is a type of snuff, which the most prominent vendor states is “a
complex blend of pulverized plants, which usually contain a strong tobacco”.
Instead of regular tobacco (nicotiana tabacum) it tends to be based around a
much stronger cousin, nicotiana rustica.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
Rapé is prevalent around the Amazon basin. It is used as a shamanic
medicine, and is occasionally offered during ayahuasca and other sacred
ceremonies.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
Independently, nicotiana rustica also has a very long history of ritual use. Its
effects are rather different to those of the manufactured version of tobacco, as
pimped on the high street. They broadly include a strong stimulation, a head
rush, and greater focus, with a lengthy sedation occurring later.
\`\`\`

\`\`\`
The reason I post this now relates to timing. It speculatively occurs to me that
these vending initiatives may be a direct or indirect response to the
forthcoming ban on psychoactives: tobacco will remain legal, and these
substances may therefore remain openly available.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
Whether this is a positive or not, it is important that harm reduction is
considered early in the fray. There is very little information available with
respect to this, but hopefully this post can start the ball rolling.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
I have experimented previously with both nicotiana rustica and a couple of
rapé variants. They can certainly pack a punch, and not necessarily a positive
one.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
In the indigenous environment the snuff is blown into the nostril by a partner,
in a similar manner to that practised for yopo seeds. However, self-
administration tools are also available, in the form of a sort of V-shaped
bamboo tubing, called a kuripe.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
The effect can also be induced via a very strong snort. This is a central matter,
as the intensity of the experience is closely linked to both the amount taken
and the strength of the blow (or inhalation).
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
I have remained cautious with this substance partly because tobacco itself is
addictive and harmful. I don’t smoke, and don’t want to. Bearing in mind that
nicotiana rustica is frequently cited as being about 20 times more powerful
than nicotiana tabacum you can probably see my point. It may or may not
present a significantly higher risk of addiction, but I have never felt inclined to
take the chance.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
The other issue that concerns me is the recurrent claim that large doses (of
nicotiana rustica) can cause acute nicotine poisoning and death. This sort of
comment, found on drugs-forum.com, can’t be ignored:
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
“I've never heard of anyone doing this outside of various Central/
South American tribal shamans. These people systematically addict
themselves to tobacco and develop tolerances that are staggering, so
that they are able to ingest what would be lethal doses for most
people. And even these shamans have been known to OD and wind up
dead as a sacrifice to their art.” ~ rawbeer
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
I’m not trying to put a damp cloth on this, or generally undermine it, but
clearly, caution is advisable.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
Also relevant is that it is usually extremely hard to uncover exactly what is in
most of the rapé variants, including their actual nicotiana rustica content.
Having stated all this, it should be noted that there are versions of rapè that
don’t contain nicotine, although I have not personally encountered them.
\`\`\`

\`\`\`
If anyone can add to this starter in any way please do so. Rapé provides a
definite and strong psychoactive effect, and my hunch is that it will become
much more widely used in the short term.
\`\`\`
Regarding content, the vendor of my particular samples stated that rapé can contain
alkaloid ashes, which can be “made from psychoactive plants” and in some cases
hallucinogens. Given its historical and ritual use this is undoubtedly true, although I
cannot confirm this with respect to my own experiments.

In addition to the recreational aspects I have focused upon above, and as also stated
in the post itself, rapé has long been used for medicinal purposes, usually in a
traditional sacred context. Clearly, the specific plants used in a particular rapé
variant will determine its individual effects. The scope is obviously enormous.

As for my experience, whilst hard hitting, with something of a head shock, rapé was
similar to but nothing like as debilitating as standalone nicotiana rustica. However,
with a strong enough snort/blow perhaps it could be. Further information on
nicotiana rustica itself is provided under the heading of Mapacho, earlier in this
section.

There are clearly certain subtleties with rapé in terms of its different versions and
ingredients, but I suspect that for many these will only manifest themselves with
repeated or prolonged exposure to the tobacco. For the tobacco smoker this may
provide an interesting field of (cautious) research.

ADDENDUM
Some years subsequent to writing the above, and having read a couple of positive
reports, I revisited rapé via another standalone experiment.

I prepared 2 pea sized doses of finely ground yawanawa powder and embarked at
approximately 4:20 pm. In traditional style I blew the first up my left nostril using a
kuripe, and despite gasping with watering eyes managed to repeat with the left.

I was hit immediately. Following on from the severe olfactory discomfort, heat
quickly engulfed my brain/head, top down, and a debilitating and not very pleasant
headspace emerged. The burning sensation drifted into what almost felt like an
illness or flu. I tried to meditate into it and confront it but it was too unpleasant. It
was overwhelming and I stumbled to bed, sweating profusely.

There were mapacho-like aspects to this, which was not surprising, although it was
not quite as intense. Ten minutes passed and I lay there feeling poorly and quite
wretched. After half an hour I was a little better but still unwell. An hour later I was
finally able to rise. I slowly recovered but was not in a good condition for the rest of
the day.

Clearly, such tobacco based materials are not for me, and I certainly won’t be
repeating this.

  "wikipedia": `# Nicotiana rustica
*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotiana_rustica*

Nicotiana rustica, commonly known as Aztec tobacco or strong tobacco, is a rainforest plant in the family Solanaceae native to South America.  It is a very potent variety of tobacco, containing up to nine times more nicotine than common species of Nicotiana such as Nicotiana tabacum (common tobacco). More specifically, N. rustica leaves have a nicotine content as high as 9%, whereas N. tabacum leaves contain about 1 to 3%. The high concentration of nicotine in its leaves makes it useful for producing pesticides, and it has a wide variety of uses specific to cultures around the world. However, N. rustica is no longer cultivated in North America (except in small quantities by certain Native American tribes) as N. tabacum has replaced it.

## Uses

### South America

Nicotiana rustica is called mapacho in South America. It is often used for entheogenic purposes by South American shamans, because of the comparatively high levels of harmala alkaloids and nicotine. There are many methods of administration in South American ethnobotanical preparations. In a preparation known as singado or singa, N. rustica is allowed to soak or be infused in water, and the water is then insufflated. In Peru it is known as "Mapacho" and is smoked in pipes or drunk as a juice. The plant can also be smoked in cigars, administered as an enema, and made into a lickable product known as ambil. Finally, N. rustica is a common ingredient in rapé, a smokeless tobacco product usually used as a nasal snuff. (See also Göteborgs Rapé.)  Rapé is often a combination of N. rustica and a host of other herbs, depending on the intended use, including tonka beans, cinnamon, clove buds, soda ash (creating nu-nu), Anadenanthera, Erythroxylum, Virola, and more. In Amazonian traditions, rapé is a finely powdered nasal snuff typically prepared from the leaves of Nicotiana rustica mixed with ashes derived from the bark of particular tree species. The dried ingredients are pounded and filtered to produce a very fine dust. Varieties of N. rustica used include “corda”, “moi”, and in some contexts fermented mapacho. Due to its high nicotine content—often several times greater than Nicotiana tabacum—rapé is considered potent and is used ritually for its grounding and focusing effects. The choice of tree ashes and additional plant ingredients varies among different groups and is often specific to individual tribes.

### Russia

In Russia, N. rustica is called makhorka (маxорка). Historically, makhorka was smoked mainly by the lower classes. N. rustica is a hardy plant and can be grown in most of Russia (as opposed to other Nicotiana species which require a warm climate), it was more readily and cheaply available, and did not depend on transport in a country with an underdeveloped road network and climatic portage problems. This remained the case until cultivated tobacco became widely available in the 20th century.
During Soviet times, rustic tobacco was an important industrial crop of agriculture. In those times, dozens of varieties were bred, some of them considered equal in quality to cultivated tobacco. In modern times, makhorka is still sometimes smoked by peasants and farmers due to its high availability and being almost free for them.

### Vietnam

The plant is called Thuốc lào in Vietnam, and is most commonly smoked after a meal on a full stomach to "aid in digestion", or along with green tea or local beer (most commonly the cheap bia hơi). A "rít" of thuốc lào is followed by a flood of nicotine to the bloodstream inducing strong dizziness that lasts several seconds. Heavy cigarette smokers have had trouble with the intense volume of smoke and the high nicotine content; side effects include nausea and vomiting.
There are many "brands" of tobacco, most of which are specific to the region in which they are grown. Some of these "brands" are mellow in flavor and effect, some are more energizing, and some are known for their relaxing properties.
Water pipes can be found everywhere, and are a fixture of local tea booths, eateries, and cafes. It is common to find a table with a small box of tobacco at these establishments from which anyone can help themselves to a bowl during a tea or work break.
The main difference between smoking thuốc lào and the use of other tobaccos is in the method of consumption, in that thuốc lào is consumed with a water pipe. The smoker is presented with either a bamboo pipe called a điếu cày (English: "farmer's pipe") or a ceramic hookah called a điếu bát. It may also occasionally be smoked in a more uncommon pipe known as a điếu ống. The pipe is filled with an appropriate amount of water and a small amount of thuốc lào is pressed into the bowl.

One then ignites the tobacco and inhales to create a body of smoke inside the pipe, before exhaling the smoke, reversing the process of air in the pipe by blowing into it to pop out the tobacco. The smoker then sharply inhales, usually tilting the pipe upwards to an almost horizontal position (but not completely, as the water would drain into the mouth).

### Turkey

Maraş otu (English: Maraş weed) is a chewing variant of Nicotiana rustica commonly used by people who live in Maraş, Turkey and other areas of the country. Maraş Otu is a mixture of Oak tree ash and Nicotiana rustica that resembles henna.  They use this by putting the mixture under their lips like Swedish snus or Afghan naswar. It is recognized as a drug by anti-drug activists. It can contribute to mouth cancers.

### Sudan

In Sudan, this type of tobacco is called toombak (Arabic: توومباك).  It has been used for over 400 years. Being a form of smokeless tobacco, the tobacco leaves are cured, dried, ground and then mixed with sodium bicarbonate. As such, the freebase nicotine in this product is highly addictive.

## Ecology

Nicotiana rustica serves as a larval host plant for Chrysodeixis includens and Phthorimaea operculella. Known pollinators of Nicotiana rustica include: Augochlorella aurata, Lasioglossum perpunctatum, Bombus impatiens, Lasioglossum tegulare, Augochlora pura, Lasioglossum michiganense, Lasioglossum versans, Bombus vagans, Halictus ligatus, Lasioglossum oblongum, Halictus rubicundus, Megachile frigida, and Sphecodes heraclei.
