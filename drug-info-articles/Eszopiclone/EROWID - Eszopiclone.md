## Overview

Zopiclone is a short-acting sedative-hypnotic medication used for short-term insomnia treatment. It belongs to a drug class called cyclopyrrolones and operates on similar receptor sites as benzodiazepines. The medication became available in Europe in 1989 and in the U.S. as eszopiclone (its active S-isomer) in 2005.
