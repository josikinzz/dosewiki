While mindfuck is a silly term, it can be given a meaning, and is a valid way of describing the effects of a drug.  I would say that if your brain is running so fast that your thoughts create anxiety, the drug has a "mindfuck" factor.  For me, 4-acetoxy-DET has interesting visuals with less "I'm going fucking crazy" feeling than mushrooms.

BTW, to me on the surface 4-AcO-DET is very mushroom-like but with several important differences.  It does have a mushroom-like feel to it.  I get the yawns, and it is somewhat sedating.  But 4-AcO-DET never lasts any longer than 4 hours, unlike mushrooms which can last up to 6.  4-AcO-DET is not as visual, and it doesn't have the same mental properties.  It feels more like a chemical, and seems to offer me less cosmic revelations than mushrooms do.  4-AcO-DET also seems to produce an anxiety reaction in me.  I don't notice it much if I keep my mind busy, but the underlining tension is always there.

4-AcO-DET is enjoyable to take on a hike in the mountians, or for an evening in bed with your girlfriend, but I don't consider it much of a healing substance, or one I take when I have serious issues to work on like I look to mushrooms for.

nice reply, mgs. I have a few things to add about 4-aco-det. I sampled this drug last night for the third or fourth time in combination with a dose of mushrooms. For me, the nausea I get from a high dose of decently potent mushrooms (~4 grams - +4 trip) affects me so harshly, i.e. gas, cramping, bloating, etc, during and after the trip, that it makes it hard and oftentimes unenjoyable to trip this hard. I needed an out from this uncomfortableness, so turned to 4-aco-det for experimentation.

There are signifigant differences in the feel of a psilocybin trip and a 4-aco-det trip. Some people may argue that it is silly to label mushrooms as more mystical and cosmic than 4-aco-det. The reason that it is found naturally in plants and was not synthesized MAY have some pyschosomatic effects on the tripper, but the fact remains that mushrooms ARE more mystical and cosmic, whether or not one of the reasons is that it is found naturally, and 4-aco-det is not. Maybe it's just coincidence, that my psilocybin trips have been deeper, less "chemical" feeling than my 4-aco-det trips. I will almost definitely not know why this is, perhaps for the best.

The point remains at least, that if you do suffer from nausea from psilocybin, then you might think about giving a psilocybin/4-aco-det combination a try. At least for me, there was very little feeling of the drugs "battling" with each other that is often reported from other RC combinations. It was very smooth and agreeable mix.

A combo I've found to work well is 10-12 mgs of 4-aco-det, and 1-1.5 grams of psilocybe mushrooms, produces a moderately intense trip. And as with all RCs, BE CAREFUL, dosage for these chemicals IS NOT set in stone, and varies tremendously.

Well I find 4-aco-det and mushrooms only remotely similar..  I'll say that of all other drugs I've tried 4-aco-det is the closest to mushrooms but thats about it..

Mushrooms seem to connect me to the "gaia mindspace" or whatever you'd call it, they are very "interactive" and right take control over my mind.  The trip is ususally freaky at time and changes course dramatically as well sometimes without warning.  Feeli like I'm everywhere at once or something, that my mind has connected to some all-encompassing cosmic energy field..

The body buzz/high with mushrooms is also way more pronounced and unique, feel like I'm made of jello but with this intense buzzing throughout the whole of my body, especially during the first 2 hours...

The 4-aco-det seems much more sterile and friendlier, more straightforwar.  Much better visuals I get from 4-aco-det, and my functioning is not much impaired....

^^^ I have to agree, to an extent, 4-aco-det does seem to give off a more controlled trip, etc. That said, a high dose of 4-aco-det is VERY intense. For me, 21mgs will produce an almost overwhelmingly intense trip.

4AcO-DET is a wonderful substance that i find to be far superior to Psilocybin or 4AcO-DiPT and is short acting a plus for when you need a clear head within a few hours but want to do a little psychedelic work before hand. Also its effects are very similar to Psilocybin but of a shorter duration and has its own color one that i find much more useful than Psilocybin and it does'nt cause the brain to feel overloaded and complex like it does on Psilocybin so i'd say that 4AcO-DET is unique and productive in its effects for me atleast.

4AcO-DET is wonderful and similar to psilocybin but you can tell there are differences like a more stimulated feeling with less visuals and more body effects. 4AcO-DET also is a little shorter which can be good and but i find psilocybin more enjoyable but 4AcO-DET can be fantastic however psilocybin comes out on top by just a tiny bit when it comes to euphoria and the intense colorful visuals.

In case anyone is wondering, 4-AcO-DET is simply the acetate ester of 4-Ho-DET.  I have had them both and could not tell them apart.

Id head over to Erowid if I were you, Im almost positive I saw a report about smoking 4-aco-det.  I dont think it had positive results, they reported being rather uncomfortable, but hey, you never know.  


Smoking might be a possible alternative method worth looking into.  But beware, little is known about this drug, so dont go playing hero and take huge doses.  Start small and work your way up.  Youll find your dose.


If you do try smoking (or snorting) or anything, please let us know, as it would be quite interesting to here to results.


But please be careful.

I've smoked 4-AcO-DET and to be honest, it's not a whole lot different than eating it.  It just comes on faster and ends faster.  The major effects are done within an hour when it is smoked.  It comes on fast, but there isn't really a rush like with DMT and 5-MeO-DMT.  Personally I'd just stick to eating it.  Works fine that way.

4 acetoxy-N,N-Diethyltryptamine is a wonderfully euphoric and erotic substance---IM at around the 30-40 mg dose is quite the "bardo" range of exploration w/o an overwhelming edge--I hit it and head straight for the hot-tub and stare at the trees and the sky or moonlight---delightful with music and close friends

^^^^^^^^^^


I would imagine that dose varies from person to person.  I find 16 mg *orally* to be plenty.  I see no need to IM it, much less take that much at a time.  Start out low on this one.

Ethacetin is not really like psilocybin for me - ethacetin has some good points; clear thinking vision, short duration, body high & euphoric/positive but it's not a personal favourite & I find it somewhat sharp & stimulating

I have never had the chance to try muchsrooms but my two experiences with 4-AcO-DET sound absolutely *nothing* like what people describe mushrooms. There are hardly any visuals, it is rather stimulating, and I find it very hard to believe that anyonecould laugh or have a "blissful" experience with 4-AcO-DET. THat is not to say that it is a bad substance - it is a very good teacher. I will post my recent experience with 4-AcO-DET when I am done typing it.

Yeah, some of the 4-AcO-DET that was circulating did turn out to contain 4-Ho-DET, as well as several other previously unknown tryptamines.  But I know what I had was 4-AcO-DET (this was years ago, and I only got a 50mg sample) was run through GC/MS analysis.  But that's neither here nor there.


As for them being interchangable or not, I must admit I've never taken more than 20mg of 4-AcO-DET, never went higher than 16mg with 4-Ho-DET (ethocin), and found 16mg of either usually more than sufficient for me to get a plus-three trip.  So I guess I should clarify and say that at dosages between 12mg and 20mg ethocin and its acetate seem interchangable to me.


I get weird body body vibrations with ethocin and its acetate though.  One time I had temors bordering on being seizures.  And since I find this one "lacking" a bit compared to iprocin, miprocin, and mushrooms (say that three times in a row) I doubt I'll ever take ethocin again.  So I will never know what 30mg trips are like.  I can't imagine them as I get blown away with 16mg!  ![8o](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eek.gif)  Must be incredible at those levels.


Though I must admit I never found ethocin to be the nicest psychedelic.  I've never felt any kind of fear with iprocin, which I've taken to the 26mg level.  But ethocin trips have usually produced a lot of generalized anxiety.  I'll stick with iprocin and psilocin mushrooms.  And from my one low dose try, miprocin sure seems good too.

I get the total opposite.  I've never felt (or heard from friends whom I share them with) that mushrooms trips lean towards a "dark side."  I do see a little of this "darkness" though in ethocin and its acetate.

^^^ I was just going to post the same.  With mushrooms, I never really experience a "dark side", yes in the past I have gotten a needed ass-whopping, which I could see some people calling a 'bad trip' but really those are the 'best' trips, when you really get something out of it.  By the way, after I tried mushroom 'tea', a big ass cup of nice tasting slightly honey or chocolate flavored water with all the goodies in there, I think thats the way i'll do it in the future.  Not because of any nausea or taste issues with mushrooms, as I can just sit and casually chew on them while talking, whatever, like they really do taste "good" now.  But its a nice way to slow the 'come up', make it nice and smooth, and you can consume exactly the right dose to get to your level you want, and just sip every now and then to stay where you want.


I noticed a LOT more of the jitters, general anxiety, with 4-ho-det than ever with mushrooms.  Visually I can see similarities but mentally it never did anything for me, really nothing like mushrooms at all like that for me.


Now 4-aco-mipt, that stuff is so good on the body at any dose i've tried (I think just up to 30mg orally).  I notice the color change is similar to mushrooms, somewhat visually although its got its 'own flavor', and it also tends to make me 'giggly' although not as much as muchrooms, but throughout the trip, I find a lot more things "extra funny" - if i'm reading something, hearing something, just regular things, somehow seem more humorous.

As for 4-AcO-DET, I agree with the above posts in that is is definitely grim. Grim is the only word I can use for it (but it is still a good teacher). I also get sickly tremors with it as well.


In my experience, It "feels" as if your body is vibrating. Sometimes it does, sometimes its just psychosomatic. IMO, with medicines  like DPT, the tremors are actually appreciated as part of the trip - they are "in tune" with it... hard to describe. But with 4-AcO-DET, the tremors are "dirty". Sometimes the tremors express themselves as teeth chattering.

Are there any after-effects at the end of the 4-aco-det trip? What about the next day, do you feel totally normal or a little off?

After a +3, perhaps even a +4 experience I have said goodbye to the wonderful chemical.


Its a good teacher. Work with it and respect it. I believe this chemical has much to give to certain people. 


At doses 7 - 12mg brings enhanced body sensations and an opening of the emotions. 12-20 gives a full psychedelic maelstrom.


20+ Seems to be similar to 12-20 but with much longer lasting effects. 4hours full experience with another 4 hours+ of tailend.


All the best with your adventures. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

With 14mg, acetate ester, free base:

"Came on in about an hour.  Totally avisual, with pleasant conversation and an excellent body feeling.  The stomach was a little twingy though, and I had the jitters.  Nice walk around the lake.  Cappucino was superb.  I was down and out in about 3 or 4 hours, which was a good, short duration.  Overall a very pleasant and euphoric experience."


With 13mg, acetate ester, free base:

"First effects took place in about 20 minutes or so, and it seemed a fair lot like a more clear headed version of a few glasses of wine until about t+1:20.  I came upon a hill and gazed at the sky, and felt incredibly euphoric, if not orgasmic.  What followed was about a 2 hour plateau, filled with mild-moderate visuals and at times a strong sense of depersonalization, almost to the point of being out of body.  At times it was a little frightening.  Once I got through the rough plateau, I went to a small party with some friends and found my ego inflated and overextended -- I had become a supreme narcissist.   The effects tapered down for a few more hours and in the end I'm left with a fair amount of self-loathing and a lot of personal questions.  This is not entirely the same as the free phenol, but similar.  On the positive side, the body felt mostly fine the whole experience."

I got very powerful effects from smoking this as the base...15mg would produce a +3 starting in a few minutes and lasting a good hour or so.  Effects were strong, but not very useful or interesting.  16mg orally produced a much better psychedelic state...full +3 but much gentler and longer lasting than when smoked.  I by far prefered to take this psychedelic orally...but in the end I really didn't care for ethocin or the acetate.  Iprocin is where it is at for me.

Awww, this poor B&D thread is so tiny now. Does anyone have anything they would like to add about this chemical?

Heh, I forgot all about it.


I just noticed my old (clearly intoxicated) posts here ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)


I never took that drug again after those posts. At the time I made them, the powder was beige and sandy. Now, it is black and muddy. However, a friend has taken a sample of this last year and loved it - I expect the potency has not changed. 


I also did try mushrooms after making these last posts. I actually[found them also grim](http://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=37992). Now that you've reminded me, I am considering this compound for the next potential trip ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png). Which is funny, since I was giving some consideration to try shrooms again in a controlled setting if they present themselves to me.

I do think this is a great one, but it doesn't have much to offer until you hit the high doses around 30mg (then it has lots and lots!).  It's variable on the individual though, you've got to find the sweet spot for yourself.

With 24mg, acetate ester, freebase, oral: "It came on fully in about an hour and made me very twitchy for the next 45 minutes, after which my body began to relax and it became very sedating for several hours.  The headspace is a little confusing and my motor coordination is wonked.  There's a fair amount of visuals, mostly of wobbly lines and a constant moving waviness in objects, but zero color enhancement.  Sex is great.  A little too disjointed to really go into music.  Well natured and enjoyable, without too much of a negative aside from the initial myoclonus."

I tried ethocetin around/about 2003, as well as ethocin at that time, but it's been so long so I can't say for sure how it was back then. That being said, there was no remarkable difference between the two.


ethocin has yielded great experiences. as some others have said, it has a strong energy to it which can be stimulating. Tremors are only minor, though on coming down once or twice the leg tremors were persistent.


It does lack substance in some regards, as "mindfuck" doesn't really happen in the way it can with mushrooms. But, the stimulating aspect is uncomfortable to some.


As a tool to produce eye-candy, ethocin is great. The visual alterations are more organic and smooth, much like with psilocin, and unlike miprocin or iprocin. Duration is short, oral route best bet (note: insufflation is extremely painful with this one)


Experiences are preferential to 50mg+ of the fumarate salt, this is where the visuals are prominent and can become stunning, especially outdoors.

**4-aco-det**


I was wondering if anyone has any first hand information on this substance, such as dose, duration, bodyload, and routs of usage...  If there is already a thread on this feel free to bump.   Thanks....

My preferred dose for 4-AcO-DET was around 20-35mg, but if you're starting you will probably want to try less.  There's not a lot of bodyload.  Oral is nice.

I think most of the reports I've read on this are not the fumerate, I have the fumerate, so could anyone give a dosage comparison on a mg to mg basis from the fumerate of 4-aco-det.  Has anyone snorted this, how bad does it burn and what is a good dose.  I love 4-ho-dmt and have been looking for a substitute since my vendor no longer has psilocin. I've tried 4-ho-mipt and 4-aco-dmt both are similar but not close enough to psilocin. If 4-aco-det doesn't make the grade my next test will be 4-ho-met...

I just calculated it out for you, because I'm putting off the work I have to do that much, haha.


From the HCl to Fumarate - 1:1.257  **Edit: Aleph below me pointed out I'm an idiot.  Don't use this ratio!**


I doubt that 4-AcO-DET will be closer to 4-HO-DMT than 4-AcO-DMT.  Maybe it'll be perfect though, or you'll like it better.  Tell us what you think!

Yep, the two compounds salt at a 2:1 (ethacetin:fumaric acid) mole ratio.


4-HO-DET

Freebase: 232.32 g/mol, chloride salt: 267.77 g/mol, fumarate salt: 290.36 g/mol

I don't know if anyone else will agree, but 4-aco-det is almost identical in its effects to 4-ho-dmt. My girlfriend and I both tried it out last night at 20mg each. She swallowed hers, I insufflated mine. It didn't burn and I felt it in 5 minutes. Body buzz felt Identical to insufflated 4-ho-dmt in my opinion. And besides slightly less visuals my girlfriend couldn't tell the two apart. I also like the fact that Hoffman made it as the next step in 4-ho-dmt experimentation. Anyone else's opinions would be welcomed.  Peace.....

To be honest I can barely tell any of the 4-HO/4-AcO-Ts apart (or from mushrooms) except maybe -DiPT.  They're all pretty similar when it comes down to it.

Isn't the freebase MW 273.36g/mol (source wikipedia, double checked by me), and then the chloride salt would be: 308.82g/mol and the hemifumarate: 331.40g/mol?


Making it a 1:1.07 ratio from HCl to Fumarate?


Wow, that's way better dosage wise.  Why do people always complain so much about fumarate's then?

[http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/showthread.php?t=401596](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/showthread.php?t=401596)


Mostly there's a difference comparable to the freebase.

Yep, it's called a diprotic acid, eg oxalic, malic or tartaric acid.  Tartaric acid's stereochemical properties allow it to be used to seperate enantiomers, it's neat stuff. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I've had them both, only difference I really noticed was that 4-AcO-DET lasted an extra two or so hours but was less potent.

I would say take about 120% your dose of 4-HO-DET.  The material isn't terribly interesting until you get up to high doses (for me anyway).


I never had any of the effects that the above poster had -- for me the bodyload was always clean and there were no residual effects.

Ive got so many 4-AcO/HO chems to try and no time dammit! I have some AcO-DET now and some HO-DET being made (also 4-HO-DPT and DET!). But theres still AcO-DMT and HO-MET to get to first...


So, which would you guys reccomend out of 4-AcO-DET or 4-HO-MET? 


Above both though is DET. Shame synth wont be finished for the long weekend ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)

Some time ago candles and music were taken to the basement and at 9:30PM and 20 mgs of 4-ACO-DET was tested. There was an expectation of something along the lines of 4-HO-MIPT??  What was amazing is how different these two substances were.  It took an hour to kick in and then the next hour was something else. Astounding CEV's. Landscapes, pictures, of a Christmas theme since the house was decorated. Candy cane tapestries, mushroom type, but a little different. Very beautiful changing dimensional scenes. It was astounding. That was a good solid dose. Any more and it felt like the grip on reality could be lost but just enough to enjoy that thought. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) Down by 4 1/2 hours later with some residual visuals. Had some phenibut, kratom, and mulungu tea at 2:00 AM and was asleep by 3:30AM. Then I had to get up at 6:30.


When It was pulled it out of the freezer and cut it open my hands were shaking being so nervous. I had to get passed that. I had been depressed (what else is new eh?) the last few days and was looking to get around that with insight. There was some over stimulation and points of sharp anxiety, not quite as smooth as mushrooms. And although there were a few good "ahah!" moments, it kind of lacked the insight of a good cosmic mushroom trip.


The sample had been stored for a few years in an airtight jar. I'm not thinking any degradation occured (of which stories I always felt were exaggerated when it comes to tryptamines). Probably a fairy stable compound if stored correctly.


I feel honored to have been given a small sample a few years ago.  I look back fondly.

Heh, Ethocetyl was one of the first psychs I've tried, before I had the chance to experiece shrooms, or DET to compare to, as my earlier posts in this thread suggest. 


Now, many years (and may psychedelics :D) later, I can make a more precise comparison, and in retrospect, I would say that 4-AcO-DET is closest to simple DET of all other psychs, more so than it is to shrooms as may people seem to think. Even before I tried DET, I never saw the similarity to shrooms. 


That said, IMO there is simply no question that simple DET is far, FAR superior to its acetate ester, or mushrooms for that matter ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png).

The first time I took 4-HO-DET, I dove in at around 15mg which is roughly equivalent to the 15-20mg range  you mentioned for 4-AcO-DET. It was an interesting experience, I enjoyed it very much although I have to say not as much as 4-AcO-DMT. It's alot like psilocin/psilacetin but without the heavy bodyload and yawning, and a clearer- almost stimulating head buzz. The body load manifests more as twitching and jerkiness which magnesium could help, as well as a little hash or MJ to calm the mind. I'd say that it was slightly more anxiety provoking than mushrooms or 4-AcO-DMT, but not enough to deter me from trying it again. It has a slighly more metallic "twang" to it than mushrooms, which for me is where the anxiety came in. I hope my short comments help you on your 4-AcO-DET journeys, and be sure to report back here with your own!

This thread is too itty bitty for such a WONDERFUL drug.


I dosed 25mg two nights ago and it was a truly fantastic experience!


2c-e made me mostly miserable. It was too intense and the body load was horrid. Looking back, I honestly hated nearly every minute of it.


This was completely different. I felt like I was rolling, but less stimulated, better visuals, and no crash.


I just cannot say good enough things about this!! ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif) ![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif)

I felt the come up starting at 15 minutes, and it lasted about an hour. The big peak was around two hours, and I was still feeling really good for about 2 more.

I IV'd about 4mg of 4-AcO-DET at about 12:15pm last night. I had measured out 6mg, but this was my first time IV'ing anything and I don't have much experience with the drug so I only injected about 2/3rds of it.


It was a very enjoyable experience. I didn't feel it right away -- it took perhaps a couple of minutes to become noticeable. Then when I looked at my computer wallpaper (it's a picture of the Oregon coastline) I was simply amazed. It seemed so vivid and real. Colors were popping, clouds were moving across the sky, and the waves were gently progressing toward the shoreline. 


About an hour in I decided to smoke some marijuana, and it certainly did intensify the trip a bit. I was very tired by the time the next hour rolled by, and I was able to sleep easily although the effects were not entirely gone.


Overall I very much enjoyed this experience. One thing I noticed is that my cognitive abilities (not sure how else to word that) were pretty much intact. It enhanced reality without really taking me anywhere, if that makes any sense (in contrast with something like 2c-i or 2c-e).

Hey there,

I need your advise because I´m not sure whether I should buy 4-ho-det or 4-ho-dipt.

I simply ask this question because my funds are limited every month and I´ve already 4-AcO-DMT 5-MeO-DMT 4-HO-MET 4-HO-MIPT and 2C-E in my personal collection and would like to expand it.

It´s kind of difficult to find out which is more "psychedelic". I´m frustrated about the little experience reports about 4-HO-DET. I expect some interesting effects because of its structural similarity to 4-HO-DMT and LSD.

I'm expecting a small bit of this, but honestly it sounds not too interesting, I would still like a taste for the novelty and it was dirt cheap... but the DETs seem like kinda duds, don't they do?

I am trying to figure out an appropriate range for this...lately i have been a bit of a hardhead and taking 25mg of this did absolutely nothing (which is odd because when i later took 25 mg of 4-aco-met I was flying)


I would like to have this work but I don not know what the dose response is (every x amount of mg creates a x increase in intensity, etc)


would 40mg oral be too much?


thanks

According to Erowid, 40mg is the upper edge of the "Strong" dose range. Take that for whatever it's worth.


In my personal experience, 40mg - after having dosed 25, 30, then 35mg in previous experiences - was incredible. Absolutely blissful. It was the best trip I ever had with AcO-DET. I may be wrong, but again,* in my own experience*, this chemical is so gentle that I believe it would, for me, take well over 40mg to cause a bad trip, if it could at all. Every report about this substance talks about how mild it is, sometimes to the point of not even noticing its effects.


It's my favorite tryptamine thus far because of how gentle it is, though, while still maintaining very nice visuals (though not as intense as other tryptamines) and "mind expansion" (again, not as intense as other tryptamines), though that's not the best way to describe the mental effects. I guess "enhanced creativity" and "clearer thinking" are more accurate. Some people don't like that - how mild it is - but you might.


EDIT - I would describe it as almost similar to MDMA in that it's nearly impossible to not enjoy it, even in higher doses. Again, that's a personal summation, so your mileage may vary.

i have only tried a low dose but i didnt find it to be very clear headed. Well not more so than 4 aco dmt or 4 aco mipt at a similar dose.

I was actually under the impression that it might get pretty psychedelic at the doses 6/7 mentioned.


So for those of you new to the chem, start low and work your way up.

Oh yeah, I should have included that in my post. Just because you can take 40mg doesn't mean you should right off the bat.

The shuddering effect of 4-HO-DET and 4-AcO-DET are disturbing but they definitely have among the nicest tryptamine buzzes out there.

I took 28mg of 4-AcO-DET several months ago.  I got the shudders for a few minutes towards the end of the comeup, but they subsided quickly enough.  It was interesting & novel, but I definitely preferred 4-AcO-MET.  Wish i still had access to both to do some further testing ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

I didnt experience any shudder like peripheral effects, fortunatly. No body load at all. I also got some really cool visuals from this drug; I had this big opaque glass RGB screen covering my field of vision, moving sort of like drops hitting a still liquid surface, if that makes any sense. Very cool.


This stuff really makes me want to get some 4-HO-DET.

Excuse my ignorance, I'm still not as taught in the world of chemistry as I'd like to be, but I was reading the entry in tihkal for 4-ho-det and the reports say they were done with the indolol, phosphate ester, and acetate ester. As mgs said on the first page 4-aco-det is the acetate ester of 4-ho-det, which makes sense to me, because acetate=acetoxy? So what are the indolol, and phosphate ester and which one creates the hydroxy?

I am no chemist too, but I think I can give you answer to your questions.


As you can see, the word "indolol" are derived from "indole"(aromatic structure, the core structure of all tryptamines) and -ol, the suffix for alcohols. And an alcohol is "any organic compound in which a hydroxyl functional group (-OH) is bound to a carbon atom, usually connected to other carbon or hydrogen atoms." I copied this definition from wikipedia. So, technically, 4-HO-DET is an alcohol. The next interesting thing, alcohols can form esters with oxygen-containing acids.


Look at the acetic acid, for example:


![100px-Acetic-acid-2D-skeletal.svg.png](https://www.bluelight.org/community/proxy.php?image=http%3A%2F%2Fupload.wikimedia.org%2Fwikipedia%2Fcommons%2Fthumb%2F0%2F08%2FAcetic-acid-2D-skeletal.svg%2F100px-Acetic-acid-2D-skeletal.svg.png&hash=cf0db3d4f65398c4cb3e5274ff55d262)
 

and at the 4-HO-DET(aka ethocin, named after psilocin - 4-HO-DMT):


![140px-4-HO-DET.svg.png](https://www.bluelight.org/community/proxy.php?image=http%3A%2F%2Fupload.wikimedia.org%2Fwikipedia%2Fen%2Fthumb%2F8%2F84%2F4-HO-DET.svg%2F140px-4-HO-DET.svg.png&hash=72b5378780d9abe8039cf156bec5f947)


and finally at the resulting ester 4-AcO-DET:


![140px-4-Acetoxy-DET.png](https://www.bluelight.org/community/proxy.php?image=http%3A%2F%2Fupload.wikimedia.org%2Fwikipedia%2Fcommons%2Fthumb%2Fa%2Fad%2F4-Acetoxy-DET.png%2F140px-4-Acetoxy-DET.png&hash=38b27476ee39be175c73ce03ff71996d)


It is also called Ethacetin(after 4-AcO-DMT, which is Psilacetin).


And also, phosphate ester exists, 4-PO-DET(aka Ethocybin, named after psilocybin - phosphate ester of psilocin):


![200px-Ethocybin.png](https://www.bluelight.org/community/proxy.php?image=http%3A%2F%2Fupload.wikimedia.org%2Fwikipedia%2Fcommons%2Fthumb%2F9%2F91%2FEthocybin.png%2F200px-Ethocybin.png&hash=6607fc0c6cb536f19b7fa1e748866ee8)


Look at the corresponding acid - phosphoric acid: 


![160px-Phosphoric-acid-2D-dimensions.png](https://www.bluelight.org/community/proxy.php?image=http%3A%2F%2Fupload.wikimedia.org%2Fwikipedia%2Fcommons%2Fthumb%2F5%2F58%2FPhosphoric-acid-2D-dimensions.png%2F160px-Phosphoric-acid-2D-dimensions.png&hash=eefab8ac4dfbf654bea1a975f2cb04dd)


As you probably know, there is the hypothesis: both 4-PO-DET and 4-AcO-DMT are metabolized(by dephosphorylation and deacetylation) in 4-HO-DET. Some people may disagree, but all three compounds should produce approximately the same range of effects, although 4-HO-DET should be most potent by weight.

Thanks a lot for the quick and informative reply! I read DMT: The Spirit Molecule a bit over a year ago and now I remember him talking about the indole structure, but had forgotten about it. The only thing I didn't quite understand was the 152pm, and 157 pm in the posphoric acid structure.

**4-AcO-DET**


Can anyone comment on this chem? The only info I can gather is that the trip is 'generally similar to mushrooms'. I'd like to know if this is a worthwhile rc and what peoples experiences have been like. Any potential for this one?

procured a small amount of this recently, planning on testing out the waters early next week.  I've taken 4-AcO-DET once before in 2009 i belive, could've been 2010... anyway I have the freebase this go 'round & was considering vaping some given the success people have had with 4-HO-MPT via that ROA & i was curious if anyone had tried vaporizing 4-AcO-DET. I have some suspicion that vaping 4-HO-MPT may just be delivering MPT as that HO group may well be cleaved off quite easily.  Definitely going to reacquaint myself with ethacetin orally though. Thinking probably 25mg, took 28 last time, but not all at once, think it was in two 14mg capsules about an hour or hour & a half apart.  


Any of you guys have any interesting recent trials with 4-AcO-DET?

I don't have time to read through this all atm, so I thought I would just ask to possibly save some time: How does 4-ACO-DET compare with 4-HO-DET?  I've gone through plenty of the 4-hydroxy version.

I know the general trend is for the acetate to be somewhat sedating, and i've found that to be somewhat reliable with 4-HO/AcO-DMT & 4-HO/AcO-MiPT, but i have not found ethacetin to share that sleepy quality with its acetylated brethren. To be fair though i've not taken 4-HO-DET.

trying to find out how 4-aco-det compares to 4-aco-dmt 


ive been told 4-aco-dmt is a lot like mushrooms - however i read here that 4aco-det is like mushrooms - can someone clarify that has done these as well as describe any advantages/disadvantages to taking the aco-det over the aco-dmt or vise versa ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) thanks..

well, they are both a lot like mushrooms because they are both chemically quite close to psilocin. Psilacetin (4-AcO-DMT) is the closer of the two and it retains a lot of the same mental characteristics of psilocin, albeit with somewhat less anxiety, but many people find the visuals to be somewhat different. I realize some may disagree, this is just my opinion based on what i've read & my own experience. 4-AcO-DET hasn't been as widely used so obviously i've not read nearly as much about it, though i have had the chance to taste it on three occasions. It doesn't seem to create quite the same headspace as mushrooms, but it does certainly have a lot of mental "trippiness" to it. The visuals have a slightly different character than either mushrooms or psilacetin, as seems to be the case when the n-alkyl chain gets longer.  Most recent experience was with 3 friends and a good time was had by all, lots of joking around & whatnot, nothing too serious.

IME, this experience was reminiscent of mushrooms but fairly light hearted. It did have depth however, this is different than what I've read about 5-MeO-DALT, for example.


I've only tried it once but it was definitely something I'd repeat if I felt like dropping money on getting more.

So it seems some people have a bit of anxiety with this chemical. Anyone have any solutions to prevent any possible anxiety when taking 4-AcO-DET ? I will be trying it out soon. 


Also, I read there isn't much of a body load but would taking 25mg of Diphenhydramine help to counteract any possible body load ? And would it be completely safe since it slightly acts on serotonin ?


I plan to take around 15-20mg orally.

I wonder if the people who get anxiety from this could use mild anti-anxiety herbs like maybe chamomile or catnip. A prescription sedative would alter the experience too much to be worthwhile imo. Just something effective but not intoxicating would be good here.

I've been enjoying my trials with 4-AcO-DET lately. I'm always hesitant with new 4-subs since their always so variable for me but AcO-DET felt incredibly light and airy(note though I haven't dosed to highly yet). Like a middle ground if it was between 4-AcO-DMT vs 4-HO-MET vs 4-AcO-DET. Strong enough to notice fair mental activity but not strong enough to get really immersed or swept into anything.

Well I had a wonderful experience with 4-AcO-DET at about 15-20mg or so. Zero anxiety, no body load. Slight random jitters during the comeup but nothing that was bothersome. Dissolved the chemical in a glass of orange juice and drank it at 10 PM, was asleep by 3 AM. 


It's great if you don't want to be tripping for too long. The visuals were some of the best I've had, lots of warping and during the peak almost entirely consumed my visual field. Apparent psychedelic mind state but not any super mind fuck. I've only ever had mushrooms once and it was not a very good trip.... So I can't really comment if it was all that similar.

22 mg had me pretty far out there. There were a few points where I was uncomfortable and began to be scared but mostly I was enjoying myself. I had no concept of the difference between boys and girls, food, the idea that I needed to work to support myself, sex, chemistry and math. I existed. After about 2.5-3 hours the trip quickly dropped off and I was mostly lucid. I would definitely do it again.

I tried this one for the first time at 20mg. I wasn't sure that 20mg was going to be enough because I suspected it would be more mellow and light the way 4-ho-met is for me so I had 10mg booster doses already capped up and ready to go if I needed them.


Let's just say...I didn't need a booster. 4-aco-det, while very short (about 3.5 hours of actual tripping) produced a lot of fun visual distortions, laughter, some euphoria, pleasurable physical tremors. It was quite sedating and there was a slight nausea for the first hour. Nothing too bothersome on the physical side of it's effects. I think I could go pretty deep with this one at a  higher dose and wouldn't take it out at a party mainly because of the sedation. 


The whole experience from ingestion to when I would likely be able sleep was only about 4 hours with the effects dropping off quite suddenly. The shortness was the only thing I didn't like about it. However, I'd say that this has the potential to be a challenging, full-on psychedelic in the right circumstances. I'd recommend this one but caution people against thinking it isn't going to be a challenging material.

This chemical seems to love a certain kind of administration. My most recent experience with it was with a 20mg oral dose, followed by 15mg smoked after the initial come-up. The 20mg oral dose was slightly weak IMO, but I'm a big guy so I've come to expect this. It tapered off with moderate wavey-geometric visuals, but nothing earth shattering. I then smoked the additional 15mg, and boy did it ever come into full bloom then! Excellent geometric patterns on randomized surfaces such as the ceiling and the carpet, exactly what I was expecting. Felt more earthy than the 4-HO chemicals I had tried, more grounded, and as champ said, slightly sedating, which I found relaxing. Little color alteration, however, surprisingly little. That said, it was an enjoyable experience, and yes, as others have said, very similar to mushrooms. I would say if you were looking for a decent approximation of the mushroom spectrum of experiences, this would be the way to go.


By the way, I will be trying higher doses soon, with the same oral/smoked combination. It seems that once the receptors are primed by the oral dose, the smoked dose rockets the experience up much more immediately. I will return with more information on the matter next week.

Typically across the board only 30-50% of an oral dose may be necessary, also for drugs that are otherwise mild and gentle the sudden rushing onset can feel skyrocketing so be careful and modest with the dosage. I must admit for this etacetin I cannot say whether 10 mg would be okay but it seems like it can already be a full dose. So in any case my point is: I certainly wouldn't go higher than that if I were you. But the prospect sounds intriguing.


I have yet to try mine, tbh it is not at the top of the list but it sounds interesting nonetheless. I wonder how it relates to 4-AcO-DPT which I also still have to try when I have time.


For those who have sampled this, is there jelly legs or leg tremors with this 4-AcO? How enjoyable is it? What kind of experience is it best suited for: general enhancement and augmentation, if so more intellectual or sensory or physically? Good for a serious trip, or rather a recreational and easy one?

How's the long term storage potential of the compound?  I saw those anecdotes of the compound turning black after a few months on the 4-aco-dmt thread.  Any reason why some squirreled away would not last 10 or 20 years?

22 mg was very intense but still enjoyable for me. I could see the trip being very intellectual if I had taken a bit less and was able to actually form real thoughts. I think that at lower levels it could be any kind of trip, I certainly felt very good and euphoric, but I was surprised at how quickly it became more than just fun. It was much more potent than any 4-AcO-DMT I have had.

Potent quantitatively or qualitatively?


Also, I don't think my product degraded visibly after having it stored in a deepfreeze with desiccant and airtight mini mason jars. Black stuff probably forms when there is no sufficient protection against moist which is even more "agressive" in a freezer than a fridge since it slips in and condenses everywhere. You might know this from the block of ice that forms if your freezer does not close properly. I don't think the compound degrades if the right containers and desiccant are used, also 4-AcO's tend to be more stable than 4-HO's as a rule.

awesome, that's what I was thinking. I only have a small amount of this chemical, and would like to use it in the most affective way possible. 


My only previous 4 sub tryptamine experience was with 4-aco-dmt. I took 30mg oraly and got minimal results. I then proceeded to spend the rest of that night wasteing the remaining part of the 100mg sample I had purchased trying to get where I had wanted to go. :-( . This was with the fumerate from a larger, reputable vendor, so the quality is not in question. 


I don't want to be underwhelmed again, but defiantly not overwhelmed either. Will perhaps even drop it to 8mg and see what happens. 


Can anyone speak on redosing? With 4-aco-dmt, from what I recall, it was pretty much one redose within an hour will be affective, anything else is a waste. 


I have a feeling this thread will start growing fairly quickly. I think this chem will be the next 4-aco-dmt in terms of popularity and availability.

Potent in the sense that I can easily take 25 mg 4-AcO-DMT FB and not be floored or anything and with 22 mg 4-AcO-DET (not sure what form) I was FLOORED.

Interesting, I always enjoy noting the interpersonal differences, which can be quite substantial. I have found psilacetin to be the one more likely to floor me, usually takes 20-30mg to reach that state. With ethacatin I found 20mg a bit underwhelming & 35mg to be right on the money for the type of experience I was looking for. The duration with ethacetin is markedly shorter for me as well.

Ended up trying this ~8mg/9mg last night mixed with 25mg mxe via RA. This was the night after doing ~125mg mxe. I took 1/2mg etizolam ~45 minutes before. 


I ended up trying this late last night. Had been thinking about it for a while, and couldn't fight the itch any longer. It was late, about 2am. Was going to go with 10mg, but bumped it down a touch and added mxe b/c it made me feel less nervous knowing I'd have the chill mxe feeling as a back. Late at night and nervous, great set/setting right? Fuck it, that's what the bag of etiz in my pocket are for ;-)


It seemed to take a while to show, I felt the mxe sooner. Perhaps it didn't dissolve as well? I didn't keep time at all, but it felt like it took 20-30 minutes to really start feeling the 4-aco det. I was smoking a joint looking in the mirror, and got that "hey there is something different" feeling almost immediatly for sure, but I didn't feel the "mushroomish" vibration/buzz for about 20-30 minutes. I went and laid down on the couch and put on some music and soon enough that familiar, but different, feeling started to creep over me. Headspace was rather clear, no paranoia or anything. Started getting some liggght CEV. No OEV to speak of, but that isn't abnormal. It seemed short lived, seemingly starting to die down after 30 minute so. It wasn't really strong though to begin with. 


Got up and ate a hotpocket and drank a ton of milk and passed out probably 20 minutes later. Eating seemed to dull the 4-aco-det buzz for sure. Just said fuck it and passed out before I started thinking about taking more.


I don't think the previous nights mxe use affected the 4-aco-det. I was feeling the 25mg mxe plenty well enough for the dose, and would assume it would be the same for the 4-aco-det. 


My only previous trial with anything similiar was with 4-aco-dmt at a 30mg oral initial dose, followed by another 40mg in wasted doses too late to make any difference. It was underwhelming to say the least. Nowhere near what most people report at that dose. Quality was not in question. 


The RA dosing of 8/9mg should be roughly 12-18mg? Definatly didn't feel to be on the higher end. 


I wouldn't call it a waste as I wanted to get a smaller test out of the way. I shouldn't have as much anxiety next time, and will start a lot earlier. Will most likely go with 20mg RA. Want to try 25, but might be a bit more cautious than I normally am. 


Was definatly fun though! Haven't felt that vibe since december, and that was just once. Before that it has been since 2008. Excited for next time! Glad I wasn't stupid enough to try and bump my dose and waste the rest ![:-)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Hi all!


After a lot of research, I have decided that this will be my first psy experience, as it seems mild and enjoyable (and of course, legal).


I just ordered 100mg about 10 mins ago, and will update with my experience when it arrives!


My plan is to start with a 1 mg allergy test, and if that goes well move up to 10 mg and go up from there if I feel the need.

My ROA will be oral.

It just arrived! It came as a very snow white, but erowid shows it as brown? I just wanted to know if this is ok before I ingest it.


Also I'll have to wait just a little while to tell you guys how it goes, I just dropped down to 10mg (from 20) of Celexa a week ago, and I feel very off, I want to wait till I feel normal again before I try it; which I hope is within a week or two!

Pure 4-AcO-DET is a white crystalline solid, but it may turn brown over time due to the formation of oxidation products.

Yes it should be white. Don't be alarmed if it startes to turn slightly brown. In my experience there was no loss in potency. Have fun and be safe.

To prevent oxidation & browning its good to store it in the freezer, airtight to avoid condensation.  Hope it works out well for you! ethacetin's definitely among my faves in the 4sub tryptamine category.

Hey!

I've just placed an order for 250 Mg's of 4-Aco-Det. Contemplating on doing several run-through's at pretty high dosages bordering 70-75 mg's.

Considering that Tryptamines tend to have a feasibly milder effect on me, I've decided to suck it up and go for the big money.

I've read probably all of the Erowid on it reports by now, and it seems to resemble 4-Aco-Dmt, which I enjoyed.

'Cept at the peak, where the colors all blurred into one another, kind of canvasing each other. It wasn't very visually appeasing.

Well, I'll be back with a trip report in a matter of 7-10 days.


Nice trippin'. :0)

^I wouldn't jump in at that high a dose. Although you may think you are super-tolerant to 4-sub trypts, you never know how each individual compound will react with you. You should still start with a reasonable dose (after allergy testing).

That's true, didn't take that much into account.

I think I'll allergy test, then dose at around 15 mg's.

I was at the weed man's house last night and he randomly ask me if I know anyone who wants any shrooms. Ended up with 10.5 g's for $45. So awesome. Haven't had any in about three or four years, been wanting some since last october. 


Thinking of 2g's to get a feel for them again and mixing in  5-10mg 4-aco-det an hour or two later and seeing what happens soon ![:-)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

In combination I have a feeling inside me that I do not like this one as much. Taken alone or together with a 4-ho I never really had problems with it, however combining with some later trials with MXE and Ethylphenidate this compound has given very bad bodyload on the verge of believing you are about to die. I also god a sudden rash on one incident where I almost fainted out had it not been for given nutrients and people around me being much aware. There seems to be something fishi going on with this one.


Usually I would look at this compound as a visual enhanzer, but again. Some combinations here are to be aware of. The latest trial where I almost fainted and got a rash my friend had huge problems hanging in there himself, somthing which was very obvious as he was very aware of since he was constantly reminding himself of breathing. This was in combination with Ethylphenidate which seems to boost the potency of 4- and 5-, I would not recomend this really anymore.


Taken alone without Ethylphenidate and MXE I have never had any real problems with 4-aco-det however that I recall.


I do see more people in this thread picking up on the anxiety part, so be aware atleast when mixing compunds here.

I took 9mg and i thought it was too much body load.. I was shaking and rolled up in a ball.. the visuals were more closed eye and they were good visuals, but not amazing like i would imagine 20mg.. however i worry about going higher than the 9mg due to my reaction.. 


I did notice that with eyes closed the patterns were very detailed and if i thought about someone i would see them like a vivid image of them, makes me wonder if the visuals are just fragmented memories before they become memories..

Just allergy tested sub milligram. Slight headache... Most likely from the 3.5 hrs sleep and or cleaning compounds used in my apartment hall today. 


I ... Think I may actually have an effect. I skipped calibrating scale. But couldn't be more than 2 mg. Plan to take nap after some short errands, and dose either around 20 mg orally, or less rectally, if I can find the tool to do it.

This stuff seems to leave a lot intact, at the dosage I tried. I'm still feeling it. Wow on time dilation.


Considering a small dose of 4-AcO-DMT orally.


A tiny fingerprint of 5-MeO-MiPT made ... I couldn't control it. It was a reaction.

Yes, 4-AcO-DET HCl can be smoked or vaporized as if it were N,N-DMT freebase. It mixes well with cannabis in joints/bowls.

had an interesting experience with this compound some time ago... was thinking of writing a trip report but havent managed to get round to it...


dose was ~18mg+/-2 mg, orally. it was taken at home on a nice winter evening with nothing much to do and looking for a recreational short trip.


total trip time was around 5 hours including the rather short (~45 min) comeup and not too annoying comedown (<45mins). visually nothing too impressive, however, the bodyload was very reminiscent of mushrooms, and somehow of 4-ho-met. very pleasant, and some will enjoy it more than others im sure. it felt less anxiousy than 4-ho-mipt in that respect.

dont know what to make of it really. it felt like a really physical trip, and perhaps a social setting or a more engagin one (nature walk?) would have suited it better. 

im going to try it again ina different set and setting, and pehaps at a higher dose to se where it goes from here on.

overall id do it again, but not in a hurry. 

Rating 6/10

I finally sampled some 4-aco-det yesterday.  I took it 1 1/2 hours after a light MXE experience (15 mgs.) in order to lessen any body load that might be present with the aco-det.  Whatever it did worked quite well.  


Was going to dose 10 mgs. (orally) and I'm sure glad I backed it off to 8 mgs. in the end.  I am extremely sensitive to all psychedelics and this 8 mgs. was a roaring +++ intensity.  


the come-up was virtually identical to mushrooms: nothing for 30 minutes and then a fast ramp up between the 45-60 minute point.  no anxiety, no nausea, excessively euphoric.  the energy feels slightly higher pitched than mushrooms.  At first I was calling it "electric mushrooms" but, looking back, that's not entirely accurate.  it's nowhere near as electric as Acid, it just has a higher pitched buzzing that is slightly stimulating...though not unpleasantly or forcefully so.  keep in mind the MXE may have cancelled excessive stimulation in a positive way.  along with the stimulation, simultaneously, there was a deep relaxation....a drunken intoxication, less so than mushrooms, but with absolutely no confusion or lack of clarity.


I wasn't expecting an intense trip, nor a visual one, but somehow ended up with both.  The visuals were typical mushroom style, though with perhaps less color.  I also tripped in the day, so that may have masked any potential for colors.  I was looking at my fan, when i first came up, and it was doing the usual bending/warping game.  I thought, "okay, we're not that deep here...more the shallow end." within a minute of staring at the fan I started seeing spiraling manadala patterns weaving through the air between my eyes and the fan.  "okay, i guess we're getting in deep water...." 


the intensity was ramping and ramping until it quite literally blew me away.  it didn't shatter my ego with the usual tools: aggressive de-realization, forced out-of-body, spinning thoughts, etc.  Rather, I voluntarily sacrificed my ego on the alter of absolute Wonder and Marvel.  the trip was difficult to navigate in the first 15 minutes of peaking due to the sheer intensity of it.  my body felt almost identical to mushrooms/DMT in that gooey, alien, clammy, twitchy, overly-self-conscious kind of way. it wasn't as distracting or potentially anxiety-producing as with mushrooms though, and the worst part only lasted through the first 15 minutes of the peak.


in a daze, i wandered into the kitchen, desperately grasping for some kind of ego-gratification.  i grabbed a ripe nectarine out of the fridge and stared at it like it was the Holy Grail.  suddenly i felt like a squirrel, and greedily hid the nectarine while running to my room.  Pulling out my "big secret" (the nectarine) i cautiously took a bite. All at once, in a single moment, i was thrust into the most jaw-droppingly euphoric state of Absent-Mindedness.  I raised the nectarine above my head and shouted with joy.  A gift from the Divine, created solely for my ecstatic enjoyment.  


I starting running around my house in a controlled state of manic exuberance.  I never felt out of control (like with acid or mushrooms) and i never felt like i couldn't voice an issue if need be.  I simply became a different entity, an elf creature, and hid out in my upstairs loft in the middle of the forest.  with shouts and moans of joy i ate nectarine and after nectarine, one at a time, crawling downstairs on all fours, sneaking past my lady (like she was a security guard and i was a thief), stealing nectarines, and running back upstairs, trying not to "get caught."  in reality she didn't care what i was doing, but it sounded like a BLAST to be like an under-cover squirrel.  


in my loft, between bites, the carpet would turn into vivid landscapes and sway back and forth across the floor.  i started moving my spine side to side in unison.  the euphoria soared as the visions synched to my being, and in an ecstatic eternity, i beheld the dance of creation (vision) merge with the creator (mind).  all melted.....no one left.  bliss unrelenting.


i only peaked for an hour and a half.  it was the shortest psychedelic experience i've ever had with an oral dose.  i wasn't sad to see it go, though it was without a doubt a true mystical ++++ experience, in my book.  it was every bit as divine as mushrooms, and no less cosmic.  yes, mushrooms are deeper, i think, but i don't mean that in a negative way towards 4-aco-det.  Mushrooms are like yellow nectarines, sweet and sour....heaven and hell....light and shadows playing on each other to produce a sensation of depth that isn't easy to mimic.  this 4-aco-det was more like a white nectarine: just sweet, no sour.  there's a soft sweetness to 4-aco-det that's almost MDMA-like in it's tenderness.  like a feminine mushroom spirit.  it's seems much more forgiving and gentle than it's older brothers.  but to call females "less powerful" than males is misleading.  for some people, the strength of Divine Grace and Love heals deeper wounds than any nuclear blast could.  sometimes after mushrooms i feel shaken and scattered.  for the last 24 hours, i've felt nothing but gratitude and awe at such a "gentle" and healing experience, all things considered. (as if psychedelics could be called "gentle"!)


flavor-wise, this is the closest thing to mushrooms i've ever tried...even more than 4-aco-met (Which felt more like a cross between acid and mushrooms). and i've never tried 4-aco-dmt, so that may be closer.  it literally felt identical in its backbone experience, the other changes were slight, and i had to dig to find words that separated them.  i find that 4-aco-dipt only feels distantly like mushrooms, so it's not like i'm just comparing 4-sub's to shrooms across the board.  i would choose the 4-aco-det experience 10 out of 10 times over mushrooms.  it was smoother and gentler than mushrooms.  the body load wasn't as pronounced. the euphoria was equivalent, but without the potential for anxiety. (in me anyway...).  there were times when a thought or sensation felt ominous, but it never lingered.  these are "positive push shrooms" at their finest.  


A new ally has been summoned....and what golden wings she soars on...

Great report Dragon-N.  Makes me curious how I'd react to it these days, because your words "gooey alien" seem to remind me of what I remember from it....on the other hand I note 'post iboga' most psychedelics are way more significant and deep and even different (thankfully not 2C-T-7...same perfection) than they seemed to be before, I generally attribute that to different 'set.'


And I don't generally have 'body loads' anymore with anything, I have learned to be at peace with the things I feel no matter what on a psychedelic.  4-Ho-DET was always pretty 'tremor ridden' and...well the visuals weren't all that great compared to some others....but it did give me a very important ++++ once but that was also a BRUTAL trip (Pain of The World) so I never went back.  4-AcO-DET seemed much the same way, perhaps slightly longer and less tremor-ridden but only slightly.

I hold the 4-AcO variant of DET in very high regard among the 4-sub tryptamines. To me, it is on par with 4-AcO-DMT, somewhat superior to 4-AcO/HO-DiPT and 4-AcO/HO-MiPT, and clearly trumps 4-AcO-DALT, 4-AcO-DPT, 4-HO-MET and 4-MeO-MiPT.


My dosages (all oral) have been 20mg, 30mg, 40mg and 45mg. At 20 and 30 milligrams, body load was minimal; at 40 and 45 milligrams, body load was moderate. The lighter tests produced restrained but warm and attractive visuals; the heavier tests produced visuals of magnificent beauty and intensity (particularly with eyes closed). In all cases, the headspace was rich and rewarding.


Note: I have not yet bio-assayed the 4-HO variants of DALT, DET and DPT, and the 4-AcO variant of MET.

I am so glad I made trip reports and keep notes, I'd be spinning all kinds of tall tales otherwise.  Turns out, I've only taken 4-HO-DET once, a smaller dose, and it had less 'side effects' than 4-AcO-DET according to my notes.  It was 4-AcO-DET that gave me that very brutal ++++ that I still will never forget.

Weird, 4-HO-DET is the only substance that ever gave me a ++++ too.  That was with 16 mg or so rectal.  I later tried 4-AcO-DET at 24 mg and had a fairly moderate ++/+++ response, but nothing much at all like that trip.  Never had negative physical side effects from both 4-HO-DET and 4-AcO-DET.

My third 4-AcO-DET test -- the 45mg one -- yielded an emotional and personally significant ++++.

each one is different.  and potency could vary quite a bit.


for example, with 4-aco-dmt fumarate, i seem to 'need' 30 mg or more to get a decent trip.

but with 4-ho-mipt fumarate, i get a quality trip from as low as 15 mg.  i actually started at 25 mg miprocin, and worked my way down to 20, and then 15.  15 was still very worthwhile.  


if i had based my dose of miprocin on my experience with 4-aco-dmt, i think i would have overshot.


i've not tried 4-aco-det, so that's the end of my tangent.

Agreed.  I too found 15mg of miprocin very worthwhile (actually if I remember I took 12mg, and 14 the other time) and I tripped my BALLS off on 20mg, far more potent than psilocin or psilacetin.  I'm pretty sure if I trip on a 4-sub tryptamine anytime soon that isn't psilocin it will be ethocin.  Oh... I am so off topic.

[the wikipedia article on 4-AcO-DET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4-Acetoxy-DET) claims that this compound was already synthesized by Albert Hofmann in 1958, but I think this is just a misconception of the [AcO-DET primer on erowid](http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/4_acetoxy_det/4_acetoxy_det_primer.shtml), which wikipedia quotes as source: what Albert Hofmann indeed synthesized in 1958 was 4-HO-DET (CZ-74) and its phosphate ester (CEY-19), which leaves the question open why first investigated the acetate ester? was probably Shulgin the first one to do so anyways, and if yes, when?


probably I should just look up in the bibliography of TiKHAL, but unfortunately, I don't have my printed edition at hands right now. will do so later, anyways.

Anyone else with experience with 4-AcO-DET? 

More comparisons between it and other 4-sub-trypts would be awesome to read.

Hopefully i'll be contributing to the acetoxy-diethyltryptamine knowledge-well soon. Thinking of going straight for 18-20mg, almost certainly with spliff at the comedown. Going to take a notebook and see if i can't produce a trip report of sorts, probably chill around a fire in the woods, hopefully time the peak for around sun-set. Will be my first solo-journey on a 4-sub tryptamine, hoping for that change in perspective that reveals what's next sorta thing - i'm pretty stoked!

I personally favor the 4-ho-met over the 4-ho-mipt and the 4-aco-det. I find a increased sensitivity to sound/music as well as a deep spiritual component not as evident in the others. Interestingly the 4-aco-det enhanced the sense of taste beyond the others. The 4-ho-mipt can be almost too confronting regarding cognitive dissonances. I find the 4-ho-met and the 4-ho-mipt substancially more potent and hallucinagenic than the 4-aco-det, all are useful and beautiful in different ways. 

Another interesting and totally different than the aforementioned is 5-meo-mipt. I have never encountered a more promising compound for enhancing the erotic.

It is tragic that all of these compounds aren't more widely available and in use and instead the trend is widespread villification and eventual criminalization as these amazing chemical tools become more known.

I always found 4-aco-det to a bit more lackluster than the other 4 subs, 4-aco-det to me always seemed like a drunken version on 4-aco-dmt. though I've only had 2 encounters with it at 17mgs each IN, so I do plan to go deeper one day. I do have to agree with the above poster 4-ho-met, as much as it lacks mental depth its damn near impossible not to have a gut busting laugh you ass off trip every time.

I'll expand a bit on my previous post.

I've heard of "supertasters" before, people with apparently much higher than normal density of nerve ending on the toungue or? I even had a roommate who was one for a few years. I was always mystified by her reaction to food. And although sensory enhancement is common throughout the tryptamines the effect the 4-aco-det had on my sense of taste surpassed substantially any prior enhancement of that sense I'd experienced before. Conversely my sense of hearing was least augmented by the 4-aco-det.

The 4-ho-mipt is a great tool for sorting out psychological issues. It is kind of like having a friend who will tell you the painful truth about your circumstances and or behaviour without any concern for how much embarressment or hurt the insight might engender. Very useful though not inherently pleasent.

The 5-meo-mipt can stimulate the erotic nature like nothing else and amplifies the sense of touch. It gives such an easy joyful sense of creaturehood. Sharing this with a lover could be nothing short of amazing. Be aware I could imagine this resulting in indiscriminate sexual coupling under less than ideal circumstances.

Lastly my personal favourite the 4-ho-met. Singing and playing guitar while using this gentle substance are beyond sublime. In contrast to the 4-ho-mipt, the 4-ho-met is like that sweet gentle friend who while still scrupulously honest focuses on the beauty within rather harraunging incessantly about personal defects like the 4-ho-mipt can at times. And although I perceive a spiritual component in all chemicals of this class, no other reminds me as much as 4-ho-met of the experiences of love and light that I experienced through over a decade of hours daily formal drug-free meditation. 

No doubt others will have their own perhaps quite different experiences from mine; I don't mean to be difinitive, just illustrative.

Not a big fan of either the 4-aco-det or the 4-ho-det. These two seem to give me personally a few tremors and just feels a little... lacking for some reason. 15 mg doses to 20 mg doses consumed from a few sample bags a long while back. Maxed out at 20 mg with increase in the tremor to a worrying degree, jaw shudder as well. Found this with the 4 HO DET as well. Also a little to stimulating As other posters seem to have mentioned. Maybe just a little to high a dose?


 Anyway even if I came across either diethyltryptamine today I'd give it a miss.  I do really enjoy the 4HO-MET, probably one of my favorite substances, sigh... I have not come across this little lovely for some time.

10-20mg.....not sure, had to eyeball......would of liked to do more......next time I'm doubling it.....maybe tonight.....seems like one that can be done with little rest.....hard to say cause its so short...im not one to trip 2 days in a row, but I'm contemplating it......il probably wait till next weekend though.....gonna have to get some 4 aco dmt cause id like a little longer of a trip...this is to short for me...maybe for some folks it would be perfect.

Yeah tolerance to all psychedelics builds very rapidly and if you do them too often you get long-term tolerance that takes a long time to go away.  It's best to leave a week between trips, or longer is better.  Every week tripping will build your tolerance too, but you can get away with it for periods of time.

I remember 4-AcO-DET having really "bright" visuals.. everything looked very bright like my perception of brightness in everything was boosted way more than most tryptamines. 


I've heard great things about combining with specifically 2C-I (specifically that one and not other 2c's).  Moderate oral dose of 2C-I (20-25mg) then when peaking IMing a good dose of 4-AcO-DET..  haven't tried it myself but I heard it produced the same parallel rectangle grid you get upon entering DMT hyperspace.

I have a feeling my vendor screwed me.

That french Canadian vendor which sold me 4-aco-dmt that took insane doses for me and my friends to get high (60mg+).

The 4-aco-det I got looks and tastes identical to the 4-aco-dmt from him and has the EXACT same inflated dose range.

After his mishap with the rusty DPT I'm really losing all faith in this company

I used to do customer service work for them and I know how they ran and probably still run... I've been advising people to stay away since the AMT and DPT I got from them were both so disgusting. That DPT wasn't just rust colored, it was a mix of rust and white crystals... The AMT was so poor that the stuff had goo'd up inside the bag it wasn't even powder anymore. I tried it and it was the dirtiest high of any drug I'd ever done. I managed to find some powder left in the bag and tried that and it was fine. That's also where I got my 2C-T-7 from now that I think about it, no wonder I don't like the stuff there's no telling what they had done to it. 


I know for a fact that they didn't refrigerate or even store their chemicals in glass, they were all kept in bags and who knows how they were stored before that because he bought all of the other Canadian vendors stock when they went under... The one that started with an N. They had a great reputation though so I bet they did it right. 


Either way, it always looks suspicious when a vendor changes their domain so many times yet alone the wave of complaints that you hear about them. 


Sorry for the massive OT post. Oh and their 4-AcO-DMT was the only 4-AcO-DMT I ever tried and I'm one of two people I know of who gets insane anxiety from the stuff, maybe I should try some from my new vendor...

What kind of body load are people getting from this? I've got access to this, and that is what is holding me back.


The only comparison I've got for an almost unbearable body load for me is when it feels as if every molecule in my body is vibrating forward/backwards/left/right/up/down all at the same time as well as rotating clockwise and counterclockwise simultaneously. That gives me a bit of nausea and vertigo, so I usually end up sitting cross legged to resolve it. This is on ~6+g mushrooms or 28 mg 4-AcO-DMT.fumarate. 


Any comparisons of body load of this to the drugs I mentioned (or LSZ) appreciated.


thanks


Tom

I have had just recently from your vendor DPT, 4 aco dmt and 4 aco DET.

so far, the 4 aco dmt has been very potent at 30 mg and even 10mg was a decent dose... however, the 30mg wasnt very pelasant, intense but a bit hard to focus on something pleasant. was a bit overwhelming and sense overload.

oh, and ive just done a 10mg DPT and I can confirm it is effective ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

so far so good for me.

Did 30mg (half oral half up the nose) this morning and was thrown into a very short but strong very visual trip.....I actually fell asleep during the peak!!? Prolly won't do up the nose any more, it burned my throat/mucosa


Very visual compound.....did have a bit of GI discomfort , but 5 minutes and a BM later and that was relieved.


Glad I took a couple of weeks off(11 days).....next time I think I'll go for 35-40mg

Interesting that you fell asleep during the peak. Do you find it to be sedating or simply just non-stimulating?


I tend to get a decent amount of stimulation from all psychedelics. The only time I've fallen asleep is while coming up on 5 grams of mushrooms. Suffice to say it was pretty jarring to wake up in the middle of that experience!

Background: I gave 4-ACO-DMT a good test of 20+ trips rainging from 15-35mg. This was my marker for a 4-ACO-DET test.


I then decided I wanted to see the 4-ACO-DET vs 4-ACO-DMT difference. 


For me 4-ACO-DET was a lot more visually active at my usual 20mg dose of 4-ACO-Dmt. Lots more fractals, mazes & hyroglyphics overlayed my vision, with neon colours predominant. Although this was pretty fun it lacked the spiritual depth of its DMT cousin. I have also seen visuals on 4-aco-dmt that blow DET out of the park. Not as colourful and fun but way more in depth. For me DET for fun DMT for a journey!

okay, Ive done 12-13 mg orally yesterday.

It wasnt very strong, but gave me a good intro to the substance and a +2. very euphoric and smooth, no mind fuck, no anxiety. Nothing like 4 aco dmt, very welcoming.

I will likely try 17 mg next week!

So from what i read its more shallow like 4 ho met and not as deep as say 4 aco dmt ? Ive had this one for a while and haven't taken it yet. A friend really enjoyed it and said it was highly visual


So did u find it more darker.and sinister  than other 4 aco xxx like reports say ? Ive only ever felt that with high doses of 4 aco dmt a feeling like being frightened. I personally dont think  4 aco det will be like that and expect it to be pretty recreational, not too deep, and decently visual ? 


Would u consider it more recreational like how 4 ho met is for me or deeper and has the ability the cause probs in public ?

WAY LESS darker then 4 aco dmt for me

4 aco det seems very friendly and not bizarre, less alien more gentle while 4 aco dmt is much more weird and scary to me and uncomfortable.


4 aco det is visually less strong but mentally very smooth, but I have tolerance as ive done al lad the day before dosing 4 aco det.

it seems to be very interesting tryptamine and I will test it at 25 to 30 mg next time

Exactly it sounded very good to me despite all the negative comments i see about it

 For me 4 aco dmt gave me real visuals 4 ho met gave me visuals but totally diff than 4 aco dmt. Less realistic, less in your face, more translucent  highly visual in the dark though

 So you say its not visual like 4 aco dmt. Would u say its visusally similar to 4 ho met. I only took 20-24mg 4 ho mipt and that wasnt very visual at all and extrmely euphoric....

To be honest, I don't think you guys are talking about what you think you're talking about. I'm one of the the most recent people who's been writing trip reports about how dark and sinister 4-AcO-DET (and 4-HO-DET) can be. But frightening, scary, and uncomfortable are *not* words I would use to describe the experience, nor would I say that there's really anything negative about it at all. 4-AcO-DET is beautifully gentle, perhaps the most gentle psychedelic I've taken so far. The darkness has nothing to do with the trip being negative but simply the way that the visuals and the accessible emotional range feel in general. Unlike on a lot of psychedelics where you're nothing but happy and bubbly, on 4-AcO-DET I find it extremely easy to think about the darker sides of life such as death, but the feel of the trip is so warm and welcoming that it actually allows me to make peace with these things by associating positive feelings with them instead of negative ones. Even when I allow my mindset to take me into a complete demon netherworld on 4-AcO-DET, including with demonoid entities (the best description I ever saw in another trip report was DMT entities dressed in demon costumes), it never feels even remotely threatening. As for the ways the visuals actually unfold, their darkness can be compared to high doses of LSD, in that they can get very shadowy and delirious in style in a way distinct from the most typical psychedelic visuals. In some ways, they actually remind me a lot of how 5-MeO-DMT visuals have been described to me, including the frequent flashes of white light, but that one I've never tried myself to make a direct comparison. From my perspective, all of these things are very positive and part of what make the experience unique; I actually tell people that 4-AcO-DET is very dark as one of the main selling points, not to scare them off.


As for quick comparisons based on my own experiences so far....


Fractals: 4-HO-MET > 4-AcO-DET >= 4-AcO-DMT > 4-HO-MiPT

Hyperspace: 4-AcO-DET >= 4-AcO-DMT > 4-HO-MET > 4-HO-MiPT

Visions: 4-AcO-DET > 4-HO-MET > 4-HO-MiPT > 4-AcO-DMT

Euphoria: 4-HO-MET > 4-HO-MiPT > 4-AcO-DMT >= 4-AcO-DET

Dissociation: 4-AcO-DET > 4-HO-MET > 4-HO-MiPT > 4-AcO-DMT

Body Load: 4-HO-MiPT > 4-HO-MET >= 4-AcO-DET ~= 4-AcO-DMT


These may change with future experiences, so take them as you will. Do note that of these four, I have also only had a complete ego death, with feelings of infinity, cognitive disintegration, and blinding white light, on 4-AcO-DET.

I'm very excited, I will receive this chemical pretty soon! 


Can it be stored well for months?

Glad you found it useful. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) Yes, I'm starting  to think that 4-AcO-DET may be my favorite drug besides LSD. ![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif) And I  love the dark part of it, it's good to find balance to the light that  many psychedelics (including 4-AcO-DET) can bring. It makes the trip  feel more whole, and like it taps into much deeper parts of my  consciousness. It also just makes the visuals awesome lol. Visions for  me can range from beautiful naked women with fractal energy wings to  huge netherworld temples with skull imagery everywhere and populated by  demons and then back to floating around with more of the erotic female  entities in huge fields of white light all in the span of like a couple  minutes. And by hyperspace I mean comparable to DMT, with when it feels  as though you are interacting with autonomous entities inhabiting  another accessible plane of reality. I haven't tripped hard enough on  4-AcO-DET to completely break through to the other side, but I have seen  through the veil and watched the entities awaiting my arrival and felt  them analyzing me. The space they were in seemed like your very typical  demon netherworld in neon psychedelic colors. 4-AcO-DET does have a  mindfuck for me as well, it's similar to 4-AcO-DMT in the way that it  can feel very lucid but very cognitively overwhelming at the same time.  Putting yourself in the right mindset and having the right stimuli is  the key I think. On my last trip with 30 mg, listening to music sent me  from feeling a little tripped out to complete ego death in a matter of  seconds, and when the song ended I was back to clearheaded again. That  versatility is part of why I love it so much, it's really something!

Well, I've had it for about ten months or so  just in a sealed baggie in a dark place at room temperature and it  doesn't seem to have degraded even slightly. If you actually put it in  the cold and everything I would imagine it would keep up for quite some time!

I can't say I have used this chemical. To the best of my knowledge this chemical is better in the fall and winter months. There is at least an individual report of a person experiencing an autoimmune type of response in the spring after this chemical. For some people this chemical is great, they say that this chemical is enlightening. I just think the the biological changes that the body experiences as things get hot and greasy in the spring aren't the best set. On the other side, low dose DMT is great in the spring.

yes, the trip is very short. but I dont feel any darkness. if anything, I find it positive more then neutral.

like any tryptamine, it make you deal about the depressing aspect of life, but its very not dark.

4 aco dmt for me is dark compared to 4 aco DET.

4 aco dmt has more mind fuck to me then 4 aco det. I barely had any mindfuck in my trip

but I feel any psy experience is so dependent of the user and that 20mg could knock someone and to me, it was quite light.


I have never tried 4 ho met, but my next attempt will be 30mg, 20mg of 4 aco det was really not taxing mentally. I was with my girl all night long and she didnt realize I was on any drug. it seems very fun and recreational compared to the seriousness of shrooms or 4 aco dmt.

very promising! I much prefered this to 4 aco dmt.

As I mentioned earlier in this thread, I regard 4-AcO-DET very highly. For me, this is the finest of the 4-sub tryptamines, along with 4-AcO-DMT, and in some ways, I prefer it.


It's interesting that Goddess Mode regards this material as being "dark". I can see why she generally (but positively) responds to it in this manner, though, as this drug has a very "earthy" character. For me, 4-AcO-DET is warm, reassuring and iridescent, like a star-filled night sky in late summer or early autumn. Indeed, I would describe this compound as nocturne-like, and it's easy for me to luxuriate in its intimate opulence.

have you tried 4 aco met?


the set is truly great, but its also the first sub 4 I've had, and i have deveopled a tolerance since then so i think that has skewed my perspective on the others

I haven't tried (or possess) 4-AcO-MET, but I'm very familiar with 4-HO-MET. I enjoy it, to be sure, but I rank it below several others in the 4-sub series. That said, I tend to prefer the AcO's over the HO's, so it's possible that 4-AcO-MET would be higher on my list than 4-HO-MET.

Why is your preference the acetoxy over the hydroxy? Also, I've read some people think that DPT has a somewhat dark edge; would that make an interesting combo with this substance?

Generally speaking, I feel that the AcO's yield a somewhat fuller and longer-lasting experience. Regarding a mixture of 4-AcO-DET and DPT, it might be alright, but I would go easy on the dosages. If I were to try this combination, I would go for no more than 20mg oral of the former and no more than 50mg insufflated of the latter; the former ingested first and the latter thirty minutes later.

Ive taken around 20mg tonight. it was strong tonight, more then my last time with the same dosage.

Ive had overall a nice trip, crazy visual, very deep for me as always, until one moment:

my cat was on me and suddenly, he looks up in the air and scram the fuck out, totally scared. what he saw, I felt. 

it was very dark and all my room and smh me, something inside me? seemed to be filled with darkness and it seemed it was around me.

that was very scary for me as I couldnt help but feel that something negative was in the upper corner and around me. the fact that my cat really was looking at it almost following it around the room in the upper part of my room, for a long time, and I was trying to calm him but I knew he was seeing something I didnt, but felt, and that it was really there smh. damn. very very scared for a moment. Ive concentrated myself on love and induced in me loving kindness concentration and within 5 minutes, I was afraid anymore, but that was very freaky for a moment. the sad thing is that just before that moment, I was in pure bliss totally connected with the light of love, fully immersed in love. then out of a sudden, my cat started freaking out, ect.


after that incident, Ive been able to calm myself down in like 10 minutes. but those 10 minutes were scary.

4 aco det doesnt last long at all, the peak was 2 hour and the visual come down very fast after the peak. id say its 40 minute come up, peak for 1h, plateau for another hour and a half max then comedown.


anyways, my setting wasnt perfect as im tripping way to much recently and I got a big warning. stop fucking around!

First of all, lamanoguacha: I'm sorry it took so long for me to get back to you, but thank you for the message! I tried to send you a more full response than that, but your inbox is apparently full. You may want to clear it out in case anyone else wants to PM you in the future. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


Second of all....


This is not a trip report from myself, but I figured that I should come here to share some of this information just in case anyone was wondering or concerned. I actually saw a friend, with basically no current psychedelic tolerance and no experience with this compound, take 30 mg of 4-AcO-DET orally last night and then vaporize another 20 mg between a bowl of cannabis while peaking. I know that some people have been wondering about vaporization and just about pushing higher with this chemical in general, so I figured it was worth noting that this friend did not seem to experience any negative physical consequences from this dose/route mixture. I was carefully observing his breathing rate and general physical state while he would be off in his own world too and I also didn't notice anything significantly different from normal. He credited the vaporized dose with dramatically increasing the strength of the trip he was already experiencing, and I noted that after that hit he went from seeming stimulated but mostly lucid to tripping over his own words and not really being able to finish complete sentences, though still very much in control of his own actions. Maybe fifteen or twenty minutes later we went outside and he did a balloon of nitrous oxide, in which he laughed so hard that snot came pouring out of his nose, which is I guess the one thing you may want to watch out for because it was pretty nasty to see lol. As for his actual experience with it though, I had never seen him get hit so hard by a balloon, laughing like a mad man, and practically the only thing he could put into words afterword was how amazing it was. He had a very difficult time describing his experience in general, which is something I also find to be common with 4-AcO-DET, but claimed that it was very refreshing and just what he needed. He also noted the distinct lack of very strong visuals or body high, not that these things weren't present at all, but was okay with that because he was looking for a more mental trip. Pretty much high ratings from him all around.


Anyway, just thought I'd leave this here....

Very differently indeed, for me 4-AcO-DET also has shockingly few visuals! Though, the level to which it is dissociating and enhances my visual imagination is so severe compared to other psychedelics that I imagine that a dose which brought it completely into my external reality would suddenly flip and make it seem *extremely* visual. One of these days. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


The vaporization was done the same way that I would smoke DMT out of a bong (as this was), which would be this setup:


*** <--- Flame

___ <--- Empty Space

XXX <--- Thick Cannabis Layer

ooo <--- 4-AcO-DET

xxx <--- Thin Cannabis Layer


Then, just very lightly tapping the flame down on the top cannabis layer so that it starts to heat up the 4-AcO-DET, and then just doing that in a two or three hits until there's nothing left and you can just pull the rest through. This has worked both times that I've prepared it so far, so it seems to be effective enough to achieve a significant level of psychedelia, but this is also the only way I've ever tried it, so I really can't compare to how it would be for potency with like a GVG and an extremely precise technique or something. You may have to experiment a bit, but this method should at least get you started!

Hey! I'm sorry about that, Goddess! My work load has been heavier than usual lately, so I haven't had a proper chance to read BL for a couple of weeks... and it promises to stay that way for another one or two. Anyhow, I made plenty of space in my inbox, so shoot me a message whenever you like. I check for messages daily, but I didn't notice that my box was full! Silly me... Thanx for the rest of your post. It's an interesting read.


For the record, my lowest dose of 4-AcO-DET was 20mg and my highest was 45mg. My preferred dosages are 35mg and 40mg. I invariably take this compound via oral ROA.


Regarding the 45mg trial, that was one of the most beautiful and meaningful psychedelic experiences of my life: the rare ++++. I'll withhold describing that experience here, though, because that description is reserved for a book that I've been working on for some years (and which will take a few more to complete).

No worries! I haven't been around much either, life has been very busy lately and it's probably only going to get worse before it gets better, I'm mostly just on in short blips like this now. Anyway, I'll send you something again when I have the opportunity. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


I'll bet that 45 mg dose was amazing! I'll have to keep my eye out for the book, hehe. I've still been working up the guts to go that high, I've been very picky about my set and settings when chances arrive lol. I have no doubt that it can take you to those mystical states quite easily though, as it felt that way for me even at 30 mg. It's not incredibly visual on the external world for me at that dose though, but it's verging on it.... I can imagine that things would get quite a bit more intense than they have for me already when I push it that much higher. I really should get around to that some time soon. >.>

Last year I took 25mg of a 4-aco-dmt 4 times, I only had a good trip once, like I've read in the appropriate thread for it, it seems people get more and more anxiety and not much worthwhile thoughts even with ^^. Is 4-aco-det like this too? I can finally buy 100mg for pretty cheap, which would be 4 doses too? 4 medium/normal doses? I would be preloaded with benzos anyway (benzohead here, legally and gray legally...it's not as bad as it used to be but with psychedelics I have to take double my dose of daily valium before going in, it doesn't reduce effects for me at all). Because the 3rd and 4th time were totally horrible trips with barely any visuals and no happiness and fun visuals. Usually watching old movies or cartoons will push the visuals button for me and they will be everywhere and I can even turn off the tv or computer and things will continue to be pleasant. I'm extremely experienced with LSD (250 trips or so over 11 years, it's over now though, I don't know where my guy is these days), unfortunately experienced with Surprise DOB so even if I'm a benzohead, if I'm properly benz'd I am not a nervous/panicky person, psychedelics or not.


Just want to make sure this isn't sharing the typical increasingly unpleasant experiences, even if months or 3 weeks or so seperate each experiences of 4-aco-dmt. It is also the fumarate of 4-aco-det.

Ah I forgot to reply to this earlier.  I personally have never found any psychedelic to give me increasing anxiety the more times I do it, usually the opposite in fact, and that includes 4-AcO-DMT.  I find 4-AcO-DET to cause more anxiety than 4-AcO-DMT... take that for what it's worth.  I think 4-AcO-DET is a great substance though, it's kind of an intense, emotionally charged, occasionally jagged trip but it's very powerful and beautiful.  I can't tell you whether you'll experience increasing anxiety with it though.

Thanks Xorkoth and sorry for the late thanks ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


Yes, I found 4-aco-dmt to be very emotionally charged, the last 2 trips I didn't enjoy, I was judging myself extremely harshly once the intensely visual part was done with.


I hear 4-ho(aco?)-mpt might be more in the ballpark if I want to assuredly have more fun, I ask because both are an option for me and one of the 4-xxx-mipt's also, I can't tell which now. I'm very used to LSD like if I was to do a couple of blotter from where I can get it since the year 2000? (it's not the usual 45ug ish stuff that circulates the US when it's not something else entirely). 


LSD, I can handle a plenty (had it 235 times according to this txt i carry around since a pentium 100 used to hold the info and I find it to be a lot less harsh mentally than the shorter acting tryptamines.

Id like to know as well as 4 aco dmt was hard a bit like you explained for me and the other friend the two times we dosed.


very harsh mentally indeed with exaggerated sense of being a bad person lol.

I wonder what 4 aco would be recommended to avoid that.

its weird as even with shroom I dont get that bad of a vibe

It was deeper than general feeling of being a bad person. It was throwing in my face all the plans I say I will do but never do, which wouldn't be much, anything outside work and I'm drained and I can't keep most promises and responsabilities and I was feeling deep empathy to the people who think I can easily be better than this. Anyway, not fun to reflect on this at 3:30 am with zero visuals but a really mean headspace. Shrooms don't cause this to me either.

I found my one 4-AcO-DET experience to be similar to this as well... very few visuals, and a pretty in-your-face state of mind.  I spent an hour or so very disturbed about some possibly phantom physical sensations in my teeth that led me into thinking about how I am getting older and I need to take care of myself.  The trip really focused on my mortality and it was pretty difficult for a while.  Then eventually I worked through it and emerged into a slightly frazzled but beautiful mindstate and euphoria, where I felt like I was brushing against a complete control over my mind and muscles to an almost computer-like degree.  I played some music along with Santana's Abraxus album along with my bass player tripping companion and had a really powerful learning experience.  Overall it was a sinewy sort of trip, powerful, deep, edgy and personal and containing a lot of darkness with the light.  Barely any visuals to speak of.  I'll repeat it again someday but it wasn't something to take lightly, I felt.

Is there  a 4-ho-det thread ? Is it any different? I'm thinking if I handle shrooms just fine, maybe 4-ho-xxT is the way to go for me. Although I've read some 4-aco/4-ho are basically the same because they turn into the ho, but I think have the 4-ho right away is what causes the dramatic change of 4-ho-dmt compared to 4-aco-dmt for me. 


I can also obtain it and other things I didn't even know existed when out of the loop being told are much more "fun" like 4-ho-MPT and and 4-ho-TMT(is that right?, won't verify right now, I'm having problem existing and not going mad into an urticaria bout because of a damn birch allergy and we're in season indeed and i'm out of any antihistamine, if they wont renew my hydroxyzine faster than normal I'll have to spend a bunch on desloratadine (works so much better than loratadine...not a case of let's make a new patent" for me).

Yeah there's a 4-HO-DET thread, and no they're not the same drug, there are of course a lot of similarities but the 4-HO and 4-AcO versions of each tryptamine are not identical.

You should consider the acetate ester (4-AcO-DET) as this survives storage better. Also the metabolic progression is the other way around.

Well, it would be a quantity small enough for just maybe 4 trips of 4-ho-det. I already have some 4-aco-det here, along with just one dose of Proscaline (and that's for another thread, I never tried it, other mescaline analogs I can get.


I found a place finally that is no-nonsense, well rated somewhere vendor which has 4-ho-det (and a ridiculously huge list of products) and everybody on that particular review site views it very well. I was going to buy a little DiPT due to the probably hilarity of going out at the outdoor concerts in both my provinces's national holiday and canada day...the best 7 days of the year usually, but 2 vendors i knew of that had it now has a grayed out add to cart button. ugh.

Tried this stuff for the first time the other day. Ate 20mg with a good glass of wine. Smoked a joint at the peak. Great buzz. It was pretty euphoric actually. The visuals were great too. I'll be using this one a lot for sure! 


I ate 25mg followed by 20mg more insufflated over the next 45 minutes. Tolerance was there and the visuals were still good.

I'd like to give a heads up on this stuff with performing music.On 20mg, my dexterity isn't diminished,and my memory can still function enough, to play complex pieces of music, on my piano.Practicing on the electric organ is even better with the light easy action of the keyboard.Playing music on this stuff is a blast.

Dosed 25mg the other day along with some 3-MeO-PCP. This stuff has some strange physical effect on me. Everytime I took it I had a lot of shaking and tremors on the body. Like really violent. It's not a bad body load, as I quite even enjoy the shaking and feel it really funny and not unconfortable at all. But I'll prefer to dose 4-AcO-DMT or 4-HO-MET instead of this one. I'm think I'm done researching, and I'll flush what I've got left of this.

^I am glad I never delved into the risky drugs such as PCP analogues. PCP's potential brain damage, the fatalities, psychosis, and the stories of addiction kept me away. I had been avoiding focusing on researching the neurotoxicity PCP creates. Considering the PCP analogues were recently made prevalent in PD, perhaps I should focus on researching those dangers more.


The 4-subsitituted tryptamines are beautiful as is. I only take them alone. This is how they are most enjoyable and safe.

^I do tend to agree that that dissociatives as a class are substantially more risky--at least in terms of behavioral "toxicity"--than psychedelics. Manic-psychotic episodes are certainly possible--and that risk is clearly amplified in the case of the compounds that feel more subjectively "clear-headed" or that lack ketamine's propensity for inducing couch-lock.


However, I do hope you realize that the term "PCP analogue" means very little. PCP is a potent agonist at the PCP site of the NMDA receptor, at sigma receptors, and at dopamine receptors. 3-meo-pcp (the "analogue you've probably seen "pop up" in PD more often) is actually well-established as being unusually selective--hitting just NMDA and sigma-2. 3-meo-pce is also making the rounds, and has generally similar properties to 3-meo-pcp, although I don't know if its binding profile has ever been examined.


Now PCE (eticyclidine) was scheduled around the same time as PCP because it was found to have nearly identical properties. PCM (meticyclidine) is also comparable to the other two, though I don't believe it ever managed to get scheduled. MXE is 3-meo-2'-oxo-PCE. For that matter, ketamine is 2-chloro-2'oxo-PCM.


Many of the PCP "analogues" you see pop up in PD are just as closely related or even more closely related to MXE or Ketamine than they are to PCP. They're just named more easily using a shared nomenclature, rather than as derivatives of whichever dissociative drug we feel like evoking.


And more food for thought: the more potent drugs are actually comparatively less physiologically toxic,since less material is consumed: ketamine is known for causing bladder damage. This damage is markedly reduced with MXE, and further reduced (essentially to zero) with the handful of highly potent analogues that only require doses in the single-digit milligram range.

On 4-ho-DET: I've considered picking it up a few times, but from what I've read it's very much comparable to 4-ho-met in the same way that 5-meo-dipt is comparable to 5-meo-mipt. That is: subjectively similar, except with a profound "electric" bodiload including shaking/muscle tremor. While that's not necessarily a subjectively displeasing attribute, it doesn't do wonders for my opinion of the compound's safety.

I don't know that 4-HO-DET would actually be very similar to 4-HO-MET. I've tried 4-AcO-MET at least and it doesn't sound very similar to 4-HO-DET at all. And I've tried both 5-MeO-MiPT and 5-MeO-DiPT, neither of which had very many similarities at all. They were actually very, very different from each other.

That is: subjectively similar, except with a profound "electric" bodiload including shaking/muscle tremor. While that's not necessarily a subjectively displeasing attribute, it doesn't do wonders for my opinion of the compound's safety.

The -METs and -DETs are very dissimilar as far as differences between 4-sub-tryptamines are concerned.  The -DETs are much more serious and electric in nature for me, rather cold and psychological, while the -METs are earthy and warm and emotional, and colorful.

InterestingFACT,


In general your comment made me think the recent potent PCP analogues weren't potentially harmful. I researched the toxicity of drugs interacting with the NMDA receptor. Bladder toxicity isn't the most dangerous effect. Nerurotoxicity is the most dangerous effect. Be clear in your explanations. The last thing you want is misinformed people using dissociatives thinking they aren't potentially harmful, experiencing permanent brain damage, then destroying the reputation of the classical psychedelics by association. The War on Drugs won't last without drug abuse tragedies. Let's prevent those tragedies. Let's keep people informed, responsible, and safe.


The worst physiological effects from dissociatives result form interactions with the NMDA receptor. This neurotoxicity is potentially the most dangerous with the potent chemicals. The fact the users of PCP analogues report permanent tolerance is especially concerning considering research has suggested brain damage results from the usage of similar drugs. I avoid any drug causing irreversible brain changes.


Hence, I prefer the classical psychedelics such as LSD and 4-substituted tryptamines. I prefer the effects of classical psychedelics and they are physiologically safe.

You're referring to Olney's lesions. 


Those are largely speculative in humans--though some recent research on ketamine has borne fruit--and have been discovered in animal models of ketamine and dxm abuse. And in fact they have never been found in any of the recent pcp analogues--though I'm sure only because of lack of research. As a side note: NMDA tolerance is not truly permanent, nor is permanent tolerance a hallmark of neurotoxicity. Those concepts are just not related in the way that you think they are.


Your comments are non-specific and prone to generalization, but also misleading. If you meant to say that you believe dissociative drugs pose a neurotoxicity risk than I agree with you. That being said, this risk only manifests in abuse scenarios, and is considered sufficiently minimal that the medical establishment feels perfectly comfortable using ketamine in a variety of new drug trials for antidepressant and therapeutic effects. Moreover, if this is what you meant to say, you should have said "I believe NMDA antagonists are dangerous" or "I believe dissociative anaesthetics are dangerous." Inserting the terminology "PCP analogue" is a scare tactic meant to engender an emotional response, and is misleading for the reasons I already described. When you do this, you're not helping, you're hurting. 


I'm getting the feeling that you aren't participating in this forum in good faith. There are many people on this forum who don't use dissociatives--either because they aren't interested, or because they aren't willing to risk addiction/behavioral "toxicity" as a described. I personally don't frequently use them--I don't particularly enjoy the dissociated state, and I think that frequent use is a slippery slope with signficant risk of addiction and negative effects on social environment. However, I don't think anyone is making that choice because of a hypothetical neurotoxicity risk. If that's your reasoning, that's fine, but you're attempting to insert loaded terms into conversation to describe a partial picture of that reasoning as if it's more rational than it is. Please stop.


I don't believe nor care whether you're steamboatbill (as someone accused you of in that other thread). But I do care that you participate in good faith. Past a certain point I'm going to get tired of even responding to your posts--but someone will have to, because otherwise your misinformation will be allowed to stand unchallenged.

It's because of your repeated characterization of arylcyclohexylamine dissociative drugs as a class misleadingly by the term "pcp analogue"--a non-specific and non-descriptive term which is in fact very likely to cause confusion regarding the subset of drugs to which you refer. The foundational research upon which your concerns rest has been conducted on drugs which many uneducated people viewing this site would not immediately associate as a pcp-analogue: drugs like ketamine, methoxetamine, diphenidine, and ephenidine. Moreover it's because of your tendency to repeat the same sentiments (i.e. I'm concerned about neurotoxicity of pcp analogues) when confronted with a response that addresses or partially refutes those sentiments. For example, I noted that the "boogeyman" of NMDA-mediated neurotoxicity--Olney's lesions--has only been observed in extremely high attack dose experiments utilizing DXM and PCP in Dawley rats, but never in humans. And I also noted that the only evidence of NMDA-mediated neurotoxicity in humans has been in extremely high-dose daily abuse of ketamine by edge-case addicts. 


I did give credence to the concern that dissociative drug use is higher risk behavior: I agree with that sentiment. However, I stated that the primary risks of dissociative drug use are addiction and social dysfunction/isolation or exposure/incrimination (i.e. getting into trouble with the law, or hurting yourself or others, while in a dissociated manic-psychotic state). I think those risks are significantly different than neurotoxicity, and deserve a very different set of analytical criteria for an individual to make a reasonable cost-benefit analysis. Neurotoxicity is *not* a compelling threat to usage of dissociative-anaesthetics.


The reason I accused you of participating in bad faith is that I made these objections, clarifications, and explanations, and you in no way addressed them in your response, but instead reiterated your original point--which was sufficiently rebutted to require at the very least a counterargument on your part to maintain face-validity.

Here PCP is still a common street drug. I know people who are engineers (mech and electrical) who were snorting it all the time when 16-20. I think the liquid in the US, which is often pure to levels the average drug user shouldn't be able to touch, and the fact it is smoked by putting pcp on a cigarette or joint has a large impact on how it acts (smoking's the only level where the BA of anything is lower than IV, in most cases, some things are 100% BA by mouth). People here eat or snort that powder which in a gram contains maybe 3-8mg of PCP, depending on who cut the 20% pure putty with lactose, normally they aim for max profit and make 15 bags to 18 bags out of such. Taken this way, like eating a pure 3-meo-pcp or MXE dose isn't that dangerous. Unless you're one of those who vape anything you get in your possession and do asinine things like smoking oxycodone pills. Your brain should be okay if not over-abused.

Hi there! Decided to post my first experience with this material here as the thread hasn't been updated in a while.


Subject: 170Lbs male with about 10 years of extensive psychoactives research which includes: DMT, Mushrooms, 4-Aco-DMT, 4-Aco-MET, 4-HO-MiPT, LSD, AL-LAD, ETH-LAD, Mescaline, Allylescaline, Methallylescaline, 2C-P, bk-2C-B, MDMA, Amanitas, Salvia, Amphetamines and other stims. Previous trip was on 50mg 4-Aco-MET about two weeks ago. Almost empty stomach (light vegetarian breakfast taken) prior the experience.


Set & setting: Alone, at home, late at night, next day off, feeling comfortable, curious about experience.


Dose: 18mg (measured on a decent milligram scales with +/- 1mg) of 4-Aco-DET, encapsulated in gel cap.


I need to add that an hour prior to taking 4-Aco-DET, Ive taken couple of grams of Kava, 500mg of Phenibut and was sipping Kratom tea (about 6g of plant material) and in introspect I think Kratom may have something to do with the trip intensity being an inhibitor for stomach enzymes CYP3A4, CYP2D6, and CYP1A2 which metabolize drugs but not 100% sure if it has something to do with 4-Aco-DET, if there are anyone knowledgeable of that interaction, please comment!


Experience:


T=00:00 - Ingested a capsule with 18mg encapsulated 4-Aco-DET with some green tea.


T+00:20 - Some uneasy feeling, becoming hard to concentrate, but nothing much.


T+00:30 - Decided to smoke some cannabis to speed up the come up process (Im a daily smoker). I read most users get the noticeable effects by 20-30 minutes and I was nowhere near yet and was thinking of amping it up but decided to wait another 10 minutes.


T+00:40 - Effects building up in intensity and quite quickly. Im glad I didnt add more at this point. Im starting to feel afraid, ego feels threaten in a similar fashion as with DMT or strong mushies come-up but with lesser intensity. There is a definite feeling of hyperspace emerging. Feels stronger mentally and a lot weirder than 35mg of 4-HO-MiPT or 50mg of 4-Aco-MET so I take one sublingual tablet of Validol (old russian anxiolytic and anti-emetic that works for me almost instantly) and it helps me to ease in into the experience. There is no body load to speak of but on the come-up body feels being jumbled inside if that makes any sense. Also, the typical hyperspace coldness was becoming obvious at this point.


T+01:00 - Feels like Im starting to peak. It feels pretty serious and analytical with super heightened emotions processing, mind becoming very suggestive, it's easy to scare yourself if new to these experiences, also there is a feeling that I usually get with DMT or strong combos LSD or mushies, that my top head chakra is being open or simply that my mind/body becomes open for entities to see and/or communicate and even enter it. So I take out my tibetan bowls and start playing, also chanting some mantras. It definitely helps me feel more secure, confident and balanced as well as providing some insights on human mind workings and it's connection to the unseen spiritual world. Vibrations are felt by the whole body, not just by my ears, very impressive! Walked around the apartment, walking feels "drunk" and not very stable, looking at myself in a mirror feels creepy, face gets pretty distorted in some sinister way. Deciding to take a quick shower and it feels awesome! Euphoria is starting to build up slowly, shower feels "electric". As for visuals, there are some open eyes distortions, waviness and contrast amplification, not much closed eyes visuals with that dose but feels like If I concentrate long enough and take larger dose I might be completely sucked by the hyperspace with all it's visual intensity.


T+01:20 - Definitely peaking. Music is driving trip easily, organic and emotional stuff like Yo La Tengo feels very nice and producing deep content thoughts interconnections and insights easily. Emotional overdrive at some points felt. High mind suggestibility makes me want to try playing a videogame that doesnt have any violence in it, I choose my girlfriend's hipster game "Life is Strange" and it created a very bright and very real atmosphere, like I was seriously being there in Washington and Oregon, being that 18yo hipster girl.. Felt crazy real and immersive especially considering I was playing it on a projector at night with all the lights off. Playing a videogame also brings more insights into how simple our life actually is and how much we over-complicate and over-dramatize it. Strong time dilation. Feeling of "The Truth" inside me. Euphoria is building up in intensity. Definite +++ on Shulgin's scale and with only 18mg! Amazing!..

There is a weird temperature disregulation - some parts of a body being very cold and some being pretty hot but not too uncomfortable.


T+02:00 - Peak is subsiding and being replaced with some of the best afterglow I've ever experienced! Very empathetic and euphoric, I even say it out loud to myself: "This stuff is 10 out 10!" Thinking of the people who I am closed to and texting a few of them. Strong desire to be a better man, to resolve old issues and work on my bad habits. Feels very very therapeutic! I see a huge potential for self-work, spiritual work and guided psychotherapy with this compound. Yesterday's problems becoming just a necessary points in life to achieve a greater understanding, everything is crystal clear and glowing with meaning!


T+03:00 - Still rolling very nicely, at this point more cannabis is smoked, prolonging and smoothing the effects. Very strange urge to redose as soon as I can, thinking of a next day trip but dismiss the idea knowing I need to be at work the following day and receptors tolerance as well, but it was the only psychedelic so far (of what I've tried) that made me feel that way, to repeat almost immediately.

Walking is still poorly coordinated - walked outside to meet the sunrise, and living in a quiet mountain town, it was amazing! Made me feel very peaceful and content. Still some color and shape enhancement going on. I thought if someone would see me, they'd think Im drunk and high so driving/riding would not be a good idea on this stuff imo.


T+03:30 - Feeling very hungry so I prepare some food. It tastes amazing, the taste is definitely enhanced more than just from weed, a bottle of aftertrip beer also feels very nice! Not feeling bodily stimulated but flooding of thoughts and ideas is present and its not letting me to think of sleeping. Emotional waves are subsiding now.


T+04:30 - Smoked more cannabis, took 150mg of 5-HTP with 100mg L-Theanine and took a hot bath to facilitate sleep. In about half an hour felt asleep and had very vivid and meaningful sleep. Upon waking up felt a bit foggy but my daily nootrpics stack along with mate tea cleared it away in a matter of couple hours.


Conclusion:

I found 4-Aco-DET to be unique, weird but beautiful, and very useful compound on par with the classic psychedelics but with even higher mind suggestibility and hyperspace emerging. There is a definite possibility of entity contact on higher dosages as well as ego melting, anxiety and possibility of a "bad" trip for some folks. I ranked it high among the very best but caution must be exercised, set and setting seem pretty important with it as well. Definite visual activity at even 18mg. Best if used for introspective work in a quiet atmosphere, alone or with close friends imo. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a meaningful revelatory trip but once again it made my mind highly suggestive, more so than most of the stuff Ive tried.


Also I have a theory that each psychoactive compound is of a different spiritual energy such as LSD being an "Air", DMT being a "Water", Mushrooms and Mescaline being "Earth" or "Fire", 4-Aco-MET being an "Air" and so on.. So 4-Aco-DET felt like it has "Water" spirit with some "Fire" undertones to it, but further testing is needed! lol

^^^Im glad to share my experiences and even more glad that someone liked it! Thank you ^.^


After not so yielding 4-HO-DPT trip two days ago Ive decided to use 4-Aco-DET to satisfy my psychedelic "hunger" ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Considering the possible tolerance from previous day's trip but still being cautious since its my second trial with this compound, I decided to take 20mg dissolved in real lemonade to promote a quicker absorption. It dissolved easily and had a specific "tasty" bitterness to it, the one you want to try more and more as you trip harder ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) 

Phenibut synergizes very nicely with it, adding more euphoria and smoothness, I also liked it with preloading with Piracetam (not Aniracetam or any other noots though).

Despite some evident receptors tolerance, the trip was euphoric and insightful, just like the first time I've tried it. So Im starting to make a conclusion that the experience with this compound is quite repeatable with similar set and setting which is very important for me as I like to know what to expect. But it doesnt mean it can't throw you all the way out there, just up the dose a few mg's and you'll get a lot more!...)

I feel a feminine power in this molecule, gentle, yet affirming and persistent but don't let it fool you into thinking it is a lightweight action psych - it definitely has the power to bend and dismantle your poor ego!..

In retrospect, I liked 4-Aco-DET more when encapsulated - it felt more concentrated in power and time.

Also, I feel it has a "Water" spirit more defined than anything else, being near water allows for a greater trip entrance imo (yet to try it on the lake/river/ocean).


Conclusion: Ive fallen in love with this one. The best RC I've tried so far in the last 5 years.

I find 4-AcO-DET to be quite powerful and different from the other 4-sub-Ts I've tried.  For me it's been pretty serious, not nearly as lighthearted as others.  It can be quite edgy and cold, but also can be very warm.  I wouldn't call it euphoric for me but it can produce intense euphoria simply due to the profundity of its effects (the same way you can get really euphoric when sober because a significant thing just happened).  It goes really deep into my psyche, I tend to confront things I had been ignoring or hiding from myself.  I generally choose a different tryptamine, but occasionally I like a high-dose trip with this because they have always ended up being cleansing and meaningful, even though at times they are confronting and unsettling.

  - Very  well said, Xorkoth! That's exactly how I feel and why I like it! ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) Tripping on 4-Aco-DET made me completely quit porn ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)  and focus on making music and loving my girlfriend, also noticed long  lasting anti-depressive aspect after taking it. I hope it doesn't  activate too much of 5HT-2B receptor subtypes- my main concern with most  psychedelics is pulmonary vasoconstriction (I'm taking Cardimap  occasionally to help preventing it), one of the possible reasons of  Alexander Shulgin's death... 

Have you personally found compounds that produce similar feeling to 4-Aco-DET?

I have yet to try a bigger dose of 4-Aco-DMT - only tried it up to 22mg  which wasn't enough for me at all and just gave me uncomfortable  "waiting" feeling and some anxiety, gotta go higher as with DMT where  you also may get stuck in the middle with half of your ego still  retaining memory access and it's functions. But of all I've tried,  4-Aco-DET remotely reminds me of only DMT. Euphoric comedown seems to  have to do with personal realization and with how much can you let go of  yourself, similar with DMT experiences once again. I wonder if mixing  them together would yield synergy?..8)

It feels for me also that with 4-Aco-DET, set and setting are of a big  importance, I found it very useful for chanting mantras and playing  singing bowls on the come-up. Pre-trip preparation such as mindful  meditation and rituals had influenced my last trip greatly!

I tried 4-AcO-DET for the first time recently and I was impressed by it. I wasn't expecting much because I had seen plenty of people say that it's not that great, but I was pleasantly surprised. I really like the style of the visuals, music sounded great, and the trip had a very cosmic feel to it. I experienced a powerful euphoric feeling that I don't often experience. It was a feeling of strong excitement, like a butterflies in your stomach kind of feeling that reminded me of being a young child. This experience was a bit reminiscent of my first few times experimenting with mushrooms. The one thing I really dislike about 4-AcO-DET is that it doesn't last long enough.

Shulgin took psychedelic drugs every week for decades and didn't have health problems until he was in his 80's. He lived longer than most people do. If anything that should reassure you that they're safe.

 - I was thinking to take it with harmaline next time for a deeper and longer experience. Harmaline tends to prolong my tryptamines and some phenetylamines, and somewhat lessen the duration of lysergamides (weird?..). I was thinking of starting with 120mg of Harmaline and following it in about 20 minutes by 10mg of 4-Aco-DET. I will definitely report back with results here and something tells me it will be interesting!.. Im tempted to add a little mescaline to that mix as well, but for the sake of experiment purity will do without it the first time 8)


As for Shulgin and pulmonary vasoconstriction: I was just really bummed out by his death, love his books and his chemical art, was waiting for another publication... It was right before my birthday too, I was tripping on 2C-B-Fly which is very emotional for me, also knowing that my father died at 59 from a heart attack, it all added to the paranoia about heart diseases so I read a shitload of material on that topic and that, of course, just scared me more... Still being very cautious about it, avoiding some evident heart straining stuff. 

But I agree with you on the safety profile of most psychedelics being pretty good compared even to alcohol and nicotine, not to mention hardcore stims and opiates. Moderation is the key with everything imo! ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

Good idea. I have some pure syrian rue extract, but I've only used it with DMT. Combining it with other tryptamines sounds interesting. I've been curious about it for a long time but I haven't done it because I like to keep things simple. If it prolongs 4-AcO-DET, I'll have to try it next time.

I'd like to note that combining psychedelics with MAOI is potentially dangerous, especially if taking daily prescriptions. Also I would advise to avoid driving/riding at all costs when adding MAOIs to your stack! I remember when I needed to drive for just couple of miles in the countryside when I was under 2 tabs of acid (Im very used to take 5-6 tabs) preloaded with 150mg Harmaline  - peak comes in differently than without MAOI and a lot stronger, I was lucky I made it safe as I was having very wild visuals and feeling very "floaty".

I just ate ~10 mg of ethacetin to get a feel of it. It's my first 4-sub ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif) The taste is horrid! I will have to find something better than water to chase it next time :S

I really like the empathogenic effects of it and how clean it feels on the body afterwards, including long lasting rejuvenating feeling, it's one of my favorite psychedelics.


Try natural lemonade or grapefruit juice - thats what I usually use for bitter compounds.

It actually felt somewhat strong! I was expecting a pretty mild experience but I was surprised I got to a light +3. I got some nausea off it, but I do have nausea on practically any compound, so... Maybe I should administer it rectally? I don't even know.

Now I understand why everyone was talking about that positive mindset in erowid! I was eating fruits and listening to snarky puppy and felt like the happiest man on earth ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

To avoid nausea, try taking the stuff on empty stomach and perhaps use strong menthol Halls mints and lemon balm extract if you have it handy and strong ginger tea - all are useful with nausea for me.

I find in general that the AcO esters have longer durations and actually lighter, easier to handle effects than their HO counterparts.

This one was extremely short lived for me. I was peaking at T+1 and at T+3 I came down quite abruptly. Took 0.5 clonazepam at T+5:30 and slept Ok.

Can you generalize regarding the difference in durations? Like an hour longer for the AcO esters.. or?

Not really, I just notice the development seems slower, and the total duration a little longer.  The hydroxys seem to reach a peak faster and more intensely.  I used to think 4-AcO-DMT was the exception, because I find it faster than mushrooms, but when I tried pure 4-HO-DMT several times, I found it even faster.  I also find there to be differences in subjective effects between the -HO and -AcOs, perhaps simply due to kinetics or maybe because the AcOs are also able to cross the BBB, I really don't know.  The differences are the most stark between 4-AcO-DMT and 4-HO-DMT, of the ones I've tried, those two are clearly distinct drugs for me.  Honestly I haven't eaten any of them very many times except the DMTs, 4-HO-MET and 4-HO-MiPT.  I have never tried 4-AcO-MiPT, but I have tried both 4-HO-DET and 4-AcO-DET, and both 4-HO-MET and 4-AcO-MET, and they each seem quite similar but the AcOs are a little more chilled out and lighthearted in general.  Probably because they reach the peak slower.


Actually I only tried 4-HO-DiPT a few times a long time ago, and I tried 4-AcO-DiPT a few times more recently, and if my memory serves the AcO was quite different from the HO, but also my reaction to psychedelics has changed a lot over that time so I really can't draw any conclusions.

4AcoDet is potent, 10mg would be a strong ++ and 16mg usually for +++.  Very similar to 4hodet.

I like 4-Aco-DET a lot (it's one of my favorite tryptamines) and would like to experiment with it more, particularly in combination with phenetylamines and Harmaline. I would like to extend that magical euphoric blissful state I get on it at the 2-3hr mark and make the come down less abrupt. I also very much enjoy the depth it provides for analytical thought.


As a phenetylamine candidates that's available I thought of Mescaline and all it's analogs (AL, MAL, Proscaline), perhaps even 3C-P, maybe 5-APDB or MDA (if available).


Please post if you tried combining it with anything!

I once smoked a tiny dose of 4acodet after a 2ct7 peak.  A most delightful state resulted, the visuals of the two together was spectacular.


Ive had a few good trips with it, and ethocin...but all in all, not as favored as miprocin and some of the others.  It is a very primal and earth shaking substitution...ethocin et al. Thanks Hoffman.

Agreed, the 4-substituted DETs produce a very powerful and serious trip.  They're not the ones I would take for a good time but I've had a really great trip on 4-AcO-DET, but the first half of it was quite unpleasant in many ways as I really got focused on my mortality and health and the fact that I'm not so young anymore.  On the same trip, my friend felt like he was being abducted by aliens while lying on the couch.  Very unearthly feeling thing, but also deeply personal, and for me, very little to no euphoria.  Kinda the opposite of 4-HO/AcO-MiPT, which I find to be very euphoric, centered, earthy and humorous.

Stragely, but miprocin (4-Aco/HO-MiPT) makes me waaay too agitated and adrenergic and the energy it gives me feels a bit alien compared to 4-Aco-DET. 


On one occasion on 40mg of miprocin in the wilderness I was deeply contemplating what it is to be a man - it sharpened my animalistic instincts of a hunter to the max, which was fun but I think I was acting a bit like a maniac and was pretty agressive towards everything. ![:sus:](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/suspicious.gif)

Miprocin is euphoric and colorful nevertheles but for me it almost always comes with chest pains and extreme stomach bloating, so my choice falls towards -DET's 4th subs! ![:p](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


Personal chemistry and metabolism is of the most importance when it comes to drugs of all kinds, I guess that's the reason why certain people get addicted to certain substances in general.

This one should be arriving next week aco and a small sample of the ho. I'll compare the two as close together as I can. Has anyone combined this with 4-aco-dmt or 4-aco-met? I will try it alone a few times first, it sounds more potent than the others. Looking forward to trying it.

I haven't noticed any significant differences between 4-HO-DET and 4-AcO-DET yet personally. Not saying there aren't any.


I love all the individual differences.... My response to these molecules is much closer to Xorkoth's, very serious, dark, unnatural, and lacking in euphoria. I definitely wouldn't describe them as empathogenic or having a positive mindset. I still find the 4-substituted DETs a lot like the DMT, MET, and MPT bases overall, but they've so far been consistently the strangest experiences of them all for me. Very powerful though.... More than most things I've taken. I'm really curious about higher doses.


I know I've heard very good things about the combination of 4-AcO-DET and 4-AcO-MET for visuals. These are two of the most visual drugs I've ever taken in relatively different ways from one another so I'd believe it.

Once I have run all the relevant tests and got a flavour for it in its own I will try a combo. As I said in another thread the combination of 4-AcO-DMT and 4-AcO-MET blew my mind in such a positive way.

The best visual combo I ever had was with LSD and PCP at once, dear mother of god...and here it's not smoked instant PCP, it's heavily cut with lactose powder so anyone can handle it without killing themselves or worse, snorting a gram was the regular thing last time I checked, didn't change, it's this way here since the 70's. So I would have PCP bumps and hot knive hits of weed and I was so lost, it wasn't pleasant, but it wasn't heavily judgmental in the comedown like with 4-aco-dmt, which was only pleasant for me once, all the other times I've been left feeling like philosophizing over my own life in very harsh terms that were not intrusive thoughts, they would be conclusions I would make from my thinking. I much prefer 4-aco-det and 4-HO-DET is god tier, although, I wish DET was legal here...i'm not sure, I  think in Canada only DOM and AET are banned when it comes to old psychedelics, well now all DOx are banned, thank you nbomes ban, you took away my 2c-x series with it too, you asshole bureaucrats.


Ahem, anyway, I looked in the scheduled and didn't see DET. But boy would I love trying it.

4-ho/aco-det is a difficult material.  I think every last trip Ive had on it has been difficult.  Have you guys read this one?


[Pain of The World](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=21144)


Trip was one month before the start of military action in Iraq, 2003.   I get shaky now thinking about that night.

^^^ I read this ([Pain of The World](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=21144)) before I got to try my 4-Aco-DET for the first time and thank you for such a detailed TR, **morninggloryseed**! It definitely pinpoints what needs to be! ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


4-Aco/HO-DET is the true entheogen IMO. It makes me respect it's power, not like many other psychs and with this one I always prepare spiritually. 

I think the trip on this will very strongly depend on the mindset and the way you let your thought process go. It's slowly dismantling your ego and perhaps that process gives me some weird pleasure I can't explain...8)

A friend of mine long ago who sold RCs was offering to give me a bunch of DET once because his girlfriend had just died and he was basically getting out of the whole thing so he could be a parent to her daughter.  Well, unfortunately he dropped off  the face of the earth. ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)  I have never seen DET or heard of it being available, but damn do I want to try it!

Certainly. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  I have wanted to try DET for it seems like forever... I remember some reports on DET were some of the early things I read on Erowid.  Strange that it's never been available.  Diethyl instead of dimethyl.... super interesting. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I remember reading this. Canadian news were showing how the entire planet, a couple million souls could not stop the PNAC/Clean Break. But now their plan is relatively failing, it's a small consolation.


4-aco-dmt I found really rought, for some reason 4-ho-det for me is like 4-ho-dpt and 4-ho-mipt, very recreational, 4-aco-det was a mix of 4-aco-dmt and 4-ho-det to me, the final part is like LSD can be, or 4-aco-dmt...very harsh, if you have an IQ over 100 and are not redpilled, prepare for racing thoughts of truth which will make you cower.


My last trip was with ETH-LAD and thankfully my girlfriend was there, she had AL-LAD herself, but AL-LAD hits her harder than it does for me yet the negativity and bad vibes do not come to her on AL-LAD, they don't to me on ETH-LAD, but I started focusing on my personal life a bit like the last time I used 4-aco-dmt at my birthday 2 years ago, very moody during the trippy part and then this visual-less space where you one by one thoughts of me not doing enough for the world and for people I love.....I always do what I think I can do do, but those things bring up new things I never though of before, and a very bad mood. So I had to abort at the 10th hour with 25mg seroquel and 6mg clonazolam. I slept soundly afterwards, but thankfully I was writing in Pluma (the linux equivalent of WordPad) all of those things and ideas and my subsconscious laughing at me because I didn't do something I didn't think of in my conscious mind. It was really harsh. I've had a similar trip on LSD 2 days after Operation Iraqi "Freedom" and I had the image of Wolf Blitzer being unhappy stuff was not exploding enough and I was enraged, I felt the rage of every human being left behind, thankfully I was immobile in my bed in the pensive mode, literally like the greek thinker statue. And although massively insightful, it was really painful, when the (strangely, I guess they were more moderate then, well they did offer Assad a pipeline from Qatar to Latakia, Syria and Assad refused, the last nail on his coffin was because he thought, intelligently to go with the Iran-Iran-Syria pipeline. Nevermind what the outside world think, also Syria had no central bank..is there a country that was humanitarianely bombed that wasn't playing the fiat money game left? But back then the Emir of Qatar said attacking Iraq would open the gates of Hell 2-3 weeks before the invasion and the discarding of the UN inspection everyone forgot about saying that Iraq had no WMD's, an extensive one that too from January to March 21st. March 23rd is on the Satanic Calendar as a feast (really, the Satanic religion is accepted in the US Army, Navy, Air Force, whatever, the guy who wrote the Chaplin's guide to religions for the US Army is the self-admitted Satanist Colonel Michael Aquino (who tried to steal some nukes, even the Sideshow Bob episode where he threatens TV to be turned off everywhere or else he was gonna detonate a nuke) was kinda based on how he managed to bring nukes outside the tight regulations, he had no triggers, but he wasn't doing that for nothing, he was arrested and put in prison temporarily, but never indicted of anything. And he included Satanism in the Chaplins' book for military brigs. That's fucked up.


The Emir of Al-Jazeerah, I mean Qatar...I gotta laugh even if the person who made the joke originally is a douchebag we thought was dead for almost half a year, Bandar Bush, called Qatar 300k people and a TV station, was pretty much right, Qatar wanted to play fair with Syria, but they contacted them for business too late...a twist of fate that pisses me off I gotta say, not sure there would still be war in Syria or Iraq if that happened. Remember it's all about energy wars when it comes down to it. Pepe Escobar's Pipelanistan is an amazing book.

Actually the last times I've had shrooms were pretty fun, the ratio of psilocin, psilocybin and yes even baeoceocystin or whatever the spelling, the most common outdoor shrooms here are a subspecies of cyanencecis or whatever, Psilocybe Quebecensis, and shrooms I never had a bad trip on, even the less hilarious parts felt more like being in my own bubble observing my friends play that Playstation 1 game that was so cool, it was just japanese fighting but pretty well made, I forgot, it was very popular in 2001 to say 2005, there was 3 games that I remember at least, my friends were coming down faster than I was, I remember going to the bathroom, and looking at myself in the mirror and the mirror looked like I was going on my ninja motorbike at 280 km/h on the highway, that was insanely pleasant, I do tend to retreat a bit even with friends with shrooms, but never that heavily as with 4-aco-dmt. 4-aco-dmt also made me produce so much mucus, like I would be choking if I wasn't spitting it out, my being was mad at me for smoking cigarettes, I stopped the year after when I got into vaping, but I had this mucus issue for a year after I stopped smoking cigs. It really was telling me to purge that shit out or I was gonna die of cancer in 5 years. I was smoking...to any Canadian here, the 2 strongest brands, Export A "Greens" which are nicknamed Green Death and when I had less money I'd go for a Mark Ten green or Number 7 Reds which is regular, anyway, they change it all 3-4 years ago when they stopped selling loose tobacco as Export A Blue as in medium, because it's the tubes that are Blue, it's all in the tubes and how much crap they let out. Hence why smoking Export A Reds once when I had a cold felt fine, they even say it in the pouches for tube rolling tobacco, the actual emissions from tobacco are related to the filter of the cigarette.


I once worked at a gas station at night in a very multicultural area of Montreal during the summer since in june and july, you don't get any grants and loans, so I found a job that was just 3 bus stops away, funny how big cities change...allure...so quickly, from the street I lived on, St-Michel boulevard was just fine, even was pretty much the center of the "Plateau" an often ridiculed gentrified area of Montreal with tiny condos for 199 999 dollars. Anyway, I lived up a slope in that boulevard which placed me into a tiny Ukrainian area, the guys at the convenience stores there all acted like dicks, so much that once I told, Ukraine wasn't ever a country before the Ukrainian SSR!! (which is the truth, but you can't say it), it was inside the Austro-Hungarian empire as Silesia and such. Russians called it the borderlands cos well ukraine means just that, borderlands. Border between polish and lithuanian from the Kievan Rus, they spoke a strange russian dilect which was pretty much considered redneck russian.


My god he got angry, he said I hope your pint of milk is rotten and thrown the change I gave him on the ground after he was like, what you wanna fight me? After I said the brand of cigs I wanted for 2 minutes and he still didn't get it. I'm not a geek I don't (didn't) smoke Peter Jacksons and he managed  to understand Peter Jackson when I said Benson and & Hedges Mint (it was for my girlfriend...no way would I smoke that dental floss tasting crap).


So yeah, my job was three bus stops north, in front of the east terminus of the Blue Line, the Northern Montreal line, the St-Michel station area is poor as shit but I felt safe since the cop shop was just a street behind me, I let idiot immigrants steal submarine sandwiches and stuff like that, it wasn't worth it, even my boss told me that, I once told one, hey man, I now you got a submarine hidden in your pants and he was all like (they were 2 cubans) "wanna see my submarine man yeah?" so I said fine keep it, so they try to buy Sprite can with a very french canadian name on it, I said I'm keeping that, that's a girl's name with a French Canadian name and then he said you want us to come back with my crew?" I said sure, I won't let you in with the buzzer, we'll break windows yadayada, never happened, but after that night, I looked in our backroom and for some reason there was a knife Billy Mays would have been proud to advertise for. Brand new, in it's original plastic cover. then I put it under my desk and then every smartass I would point a knife at, although it wasn't my computer training I passed in 45 minutes where the lady said, most people take 3 hours to do it and fail. I felt sad for the average joe without my wits...hard times are coming our way (~Cro-Mags) indeed. But it worked. The strangest thing though, came from a white guy, came outside while I was taking a smoke break, said, call the cops. I said why and he said "GET IN THERE AND CALL THE COPS" and so I did, and they treated him with the professionality of a Quebeec cop in general, even for an MPD (SPVM) pair of cops, they had him stay at a distance get on his knees and do the Hank on Walt thing.


Never knew what it was for, one cop came back inside said, you can re-open the store, but never told me what happened, but I expect he went nuts at his wife who nagged him to the maximum level of nagging a man can endure, so the inevitable (sarcasm alert..k, sjws? ). ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

See, the thing is, when you're on morning glory seeds, time dilation causes the apparent amount of time required to read a paragraph to be overwhelming, not to mention the bending and enlarging of text blocks.  So, when you ARE an actual morning glory seed... that shit gets tough quick.

Tried this one at 28mg (I have some tolerance due to recent tests) last night after an allergy test earlier in the day. Nice visuals but nothing too crazy. There was a darker undertone to this one compared to other subs but I was in a great mood and found cannabis really brought out the visuals.


it was a very generic trip but was a great headspace for introspection. Glad I tried it but not sure I would choose it over a combo of 4-ACO-MET and 4-ACO-DMT. 


I am am sure it would combo well with 4-ACO-MET and will certainly try this later in the year. Going on a break now to get the tolerance down. Will try This towards the end of the year.

i assume you mean p. cubensis? not to split hairs, but i thought it important to point out that there's a world of difference between, say, 1 gram of psilocybe stuntzii and 1g p. semilanceata.


back on track: not having tried these amine alkyl extension homologues of psilocin, they are sounding more and more useful in my mind; the cosmic profundity of the 5ht2a agonists ive tried can often get in the way of an otherwise very usable mindset for me. 


thanks for the report!

I recently acquired what was supposed to be 4-ACO-DET from a Canadian vendor but after conducting research it unfortunately is NOT 4-ACO-DET. 

 Years ago I researched almost an entire gram of this beautiful and gentle chem and have become quite fond of it. 30mgs being my sweet spot for deep introspection, awesome music enhancement and decent visuals. 

 2 mg of this new chem was taken for an allergy test a week before a 30mg dose. The 30mg dose took almost 1.5 hours to peak and lasted another 4 -5 hours. The peak had no visuals at all. The mind was very clear and focused and music enhancement was mild at best. It felt like a mild euphoric empathogen. Very similar to 5-meo-mipt at  6-8mgs.

Out of the chems they offer I'm very familiar with them all except for 4-HO-EPT, 4-ACO-McPT and 4-ACO-DPT. Ive searched trip reports for days and suspect the chem I have to be 4-ACO-McPT. Taking an unknown RC is scary enough but taking one that is possibly a MAOI, like 4-ACO-McPT is suspected to be, is just really scary.

Why would you take an unknown drug once you determined that it was not 4AcO-DET?


How do you know you dont have it? Reagent test, analytical instrumentation, melting point?

I have not taken it since it has been determined not to be 4-ACO-DET.

  I'm positive it isn't the right chemical because I've taken 4-ACO-DET approximately 25 times in the past at doses ranging from 20-40mgs and this is nothing like the previous 2 batches I've had. I also had a trip partner during this experience that took the same dosage and felt the effects to be nothing like 4-ACO-DET. 

 Now the only way to be positive on what it is is to have GC/MS conducted.   Reagents don't provide true confirmation on the exact chemical. I don't know if I want to pay 100$ to have it tested at the moment . I'm going to shelve it until I get some extra money to have it tested.

This thread is odd.


The first half of the thread, majority of posters cite the RC as a quick, easy feeling, visual heavy, almost light hearted psych similar to mushrooms but without the body load and "mind fuck" of the mushies.


The second half of the thread, majority of posters cite the RC as a heavy, mind changing, ego endangering psych similar to DMT.


My question, as someone looking to maybe purchase some, who should i believe?


I'm looking for a drug similar to what was described the first half of the thread. Just a fun little psych to experiment on with some buddies to have a fun little 4 hours. I'm not so much interested in shattering our world views and entering the matrix.


So, is this the RC for me?


(Note: My group is very experienced with low to mid/high doses of Mushrooms (1.75g to 5g) and LSD (1 to 2 tabs of decent to very good) probably over 70 unique trips of the 2.)

Well everyone is a bit different.  There is a camp that considers 4-HO-MiPT to be heavy and like mushrooms, and another camp (myself included) who considers it to be very euphoric and almost empathogenic, sociable, and not much like mushrooms at all.  In my opinion, 4-HO-MiPT or 4-HO-MET are the lightest and most euphoric 4-sub tryptamines, and the -DETs are more psychological and ego-threatening.

I've wondered this, too. I've never explored DET or it's substitutions in large part because there seems to be such extreme variation in reports. It's either extremely effervescent and light, or dark and serious.


xxx-xxx-MiPT reports have a bit of that, too, but that makes more sense to me. I've had many experiences where it felt like electro-cyberpunk euphoria, emotional gushing and turned up to 10. In other occasions (usually higher doses) it is more primal and jungley, but also twisted and weird. I reliably get some twisted experiences towards the tail end of my 4-HO-MiPT experiences which has kept me from exploring it enough to make sense out of the woods dichotomy

What is your usual dose of MiPT? Do you have a sweet spot dose that tends to keep things on the lighter side or is it just up to chance?

 Sorry, I definitely should have been more precise--my bad. I find *substituted *MiPT reports have a bit of that. My experiences with MiPT analogues can't adequately be generalized, and I imagine the same would hold true of DET and its substitutions. They're all pretty different, apart from the 4-HO and 4-AcO subs, which are more similar for me. I'll answer the rest of this question in the 4-AcO-MiPT thread that you're active in.

Think I'm going to get this, maybe the HO version.


Experiences seem divided, but as some people really seem to like this, I'm just going for it.


Maybe it will combine well with some of my other tryptamines, any good combo's with this one?

I found it less fun than others and somewhat dark and edgy but not in a bad way.  It's pretty confronting but that can be good.  I've only taken it twice (and it was HO version), but the last time I took it, my friend and I each had I think 30mg.  I had an experience that confronted me with my mortality and the theme was very much of decay and death, which wasn't fun, but after the peak I resolved it and started playing music and it ended very nicely.  My friend was so high he started feeling this buzzing and laid down and had an alien abduction experience and to this day says it's the hardest he's ever tripped.

I have this compulsive need to keep buying new drugs, probably very recognizable for people here. This seems one of the more obscure and unique compounds that is more widely available.

Going to be sampling this one soon and I'm really excited about it. Been reading trip reports about it all week long. Planning on taking a 5mg dose of the 4-AcO-DET after the initial allergy test takes place. After learning of some other BLers experiences with the compound don't think I'll take it above 15mgs.


I'm really sensitive to 4 subs and will probably really enjoy this one. It sounds like a pretty potent Tryptamine. Was given this bag for free so if I'm not into its not like I'm losing cash on a order. I have a feeling it will shine. In lower doses and I'll have rewarding collection of experiences.

I just found I still have some maybe 50mgs or so but it's degraded into a black chunky powder. Do you think it's still even active; it was stored well but I know tryptamines aren't that stable and from past experience degraded tryptamines tend to produce uncomfortable trips. Thinking of maybe trying to plug a tiny dose just to test it out.

Yeah I would still take it. I'm going to be doing my first 4-AcO-DET trial tommorow. Probably will take 1-2mgs early in the day and if all goes well with the allergy im gonna dose 6-7mgs more a couple hours later. Just really trying to see what I'm working with at this point.


Phenethylo J if I was in your shoes id probably take it more than likely. The stuff I have is from a fresh synth and it's a very white color. Did your start off this way and slowly turn to Black. I'm going to keep it frozen so I hope it's gonna last.

Thanks for the link kaleida. I find 4-ho-det more warm and positive than 4-aco-det so it's neat that it converts to it. It  was a light tannish brown when I first got it; kinda between the first two pics on the left.

Opened the bag Looked closer and saw it was more of a very dark brown than black now. Turned out to be exactly 50mgs. Prob will take it tomorrow with some mxe.

It is definitely true that acetoxy esters do convert to their hydroxy counterparts in vivo.  However it's likely that the acetoxy esters are also able to cross the BBB and are active in their own right.  My theory on why there is a variance in effects, but just for some people (some people, like myself, find the AcO and HO versions to be substantially different, especially in some like 4-AcO and 4-HO-DMT), is that depending on individual metabolic factors, some people convert the AcO to the HO pretty completely before it is able to cross the BBB, hence they are mostly or completely getting the effects of the HO version.  Whereas others convert it more slowly so they're getting much of their dose as the AcO itself.  There is no way you could convince me I wouldn't be able to almost instantly tell 4-AcO-DMT and 4-HO-DMT apart (I have had pure 4-HO-DMT a handful of times to compare, besides just mushrooms which have additional differences).  It's not just a difference in absorption speed, 4-AcO-DMT feels just like smoked DMT, but much slower and less intense.  Whereas 4-HO-DMT does not.  As soon as it starts to hit I can tell because it feels like I just toked some DMT but it's unfolding at like 100 times slower speed.  But some people say 4-AcO-DMT feels exactly the same as mushrooms/4-HO-DMT.

Yeah I ended up taking 4-AcO-DET a number of times, in the 25-30mg range I liked it most and it was pretty visual and euphoric. Less of a mindfuck than 4-AcO-DMT as in not really forceful. Had this eerie sorta feeling to it when I dosed lower amounts and a dark sorta vibe. But when you pushed the dose it was more similar to the other 4-Subs. I'd given out parts of my sample to other two of my friends so that they would get to try it out also, I think I'd ended up eating 250mgs over a few months. I'd like to try 4-HO-DET at some point in the future and see how it compares.

Have tried 4AcO-det in the dosage range from 7-50mg and was always satisfied with its effects. It’s not the best acylated tryptamine out there but definitely a good go to tryptamine that always produces solid effects.

how would you compare it with 4-ho-mipt and 4-ho-met? maybe something in the middle? 

 I do like the earthy alien-ness of shrooms but sometimes I prefer the sharp perspective of 4-ho-mipt (more than the giggly-ether-void of ho-met..).

Does it has any specific traits that other tryptamines doesn't (or not so distinctively)?

It's a lot like DPT (lol). More so than any other tryptamine I've tried in the ways that are really meaningful, including 4-HO-DPT. Smoking 30 mg of 4-AcO-DET gave me open eye visuals that were the most like so-called "true hallucinations" of any psychedelic I've ever ingested except for extremely high dosages of LSD, and they were still more complex than those visuals on LSD are. It was like seeing Renaissance paintings of an alternating angelic and demonic netherworld plastered on the walls around me and coming to life like in Harry Potter. I've literally never experienced anything else like it. 4-HO-MiPT and 4-HO-MET are both poor comparisons other than the fact that they're all very active 4-substituted tryptamines with some general similarities that most drugs in that class share, although when thinking about a comparison to 4-HO-MET, it seems easiest to grasp how they may both draw somewhat from the same well of strong visuals, but they still have pretty different styles in the end. 4-AcO-DET and 4-HO-DET for me are the 4-substituted tryptamines that are the most alike mushrooms yet at the same time the most lax and sort of dissociative alike 4-HO-DPT, which I guess isn't that surprising. I personally think anyone is missing out if they want to see what all 4-substituted tryptamines can do but skip the DETs.

Then which one I could skip? I thought in trying DPTs and DETs first, then perhaps trying DiPTs. Which are your favourites?

It was incredible and somehow not alarming in the slightest, which is part of the point I was trying to get at with this type of psychedelic in the 4-HO-DPT thread. It was terribly "dark" but only in theme, not in feeling. The trip was ridiculously smooth and easy for what it was. I took a shower and brushed my teeth while all that was going on.

That's a slightly complex question that depends on the substitution in question.


DiPT itself is highly novel and interesting for obvious reasons but you really shouldn't even consider it unless you want your trip to be one that focuses on its unique auditory components. There is more to it than that too but that will play a dominant role and it makes hard to compare and contrast with other psychedelics overall. In general though I am a fan of the DiPTs, but they're a bit different from the DETs and DPTs. All isopropyl tryptamines I've tried (the base, 4-HO, and 5-MeO of both the MiPTs and DiPTs as well as specifically just 5-MeO-EiPT) seem to have a handful of qualities that they relatively share and which somewhat distinguish them from tryptamines with straight chains (methyl, ethyl, propyl) which they also otherwise have some but not all of the shared qualities of in my experience. It's not the easiest thing to put into words but I tend to say that their ratio and style of effects tend to remind me somewhat more of lysergamides and phenethylamines than other tryptamines do and less so of other tryptamines than I usually expect. They do share a certain depth with other tryptamines nonetheless. This dichotomy tends to work extremely well in their favor as the overall package tends to be a little bit unlike anything else you can find. I find the sensory visuals they produce to be highly ornate, often quite digital, and relatively uniquely colored, although they're significantly easier to get on the MiPTs than the DiPTs. The visuals of DiPT and 4-HO-DiPT are actually astoundingly silver for me in a way unlike anything else I've encountered, although 5-MeO-DiPT's visuals are very red for me similarly to those of 5-MeO-MiPT. Something that stands out about the DiPTs to me is that they all have the capacity to be weirdly sexually stimulating for psychedelics, and I don't mean they're necessarily sexy in and of themselves like I usually mean about psychedelics, I mean they will directly make you very horny regardless (or they can, at least). People think this about the MiPTs and tell themselves 5-MeO-MiPT must be a fine 5-MeO-DiPT replacement but it's really not the same. The DiPTs in general also seem to be somewhat forgiving mentally although it is very possible to get too high to remember or tell what's going on on them and they can hit you pretty hard especially when they first kick in, which the non-base ones tend to do particularly quickly even when taken orally.


Aside from some of the ratios of visual to visionary effects in certain examples, the DETs are stylistically more alike the DiPTs for me than the DPTs are. They can be kind of weirdly sexually stimulating but tend to get bogged down in being more classically mushroom-like instead than the DiPTs do, but do still have a bit of LSD- and phenethylamine-likeness, more so with the former I would say though whereas the DiPTs lean heavier into the latter. I've only tried 4-HO-DET and 4-AcO-DET though, so my perspective on them is limited to the 4-substituted tryptamines. In general, I think I would have to say it would be easier for me to compare the DETs and DiPTs and part of a decision between them and the DPTs would be easy for me to figure based on the context of the trip I wanted. If you want something that's going to be more like the speed and duration of DMT and powerful in that base tryptamine sort of way, even if not the same kind of trip, you should pretty much go for DPT. 4-HO-DPT is on the other end of the scale, its speed and duration will be more like mushrooms but the trip will be notably different, and I described it elsewhere already, but basically I wouldn't choose it unless I wanted something more laid back and visionary but easygoing, and good for just chilling and feeling good on. If you do want something that feels more like a classical psychedelic trip instead, I would be inclined to go with either one of the DETs or one of the DiPTs over one of the DPTs. The DETs will likely be more obviously unique from the classics nonetheless than the DiPTs are but not necessarily in a way that's fun, I would choose them in particular if you're more interested in something that might cut deep but be worthwhile in the end. The DiPTs have this potential too but they're more likely to be recreational in my experience. I would probably say something like if you want something more like mushrooms go for the DETs, if you want something more like LSD go for the DiPTs, and if you want something more unique from either go for the DPTs.


5-MeO-DiPT may be my favorite of all of these molecules, although I worry about it making me go insane now. It's the one that reminds me the most of the kind of trip I fell in love with.

Incredibly detailed report, it really shows your experience and rigour while analyzing compounds...

I'm quite interested in DiPT itself cause I see myself more an acoustic person than a visual person, I would prefer to be blind (or at least to see badly) than to be completely deaf, that would block a very important part of myself. 

Never tried any DiPT, DETs or DPTs but I'm interested in those, more than let's say MPT or EPT. 

I've read that Foxy could be even more sexual than Moxy and for that's saying much cause I get really horny on 5-meo-mipt, at least in high-ish doses, it affects my libido and enhances a lot of aspects of the erotic experience, including imagination. The problem I see with the sexual aspect of Moxy is that its headspace is slightly dissociating, so I'm never 100% fully into it.

I would like to see if the DiPT is different in that respect and more bodily oriented, since MiPTs tend to be, for me, quite balanced between body and mind, and ho-mipt probably more mental than body oriented (but I've been hit by sudden horniness in high doses of 4-ho-mipt too). I've had silvery visuals with ho-mipt, very beautiful, once. 

How's the headspace for the DiPTs?


I would take your advices in mind when ordering, probably I'll do soon so I can select a couple things to try, I love trying new tryptamines and psychs in general.  Probably could get 1 of each, 4-ho-dpt, 4-ho-det and 5-meo-dipt.

I will wait a bit to do the base trypts I aim for first: MET and DiPT.

Oh! forgot about this part..

I thought, when I read it, that I've lived those moments, where you cannot believe what you are seeing and how crazy/creepy it IS but you somehow don't feel any sense of panic or dread, it's just there and you're "interested" in seeing how it can develop, like in a very neutral way.

I think this is related, sometimes, with the serenity psychs tend to manifest (in me at least) and also the body high. In fact I think I would have gone crazy if DMT didn't have a totally blissful body high that sustain you in the feeling of total power/inviolability, because otherwise I don't know how I would felt while watching those totally otherworldly visions.

Hey wanted to chime in they're selling gummies with 4mgs of 4 aco det in them at headshops. {Sourcing not permitted} I'm almost positive has it in it and {sourcing not permitted} states they put 4 aco det in the gummies and shows a COA with the results.


I got 2 of the {sourcing not perrmitted} gummies as a free sample I'll be trying them before long. I've done shrooms probably less than 10 times and DMT like 8 times I've always been more into LSD and phenethylamines and dissociatives.


 I have not tried any of the 4 sub tryptamines so this will be my first! I'm almost positive that they dose the same as {sourcing not permitted} based on the trip reports as well so it'll be an 8 mgs trip. I also have a bag of salvia as I have been exclusively using salvia for the last 2 years.


 But my friend gave me some nitrous the other day 1 balloon and I literally went into hyperspace saw like infinite fractals and couldn't see reality at all like one of those YouTube videos. I've done massive doses of hallucinogens including DMT and never had visuals that intense before so I think that sorta sparked my interest in serotonergics again. Also have been contemplating getting some Glaucine seems very novel and interesting.

Yesterday I tried some "Psilocybe cubensis gummies" that my friend gifted me, knowing full well that it's probably not as advertised. Each gummy is supposedly a "1000mg macro dose". I ended up taking two.


First alerts in T+10 minutes. The experience lasted about 4 hours, was a light +++, and was clear and mellow (I smoked weed through the second half). Quite enjoyable but nothing crazy.


What was in them? It certainly didn't feel like any tryptamine that I've tried (and I've used a bunch). As it so happens, I've been sitting on some 4-aco-det for many years that I haven't yet sampled. Soon enough I will do so and find out if that's what it was.

I've used pure ethocin, and it's ambiguous enough to where I'd likely have a tough time telling it apart from just a low dose of other 4-substituted tryptamines. I'd definitely send a sample out to a lab if you want an accurate ID.

4-ACO-MET or 4-HO-MET? No way of knowing but those are both very gentle. "Clear and mellow" as you described

How would people here advise combining ethocin with other compounds (especially other psychedelics) to make it less boring?

I actually quite liked it on its own. I enjoyed its character, especially compared to things like 4-HO-DiPT.

Unfortunately, most labs won't be able to ID what's in a gummy, and I don't have the spare cash that would be required for the ones that do.

Interesting that you're saying that... My first thought was "this isn't even a tryptamine" but obviously I can't really know that. Still, doesn't seem at all similar to any of the tryptamines that I'm very familiar with (4-aco-dmt, 4-pro-dmt, 4-ho-met, 4-aco-mipt)...

Nope. FWIW, I don't find 4-ho-met to be particularly clear/mellow but perhaps I'm anomalous. Fun and easy, yes, but not clear-headed for me.

Why do you say this? you dissolve the gummy in water basify and then extract with a non polar solvent like ethyl acetate. The process is a little more intense than say testing a powder, but it's still very simple, especially in regards to identification. Quantifying what's actually in the gummy is definitely harder.

Tragically many labs just refuse to do this amount of work, despite how minimal it is. Many of these recent gummies too have tested negative for any indoles upon extraction which I find strange, makes me wonder what's in them. Experience reports are highly entactogenic, makes me wonder if a small amount of a benzofuran is in there or something, idk.

Admittedly I'm limiting myself to the almost free (by donation) Canadian lab that does FTIR. I'm know other labs could do better. They have tested many gummies and most (all?) turned up nothing which is surely a limitation of their method/equipment.

Oh that's pretty interesting. In my test though I had strong first alerts at 10 minutes which I assume would rule out a benzofuran? I've never done any so I couldn't comment one way or the other about comparison to what I took.


What I did notice was that what I took was surprisingly light on the visuals, which is unusual for me with most psychedelics...

6-APB took something like 60-90 minutes to finish coming up, with first alerts ~45-60 minutes after oral administration. Intranasally it was faster, but really stressed my heart to an extensive degree, I had this whacked out batch that was widely reported by other users on that DNM as being overwhelmingly active ~75mg, with threshold doses as low as 5-10mg, but reagent tests, drugsdata's mass spec, and experienced effects all aligned with 6-APB. To this day I think back on that as a highly peculiar batch of an RC.

I recall a few months ago, the FDA tested some mushroom chocolate bars and some were found to contain no psilocin/psilocybin, and instead had 4-aco-dmt and a couple kava alkaloids.

While searching for the above, I found this one on gummies, some of which DO contain psilocin/psilocybin.

Ok, so here's the deal.


About two weeks ago I sampled 4-aco-det for the first time at 16mg. The experience was extremely subtle: ++. Is my stash degraded? It's a smallish sample that I never tried that is 15 years old, but it has been stored in the freezer and looks perfect/white. 


Anyway, fast forward to last night when I decided to try 32mg. At first I found it extremely uncomfortable and a bit too much. At one point I thought I might need to throw up but didn't. (My stomach hadn't been great all day, so I'm sure that played a part.) And then, in the midst of not knowing what to do with myself and feeling not so great, something caught my eyes and my ears and I found myself bathed in infinite sensation and........


**++++**


Holy fuck. Selfing ceased. Ecstasy. It only lasted about 10 minutes (I think?) but it was as powerful as a DMT trip. Later in the trip it once happened again for a shorter amount of time. Worth mentioning that I've been deep into a particular meditation practice for a few years which has only recently come to fruition. Related? Possible, but who knows. I won't say more here, but feel free to PM me.


(As for those gummies I mentioned in a previous post... Based on this experience I don't think that they were 4-aco-det. Super mysterious.)

My interest in 4-ACO-DET stems from the fact that I read years ago, probably somewhere on this site, that 4-ACO-DET is more prone to producing ++++ experiences than other psychedelics. I've only tried it once at under 14mg in a social setting so I didn't get the most of it. I'm happy for you that you got to experience that ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

What dose would get someone tripping to the equivalent of say, a tenstrip of good acid or 12-14 grams of good cubensis mushrooms? I'm extremely hard headed to psychedelics in general, but may be and to use a lower dose and just boost it up with DPT, DOB, 2C-B, 25I-NBOMe, 25B-NBOH, 4-HO-MET, 4-HO-MiPT, mushrooms, 4-AcO-DMT, peyote, allylescaline, mescaline citrate, HBWR seeds, MDMB-4en-PINACA, HHC, DXM, THC-O, DiPT, or 5-MeO-DiPT. Does anybody here think that any of those would be specifically worth mixing with 4-HO-DET, and if so, in what dosage ranges for a seriously hard-headed psychedelic enthusiast.


Edit: Forgot to mention THC-H, THC-P and THC-B.

Does anyone know how this would compare to the fake "amanita gummies" - from awhile back where someone who considered themselves a veteran, said it was without a doubt 4-ACO-DMT..then I heard oh you never know could even be 4-aco-det? 


I know next to nothing with these new rc or whatever psychedelic compounds, except experiences I have had on those gummies. (Mild CEV and possibly even light OEV, a bit of fractal and distortion BUT very very mild compared to even a low dose mushroom trip). 


 My question is if they are all in the same boat? Is it weaker or stronger than DET? Or is 4- aco- dmt a whole different thing?  I've heard it's an amazing substance like it was Hella intense visuals or something, but my oral gummies(god knows what dose really is in each gummy let alone 4aco.) never got me too far..psychedelic but never blasts off.

No one would be able to tell you based on the effects if it was 4-aco-dmt, 4-aco-det, or something else, unless those gummies have been tested. 


These are two synthetic tryptamines that are similar in structure to psilocybin (chemical name 4-PO-DMT) found in mushrooms. IF the gummies happened to contain a synthetic tryptamine, it was probably a low dose. Not that I recommend eating more of them, just that was probably the reason for a lack of "blast off".

All of these tryptamines can result in strong trips, dose dependent.
