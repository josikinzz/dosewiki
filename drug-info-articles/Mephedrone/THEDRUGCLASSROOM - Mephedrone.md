# 4-MMC (Mephedrone)
*Source: https://thedrugclassroom.com/video/4-mmc-mephedrone/*

4-MMC is a stimulant, euphoriant, and to a lesser extent, an entactogen. While it was synthesized decades ago, the drug only has a short history of use. It’s a substituted amphetamine and it comes from the cathinone family.

The stimulation it provides lends itself to physical activities like dancing. Since it’s usually described as “forced,” the stimulation can be uncomfortable.

Its euphoria and stimulation can surpass what is provided by MDMA, though MDMA has more pronounced entactogenic effects. 4-MMC is often redosed and unless subsequent doses are planned ahead of time, using more is not a good idea. Redosing without carefully considering your dose can result in dangerous levels of 4-MMC being administered and it can also increase the drug’s negative after effects.

Vasoconstriction is an established issue with the substance and it can be dangerous with strong doses, which are sometimes encountered due to redosing. Neurotoxicity also appears to be a concern with higher doses and its neurotoxicity may be additive with MDMA and methamphetamine’s.
