## Subjective Experience

I became aware that this was one of the big hitters courtesy of forum reports.
Notably, blackouts were reported here and there, and addiction was cited all too
frequently. Accordingly, its fear-factor was set on high, and my foray was always
going to be ultra-cautious, and a one-off.

I struggle to report more detail largely because it delivered more or less what I was
expecting. This, specifically, was sedation and sleep. The following day wasn’t
particularly foggy, as I recall.

At time of writing I still have a couple of the little yellow capsules sitting in my
drawer of goodies, but as with most benzos, I haven’t been particularly motivated to
dip into them again.

I suggest that this is one to use only in exceptional circumstances.

- Heavy: 999 ug +

**Duration:**
- Total: 6 - 10 hours
- Onset: 10 - 30 minutes
**Fatal [overdose](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Overdose) may occur when [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) are combined with other [depressants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressants) such as [opiates](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opiates) , [barbiturates](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Barbiturates) , [gabapentinoids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Gabapentinoids) , [thienodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thienodiazepines) , [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) or other [GABAergic substances](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GABA#GABA_receptors) .**
 
It is strongly discouraged to combine these substances, particularly in [common](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Common) to [heavy](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Heavy) doses.
**Clonazolam** (also known as **Clonitrazolam** ) is a novel [depressant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressant) substance of the [benzodiazepine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine) chemical class which produces [anxiolytic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiolytic) , [sedative](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedative) , [muscle relaxant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_relaxant) , and [amnesic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amnesic) effects when [administered](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Routes_of_administration) . This compound is a novel [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) derivative of the FDA-approved drugs [clonazepam](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Clonazepam) ( **Klonopin** , **Rivitrol** ) and [alprazolam](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alprazolam) ( **Xanax** ). Clonazolam is reported to be roughly 2.5x as potent as alprazolam.

The synthesis of clonazolam was first reported in 1971. It was described as the most active compound in the series tested. Clonazolam is reputed to be highly potent, and concerns have been raised that it and [flubromazolam](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Flubromazolam) may pose comparatively higher risks than other designer benzodiazepines due to their ability to produce strong sedation and amnesia at oral doses as low as 0.5 mg, or 500 micrograms (µg). It is reported to have a medium-length onset of action (20 - 60 minutes).

Very little is known about this substance, but it has recently become easily accessible through online [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) vendors where it is being sold as a [designer drug](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Designer_drug) . Due to its extremely high potency, it is often found on blotter paper or in [volumetrically dosed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Volumetric_dosing) solutions. Ingestion of raw clonazolam powder is unsafe due to its microgram-range potency and the ease in which it can lead to multi-day blackouts.

[Sudden discontinuation of benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine#Discontinuation) can cause seizures (which may be life-threatening in certain cases ) for individuals who have been heavily using them for a prolonged period of time. For this reason, it is recommended to gradually lower the daily dose over a period of time instead of stopping abruptly — a technique known as [tapering](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tapering) .

Due to the high dependence-forming and addiction potential that this substance shares with other members of the [benzodiazepine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine) class, as well as its [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) -like ability to induce dangerously [disinhibited](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Disinhibition) [black-out](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amnesia) states, it is strongly advised to use proper [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Harm_reduction_practices) if choosing to use this substance.

## Chemistry

Clonazolam is a drug of the [benzodiazepine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine) class. Benzodiazepine drugs contain a benzene ring fused to a diazepine ring, which is a seven membered ring with the two nitrogen constituents located at R 1 and R 4 . The benzyl ring of clonazolam is substituted at R 8 with a nitro group, NO 2 -. Further, the diazepine ring is bonded at R 6 to a 2-chlorinated phenyl ring.

Clonazolam also contains a 1-methylated triazole ring fused to and incorporating R 1 and R 2 of its diazepine ring. Clonazolam belongs to a class of [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) containing this fused triazole ring, called triazolobenzodiazepines, distinguished by the suffix "-zolam." Clonazolam is also a nitrobenzodiazepine, a subclass of benzodiazepines which contain a nitro (NO 2 -) group. Other nitrobenzodiazepines include [clonazepam](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Clonazepam) and flunitrazepam.

## Pharmacology

Benzodiazepines produce a variety of effects by binding to the benzodiazepine receptor site and magnifying the efficiency and effects of the neurotransmitter [gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA)](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GABA) by acting on its [receptors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Receptor) . As this site is the most prolific inhibitory receptor set within the brain, its modulation results in the [sedating](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedating) (or [calming effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety_suppression) ) of Clonazolam on the nervous system.

The [anticonvulsant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anticonvulsant) properties of benzodiazepines may be, in part or entirely, due to binding to voltage-dependent sodium channels (VDSC) rather than benzodiazepine receptors. Clonazolam is hydroxylated, and is mainly reduced to the 7-amino benzodiazepine and then acetylated.

In a series of triazolobenzodiazepines, it was the most active overall, sometimes proving effective at under 10 μg/kg in mice.

## Subjective effects

Clonazolam is reported to be similar to alprazolam and other benzodiazepines that suppress emotions and produce moderate-strong feelings of relaxation, pleasure and comfort in the body. This seems to present itself more often in those with pre-existing anxiety. Many anecdotal reports from users of this compound have stated it as being one of the most euphoric benzodiazepines.

The cognitive effects of clonazolam are thought to be mainly amnesic, but also include most other typical effects seen with benzodiazepines. Clonazolam is reported to cause "blackouts" at a higher rate than other benzodiazepines.

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation)** - Clonazolam has the potential to be extremely sedating and often results in an overwhelmingly lethargic state. At higher levels, this causes users to suddenly feel as if they are extremely sleep deprived and have not slept for days, forcing them to sit down and generally feel as if they are constantly on the verge of passing out instead of engaging in physical activities. This sense of sleep deprivation increases proportional to dosage and eventually becomes powerful enough to force a person into complete unconsciousness.
- **[Muscle relaxation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_relaxation)** - This effect is particularly strong when compared to other benzodiazepines such as [alprazolam](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alprazolam) .
- **[Motor control loss](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motor_control_loss)** - This effect is particularly strong when compared to other benzodiazepines. Losing your balance can become easy incredibly quickly if not careful. Holding onto a wall or rail is sometimes necessary due to the severe inability to walk straight.
- **[Dizziness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dizziness)**
- **[Increased libido](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_libido)**
- **[Respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression)** ### Visual effects
 
- - **[Visual acuity suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_acuity_suppression)** - Like many [depressants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressants) , Clonazolam is known to cause blurred or otherwise suppressed visual acuity in higher doses. ### Paradoxical effects
 
- Paradoxical reactions to [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) such as increased seizures (in epileptics), aggression, increased anxiety, violent behavior, loss of impulse control, irritability and suicidal behavior sometimes occur (although they are rare in the general population, with an incidence rate below 1%). 
These paradoxical effects occur with greater frequency in recreational abusers, individuals with mental disorders, children, and patients on high-dosage regimes. ### Cognitive effects
 
- - **[Anxiety suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety_suppression)**
- **[Amnesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amnesia)** - Clonazolam is reported to cause "blackouts" at a higher rate than other benzodiazepines.
- **[Disinhibition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Disinhibition)**
- **[Euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Euphoria)** - A distinct portion of users report feeling a marked sense of emotional well-being and comfort while under the influence of this substance. Because this does not occur regularly or consistently for most users, it is speculated that this effect only manifests among those who have unusually high baseline levels of anxiety. However, people without anxiety issues also report clonazolam as being euphoric.
- **[Compulsive redosing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Compulsive_redosing)**
- **[Emotion suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Emotion_suppression)** - Although this compound primarily suppresses anxiety, it also dulls other emotions in a manner which is distinct but less intensive than that of antipsychotics.
- **[Delusions of sobriety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions)** - This is the false belief that one is perfectly sober despite obvious evidence to the contrary such as severe cognitive impairment and an inability to fully communicate with others. It most commonly occurs at heavy dosages.
- **[Memory suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Memory_suppression)** - Clonazolam primarily suppresses short-term memory, resulting in forgetfulness, and/or disorganized behaviors.
- **[Analysis suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Analysis_suppression)**
- **[Motivation suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motivation_suppression)** - Due to clonazolam's heavy sedation and lethargy, doing any type of activity that requires moving, or high amounts of effort may be difficult to do on this compound, especially at higher doses.
- **[Thought deceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_deceleration)**
- **[Language suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Language_suppression)** - Clonazolam & most benzodiazepines are known to cause slurred speech and difficulty communicating words in a clear fashion.
- **[Sleepiness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sleepiness)** ### After effects
 
- - **[Rebound anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety)** - Rebound anxiety is a commonly observed effect with [anxiety relieving](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety_suppression) substances like [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) and [etizolam](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Etizolam) . It typically corresponds to the total duration spent under the substance's influence along with the total amount consumed in a given period, an effect which can easily lend itself to cycles of dependence and addiction.
- **[Dream potentiation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dream_potentiation)** or **[Dream suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dream_suppression)**
- **[Residual sleepiness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sleepiness)** - While clonazolam can be used as an effective [sleep-inducing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hypnotic) aid, its effects may persist into the morning afterwards, which may lead users to feeling "groggy" or "dull" for up to a few hours.
- **[Thought deceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_deceleration)**
- **[Thought disorganization](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_disorganization)**
- **[Irritability](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Irritability)**
- **[Motivation suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motivation_suppression)**

## Common usage

### Preparation methods

- **[Volumetric liquid dosing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Volumetric_liquid_dosing)** - If one's benzodiazepines are in powder form, they are unlikely to weigh out accurately without the most expensive of scales due to their extreme potency. Clonazolam is especially important to weigh out and volumetrically dose properly due to it being active in the microgram range. To avoid adverse effects, one can dissolve the [benzodiazepine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine) volumetrically into a solution and dose it accurately based upon the methodological instructions linked within this tutorial [here](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Volumetric_liquid_dosing) .

## Toxicity and harm potential

Clonazolam likely has a low toxicity relative to dose. However, it is potentially lethal when mixed with [depressants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressants) like [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) or [opioids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioids) .

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Harm_reduction_practices) , such as [volumetric dosing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Volumetric_dosing) , when using this substance to ensure the accurate administration of the intended dose.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

Clonazolam is generally considered to be extremely physically and psychologically addictive.

Tolerance will develop to the sedative-hypnotic effects within a couple of days of continuous use. After cessation, the tolerance returns to baseline in 7 - 14 days. However, in certain cases, this may take significantly longer in a manner which is proportional to the duration and intensity of one's long-term usage.

Clonazolam presents cross-tolerance with all [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) , meaning that after its consumption all benzodiazepines will have a reduced effect.

### Discontinuation and withdrawal

Benzodiazepine discontinuation is notoriously difficult; it is potentially life-threatening for individuals using regularly to discontinue use without tapering their dose over a period of weeks. There is an increased risk of [high blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/High_blood_pressure) , [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) , and death. Substances which lower the seizure threshold such as [tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol) should be avoided during withdrawal. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] Abrupt discontinuation also causes rebound stimulation which presents as [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [insomnia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness) and restlessness. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

If one wishes to discontinue after a period of regular use, it is safest to reduce the dose each day by a very small amount for a couple of weeks until close to abstinence. If using a short half-life benzodiazepine such as [alprazolam](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alprazolam) or [etizolam](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Etizolam) , a longer acting variety such as [diazepam](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Diazepam) or [clonazepam](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Clonazepam) can be substituted. Symptoms may still be present, but their severity will be reduced significantly.

For more information on tapering from benzodiazepines in a controlled manner, please see [this guide](http://www.benzo.org.uk/manual/bzcha02.htm) . Small quantities of [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) can also help to reduce the symptoms, but otherwise cannot be used as an effective tapering agent.

The duration and severity of withdrawal symptoms depend on a number of factors including the half-life of the substance used, tolerance and the duration of abuse. Major symptoms will usually start within just a few days after discontinuation and persist for around a week for shorter lasting benzodiazepines. Benzodiazepines with longer half-lives will exhibit withdrawal symptoms with a slow onset and extended duration. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

### Overdose

Benzodiazepine overdose may occur with extremely high doses or, more commonly, when it is taken with other [depressants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressants) . This risk is especially present with other [GABAergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GABA) depressants, such as [barbiturates](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Barbiturate) and [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) , since they work in a similar fashion but bind to distinct sites on the GABA A receptor, resulting in significant cross-potentiation. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

Benzodiazepine overdose is a medical emergency that may lead to a coma, permanent brain injury or death if not treated promptly. Symptoms may include severe [slurred speech](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Language_suppression) , [confusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Confusion) , [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) , [respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression) , and non-responsiveness. The user might seem like they are sleepwalking. The user is also more susceptible to consume more of the same or another substance due to their impaired judgement, which is typically not seen with other substances during overdose.

Benzodiazepine overdoses may be treated effectively in a hospital environment, with generally favorable outcomes. Care is primarily supportive in nature, although overdoses are sometimes treated with [flumazenil](/w/index.php?title=Flumazenil&action=edit&redlink=1) , a GABA A antagonist or additional procedures such as [adrenaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Adrenaline) injections if other substances are involved. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **Depressants** ( *[1,4-Butanediol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/1,4-Butanediol) , [2M2B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2M2B) , [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) , [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) , [barbiturates](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Barbiturates) , [GHB](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GHB) / [GBL](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GBL) , [methaqualone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methaqualone) , [opioids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioids)* ) - This combination potentiates the [muscle relaxation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_relaxation) , [amnesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amnesia) , [sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation) , and [respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression) caused by one another. At higher doses, it can lead to a sudden, unexpected loss of consciousness along with a dangerous amount of depressed respiration. There is also an increased risk of suffocating on one's vomit while unconscious. If [nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea) or vomiting occurs before a loss of consciousness, users should attempt to fall asleep in the [recovery position](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Recovery_position) or have a friend move them into it.
- **Dissociatives** - This combination can unpredictably potentiate the [amnesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amnesia) , [sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation) , [motor control loss](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motor_control_loss) and [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) that can be caused by each other. It may also result in a sudden loss of consciousness accompanied by a dangerous degree of [respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression) . If [nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea) or vomiting occurs before consciousness is lost, users should attempt to fall asleep in the [recovery position](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Recovery_position) or have a friend move them into it.
- **Stimulants** - Stimulants mask the [sedative](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation) effect of depressants, which is the main factor most people use to gauge their level of intoxication. Once the stimulant effects wear off, the effects of the depressant will significantly increase, leading to intensified [disinhibition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Disinhibition) , [motor control loss](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motor_control_loss) , and dangerous [black-out states](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amnesia) . This combination can also potentially result in severe dehydration if one's fluid intake is not closely monitored. If choosing to combine these substances, one should strictly limit themselves to a pre-set schedule of dosing only a certain amount per hour until a maximum threshold has been reached.

Clonazolam is a research chemical (RC) benzodiazepine. Though it was synthesized in the 1970s, it was never brought to market and it has only been used as an RC since the mid-2000s.

It’s a very potent substance, surpassing most benzodiazepines. Due to its potency and strength, it’s often been associated with amnesia and unconsciousness. Those risks exist with all drugs in the class, but the way people use clonazolam makes it more likely they’ll encounter a problem.

Many of the issues with the drug can be blamed on inappropriate dosing. Users believe the common dose is higher than it is and vendors sell products that are too strong. If you stick to a true light/common dose, most of the major concerns won’t apply.

Clonazolam = Clonitrazolam

PubChem: 12317881

Molecular formula: C17H12ClN5O2

Molecular weight: 353.766 g/mol

IUPAC: 6-(2-chlorophenyl)-1-methyl-8-nitro-4H-[1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-a][1,4]benzodiazepine

## Brief Overview Video

---

## Dose

#### Oral

Light: 100 – 250 μg (0.1 – 0.25 mg)

Common: 250 – 400 μg (0.25 – 0.4 mg)

Strong: 400 – 500 μg (0.4 – 0.5 mg)

---

## Timeline

**Oral**

Total: 7 – 12 hours

Onset: 00:30 – 00:45

Some users receive no or very light effects until 1-2 hours after administration. Redosing isn’t wise at any point, but it’s especially bad to redose in the first couple hours due to thinking your dose wasn’t strong enough.

Initially keeping it in your mouth for sublingual or buccal administration can shorten the onset to around 00:20. It can work that fast when swallowed, but sublingual/buccal appears more reliable with its speed.

Once it kicks in, the strength builds for at least an hour, sometimes longer. Then the peak is reached. The effects (e.g. sedation vs. anxiolysis being most prominent) can still change over the course of the experience.

The duration is dose-dependent. Strong+ doses can result in effects persisting well over 12 hours, while light doses may be largely gone in about 8 hours.

## Effects

#### Positive

- Anxiety reduction
- Mood lift
- Euphoria
- Muscle relaxation
- Sedation
- Increased talkativeness

#### Negative

- Amnesia
- Drowsiness
- Dizziness
- Impaired coordination
- Disinhibition
- Unconsciousness
- Cognitive impairment

Benzodiazepines come with some core effects, including anxiolysis, muscle relaxation, sleep-induction, impaired coordination, cognitive impairment, and disinhibition. But the relative strength of those effects can vary between drugs.

Clonazolam is usually considered a strongly sedating benzodiazepine with a higher propensity to cause amnesia and disinhibition. Many people have concerns about amnesia and disinhibition, but those are primarily an issue due to inappropriate dosing. Sticking to light/common amounts greatly lowers the chance of experiencing them.

With the exception of those who consider it “too strong” or “too potent,” users tend to like its effects. Some find it’s one of the most recreational benzodiazepines, though others report it’s only useful for sleep.

**Potency**

It does stand out from most benzodiazepines due to its potency. The drug can be felt at just 100-200 μg. This has proven to be an issue since some people believe 500+ μg is a common dose and vendors often sell 500 μg products. And there are many reports of people exceeding 1 mg.

#### VS other benzodiazepines

There’s variation in the reports about how it compares to other benzodiazepines, which is to be expected. Overall, people consider it more recreational than most, but there are reports of the opposite opinion.

Clonazepam

Its general feel is said to be similar to clonazepam, but there are significant differences. Clonazolam appears to be more sedating and more likely to produce recreational effects. While clonazepam can be better for use in functional situations.

Alprazolam

It’s described as stronger than alprazolam with its recreational and amnestic qualities.

Etizolam

Clonazolam is stronger with its positive and negative effects. It feels notably different from etizolam. Because of its greater impact on parameters like memory and energy, some users prefer etizolam for a larger set of situations.

#### Cognitive and Psychological Effects

Benzodiazepines, clonazolam included, usually produce a relaxed and care-free mental state. The majority of people don’t find they’re very recreational on their own, but they can make social activities more enjoyable and reduce stress when needed. Music enhancement is another potential effect.

For some, just experiencing greatly reduced anxiety and less overthinking can feel liberating and recreational. There are people who notice euphoria, but I wouldn’t go into clonazolam chasing that effect. If you don’t notice it by the time you’re using a strong dose, don’t keep pushing the drug into riskier dosage territory with the hopes of feeling great.

People with anxiety find it’s capable of almost entirely removing their normal anxious thought patterns. Though its muscle relaxing, sedative, and hypnotic properties seem to be stronger per-dose than anxiolysis.

**Sedation, Impairment, and Sleep**

It’s considered one of the most sedating benzos per dose. This property, along with having an easier time sleeping, is most significant during the first few hours. The sedation can be strong enough to actually make it an annoying quality of the drug, since not everyone is aiming to become tired. You could find yourself doing little more than sitting around or laying down.

After those hours are over the sedation can become less overwhelming.

Depending on the dose and person, a light or common amount might offer an experience with relatively minor sedation and perhaps a slightly energetic, uplifted buzz. But this varies a lot between people.

Cognitive impairment is an issue even at common doses, making it harder to complete tasks or have a conversation. Memory impairment is usually minor at common doses, but it can still make an appearance, particularly with short-term memory. Impairment could become frustrating if it’s getting in the way of an activity you want to accomplish.

Memory issues progress as the dose increases, producing partial blackouts for a portion of the experience and then amnesia for hours worth of time.

If you’re trying to remain functional and not come off as impaired, you’ll want to stick to doses around .1 to .2 mg. Impairment and other issues, like slurring your words, become more prominent after that point.

The hypnotic property of clonazolam makes it useful for natural insomnia or insomnia caused by the after effects of drugs like stimulants and psychedelics.

It has a pretty long duration, so it may be more likely to keep you asleep all night compared to a shorter-acting benzo, which might only be good for inducing sleep. The duration can be an issue due to grogginess and impairment when you wake up. If you need to drive or work less than 12 hours after you take it, avoiding the drug is preferable.

Impairment can last upwards of 12 hours depending on dose and people sometimes wake up still experiencing other effects like anxiolysis and muscle relaxation.

Benzodiazepines impair sleep architecture, but people usually get subjectively good sleep and even impaired sleep is still superior to insomnia.

Some users report vivid dreams when sleeping on clonazolam.

Especially when strong doses are used, an unpleasant hangover can be produced, featuring dizziness, nausea, low motivation, and ongoing sedation.

#### Physical

Motor coordination is impaired even at typical doses. You might not feel strongly affected in this regard, but you should avoid driving and demanding physical tasks regardless.

It’s common to have “wobbly” legs with common to strong doses, so holding onto things when moving can become a necessity.

Physical euphoria sometimes occurs, including with sensations of warmth and tingling.

## Chemistry & Pharmacology

#### Chemistry

Clonazolam is a benzodiazepine that’s structurally similar to clonazepam.

Both compounds feature a nitro group at the 7 position on the benzodiazepine ring structure, making them both nitrobenzodiazepines, and they also feature a chlorine group at the 2 prime position of each of their respective structures.

Clonazolam differs structurally from clonazepam by the substitution of a triazole ring onto the benzodiazepine ring structure to yield a triazolobenzodiazepine ring structure; therefore, clonazolam can also be referred to as a triazolobenzodiazepie.

(Bergstrand, 2016) – Clonazolam cross-reacts with benzodiazepine immunoassay tests

- It showed strong cross-reactivity on benzodiazepine immunoassay tests when looking for the parent compound. This was true for CEDIA, HEIA, EMIT II Plus, and KIMS II.

#### Pharmacology

Some pharmacology information exists, but none elucidating its activity at specific receptors. We do know the drug can cause a potent benzodiazepine-like response in animals. Coupled with its known effects in humans and its structure, clonazolam is most likely a benzodiazepine receptor agonist.

If so, that means it’s primarily having an impact by modulating GABA’s activity at GABAA receptors.

(Hester, 1971) – Early study showing benzodiazepine-like activity in animals.

- In a series of triazolobenzodiazepines, it was the most active overall, sometimes proving effective at under 10 μg/kg in mice.

#### Pharmacokinetics

(Hoiseth, 2016) – Report covering a handful of impaired driving cases in which clonazolam was detected

- Data source 
- Blood taken from suspected drugged drivers and some other criminal offenders in Norway.
- During the study period of July 2013 – May 2016 there were 22,022 cases with blood samples.
- Any of the novel designer benzodiazepines in question (clonazolam, diclazepam, flubromazepam, flubromazolam, pyrazolam, and etizolam) were found in 77 cases, 0.3% of the total. 
- 69 cases represented drugged drivers and in 14/69 there was a traffic accident. The other 8 cases involved other criminal acts, mainly violence. 
- Demographics: 88% male and median age of 27 (17-62 years)
- In 69 (90%), just one designer benzodiazepine was detected. In the remaining cases, 2 or 3 designer benzodiazepines were detected together.
- Most common novel designer benzodiazepines 
- Flubromazolam (25 cases), flubromazepam (24 cases), diclazepam (15), etizolam (14), clonazolam (7), and pyrazolam (1)
- Clonazolam concentration 
- Median from blood: 0.0053 mg/L
- Min: 0.0019 mg/L and Max: 0.011 mg/L

(Meyer, 2016) – Investigating the in vivo human urinary metabolite profile of clonazolam

- Sample source: Sweden’s STRIDA project, which collects information related to NPS use. 
- This study used urine samples from STRIDA to look at phase I and II metabolites.
- Clonazolam’s metabolism 
- Evidence supports extensive metabolism in humans.
- Mainly reduced to the 7-amino benzodiazepine and then acetylated. Clonazolam was also hydroxylated.
- Hydroxyclonazolam, 7-aminoclonazolam, and 7-acetaminoclonazolam were then conjugated with glucuronic acid.
- The most abundant metabolite in urine was 7-aminoclonazolam.

(Huppertz, 2015) – In vitro analysis of its metabolism using human liver microsomes

- Metabolic routes include monohydroxylation and reduction of the nitro group. Hydroxylation position is unknown, but most likely to be at the α- and 4- positions.

## History

#### 1971

It was synthesized and studied, as seen in (Hester, 1971). The drug was made by The Upjohn Company, the pharmaceutical company that would eventually bring alprazolam to the market. Though it was studied and covered by patents, it was never marketed.

#### 2013

Reports about its use as a research chemical began to appear online around 2013. It’s one of the more recent RC benzodiazepines and although it’s used by some people, it’s far less popular than prescription benzodiazepines or etizolam.

#### 2010s

Its presence in the market has sometimes been confirmed due to it showing up in drug tests, like with (Hoiseth, 2016).

(Blackberg, 2016) – A couple cases of it showing up alongside 3-FPM, based on data from Sweden’s STRIDA project. Among 19 samples testing positive for 3-FPM, 5 also contained clonazolam, typically alongside other depressant substances.

The EMCDDA says the detection of new benzodiazepines rose “markedly” in Europe in 2016. Over 300,000 tablets containing benzodiazepines (e.g. clonazolam, diclazepam, etizolam, and flubromazolam) were seized in 2015, nearly double the figure from 2014.

The EMCDDA was first notified of clonazolam’s presence in the EU in January 2015 with a report from Sweden.

## Safety

#### Risks

At common/strong doses, the primary risks are mental impairment (e.g. bad decision making), psychomotor impairment, and unintended unconsciousness.

#### Overdose

The risk of an accidental overdose is higher than with some of the less potent benzodiazepines. Those without a tolerance should never initially exceed a common dose.

Most benzodiazepine-only overdoses aren’t fatal, but they can still be dangerous due to severe impairment, sudden unconsciousness, disinhibition, and amnesia.

The greatest risk comes when combining them with other sedatives, like opioids and alcohol, among others. Drugs with a CNS depressant effect shouldn’t be mixed with clonazolam.

#### Physical Dependence

You’ll build a tolerance to the drug within a week if you’re using higher doses. As physical dependence grows, tolerance becomes more of an issue and the withdrawal symptoms upon cessation become more intense.

Tolerance may build at a different rate for different effects, such as mood lift declining faster than sedation.

Even within a few days of use it can sometimes lead to rebound effects, especially if you’re taking strong+ doses. Those effects include insomnia, anxiety, depression, and agitation. For some people with lower self-control, this can facilitate the start of a physical/psychological dependence.

Rebound symptoms tend to return to pre-benzodiazepine levels within 1-3 weeks of stopping your use. Though that’s not a very long time, the symptoms can still be very frustrating and uncomfortable, which often leads to people resuming their use.

Tapering is recommended. If you have a significant long-term dependence, a supervised detox is worthwhile.

**Withdrawal**

Common withdrawal symptoms include anxiety, cognitive impairment, insomnia, increased blood pressure, restlessness, shaking, and increased heart rate.

Severe withdrawal sometimes produces psychosis and seizures.

These symptoms likely arise from changes in the GABAA receptor complex that result in less inhibitory control on various neurotransmitter systems.

#### Risky Combinations

- Other depressants

Clonazolam (also known as clonitrazolam) is a drug of the triazolobenzodiazepine (TBZD) class, which are benzodiazepines (BZDs) fused with a triazole ring. Although little research has been done about its effects and metabolism, it is sold online as a designer drug.
The synthesis of clonazolam was first reported in 1971 and the drug was described as the most active compound in the series tested.
Depending on dose consumed, clonazolam may pose comparatively higher risk than other designer benzodiazepines due to its ability to produce strong sedation and amnesia at doses as small as 0.5 mg.

## Legality

### United Kingdom

In the UK, clonazolam has been classified as a Class C drug by the May 2017 amendment to The Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 along with several other designer benzodiazepine drugs.

### United States

It is a Schedule I controlled substance in the United States and is not FDA approved for human consumption. Virginia state law has declared all of the following related medications are Schedule I: clonazolam, etizolam, flualprazolam, flubromazolam, and flubromazepam. Minnesota declared clonazolam a Schedule I drug in August 2020.
On 23 December 2022, the DEA announced it had begun consideration on the matter of placing clonazolam under temporary Schedule I status. 
Later on 25 July 2023, the DEA published a pre-print notice that clonazolam would become temporarily scheduled as a controlled substance from 26 July 2023 to 26 July 2025. On 25 July 2025, and effective the following day, the DEA extended the temporary scheduling until 26 July 2026.

### Australia

In Australia, clonazolam is Schedule 9 under federal law.

### Sweden

Sweden's public health agency suggested classifying clonazolam as a hazardous substance on 1 June 2015.

## Effects

Clonazolam's effects are similar to other benzodiazepines, such as anxiolysis, disinhibition, lethargy, muscle relaxation, and euphoria. While no dose of clonazolam is considered "safe" due to its lack of research and extreme potency, doses higher than 0.5 mg can cause benzodiazepine overdose in some individuals. The effects of a benzodiazepine overdose include sedation, confusion, amnesia, insufficient breathing, loss of consciousness, and death. Because dependence can occur in a short period of time, or even with a large initial dose, withdrawal symptoms (including seizures and death) may occur acutely following the period of intoxication.
